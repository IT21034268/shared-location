4,Perfect fit,"I have a Bissell model 3590. these worked perfectly on my machine. Originally, I did not have the round filter. So this was a new addition to my machine. I would stress that you should clean the round barrel that the round filter will go around thoroughly. After doing this I think the suction improved (since like I said the round filter did not come with my machine originally). If there are questions on installation Bissell's website does have some instructions. However, I noted that i could get the products from Amazon for less money and free shipping."
4,Good phone and answering machine,"Good corded phone with answering machine. Has all the features you need at a good price. It's worked great so far, and I recommend it."
2,Phone Review,"The information on the web regarding this phone indicates that it is/was a 2-line phone. In reality, it is only a 1-line phone with three buttons to use the single line. Otherwise the phone works good."
2,A few problems you should know about before buying,"Overall I'm disappointed in this unit. The main reason is that the touch-tone keys have a delay between when you press them and when they make their sound. No telephone should act like that.The other major thing to be warned about is that while the LCD is legible when the phone is placed on a table-top, it's not good when the phone is wall mounted. When wall-mounted, the LCD only has full readability if your eyes are below the phone. Normally on a wall, the phone would be below eye level, in which case the LCD isn't so good, and it only becomes legible when the room is brightly lit.On the good side, the software user interface is very nicely done.I will be relegating this unit to a location where it'll only be used as an answering machine, not as a telephone. For my main home answering machine / telephone, I've gotten a competing unit from AT&T;, which is better as regards both of the issues mentioned above."
4,All the options with a couple flaws,"I've owned Panasonic products for years and been very satisfied with the quality. This product performs well but overall quality seems to have dropped from the last Panasoic phones I've owned. The buttons have a softer feel and seem to register slower when pushed. Also, the display has no backlighting and is very difficult to see, even with the contrast set to the highest setting."
4,Primarily a desk phone,"This telephone has attractive programmable features for those so inclined, and performs well, provided it's located fairly close to an electric outlet. If used in a home that has a DSL internet connection, you'll probably have to install a filter between the phone and the telephone jack. Relocating a segment from the back of the plastic body enables the phone to be wall mounted. This is not too easily done because of the long telephone line that must be packed into the interior of the bracket. The DSL filter will make the phone hang farther out from the wall as well. Panasonic tells me they do not sell a longer handset cord to replace the short cord which they supply, so if the phone is mounted on the wall you may have to buy an off-color aftermarket cord. As a wall mounted phone I should downrate it a bit because of these factors."
1,Defective-Returned,"I was initially pleased with the phone, except that the caller ID is not backlit so hard to read. Then I discovered that if a call was answered on another phone in the house, the person picking up this phone to join the conversation could not be heard. Did troubleshooting with Panasonic customer service and they determined phone was defective. Returned to Amazon for refund - chose a different phone."
2,Less useful than expected,"I needed a speakerphone and there were a lot to choose from. If don't need the speakerphone feature, this one is OK. But as a speakerphone it is not reliable, the microphone cuts in and out. For me, it was a waste of $50.00."
4,Wall mount unit,We are very happy with this unit. It has eliminated the humming that was in our older phone.
1,First Panasonic Product Disappointed In,Looked cheaply made when I unpacked it... but the worst part was in using it. I use the speaker phone feature most of the time and the digital microphone communication was very broken up on the phone calls that I used it on. It was to the point that I just hooked my old phone back up and gave up. I now use it in an area where I rarely need to use a phone.... This is the first Panasonic product that I have ever got that is a piece of junk in my opinion..... I will have to look at anything made by Panasonic now in person before I'd even consider buying it now.........wouldn't have ever believed that a Panasonic product would ever have had such poor quality -- until now.........
2,poor phone,I got this phone for use at my office and I am pretty dissapointed. The memory on the answering machine seems to be very limited and fills up easily. It probably doesn't manage gaps in the memory from deleted messages very well. The display started failing a few months after I bought it and now after a year it is completely illegible. Not the quality I am used to from Panasonic.
2,Thought I found the perfect phone.,"I purchased this phone for my mother because of the large buttons and answering machine. There was so much static no matter where I plugged it in and no other channel options, I returned it."
2,Died After 3 or 4 Years,"Was a good phone, with slightly weak microphone, but mine died after three or four years."
2,Imagine the Possibilities,"I'm astonished at all the positive reviews this ""answering system"":has received. The LED screen may just as well have been omitted; it's utterly unreadable. How, since the telephone has to be plugged in anyway, a light couldn't have been installed is beyond me. You'll also enjoy wading through the instruction manual, clearly written by a resident geek somewhere and terribly difficult to fathom. Worse yet, this seems to be the best phone option out there. Imagine that."
4,"Good Phone, but...","This phone does everything you would expect it to. The answering machine is clear and easy to use. The phone book is simple, scroll to the person you want to call and just lift the receiver. The one drawback is there is no back light for the Caller ID. I have to leave a little flashlight by the phone to read the LCD display. Other than that little oversight, I highly recommend it."
3,"Decent home office phone, with 1 serious flaw","This phone is missing just 1 feature to make it the perfect office phone for me: a light that indicates when I am on mute. I am on a lot of conference calls, and this phone works well with my plantronics MX10 amplified head set, but the display is hard to read and although it indicates (mute) I need to really concentrate to read the display. There is also an audible que when you turn mute on and off, but it is the same both times and after a while I just don't remember and need to check. Note that the audible tone is not transmitted to the others on the call, which is good.As others have mentioned the display can be hard to read. I do not find the keys mushy, but perhaps that is because the phone keeps up with my dialing speed. I do find the keys to be well spaced for my normal sized hands."
2,Display is NOT readable,"Setup: Easy enough with instruction book open.Display: Unacceptable. I might as well put tape over it because it's completely unreadable under any lighting conditions, any direction. Need to shine a flashlight on it to view.Sound Quality: Below Averge. Handset has volumne control, but external mic is very weak.Messages: Average. Greeting can only be recorded from external mic.Back to the store for this one. A waste of time and money."
4,A classic kit,I was impresed with this kit for the posabiliy of it considering its a no grade kit. I would recamend this kit to any gundam wing fan. I recamend painting the the gray plastic pieces white then adding pannel lines to give it the details it needs.
5,KUDOS TO ARTHUR MARX AND FRANK FERRANTE!!,This book is simply gorgeous! Thank you Thank you Thank you to Arthur Marx and Frank Ferrante for keeping we Groucho and Marx Brothers fans near and dear to their hearts. This book has beautiful never-before-seen photos of Groucho including Groucho at play! 187 pages isn't nearly enough!! I hope we will see additional Photographic Journeys of the rest of the Marx's.
5,GROUCHO FANS REJOICE!,"Finally, some new material on the Marx Brothers! I've found the recent books on the Marx Bros. like Kanfer's and Louvish's interesting but not earth shattering. Arthur Marx's new book gives us the REAL Groucho in photos. It's a great look at a great comic artist...Arthur has out done himself. I saw his play on PBS and it is just as warm and revealing..."
5,Fantastic game,"If you like creating, genetics and surprizes this game is for you. Not particularly fast-paced, it is relaxing and contemplative. Speed options are great and the fish animations are fantastic!"
2,Chirps after two months of Use,"I bought this from Amazon to use on my calphalon wok. After daily use for about 1 month, we realise that the tip chirps. The scoop design is useful but the material used does not withstand the heat."
4,The Hipster Spies With His Little Eye-----Ga--RRROOOOOO-vey tunes!,"A brief intro by the Fabulous Wolfman Jack leads into a nifty collection of crusin sounds, includin that hot rod Lincoln & some Beach Boys tunes. Not to mention ""Leader Of The Pack"". All tributes to cars, motorcycles & crusin.And all original artists, no lamer substitutes!Would be 5 stars, if they had added Route 66.The Hipster gives it a thumbs up!"
3,Speculative,"While this book was interesting to read, I fear it may appeal more to conspiracy theorists than the casual reader. Explaining Tesla's death ray was informative, but connecting it to the space shuttle disaster is reaching. Admittedly, the follow up investigation did seem to indicate that something was amiss with this incident if these stories are true. Sadly, when one finishes this book, he or she is still left with many unanswered questions."
1,HORRIBLE!,"Don't waste your money on this movie! It is absolutely horrible and redolent of bad Italian horror films of the seventies. I'm not sure what the director had in mind but it is all wrong and has nothing to do with the real Sister Smile. The Belgian film ""Souer Sourire"" is much better in every way!"
3,Oddly out of date,"No guide is perfect, but some are better than others. In the case of Lonely Planet, some are great, others leave a bit to be desired. For whatever reason, the Kyoto guide is missing some important pieces of information that I would have wanted to see. For example, the best vegetarian restaurant in the city, and one of the few places a veggie can eat some authentic Japanese ""meat"" dishes (made with fake meat) is the Peace Cafe -- which is not listed in Lonely Planet though it's been around for a few years. Another example: The ""japanese-only guides"" at the Shigakuin Imperial Residence still holds true.... except they have a full audio guide now, recorded in English, with lots of information at most stops made by the Japanese tour."
5,This is the one !,This book has so many information about Kyoto.Especially accommodation sect is wonderful. My friend stayed at the Tour Club and he could enjoy his stay in Kyoto very much (Tour Club is recommended by this book as by far the best guesthouse.)Also information and comment about sites are useful.
3,Other guides?,"I borrowed this guide from a friend and have leafed through it. I haven't decided if I want to buy it yet when I go to Kyoto later this year.What do you guys recommend as the best travel guide for Kyoto? While skimming this one, I've noticed a few of the things mentioned here like the unorganized maps and such. But are there betters one there to buy?"
2,Frustrating to use,"Kyoto is a city famous mostly for its ancient temples. The Lonely Planet Kyoto guidebook does a good job listing them, but it is almost impossible to determine which are good to visit using the minimal one-paragraph descriptions. Small illustrations and longer descriptions would make this guidebook more worthwhile.Curiously, the book neglects to mention Horyuji temple in its excursion section to Nara. Horyuji contains the world's oldest wooden buildings."
5,Born Twice,"This book is about a family with a ""special"" child. The child has MS & has trouble walking, writing, talking & just about everything we take for granted in a ""normal"" children.Most books of fiction do not touch on this sensitive subject... and without the Mother Theresa syndrome of the happy ending, Born Twice shows the pain & embarrasement of having a special child.Everywhere someone is looking & wondering about you & your child, but it's really not about other people - it's about you and how you accept your life, full of challenges.""The Keys to the House"", is a brilliant & sensitive Italian sub-titled movie where Charlotte Rampling is holding the book Born Twice in her hands throughout the film."
1,Born Twice,"I did not care for this book. Although the topic, a parent's feelings about living with a severely disabled child, is an interesting one, the author creates a character who is so selfish and self-centered that it's almost unbearable. Characters, like his mistress, appear, have a fit, and aren't mentioned again. I don't know why this book got such accolades in Italy. Nothing uplifting or enlightening here."
2,A story-challenged novel,"Wow, I really did not get this novel at all. It seemed less a novel than a disjointed series of semi-scenes. The characters are all indistinct, with the exception perhaps of the narrator, who seems more interested in philosophizing or coining aphorisms than telling us what's going on. Even the supposed subject of the novel, the narrator's disabled son, barely seems to materialize. The novel lacks a story, with many promising avenues going unexplored.In the end, I felt so much more could have been said, and so much less too."
3,a few gems in there,"I really like the techno cover of Wrapped Around Your Finger. While You See A Chance is a nice cover too. If you want LA Style, get their album -- this remix does not add much. The rest I can do without, but maybe somebody will like them.Tracks:Ernon - Wrapped Around Your FingerKam Joyce - While You See A ChanceLet It BeObumbrattaTurn Me AroundRitmo De La Noche Techno RemixThe MegamixL. A. Style - O Si NeneAprovechaAnthrophia - Chemical ReactionBit Max - Can You Feel It Babe"
3,Romance Lover,I saw this movie when I was young on TV and liked it really well. Seeing it again after all these years I can see that I didn't have very high standards back then. Maybe the film would have been better if it had been digitally transferred to DVD.
1,Didn't realize it was a cartoon,"I somehow didn't read that this book is in cartoon form. Not suitable for the child I had bought it for at all. Boring dialogues. Cute pictures, but too many per page, visual overload."
1,Rotten Handle,"On our first walk down the street, the handle started to buckle and peel, in big chunks (before any rain hit it)! It's faux wood looking and now there are big white chunks on the bottom, and it still hasn't actually rained. I emailed Amazon and the particular retailer a week ago, and haven't heard anything back yet! :("
2,"Large, but breaks easily","It is a large umbrella, which is why I bought it despite some of the marginal reviews. I've had it for about 4 months. In that time, the wood handle has split, come unglued, and falls off the shaft. If I were to hold the umbrella simply by the handle, a good updraft would see my umbrella floating away with a wood handle in my hand. Secondly, the velcro tabs on the closure straps have ripped away from the straps and I need to sew them back on. Thirdly, the plastic tip is very soft and I expect it to wear out before the umbrella. Lastly, the umbrella has a tendency to not stay closed, unless you use the velcro straps, hence the velcro failure is a real pain. I would not buy it or any product from GustBuster, nor would I recommend it to anyone. There have to be better quality umbrellas out there."
4,Nice Umbrella,Umbrella is great minus the fact that there was a small plastic cap that gets glued/nailed into the top portion of the umbrella. The small nail seemed to split the plastic cap and it fell off. Cant say I think this is the best method to secure the top but I dont make umbrellas.Doesnt seem to affect the umbrella and I didnt feel like dealing with shipping etc again so I just kept it.
5,Best Gift Yet,"I bought this umbrella for my mom for christmas a couple of years ago. We live in Los Angeles and don't get much rain, but when it does rain, it pours and is windy. Every time I go over to her house and rain or umbrellas are brought up, she says that this is the best umbrella she has ever had. She loves it and it is sturdy and holds up. I am very happy with my purchase and so is she."
4,Best Umbrella Ever,"This Umbrella, is the best. I got the larger one but my other one lasted the whole rain season.I am hooked for life."
5,hygienic and functional feeder,"I had a smaller similar feeder that didn't work. I had to shake it to make the pellets drop to the feed section. I threw that one away when I got this because the Little Giant7 feeder actually works. It's the perfect size for my Flemish Giant rabbit babies, and now that I've tested it I'm getting more for other rabbits.These feeders are a lot easier to use than bowls that I have to clean every day. Rabbit pellets have dust and the sifter removes the dust. I used a wire clipper to cut a hole in the cage to fit the feeder, and it attached easily to the 1/2"" x 1"" wire cage. Also, my rabbits no longer add their droppings or urinate in the cage, so it's much more hygienic than a feeding bowl."
4,Works Well,"I use a battery operated grinder when I'm at home, but this is my grinder when I'm on the road. It's solid, well-made and works well. For $20, this is the grinder I recommend. If I lose the one I've got, I'll be buying another one of these."
1,"Weird mismatch of colors, and poor construction","Product was mismatched from piece to piece as if they slapped multiple units together into one. In addition, the threads did not match up correctly on the bottom piece which makes assembly impossible.I would not recommend. For the price, this thing should be a lot better."
3,Product pictured is not what was received in mail,"The grinder itself feels very smooth, grinds nicely, but with a bit of a loose cap (strong magnet though), and is overall a quality product, but the grinder that I received in the mail was different than the picture provided.The grinder I received had 5 pieces and 4 chambers, as opposed to the pictured 4 piece/3 chamber grinder as was pictured.The result of this was that the extra chamber took up room that should have been more storage area for the ground herbs.There is very minimal room for the herb to be stored in the grinder (only a 1/2cm layer of herb can be stored at one time), there are two identical storage areas so i get around this by grinding some herbs into one layer, then grinding more into the other layer to save for later.I would have preferred one larger storage layer, but it's a quality tobacco/herb grinder and I am otherwise satisfied with the product, plus $20 is a very good price for the grinder."
3,holey moley!,It works but there are to many holes in it and the crushed items are bigger. I like the sharpstone better. It scissors the items with sharp blades.
2,Not the item I ordered.,"I bought this item because of the Chromium Crusher's reputation for producing a good *herb grinder. However, (as a previous reviewer mentioned), the item pictured is not what they send you in the mail. I would caution against buying this, because you are not getting the deal you think you are. (The grinder they do send you is okay, just not what they advertised.)eBay is the best place to find herb grinders. (cheaper, more reliable, and high quality)"
2,2.25 chromium grinder,"The Item was shipped quickly, however, not as described... A little disappointed because i was expecting something else, but over all, a good deal..."
5,Great product,I have had mine for about six months now. The price is great and so far it has been pretty reliable and is very well built.
4,Decent Product for the Money,"It took me a long time to decide on what herb grinder to purchase, & I finally chose this one mainly because it was on sale. I am very pleased with it. It does an excellent job. I don't feel the pieces screw together as smoothly as I would like them to, but they work just fine. For the price I paid & the product I received, I am very happy."
2,Highly Unsatisfied,"It ground all of the herbs too fine. Not great for rolling. Also had some problems grinding some stems, that were easily broken down. Also managed to get stuck as i was trying to grind. The screen is too fine to do much of anything, and the kiefcatcher takes quite some effort to screw in. It feels pretty heavy which is a good thing, but it seems poorly made."
3,Mort,This is a great grinder only problem is the magnet sometimes pops out if you don't lose it it is an easy fix a drop of super glue brings it to perfect condition
4,The Price Is A STEAL!,"Friends of mine have commented on this grinder saying how much they like it.Pros-Grinds herb with minimal effort, the teeth are VERY sharp-Screen works very well (You get very fine, almost dust-like material)-Fits comfortably in your hands, has a little weight that most grinders don't so it feels nice to hold.-Easily kept in your pocket-Came with a little carrying pouch-Very cheap for the quality-DurableCons-Finger Prints are easily seen on the outside, making it less attractive, easily wiped off with a cloth.-Storage area is rather small for non-screened herb (My guess is for better screening)-Threads have to be aligned perfectly or you will cross-thread-Grinded herb accumulates in the threads, sometimes making it a little harder to close.I am very satisfied with this grinder."
2,Not the best product I have seen on the market,This product came with rough edges that should have been machined off. It looked sloppy.
4,good for the price,"it works well grinding the herbs. I would have given it a 5 but the mesh is somehow warped. Although its just a small cosmetic flaw, from that I don't really think the quality control is as good, but hey for the price you can't really beat it."
4,I like the Crusher,The Crusher does what it is designed to do and does it exceedingly well. The fifth star is missing only because the small magnet fell out. The magnet is unnecessary.
3,Almost great,"Only prob is it doesn't have a strong magnet. Otherwise sharp teeth, nice mulch, fine screen. It comes in a pouch so it won't fall apart, but I give it a 3 for the sucky magnet that is probably really cheap.."
3,Not bad,i ordered 1 and 2 came in. I dont kno if it was charged from my account. Other than that the grinders are the best
1,BROKEN,The very bottom compartment was broken. Everyone knows the bottom is important. I lost stuff ughhhh. Product would of been good if it wash't broken.
1,top broke,"right when i first went to use it the top broke, the crapy pllastic tor got seperated from the metal peice"
5,Great Grinder,"This is a great grinder. I got this in the mail 3 days before expected arrival because the seller got it out to me so quickly. This grinders feels great and has a professional feel. I'm sure that I'll have this grinder for a very, very long time considering the quality of construction and usefulness of the grinder. I recommend this grinder."
4,Shark hand vac,Easy to use except it is a nuisance to have to keep my finger on the power button to keep it going.
4,Good for the price,"I needed a nice hand vac for cleaning up those crumbs people leave on the kitchen counter that aren't worth getting the whole vacuum out for, but also too hard to pick up with a paper towel.It does it's job, though I wish the suction was better."
5,truism,"The reviewers are correct. This little machine is well worth the money and does a terrific job. A great picker-upper! If it ever stops working, I'll buy another one."
2,not what i expected,this hand vac for some reason does not do the job i expected. it misses alot of things on the floor. i also used it in the car with not the expected results.
2,Disappointed,"This is a very cheap product. I like my shark sweeper but have returned this item. It is not easy to remove the casing to empty and the filter is nasty to clean. Even though my old dustbuster loses its charge quickly, it is still a better product than this one."
1,Horrible quality,Do Not waste your time (or landfill space) with this vacuum. It no longer charges and was never good at actually picking anything up...even the lightest of dirt.Spend your money more wisely - avoid this item!!!
4,"First album, first great experience","The first album from Seru Giran is the definitive set of progresive latin-rock. With four of the greatest musicians from Argentina (Charly Garcia, David Lebón, Pedro Aznar and Oscar Moro) and an orchestra, their sound is outstanding and original, but isn't a good introduction to the band because they'll change the approach with their next album.For the fans of Seru or Charly, this set contains three all-time classics: Eite Leda (a concert favorite), Seminare (one of the Latin-Rock greatest ballads of all time) and Seru Giran (for Charly Garcia's MTV Unplugged fans, the intro of Seru Giran Medley). Furthermore, it doesn't contains any filler. So, why four stars? Because it have 32:00 minutes of running time, too little time to show or explore the musical ideas only hinted here (i give it 4 1/2 stars).A must for any Charly Garcia fan."
5,This cd is the best cd i've ever heard!,"This guy (Rolf maier bode) really knows how to make music. You can listen to the record over and over again and you never get tired of it! I personally own all rmb cd's including ""This World Is Yours"" and ""Widescreen"" and both deliver really good tunes. I recommend this record to people who like groups in the Techno-Rave genre."
4,A great example of classical techno!,"RMB, which stands for Rolph-Maier Bode is a wonderful example of quality techno. His music is undurpassed in complexity and delivery. On RMB's most recent album (the longest cd ever recored) there is an unbelievable 76 minutes of music, I know your only supposed to be able to fit 74, but somehow they did it. I might note that RMB has many other singles not on Amazon.com if you like these guys you may want to look around a bit. Rmb is characterized by theur lack of filler songs, every song is a bit different, but all are great to listen or dance to."
4,Interesting format,"This book is divided into two sections, a short narrative and a collection of contemporary photos. The photos are what really makes the book, spanning as they do from the turn of the century to the end of the Civil War they show aspects of that desperate struggle between pro- and anti-treaty forces which one might otherwise miss. At the very least this book should supplement the collection of any historian interested in this particular chapter in Irish history."
5,Absolutely Breathtaking Courage,"This book really portrays the hope,courage and freedom that the Irish Free State leaders possessed.The brains and guts that it took to carry out such a mission were only shown to us by MICHAEL COLLINS & EAMON DEVALERA.This book feels as if you were up there fighting with our heroes. It really makes you wish that you were there.... in The Irish Civil War"
1,Used twice and it broke - Garbage,"My wife is a school teacher and escorts pre-schoolers from the school bus to the school door each day. This umbrella lasted exactly TWO rainy days before the clasp near the top of the umbrella that holds it in the open position collapsed into the umbrella stick, making the umbrella useless. It no longer stays in the open position. Lesson learned? ..... Go to some golf shop and buy a nice umbrella from them, I guess."
3,Poor Handle & tip,"This umbrella arrived damaged; both the handle and tip were broken, and appeared very flimsy. The rest of the umbrella seems sturdy enough,but is useless without a proper handle and tip."
1,Do not buy,"This umbrella is too big. Secondly, the latch broke after the second use. I contacted GustBuster regarding the ""lifetime warranty"" but never received word back. I got ripped off..."
1,Poor Quality,I would not recommend this product. It is made with poor quality and definitely NOT worth the price. It broke after 1 use.
3,Huge Size,I bought this product looking for a wider coverage than traditional but it is extremely big. I donated to my building because it looks good. It's not for an average individual.
2,Poor Quality,"It is a large umbrella, which is why I bought it despite some of the marginal reviews. I've had it for about 4 months. In that time, the wood handle has split, come unglued, and falls off the shaft. If I were to hold the umbrella simply by the handle, a good updraft would see my umbrella floating away with a wood handle in my hand. Secondly, the velcro tabs on the closure straps have ripped away from the straps and I need to sew them back on. Thirdly, the plastic tip is very soft and I expect it to wear out before the umbrella. Lastly, the umbrella has a tendency to not stay closed, unless you use the velcro straps, hence the velcro failure is a real pain. I would not buy it or any product from GustBuster, nor would I recommend it to anyone. There have to be better quality umbrellas out there."
3,For a younger crowd,A little too fussy and a little to young for me but very cute for a young lady. A lot going on with this shoe. Size ran a little small. Ordered a 9 and need a 9 1/2. Had to send back anyway.
2,picture is not clear,"This camera is ok,good for baby monitor but other than that not goodCons:1.Picture is not clear2.Picture refresh rate is very slow3.Can not see anything in dark"
3,It's okay,"I originally had these wipes come with a guitar I bought, and they were nice and wet. I think the wipes dried up in the container I bought, and didn't work very well."
3,okay for kids,the cover seems as if it would be a good book for a kid to use for a book report. This is why i purchased it. Not as kid friendly when you get it and start reading it.
4,"if you are Irish or like me just live in Ireland, it is essential reading.",very well written and tells you all you need to know about Ireland.you can now talk with some accuracy about Ireland
1,Might be helpful for grade-schoolers,"I received this book as a gift and was put off right away by the garish cover and was even more disappointed by the content. It's a very simplistic outline of Irish history, complete with dumbed-down definitions of ""Catholic"" and ""Presbyterian"" for the edification of the reader, who really should be no older than 12 to appreciate the cartoon-like artwork in the book. Coloring-book style drawings of such notables as St. Patrick, Cromwell and a generic leprechaun are included. The text is littered with big letter ""E's"" (for Eire, get it?) that are supposed to indicate something important. I don't know why they just didn't title it Ireland for Dummies. That was obviously what the authors thought about their subject."
2,good content - bad book,"This book has great content and was used in my fourth year of medical technology studies. However, it gets a two star rating because after about two weeks of solid use the binding falls apart and pages come unglued from the seam and fall out."
2,"Very good Nay, but shame on the rest!","The Nay music is outstanding, but the accompanying music mostly keyboards and ultra modern sounds just don't fit at all and detracts from the excellent nay. Oh, well, what a shame to spoil such excellent music!"
4,RV rack,arrived quickly and it serves our need it will save space for other items that need to be under cover
1,Didn't Work,"I purchased this product as a replacement for my base unit that quit working. I have 8 handsets for it. I got the base unit and it didn't work. I couldn't send it back as the package was opened. How do you know if a product is defective if you don't open it? Also, Panasonic would replace it for me but not with a base unit that is compatible with my handsets. I lost $100.00 on this deal."
1,Blue Tooth does not work: do not buy,"This is a worthless ""Cell Phone"" product. It does not work with MOST cell phones. Good thing Amazon will take this back."
2,NOT 5.8ghz...Actually 2.4GHZ,Not a bad phone. The 2.4ghz freq wrecks havoc on Wireless video and wireless networks. Go with the AT&T EP5632. It is a TRUE 5.8ghz phone.
1,Very bad experience,"When I ordered the product, I misunderstood that it was a single line telephone rather than a two line telephone. I returned the product and ordered the two line telephone from Amazon. Over one month later, and after repeated promises, e-mail and telephone confirmations to provide a credit for the returned telephone, Amazon has still not credited my account. Make sure that before you order it is exactly what you want as you may never get your money back."
1,Buyer Beware!!,"Recently purchased this item with the hope that calls coming in through my cell would transfer to the base unit. Prior to purchasing the unit and handset, I checked Panasonic's website to be certain my MotoRazr V3 was compatible. According to their site, V3 is a compatible phone so I bought the Panasonic. Unfortunately, V3 (or at least my V3) has 2.0 bluetooth. The Panasonic KX-TH111s is ONLY compatible if your bluetooth is 1.1 or 1.2!Was greatly disappointed in the product and have returned it after several calls to Panasonic tech support."
1,Bluetooth Problems,"I purchased this cordless telephone to work with my Sprint Pocket PC Cell Phone, also known as the PPC-6700. The bluetooth connection located the cell phone and established the proper connection.Every call placed and received from the cordless KX-TH11S worked as expected but the volume was very low and weak. This was a problem for both the caller and the person called. After a dozen or more calls, I determined this low volume unacceptable and returned the unit.Still looking for a solution to merge my bluetooth cell phone to a cordless telephone, I purchased the at&t; EP5632 to see how it would perform. The at&t; cordless telephone worked great with the cell phone calls, both incoming and outgoing. All volume levels are good. Problem solved."
2,Bluetooth only with specifice cell phones,I thought that bluetooth compatible was bluetooth compatible. Apparently not for Panasonic. Be careful before you buy!
1,Panasonic Quality Low,This is the second Panasonic cordless phone I've purchased in 4 years after the first one died. I should have learned my lesson as this one just died 5 weeks out of warranty after I just put another $200 into additional handsets for it. Panasonic customer service was gracious enough to offer to repair it but they quoted me a cost for more than it would be to buy a new one. I like the features panasonic offers but I'm switching brands.
3,just average,"Although this phone is a Panasonic & i've had great results with other panosonic products, it is not nearly as good as previous phones i've used. The battery life is short, the phone is hard to hold without hands. The sound is not bad, and the answer machine part is fine, but I wouldn't purchase it again."
1,Two Dead Bases!!!,"We bought a base station and four expansion phones. The base station stopped working not long after the warranty period expired. Rather than lose the hundreds of dollars we invested in expansion phones, we bought a second base. The second base stopped working ten months later. Same problem: the display goes blank, the phone unit charges when placed on the cradle, but we can't make or receive calls because the phone doesn't register the base unit. We swapped power cords, tried different phone cords, tried different phone jacks, tried different power outlets. Conclusion: the bases are both defective. Buyer beware!!! This is a waste of money."
2,Base Station Problems,I am on my third base station for these phones. We like the phones and have five of them scattered over the house. We do not use the Cell converge feature as it never worked well for us. The base stations seem to go bad and we have to order another base station. Probably this will be our last base station as we will most likely change telephone systems. I have grown weary of reprogramming all phones and base stations.
3,Looks wonderful,Looks wonderful but is a tad on the small side. Bought this as a gift and have gotten complaints that it is too small to tell time on. Person I gave it too had trouble reading it.
5,So beautiful!,"I'm really enjoying this watch. It's beautiful and lightweight. The black face and white hands make it easier to read than other watches of this size. I like to wear a watch loose like a bangle, so haven't removed any of the band extensions, yet the face of the watch stays on the top of my wrist. Instead of the flat black shown in the photo, mine is a glossy, dark, warm charcoal color, which I think is even prettier than the photo. It's nice having a choice other than silver or gold watches. Two two golden links are just the right touch. The description says ""dress,"" but I wear it all of the time. Purchased it from Amazon, and it arrived within 7 days of when I ordered it with Super Saver shipping. Very happy with my purchase."
4,A CLASSIC FPS SERIES ARRIVE ON XBOX.,Yep-no all we need is 007 goldeneye-and not made by ea!-But by RARE of coasre!
2,dosen't live up to the hype,"doom 3 has awesome graphics, but it lacks in everything else.the storyline was thin,the gameplay was just average FPS stuff,the A.I. was terrible, you could outsmart the demons every time(mabey endless hours of Halo and Halo 2 just made me smarter),the mutiplayer seemed limitedand the music wasn't anything special, either. I may seem a little judgemental but once you've played the Halo series, you have a natural instinct to compare every game to it. take my opinion, buy halo and halo 2 first. both those games have better music, multiplayer, storyline, A.I. and gameplay. although Doom 3 may have better graphics, all you ever see is demons and blood. halo and halo 2 however, take you to tropical islands to snow-capped moutains to metropolis citys, and every where between.just my two cents"
2,Burn your Xbox,"Doom 3's graphics engine is amazing. It looks very good.Xbox cannot handle the origonal engine very well.Doom 3 on Xbox looks terrible, and the gameplay is pointless. The only draw for the computer version is the fact that it looks awesome. I does not on Xbox."
2,Too Disturbing,"I liked this game initially, and after beating it I put it away for awhile. About a year later I went back to give it another whirl and found it completely disturbing. I mean, I know - it's supposed to be, but I found the actual gameplay disturbing.And This comes from someone who was raised on the series - from the first PC version and Wolfenstein on the Commodore 64.The fun was gone for me. The graphics were there, the action was there, but it just lacked something... As i could play Doom 1 & 2 for hours upon hours, I couldn't stand another 10 minutes of this game. It lacked the draw and fun of say, the Half-Life games.I hope Quake 4 is better."
3,Beautiful but Boring,"Doom 3 is an okay game.The graphics, sound are great though.The game has weak fealling gameplay. You don't really get drawn in to the game like you should. Also the lack of charectors and story makes you feal you are there without a purpose. Surviving in the game is simple, there is no thaught to the combat.The game is scray for about five minutes until you get the hang of it. Then you practically know where and when each monster is going to appear.I don't recomend this game to anyone."
1,Doom3,The game would not open. It was not worth the effort to send it back. This is the second review I have submitted. The product did not function.
2,Don't Bother,"Played this game for 15 minutes, took it out, and never played it again. It of course in an Xbox game not Xbox 360 so it gets a pass."
2,Doomed!,"Doom is supposed to be a fun game. Instead, you are weak, carry weak guns, and you don't even talk. in the game, you fight zombies over and over again it gets boring after 5 minutes or so.Also, you get lost easily because it's so damned dark and monsters leap out behind walls. also, you can't use your flashlight while you shoot. you have to shoot randomly. there is also to much gore in this game it is counted as one of the most violent game.doom came out a few months ago and it is 20 dollars on the pc.don't think because there are guns and monsters in this games it is a good game.here is my overall score.graphics 7/10sound 5/10gameplay 4/10controls 8/10storyline 4/10fun factor 2/10overall 4/10now, don't get offended because i say it is not good and you like it. i am only saying what i think about the game. I'd reccomend other games like halo, zelda, mech assault, metroid, and resident evil."
3,acceptable item,"the item was here on time but the item had some scratches on it which caused the game to freeze in spots. it was still playable and the freezes were infrequent but I wouldn't call this item to be ""very good condition"" as described, maybe acceptable is more like it. overall though it was a good purchase in the end."
1,Not for the regular Joe,"I just played for almost an hour and was dissapointed. There's just too much ocultism there. Pentagrams everywhere since the start, even the ""loading"" icon was a pentagram. I just can't enjoy it being a Jesus follower. I threw away $45."
4,buck wizard...,"Remember how entertaining Doom was? Imagine getting to relive that nostalgic experience but with unbelievable graphics atmosphere and even *gasp* a less ridiculous story. Id has managed to capture everything about the first 2 dooms and still add to it enough to make it compete with(and usually beat) most current games. I am a huge fan of the shotgun but in most FPSs the shotgun is rare and unpractical, in this respect doom 3 is a dream come true. If you don't like shotguns or visiting hell than don't waste your time, if you do this well the ride of your life."
4,"death, destruction and DOOM!!!!!!","The game came in the mail, one day, I opened it up, examined it, and found it arrived in the condition promised. I've already beat the game on the first 2 difficulty levels. Pyah!!!"
4,in-f***ing-credible. a f***ing masterpice!!!,"Ok. This is probably my favorite game. Hands down. It scares the s**t out of me! My only compllaint is that the graphics arent very good on the 360, which is a little wierd. But ya. Buy it if youve got a 360 or a classic. If you dont have it its pointless having an xbox."
1,A purchase that was a REAL mistake,"The picture shown is not representative of the item I received. The terry cloth ""sheds"" every time I wash it. I've never had that happen with anything I spent this much money on. It's seams have puckered and it's just not what I would have chosen had I known the quality. Don't waste money on this one, please."
3,bathrobe,"very soft and cuddly, warm to wrap up in, but only TEA length, I had hoped for atleast mid calf, or even full length, but a good buy for the price, good quality"
3,Very Good Quality...but...,"...not so true about one size fits all as this robe does not fit around me. I have NEVER had a robe not fit me before. I can't tie it together, so, it is just left open which defeats the purpose as I try to be modest.But, the quality is TOP QUALITY material. This robe will last you a long time. It is thick and full! If you are a medium to small or small-medium framed man or lady, this is a great robe to buy. Great pricing and REALLY GREAT quality."
3,Meh,"I bought this robe after purchasing a lovely, barely-used robe from a thrift store for myself. I liked my newly purchased robe so much I thought, ""Everyone I love needs one of these!"" So, I trolled Amazon for a quality, affordable robe which I didn't quite find. It is a bit thin and not as incredibly luxurious as I would have hoped. My son, for whom I bought the robe, wears it in the mornings and it successfully keeps him warm. Meh."
5,"Great quality, fantastic price","I was a little disappointed when I took the robe out of the package but after washing and drying, the robe is perfect. It is fluffy and extremely comfortable. It is very similar to the quality of robes you find in five-star hotel rooms. The price cannot be beat. I plan on buying a few more as gifts."
4,Liveaboard Family,"Are you attracted to the cruising life, but are afraid that your family will suffer, or will not be able to follow you on your pursuit of happiness?This book takes you by the hand, and shares the experiences of a family gone cruising for the long run.Very objective, sometimes funny and witty, very informative.Maybe this book is the push you were needing to start your own life of cruising with your family."
2,Narcissist?,"Tom Neale has published a few books on sailing and I bought this with great expectations of hearing a fellow sailor's journey as no two journeys are alike. After sailing for 5 years I looked forward to kicking back and taking in some of that life through an others words. He is billed as being a good writer on the subject of sailing and world cruising so the hopes were high. I thought there would be either powerful story telling or some kind of insights into what make up a good journey. It is often difficult to explain the nuances of being out on the big blue reading about it is certainly worth the price of a book if the reading is good. In reading, I found he is most impressed with himself his boat and his abilities more than anything else. He spent so much time about him that he forgot to talk about the journey the awakening and the discovery that goes on. After two chapters I gave the book away."
4,Cute tooth fairy pillow,My daughter received a similar tooth fairy pillow and I needed to find one for my son. This pillow is perfect and can hang anywhere. Much easier for the tooth fairy.
1,Don't Waste Your Time!,"This was possibly THE worst book I have ever read in my life. Each stupid, ""eerie"" tale is just that: stupid. The stories start out good and wind around a great plot, but then just end, with no explanations. At first, I thought the authors just want to leave us guessing.... but piecing back the stories, you realize the stories don't have any explanation what so ever.I opened this book expecting great tales about ghost like or actual eerie encounters. The only thing eerie about this book is whoever enjoys reading it."
2,Don't buy if you have wireless b or g network - Not a true 5.8 phone,"I got this phone all excited to finally have a phone that would not interfere with my wireless network. Boy what a disappointment. I've since read (from secondary internet sources anyway) that lots of ""5.8 GHz"" phones also broadcast in the 2.4 GHz range. I looked in the documentation that came with the phone to see what frequencies the base station and handsets broadcasted from, and there was NOTHING on the subject. Wonderful.TO ANY MANUFACTURERES OR VENDORS READING: Don't you get it!? Many People are buying these 5.8 phones because they want a phone that won't interfere with their wireless network. Tell us straight up if this is the case or not, instead of letting us buy the phone and then return it. Headaches all around for everybody."
4,better than any other phone i've tried,"I bought this phone because my other phone was getting some bizarre interference from my dsl connection, it kept ""ghost-ringing"" (ring once and disconnect, no caller id registered on the screen) it drove me crazy! The phone company told me to try a different frequency phone, so I got this one and the ghost ringing stopped. (note: this is the nutshell version of the story--I tried different cords, different outlets, several other different frequency phones but nothing worked)It also has great reception and holds its charge better than any other phone I've owned. Its not perfect because you can accidentally hit the on-off button with your chin if you hold the phone against your shoulder, but other than that its a good, no-frills, phone."
3,Glue Like,"If your hair is even slightly moist this product really ""plasters"" it. Almost to a point that you can't get a comb through."
4,Did it's job well,I performed a pretty poor scratch repair job this past summer and I wanted to correct the horrible blemishes that my excessive use of clear coat caused on my brand new 2011 Chevy Equinox. Follow the directions closely and this sanding block will do the job well! Be gentle and take your time because it can get out of hand really quick if you are not careful.
3,"Something to ""whet"" the appetite for a dive trip","We are planning a trip to Yap & Palau, so I got this dvd for my husband for his birthday to give him an idea of what we would be seeing. It's not a life-changing, amazing, outstanding dvd but it does give you an overall impression of the 4 islands. I thought it was interesting that the island with the least amount of footage--or so it seemed to me--was Palau; surely Palau is the most popular and more famous destination?Anyway, watching the DVD did the trick--we are more psyched than ever to go!"
1,Exploring Micronesia,"Not very helpful, too much underwater life, which as a diver I love but this was not what I was hoping to find."
1,Disappointing,"For those looking for a spiritual, and authentically Catholic view of Mary, it is not here. The view is decidedly superficial, the author being unable to comprehend that faith is a wonderous mystery, not dialog from a sit-com; i.e picturing Mary asking Joseph, when they are to flee to Egypt, just where he expects to find a donkey at that time of night. What nonsense! The Mother of God isn't a snappy one-liner; she is a profound gift, as evidenced by the late John Paul II dedicating his pontificate to her, and, writing extensively of her during his 26 year tenure. For true food for thought and meditation, any of John Paul's books will satisfy."
2,"Outdated, outdated, outdated!","I used this guide when I applied to colleges six years ago.Guess what: the quotes have not changed since then! And now that I have a diploma from one of the colleges profiled in the book, I can see that some of the information (not the opinions, the information) is inaccurate and outdated. The face of a college can change a lot in six years (and who knows if the information was even fresh then?); I would use this as a jumping off point only. I have no idea if the other guides are more frequently updated; seems like a visit is the only way to tell."
2,not many schools to choose from,"I bought this book looking forward to the ""candid feedback"" from students on the schools. Instead I found a very limited number of schools that I was interested in (North Carolina), and the unique info from the student interviews was very limited. If you are just beginning your search, this might be helpful, but if you have some idea of schools you are interested in, you should make sure they are included before buying this book."
5,Very Helpful,"A few months ago I started the big ""college search."" I got this book, and it has been the biggest help in what is a pretty big deal. The Princeton Review provides helpful information about all the colleges in there. It is objective, and very useful. There are some witty quips throughout, and it is very honest about what are a colleges ups and downs. Just about everything you need to know is in this book: admissions, academics, student life, financial info... Everything is covered thoroughly, and it is easy to read. This book is definitely a good purchase."
4,A book for fans to debate,It is basically a book of DiLeo's opinions but the beauty of the book is all the fun you can have with other Bond fans comparing your opinions with his. You might disagree or agree and the discussions go on from there. In some cases I couldn't believe his picks and in others I agreed totally. In any case another Bond fan and I had a great time going through the entire book.Try it you'll like it!
1,Don't waste your money!,This was the most disorganized book I've ever read. It has no valuable or original info. I'm an Ebay novice and I know more about selling on Ebay then this author. Stay away!
1,The worst book I've ever read,"This book is poorly done and isn't worth the paper it's printed on. The number of grammatical errors and typos in the book is beyond belief. The book lacks any kind of structure and the author more or less rambles incoherently half of the time. The other half he is trying (unsuccessfully) to convince the reader that this isn't a get rich quick scheme. This book is as close as you can get to reading an infomercial. There is little in the way of useful information and all of that can be found for free on the internet (particularly on ebay). If you want a good book about selling online, get Stephen Windwalker's The Complete Guide to Bookselling At Amazon's Marketplace and Other Online Site. It deals with books, but the knowledge he relates is practical and could be applied to nearly anything besides books."
1,What a complete ripoff!!,"I have written this to the publishers: Folks - I have been reading books for a really long time, but I have never seen a sloppier book than 'the truth about ebay' - there are more spelling and grammar errors in the first 25 pages of this book than in any book of any length I have ever read. The content is completely random, with topics coming out of nowhere, with very little or no context. Then, when I get to page 94, the entire rest of the book is a list of resources?!!? I could find those on the web in about 2 minutes.I have rarely felt so ripped off...please tell me how to return this book to you or the author for a refund."
2,Save your money.,"Just bought a copy ""The Truth About Ebay"" and after 3 pages knew I had made a mistake.There is nothing new here and if you have done any buying or selling on Ebay youprobably know more about it than the author. Poorly written and poorly organized withmany glaring grammatical mistakes. Doubt that it was ever proofread. The publishershould be ashamed. He spends a lot of time warning about unscrupulous sellers.Somebody should have warned us about him."
1,The worst book ever!,"I agree with the other one-star review that this book should receive no stars. Not even a fraction of one star! Highly disappointing!!! There's absolutely no structure to this book, and too many typos and errors to count! The author obviously doesn't know the meaning or the purpose behind PROOFREADING!"
5,"Well-written, very user-friendly and filled with strategies","Our family has made a successful living selling dolls and bears at eBay for the past five years. I wish Donny's book was around when we first started! His strategies are sound, his information is invaluable and his writing style is very user-friendly. By learning and utilizing the information in this book, you can save yourself countless hours of trial and error and add more profit to your pockets. Consider this resource guide an investment in yourself that will pay for itself many times over.

4,How To Make Crazy Pictures,"The images are funny, and the techniques behind it are useful for your own creations. Click on ""Search inside this book"" to get an idea.If you plan on panoramic, stereoscopic or infrared photography:Panoramic & Stereoscopic Photography In Color And Infrared: A Step By Step Guide"
5,Very satisfied,The item was exactly what I wanted and I am very satisfied. It arrived quickly and the price was great.
3,Incorrect Info!,"This book is for Grades 3-6 and definitely is a collection of rebus puzzles, as listed, BUT, it only has 49 pages!!!! Hello?! When I bought it, I looked specifically at the number of pages and thought, Wow, that's a good deal, 6 puzzles on each page, 110 pages, that's about 660 puzzles--perfect! Well, I got it and it has less than half that. I wouldn't have bought it if I had known it was so thin. Annoying."
1,"do not use to hot surface,it melts down","i picked the egg from hot pan on first use,and melted.. -_-,,i don't think it could endure the heat,like it says."
4,Not as weak as I expected.,"These are nylon but do have a nice silicon grip so you won't easily drop them. They could use a reinforcement to make them stronger but these aren't meant to be used for heavy duty cooking, they're mainly to protect the finish on your Circulon pans which is why I bought them. For heavy-duty jobs, I have some el-cheapo metal tongs that work great - three pairs of them in fact.As for the melting, yes, like any nylon tool, direct contact with very hot surfaces will melt them.I like them for their intended use and would recommend them."
3,Nylon Tongs are not as good as metal,I bought these tongs because I have a nonstick grill. I didn't want to scratch the grill.These tongs are too weak. You cannot pickup or turn anything as large as a ear of corn. Now I have to buy stainless steel tongs that have tips on them.
2,It's crap!,"I love Calphalon pans, and own a dozen. But these tongs are basically only good for salad. They can't pick up a sausage in hot oil and turn it over. At least not without dropping said sausage in oil, splattering me with hot burning oil, and reminding me that you shouldn't fry things without a shirt on.I'll stick to using metal tongs, and just try to be careful with not scratching my pans."
2,Too much flex,"I love my collection of Calphalon's Commercial Aluminum cookware so I decided to get a pair of their nylon tongs. Unfortunately, they have proven to be very flexible at the bend and it creates problems with gripping the food.Stainless is the only way to go when it comes to tongs."
5,Exactly what I wanted!,Love them! They are exactly what I was looking for. Shipping was good and on time.
1,"Harmless, but Uninteresting","I found these stories easy to read, but there was no ""oomph"" to them. I liken it to the difference between drinking a full-bodied beer versus a light beer. Just because something goes down easy doesn't mean it tastes good."
4,Great priest album,"The first time i heard this album i didn't like it, simply because i was expecting something different. I expected something different from them. Especially since everyone kept telling how good they were and how they influenced all the bands i love now. I heard it didn't care for it then I heard Painkiller then i fell in love with judas priest! went back to this one to give it one more shot and fell in love with it!!! took me a while but won't make that mistake again.Love every song on here except ""United"". i just don't like this Stadium type of songs!Stand outs would have to be ""Rapid fire"" ""The rage"" ""Steeler"". Absolutely love this songs!!"
4,JUDAS PRIEST POUND THE WORLD LIKE A BATTERING RAM WITH BRITISH STEEL!!,"judas priest released british steel in 1980.i remember at the time[in 1980], hearing on the radio a rumour that the master tapes for britsh steel were stolen at the time.however all rumours aside british steel is a great album from priest and a good follow up to unleashed in the east which was released in 1979 and was their first live album.before recording began on british steel judas priest hired drummer dave holland to replace les binks.dave holland stayed with priest until 1989.british steel has many great classic priest songs on it many of which are still played today.for me the best cuts are,rapid fire,metal gods,living after midnight,breaking the law,the rage and steeler.the bonus are interesting too.if you want one of judas priest,s finest albums this is a good choice for the collection!"
4,great remaster,"This classic sounds a lot better now, the track listing is this way everywhere else in the world, only the american version started off with ""Breaking The Law"". I like the remastered track listing better!!!"
3,Beginning Of A Downturn,"When it comes to the remasters,I'll pass from this point on when it comes to Priest. British Steel was the beginning of the band's turn to commercialism and simplifying their music. Gone were the tricky rhythm changes of masterpiecies like ""Victim Of Changes"", and ""Sinner"", as well as any quiet acoustic textures that varied their attack.Radio ready shout alongs like ""Breakin' The Law"" (""Washin' The Dog""-Beavis And Butthead version),""Livin' After Midnight"", and the ever moronic ""United"" took their place. The pre-sped metaler ""Rapid Fire"", and the surprising ""Don't Have To Be Old To Be Wise"", and ""Steeler"" recall a better time (Stained Class)and partially save this one;but folks,please get Sad Wings Of Destiny, and Sin After Sin first if you really want to appreciate this band."
2,A Mediocre Hard Rock Album - Not Judas Priest's Best,"If you were to put together a list of Judas Preist's best 5 albums, British Steel would definitely NOT be on that list. The songs on this album lack the dynamic musical talent you find on their earlier or later albums, such as Stained Class or Painkiller. The album itself seems far too contrived and comes off sounding bland to my ears. This album doesn't really showcase Judas Priest's talent.If you're a new listener to Judas Priest, then I would avoid starting out with this album, otherwise you might be turned off from them altogether! Check out their other albums from my list below (in no particular order):-Painkiller-Defenders of the Faith-Stained Class-Sad Wings of Destiny-Sin After Sin-Screaming for Vengeance"
4,Unstoppable priest!,"Priest Just keep releasing great albums. British steel is another gem, though i find it hard to give this one 5 stars with the likes of breaking the law, living after midnight, and the poor mans Queen like anthem ""united"". not like those songs are horrible, but they're not vintage either. The vintage priest songs here are rapid fire, metal gods, grinder and ""the rage"". Once again, priest delivers the goods!"
5,Another Heavy Metal Classic for the ages!!,"Ever single song on here is excellent. This is one of those well thought out albums where there is no ""filler"" songs. I've always liked, Judas Priest. They have always made good music, except for, Turbo, which was their attempt at finding a mainstream audience. British Steel is iconic in the sense that this album is like the essence of the NWOBHM (New Wave of British Heavy Metal)movement. Their is a certain working class, raw and edgy sound from the early NWOBHM bands. Not only that, but the album cover art fits this cd well. It's made from metal, and very sharp. It's dangerous and powerful. It's not meant for some boy band douchebag to listen to. It's made for working class people, who feel left out/abandoned/or isolated in some way. From beginning to end, this cd packs a musical punch. K.k. Downing, and Glen Tipton are superb in their twin guitar attack. Rob Halford is stellar, too. Long live the metal gods, Judas Priest."
3,Overrated Priest album,"I know that this is supposed to be a real classic, but I've never really got into this cd. I absolutely hate the song ""Breaking The Law"", because it's so repetitive and juvenile. They weren't really doing metal to much on this album, because the song ""Living After Midnight"" is just a regular rock anthem, not heavy metal. I guess this might be up some of your customers alleys, but this is about the only pre 1985 Priest album that I've never bought, and I don't see myself buying this any time soon, but maybe I will when hell freezes over. If you like Priest that is kind of lame, then this is perfect for you."
5,A Great But A Sellout Album But For The Most Part,"Don't get me wrong this is a very fun album from Judas but gone are the days of the real Judas Priest with classics like Sad Wings Of Destiny(The best real Priest album),Sin After Sin(Great album that one!!!),and Stained Class.This album along with Hellbent For Leather were clear sellout albums but they still rock but I don't know about Hellbent(because I don't own it).After Stained Class THE REAL JUDAS PRIEST dissapeared.This album isn't as serious as their 70's classics(THE REAL PRIEST),but it is still very good and really fun.Don't take this one serious,just listen to it and have fun.Gone are the days of Dreamer Deceiver,Dissident Aggressor,Beyond The Realms Of Death(The Very Best Songs from the band)."
5,An essential hard rock/heavy metal album.,"Judas Priest has never released a bad cd. In fact, they are one of the greatest metal bands of all time, and one of the first. British Steel has to be one the best album ever done by these guys. Dave Holland's drum playing is excellecnt, and K.K. Downings and Glen Tipton's guitar playing is legendary. Ian Hill is a good bass player whose playing can actually be heard. Halford's vocal's are absolutely badass. You really need to look into this."
5,Classic!,"This is album is a timeless classic. This is my favorite Judas Priest album, and I personally consider it their best release. No where else can one find traditional heavy metal of the late 70's/early 80's era that stands out with great superiority.""Rapid Fire"" kicks the album off to a roaring start. ""Metal Gods"" is a slow-paced rocker that has an interesting bridge. ""Breaking the Law"" is a radio stable, as is ""Living After Midnight."" ""Grinder"" could have used better lyrics, but the guitar work by Downing and Tipton make up for it. Adding to their collection of rock anthems is ""United."" Any classic metal fan would love this album. This is classic Priest at its best. A top production."
3,British Steel is OVER-RATED!,"I've always heard people, for some reason, praising this c.d., and I feel it's time to give my opinionated opinion. It's OVER-RATED! (The c.d.- not my opinion). Don't get me wrong, British Steel has it's good points. Tom Allom does a surprisingly good job with the production. Also, there are some good head-banging riffs. Just listen to ""Grinder"", ""Living After Midnight"", and ""Breakin' the you-know-what"". But after hearing Stained Class and Hell Bent for Leather, British Steel just doesn't compare. It's more like a retrogression. It's evident in the drumming dept. (What ever happened to Les Binks)? And it's definately noticable in the lyrics. (Well, that was noticable in some of Hell Bent). It's a must have for any Priest fan, but choose Screaming, Defenders, Stained Class, or Hell Bent before British Steel. Oh yeah, does ""United"" sound like a high school graduation song, or is it just me?"
1,Kindergarten Metal.,"Good God, Metal doesn't get any more sterile than this. What do people see in this crap anyway? The riffs are uninventive, the song structures are unimaginative and the drumming sucks. This album might sound ""killer"" to someone who's either been listening to Metal for about a day or is just incredibly stubborn. For those of you who haven't been living under a rock though, don't bother."
1,umm....,"I wouldnt waste my money on this, the picture isnt even of 2pac, this is a definite buyer beware situation."
5,mind-boggling,"Bellydancers looking for a change of pace from the traditional orchestral numbers should definitely check this out. Click on the sample of track #4 for the fastest, most surfer-psychedelic karshilama you can imagine. Many of these songs have traditional Turkish rhythms, and make a wonderful change from the ubiquitous techno-Arabic pop. The cover of the album says ""vol. 1"" and I hope there are many, many more to come!"
5,Lo Fi and insanely good,"I liked this Turkish psyche comp better than the Turkish ""Love Peace & Poetry"" comp. It's more interesting. Some of it sounds like Black Sabbath with Belly dance breaks. Some of it sounds like Selda's first album. Theres even a killer Moog sounding cut. The sound quality is lo-fi: it sounds like you're playing old vinyl - but I like that...I wish Dionysus would rock more intl. psyche comps. they have awesome taste.P.S. Im not sure I would recommend it to a belly dancer unless theyre a hippie."
2,"Great Show, not the whole season","My son loves this show, and I like the message. The animation is amazing. The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that Season 1 is something like 24 episodes. They give you 5 and call it Season 1. ""Season 2"" is actually just the next 5 episodes of Season 1."
3,nice album but one problem,da problem is dat track 3 and 5 are suposely supose b singing wit duets and and da preview section it shows wit otha singers bt wen i bought download the tracks through amazon mp3 those two songs were not like the album is feature and i think that amazon should not charge for those tracks cuz dat nott fair
3,ashley was a walking art cult,"this book made me think of claudia getting caught up in a cult about art which was how the new girl ashley acted, and she was forgetting her priorities and letting her friend control and pressure her to devote her life to art and all this strange stuff but in the end claudia gets back to reality"
4,Claudia and a weirdo,A new girl called Ashley is in Claud's neighbourhood and she is one awful little weirdy thing.She makes friends with Claudia and demands that Claudia be JUST like her and that she stays away from her other friends!!Ashley is extremely eccentric and nasty and is obsessed with fire hydrants.
2,someone could really get burned,"this works okay about half the time, for me anyway. I use disposable bottles which this is supposed to be compatable with. It seems that the bottles are usually not warm enough or hot enough to really scald someone. I don't recommend this. I usually just warm water in a cup and warm the bottles that way. I feel bad that someone spent money on this for us."
2,Always makes bottles too hot,We bought this bottle warmer two weeks ago because our little one recently switched to formula and we thought maybe we would keep this in his room to make night time feedings easier. We've tried it several different times during the day and every time the bottle come out scalding hot and we have to soak them in cold water to make them drinkable for our little boy! I guess we'll just go back to heating his bottles in hot water in the sink! Way more trouble than it's worth!
4,Pretty good!,"This is actually pretty good! I use it for warming breastmilk & formula. It took a few tries to get it perfect temperature, but I have never had too-hot milk, so my baby didn't get hurt. There were a few times where the milk wasn't too warm - but didn't take long. My measuring cup's markings did rub off after 2 months, and I contacted Munchkin and they sent me a new one for free."
2,"It's ok, but...","This bottle warmer is OK. It is difficult to figure out how much water to use to get the correct temperature if you are heating less than 4 ounces. Also, it does get that gross brown stuff on the inside and all over the base - which is hard to clean up. My husband is still battling with it - I am staring to use a cup of hot water more often now. But, for the price I guess it's not a bad deal. It should be better when we routinely need to heat more."
2,Not that impressed,"So far, I am not too impressed with this warmer. Using the exact amount of water suggested with the level, I find that the Avent 4-oz bottle of breast milk is still COLD. However, scalding water drips off the bottle as I pull it out of the warmer (be careful not to burn yourself!). I plan on trying different amounts of water to see if I can get the right ratio - but for something that is supposed to be a help, it is just creating more work for me...thankfully, Peanut doesn't mind his milk a little on the cold side."
1,This thing is horrid!,"I'm currently in the process of adopting my son, and I bought this to take to Guatemala with me when I visited. It never worked - it didn't matter how much water I put in the chamber, it would never cycle on more more than 30 seconds. I then had to wait approximately 5 minutes for it to cool back down before using it for another 30 second cycle. I ended up filling the ice bucket with hot water, and letting the bottle sit in that to warm up.Needless to say, it's been sent back. I think I'll just use the microwave when the baby gets home - it's got to be easier and quicker than this thing."
5,Wonderful !!!,"We purchased this before our little one arrived and soon after she was born we were using this...it has been great...yes, you do have to sorta fiddle with what water amount is best for the type of bottle and the amount of fluid you are trying to heat...but, for us it has never been too much of an issue. I am so thrilled I purchased this one as I have tried many others w/ our 1st daughter and didn't like many of them."
2,Won't shut off after just a handful of uses!,"We bought this on a Saturday... we used it for the first time on Sunday morning. We only used it, maybe 2-3 times per day. We unplugged it after each use. Went to warm up a bottle on Wednesday evening and the switch glows red permanently now, which means it does not beep or turn off. We haven't touched it since then... it technically still works, but not properly. I'm ticked, because we didn't use this much at all and were very careful with it, yet it still died out on us.My daughter prefers her bottles warmed, so we are going to invest in another warmer, but so far, not sure on the brand... especially since this one was ""highly"" recommended."
4,Great Item Reasonable Price,"Works beautifully and didn't cost an arm and a leg. Looks great and takes up less counter or dresser-top space than others we looked at, too.Will work with Avent, Playtex, Medela and Evenflo bottles. Those are the only ones we've tried so far; we are trying to get our breastfed baby to accept an occasional bottle after I express and store/refrigerate my milk and so far haven't found the right bottle and nipple combo he likes, but will keep trying!Warms evenly, once you figure out the right water amount for the type of bottle. Never leave the bottle in longer than the instructions recommend--the package insert warns against this practice and says it will make the temperature hotter the longer you leave the bottle in. A beeping sound tells you when the bottle is warm.Has an on/off switch and auto shut-off safety feature."
3,Celebration,"The photographs are beautiful and the little stories are interesting. The book is determinedly up- beat, almost to a fault, but the author's desire to present the best side of these children is understandable. She makes clear the fact that Down Syndrome children and adults are capable of so much , especially with the help of a good education and the understanding of the community. My major criticism is that the text and the photographs were totally unrelated."
1,terrible,terrible knife and is hard to flip out. bad blade wobble and plastic handle that will break very easy.i dont recomend buying
3,SPY GIRL,"IT WAS A CUTE COMEDY - BEST THING ABOUT THIS MOVIE WAS MY FAVORITE ACTOR, GONG YOO, WHO WAS ALSO IN COFFEE PRINCE."
2,childish,I purchased this dvd to brush up on my Korean. I guess it did help me with that. Unfortunately it was childish and lacked any substance.
5,One of a kind!,"I have loved all of the Celebrate Series compilations, but the Passover Lounge breaks new ground. It is creative and bold music the redefines the Passover experience. Get it...and, you'll get it!"
2,"Not so lounge-y, not so hot","Good intentions, but fairly bland results. Take the title with a large grain of salt. This is not lounge music - by any definition - for the most part. Indeed, several tracks tend toward bland soft rock, including the usually boisterous Passover favortie ""Dayenu''; the version here is a curiousity just because it's so laid back. Children's entertainer Taubman's voice, heard on several but not all tracks, may be the weakest element."
3,Poor quality control of the drafting board...,"The kit comes with all you see. Quality of the parts are acceptable, except for the board. The board is likely particle board, so it will break with rough handling. The two lateral edges are lined with steel band for a smooth surface. The top and bottom edges are lined with a plastic wood grained vinyl.Unfortunately, the plastic wood grained vinyl edges were not sanded down evenly, and stuck out by about 1/8 inch on on side of the table. When trying to use the T square, the tip of the vinyl piece extended beyond the steel edge, and caused the T square to jump and not be squared.Trimming with a razor took care of the raised edge - but should have been done at the factory and not by the consumer. Light sanding could have fixed it too, but at the risk of sanding the board if you are not careful.Better quality control will be needed at the factory. Hopefully, Alvin will read this note."
1,Where's the beef??,I ordered this item from amazon also. They told me I had to contact the company directly as they did not get a delivery confirmation. Amazon says I can't cancel my order and I have not heard back from the vendor. Amazon ought to look into this company to see if they are worthy of their business. I will update if I ever get the product.
1,Have not received the item yet.,"Hi, I will like to request a delivery confirmation of the item ""Alvin CP900 Drawing Kit with Black Case"" to the address that I submitted. Until to day November 26 I still have not received my item.Please advice for the future actions."
1,Very noisey!,"I puchased this hard drive for a Dell Latitude D410 .It was very loud when it is reading/writing. Its very quiet while it idles but when it reads or writes it makes a very loud clicking noise. It almost sounds broken but it seems to work okay. I would not purchase this hard drive, pay the couple extra bucks and buy something nicer and quiter."
4,Good Korean War Novel,"Crawford draws on his own personal experience in Korea to turn out a really good novel of Marines at war. The main character, ""Cautious"", is a FO (forward observer) on the main line of resistance with regular Marine grunts directing the fire of his 4.2 inch heavy mortars in the rear. (Hence the name of the book.) He was there from 1951-1952 when the war had settled down into a WWI-like trench war when both sides dug in to hold their ground and sniped at each other. Most of the book takes place in the Eastern Front area of the Punchbowl. He later goes to the Western Front at a place nicknamed Bunker Hill, again as a FO. There is one chilling Chinese human wave assault near the end of the book, where the Marines hold on but just barely and at an enormous cost.He has a lot of true-to-life wacky characters in his book like the Funny Gunny, Lt. Les Able, Red and a crack shot called the Candy Bar Kid that really make it believeable. Definitely one of my favorite Korean War novels."
2,"Health, wealth and prosperity with a little ""gospel""","I'm astounded at how many are so easily swayed by this new emerging movement of ""self-help"" positivism that has come the way of infomercials, cheaply arranged seminars, and self-published manuals. As I giggle with incredulity, I see profiteers continuing on their way, preying on the undiscerning, feeble-minded, anti-intellectual.obviously, there's a market, and the market responds. Such is the life and journey of this book -- recycled principles from self help guides, common sense ethics from the Book of Proverbs, and a touch of inspiration/perspiration sloganeering. The tragedy, though, is the debasing of Biblical theology and disorderly exegesis (if you can even call it that). God help those who put down the $10-$15 for these. I think I'll hit Applebee's and read the Times instead.oh, and TWO stars instead of one because everybody deserves a little grace."
3,okay book by itself... but it would AWESOME as a workbook,"Hey,Anyone who is a christian, or listens to christian radio in New York is familiar with 570 WMCA. I think the book is good, but it is obvious it was written in ten days. As far as business books go, I think this one is okay. HOWEVER, it would be awesome if his publishing company made available the REBUILDING FROM GROUND ZERO seminar on tape with the book redone as a workbook. I shelled out eighty dollars for a Les Brown package. I heard Seni on the radio and he is SO inspiring.Sincerely,Renee"
4,Excellent pre and post retirement planning information.,"This guide provides excellent pre-retirement planning suggestions. Has traps, obstacles and helpers outlined for quick review and advice. Has a number of ""tools"" in the form of worksheets to assist in planning for both before and after retirement events. Presents a number of post-retirement ideas with several suggestions of how to manage and/or increase your income in retirement. Authors are somewhat short on information for the mid 50's retiree concerning how to access 401k and IRA funds without penalty between 55 and 59 1/2. No info on what forms are needed and where they are available, or what needs to be filed and where. Has one slight reference in the appendix on how to accomplish withdrawals without penalty. Having read a number of retirement planning books available on the bookshelf, I found this volume excels in providing useful information not found in similar guide books."
1,Piece of Junk,"This unit and most of Frigidaire's Air Conditioners are junk. We bought one at Lowe's and said, ""Wow what a Deal"". Brought it home and put it in the window. It started up, and then the compressor kicked in after 3 minutes. So far so good. Then the 20 Amp circuit it is on blows. We reset and restarted. Now the compressor does not start. We try it in another 20 Amp circuit. Same thing, my little Lasko fan was better than this. Tried everything stated on forums and in manual. Nothing. Seems like it was the compressor that shorted out. Brought it back to Lowes. At the return counter there is 7 other Frigidaire Air Conditioners, all brought in on the same day according to the lady at the counter. She rolled her eyes and as if to say, ""Oh no another Frigidaire"". Gave us our money back no questions. Went to PC Richards, and bought a Friedrich for a bit more, but cools very nicely."
1,TRASH DONT DO IT TO YOURSELF!,"THIS PIECE OF (BLANK) COULDNT COOL A PHONE BOOTH! STRAIGHT JUNK! THE COLDEST TEMPATURE FEELS LIKE MY OLD AC ON LOW FAN, YOU WOULD BE BETTER OFF USING AN CHURCH FAN AND FAN YOURSELF WITH YOUR HAND I STAND RIGHT IN FRONT OF THIS CRAP AND STILL NO COOL AIR. BUY A REAL AC OR GET A FAN FOR (...) ANYTHING BEATS THIS JUNK!!!!HOT AND DISGUSTED"
5,Founder of Butt Trumpet here!,"I have always been proud of Bianca. As the founder of her first band, ""Butt Trumpet"" as well as someone who loves her very much, I can only say that I am grateful that she was able to document herself more fully with Betty Blowtorch than I was able to muster in Butt Trumpet due to stupid disputes that slowed down our ability to put out more records (at the time). If you're a fan of true, from the heart rock-n-roll, look no further than Bianca and her band, Betty Blowtorch! I'm here to tell you, Bianca was for real. And even in death, she still has an amazing power over people. Make no mistake, Bianca is a legend. Any Betty recording you can get your hands on, grab it, savor it, because there's much to learn from listening to it. It's how rock-n-roll is supposed to be made!R.I.P. Bianca.Thom BoneButt Trumpet"
5,joe UK,"One of the best rock albums I've heard in years, it really make the hairs on the back on you neck stand up, its got so much energy it blows you away. If you like your punk/ rock/ hardcore get this album, its great fun. You wont get a better example of this type of music anywhere. You could say its a cross between L7 and Motley Crue but its got a sound all of its own as stands up easily against either of the forementioned bands."
3,Well written but a tad dry,"I found ""The Fires of Autumn"" to be a very well researched book that I thought to be somehow lacking when portraying the human drama of the event. A goodly portion of the book, more than I thought was warrented, is devoted to the court battles that sprung from the fires and I think more space could and should have been devoted to dealing with the actual fire itself. After reading the excellent ""Under a Flaming Sky"" concerning the Hinkley Fire I found this book to be very dry and lacking in color."
4,Missing something,"As one of Renee's many rabid supporters, I was excited to see that this film was available. So excited, in fact, that I somehow ordered two copies of it. On one hand, it is a great look at Ms Fleming's career, how she handles life as a mom and a world-famous artist, and has some interesting biographical details. But somehow Tony Palmer was able to take such a great artist and make a boring film out of her. The shining moments are clips from rehearsals, where the viewer can see how music affects her, both to tears and to laughter.The most valuable portions of the DVD are when she sings, and my favorite part is Korngold's aria at the end. But some things were left out that would have been great to see; for example, we see footage of her walking on stage as a young competition winner to sing Dvorak, but they break away to a clip of her singing it today, in a similar dress.The vignettes are also nice. Overall, a good buy if you love Renee. Otherwise, don't bother."
4,What more could you ask for!,"This is just a dream! All that a Renee Fleming fan could ask for. This has so much video footage -- the footage that you missed and the footage that you didn't even know existed. There's footage of her singing ""You'll Never Walk Alone"" from Carousel, ""Amazing Grace"" (from Ground Zero), Desdemona's final scene in Otello (a live Opera performance), duets with Pavarotti, Domingo and oh so much more!! If you thought listening to her was the best this world has to offer, you have no idea where SEEING her will take you! Believe it or not, her recordings are not the best she has to offer -- you just wouldn't believe how much soul she emits in live performance.However, many of the interviews could have been shaved down (Many were filled with uninteresting dialogue or subject matter). I also would have really liked a good section to be dedicated to a biographical timeline.Again, this is just a Renee Fleming finatic's dream!!! Buy! Buy! Buy!"
2,big disappointment,"I was really disapointed with this film about Renée Fleming. She deserved a much better film. This one is not well done, the sequence of images is almost non sense and the whole thing is quite boring. Even most of the arias (or parts of arias as Renee is not showed singing any full aria at all!) are almost painful to see (you better close your eyes!) because they seem to be sung in play back.I have seen Renée Fleming live, I've listened to many recordings of her and always enjoyed a lot. Unfortunately this time that was not the case."
1,Made me laugh...at what a sucker I am,"I've never seen Fleming live and after enduring this horrible DVD, I don't ever plan to in the future. Let me blunt, this horror flick is non-stop torture from beginning to end. It starts with her singing with the muppets and steadily gets worse.If content such as Hugging the Clintons, The Preperation of a special desert from some fruitcake chef, endless dull rehearsals, and an incredibly tacky 911 tribute is up your alley then by all means buy this embarrassing informercial. If you're looking for real content such as opera clips, etc. then you're SOL. In fact, I found it so offensive that I am now an ex-fan."
3,A little more information please...,"I am an extreme fan of Fleming and couldn't wait to find out more about her than I already knew in this DVD. However, I was able to see and hear a bunch of clips of CDs that I already own. It was great to see some of it live, but there was only about 10 seconds of each clip, but about 10 minutes of her rehearsing for the Verdi Requiem. Some questions that I would have liked answered were, who was/is her inspiration? When did she know she wanted to be a professional singer? Where all has she studied? What is her favorite role? With whom does she love to work? There could have been numerous questions answered. I also would have loved to see clips of her as a young singer and also in many different stages in her career. I also think that the film was boring at times and very choppy. I was extremely dissapointed with this DVD, but I still had to give it 3 stars because it is Renee Fleming after all. I am still a huge fan despite this poor DVD."
2,Try another NIKON,"Three weeks after i bought it, the flash did not work.I was surprised beacuse is a NIKON, but I recommend you to try another model of same brand."
2,Does not turn on with Memory Card In,"I bought this camera about 2 years ago and after about a month, the camera wouldn't turn on if it had a memory card in it. I have to take it out, then turn it on, then re-insert the card. The card is approved for the camera. Hopefully this has been fixed in later camera shipments. If you start to have this problem, get it fixed under warranty, else it might make you wish you bought something else."
5,Great pictures!,This camera is great! Purchased for a 12 year old....very easy to use and takes great pictures...very user friendly as far as downloading pics to pc or mac.Would recommend this camera for anyone.Bought a second one off ebay for an 8 year old.
3,A little disappointing,"Granted it is small which is why I bought it in the first place. However, the flash takes too long to recharge in between pics and if I want to view the pic I had just taken, it takes awhile for the screen to pop up. Also, the flash is way too bright... Instead of flashing ONCE like most cameras, it flashes 3 times and can momentarily blind you if you are not used to it. You can also forget taking pictures without the flash... Every time I try, the blur warning pops up even though I take great care not to move while taking a picture. The only good thing about it is the size and the battery life is pretty long."
2,Eats Up Batteries ...,The optics are not too bad. This little unit will do the basics.The panorama feature does not work since each image is slightly distorted.It uses two double A batteries and for some reason the camera sucks up a lot of power. I've had to go through batteries like water through a pipe.
2,"Not worth, bad image quality","This is a cheap camera in 4 MP and can cost around $100. This is an attractive price, but the image quality is so terrible that this camera is not worth. I have used 5 other digital cameras (mostly Olympus & 1 Canon) and I am a hobby photographer (landscapes & cityscapes). This camera features are not useful at all and any pictures taken inside rooms or party modes were shaky and blurred. Its museum mode works good. I have been fighting with this camera for last 5 months, and theneventually stopped using it.Its flash charging time is too long and you have to wait to see a picture after taking it.There is a long time gap & effort in clicking, holding the click button and whole camera firmly while taking pictures.Pros:Small, Easy-to-navigate Menu, Lot of picture modesCons:Terrible picture quality, No image stabilizing, Modes are not effective"
3,"OK for still photos, but...","The camera is so slow that a child, pet, or other subject who doesn't understand, ""Stay still for 2-3 seconds and smile..."", will no longer be in the shot. So, I'm giving it to my 9 year-old grandson who says he doesn't mind that problem. Have purchased a Canon PowerShot and am WAY happier!"
1,Don't Bother,"Looking from the other reviews on this page I might have just gotten a lemon but I hate my Nikon. I had a Nikon Coolpix 3100 forever. It lasted through falls and four years of constant picture taking. SO when I wore it out I knew I wanted another Nikon. I regret it now. I have had to take it back to BestBuy 3 times now to get the lense fixed. The lense refuses to open and after they have fixed it, it will work for two days then stop again and this is with it not falling or anything like that. Also it eats through batteries, it is slow in letting you take another picture. The only good thing about it is the user interface."
3,Nikon coolpix l4,The Nikon coolpix l4 camera I purchased here on Amazon came to me damaged in transit.but the seller and or amazon corrected the situation for me.I have since then purchase this nikon coolpix L4 elsewhere.For an older camera I must say it does take nice pics for a 4mp camera.It small and so easy to carry in your pocket. its a simple camera to operate not alot of knobs to worry about its a very automatic camera.I have gotten several complements on the photos from this camera.So if you are in the market for an older camera maybe for you or a youngster to learn digital photography on.You might check this one out.One other nice thing is it takes standard AA batteries so you dont have to worry about finding the appropriate camera battery for it and the battery life on mine is quite decent.
5,Great digital camera,"This is a great camera, and very easy to use. I love it . Has video features too, the newer model has soubd to record also."
3,Good Camera,"I bought this camera about 2 years ago around christmas, and i haven't had any trouble. It works well, and doesn't have many problems. It doesn't break super easily cause i droped it several times (although my sister has a L10, she dropped it once and it spilt in 2). My only complaints are:a. No audio on video modeb. Takes a while to adjust its self in between picturesc. Takes a while to actually take a pictured. Hard to get a pretty close up shot of something with out it being blurryIm thinking about upgrading this year, but ill probably just stick with this one for a while."
4,This Camera is Great!!,"This is my first real digital camera, and I was able to use it right out of the box, transfer pictures to the computer and upload a few on my website. I was very nervous about using a digital camera with too many features and too many buttons, and I was so pleased that this one was easy to use. I have bifocals, so the 2 inch screen is working well for me, its one of the reasons I chose this model, I don't want to have to take off my glasses to see a tiny screen. The only reason I didn't give it five stars was - as another reviewer stated, Nikon didn't provide a case to protect it. Of course, I've only had it 24 hours, so I'll let you know if anything happens, but I feel confident I made the right choice in the Nikon L4."
3,Chain Not so Good...,The pendant itself was nice but it broke from the chain it came on pretty easily. It did arrive on time & as pictured so I would still buy from this seller again.
4,Better than expected,"My grandson and I shopped for a gorilla costume for a long time but could not find anything that looked real unless you spent over $100, which I was not going to do for one day. We came upon this costume and settled for it at half the price. To our surprise, it was very nice.The only reason I gave 4 stars was because it was ripped under the arm."
3,Says for Child but made for Adult,Got the costume and it was suppose to be for a child but the costume was made for an adult. It was way too big and my son couldn't wear it. Ended up sending it back to the seller.
3,gorilla costume,"This costume was great looking, but the costume itself was like it was two different sizes! I ordered it for my 4 year old son to wear for halloween and the suit part fit but the mask and gloves fit my husband who is 6ft 3in tall! So we had to do some adjustments and he still couldn't wear the gorilla gloves because there was no way to fix them. Kind of disappointed when I paid $60 for it. I would not recommend buying this for a small child. Btw I ordered a Sm size 6-7 which is the size my son wears in everything else."
1,eh...,"Non-remarkable. Plastic is old-school brittle Chinese rubbish. NOT a durable item. Looks like they changed the ""bread board"" type inputs to probe - a good thing. The manual is rubbish, horrible translation. The zipper on the case broke before I got the meter out. I returned it."
2,Meh,"Bottom of wig is not curled when you get it. I tried curling it and it didn't work too well. I ended up cutting it into a bob style. Had I left it long, it would have been a hot mess."
5,Best Hebrew Learner Text Out There!,"This book provides a step by step guide for learning Hebrew in a fun way. It is extremely well designed and planned, and was clearly written by someone who is an expert in foreign language instruction, and who also knows how to get learners excited about modern Hebrew. I recommend this book to anybody who wants to learn or teach Hebrew without any reservation. But it! You will learn a lot and fun discovering Israeli culture and Judaism too."
3,Hebrew,The information is quite good and taught well. The problem is that the book is way too big. It should be several smaller books. I can hardly hold it to study from it.
3,"nice company, yet CD missing","I had a good response from this company, yet they sent me a language book labeled in good condition without the audio CD. I see that they now say ""no audio CD,"" yet my issue is that the item was $35 and they only offered me a 10% discount for the fact that I was upset about it being listed in ""good"" condition. It seems like when these things happen, there should be more of an offer off of the item or the item should truly be listed as ""fair."""

5,Awesome Pop-a-Plate,"Saw this at my brother's and knew we had to have one. No more digging in a drawer for paper plates. They sit attached to the bottom of a shelf, out of sight, in the appliance garage and are always readily available. Be sure to bend the stack in a couple directions before putting them in the Pop-a-Plate holder so that the plates are available one at a time. The shipping was as much as the product, but all told, it was under $12, and well worth it for us."
3,"Works okay, could be better.","If you shuffle your tightly packed paper plates before putting them in this device, it works better. Sometimes the part holding up the plates comes loose if you don't pull the plates out in a straight downward motion. (If this part were stronger, it would definitely help.) It takes some practice to get it exactly right."
1,size matters,"What good is it to sell a product that I want, if you can not get the items that go with it.I have a 9 inch holder now, but both Kroger and Publix seem to only have 8.5 and 10 inch plates. The holder I have is at least ten years old, so I thought I would need to buy a new one, but it seems I am wrong.Your manufacturer needs to do some product reviews in the stores that sell the plates."
5,Pop a Plate,This is my favorite thing in my kitchen! I use Dixie brand paper plates with it and they seem to do the best! I bought this for a friend because she talked about it all the time when she came over so I bought her one for her birthday! My mom and sister have one and they love theirs too!! It comes in very handy if you have kids that are a little too short to reach the top cabinets! No more climbing on counters to get a plate for them! :o) Love this product!!!
5,Great product!,"You can't blame this product if you can't find the plates to fit it. Fortunately, we don't seem to have any trouble finding plates that fit! :)We mounted this inside of our plate cabinet, under the shelf in there. The pile of plastic plates we carry was only a couple of inches high and allowed this to be mounted above them so they are hidden from view unless the cabinet door is open.It works great and seems plenty sturdy. We load it up with paper plates (not foam, think of the environment!!) and away we go!"
4,Don't use the double sided tape,"The included tape failed within days, much like the other similar items. However once siliconed in place, it has worked flawlessly, and seems to work best with the extra-cheap plates, which is fine by me."
4,Beautiful chairs,"Chairs are very attractive and sturdier than any of the parson style chairs that I looked at in stores. Don't let the ""red"" scare you - they are more tan than red."
2,Clock had flaws,"The crystal is very nice, but the clockworks are cheaper than cheap. The front clear face is plastic as is the rim, which would have been acceptable, but the rim and face would not stick on or snap in place and it continued to fall off. I used some sticky stuff (museum gum) to hold it on, kind of. I will not return it because the postage is too steep. won't buy from Beall's again. This clock is cheap Chinese junk.This is the second time I have written a review. Don't ask again. This mchdse is not a good product for Amazon to promote."
1,Don't waste your money,"RCA knows that there are 50,000 hard core Dolly fans who willbuy anything that is released. So there's no incentive for themto reissue anything other than the standard 6 hits andoccasional filler."
5,The best advanced undergraduate quantum text book,"In my oponion this book is one of the best books about quantum mechancis. It has very good explanations and clear expression. I have studied several books about quantum mechanics such as Gasiorowics, Liboff and Ohanian but this book is the best one."
1,NOT made in the USA,"""double"" diamond hone. Well, its not double anything its one sided. Blurb says says made in USA - product is stamped made in China. I am not ready to trust a Chinese diamond for any purpose at all. Sad sale from Amazon."
3,horrible formatting!,"i had to read this book for a persian literature class this semester, and while i fell in love with the writing style and the subject matter, the kindle formatting for this book is terrible! it's all broken up into sections of just a few lines, some with gigantic font, some with microscopic font. and i couldn't figure out a way to make it all universally one size font. there was also no way to search in the text, i was only given the option to zoom when i scrolled over it. and the footnotes were at the very end of the book, past the point when they would have been useful.a great read, but the formatting is just awful. i expected better!"
5,Absolutely Incredible Life and Death Stories,"History Channel: Shockwave - Complete Season OneWe happened to catch this program on the history channel and it was all about incredible events that put man in mortal danger and the rescue operation that followed. Each event, some planned, others obviously unplanned were filmed and put together with the story line in a most gripping manner. To further clarify the incredible events unfolding before our eyes, there are clear computerized images.All together, Shockwave by the History Channel, is put together exceptionally well and is a suspense drama with real people whose lives are on the brink of death. The narration is clear and to the point. The amazing photography and filming makes you part of the event and you find yourself hoping each one will survive what appears to be the impossible. I would recommend for any age."
3,Old footage,"Most of these events featured in this set took place throughout the 80's and early 90's. The footage is real, however it is old."
3,This volume was okay.,"I feel like the producers ran out of ideas on this volume because the other volumes seem better and this one had a lot of episodes where they just added a few more scenes but had the same storylines. This voulme wasn't as great as the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd ones, but it's PINK PANTHER and I love him so I will still say that this DVD was good. =) So basically, it isn't too good but it isn't too bad ...(just in the middle). I recommend this for Pink Panher lovers all around."
2,Pink Panther Burnout,I bought this for my eight year daughter. She had really enjoyed the previous Pink Panther collections. She watched it once and hasn't watched it again. This after watching the previous collections for hours at a time. So I would judge this collection wasn't as funny as the previous collections or maybe she just got Pink Panther burnout.
5,Pink is GREAT,The kids LOVE Pink Panther and I have slowly been purchasing the video's. It is great when our 2 year old in the car starts giggling at the humor of just the stuff that happens. It a great video with an assortment and they just Love it when its on.
5,Great fun...,"The Pink Panther Classic Cartoon Collection, a set of 5 DVDs, is a must for PP fans. The cartoons are timeless and humorous on various levels, which makes the collection fun for adults as well as kids. My 8-year-old laughs every time she watches them, despite the mood she was in before turning on the player. And admittedly, so do I."
5,"Way too cool, man.",If you're a fan of gangster films this DVD deserves a spot in your collection. It helps if you understand a bit of Japanese culture and that's not a must. Highly recommended.
1,Make Doll Shoes,This book is fairly useless unless you have a larger doll to make for and I was looking for fasion type shoes.However it is correct in the construction of shoes for dolls as I worked in a shoe factory and saw and did every aspect of the process of making a shoe.
2,Time consuming,I can appreciate the time that must have gone in to creating the patterns in this book but you need more time than I think doll shoes warrant. Also the patterns are outdated with many steps. I wouldn't recommend unless you are preparing shoes for a doll in older period clothing. Little girls of today may want their dolls clothed in more contemporary attire including shoes.
4,Disappointed,The biggest disappointment was in seeing the difference between how much this workbook initially cost and how much I actually wound up paying for it. Ouch! The booklet itself is easy enough to follow and the patterns are too. I guess I was looking for something a little more modern. I don't know. I was just disappointed.
3,Making Dolls Shoes,"It is not as simple as it looks. One has to have at least some sewing skills and it is not simply explained. A good study of the book is a must before one can actually make a pair of shoes in the right size. All very confusing but after three weeks of practise, i have finally made a pair, with a lot of patience.Conny Fairhead, The Netherlands."
4,Excellent Value,"I purchased this Kapur wood set of 2 almost 5 years ago (August 2007). Nothing compares to the long-lasting beauty and quality of teak, but Kapur is the best alternative I've found."
4,Can't beat for the price,"Great chairs. They were shipped with great care and all arrived without any damage. My only ""knock"" on them is that they almost appear to be stained and sealed rather than oiled. Time will tell to see how they weather, but other than that, they are beautiful."
5,ABIDING IN CHRIST AND BEARING MUCH FRUIT,This great DVD explores John 15 the vine and the branch parable. It shows the walk of a believer and the steps we enter into with this life in Christ. Bruce does a wonderful job with great visuals about vineyard caring and why pruning and other activities that seem destructive are so important for true growth. I loved this DVD and the message of steps of growth and the importance of abiding in Christ. Because of the great props used in this DVD you see what Jesus was actually describing and the nueances of a vineyard are explored. This is a great exploration into the importance abiding in the word and in The Father to bear much fruit for the Kingdom. By abiding in Christ this bearing fruit is not works of the flesh but of the True Life of Christ flowing into us and then through us. You cant go wrong getting this DVD. Be blessed JB
3,Ni tanto que queme al santo ni tanto que no lo alumbre,"Yo lei este libro en el verano de 1999 y la verdad no le encontre algun significado, es decir este libro no es lo que promete. En cambio recomiendo que lean un libro de Charles E. Sellier with Joe Meier llamado UFO. este libro si que se profuindiza en el tema OVNI y pone a la luz fenomenos que han estado pasado recientemente en nuestro planeta."
1,Good for couple months and then,these ink cartridges clogged up and destroyed my brother printer. All the color are mixed up after few months of use. No wonder the prices were so cheap. I had to throw away the printer and all the ink cartridges.
5,Old Time Camera,"I thought these two films were great. It is an awesome product to my avant garde collection!Nickelodeon (not to get confused with the television network) is a preety goofy ragtime film that takes you back to an era where silent films were big. I enjoyed it! Found it comical. The Last Picture Show I really found myself into is a coming of age story about a dying Texas town and the teens who endure their last days together. Excellent drama! And great storytelling! Both films have their style. If like nostalgia, these films are for you."
3,"Great Thesis, ponderous writing","Having attended several lectures by Dr. North I know him to be a brilliant man, but not the most engaging communicator.This book has a small summation of several important ideas of the role of uncertainty and technological change, and how economic actors move to adapt to these. Nothing could be more topical these days. Unfortunately, I find the writing unnecessarily dense and even the simplest issues are treated in a verbose manner. I always love reading Hayek, Friedman, Mandelbrot and so many others; but despite my great interest in the subject reading this book was a chore.Only for the technical experts or very motivated enthusiasts."
3,Never A Dull Moment for Bernie in Middleburg,"Bernie and his friends are doing some investigative work to determine what the big building is that is being built in the town nearby. At the same time his sister is told that she must jump from an airplane using a parachute that she made at the Bassledorf Parachute Factory. His poor sister, Delores; she is finally in love and now she must jump from an airplane. Bernie, his brother, and his friends are suspicious and are determined to get to the bottom of things and find out who is to blame for this unfair task that has been forced upon his sister."

3,bulging billfold,"(This review is by my husband)This wallet holds all my credit cards, ID, license, pictures and cash, and in doing so is difficult to fold so that it is flat in the pocket. It certaily does not add to a slim profile. Nevertheless, I find it to be ideal for my use, allowing me to carry all the items I need in one bulging unit."
5,Husband loved the wallet.,Wallet was nice no problems with the wallet at all The credit cards even fit in to the slots
1,Trifold Wallet,"Although it is attractive, it is useless. Slots for credit cards are too small. I would NOT recommend this item under any circumstances."
3,Catholic apoc,"This book was very good in spots and in others not so good. I've noticed early that they write of certain religious views.The book is from oxford press, and you can fill in the rest for your self. If you can get past the many saved totally by works, theme most of the storys are neat. But always with anthing out side of the accepted cannon be cautious and judge for yourself. God bless."
3,Western Winds,"Lacey Garrett was raised to fight for what she believed in, and to never surrender. When she inherited her father's sprawling Texas ranch, the Reina, she was determined to run it on her own - despite the many men who wanted both Lacey and her land. But a deep secret she was unaware of threatens her dream!Rafe Parrish shattered Lacey's defenses with his piercing eyes and arrogant manner. Beneath his teasing bravado was a man of dark secrets and hot blooded temper. He came to the Reina to claim Lacey and he would have her, one way or the other.Now Lacey must fight for what is rightfully hers - or succomb to Rafe's hungry passion, beyond all reason and all control!"
4,modern refractory practice,"the book is about refractory and its practices. being its a older book does lead a hand to how refractory was build not like modern day . where blanket , castable , pastics have replaced most of the brick.but it has still has a lot of information."
2,Woman's history set back 1000 years!,I love Victoria Holt! I have read most of her books. This book was great right up to the rape scene. I feel that I am not giving anything away since the other reviewers mentioned this aspect to the plot already. I thought that the character would grow and develop from this experience but in the end she is still a victim! The ending of the book was terrible as well. It was as if the author had five minutes to write an ending and just wrote whatever came to mind. My eighth graders would have come up with a better ending. Borrow this from the library and buy The Silk Vendetta or The Night of the Seventh Moon. They are both excellent books.
4,It's Just a Fantasy,"I find it humorous that so many rate this book so low because of the rape scene. You have to realize when this book was written. In the 1970's and 1980's there was a subgenre of romance novels called boddice rippers. Most romance readers couldn't get enough of them. They usually had a rape scene and after awhile the heroine would come to fall in love with the man who raped her. Some of the authors who wrote these books were Katherine Woodiwiss, Jennifer Wilde, etc. Apparently Victoria Holt figured she may as well try her hand at it, too.Pop psychology at that time said that many women had rape fantasies. It's true. That doesn't mean they want to be raped in real life. It's just an erotic fantasy. Most people know the difference between reality and fantasy. These bodice rippers are fantasy, and a lot of women got off on them. Nowadays, of course, it's totally politically incorrect to write this kind of book."
3,Contradictory!,"At the beginning, I guess Kate should be someone with her own brain and idea. I don't know why VH would make Kate into a paradoxical creature. She was so strong to help her blind dad to continue the business, which to me is an courageous act. However, after she bore a child, she changed a lot. Weaker, not of herself any more. This weakness comes to climax when war time came. She lost herself totally at once when the Rollo entered afterwards.Besides, did western women (I am Asian) of the 18th and 19th century tended to be controlled by their men (boyfriends, suitor or husbands)? Well, the language is beautfully written, lyrical at times BUT I just cannot stomach the idea that women should marry those rich and famous guys who have RAPED them. Not for modern women, right?"
3,"The title says it all -- Rollo is a ""demon lover""","I just re-read this book for the first time since I was 11 and I still find it entertaining. Other reviewers complained that Kate falls in love with her rapist. Well ... Rollo's not a very nice man, but Holt makes it clear that Kate is enjoying herself at least some of the time. It's one of those love-hate relationships. Kate's attracted to a strong, domineering man who finds her irresistable, even though she knows he's a barbarian. And that IS one of the archetypal fantasies that women have deep, deep down even though no normal person actually wants a Rollo to kidnap her, drug her and force himself on her. It's a fantasy, so it's safe. This book was written in 1982, about the time the ""Luke and Laura"" phenomenon was going on. They were popular and so was this book. People liked the idea."
1,I threw it across the room,"No fooling. ""Caution! Bad book!"" It went flying across the room and hit the wall. *G* It started out okay, but the bloody idiot goes ahead and falls in love w/ her rapist. I lost all respect for the character. I admit, I didn't finish it. I skipped ahead and saw what happened. Bang, thump as it hit the floor. Then I gave it away to the first poor, unsuspecting soul I could find. If you must read this book, stop halfway through, unless you too are in love with your rapist...in that case, go seek help. You need it."
3,The product doesn't match the picture,"I was a little disappointed when receiving these shoes. For the money I shouldn't complain, but they are alot narrower than they look in the picture and I have wide feet. The color was a little darker than the picture as well. The look is okay, I'm scared to try them on just because of the narrow width, but I guess I got what I paid for. After wearing these a few times I give them zero stars! They have no support what so ever, and I actually had to go to a foot doctor!!!UPDATE: After wearing these a few times I give them zero stars! They have no support what so ever, and I actually had to go to a foot doctor!!!"
2,Disapointed,I bought this monitor in April 2004. It broke December 19. It started going to sleep in November and then on December it went permanetly black. The paper work needed by Sony inorder to send a replacement (refurbished) monitor was faxed and recieved by Soney that day. After many calls to Sony and promises of prompt replacement still nothing almost a mounth later. With warrenty service like this you should count on keeping a back up monitor if you buy a Sony. At the time we were in the market for a wide screen plasma TV. We got one but it was a Pioneer not the Sony we were looking at.
5,Beautiful screen,"This monitor is expensive, but the resolution, crispness and lack of ghosting make it worthwhile if you can afford it. One cool feature that isn't really mentioned is that it has 2 analog vga inputs and one dvi input, which are all selectable.This is a very nice, high end monitor. I would recommend it if you have the funds."
2,Flexi knife,"This knife is very sharp, but has a _lot_ of flexibility in the blade. If you're cutting something hard (think carrots or harder), the tip of the blade can easily deviate more than 1cm either side of centre as you're cutting. I havent cut myself (yet- knock on wood!) but I can see how it could easily happen if you're not paying close attention, or if you're paring something with your fingers close to the blade. If the knife were a bit more stiff, it would be great."
2,zzzzzzzzzzzzz,This book pretty much sucked compared to other books like it. A waste of money. I'd pass on it if I were you.
2,Bleh,"I wanted this book to be good. I really did. It had what I was looking for, info on the most important aspect of cartooning: the writing.But, unless you intend to create cliche, unoriginal cartoons, this book is not for you. Because that's all it does. It explains in detail the most common cartoon character stereotypes and how you should use them. it tells you what is normally done and tells you to do the same. cartooning is not about following paths that have already been followed. i enjoyed The Naked Cartoonist by Robert Mankoff, cartoon editor for the New Yorker. It explains the creative process in general.Here's my advice: don't listen to advice from cartoonists who aren't even successful themselves. they clearly don't know what they're talking about."
1,disappointed,"I will never know how this product is because I never got it. This is the second time this has happened. First time it was resolved, but this time I'm still waiting.Don't think I'l be making any more purchases."
2,Not quite what was expected,"We were very interested in this DVD because we hoped for a fascinating tale of that intrepid traveler--Ibn Battuta. It starts off well enough but then only gives a brief glimpse into his journey to Mecca. The story drifts from the past to the present and seems to just drop off leaving the viewers disappointed. Some of the scenery is very nice and well-photographed of that dramatic landscape but the story line is quite disappointing. From the interviews at the end of the DVD, it seems that creating a film there was not without its challenges so the producers, directors and artists do have to be given some credit for the attempt and credit must also go to the authorities, who have only a small film industry, for working with the filmmakers. If you do buy it, just know that it isn't a robust story of his journey."
3,I really expected more.,"To be quite honest, when I saw the preview I thought that this movie might be emotional and educational. But it was more of a documentary with demonstration involved. That's not what I was hoping. Other than that, the scenery were really captivating."
5,Stunning,"I saw this movie in an IMAX theatre. Easily one of the most moving I have ever seen...it is so sweeping in the telling that a home television could never do it justice. Some movies are just like that. None the less, I am purchasing two copies for my sons because it reflects the true spirit of the Islam I know and identify with."
2,A Rehash of Old Grudges,"It's difficult to understand the enthusiasm other reviewers feel for this book. While I am a staunch advocate of Second Amendment rights, ""Stopping Power"" adds little to the debate. The book contains very little material written orginally for this edition; rather, it's a compilation of various unpleasant e-mail threads and letters to the editor. It seriously aggravated me to have paid for a book containing verbatim transcripts of junk I could have read for free on the Internet. Mr. Schulman is bright and makes some strong arguments, but overall the work is shoddy -- petulant, unscholarly, and devoid of editing.Pass on this one."
5,Excellent. I have a new favorite everytime I listen.,"I was only familiar with ""For Real"" when I bought this CD, but the rest of the album is wonderful too. Granted, they really know how to take a theme and run with it. The phrase ""Black Sheep Boy"" appears in many of the songs. I love the female vocalist in ""Get Big"" but my current favorite (this week) is ""A Stone."" Over all, a sad, beautiful masterpiece of an album."
4,"Great band, good CD","I saw Okkervil River open for the Decemberists, and The Decemberists made a huge mistake by picking a band that is a whole lot better than they are to open for them. I was not familiar with the band until then and prima-fascia the CD disappointed me. However, after hearing it several more times I realized it was because they are so much better live. It was the best set I have seen in five years. As happens with most bands, they over-record in the studio. They lose the energy and spontaneity that they have live, (Especially how the bass and drums come together) but the CD retains the pure sublimity of the song writing. It is obvious that they came out of ""the live music capital of the world"" (Austin) Their sound is difficult to classify, but it is sort of a combination of rock, country and folk. If you are familiar with ""The Ziggens"" they kind of sound like them only more folk, and in my opinion better. I would recommend the CD, but if possible see them live."
3,Highly rated... guess I have to listen more,"This album was highly recommended on many sites so I decided to give it a try. True, it's a good album and worth buying.But, sometimes a little too much Bright Eyes and even Counting Crows. You got to like the singing I guess, otherwise the songs are all ok."
1,Absolutely worthless,"I bought these figuring I'd put them to good use as I'm always struggling to find funnels when I need them. Upon my very first use of these funnels, the long nozzle piece simply snapped right off of the largest one. And of course, it's after the return period so I'm stuck with two teensy tiny funnels and the broken larger one. I wish I'd had a need to use these earlier on so that I could get them returned...lesson learned."
5,funnel set,"exact right size for filling our oil lamp, I looked everywhere for a funnel that would fi, no store had one, this was it, plus it's stainless steel and there are 3. one I use for my massage oil bottle."
2,Not good for powdered drinks either,"Apparently, they cannot be used for sugar or powder drinks because the powder will not go down the funnels. They are made fairly well and are very pretty, having made a nice decoration for my kitchen. But as far as a useful purpose--other than decoration-- I have not found one yet. There is no quality without a purpose."
2,quality control,"These funnels seem to be well made, but they do not all nest together as they lead you to believe. The two small ones do nest together, but the big one will not, which in turn will make them hard to store as they will not all fit in the same space. I believe if they had better quality control, they would have been fitted before being packaged. I feel like I am stuck with this product, because it would cost me more to send it back than it would to order another set, which may have the same problem again, so I am leary now about ordering Norpro products."
5,Love it,"Beautiful stainless steel funnels, come with key ring, slides into one another for easy storage (the middle funnel doesn't fit completely into the larger funnel but enough to be stored as a whole). Funnels are a little smaller than I anticipated but it's okay, I'm still happy with my purchase."
4,Nice but small,Smaller than I expected but my fault for not looking at dimensions. Photo would benefit if it were taken along side some other object.
5,great for little bottles!,"I bought the funnel set for making vanilla and found uses with my essential oils. They are the perfect size for small jobs, and they are a food grade stainless steal."
3,smaller than I thought,"These funnels were much smaller than I anticipated. There may have been measurements listed, but I missed them. I will keep them as I believe I can find some use for them."
2,Way too small,Be advised that these funnels are VERY small. The largest is about two inches in diameter. If you intend to use them in the kitchen or garage; buy a different set. Make sure to check the dimensions prior to buying!!
4,Mini Funnels,"These are very tiny funnels. Didn't realize how small they were until it arrived. The smallest one holds about 1 grape, medium about 2-3 grapes, larger about 4-5 grapes."
4,"Functional, small funnels","Nothing wrong with these: I needed a set of funnels to transfer essential oils, powdered spices, and herb vinegars into small decorative bottles for gifts. These do the trick. They are stainless steel, solid, nest nicely, and come with a clip-ring that keeps them together.Good value."
5,Great funnels,I love these funnels. The price for them was very reasonable. They are so much nicer than plastic ones and are good sizes. They work perfectly.
4,Perfect for small jobs.,These funnels are perfect for jobs in my kitchen!! I have used the largest one to put water in my steam cleaner.
5,Super Quality,"These funnels are heavy, shiny stainless steel. The smallest one is especially what I was looking for to pour salt into tiny shakers. They arrive quickly and in perfect condition!"
4,Exactly what I needed!,"I needed some small funnels for various reasons, most recently to transfer olive oil into a cruet that I had purchased. I chose theNorpro 3-Piece Stainless Steel Funnel Setfor two reasons; one it was stainless steel as I prefer that over plastic funnels that can retain flavors and smells and two because it was included in Amazon's 4-for-3 promo, making it a better deal. Since I received them I have used the medium size for the oil and the large one to add peppercorns to my grinder without spilling them like I had previously. They are connected by a detachable ring which is nice for keeping them together and allowed me to clip them on the dishwasher rack for cleaning."
5,Beautiful but small,"I wish they were a bit bigger. They're made pretty well, the stainless steel seems to be of good quality. The edges are not sharp, all in all it looks pretty good. I'm sure I'll have plenty of use for the biggest pieces, not so much for the smaller ones. Still, it's a good purchase, just have the size in mind."
4,"Cute, functional, shiny mini-funnels","These are well-made, small funnels useful for many low volume funneling needs. They seem perfect for specific jobs like funneling clear liquids into food dishes but they are rather small for thicker liquids or higher volume pouring needs. I bought them for crafting purposes and they are probably good for mixed drinks and smoothies. They store well by fitting together and are connected on a stainless ring. Great kitchen gadget!!"
3,These are very small funnels,"If I had better read the description I might have seen that. Excellent for the children's chemistry experiments. For cooking, no so much. They are high quality though and useful for small liquid and powder transfers."
1,"""THREE FUNNELS"" that will only funnel liquids!","These funnels do not work with sugar and/or powdered drink mixes. There is a flat spot where the powder and sugar hang up and I have to bang the funnel on the top of the bottle I'm filling. I am VERY disappointed/disgusted with this product, it should state in the discription for liquids only. I should be given a credit for them and the opportunity to order other funnels."
3,Um Damn these are small,They are well made but Damn.... um they are friggin tiny! I will now proceed to purchase a NORMAL size set of funnels. Did I say these were small? Damn!
2,really small,"They look alot bigger than they are. If you need to fill salt and pepper shakers, perfect. They are well constructed, but need to be 2 to 3 times bigger"
2,these are tiny!!!,"Okay, I admit I didn't read the fine print on how small these funnels are. Oh well, my daughter will enjoy this in her play-kitchen."
1,read,i was so disappointed when i received this product coz the biggest funnel has a long vertical dent on its stem and the return sticker was taken out!Norpro 3-Piece Stainless Steel Funnel Set
3,These are small ones.,"The picture is a bit misleading. Wished I read the dimension carefully. These are really small ones, cannot serve my purpose. They are still in my cabinet, maybe one day I can find some use of it. The quality is good for sure."
3,Funnel Set,The description was kind of vague as to the sizes of the funnels. I ordered them with hope at least one would be useable. I got lucky. I needed one a little larger than the largest one. Perhaps I will find a use for the two smaller ones some day. It came on July 7th rather than the 10th as estimated.
2,Alycia,Well the funnels are ok and are stainless steel but they are so small I doubt I will ever use them. When I bought them I thought they would be larger. So I got them with my other Kitchen items I never use .
5,This cable rocks,"Just like many musicians out there, I have about every adapter in the world and tried to get by with using them to make recording possible. It WAS possible, but the sound quality definately suffered. I tried this cable and there was no signal loss or noise caused byt the cable. Totally worth the $$$."
1,"Nice Try, But No","You know, when I saw this book, I knew I had to have it. After all, I very fondly remember the Choose Your Own Adventure books from my teen years. This book ain't it. The authors get way too mired in stereotypes of the cool, East Village wanna-be player and instead wind up with vapid characters in contrived situations with improbable endings."
1,Before you buy this...,"think about what you really like in a book. If you like well thought out characters, interesting plots, good, concise writing...then don't buy this book! It has a great premise, the old ""Choose your own adventure"" style of the good ole days, but don't be fooled. The CYOA of the past was 100x better than this! Short chapters, tiresome plots, and a boring premise (get laid in 24 hrs? is that all there is in life?) is all you will get with this book. Save your money and get a real book. Or heck, get a CYOA-the real kind. They were much more interesting than this."
2,try the other series,"Great concept - but if you enjoy ""Choose Your Own Adventure"" then try ""Tangle in Tijuana"" and ""Beauty Queen Blowout"" from the new Miss Adventure Series. They are hysterical, and naughty (and authored by me) -- Please give it a try!"
1,What a Rip-Off!,"The premise of this book looked really fun, and I enjoy reading about 30 somethings struggling with dating, etc.. I started reading and finished within minutes! I started again, making different choices, and also finishing within minutes. The idea is cute, but I would much rather sink myself into a nice, long, detailed story."
2,Uggg!,"This book was almost exactly like the Choose your Own Adventure books that I read when I was a kid, except for one thing--THE ONES I READ WHEN I WAS A KID WERE GOOD. This book was so annoying. The characters were self-involved: your best friend is passed out in the bathroom doorway and you're mad because dragging her home may cause you to miss your chance to score? And the stories lack description and plot development. Some of the twists could have been hilarious if the authors didn't try to spit them out in four sentences. A little more depth would have been beneficial."
2,Outdated,"Philip G. Zambardo obviously wrote this book for the 70s generation. A lot of the theories that he offers about shyness have not stood the test of time. His self-help methods are overly simplistic, and he doesn't really have a handle on how shyness affects people. Especially disturbing is his praise of Synanon, a 70s cult that eventually became mired in controversy over forced vasectomies, beatings, and attempted murder. Very little to offer to the modern reader."
2,not that good,"The book is *outdated*. It was written in 1979. Some of its theories really freaked me out. I thought there was some thing seriously wrong with me. And it's not that informative. The impression I got from the writer is shyness is not normal and it's some kind of a character defect that needs to be treated. I read a part about shy people tend to become perverts, rapists or killers. That's not true.If you want a great book about shyness, then you should buy ""Shyness: A bold new approach"" By Bernardo J. Carducci, Ph.D. His book is recent and the information provided is totally up todate. He doesn't think shyness is a character defect that needs to be treated, etc."
5,I love this....,"My 4 year old was throwing up every where, I gave her a few drops of this in her mouth and it stopped right away, it's amazing. I also took it when my stomach was turning and it helped me too. Great product!!"
1,Not what I expected,This is NOT a good cd; Song choices are not that good.Would not buy this again. Will be giving it away.
4,Thumbs up for Gospel's Top 20!,"My family and I have enjoyed this CD very much! Some of the songs were very well known to us, others were not but we listen to all the tracks every other day and sing along. Thanks for making this collection available. We highly recommend!"
1,not good,eived this one they shipped me out the wrong item so i never reordered it sorry there is nothing to say i didn't get it so i have no comment and i believe if a person do not have anything to say just leave it alone don't try an make someone say more than what they want its not right would you want someone to do you that way
5,good feeling,"When I sat down and took a listen to the music on this CD, I just had a marvelous good feeling from it all. I trulyenjoyed it and surely wasn't disappointed from purchasing this item. thank you....."
3,So so,"There was a few good songs on there that I liked , maybe 3 or 4 . But the price was okay, I like up beat old gospels"
3,Just OK,"I like the album, but realized that many of the songs contained on it we already on albums I already have."
4,good enough for beer pong,"I haven't actually used these for table tennis, but they worked fine for my party. There was a perceptible seam in the ball that may affect a more demanding application."
3,"Good material, not enough",Hard to go wrong with Walt Kelly's Pogo but there were only a couple of weeks worth of strips. An expensive couple of weeks.
3,The start of Walt Kelly's swamp friends,"We see the daily growth of Kelly's sophistication and humor. Strips are a little muddy in places, but always readable. For die-hard fans, this book is essential; for those who jumped in with I Go Pogo or later stuff, you can pass. Glowing introduction to WK's life."
5,Super Seiko Watch!,I had purchased another Seiko watch at a favorite department store for about double the cost of this Seiko. I returned it and ordered this watch. I really like the gold face and the number markers and especially theluxury of having a second hand. My husband was able to remove the right number of links in the band to have itfit my wrist. It looks beautiful and keeps time perfectly and the price was great! A good buy.
5,Good value for the price,I purchased this watch for my fiance' and she was very pleased. It is a small watch and has a handsome look. A good value for the price. I would certainly purchase this watch again as a gift.
4,Nice delicate small watch,"The watch is smaller than it appears on the pic. I would recommend doing an online google search to get a better idea of the size. It is very light, but still a very nice watch. I bought it as a gift for my mother and she loved it."
4,"Ghostwalk, role-palying in the afterlife","Okay, you have that 20th level character you been playing for over 5 years, and although it would seem impossible, you flub a saving throw and something completely unexpected happens... your character gets killed! Now I never seen it happen in all my years of gaming, but I heard stories of gamers actually starting to cry because their greatest character gets knocked off. But cry no more... your character can now live on as a ghost and be more of a badass than he ever was. Ghostwalk is a new ""campaign option"" rulebook, that runs as a stand alone campaign setting, or a new realm that is easily integrated into an existing campaign. Ghostwalk takes your players and their characters past the Veil of Souls into the city of the dead where they continue on as champions of the afterlife. The book features over 70 new feats, a bunch of new monster templates, bizarre magic items, and tons of new spells like ""Charm Undead"" and is a must of any campaign."
4,Decent options,"The product has a new campaign setting for use to spice things up a bit if necessary. If you're looking for a plethora of new feats and classes for PC use, you'll probably be a bit dissapointed. That being said, still some good material to pull out for your campaign"
3,An interesting variation on what is a 'ghost'?,"For most of my gaming experience (1E, 2E, 3E and soon 3.5E), if mycharacter encountered a ghost, then my character had a good chanceof becoming ""toast"". This book introduces the concept of a ghostthat is not an insanely evil undead, but rather merely an incorporeal being, who is not ready to venture into the Afterlife.It is too soon to tell if this book will become part of our ongoingcampaign but it provides interesting options."
4,Review of the Safire segment,Perhaps had I seen this segment at the time it was made I would have taken greater pleasure in it. But the Presidential Campaign of the year 2000 does not seem interesting now. Safire makes a couple of predictions especially in relation to the candidacy of John McCain which turn out to be wrong. I have always thought of Safire as the most witty and word- knowledeable of writers. But somehow here in this interview he sounds a bit dull.
4,"Engaging, satisfying","The Girl She Left Behind by Karen Bichoux is a slightly melancholy treat that deftly tackles issues of place and identity. Montana seems to be all the rage these days but this novel relies more on story and characters than the environs. Silver Creek is the sort of small town that many of us dream about but how would it be, really, to live there?"
3,Above Average,Music videos interspersed with commentary from the then band members. Reminds one what a shame it is that Belladonna is no longer with them.
3,Memory,This is a very good camera but do not buy a 1 or 2 gig memory card as they do not work in them - a 256 mb sd card will record up to 53 mins!
3,A long run,"Run Man Run is a sequel to one of the great Spaghetti Westerns ""The Big Gundown"" unfortunately The Big Gundown isn't released on any format here in the US,so unless you've seen it on Cinemax or purchased an import,this movie might not appeal to you as much.This is basically the continuing story of Cuchillo (Tomas Milian) the Mexican knife-throwing bandit,and his search for lost gold,with a Mexican Revolution spin thrown in.This movie is a wannabe Leone type epic that comes off being episodic.At times this is a very good film but at others it drags on.Sorely missed is Lee Van Cleef who would have greatly improved this film,Donald O'Brien's character is a good one,but the chemistry was much better with Van Cleef.A decent Spaghetti,but way too long."
3,Ok... Nothing like it's predecesor,"I bought this film shortly after I saw The Big Gundown. I was hoping it would be as good but it wasn't. I wasn't bad but some of it was lame. Tomas Milian was funny at times with his Cuban accent when he was cursing. As in The Big Gundown, you don't get to see too many knife throwing scenes but the ones seen where cool. If you can locate, get The Big Gundown. The DVD quality is fantastic as all of Blue Underground releases."
3,disappointed,"I am very glad that I collected a lot of her earlier recorded CD's. On this DVD the band is as great as it ever was and they really do cover for her when they sing ""background"". She was fabulous and I've loved her for years but it hurts to hear her sing now. Too many years and way too many cigarettes. This DVD is no where near as good as the other studio recorded one with all the early images of her singing in Cape Verde bars."
4,"Dark, engrossing fiction","One of Cheever's darkest and angriest books, it's easy to see how his personal troubles spilled over into the characters of Hammer and Nailles. This is allegory to be sure, but too often allegories like this end up with characters who feel like nothing buy puppets instead of people. That never happens here. Hammer and Nailles are fully formed characters with their own fears and phobias. The book reads quickly and ends with a great knockout climax that stuck with me for days. More so-called ""literary"" novels should follow Cheever's example and tell a good story with precision and tension."
4,"Dark but satisfying, well-crafted.","Cheever slowly and deliberately fills out the image of a suburban town, by setting character vignettes and then delving deeply into descriptive personal details. At first this effect is a bit off-putting, like a conversation going on a bizarre tangent; but Cheever's consistency and execution make it an effective (if unorthodox) prose approach. This book deals with several issues like depression, addiction, marriage problems, and general dissatisfaction with American life with very few positive or humorous moments. Despite the dark mood, Bullet Park is a satisfying read from a great American writer dealing with the two sides of suburban life: appearances and reality."
4,Small collection of 1960s dailies,"This is one of the smaller and later S&S Pogo collections. It has a short story ""way out in the land of Calabash"" not related to Pogo, illustrated sheet music for ""Deck us all with Boston Charlie,"" and about 400 panels of Pogo comics from 1960s dailies. By 1960 the comic had settled into a comfortable routine and the entirety is quite enjoyable."
4,The saga of possibly the greatest fighter pilot of WWII,"This beautifully crafted book chronicles the legendary feats of Hans-Joachim-Marseille, Germany's ""Ace of Aces"" in WWII and arguably the greatest fighter pilot of WWII, if not of all time.Easy to read and thoroughly exciting, this book is a real gem. Highly recommended!"
4,A Good Overview,This is book is a good overview of the life of what many consider to be the greatest fighter pilot of all time. The book contains many pictures on glossy pages. A must for any collection of Luftwaffe Aces.
4,Fashionable Listening,When this item arrived my child was very excited. The excitement has not stopped because the quality and durability is impecable.
1,Cypher of Genesis,"This book is a very tough read without first having an understanding of hebrew, qabala and gematria or numerology. The ""revolutionary"" concepts may be clear to the author, but his interpretation to the uninitiated falls well short of complete comprehension."
2,Two stars for an immense amount of work,mr Suares should be praised for his inspired work yet cautioned for venturing into the realms of doubting Mozaic law. His insights into Genisis are profound however his insertion of modern western shortcomings in morality are irresponsible
1,Beware!!!!!!!,"This book is not what it appears to be. This is not a book to build up Christianity, Judaism or Islamics. On the contrary, I have never seen anything written with such a tone as this author has for God. Our God is good and not out to do us harm or mess with our minds. The Old Testament is real and not a myth as Suares wants you to believe it is. This book is not deciphering some code, he is using it to make you believe his way."
4,Interesting look at what was to come,"Filmed at New York's Improv in 1971, we see a young Pryor working on perfecting the kind of material that made him famous. More polished versions of some of these routines may be found on the 1971 album ""Craps After Hours."" However, witness the powerful moment when he alludes to his mother's prostitution, then drops his head in sadness and takes a drag from his cigarette after realizing what he has just said. This scene alone is worth the price of admission in this important look at what was to come."
2,A star is born,"The birth of a baby is a wonderful event, but it is something that I would rather not witness firsthand. Live & Smoking is the birth of Richard Pryor. I'm the first to argue that Pryor is the greatest, but this early performance is very hard to watch. Pryor is obviously drunk or high, very nervous, and not funny at all. The footage is ugly and between the low sound quality and Pryor's occasional incoherent rambling, thank heaven for subtitles. This DVD is of interest to diehard Richard Pryor fans only. It is amazing that he could take this seemingly terrible act and somehow refine it and polish it to grow into the star that we love. To casual comedy fans Pryor says after the credits, ""I guess the [show] wasn't as funny as we hoped."" Heed his warning and check out his other shows."
3,"Good, but far from his best","The most disappointing thing about this video is that it fails to capture Richard at his most manic; get 'Live in Concert' for that experience. But it still has some great bits that any Pryor fan will love, and more than a few bits that any casual fan will enjoy as well. Also marred somewhat by Pryor's nervousness, which manifests itself in too many moments of utter silence."
2,Dissatisfied,"Not too happy with this selection (Sorry, Richard) Not too funny, I think this maybe his first stand up comedy. If not his first, it should have been."
2,Disappointed,"This is not the best Richard Ptyor Concert DVD. He's stiff, not funny or spontaneous . I returned it for credit . A huge disappointment for a Richard Pryor lover."
3,A good book for the absolute begginer.,"This book is a great way for the absolute novice to learn the fundamentals of making music with a PC. The book starts from the very basic, 'What is sound' and gradually moves on to intricacies of sound editing and manipulation. The CD that comes with the book is jammed with a great mix of programs, including a preview copy of Cool Edit and a really good guitar tutor. The biggest criticism of the book is it's failure to mention Cubase, a program anyone who is really serious about computer music should get to know."
5,Great book for frustrated families,"Although written very simply, this book allows the whole family to connect with the issue of aspergers. This book allows Aspergers Syndrome to be talked about, and not be a pink elephant in the living room. A little over priced, though..."
3,"I bet it's ok, but our bird didn't even try it :(","I even tried to put the biscuit on top of her regular food, which resulted in her not eating at all for 2 days :-/ I guess they were wasted on her.I don't give it less stars because they are probably good for birds that aren't as picky as mine, but wanted to share the experience in case you have a similar concern."
3,high contrast but narrow angle,"Comparing to projection to the white painted wall this screen really produces much brighter and higher contrast image, BUT......but only if you're viewing it from almost the same angle where projector is installed. It magically sends brighter image to where the light came from, and the fact the screen is grey makes dark areas darker than on the white wall.Forget about "">100 degrees"" they advertise it with.Sitting at even 25-30 degrees to your projector the white wall will look much better.Looks like the only setup to actually see brighter and higher contrast image would be to have your projector on a coffee table in front of and not too far from you (or -- between you if there are two spectators).In my setup, when projector is installed to the right from the two chairs, sitting on the one close to the projector makes a picture better, and on the second one -- much worse."
5,"Nice looking, well made","it is a nice watch really, with this picture cant say anything but really, you will enjoy using it"
2,The dimension of the backpack,"Within the specification posted on the Amazon, we need to know the inside dimension rather than the outside dimension so that we can decide whether it can pack our M-Audio keyboard."
4,"There is no ""Paperback"" edition! it is the study guide only.","Do not order the ""paperback edition"" thinking wow, it's much cheaper. The paperback edition is the study guide, not the textbook."
3,Sometimes reads like a dictionary,This book looks pretty and I was very excited about the subject matter. I was taking Psychobiology as a general education class and the teacher chose this book. The book is filled with so many definitions that it almost reads like a dictionary at one point. The second chapter has over 100 key words listed. It is constant factual information that leaves you bored and burnt out by the end. This would be appropriate possibly for a class within the major of biology but not for a beginning class.
1,Disappointed,"Item is not as described... Chrome finish?Not, it is gray and looks cheap.My hubby testedit before installing and light is broken. Returneditem the following day."
4,Price Was Right,This product is an inexpensive way to update an older bathroom. It looks modern and was easy to install. The bulbs are bright and the racks are sturdy.
5,What it was really like,"This isn't some glorification of war. There are no heroic stands and modern-day Thermopylaes, not even cynicism. This was what it was really like on the Eastern Front. It is brutal and cruel. Ordinary people have their lives brutalised and even those who resist seem to rarely see the enemy; bombs fall down from unseen planes as they fly over the forest. Both my mother and my uncle experienced events very similar to those depicted here; piles of executed naked bodies (what were once your family and neighbours) piled up against the barn, watching ordinary people being burned alive in another. If you feel like sitting back with a beer in your hand waiting for some gung-ho war movie (even if it is an intellectual modern verion shot with ""grim realism"") forget it. This is a war movie, not Hollywood."
1,Total Crap,"I bought this movie from amazon last week because of all the glowing reveiws. I was very disappointed with this slow moving piece of garbage. Ive watched many foreign films including Russian ones such as ""The 9th Company"", ""Thunder Gates"", and ""Chistellith"". These films were excellent but Come and See was terrible. I realize that atrocities occurred on both sides of the Eastern Front but this movie is pure one sided propaganda. ""Defiance"" is a much better movie in this genre. My recommendation is Not to Come and See this crap movie!"
1,save your money!,"Ah, another DVD I purchased based on the reviews. This movie is absolute rubbish! The first 60 minutes are extremely boring and a clumsy attempt to draw the viewer into a weak Russian style melodrama.If you made the mistake and paid for this movie, view the last twenty minutes of it. See the bad Germans do their thing and the heroic Russian partisans be heroes at the end. What a disappointment!"
1,"But seriously, tovariches..!","Brutal, tedious and unintelligible.Yes, most wars tend to be that way, but that doesn't mean war movies ought to be so. This one is so tepid and outlandish, it borders into self parody. To avoid that, the director then tortures and slaughters animals -for real! Oh, and last but not least, many among the nazis wear Polish uniforms; an ill attempt -my guess- to justify the (in)famous Katyn atrocities committed by the Red Army.Made in the last years of Soviet cinema, after glasnost it should have been retitled ""Stalin meets Pole pot""."
1,AWFUL!,"Absolutely THE worst movie I have ever seen! Poorly made, poorly acted, long, drawn out, I wish I could have given it zero stars. 2 hours of my life....WASTED!"
1,Too much....,"It is easy to blame Germans for everything and show them as a bunch of beasts but I want to see the truth not some kind of horror movie. I haven't seen any believable Russian movie aboutWWII yet. By the way, I grew up in Russia."
1,Top of the line sleeper!,"Looking for an excellent WW2 movie that I have not seen yet, it was hardly that! I found it to be very boring with little action. Watching partisans trying to pose for a picture in the woods that seemed like 30 minutes in the making and the main character alone in the woods with a girl for God knows how long was far from my expectations. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. What a bore! I am not sure how people would rate this 4 and 5 stars, but ""to each his peach"" as they say!"
1,Where do I start ?,"First off bad transfer, dont give me made in 1985 crap. I own a Blu-Ray copy of ""Gone with the wind"" made in 1939. Pristine.Art house war movie, minimal dialogue. The director uses (Ad nauseum) facial expressions to convey narrative, which gets old real quick. Slow paced with very little character development. Glad it was only a rental.Maybe I watched the wrong movie, based on these ridiculous claims of some reviews calling this the greatest War movie ever !, really ?Please save even the rental fee. You have been warned."
4,THE NAZIS SPECIAL TREATMENT OF THE RUSSIANS,"This is a totally shattering film about the unimaginable horrors inflicted on the Russian people by the nazis.This is what happens when an army, brainwashed like zombies to believe that they are the ""Master Race, launches an aggressive war of anhiliation against a people they believe are ""sub-human""."
5,A true work of art.,"To be short, if you love film, you must see this movie! Come and See is one of the two films that compelled me to become a filmmaker. I've seen no other film that and no other director that utilizes the raw power of the medium to the magnitude that is seen here."
1,1 Star for the DVD - 5 stars for the film,"The film is superb but this is the WORST DVD I have ever bought. The 5.1 mix is appalling and there are frequent pauses in the pictures. The film is not very long but has been inexplicably split over 2 discs meaning a disc change half way through the film.The film is a must see, but not on this DVD. Buy the video version instead, you get the same film with no interuptions and without the sound being messed up."
4,"Weird Foreign film with a capital F, then it becomes amazing.","The first half is so drawn out, slow and culturally weird it was hard to sit through. I kept waiting for the action. The story picks up half way through and is shocking if you are not familiar with the Eizengruppen SS.I watched this movie to see the depiction of how the Nazis came upon a town and then commited their atrocities. They come out of the fog and the scene is very creepy. You may have seen the grainy WW II footage of shootings and executions in documentaries before, but here you see how the SS laughed and joked and were drunk and commited rape. There are a couple of good books to educate yourself on how sick the Nazis were. Try Masters of Death and Hitlers Willing Executioners. This movie is the only depiction of the Eizengruppen SS I have ever seen. The documentary footage only scratches the surface of what the SS did. This movie shows it in greater detail and disgusting reality, even though only a movie."
5,Come and See,"This is not a war film I agree. Note that nowhere in the plot partisans and victims of the horror attack their enemies as ""beasts"". In fact, evil for evil's sake belongs to the our species and not to animals (Lucretius), so this is what the film is about. Electronics blending of colours and music mixes add to tension, usage of camera anticipates Danish ""Dogma"" filming standards. Out of the deep abomination, a spark of light. No other piece of art stands the challenge of facing the total war's abomination while maintaining a pure eye.Forget any other film, come and see this and remind this could happen again."
5,3.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:One of the most disturbing and powerful war movies ever made, Come and See is somewhat unstructured but incredibly haunting; if you can watch the last half an hour or so of this movie and then want to go out and fight a battle, then you have my sympathies."
5,The moral duty to portray a genocide,"Klimov's film is probably the greatest film of all time in its attempt to portray the genocide Russian people suffered at the hands of the Nazis. Klimov has a unique, almost surreal vision of the war drawing on techniques of cinematography and themes from Bergman's ""The Shame"". ""Come and See"" portrays the Nazis as total beasts stopping at nowhere in their attempt to materialize their monstrous ideas. Falsely accused as pro-partizan, ""Come and See"" raises the issue of the moral duty of the artist to portray unspeakable catastrophes avoiding at the same time to adopt a voyeuristic perspective on war. A brilliant film in all respects, judged both in terms of form (superb cinematography) and content (clear and unbiased view of war crimes). END"
1,"5 star movie, 1 star dvd",Don't buy this. The film is in poor quality and some of the subtitles have poor translations. There is also very few dvd features. Buy the RUSCICO release instead.
5,Initial reaction: My God,"There is no equal to this film, compared to other war or holocast related movies that I have ever seen; this movie is horror made real. If I were trying to raise the awareness of the public of the real meaning of the extermination of humanity, the real definition of absolute and total war, I would send doubters this tape. Thanks to Kino and Amazon for resurrecting this video to the ""available to the masses"" status that it now has. It is everything that prior reviewers said that it was, in my opinion, the greatest, and most moving, movie I have ever seen."
3,Not Impressed,"I read some reviews that sparked my interest, but I have to disagree with the hype. While there are attempts to capture the emotion the victims must have experienced in this terrible situation, it was way overdone. I was empathetic for the main character's struggle, but the movie is missing a key ingredient and it just didn't come together for me.There are a few very disturbing scenes that involve mass murders at the hands of the Nazi's that made my skin crawl and I think that those were done well. But I'm struggling to say much else about Come And See that is positive - not for me."
3,Typical Soviet War Movie,"As is so typical in films prouduced in the U.S.S.R./former Soviet Union, long on mysterious emotions from the characters that are dragged out to a mind-numbing degree.The film work was good, and not a bad movie overall, considering the source."
3,Bizarre Movie!,"This isn't the worst movie I've ever seen, but for all the hype, it's not the best ever. It is interesting, if for nothing else than it shows the Soviet plight during World War Two, something you would be chastised for probably during the Cold War here in America.But, if you like intense psychological movies with much symbolism that deal with war, then you'll love this movie! The end, though, was pretty cool, I'll admit!"
2,Disappointing,I felt the book contained very few tidbits of insight into Meher Baba. Many of the stories told described a relationship that can be observed between any loving owner and a pet.
3,This book didn't fit my needs,"The book was directed more toward referring in a more social type atmosphere. I did get some out of it, but it really didn't go in the direction I needed for the type of business I work for."
4,Endless Referrals,this book is very interesting to say the least. It gives the reader a very clear view on how to keep an endless network of clients or team member to recruit..
5,Endless Referrals has taken my business to a whole new level,"I just recently finished reading ""Endless Referrals"" by Bob Burg. Wow. Wow. Wow. As a neophyte in the world of self-employment, the information in this book was to me as water to a desert traveler. The principles are practical, they make sense and - lo and behold - they are 100% workable!!! This book totally changed my overall philosophy on how to approach my everyday personal and business contacts. This alone resulted in a number of referrals and suddendly business has never seemed so effortless. At first I almost felt guilty! I am recommending ""Endless Referrals"" almost on a daily basis to other business associates and I am now starting my own networking group! These are exciting times! Thank you, Bob Burg!"
2,a great book? really?,"I had high hopes when I purchased this book. The reviews were numerous and glowing. But I have to say its a disappointment. I suppose if you are selling commodity products, or undifferentiated services, some of this advice could be helpful. But overall it seemed caught in a time warp, tired and old advice. Then I went back and looked at the reviews and saw that many were over 10 years old. No wonder it seemed dated. If you're just starting out, or your industry, business or customers are not tech savvy, or your customers are not wise to these gimmicks, then this book might be OK for a starter. I just have to believe there's better stuff out there."
5,Endless Referrals is wonderful!,"The ideas, such as including my picture in promotional materials, are practical and easy to implement.By following the advice on meeting new people and cultivating relationships, this book helped me develop a strong network of referral sources. The ""Ten Networking Questions"" do, in fact, work every time. I memorized them and use them regularly with great success."
5,"Endless Referrals, Third Edition","I've read Harvey Mackay's ""Dig your Well Before You're Thirsty"" and Bob Burg's ""Endless Referrals"". While Harvey does an excellent job of providing the philosophy behind networking, Bob has driven home the entire concept by providing the nuts and bolts ""how to"" that you need to actually get it done.Awesome book! This is a gotta have for business owners and professionals second only to air and water!Glenn K. GarnesPefectNetworker.com"
5,Best way to get clients ever!,"This is the number one book on how to network and get all the clients you will ever needs...not only is it about networking it is about life and how to be a real human being!Love the book, love the man.The master networker!A1++++++++++++"
4,Great Guidance for working referrals,"This is a wonderful book, full of practical steps to have networking work for you from the inside out.Somewhere in the mid 1980's we stopped really working relationship based networking, and we started working , as Bob Burg so delightfully puts it in this book, credit based networking. A kind of...""If you give me a referral I'll give you one"", or ""you owe me from before"".And anyone who has tried that approach knows...it goes completely south after that. Well, Mr Burg's book is full of practical tips and how to's in allowing people to know you, like you and trust you. The three big keys in building successful business relationships.I am a Regional Director for Leads Club, a referral based networking group that supports small businesses in building relationship based referrals. I completely support what Mr Burg says and have requested each member buy this book."
5,BEST BOOK ON GETTING ENDLESS REFERRALS!,"I bought this book over 2 years ago to learn how to master the technique of getting referrals on a daily basis. After reading this book, I have had great success in obtaining names for my business. This book helped me to overcome my fears and it taught me how to be relaxed while making a business contact. This book and its advise has made me a very successful person in my field of business. For anyone wanting to succeed in contacting and referrals for their business, this is the book to read!"
5,Just read the book and start prospering more!,Bob Burg's book is one of the best on how to get simple yet effective systems in place. With-in a couple of months the results will start trickling in. Then with-in a year this by-word-of-mouth Tsunami hits with a force that you won't believe. Be careful what you ask for. If you want a flow of constant quality referrals this is THE book you should buy.
5,"Excellent, priceless advice!","Bob Burg's style is positive, upbeat and entertaining. I refer to ""Endless Referrals"" frequently. The ten questions in the second chapter, along with chapters eight and nine have contributed tremendously to my success in various endeavors. These parts alone are worth more than the price of the book. With that said, however, ALL the material is outstanding; the ideas for achieving success in all areas of life are pragmatic and energizing. Bob Burg's work stands out in that way certainly, but also couples the road to success with making the world a nicer place by promoting respectful interaction. This book is not to be missed!"
5,Great Sales Book,As a sales person I can strongly reccommend this book. It was an easy read and packed with useful information that can be applied every day. If you sell anything...read this book.
4,Betrayed,I like all The Ciampi/Carp Books!!! They always have a Great story with a good twist or two!!! He always keeps you in Suspense and has good endings!!!
4,Resolved,"A little darker than the rest of Tanenbaums ""Butch: Karp series.. but fun reading as always"
3,"thrilling, but not top-notch","This is the first Tanenbaum novel I have read. It is thrilling, but Karp's family is even less believable than Alex Cross's - fortunately also less saccharine. Much of the book reads like a superhero comic book. Any moment I expected the kid to toss down his accordion, put on his cape, and fly off through the sky faster than a speeding bullet. The family did not engage my belief, and thus they did not engage my sympathy, or, frankly, my interest. Unless the intent is to write fantasy, a good author should be able to portray the desired effects without reaching for ridiculously unbelievable characters. Also, there is a long drawn-out scene of getting drunk, which seems to add nothing to the plot or the development of any character. For a lawyer, this is excellent writing, and the book is exciting."
4,long awaited,"This is a fast-paced well-written Butch Karp story that ""resolves"" a long-standing issue. Good dialogue. Fans of these stories will enjoy it."
4,Promising Contribution,"I have read through the book, and noticed contributions by well known researchers in the field, including Rob Koper and Kinshuk.The main feature perhaps is that its organization is according to the cognitive focus areas which is novel and that these ideas are applied to various different domains including web searches, e-learning, etc.It's weak point perhaps is the lack of strong connection between the chapters, but overall I felt it was a good buy."
3,"An opinionated,fairly complete look at the subject","The author does a fairly good job of describing the bodyguarding activity,covering basic security principles .The weapons coverage is very good,pointing out the effective and well proven tools of the trade. The book could use more information on fitness, medic first aid and radio communications."
3,Not what I had hoped....,"This cd is good, but certainly not what I had expected for the price. I bought it for a friend of mine who moved here from Paris, and she also said she has heard much better cafe music on other CDs. For te price, look elsewhere."
2,doesn't last,"It smells alright, not mind blowing like all the reviews, doesn't last for more than three hours. I guess I could carry the bottle around with me and spray every three hours, not"
5,The best bit scale model kit of the WWII Imperial Japanese Navy battleship Yamato,"This kit from the Japanese hobby/model company Tamiya has to be the best model of the superbattleship Yamato. For the uninitiated, the Yamato was the largest battleship ever built at approx. 813ft long and displacing in excess of 64,000 tons. Her nine 18-inch (diameter) guns are the largest pieces of artillery ever mounted on a warship.This model kit depicts the Yamato on her final sortie which would eventually lead to her sinking at the hands of American naval aircraft in the Battle for Okinawa. The kit is impressive in details, the tooling being excellent and the scale quite accurate. Even when built right out of the box without additional accessories would make the model look impressive. Even if you are not an experience modeller, the fine quality of the model will make you look like a well-tuned pro."
2,Not worth the price,"I bought this book at the recommendation of a friend of mine who had a national company. I have read lots and lots of business books that are much better. There are several tiers of business books the 7 habits, How to win friends and influence people group. There is a pretty large group that is in a tier below. And then there is the third tier that someone had a friend at the publishing company. Nothing new to see here and not even a good rip off of better books."
4,CEO Tools:The Nuts-n-Bolts of Business for Every Manager's S,"Having access only to the Table of Contents and one page of text, I believe that this book addresses the vital area of business tools and that the tool types covered are most important. What I can't state, from only the one page of content, is how well this is done."
5,Amazing!,Amazing product! The item was exactly what I was looking for and expecting. The description online was accurate and the product arrived in a timely manner in secure packaging. Thank you!
5,EXCELLENT SERIES,THIS SERIES IS A CLASSIC PERIODDDDDD. IF YOU LIKE VAMPIRES AND WEREWOLVES THIS IS IT BUT IT IS AN UNDERWORLD STYLE TELEVISION SERIES.
3,If there were no Vampire: The Masquerade...,"I've been playing Vampire:The Masquerade RPG for nearly a year. The main topics on series are kinda good for a modern vampire scenario, but the characters ,events and environment are really minimized. A very young and weak prince, a few primogens, like the prince they are too young and weak . Everyone embraces everyone Masquerade rules of Camarilla are always flexible , makin' love , eating and drinking ... Without the Masquerade game this would be a really nice TV show. But for a player of the game , it seems really funny."
3,NEVER leave a man hanging,"Why did they have to end it like that?! 90210 did better than that and it was dull as a library (90210 that is). The cop knows the truth, Kate the reporter is suspicious, there's a new Brujah primogen in town with a grudge, and the prince is left alone with his sire's spirit.Do NOT buy it if you think there is an ending."
1,This series should have never been made!,"I watched this ""horror"" series twice: once to check it out, since I'd been playing the roleplaying game it's based upon for quite a while before &, the second time, to confirm I hadn't watched something else by mistake &/or if I just had watched a ""fluke episode (one which was awful beyond words)"". I didn't. The only conclusion was that this stuff was a waste of time: It was that awful! Crap's crap, no matter how you re-package it.I wish Amazon had zero or negative stars!"
3,The Review,This was the product i was looking for it was in its originly book and new and had no defects .
4,kindred,"i saw the episodes when it came on t.v. i thought the show was great,and it's nice to see thet they are out on dvd.i've never read the book it was based on,fully,but from what i've read the short lived series is better than the book.although,i wouldn't advise anyone to jump and get it because there are other moviesthat are ten times better than Kindred."
4,An old favorite,"I watched this show when it originally came out, and I was incredibly dissapointed when it died after only one season. I didn't find out about Mark Frankel's death until a year or two ago(I thought the show had gone the way of Forever Knight). It has an engrossing story that can suck you in. It is supposedly based on the white wolf Vampire: The Masquerade Role Paying Game, but except for a few minor details it is in a world of it's own. The Five clans (Brujah, Gangrel, Toreador, Nosferatu, and Ventrue) go through all the back-stabbing infighting that you might expect from them, but they are led by the charismatic, and highly compassionate, Julian Luna: The Prince of Peace. It's not as great as I remember it, but it is a must see. If you don't buy it, for God's sake at least rent it. You won't be sorry."
4,RPers misguided,"Well I'm sorry to all the Role players out there that played Vampire the masquarade and expected this to be an adaptation of the game on film. IT'S NOT, just accept that fact and enjoy it for what it isThis series was fantastic. I watched it when it was aired, and just picked up the DVD and watched the entire series again. The drama pulls you right in. Although I'll admit the acting seems a little rough in certain spots, but overall the acting is very good. Good enough to pull you in like I was saying.Like others I'm quite disappointed that the series ended and nobody will pick it up again. I think they could replace the actor for Julian Luna and people would accept that it's just a new actor, they wouldn't even have to work it into the plot, but with a fantastic world like that, I'm sure they could."
3,NOT COMPLETE!!!,"I do not know anything about the RPG on which this series was based. I do not think it was ever intended to be faithful to the RPG and just the basic idea was taken to the TV series (talk about plagiarism) to the disappointment of many who are fans of the RPG.My greatest disappointment, though, is that this is not *COMPLETE* at all. It is just a collection of a few episodes of the series. I wish they will fix this by releasing all the episodes on DVD.This is not an exception unfortunately. Another example is what happened with *The Outerlimits New Series* which had only one season released on DVD. When will they have a little more respect for us consumers of their products??? We are not asking them to give it for free, we are PAYING for and we deserve better service!"
2,C. Thomas Howell SUCKS!!!,"If you really wanted me to get into all the things that are wrong with this purchase, I would bore you... But Basically, This is not a bad purchase if you're a White Wolf fan and like the political end of Vampiire: The Masqurade. But Spelling is a butcher. I'm glad he doesn't do anymore shows. I think Joss Whedon would have done better... but look what he did to Buffy... Hmmm."
2,Don't waste your money.,The series is horribly written and acted. It bears little resemblance to the game it is based on.Vampires are running around during the day! WTF?
3,It could have been better...,"While the series was pretty good, the DVD leaves much to be desired. There are not special features, no behind the scenes, nothing, it's just the plain raw episodes. The black space where the commercials were along with the title page each time could have been left out. It looks like it was just a raw copy with no work done at all.The second disk is easier to figure out the sequence to watch, while the first one you have to look in the back of the box to figure it out.And as far as clicking on the name and starting, that doesn't happen. It just goes into a scene selection menu, where you then cannot just click on the first scene, but you have to play ""find the cross"" in order to even have it click at all.This collection was a big dissappointment in the DVD arena, but I will give it 3 stars because at least I was able to watch them and enjoy the show."
5,Meagan Hatfield reviews the Kindred DVD collection,"This is the first and only season of one of the best shows ever put in prime time. I have a feeling if it had been released today, and not in 1996, it would be an Emmy winner!!It follows the ""families"" of four vampire clans and their struggle to co-exist amongst themselves and humans. Their is a sweet/hot love story between their leader and the female reporter investigating their kind. As well as a love story between the leader's ex vamp love and a cop, (C. Thomas Howell).This is a great, diverse collection of gothic vampire shows.A genre one rarely sees done, much less done well on t.v. It definatly rivals any movie on the topic I've seen on the big screen! Rent it, Buy it...Watch it!!"
3,Not as good as it could have been...but better than expected,"I wanted to like this show. And I did for the first couple episodes. Once I got over the whole vampires walking around during the day thing, I was starting to get into the blossoming political intrigue of the war for supremacy between the Ventrue and the Brujah. Then all the sudden it turned into Vampire Hills 90210 with over the top love stories and cheesy storylines. Now mind you, as a Dark Shadows fan, I don't neccessarily mind cheesy, but the series starting to faintly smell of daytime soap. And daytime soap and vampires are not a good mix. But the actors themselves did a fine job considering the scripts they were given, and the series is worth a watch if you're looking for something that isn't going to tax the brain to heavily. The final episode actually gives the best glimpse of what the series COULD have been, and probably goes a long way to redeem some of the other missteps the writers took."
5,found what im looking for and now happy.,im so glad to have found what im never thought i would. if anybody loved the tv show 'kindred' as much as i did . get this collection. brand new and ready to go. so exciting getting this in the mail. thank you heaps.
2,"Aims for two crowds, finds neither.","Aaron Spelling, Mark Rein-Hagen. The two should be mutually exclusive. I loved the original Vampire: The Masquerade RPG which formed the basis of this show. It's dark. It's gothic. Not ""facial piercings and black make me Goth!"" gothic, but ""take an ordinary person, put them in extraordinary circumstances, and watch their decline from human to monster"" gothic.HOW does ""Beverly Hills, 90210"" come to mind, here???? I mean, I can put up with poor acting. This is a little out-there to attract serious talent. Watered down setting? Sure, if the writers decide that they need to lose a clan or two in the translation to TV, I can tollerate that. But making it into a poor soap opera is unforgivable. I kept watching, hoping it'd pull through and come out well. I was sorely disappointed.There were times when I was impressed, when I could see that Mark finally got his way and said, ""THIS is the flavor I'm shooting for"" and didn't get stomped on. For those moments, I add a star."
4,don't judge the series by the pilot,"When the first episode of K:tE was broadcast, I turned it off after about 20 minutes. When I stumbled onto the closing 20 minutes of the third episode, I got hooked.Let's face it, the pilot can be agonizingly cheesy and melodramatic, with heavy-handed exposition and endless repetitions of ""Brujah clan"", ""Toreador clan"", etc., but it's necessary to set the scene. Successive episodes improve, some more than others: the ""Cabin in the Woods"" finale is a tantalizing hint of the series' potential. A scattering of very nice performances - Patrick Bauchau and the late Mark Frankel in particular - take the sting out of others that are equally disappointing. Anyone curious about it should at least rent the VHS or DVD. For a fan, the DVD is definitely worth it, even missing a key scene (Sasha's intro in the pilot, of all things)."
2,KINDRED THE EMBRACED NOT THE COMPLETE VAMPIRE COLLECTION,"I was, and still am a big fan of this series, but I assumed I was getting the FULL series on DVD not just 8 episodes. My favorite charters are Sasha & Cash, the episodes I so wanted to see were when they feel in love and then she was turned by a Brujah well I was shocked that those episodes are not on these 2 discs and if you have never seen the series there is so much missing that you probably will not fully enjoy these 2 DVDs or understand what's going on. I am happy to own it, but it is not what I believed I was purchasing. I can only hope they will come out with the missing episodes so I can then have a complete set. VERY MISLEADING ON WHAT YOU RECEIVE! To my knowledge the actor who played Julian died after the series was canceled."
5,Now is the time to own,"Do you know a Ventrue from a Lasombra? (and do you know the difference between Fortitude and Ignore the Searing Flame?) If you answer yes to these questions, this DVD is for you. and what's more, the price is down significantly. As little as a couple of months ago the price for this disc was up around 80 bucks, way too much. But Vampire the Masquerade fans can enjoy it now at a much more resonable fee. Bottom line? If you ever wondered just what an Assamite might look in action, this tantalizingly brief show will wet your palet."
1,Sucked.,"How to save 30 bucks: 1) Watch the USA Network for the eventual reruns of Dark Shadows 2) Record them. 3) Stop purchasing everything white wolf releases just because it has the ww logo on it. You Drones.This midseason replacement show lacked.......strong writing, distinct characters,purpose,tone,or continuity. Never mind the hokey angst ridden dynasty ripoffs pining for human existance or posing as they discuss the masquerade. The writing was on par with bad,bad web fanfiction ('ohhhhh to never see the sun again my love!') and is considered by many to be one of the most emabarrassing and blatant projects white wolf has released. The cutscenes for Vampire:The Masquerade, Redemption have more convincing acting, more pathos in the voices, and more expressive characters...and you won't have to sit through every regurigated cutscene or soundtrack from every other vampire movie in recent history to 'enjoy' it."
1,I is dumber for watching this.,"After being a huge fan of the White Wolf genre, this was enough for me to quit just so White Wolf would not have the money to authorize anything like this ever again. If you want to bring a story as complex as the World of Darkness to life you do not hand it over to the idiot who made 90210.Any White Wolf fan out there should cringe in horror that this was ever aired. DO NOT BUY IT, it is a waste of money. The Buffy series stayed closer to the Masqurade than this ever did.I am serious, I had to drink heavily with other WW players just to make it through..........that way I could attribute the memories to druken hallucinations and a really bad hangover."
5,Clarks Women's Amaretti Clog -- great deal on favorite brand,"Clarks makes a really solid and attractive clog -- and they are available in narrow widths, which is unusual in sizes over 10. I have another pair of Clarks clogs also 11N, and they have held up extremely well. The Amaretti style is more dressy than a normal clog, so will pair with slacks better than the standard round-toed, higher profile clog. And they look great with jeans, as well. AND they were on sale!"
2,Reviews threw me :-(,"The reviews had me gambling on an author I have never read. I lost.This might have been a book I could finish if the female lead wasn't constantly portrayed to be a TOTAL whimpering pathetic victim while the male lead was boring white bread who found this appealing for some strange reason. It was such a turn-off, I only made it halfway through."
4,STORY WAS PRETTY GOOD,"The only thing I didn't like about the story was that there wasn't enough romance. I was also dissapointed in the ending, I mainly read romance because I like happy endings, in this story I wasn't sure if it was happy or not, kind of left you hanging."
3,"Beware, you don't get all the different colors the picture shows","Yes in the picture some sheets appear to just be a repeat of others, but it clearly looks like you'd get some white as well as various shades of off white,ecru, beige etc. along with the blue, green red, orange, yellow and purple. The item I got was not riverside cardstock, but Pacon cardstock and there were only about 10 colors in it. NONE of them were white or the various shades close to white. There was a yellow, two blues, a neon orange, a red, a green a purple and something somewhat magenta like. Luckily I won't have to return it because I can give it to my kids to use for crafts, but I'm sad that it wasn't what the picture shows and what I was expecting."
5,This book saved my butt,"At ten pm on a school night , my 13 year old son informs me that he has a book report due in the morning on a Midsummer Night's Dream and what he had written was worthless. In fact what he wrote made no sense at all. So I had to scrap what he wrote and use the summaries from Cliffs Notes to write one. It was midnight before I was done, but if I did not have this book, it would have been hopeless."
3,Buy it here!,"A newbe to smartphones, I just purchased the Pocket via BlackBerry's ""official"" accessories shop and paid, with shipping, $32. Rookie mistake that I won't make again.To comment on the previous comments: On the official shop, this product is listed for Pearl 8100s only - so don't buy this for any other model.Also, as stated before, it's a really snug fit, but I'm hoping the leather will soften up a bit with use.The sensor works if the phone is inserted the correct way (1 of the 4 ways that it fits.) This helped me figure out how the phone was supposed to go in the pocket :-) Inserted correctly, the camera lens is protected by just about a quarter of an inch (not much) and the camera flash is left exposed (for what it's worth.)"
3,Functional,I bought the cover for my BB8100. It looks ok although I anticipated a more leatherly feel- Good cover although not too convinent to tot around.
5,Prompt Service,Received product in timely fashion as advertised. Product was in great condition. Would buy again from this vendor.
3,NOT TOO BAD,"I ORDERED TWO OF THESE POUCHES. ONE OF THEM SEEMED BRAND NEW AND JUST LIKE THE ONE THAT CAME WITH MY CELL PHONE. THE OTHER POUCH HAD THE SHAPE OF THE PHONE WORN INTO IT (SEEMED USED) AND SMELLED LIKE FAKE LEATHER. BOTH OF THEM FIT MY PHONE AND PUT IT INTO SLEEP MODE WHILE IN THE POUCH. PLUS, THE PRICE WAS GREAT, SO I CAN'T REALLY COMPLAIN."
4,Like it,"Fits perfectly to my iphone, but its a non leather material and looks like the original one. it has a good price so I remommend it"
4,The design you're going to receive is smooth leather,"Contrary to photo, the design you're going to receive is smooth leather, I like & wanted the nubby."
4,97 Geo Metro review & Installation,"The mirror looks just like the one that was broken. Here are some tips for installation on a 97 Geo Metro:1. Check to make sure you have three screws to fasten the mirror to the door. The screws I took out of my old mirror would not work in the Kool Vue mirror. Screws can be purchased at an auto supply store.2. Gently pry off the black triangular piece located on the door.3. Unscrew the three screws holding the broken mirror to the door.4. Position the mirror on the door, line up the holes in the door with the mirror screw holes and tighten the screws.5. Put the triangular black piece back on. I hit it with my fist after it was aligned.6. Adjust the mirror before driving the car.I gave the mirror 4 stars because no screws were included for installation. The mirror came with a black rubber piece on one corner. The other mirror on the car did not have this piece so I did not install it on my car."
4,A look at the human condition,"The primary charachter is a less than wholesome street performer who is thought to be ""the best snake charmer in India."" Up till the moment when he kills his snake this could be true. Now, he has to face the world of his wife, children, and eventually himself. It is a sad tale of humanity on the edge. The almost nihilistic ending gives one pause to think about their own meaning of life. It's not about India, snake charming, or many other thoughts from reading the title -- it's about one human life attempting to find meaning while cicling in on itself like the snake eating it's own tail."
3,OK for not so serious tennis,"These balls are normal run of the mill balls. I used to like them a lot, but after playing more tournaments and USTA leagues, I found all of our matches used the Wilson US Open balls which are substantially heavier. Now, if I play with these regular Wilson balls, they tend to fly too much if you use an aggressive swing. For players who are out for a casual match I would highly recommend them, but otherwise I would buy one of the more expensive, heavier duty balls. By the way, much better price at Target."
4,"Good Product, Expensive Shipping","Item was delivered as promised, but the Shipping was more expensive than the item itself. Not the company's fault, probably my own for not checking, but that's why I knocked it down a star - check shipping cost before purchasing."
4,Close But Not Quite,"The one negative thing about the book was that only half of the trails listed in the book have maps with them. However, their are several positive things about the book: 1. It is printed on very thick and durable paper (which should stand up will if used while on the hikes). 2. The 50 hikes with maps do have excellent pictures associated with them. 3. All of the hikes list the best time of the day to catch the best lighting for pictures, and are classified according to degree of difficulty.4. The following parks are covered: Banff, Jasper, Kootenay, Yoho, and Waterton. 5."
5,Great photos and plain descriptions,"I went to the rockies with a simple guidebook. But when I got home, I bought this book. Now I regret that I didn't buy this book earlier. But when I look in this book, I'm in the Canadian Rockies...."
1,DON'T BUY IT AT THIS PRICE!!!,"I wanted to buy it along with some other books, but the PRICE IS WAY OFF!! $142.00. I even called but they just say they can't do anything about it. I don't know how else to get through to them. Buy it somewhere else, new, for $28.00."
5,Great perfume!,My mother-in-law hasn't been ablt to find Le Jardin so she was very surprised to receive this as a Christmas gift! Thank you for making an 83 year old lady very happy.
3,"Good guide, but lots of outdated info","Overall, I'm very pleased with Footprint Guides, and this one has the usual excellent set of information & opinions. But,I was disappointed in the amount of stale information in this book. It's just been published, but half the restaurants we selected from it turned out to be out of business. I know restaurants come and go, but some of these had been out of business for years. Maybe we just had bad luck, but there was enough out-of-date info that I'm wondering if they cut some corners to get a new edition out so everyone (like me) would discard their previous edition and run out to get this one."
2,"Bad Sound, Bad Image","Far from being a ""collectors edition"", this video is a very-low quality live record of a ""Journey"" presentation in Australia many years ago. It's not ""live"" in the sense of a ""studio-quality recording of a live presentation"", but simply a record with a camera positioned ""somewhere"" in the audience. Image has very poor spatial and chromatic resolution. The sound is like the one you get with an old TV camera. No computer enhancement applied - and nothing could be done about that, as the source material is very poor."
4,Great version of Komit!,The version of Zwara is about a minute longer with different lyrics and there is just something about it that the other version lacks. Teahouse is the same as it is on the Matrix Reloaded soundtrack. The reason I am most happy with this cd is the incredible remix of Komit that blows away the Bible of Dreams version. It was the one used in The Matrix Reloaded but was not featured on the soundtrack.
2,Tiny,"First of all, I returned this watch. I had read other reviews where people said it was a tiny watch but I only have a 6 inch wrist. How tiny could it be? Well, guess what? IT'S TINY! My daughter even asked if I ordered a child's watch. Picture this....put a dime or nickle on your wrist. 19mm is only about 3/4 of an inch!"
3,Overrated?,"Artaud is consistently, excessively melodramatic. His prose is more exhausting than anything else. He hammers the good points he has deep into the dirt. Still, his work is essential to any serious student of the theatre, not to mention anybody who has figured out that the world is ten times more insane than the people who are called insane."
4,Best book on Fiends I have read,I own all the planescape products so having read and able to compare them. I would say that this is one of the best. I would not run any Campain on the blood war without this book and Hellbound The Blood War box set. Colin Mccomb did a good job on this product. It goes threw each of the Fiend Races and explains each in great detail.
5,Still Holding Up,"Both Comanche 4 and Land Warrior retain a significant fun quotient, although dated. Sure, the graphics aren't like Call of Duty 4 or some of the newer games, but the learning curve is low and the PC requirements don't demand the latest tech. The graphics aren't bad considering the age of the games, and they are still a blast to play to ""save the world"", with a good balance of skill level required (not too tough, not too easy)."
4,Fun for Disney fans and academia,"A look at the title, and even the opening, might lead one to think this book was written by and for academia. That is not true. You don't need to be an architect or engineer (either mechanical or social!) to enjoy this book. The photos of concept art make it worth the price of the book alone! One could happily treat this purely as a coffee table book. If you decide to read it, you will have to wade through the author's occasionally self-serving analysis, but that is not often. This is a quality book, based on an absolutely amazing traveling exhibit."
3,"Good book, great exhibit","The exhibit was excellent. When I purchased the book, I was expecting either an expansion on what was covered in the exhibit or at least a reveiw of all that was exhibited. Unfortunately there were many things that were left out. The illustrations & prints were small & a bit fuzzy & there are hardly any of the maquettes or minatures that were present at the exhibit contained in the book.They also focused on criticism to show Disney's effect on our culture, but there are countless books that go over that.I was hoping for new material with the same insight on the development for the parks & attraction that ""Walt Disney Imagineering : A Behind the Dreams Look at Making the Magic Real"" contained.I enjoyed the book, but given what was at the exhibit, I can't help but be a little disappointed in the book."
5,Don't forget to see the exhibition!!,"Afetr you read this book, you will have to go see the exhibition."
2,Gross Negligence,The author has very strange comments about the nature of the architecture of the Disney parks and the text is hard to read and confusing. I read the book last year and all I remember is that the pictures were interesting.There is also incorrect historical information in the book.Anyone wanting to buy this book should find a copy to look at first. I would have taken it back if I hadn't bought it at Disneyland 500 miles from home.
2,the editor of this book is a syncophant for disney.,"I'm sorry, but beside factual errors. the editor of this book should be on Disney's payroll, if she isn't already. Needs to be much more objective in research. The author is a career professor at a major state university! Shame!"
1,Lame!,"I couldn't even stand the first minutes of any of the songs, like it says it the title, it was a lame CD. I think I even threw it away!"
5,Blackfeather,These are excellent quality German engineered nut drivers. The steel has excellent strength and the handles provide a strong nonslip grip and feel good in your hand. I would make the same purchase if reordering.
2,Passionate but poorly recorded,"Camaron de Isla's pieces on this CD are wonderful and passionate, especially if you appreciate the (what some call) ""moorish"" influence - the anguish and emotional languishing of the sung parts.Unfortunately, the album also showcases other flamenco artists (which would be fine, but it is presented as an album of Camaron's work) and the recording quality is horrific...as though someone whipped out a cassette recorder at an in-home session. I don't believe anything was done to salvage the quality (some digital post-processing)The saving grace of the CD is its passion, which I know I've said often in this review but it is almost palpable. I will check out other CD compilations and perhaps refer you to one of them."
5,"Honda, Closer to the truth","There are two Honda histories in English that are more accurate than the revisionist versions and pablum now available. I won't spoil either, but Soichiro Honda is an interesting character and the true story is far more interesting and respectable than the Tata-mae (truth for public consumption) now offered. The other book is Honda Motor: The Men The Management The Machines by Testuo Sakiya (1982). If you're really interested in Honda history, read both. THEN if you're really serious, look for the unpublished ""The Honda Way"" written by the American executives of Honda of America Manufacturing for the plant dedication in October, 1985; very, very hard to find, though parts have leaked out through the years. Honda is worthy of study. I suspect it no longer exists, but at one point General Motors had a whole committee studying Honda's business model. Yeah, well...they had the right idea."
2,Not original recordings,"We were disappointed that these recordings were re-makes. Some were even from live concerts. Our seller's price was excellent, so we took the chance."
5,Inspirational,"This CD is inspirational, uplifting and meditative. The mix of genres - a little reggae, Indian, etc works beautifully. The soulfulness of Debi's voice sets the tone for each chant leading the listener through various energies evoked by her devotion to the goddess or god in the song. Hare Krishna is one of the BEST I've ever heard. Chant on and on and on. . ."
3,Practical Applications of Research,"The author Bruce Abell starts off in ""Re-Imagine Your Business for Breakthrough Results"" with exploring unexpected opportunities by understanding who you really are, where you can go, and how you got to where you are today.I found that this book is edifying in the sense that in business you must first know who you are, to really help others in your organization.The author goes into depth about the intriquisies of the company and what makes it successful. By taking a leadership role in your company and strategically planning you can implement ideas that will help your company grow. With these suggestions you can help your business be more influential and excel in many areas. Well thought out plans that will help everyone that is involved in the company grow and work together for a bigger purpose is what summarizes what I felt about this book."
2,Expresso Bong.....Oh,"An on target black and white satire of the 1950's pop music scene with only one problem. The music isn't all there. As I remember it , there was at least one other song in the original cinema release and it's omission removes some of the bite from the whole. Overall, a bit of a let-down considering that there wasn't much music to start with, although Cliff Richard does get a reasonable look-in. (Can you believe that he was really nineteen at the time ? He only looks about fourteen here.)Anyway, it is still worth having a look at but I imagine that those expecting to see the same film that they saw all those years ago are going to feel disappointed."
4,Wild,"This is a terrific film. Harvey and Richard are a tremendously entertaining comedy team. The songs are great, and the view of 1950's London is priceless."
3,That's show biz!,"I never saw this movie before borrowing the Kino DVD. I'm familiar with some of Cliff Richards later work in the movies but this film, being less about him and more about an up-and-coming rock star, did not make full use of the the easy humor seen in his later works. Laurence Harvey's performance in Bongo is excellent... the other roles I've seen him in has him portraying hard-as-nails, upper-class types but as a conniving (if good-hearted) agent-slash-manager he is both convincing and well-rounded. And the scene where he does a quick rock-n-roll dance with a girl in order to get to the other side of a club is both perfectly choreographed and funny at the same time, thanks to Laurence's facial expressions. I liked it, although I think it fell short of four stars."
2,Not worth the considerable effort,"At the outset of this review, I have to note that I didn't finish it; got through 243 of the 298 pages. Imagine putting down a mystery, not discovering The Secret when you're that close? A new experience for me. But, I just wasn't interested enough, identified with the characters sufficiently to care about the revelation of The long-drawn-out Secret. Maybe I couldn't get with the foreign, Somalian idiom, despite its being delivered in erudite English prose, replete with metaphor and allegory that I found wearying after the initial challenge. The story is set within the Somalian internal, inter-tribal conflict but, despite references to it, I couldn't get past the worries and carrying-ons of the characters that, although undoubtedly of essential importance for them, left me only wanting to get to the ending to learn The Secret. Finally, I got brave enough to admit that I really didn't care enough to expend the time and energy."
1,Please don't buy this book.,"Incest, bestiality, children having sex, and X-treme casual sex. That's the make up of the first forty pages of Secrets. The only things kept secret are any vivid or lasting description of locale, character development or any plot worthy of turning the page."
1,Don't waste your money!,"This most wretched of ""tributes"" should never have been released if for no other reason than to spare the artists their humiliation. I have yet to hear a collection of ""singers"" who warbled as badly as these people did.This album was released in the late 90's yet sounds more appropriate for the ""hair metal"" 80's. Why this is even called a ""tribute"" is beyond me. In fact, I'm not even sure why I've wasted my time including it here.About the only fun to be had is the cover of ""Tie Your Mother Down"" by Lemmy Kilmister (of Motorhead) and Ted Nugent. They sounded as if they recorded it after a night of drinking, playfully changing the lyrics around, etc.Regardless of that, this release is a complete waste."
3,Golden Years,I finally purchased this DVD through Amazon USA. It was great to see but the definition is not good. There has certainly been no improvement on the quality of the snippets of films included in it.It was made quite a few years ago as well.After all that I am still glad I was able to add this to my growing collect of films from The Rank Organisation which on watch frequently.Please release some more!!!
1,watermelon strawberries,"i like eating watermelons. they taste really good. watermelons are red. bananas are red when they have watermelon on them. eat a banana to make yourself feel better. cucumbers are not watermelons. don't ever stuff a cucumber up your nose, it hurts. La di da di da. the end"
2,these guys are mega wicked crill diggaz,"I really like falafels, and I especially like the vegetarian kind with garbanzo beans. I put lots of onions on it, and then drown it in ketchup. I once ate one that had mustard soy sauce on it when I was in San Diego, but I wasn't sure what bread they used, I think it was PETA. I think I ate in at Falafels and Waffles, a restaurant in San Diego.2 stars,by Chuck the Raver"
4,A good textbook on V/STOL theory,"This is a good textbook on aerodynamics of V/STOL flight. Yes, it has not been revised since the original printing in 1966, but the basic methods and experimental results still apply, just like they did then. The book is aimed very much at someone with a background in aeronautical engineering. It is not for the casual reader, and has nothing about the history of V/STOL flightAs an aero engineer working on the design of VTOL airplanes, its exactly what I was looking for. I give it a 4 star rating just because I dont think any textbook is worth 5 stars! ;-)"
2,1967 science book republished in 1999 with no content update,"Warning! This book was re-published in 1999. It was first published in 1967 and there have been no updates to it's scientific information. This book has no updates for modern VTOL aircraft and modern design techniques.There is a preface by the original author, that does nothing to counter the fact that the book is way out of date in its style of presentation and lack of photos and quality diagrams.Republishing this book seems like more of a money making scheme than to provide information on V/STOL aircraft."
2,Not what I hoped it would be.,"If you're looking for some useful information on VTOL aircraft, keep looking. McCormick derives hundreds of equations, making it difficult to establish which, if any, are relevant or useful. And good luck finding the meaning of the symbols in the equations, which may have been defined several chapters earlier. This book would be best left in the classroom where an instructor could guide the student through the theory. This isn't the practical, nuts and bolts information for the hardcore VTOL enthusiast or designer. All information refers to 1960's or earlier aircraft. The V-22 is only mentioned in the preface of the new edition stating that some of the theory applies. The book has some useful information, but it's not what I hoped it would be."
2,Batting Sucks,"I have never seen a PC game where the computer wins no matter what you do. The batting controls on this game SUCK! It is impossible to hit more than one run at a time, whilst the computer knocks every bowl you throw at it out of the park! Ridiculous game play, poor controls, and as much as I love cricket, this game really ruins it."
2,Visiondecor,"I ordered this ottoman from VisionDecor and they didn't ship my item within the timeframe that Amazon allowed. So the day after the time frame was up, they emailed me with a confusing message about how sometimes it will take longer to ship than Amazon says, but it will take 1-3 weeks. So, I chatted with a representative who said that their warehouse could get it sent out within a week because they only have 6 left. Ridiculous. I cancelled my order. Why are they selling furniture that isn't ready to be sent out? Wouldn't have bought it if I had known that."
4,"Good, some minor critisisms","The book does a very good job in covering literally all aspects of value, risk, cap. budgeting, choosing appropriate cap. structure, and other topics in corp fin. However, what I found impracticable is the sometimes unnecessary complicated language even when it comes to explaining simple things. To me, there is no point in making corporate finance more complicated than it is.That's why good, otherwise would be excellent."
1,Horrible Book,"This is the worst finance book I have ever seen. For a book used for a MBA finance course it is not very helpful at all. If you are not a finance genius this book is definetly a no no. The examples leave you clueless and the theory is very general. Dare to try and solve the unrealistic sample problems at the end of the chapters, and a lot of the solutions in the solutions manual are WRONG! The professor who taught the Finance class, who has been in the field all his life and has a doctorate degree in finance admits this book is garbage and not appropriate for the MBA; beacuse of this we did not even use the book for his course. This is a very expensive and huge book and so not worth the price. I learned nothing!"
3,"Hard to follow, but not bad.","This video is for classic Mob buffs. No one's name is ever given, so you're kinda guessing who they are, but if you already have a working knowledge of the Mafia, you'll enjoy it. It jumps around so you have to pay close attention, but there are good interviews and footage in this one, including interviews with Sam Giancana's daughter and Bugsy Siegal's daughter."
5,Superlative interpreter of Romantic Piano Pieces,"Mr. Duchable brings delicacy, clarity and great feeling to his interpretation of all three composers, to the point of making sound fresh and new again. His precision and real finesse makes the romanticism of a Chopin much less heavy and ponderous than it can be.The Schumann Carnaval is a real revelation and quite innovative as well.Why don't we hear more about this superlative pianist?Bravo, et chapeau bas (hats off) as the French say."
4,Old Man and the Birds birdhouse evidentally not for the birds!,"I have had this birdhouse for at least 3-4 years now and it looks SO good out in the yard! Everybody comments on it constantly, however, not a single bird has ventured inside the mouth (hole) to make a nest. Perhaps it needs a perch in front of the mouth to entice the birds in. If you want a great conversation piece birdhouse - this is definitely IT! It's really well made, the quality is great and the uniqueness of it is my favorite part! I am still holding out for a bird someday to enter it and make a home!"
3,Nicely done.,"Plot description on this book's page. on the copy I have is 1995. I could swear that I read this before, or something very similar. And yes, I did read the first book a few years ago. Interesting story and nice take on werewolf culture. The scene between Michael and Noel was good. Noel has choices to make, and you know he is torn. However, the ""mystery"" was dumb. All in all an enjoyable story."
4,ok,this shows a dj at work... its ok... if he worked harder i would give it 5 stars... but its just alright
2,generic amateur documentary on indonesian marine life,"Definitely interesting, but a bit poor in describing Raja Ampat's under and above the water environments. Rather a generic amateur documentary on indonesian marine life."
1,False advertising,"This price is for the car LOADS ONLY NOT CARS AND LOAD < VERY MISLEADING RIPOFF DON""T BUY"
4,Travel movie of some European countries,"I liked his travels of historic sites which I had seen, but his discussion of restaurants and how to travel tips did not interest me. The picture quality was excellent and his comments were very helpful."
5,Son,This was given to our 10 year old for Christmas and he enjoys this. This is his first gun so I have been teaching him gun safty.
1,Disatisfied,Gun game broken. Called outlet and was told I had to send back to Daisy. End result no Christmas present for Grandson. Still waiting for Daisy to return repaired gun
1,Beware!!,BB's pictured in this kit do not ship with product and customer service is not cooperative in sending them. I am still trying to get resolved!

5,BB GUN?????? More like an rifle!!!!,this kit is great it came with a gun 3 packs of 350 bbs and a tin can of 750 and it came with a gun case and Safety goggles plus 8 shatter blast targets there more like Mini clay pigeons.its range is 50 OR 20 feet i do not really know.. dont ask me why othere wise this is a great GUN for kids 0-10000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 times infinity BUY THIS GUN....................................Guns rock p.s im a gun fan.
1,"""You'll put an eye out kid""","Tried to get this for my father in law but the man wouldn't let me. Apparently a MA to NY purchase of ""firearms?"" is not permitted. Don't burden me with your rules man!"
1,Only 1 included in Box,"Unfortunately, the picture of the item shows 2 cartridges, however, only one is included in the box. it skunked me so please be aware..."
2,Well ........... I thought I was getting something else.........,"From the way the ad in AMAZON was placed for this item I thought I was ordering 5 sanding blocks. But.... I only received one block. You guys were great all the way through but didn't understand that the ad shows 5 items and says ""blocks"". You sent me the exact same item to make up for the item I said was wrong and I greatly appreciate this effort........... I do. But I'm sure someone in the future is going to make the same mistake.It is OK. I'll live with what I have received but it was definitely misrepresented in the picture and wordage online.Thank you for everything just the same.Jimmy Wilson"
1,Very Small,"The actual size of the item is 2 3/8"" x 1 1/4"" x 3/4"". These are tiny at best. Can probably only be used for very small detail work. I did not use them since I was concerned that the edges would cause more damage then good."
2,did not work for me,"I bought this about a month ago and installed it. First, it was impossible to keep it on the wall. It kept falling off every time we tried to take a bag out. Secondly, it was too difficult to put a bag in it. I had to stuff it in there. It wasnt worth my money. Now I just use a plastic bag and stuff the other ones in it."
4,Pretty useful,I have had it for a while now. I like it. There is a little space between the holder and the wall to which I have mounted it. Mounting is pretty easy as there is plenty of space to fit the screw driver. I would say that it holds 20 to 25 grocery bags.
2,Replaced with another,We started with this one but were loathe to drill into the door to secure it. We tried double sided tape but the plastic was warped and curved and would not stay. This product is cheap (in every sense). It does not hold that many bags and is a bit of a pain to use since it does not hold that much and you really have to push and pull to get the bags in and out. We replaced it with a metal version that hangs over the top of the door and is working much better.
3,"Great concept, a little smaill","We have a bag storage unit inside a kitchen cabinet that is roomy and easy to clean that we have enjoyed for many years. Searching the Internet, I tried to get another one just like it, but it's no longer available, so I ordered two of these instead. My only complaint is that they are so small, you can only fit a few bags in them, which sort of defeats the purpose for me being accustomed to a much roomier product. However, the quality and function are fine if you are looking for a small-size bag holder."
2,firewire cable is useless,compare this first to a belkin auto charger and you'll notice the difference in the firewire cable. you'd need that flat thinggy to connect the charger to the new 3G ipods. look for other alternatives if belkins price too high..........
1,Not for the new iPods!,"Actually, it's no star, but they wont let me do that. This charger is not a stand-alone item for the new iPod. It requires a firewire interface such as the docking unit, or some other sort of conversion item. Docking unit in your car? I dont think so. Belkin makes a great unit that not only works with the new iPods, but also has a small amp and volume control built in, with a output jack for plugging a cassette or remote transmitter into.If you have the newer iPods, I suggest you pass on this unit."
1,Poor Quality,I ordered two of these (one as a back up) and neither one of them worked. When I took them apart one had no solder at all on several of the connections and the other unit had a solder bridge across several of the terminals. The company who makes these must have no quality control at all. 100% failure rate on items delivered to a customer is unacceptable no matter how inexpensive the item is or where it is made.
1,Works in name only,"This adapter caused line noise while it was plugged in, defeating the purpose of listening while charging since the line noise was very noticible. I couldn't even charge the iPod while listening to the radio because it also caused line noise in the AM band. Griffin sent me another one claiming it was a fluke and the replacement didn't perform and better. On the second call to Griffin they claimed it was my car. Sure it is. I have other cigarette lighter accessories and none of them cause line noise. This along with the itrip which was a maddening experience, especially in LA where every FM frequency is used (half actually in English!). My experience with Griffin has been overwhelming negative and I would look at other makers of similar gear."
2,May fry your iPod hard drive,"Take this for what it's worth. Your mileage may vary.I used this with my 4th Gen iPod in my car. When the first hard drive died, I thought ""Okay, bad hard drive and I had left the iPod in the car on some freezing nights."" When I replaced the hard drive and that died too, I thought ""Okay, maybe bad iPod design."" But when we used my wife's iPod Photo, which was quite reliable, in the car on a cross country trip and it began to show the same problem, I began to suspect the Griffin PowerPod and stopped using it with the iPod Photo, after which it seemed to run just fine."
1,Worked ok for a few months.. now doesn't work at all,"The charger gives a nag screen each time you plug it in (1G Nano or 1G Video) that is a minor inconvenience, but the real problem is that it has completely stopped working about 4 months after we got it. It shows that it is charging my ipod and then the ipod shows that it is fully charged, but once it is unplugged it dies a few minutes later. The ipod can still be charged from other sources so it's not the ipod's fault. Also, watch out if you turn off/on your car while it is plugged in - on a new car with no other charger problems this seemed to cause my ipod to lock up. Also, not a problem with other chargers. I'm glad we just paid a few dollars for this."
5,Works with both old & NEW iPods!!,"Looking for a car charger, I noticed this one had a removable FireWire cable - which meant I could use any other cable I want. Now that I've upgraded to the new iPod (I got a new 15 GB) I was suprised to discover that it works with the new iPods too. I just use the dock-to-FireWire cable that comes with the new iPod and it works perfectly. Even IF I buy an extra dock cable, it's still less than the Belkin charger at 40 bucks. Plus I can use it interchangeably with my wife's iPod (my old one ;).All in all, the PowerPod is a great value, flexable and future-proof. You can't ask for much more. I don't hesitate recommending this iPod charger to anyone."
3,Review of Firewire Auto Adapter,This product was reasonably priced and almost what I expected. I was looking for an auto power adapter that would power my older iPod. That is I expected an adapter that had a firewire connector to my older iPod. What I got was an adapter that had a firewire connector but came with a cable that had a newer edition iPod connector. Fortunately I had a firewire to firewire cable that could be used with the base plug so it worked out OK. I just wish that the description identified what cable came with the power adapter.
5,ok,"Does what it says it will do, and looks pretty good, too. The fact that it's a charger that's in 2 pieces isn't a problem - I havent had the cord come unplugged yet when I didn't want it too. Plus, you can use the cord to hook into the firewire port of the computer for faster transfer with the iPod."
3,Doesn't work with NANO,"This model is an older model that does not work with IPod Nanos. When I plugged it in, my nano said ""incompatible charger"","
4,Very handy,This is very handy and works great. The picture doesn't show it but it comes with the cord that plugs into the charger and the ipod so you have everything you need in the car.
3,"Not a bad read, but...","A pretty enjoyable book, but not great. The first half of the book was pretty good and what I would have expected. But then there are some king-size plot contrivances and the second half of the book is a little... different. Some of the gore and sex seemed thrown in just to make the book more interesting.I haven't read the first book in the series, so maybe I'm missing some character development from that book, but there were some scenes where I was going ""what!?"". Suspension of dis-belief, sure, but don't push it this far.Caine doesn't really add anything new to the werewolf mythos, but it's still a pretty good book; just not great. The creatures in the book are probably closer to wendigo than werewolf."
1,Dorman 49444 HELP! Wiper Linkage Clip Kit,THIS ITEM WAS NOT WHAT WAS IN THE PHOTO AND WAS NOT WHAT I ORDERED..I RE ORDERED THIS ITEM AND AGAIN I RECIEVED THE WRONG PART SO I WENT TO THE LOCAL DODGE DEALER AND PICKED UP A SET FOR LESS $$$..
5,Great TV Show,This is a great tv show...i just ordered season 2....my family can not wait for season 2 to come in the mail....
3,Syndicated or Uncut?,"Based on my viewing of the first DVD in the set, the episodes appear to be airing the syndicated version with two minutes cut out for extra commercials. In the original network airings, the episodes in the first season were between 24 and 25 minutes long, and they are only 22 minutes long on the DVDs with mostly the shortened theme song, that airs on Nick at Nite. If this is the case, I am particularly disappointed, because one of the reasons I have always purchased DVDs rather than just copied episodes from the TV was because of this very reason. I have some old Columbia House tapes, and at least these provided the entire episode. I would hope that they will re-think this when it comes out with future seasons, and hopefully, they will re-produce the first season uncut."
1,Edit?,"Edit sets are not cool. The only reason we buy TV Show is for the full version or even the extend version of an episodes. Edit episodes make them look like you didn't care about the greatest comedy classic show next to the Brady Bunch. I am upset and outrage and believe that if we riot against network and the producer I am sure they will stop it. We want the original. I make money to buy the original not the generic copy. It like buying off the street, fake copy! pfft. I hope your happy NBC... this is not the first time and I will make sure FCC hear about this."
1,One of the Greates Sitcoms of All Time Come to DVD.,This is one of the greatest TV shows of all time and it comes to DVD along with Rosanne (Another Great) in its syndicated versions. The company responsible gives us the 21 minute versions not the 24. That 3 minutes of time dosen't sound like much but it can make a difference.
1,I can't believe it!!,I thought the Cosby show would be the last show that would be released with edited episodes. There is just NO excuse for this. There is no way I will be buying this set.
1,Edited versions of a classic,"DON""T BUY IT if you're a real fan, every episode has at least 2 minutes cut out! It's stupid to buy such an expensive box set for castrated episodes."
1,Avoid These Edited DVDs,"The Cosby Show is one of the best comedies in TV history and to think that Carsey/Werner would have the gall to release the edited, syndicated versions as ""complete"" is appalling and should be protested by every fan of TV. What made the show great is character development and taking out 2-4 minutes of every episode takes away from that tremendously. I can even remember some of the scenes that were cut. It has nothing to do with ""music rights"" and everything to do with greed, as the syndicated versions were digitally remastered and the original masters weren't. If they can spend to remaster ""The Dukes of Hazzard,"" then they can spend to remaster this classic."
5,Cosby is still great,I grew up watching The Cosby Show. After purchasing the DVD set I find myself back in the mid 80's...but with a child of my own I now have a new appreciation for Dr. Huxtable's fatherly ways. Wholesome entertainment for the ENTIRE family.
2,The Cosby Show,"I haven't seen the episodes yet,but it seems it's the syndicated cut episodes with 2 minutes less than the NBC original airing which is a complete fraud because it's not noticed on the package and in the press conference the Studio stated that will include the original 24 minutes runtime.I think the studio got all the customers complains and will release the Second Season uncut in March to improve sales because First Season's had been really bad."
1,I spent $40 on something I could have taped from Nick at Nite!!!,"THIS DVD IS FALSE ADVERTISING!!!! Why come out with a dvd collection if you are going to release them edited and they are still on televison?!?!??! $40!!!! I could have bought 3 vhs's at the 99 cent store and taped all of them on Nick at Nite in a shorter amount of time that eBay mailed me THIS PIECE OF JUNK!! I noticed the edits when on the episode with Alicia Keys, they cut out the parts where Deniece was dancing with Rudy's friends and they went in the kitchen after Theo for some cookies. CRAP CRAP CRAP!!! I WANT MY MONEY BACK!! They should have warned us. They will BE hearing from me! DO NOT BUY THIS DVD!!!"
2,Great Presentation... but spoiled by edited episdodes,"The boxed set arrived at my home and I opened it with great anticipation. The boxed set is of excellent quality and, as expected, the picture quality of the DVDs are exemplary.But, (and it's a big but), most, if not all the episodes have been edited. Having seen all of the episodes lots of times on TV in the UK, it was immediately obvious that small sections had been cut here and there. Some edits even cut lines that were very important to the overall storyline of the epidsodes!When buying expensive DVD sets such as this, I expect to get the entire series content: not incomplete episodes. It is more annoying to me as the syndication 'thing' doesn't happen here in the UK.I don't really care about extras, deleted scenes, interviews: all I want is to be able to watch the complete episodes, commercial-free!These edits make irritating viewing I'm afraid. I will think very carefully before purchasing any future releases of this series."
2,"GREAT show, LOUSY DVD set","As other reviewers here have already stated, all the shows on this DVD set are the syndicated edited versions. While the cut scenes really don't take away from the overall plot, it is totally illogical for a DVD set to cut parts out of an episode. Why? There are no commercials! Beware before you buy! It's a shame they had to mangle such a GREAT TV series."
1,"LOVE the Cosby show, HATE this set","All the episodes are hacked to bits. It's not worth the money. I hope they release Season 1 episodes uncut. It seems that many, like me were very disappointed with the release."
3,Disappointed of Edited Version,"I'm a huge fan of Bill Cosby in general and of the Cosby Show in particular. I waited a long time for this show to be on DVD, so when it was finally available I got very exited. But once I got it I was extremely disappointed of the fact that all the episodes are cut short. If I would have known this I would have never bought it.Usually movies and shows on DVD come with extra features, such as deleted scenes, so I was actually expecting for each episode to have ""extra stuff,"" not to be edited.I strongly believe it should be specified on the product's description that this is an edited version of the show so the public can be aware of this situation. On the up side, I really enjoyed the ONLY extra feature: the special ""A look back.""Meanwhile, I guess I'll have to keep on waiting and hoping someday someone will finally release every season of this show with the full version of each episode."
1,"I star for this release, but five for future","YEs, this release has been cut, but dont let that get your hopes down, because the Cosby SHow Season 2 will be uncut, just like its original broadcast on NBC. There will be no rerelease for season 1, but season 2 is due in March, 2006. This date probably will change, but this is all we know for now. I recieved this information from tvshowsondvd.com"
3,Just fine for the casual or new viewer,"Other reviewers are absolutely correct in that this set shouldn't be purchased by core Cosby Show fans. I'll also remind that typical DVD extras, such as voiceover commentaries, are entirely missing, replaced by a ""90-minute 2002 TV special 'A Look Back' including deleted scenes, bloopers, audition footage"".However, Amazon's low price and the box and insert's impressive presentation (not to mention the show itself!) make this a fine holiday gift for a casual or new viewer."
5,Life Lesson in Every Episode......,"It is about time the Cosby Show is coming to DVD, even though I have seen every episode many times I will buy every season on DVD. Bill Cosby will make you laugh until it hurts while you watch him and his family try to get through everyday struggles that everyone family goes through. A must for everybody!"
3,Lighting is horrible,I love the Cosby show. This reduced rating relates to the lighting or the poor copying of this DVD. It is horrible. I am so distracted by the bright lights that distort the actual colors on screen I am unable to enjoy the DVD.
3,Time for other sitoms to come out;,"Sice the Cosby Show,Full House,Fresh Prince of Bel Air, and everything else that has came out how about putting out Family Matters.That show was hilarious.Steve Urkel was down right funny.-Did I do that or Look what you did.That show needs to be put on DVD.I am obscessed with that show and the Steve Urkel Character."
2,The Cosby Show-Season 1,"The shows themselves are delightful and timeless. However, I was very disappointed that the Amazon version's captions for the hearing impaired were incorrect. The words of the previous show are broadcast on the episode that I was watching. I returned the set, but the replacement had the same defect."
3,A slow start,"Notwithstanding the shortened episode controversy (painstakingly documented in previous reviews here) while season 1 showed promise it is actually my least favorite of the Cosby Show's eight year run. Cliff and Claire spend too much time fussing, fuming and hollering. It reminds me of the later colorized versions of the Andy Griffith Show where Andy turned into an unfunny curmudgeon, seemingly always in a bad mood.Fortunately, in future seasons, the sometimes negative tone of the Cosby Show was softened (the writing improved too) with no loss of humor. Seasons 2 and beyond are noticeable better than the first... much of it classic situation comedy that ranks up there with the best in television history."
1,boycott,"I'm afraid we really must refuse to by tv DVD sets that are the chopped-up syndication versions or else they'll just keep flinging them out. It's just a slapped-together quick job to make a quick buck off the popularity of t.v. shows on DVD and use less discs and spend less time restoring the originals.We know they can do better. Friends had an excellent DVD release with ADDITIONAL footage. South Park, The Simpsons, the Star Treks. Television on DVD is a fantastic innovation that has come with the technology.But DVD is meant to be a keepsake, a collector's item, archival even. And I refuse to pay one cent for a fourth-rate censored version of a great television program."
1,Skip this and get The Cosby Show: The Complete Series,"I was excited when I found out this was coming to DVD but major disappointed when I saw they were the cut versions. Why is this on only edited season. I got the 25th anniversary with all 8 seasons, UNCUT. Felt much better. I would recommend to all fans of ""The Cosby Show"" get that. The hell with the 1st Season."
1,Avoid this set...shows are EDITED! Not worth your $$$,"All the episodes are EDITED! These are not the versions run by NBC. Save your money; you can see these truncated versions in syndication.This is especially horrible as the company put out press releases a few months ago stating these were to be uncut, and now they release edited versions? I think they should be reported to the FTC and product should be recalled so it can be properly labeled with a disclaimer stating that the shows are CUT."
1,Ridiculous,I've been waiting for this one. But it's ridiculous that they would release edited-for-syndication versions IN A DVD SET. WHY?!?! Don't support this practice. Do not buy.
1,Save your money! You can watch these same episodes on TV right now,"Unfortunately, I didn't read the reviews here before I bought this set. Unlike the uncut versions (the same as the original network airings) that were promised, this horrible set is full of the cut, syndicated versions of ALL episodes. These are exactly the same (to the second) that currently air for hours every day on TV on various stations.Save your money, until they do Cosby right. Until then, just watch the reruns on TV."
3,"It's a nice set, and the episodes are great, but...","...I obtained a prerelease copy for a review for another site. The episodes, despite being touted in the press release as from the NBC airings, with 2-3 extra minutes of footage. Upon playing episodes from the release, however, I was surprised to learn that these are in fact the edited-for-syndication episode cuts that run 22:00 (As opposed to the network 24:00).While the episodes look splendind, and sound quite good, the episodes themselves ARE the cuts you'd see on your local station, and not as-originally-aired. Buyers should keep this in mind before purchase."
5,Please redo season 1!,"I have been waiting for this sitcom to appear on DVD for many years. Though the show is a great classic this box set is not. I am very disappointed and I sure do hope Ventura will redo the first season using the unedited episodes and use the complete versions for releases of the remaining seasons. Fortunately the ""Season 2 set"" features the unabridged episodes. Unfortunately Amazon does not permit a change of my rating otherwise I would reduce it to 1 star."
5,With All This Talk About Season One Being Edited...,"You know, after reading all the previous reviews about the 1st season being edited, and losing 2 minutes of show, here's my thought - At least while watching the DVD - THERE ARE NO COMMERCIALS!!! And I am glad I purchased the 1st season, because I'm sitting down with my kids and watching a great and classy TV show (when TV was good!).Am I disappointed that there even has to be an edited set, maybe. But I guess I'd take a little shorter show without commercials any day over a little longer show with commercials!"
5,Season 1,My friend and I love the season 1 of it and we want all the seasons. The only thing that bothered us was the Looking Back should of been at the end of season 8.
3,Great condition Slow on delivery,My order was in great condition when it arrived. I had ordered a couple of different items and paid regular shipping on both. One item from another company came right away my order from this company came a couple of weeks later. It is in great condition and we are enjoying our purchase. I had begun to wonder though if it was going to come by the time it came.
1,Ripoff,"I'll buy it used on eBay- They're apparantly using syndicated prints of theses shows, although no one has listed the source for that info. I'll buy it and time and then re-review this."
2,why,The cosby show is one of my favorite shows of all time but why is it hacked. why is the cover and box so impressive and cant forget the 13 page book that comes with everything you want to know about the show. But why? why did we get this sindicated mess. All the episodes are incomplete and seems to go by to fast. I know its DVD and im happy to have it but can someone tell me why?
1,Captioning fiasco,"I love the Cosby Show! And I really enjoyed buying the first and second season. However, on disc 2 of season 1, i tried watching three different episodes and all of them had the right captioning... for the wrong episode! Very bizarre and I've never had this happen to me before. Unfortunately, it makes the whole disc completely worthless t ome because I am deaf and rely on captioning. Has anyone else experienced the same thing with the captioning? Other than that, I really enjoyed this set and recommend it to others if you don't rely on captioning or subtitles. Season 2 from the same vendor has no captioning errors."
5,Easy to put on.. and so comfey,I actually bought these in Pink at Ross for about $16. I wish I had bought the gray pair as well. I have loved these shoes. They are so easy to slip on and perform as well as any athletic shoe I have owned. The sole has great grip and the foot support performs well. I work on my feet during the day. This is my favorite pair of shoes.
4,Pogo's Light-hearted Sunday Antics,"This is a collection of typical Pogo comic Sunday strips from 1957, '58, '60, and '61. The artwork is the intricately detailed inking typical of that period of Walt Kelly's work, and the stories are mostly his usual Sunday-strip goofiness without the political messages common in his weekly strips. This collection does contain one of the few political Sunday sequences, six pages involving a Russian pig dressed as Santa Claus.This volume was printed posthumously as one of at ten-volume ""Best of Pogo"" selected by David G. Hartwell with Selby Kelly's assistance. All of its contents appeared earlier in collections printed by Simon and Schuster each year of Walt Kelly's life. The quality of this printing appears to be moderately higher than the S&S; originals. Hartwell's selections are enjoyable, so the casual reader cannot go wrong with this book; those intent on obtaining a complete collection of Pogo strips will find the Simon and Schuster books a better purchase."
1,Not what I expected,"I bought this as a gift for my mother. It burned instead of browned & the digital timer did not work. Amazon was great helping me return it. I bought a Presto & it is wonderful!!! It could be just the one I bought, but I didn't recognize the brand name of Deni, so I will only buy what I am familiar with now."
1,"Works Great, however if it needs repair your out of luck.","I have owned a Deni 8.5 Qt. electric pressure cooker (model 9780) for 15 months and it's has been a wonderful kitchen appliance. However, last weekit died on me. All modes of operation ""brown"", ""keep warm"", ""pressure cook"" or ""slow cook"" no longer work. Actually, nothing happenswhen you apply power to it. I called Deni to find out where I could get it repaired since it is out of warranty and I was shocked tofind out that Deni will only replace (they don't repair) pressure cookers that have failed under warranty. They don't know of any repair facility in the U.S.So, now I am left with a $150.00 boat anchor. Take my advice and steer clear of any Deni electric pressure cooker."
3,Static shock killed it,"I bought one of these and used it probably 10 times over 2 years. Having a pressure cooker was great, and not having to mind the stove while it was going was very nice. Unfortunately, I killed mine with a static electric shock, and plan to replace it with the old fashioned stovetop variety.Sometimes simpler is just better..."
4,Good Product,"It's easy to understand and it cooks perfectly. I would have liked more recipes for basic things, but plenty are available online."
2,Would not buy again,"I have had this pressure cooker for about 4 or 5 years. It did a good job cooking foods, however the pressure unit on the lid broke and I had to pay at total of 30-40 dollars to get it fixed (had to ship it off). The valve has broken again after just occasional use. I am not going to replace it, I am going to get a stove top model. Also, there is about a 1/4 of an inch groove around the whole unit between the outer rim and inner liner that gets gross because it accumulates food particles and oils however it is almost impossible to clean. I would not recommend this product because of the issues with the pressure unit on the lid."
1,The Temari Book - Anna Diamond,"What a poorly documented attempt to teach this craft. Having made temari before and wanting a refresher and inspiration I find that the diagrams and missed step by miss stepped intsructions are worthless. This is an extremely frustrating book to work from, unless you don't read English, are already well familiar with the craft and only want to look at the pictures. A waste of money, particlarly for beginners who expect to glean something other than the desire to throw this book out of the window."
3,gorgeous designs,"not so gorgeous instructions, as other reviewers have pointed out. and why come with a new terminology? so that other authors' books seem more difficult? also, using her inch-based measurements, rather than propotion-based, means having to use only the size ball she uses.the photos are usually very good, but some of the balls have been stitched with no thought for color contrast in photos. as examples of color schemes, some are wonderful--but hardly show the details of pattern.this is definitely not a book for the average beginner. an experienced embroiderer in crewel or silk will recognize the herringbone stitch and that will help explain the construction method, but for others, the instructions do indeed leave a lot to be desired.the designs, however, are wonderful, stunning, gorgeous, and make this book worth owning."
2,Disappointing Instructions,"As others have pointed out, the instructions in this otherwise beautiful book are sorely lacking. I've done several Temari balls from Diana Vandervoort's first book, and had no problems. However, even doing the first one in Diamond's book left me very frustrated. She does not tell you how many rounds to make of each color, so you're left to try to count the threads from the photos. Not a good way to do it.I'm going to purchase the next Vandervoort book...perhaps that will make me feel better about the whole craft!"
1,Worst Instructions Ever,"I am in the middle of making the first ball, what is supposed to be the easy ball. I don't understand what she is talking about. she is referring to the points on the ball with jargon that she has never defined, as far as I have found searching through the introduction. I am currently trying to do something called a herringbone stitch, but the only reference to how to do it are very simple line drawings of the preliminary stitches. At this point I have decided to just make up my own method that will look as much like the completed ball as possible. If I was going to have to just make up my own method, though, why did I get this book?!This text would be improved significantly if the author would be more clear in her terminology (e.g. what exactly does AH refer to??) and including photographs, at least for the first pattern, of someone going through the process of making it, especially with regard to this herringbone stitch."
5,This is my favorite temari book!,"I found this book at the library and was intrigued by the beautiful images. At first, it seemed daunting. Once I actually started a ball, I found the instructions made perfect sense. I love this author's designs and colors. I have several other temari books, but this one is definitely my favorite. I have made about 20 of these so far!"
1,DO NOT BUY GRANT !!!,"Piece of CRAP.Advertised as walnut - actually is stained poplar.Worst part of it all is the wood grip is not attached correctly to the metal frame.It's off center by about 1/16 - 3/32"" making the grip feel wrong. Plus the rivet holes in the wood grip are chipped and they stained right over it. Looks cheep.Save your money, buy another brand."
4,Turned out ok in the end,"The quality of the wheel over all is OK. The first one arrived damaged but was quickly replace with a new one. Unfortunately Amazon sent it by USPS and it was sitting at the Post Office for three weeks, I do not know why the call it free shipping when I have to drive 60 miles round trip to pick up my items from the Post Office, be careful when buying the adapter kit, Amazon makes suggestions on the bottom of the page ""purchaser who purchased this also purchased this"", it was wrong I had to order a different one."
4,All too familiar,"A concise note to those perhaps not familiar with the journalism business: This movie is a wonderful depiction of what goes on before deadline. And I've worked with characters just like those portrayed in the film, and although not every day is that exciting, some certainly are. It's a fun ride."
2,The Paper,"Glen Close and Michael Keaton are funny and well matched in this film. However, vulgar language is laden throughout the movie. If you have a stomach for constant filthy words, you'll laugh and enjoy the story line...if not...don't bother wasting your time watching this movie."
1,What? No Widescreen?,"A movie such as ""THE PAPER"" really deserves to be presented in its theatrical scope. I enjoyed the movie very much, but I never purchase a DVD that is pared down from its Wide-screen format to the chopped Full-screen. I'm assuming, of course, that the original cut was in Wide-screen since I only saw it on Full-screen VHS. Am I incorrect in my assumption?"
3,Black and white and Keaton all over,"If you appreciate the energy Michael Keaton brings to the movies, see THE PAPER. It depicts 24 hours in the lives of a New York tabloid crew. The drama of their private lives rivals that of the news they cover. I liked some parts of it better than others but held on for the next Keaton scene. To know why Michael Keaton's a great film actor, look no further than THE PAPER."
5,FUN MOVIE!,This is a FUN movie all around. It takes you into the life of print journalism and gets you involved into the everyday life of news writers and the stress they encounter on a day-to-day basis. Leading the way is Michael Keaton as the hot-shot news writer who's contemplating changing companies to further his status and make the extra buck. He's supported by a great cast of veteran actors who each have a distinct personality that you'll either love or hate. Now that's acting! The great thing about this movie is that it's set in real time like show's like 24 and whatnot. The whole movie is based on this one hectic day and how much of a rollercoaster it becomes.
1,Great Movie but...,"I'm not commentng on the movie. It's a great flick. Keaton is awesome, probably one of his better performances. Quaid, Duvall, Close, Robards and Tomei are all terrific as well, as is Howard's direction. My problem is with Amazon's description. They list it as being available in Widescreen format. It's not. It's the same version you can buy at Wal Mart for $5.00. I bought it under this pretense and not only did I get the same full screen version I already had, I had to pay shipping to return it."
4,Strangely Overlooked,"I can never figure out why people see the movies they do. ""The Paper"" is an excellent example. It has a phenomenal cast: Michael Keaton Marisa Tomei Robert Duvall Glenn Close It is made by one of Hollywood's most successful directors--Ron Howard. Finally, the story is a wonderfully energetic and often very funny account of 24 hours in the life of a New York tabloid paper--sort of like His Girl Friday updated for the 1990s.But NOBODY saw this film. Inexplicable. The Insider was similarly overlooked, and it was considerably more acclaimed. I have a theory. In the 1990s people just don't want to see movies of any type that are about journalism."
1,Awful taste,This is probably the worst flavor of the group. Horrible after-taste of plastic and chemicals when mixed with water. Disgusting.
4,Works Great!,I take it for both pre-workout and post workout. The results are fast and very noticeable within the first 2 weeks. Banana creme is my absolute favorite flavor. I also recommend adding a little more ammino to it for maximum effects. Possibly around 1000 mg ammino. Over all this products is awesome!
2,"Sickeningly sweet, will likely give you diabetes!","Mass gainers in general are protein powders mixed with simple sugars, so it should not be surprising that it is overly sweet, but this particular formulation is so sweet you will not be able to take more than a cup at a time without feeling sick. Mass gainers are supposed to be made for chugging, so this is a bad thing.This will give you a sugar high and cause your insulin to spike, followed within an hour or two by lethargy. Repeat this until your insulin receptors no longer respond well to insulin and congratulations, you are diabetic!I ended up throwing mine out--I hate wasting things but apart from the nasty flavor, I felt like it was negatively affecting my health."
1,Banana Creme,"I have tried vanilla, strawberry, and cookies and creme. Banana Creme smells awful and tastes bad with water. The others taste great with water, especially vanilla and sberry. 3 scoops after every workout to make it last longer."
1,Prestigious jewellery? YES. Prestigious book? NO!,"What an absolute waste of your money. The book is just a collection of brochures taken from all the Haute Joaillerie Houses all over the world, bundle them together and sell it for a hardcover price. The photos are nevertheless breathtaking and, ofcourse, a feast for your eyes. The text is like a salesman in training."
2,Advertising by the pound?,"The alliance of a cheap deals-minded person with, a devoted advertorialist copywriter should produce a very efficient pamphlet for jewelry companies in search of recognition (unfortunatly great Jewelry houses will realize it later on...) This book will be certainly used to display current(?) and complete(?)collections, trends and other over and over covered subjects about fashion and trends... Can and will readers learn something out of sterile press releases compilations?"
5,WHEW !,"Imagine a reallly cool song-ending that just keeps building upuntil the really big finale that blows you away...Now, pick thatup with a piece of silly putty and stretch it out until it's say,25 minutes long. There are two tracks on this album. Every timeyou think the guitar can't go any further over the top, it climbsanother hundred feet up and cannonballs off the edge again. Trulya fun ride; like a rollercoaster that's 15 miles long but nevergets boring."
5,A great intoduction to a great man...,...for any beginner in the field of psychology and Lacanían studies. The best available Lacan dictionary up to date.
1,At the Library of Congress,This book was converted by the Library of Congress as part of the International Digitial Childrens Library and is available for free on the LC website.
3,Only one good movie out of 4....,"The only movie I thought was good was 'Song For The Season' and I wouldn't buy this set again. I think it was overpriced, but Amazon always provides great service and super fast shipping."
4,I think this is truly worth the money.,"We are not talking about Gone With The Wind kind of films with this. But they are nice holiday treats, especially three of them the fourth is nice because Megan Follows is the star and makes it special all by its self."
4,Am not sure what you want here?,"I purchased this holiday Collector's Set for a Christmas gift, so I haven't open them or viewed them. The only one I have watched is Christmas Romance because I already have it."
2,Holiday Collection,"None of the movies on this collection was much better than ""fair"". Not bad, but nothing to 'write home' about."
3,Fascinating,"I think this is a fascinating book (actually part 1-3 out of a 5-part series). A real page turner. But why? As aliens go these are pretty stereotypic: a lion-like species, a dog-like species, a lizard-like species, etc. The story line is muddled, to put it mildly. There really is not much action, other than on a personal level, and what action there is remains very vague. The outline of this book looks as if it was thought up by a housewife with a fondness for cats. All in all, the building blocks that went into this book are very meager, less than 1% of what went into ""Ring_World"". By contents this is a lightweight book: yet it is a pretty enjoyable read. Quite an achievement for a writer!"
2,"Excellent Story & Writing, But Not Complete","I entirely blame the publisher for the bad rating I'm giving this book. The story and the writing are both excellent. However, putting these three stories in one book and saying ""Now in one magnificient omnibus edition"" is a crime. The first story, ""The Pride of Chanur,"" naturally stands alone. It should have been left as a stand-alone book. The other two stories, ""Chanur's Venture"" and ""The Kif Strike Back,"" should never have been sold as separate books in the first place: each requires the other. However, the biggest problem is that ""The Kif Strike Back"" requires (at least) one more book, ""Chanur's Homecoming"" to tie things up. So, don't expect this ""magnificent omnibus edition"" to complete the story. You'll definitely have to buy at least one other book.My apologies to Cherryh on this. Her writing is excellent. It's just her publisher that [is bad]."
1,What a waste!!!,"There is really no need to review this publisher's mistake. Though it is noted that there were some revisions in this edition, they are minor, and unnoticeable and in no way make up for the lack of Chanur's Homecoming. C. J. Cherryh said that Chanur's Venture, The Kif Strike Back, and Chanur's Homecoming actually make up one book, and were broken by the publisher into three parts. To print only part of a book and call it a Saga is lying to the public. My recommendation is to pass this up and buy the whole series on the used market. You will be happier."
2,"Great again, but should include Book 4!","I thoroughly enjoyed re-reading this addition to Cherryh'sUnion-Alliance universe, but was also deeply disturbed that Book 4,Chanur's Homecoming, was not included..."
5,works like new,"no hassel just bolt on an clean away, doesnt seem to cover much are with the sprayer, but it works"
1,Does not fit my 1999 Explorer. Beware - it might not fit your car either,"I FINALLY got my boyfriend to help me replace this on my car. I have a 1999 Ford Explorer and this is not the right rear wiper arm. The Amazon Part Finder tool said this would fit my car, and it does not! The base is not at the right angle, which makes the wiper float about 1 to 2 inches away from my window. I then compared it to the original arm, and there is clearly a difference. Now that we waited too long, I cannot return it - my fault for assuming I got the right item and did not rush into installing it. What a waste of money, and now I have an arm that is useless to me. Beware - it might not fit your car either, even though the Part Finder says it does."
5,A MUST for the WWII movie or history buff!,"I absolutely love, love, love this documentary! I am partial to the WWII era (being in my 30s), and saw a lot of footage and clips that I've never seen or read about before. It is highly entertaining, and very informative for those interested in this time period and it's movies. It makes you want to sing along with the popular songs (if you're familiar with them). My only ""complaint"" would be that even though they play the Andrews Sisters' music, they don't feature them at all during the Hollywood Canteen clips...one of the most popular songs they sang (in the movie), ""Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy"". All in all, it's a winner!"
3,In need of an update.,Rambles a bit and the material is dated as well. Also it covers five or six different Linux floavors but none in depth. Would have been better if it had been more narrow with better depth.
2,Let's try a different author next time.,"I have a working knowledge of a lot of what's covered in this book. The presentation is fairly elementary even for a novice. The level of expertise this book targets would be very hard to learn from just a book. They are better off spending $20 for a pizza anad a six-pack and finding a friend w/ a free afternoon to walk them through explaining and installing Linux. This book is likely to be either too technical or not provide enough information.On the plus side it comes with a copy of Fedora Core and Knoppix but......who's idea was it to cover Linspire instead of Debian. Wait for the next edition which will likely cover Ubuntu, which is likely to become the new Linux standard."
5,Gorgeous pie plate,"This pie plate is just gorgeous! I'll be sure NOT to take it out of my kitchen, though. I might never see it again! My husband loves the size of pie that it will bake. i made a pecan pie in it recently. I used a recipe that made 2 - 9 inch pies. Then just poured all of the filling into this 12 inch dish- fit perfectly and was delicious. It made an elegant presentation."
1,broken pie dish,"Emile Henry 12-Inch Pie Dish Azure BlueI was happy to find such a large pie dish, however, when I received it, it was broken in many pieces. I reordered and again the second pie dish was broken. Sadly, I needed to return and did not have time to reorder another. Thanksgiving was just days away. I was dissappointed."
1,Arrived Broken in Hundreds of Pieces!,"I have made 2 phone calls to the shipper of this product and my broken pie plate is still not being dealt with!I was instructed to leave the plate in it's original packaging and someone form the company would email or call with instructions on how to return it, neither happened. I would not deal with this vender ever again."
4,Work it out!,"I'm giving this product a 4 star review because I do like the work out a lot. Most of the time I only have 20 minutes or so to get in a workout and the Core Transformer works perfectly for me. I do feel the burn while doing the moves and am usually sore the next day. Working out with the resistant band constantly takes a little getting used to, but once you do the moves come easily. The only issue I have (at least with my DVD) is that you cannot get to the cool down exercises from the main menu. When I click on ""Cool Down"" in the main menu it takes me to the closing credits. I have to start the 60 minute workout and fast forward through to get to the cool down, which isn't a big deal, it just would be easier to get there from the menu. Just FYI..."
5,Finally a tool to get rid of 50 years of accummulated Belly Fat,"After 50 years of accummulating Belly Fat, I would definitely recommend the Core Transformer to others. I'm now three weeks into using this product, approximately 4x per week. I've been feeling the effects since session #1, but now after three weeks, and 30' of workout, I'm starting to see the difference. I'm hoping to get up to 40' in the next week or two. Also, as a frequent traveler, I will definitely take this on the road with me."
5,Very Effective!,"Love it! The core transformer workouts are very effective and something I can always do... I wanted a low impact, good cardio and toning workout that doesn't take a lot of time or equipment. I wasn't expecting to see results this quick so I'm thrilled with it!"
2,less than expected,"I had to return this item, because I could not see how it could meet my need for an ""on-the-go"" exercise tool. It felt like a giant rubber band vs. something to offer a little resistance."
1,Poor quality and there is a cord!,"My son was so frustrated with this toy since the remote control is attached to the backhoe with a cord! Also, within days of having this product, both remote control 'joy sticks' broke off of the remote. I do not recommend this toy at all. It caused more heart ache than anything else!"
1,"At best, a poor collection of ill-connected articles.","I have a large amount of admiration for the Taunton Press. Fine Homebuilding is quality magazine and the For Pros books have been worth the money. This book is a poor collection of disjointed FH articles that have no cogent flow to them. I should know better than to buy books by ""Editors,"" but I made a mistake here. William Spence's ""Constructing Staircases, Balustrades & Landings,"" while not a perfect book, is much better than this collection.Taunton's ""For Pros"" books on Electrical (Caldwell) and Plumbing (Hemp) are well worth the money, particularly Caldwell's offering."
1,do not buy this book!!,"As an installer by trade, I urge anyone interested in learning the construction of stairs to consult another book. I wish I had read the other readers comments before I wasted my money on this book."
2,Not enough detail,"So I don't know why I bought this book without reading the previous reviews. I usually check those first and avoid books like this. It had too many types of stairs to be documented and not enough detail for each one. I would have rather had just three basic types of stairs covered in detail than all of the types in here. The writer appeared to be showing off.Still, it did show me what I needed to purchase (bending rail) and had about two pages worth of useful information. I finished my curved baluster, but I see flaws in my work. I am a pretty ambitious DIYer and I would not recommend that anyone try doing this but a professional. This book did not give enough detail or complete instructions to help me through the rough spots."
1,Why bother,The book addressed building stair-related structures that were just not relevant to standard stair building needs...
1,Building stairs is a huge responsibility,"They must work perfectly every time they are used for the life of the house because someone can be horribly injured or worse, including the builder. Not for a DIY project and I was alarmed by what this volume left out. A DIY stairs project would be painting trimming an interior staircase, or tacking down some mats. I do not feel the book is unsafe, just grossly incomplete.Sorry, I have to rate the book at 1 star. Zero wasn't an option.Hire a licensed builder with time in rate."
5,GREAT DEAL.,"Everything was great, fast shiping, great price, and the book was like new, I'm really satizfied with this purchase, and won't hesitate to do it again. 100% garantee."
4,i wish there were a newer version,A great game. Very similar in car control feel to the real thing. I am a race driver and use it for practice sometimes.
4,Not Bad At All,I think this games is really good the only thing I think would be cool would be to add street cars like old school muscle cars other than thats its the best drag racing game I've ever played tunning can be tough but once you find the right set ups its awesome I would defiently recommend it plus its only $15
2,Not working with PS3,"The Playstaion support page shows that there are no known issues for this title on a 80gig PS3. But, I cannot get it to work. Just beware of this if you plan on playing on a 80gig PS3."
3,Not good for people using SI units but was the best avail.,"Although the book and the SAT II: Physics test stress on different things, ""How to prepare..."" is one very good book. The chapters are well developed and explained. The problems are more computational than they must be. I used that book to prepare myself but my country and many others use SI units. As you know, the Physics test also use SI units. However, I had to face constantly problems and theory concerned with English system."
3,"Short, Not a bad game!","playing this game is a pleasant surprise. It's a platformer, You play as Bruno. Your main attacks are Swinging your sword, and throwing donuts. Basically, you go through the game and fight wolves and defeat the evil wizwolf (I can't remember his real name.) This game has some humor to it. The only thing I think it suffers from is that it is a very short game. It also has a password system that almost seems unnessisary (SP) But it's worth a try."
2,This item did not fit our computer!!!,This item claim to be flexible but did not fit our computer. It is smaller than other wi-fi cards. Do some research before buying this product.
5,works great and cheap,"I bought this card a few months ago when there was a rebate going on. I installed it in Linux Mint and it was detected, automatically installed the driver and just needed to configure the SSID and password and in less than 5 minutes I got internet connection. I then also installed it on a Windows 7, but got the BSOD with the latest driver from ABIT's website. Then I googled around and found this fix""Very simple, this card is actually an atheros chipset card, simply uninstall any abit driver and install the driver for the card manually using Windows 7 default drivers under 'Network Adapters', pick either Atheros AR5006X or AR5006XS."" And now it also works in Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit."
2,Problems for XP version,"I have a COPMPAQ laptop that runs on Windows XP. The driver software i got on the CD when i purchased the wireless card had problems and so downloaded the one they have on the website, and for two months i had no problems. Once i updated my windows XP and my antivirus protection, it somehow dumped its physical memory contents (the wireless software)as though the software was never installed, and now it doesn't work at all. Every time i insert it into the laptop, the system is forced to restart itself.If there's anyone who has the same problem or know a solution, plz let me know at lsamuel@sunyrockland.edu.I guess a good buy has certain disadvantages to itself."
1,Was unable to use,"I was not able to get this card working with my Win2K laptop. I'm no novice, have configured the rest of my wireless network without any problem, and have had a friend's Netgear card working in the same system. I called tech support and after working with me they said the card was defective and to send it back, which I did. However, I had the same problem with the replacement card. So, I can't recommend this product."
1,Piece of Junk,Don't waste your money on this adapter. This wireless adapter is a piece of junk. It would not stay connected to my network for more than a few minutes even though I was sitting no more than 2 feet from my wireless router. It was connected correctly and the software was installed but it refused to stay connected to the Internet. I returned it and bought a Zonet ZEW-1505 to replace it. The Zonet works perfectly.
2,The Accelerated Learning Handbook,"The book was great, but I ahd purchased a new one and received a used one someone's name was already on the inside cover"
1,comparing lee camp and dave barry in the same breath...,"...is pure and utter sacrilege. perhaps i'm simply overexposed to lee, but i had to endure four years of his newspaper columns and his relentless attempts at proving himself SNL-worthy at UVA. lee hasn't been funny from day one.someone lent me this book, so i thankfully didn't waste any money fueling his overinflated ego.for real humour, check out gene weingarten. i IMPLORE you."
2,What?,"I love tales of King Arthur and I generally like science-fiction. Ms. Kennealy combines the two poorly. The Celts come from outer space. they have psychic powers and faster-than-light-travel. They fight with swords and spears. This probably explains why the Romans beat them... These tales are a wonderous amalgamation of a bit of reading of the poorer end of Arthuriana, New Age literature, a liberal dose of odd drugs, and a sense of light fantasy. The characters are, at times, interesting, but for the most part incomprehensible. Again, this may explain why the Romans drove them off earth..."
4,A fun book on Summer Solstice,"This book is a great collection of everything under the sun for solstice. The author really threw in a little bit of everything - ancient holiday customs, spellwork, recipes, and suggested rituals for the holiday. The sections are well marked, and well layed-out, so it's easy to flip through and find something quickly.The only downside to the material is that in covering such a mix of topics, the information is very surface, and only a smattering of sun deities and cultures get touched on. Of course this is not meant to be a dry scholarly tome, but a fun book to flip through and use. I recommend it to anyone wanting to celebrate their own SS or just read more about it."
5,"brilliant, brilliant single for Hari fans","I was fortunate to find this gem at a second hand store way back in '96.Looking at the prices on amazon I have myself a treasure to be sure. I paid $3 Australian!!!The best thing about this is the reverse end version of When We Was Fab. It not only seems to come out sounding like the original melody but there also is that sly dig at the Beatle's psychadelic period with the sitars etc.If you can find a copy grab it immediatley!!!See also my review of ""This is Love"" cd single ..."
5,Wish there were more,"I don't think I will ever get tired of Mitch Rapp. I remember when I passed Vince Flynn novels up, thinking they were just political thrillers. Now I know better. Loaded with action and great bad guys. Sitting down with one of his novels, including this one, is just a great time to spend the day. I recommend these highly to anyone who likes an action type thriller."
4,Holds your Attention,Trying to catch up on some earlier books in this series. I enjoyed this one because of its twists and turns. Good insight into the politics of running the government. Pretty hairy if it's really like this and it probably is. A few inconsistencies in the story line makes me wonder where the editors were? The main one is when they emphasized how Rapp drove his wife to work and then later in the day the assassins tracked her by finding her car in the parking garage where she worked. Left me wondering how that could be reconciled. Another plus was that he became a little more human in this one.
4,Consent to Kill,"It wasn't the best book that I have read from the author ""Vince Flynn"" but, was good and kept you intrested to keep reading to see what was going to happen next.I would recomend this book who likes books by the Author or the authors that write like he does."
5,Definitely my favorite from the series,I really enjoyed reading this story. Of course it was full of non stop action that had me completely wrapped up and stuck in this story. Best of the series!
5,One of series best,"How can I marry Mitch Rapp? He is TOO real !!! Yes, sir! Yes, he is! (Thank Heavens America does have such real patriotic, strong, good and masculine men. )"
3,Consistant with prior books in series,"As with all the Rapp series I enjoyed the book. However, the character (Mitch) appears to be becoming a dark, more emotionless killer in each of the books. The hero (?) started out as a person with extreme physical condition, driven for revenge and devotion to his country. In each of the books he has become just a little more emotionless, driven by asolute loyalty to the ""American Way"", but with little in the way of humanity or human warmth. It is becoming more difficult to identify with the Rapp as he becomes a steadly darker, less feeling killer and generaly more unlikeable."
4,Consent to Kill,I've been reading all the Mitch Rapp books and each seems to be better than the previous one. Written with credibility. It would be great if there were real people like him operating out there. Shows how terrorists use our democratic institutions to their advantage and how politicians can unwittingly assist them. Now reading the latest- Kill Shot.46Hawkeye
5,A highly recommended author,"I recently went to a lecture given by Mary Higgens Clark. She was asked who she would consider an up and coming author. When she said ""Vince Flynn"" I gave my husband the elbow and said,""See, I told you he was great! I guess I have good taste"". Advice, read his books in the order they were written. If you like the show ""24"", you'll LOVE Mr. Flynn's books. Be prepared to lose sleep because you'll be reading instead!"
2,Wrong Picture Is Shown,"The Picture is not correct. If you order by looking at the picture, you will get the wrong book. It's probably just an oversight. But, until they get the correct picture on there, be careful when ordering."
5,Consent to Kill by Vince Flynn,"I have read all the Vince Flynn books, featuring Mitch Rapp. man, once you start, you can't put them down. just be sure you read them in order. there are 12 counting the one that has not been released yet. he is a fantastic author!!!!!!!!"
3,"Good, not great...","Good ride. Interesting that humanity wins out in the end. Subtlety that could be used more often in his plots. Political ideology runs rampant and makes the stories too predictable. Most of us are more complex than that, but perhaps I/we are not the author's core audience. Generally I enjoy the research and suppositions that fall from it... There is potential here left uncovered. Good read, as were several of his others."
5,Great read!,As usual Vince Flynn keeps the reader hooked with the exploits of Mitch Rapp. You will be cheering him on at every page.
4,Consent to Kill: A Thriller,I am a big fan of Vince Flynn and MItch Rapp. Filled with lots of action and suspense. This book did not disappoint.
5,As good or better than Tom Clancy and Dale Brown,Vince Flynn's books are sequential. He's every bit as good as Tom Clancy and Dale Brown.
4,"Predictible, but a fun read","This is my 2nd Mitch Rapp book, but it was predicible, in that as soon as the reader learns that his wife is pregnant, we know without a shadow of doubt what the author plans for the wife, and ensuing actions by Mr. Rapp (what a name!)- as in ""Don't give a rapp). Also, somewhat unbelievable are the actions of the [...]'s partner after their attack on Mitch. Truly not believable in the context of prior activities of this pair. However, overall, the book was fun to read, but, please, leave his wife alone. What's next, marrying his CIA boss and becoming a step-father to her son, with whom he has bonded? That would also not be believable. Read with tongue in cheek and suspended most belief."
5,Another excellent by Vince Flynn,Vince Flynn is my favorite author and he did not disappoint me this time. Every new book he writes is better than the last.
5,Great Read,Great read and involved plot. I think this is a more mature Mitch and at the same time has other characters with depth and side plots. Well done
3,Worst in series so far,"I've been devouring the Mitch Rapp series in order. I've loved every one of them but gave Consent to Kill only 3 stars. The moral clarity of the previous books in the series is lost in this installment. Instead of single villain we get a dispersed conspiracy that isn't as satisfying. Also, Mitch's relationship with Anna is growing thin for me. Anna is merely a plot device to soften Rapp and make his decisions more complicated."
3,the ruin of Mitch Rapp,This is the last book I read in the Mitch Rapp series. The reason for this is I can no longer enjoy this character. What happened to him at the end of this book is just too much. This is taking into account the several other horrible experiences he's had in his life. He's had a tragic life and therefore his character isn't fun for me any longer.The book itself is great. And the ending is one of the best endings I've read in any book. I just think Flynn could have accomplished those same kind of emotions without adding another tragedy in Rapp's life.
2,Not what I expected,"This book was supposed to be a thrilling spy novel. Instead it was a political, IRS and personal problems thriller. So it was a dull reading if you compare it with ""The Third Option"". So if you want to read about political problems this is the book."
4,Consent to Thrill,"I had heard not so great things about this book, but I really enjoyed it. I love Mitch Rapp's take charge, get things done attitude. I hope there is someone out there working for our government that is a ""Mitch Rapp."" I was somewhat surprised by the ending but not disappointed. It was action packed."
3,Not Flynn's worst - but surely not his best either...,"I think Vince Flynn should consider a little hiatus from writing to gather together some new ideas. This one just doesn't cover much ground that he or others haven't already done better. Even Flynn's hero Mitch Rapp seems a little tired this time around, though he gets around very well for being fresh out of knee surgery - and the villains are plywood cutouts of a sinister kind. The only upside, and it's a decent one, is that the action scenes are engaging and fun, in a style that few if any can put to paper as well as this author.Sometimes it might be better not to drag out a new title just to meet that contract obligation. If you're the sort that eats the same sandwich every day and doesn't mind, maybe give Consent to Kill a read. But I recommend sticking with Flynn's Transfer of Power, Executive Power, or Mute by Brad Steel if you want fresh and different."
3,There Needs to be a New Main Character,"Vince Flynn's political/espionage series is good and I quite enjoyed Term Limits, Third Option/Separation of Power, as well as Memorial Day. Consent to Kill was a good book in terms of the political wrangling that makes the books enjoyable, but the motive of Mitch Rapp mirrored a similar type of character in Tom Clancy's Without Remorse. Thence, the next books should have other people as main characters and in terms of how I would rate Consent to Kill to all the other books Mr. Flynn wrote are as follows:Term LimitsMemorial Day (I really liked this one)Third Option/Separation of Power-(Consent to Kill had similiarities to these two books)Transfer of PowerExecutive PowerConsent to Kill"
4,Jonjdiver,"Solid storytelling . An excellent quick and fun read. Fast paced and very entertaining. If you like spy stuff, this is for you"
3,good but not the best,I like Vince flynns writing. But this is not up to par. First the character would never marry such an annoying self centered woman as Anna. Next he has trouble deciding on names. Sometimes Ross is mark sometimes hes Jonathan which is it. Who knows after a while who Carr's.
5,Best Flynn novel since 2000,"The books immediately following the 9/11 attacks seemed a bit forced to me. It was almost like Flynn was writing about Islamic extremists because of the pressure following 9/11. However, Memorial Day was a fabulous step up & Consent to Kill sealed the deal. The characters are always so real in his books. However, this particular novel was especially touching. I cried for most of the dang thing and still loved it. It's definitely my favorite so far!"
1,Very disturbing,"Since when does someone who wants to take revenge by killing his enemies have to do that by forcibly converting those enemies into living bombs? Even if they murder his Beloved Chosen, then if he wants to kill those who paid the assassins, he should do with some vague restraint, or else he is no better than they are. He could simply shoot them. But he didn't, he was ruthless and savage. The creature Mitch Rapp is nothing like my honored friend, Mr. Clancy's fictional character ""John Clark."" Mitch Rapp, by contrast, is incredibly argumentative and hostile. So he spared TWO people. From this I am to conclude that he has a soul? He is little more than a ravening beast. One should not read stories about beast-people, but rather about interesting people."
4,"Excellent, dark, disturbing","Consent to Kell is a re-read for me. I have read and love the entire Mitch Rapp series.I picked up the audiobook of CTK after reading Act of Treason in print. This one shows a darker, crueler Mitch Rapp, especially in the latter half of the book. No spoilers, but some of the later scenes in Abel's chalet were squicky--I squirmed listening to the chalet scene. This book is not for those who are into due process in their thrillers. But the ending quite made up for it."
5,An evolving Mitch Rapp,"This book was by far the best yet. I have yet to read An Act of Treason however.For the first time, I think ever, I actually was brought to tears in this story, especially the ending.Vince wrote an incredible story and gave Mitch more character than I thought he would ever have.Thanks Vince."
4,A much needed re-launch of Rapp,"Well, the previous 2 books were showing that Mitch was losing his motivation to be Dirty Harry/SuperAgent and they were mostly action and no further character building.But after this one motivation is back, I agree that the character building in this one is far greater than in the previuous books but it is not boring considering that newer and deeper motivations and games are played.At the end is predictable but nonetheless hard to put down.Vince Flynn has revived the series which was becoming dull."
3,"OK, but lacking in zing","The Rapp novel is pretty good, but lacks zing. I thought I would be enthralled, as I usually am with this genre. But not this time."
5,"MAGNIFICENT!!!!CAN""T WAIT FOR THE MOVIE!!!","Wonderful book, WE NEED a few people like MItch Rapp, one of the best developed charecter ever..Way to go Vince!"
4,Fast paced mayhem,"This Mitch Rapp story revolves around a world class French assassin, someone very much in Rapp's league, hired by a billionaire Saudi who uses as contacts a brother of the Saudi Arabian King and a murderous former East German knee breaker. The contract the Frenchman receives is to take out the formidable Mr. Rapp.Rapp becomes aware of the plot after he suffers a horrible personal tragedy at the hands of the assassin. The pay back, merciless as always, is vintage Rapp. The ending was a surprise to me and perhaps a bit out of character for Rapp.A fine story, well told."
3,What A Disappointment,"I have read all of Vince Flynn's previous books and am definitely a fan. I was eagerly awaiting this book, and was very disappointed. There is no suspense (except for one terrible incident), and the plot is very predictable. Perhaps it's time for Flynn to retire Mitch Rapp and develop another character. I'm sorry to say that I won't read another Mitch Rapp book. (sigh)"
4,I love a good thriller,"This is a very good book.I am the author of Domestic Abuse All Sides, Domestic Abuse Our Stories and Murder in New England & Closing the Circle"
3,Islamic apologetic pabulum,"Vince Flynn Mitch Rapp novels are Islamic apologetic pabulum , they are the heart and soul of modern pulp fiction, If you are able to detect the islomoplogetics in ""24"" you now know where to comes from , the mind of Flynn whose knowledge of Islamic scripture is as deep as piss on a hot rock in the sun. They are entertaining for the most part , but irritating , he prints the CAIR party line. If his knowledge of the ""inner workings"" of anything are equal to his Quranic knowledge you wont be getting much for but a fun read, no insight, His story line wouldn't suffer if he just didn't offer his opinion about Islam alleged hijacking."
3,"bought for husband, read in less than 1 week",I did not read the book myself but my husband loved it. The shipment came very quickly.
3,Weird,"This book had some cool magic and demonology in it, but most of it just didn't make sense. As one other reviewer said I am kind of in a love/hate relationship with it. The biblical references and the magic and the demons and darkness was so compelling, but much of the time i found myself completely lost. There was so much backstory I feel I missed half the plot. I thought there might be a prequel to this but it seems not- we just come into a half-finished story. I kept shaking my head about to give up on it then it started to get really cool, then just as I really began to enjoy it, it got incomprehensible again. Hard to rate it, really. I don't know if I will read anything else by this author, even though I have five or six of his other books on kindle."
1,This book SUCKS!,I read lots of horror and have never posted a review but wow this book sucked. Hopefully this will stop some of you from wasting your time.
5,A horror lover's delight,"Some people might think this one is more ""dark fantasy"" than pure outright ""horror"" do to all the magical and occult elements to the story, but this story is truly a chilling one. A Lower Deep is broken into three sections and each one tells a separate story of how the nameless narrator and his demon companion Self get into big trouble with both the forces of good and evil. Like religion itself, all of the characters in this novel are conflicted over exactly what is right and wrong, and which ""evils"" might be a part of hell's greater plan or God's. The ending is an outright stunner involving the Archangel Michael, the possible resurrection of Christ, and the prophecies of Revelation (including the Red Dragon). An exceptional novel."
4,This is great for beginners!,"If you like hacky sack, but have no idea how to play it, or how to kick the hacky sack well, then get this book. Like I said before in the title, this is great for beginners. A hacky sack comes with it for FREE! However, I was disappointed how it didn't cover any of the advanced kicks."
3,Well written guidebook,"I am curently a student at Gallatin High School, where i am engaged in an Advanced Placement American History class. I have found this book to be beneficial in helping me study. Although i would have liked it to review the chapter more rather than only having questions on the reading. Overall this book is a good study tool for taking an American History class. NOTE this book will be useless if you do not have the textbook."
1,You can't tell a book by its cover,"If you are interested in the aporyphal acts of the apostles then you should look elsewhere because this book contains little about that subject. What the book does contain is a collection of esoteric writings concerning the study of the apocryphal acts of the apostles. For example, the first real ""chapter"" of the book is a 35 page description of how the major editor, Francois Bovon, researched the apocryphal acts of the apostle Philip. He assures the reader that he will soon publish the subject of his research, the actual acts of Philip, in another book. The rest of the book is similar containing summaries of PhD desertations concerning the research of the apocryphal acts and very little description of the actual acts. Imagine my disappointment when I received the book and the content had little of what the title promised. I must look elsewhere. Shame on you Harvard Divinity School."
4,Excellent Conspectus of Approaches to Apocryphal Acts,"This book is not intended to be an introduction to apocryphal literature and those who are looking for such a thing will no doubt be as disappointed as the other reviewers. Rather, this book is an excellent collection of essays illustrating various approaches to apocryphal acts, and would be best used after one had a good grounding in the already published apocryphal acts. The two previously unpublished acts (of Saint John and Ananias) included in this book are well introduced, edited, and have a full textual apparatus."
1,Steamed!,"I paid...for a book about the apocryphal acts of the apostles and this book contains not one. If a book says it is about something, it should be about that subject not someone else's interpretations of it. After reading it I found that I would have to go to the Harvard Library to see the manuscripts to go along with the book. Do not buy this book."
1,Never received my order.,I have not received this book yet. I also have not received several CD's I had ordered. Where are they? The only CD I've received so far is Susan Boyle's new CD. Please track my orders.
5,Very Informative,This book is one of the most informative books I've ever read on diabetes. Very informative and definitely recommend.
4,Solid and reliable,"A prime source of information about Lincoln's last law partner, including Herndon's political activities. Not a lively read, but an informative one. The author, who wrote this book in the 1940s, became one of the most admired Lincoln scholars."
4,"Immediate difference, but with horrible smell","The conditioner does a great job on dry, fine hair. I could tell the difference the first time I used it. My hair felt softer and healthier, but not weighed down or product-y. I think it even improved the sheen of my dishwater-brown hair. Good stuff, yeah?However, the conditioner smells really horrid. I mean, just terrible. It hits you as soon as you open it. Wow! That's bad. It fades after a while, of course, but the odor ruins the zen of my showering experience."
3,A Good Nemo is Hard to Find,"This book is one of the few that I can find about Nemo. Also, the pictures are beautiful and reminiscent of the movie. However, the content of the book itself is a little lame. My two year old was still thrilled to see and own a Nemo book; so that's what really matters."
4,Good balance,"This is, IMHO, a good book. It has a lot of background info about the Silver Marches (as one would expect) and some playing info too - although I feel that the book would be better without the statistics and profiles. I specially like how it describes the politics of the Silver Marches. I think it is also nice that it includes 4 short adventures.It has some caveats, though. Sometimes the book feels a bit childish (but not too much), and some of the descriptions are too short - well, that leaves room for imagination anyway, so it is not such a important problem.All in all, I think it is a good book, but not a perfect one."
2,"great product, no map","no mention was made of there not being a map included. A product can't be ""like new"" without something as crucial as that."
1,Silly and tedious,"I do not understand the notoriety of this book. My initial impression after 20 pages: The fictional character depicted here is a self-absorbed neurotic. That impression solidified after 100 pages. Repeatedly, the ""protagonist"" puts himself down , then self-exults in the same paragraph. He is clueless, but imagines his boring blather is ironic and honest. How subtle. Tedious junk no matter how you cut it."
5,Fascinating,"I don't give many 5 star reviews, but this book blew me away. The writing is top notch. The story is incredibly sad, though. It tells the story of a fictional b-movie actor trying to get by after his star has lost it's shine - kind of like The Wrestler except about Hollywood actors."
3,Not Complete,"This was not a bad book. Only I felt at times things were missing or left out. I would of LOVED to of learned the the true indentity of ""Jesse"" for example, that part was disapointing. I was under the impression he was a cousin of John Travolta's. Apparently I was incorrect because no mention of him was made. Through the book at times was a bit colorful, I hardly found it shocking, or risque. I was hoping for more 'name-dropping"" and details, it is hardly a scandalous book. The part concerning his Mother was heart-breaking through, and I felt much sympathy for him. Not a dull read but not as entertaining as thought!"
5,An antidote to the bad taste of stage-Irishness.,"This artist is in her thirties and comes from Dublin.For the past fifteen years she has been attached to various opera companies in Germany,particularly Munich.It would be hard to encounter a singer whoes presence is more alive or whoes ability to draw one in to the essence of the music is so immediate.This is great music.John MacCormack spoke of those songs as having ""uplifted mens' hearts through centuries"".So much Irish music is contorted by sheer bad taste.It takes a real sense of the discipline of a classical training to give those numbers their due.In the American pianist Donald Sulzen the producers of this disc have also uncovered a master.His feeling for the line of the music and the sense of the words perfectly matches that of Frances Lucey even in the couple of songs which she sings in the Irish language.A real gem!"
5,Comfort and femininity!,Floats like a cloud and feels delicious! Perfect for Winter or Summer and you'll feel like a queen! I don't know when I would find a prettier or more comfortable gown! Treat yourself today!
2,Desperate for a Nightgown,"This nightgown is as advertised, but still disappointing in that the fabric is very thin and transparent. However, I kept it as real silk or silk-like gowns seem to have gone out of fashion in the last decade. What happened to Oscar de la Renta and Natori?"
2,Over-rated product,"Word Menu 2.2 offers quickly accessible words, however the defintions are vague and indirect. Many words you would expect to find are missing, and frankly this is a program that would be most useful for people learning the english language,seeking to understand genres which certain words pertain to. It is my opinion that most english speakers already have a strong grasp on most of these words and subjects they entail; buying this for any trivial benefit of searching words by subjects, is foolhardy. It's not worth 30 dollars, I wish I would not have purchased it and do not reccomend it. If the price was 15 dollars or less, I would suggest ""hey why not"". $30 is an unreasonable price for this simplistic vocabulary lexicon and is more wisely spent on something else."
1,"Non-existent support, passable product","I've used Word Menu since it came out, and although it does what it says, it does little more. I did find it useful for taking my brain for a jog with related words and concepts, especially when you're deep in other thoughts while writing. It serves a good purpose there--but frankly so does a good thesaurus.Sadly, the publisher, Screenplay.com, fails when it comes to maintaining compatible versions with popular operating systems--in particular Mac OS X Lion. From their own website:Last updated: Jul-12-2011Currently, Word Menu is not compatible with Mac OS 10.7 (Lion). As of the posting of this article, we are hoping to have Word Menu re-compiled to be fully Mac OS X 10.7 compatible soon . That process WILL correct the problem.""The problem"" is that the program does not even open, much less work at all in Lion. Stick with your thesaurus."
2,not for serious writers,"I would recommend this product for kids, middle school age maybe, but not for anyone looking for a real thesaurus to use with their computer. It will bring up a few interesting alternatives for any given word, but misses many of the most obvious ones. It's not very useful."
1,Garbage,"This software is garbage. After the install, it asks that you restart your system. Then when you click on the shortcut on the desktop after the restart, the whole machine goes black and the systems recovers from a ""serious error"" Needless to say it was unistalled immediately. Save your money and use an internet dictionary or thesaurus."
2,7 months later piece of trash :),"Great Item to have! My computer is about 8 years old windows xp Intel Pentium 4 and it fit like a glove. Installation was easy and no difficulties. JUST FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS. What I did was install the drivers first, then shut down the computer and insert the pci card in the pci slot turned computer backed on and click on the icon on the right task bar and choose which network you want to connect.8/6/11 *UpdateI purchased several months ago. Its starting to bottom out I would lose connections, slow connections if it does work or sometimes no connections Id would have to restart my computer and hope it works kinda of to get by. Great product affordable but sucks in the reliability part."
1,JUNK,This card worked for a while. Now it will consistently drop the internet for no apparent reason. I thought it was my router but all my other computers remain connected. Even restarts sometimes does not get it back. DO NOT BUY. Would not recommend to anyone. Mine is going to the landfill.
1,Waste of money. It's better just to set your money on fire.,"I got this item and it worked fine for quite sometime, but now when I try to use it, it won't connect to the wireless access point. I tried reinstalling Windows but it was still acting up."
1,"Wow, really? Why did I ignore the 1 star reviews...","This is a lousy wifi adapter. I barely got to this page on it. Terrible range; my laptop does fine and my router is at the other end of my whole-floor brownstone apartment, that's probably over 70 ft away with 2 plaster walls in between. 4 bars consistently. This can rarely get above 2 bars. Constantly loses connection - cancelled downloads ahoy! Vague, confusion instructions. Nothing but a waste of time. Do not buy. Especially if you were trying to use it on Windows 7 like me. There are 64-bit adapters available. I am returning this as it is effectively broken, and trying one of those."
1,"TrendNet is a great price, but connection too unstable","I recently purchased one of these cards and have been sadly unhappy.ProsPriceInstallationConsConnection drops at least 2x daily requiring a repair or reboot.Drops on continuous usage. For example, can't copy more than 200 Meg across network without it dropping once.I know the problem is not my network as I have two other laptops and have had at least 10 guests on my network with no problems. Also, the machine is about 10ft from the router so I know it is not the signal strength.Seems to work reasonably for intermittent use on document surfing. But once you get into streaming music or video it falls on its face. I'm heading back to hardwire...."
4,Almost Excellent,"Easy to install and the latest driver is available on line. Signal strength is 'good' to 'very good' , but rarely excellent. I would rate this card excellent were it not for the signal strength.bjs"
2,Uncertain,I purchased it refurbished and when I received it it did not work. I returned it. Was it a poor design or was it just one of those items that comes off the assembly line (and every product line has this problem) that just doesn't work right...I don't know which.
3,Just OK for the price,Set up can be a bit challenging and signal strength isn't great. Definitely consult the manual (unfortunately badly written) for set-up as 'intuition' might not work.3.5 stars because of the price
2,You get what you pay for . . .,"I purchased this wireless card based on the price, figuring that even if it didn't live up to the good reviews here, I would only be out ~$20. The set up was easy and smooth, but the card won't stay connected to my wireless network. I've got a Belkin wireless router. The Trendnet signal meter generally shows ~95% signal strength, but the connection only lasts for a few minutes, and I have to keep cycling the connection to regain network access--very annoying. I know there's nothing wrong with the network because my laptop's connection is stable. I purchased a D-Link card, and it has worked flawlessly. Unfortunately, I threw away the packaging when the Trendnet card arrived; if I hadn't, then this card would be on its way back to Amazon now. Like the title of my review says: you get what you pay for . . . ."
1,Junk,Other people have given this product positive reviews. I can't. After installing the software (drivers) on my Windows 2000 computer I installed the board and the computer would not boot at all. I received a replacement from Amazon (which could not have been easier) and the computer would boot with the new board installed but recognized the board as an Ethernet card and would not recognize the drivers at all. Called the technical help line (in India) and they were totally useless. I would not recommend this product.
1,Either DOA or has driver issues - I sent this baby packing!,"I needed a wireless adapter fairly fast and wanted to keep the price low - so I turned to Amazon and went with this model. What a dissapointment!Now I know computers - I have a degree in this field for pity sakes, so I know what I am doing when installing an item like this. Regardless, it never worked. Troubleshooting was useless.Thankfully Amazon handled the return quickly. Thumbs up for Amazon - thumbs down for Trendnet."
1,Trendnet,Horrible! I still haven't received this product or a refund - I have sent the seller 3 emails w/no reply. I want a refund ASAP! I am VERY dissatisfied!!
3,Don't get too excited,Decent manual and installation process but I'm still going to have to buy a repeater to get a decent wireless signal to the desktop in which the Trendnet adapter is installed.
4,simple and great card,"hardware installation of this card took 3 minutes including opening and closing computer case.Software installation took even less time than hardware. No drivers required for Windows XP Media Center Edition SP2 but disk is included if you want to load third party utility to manage this card. Windows itself will manage this card.for WinXP Home or Pro SP2 you need to insert driver disk in to CDROMand Windows will find it. But after the next Windows Update, Windows will load updated driver for this card from Microsoft website and replace the supplied driver.In general this card works fine without any problems. It finds all wireless networks around your PC including B and G."
2,Would probably not buy another one..,"The main issue I had with this was setting up the WEP connection link back to my Linksys router. Trendnet gives you a ""false"" signal strength (bars icon) UNTIL you actually make the WEP connection back to the router. Once you enter the WEP key and connect, the signal shows strong- go figure?In the meantime, I was moving my router around the house, playing with the antenna on the Trendnet, etc thinking this was the problem. If you're not in a hurry and have a few hours to spare connecting your PC to your wireless router- then this product is for you!"
1,Frequent dropped connection,The connection drops if the internet activity stops and does not connect until you restart the computer. All this with great reception. Extremely unreliable product.
1,FAJ,"NEVER Buy anything from PCI MIRCO!!!!!!!!!!!! NEVER!!!!! AMAZON SHOULD NOT LET SELL FROM THERE SITE!!!!!!!!!!!! product didn't work, so I sent it back for refund or to replace the non working card. I'm happy to tell anyone out there that PCI MIRCO sent the same broken card back!!!!!! NEVER!!!! buy anything from PCI MIRCO!!!!!!!NEVER"
2,bad signal detecting,1-disconnect every 5min comparing to my wireless notebook which is continously working where both reciving from the same router that mean the problem is not in the router as I thought befor2-very low signal detecting where the distance is about 10m in open area (less than bluetooth rang...loool)3-pay some more bucks and get mimo adapter
1,Won't work,"Despite hours of effort and my B.S. in computer science, I can't get this card to work with Windows ME. It will occasionally work for 3-4 minutes and then it doesn't work for hours. I downloaded the newest driver and utility but still no luck. I'll be looking for a new card."
1,BSOD condition,"I don't have objective evidence, but I suspect this hardware driver has compatibility problems with some systems, i.e., HP dc5700 minitower running Windows XP. My system has a bluetooth adapter enabled. I devoted 3-4 hours to trying to get it to work, thought I had it, then I got the dreaded blue screen of death(again) for the last time. The mfgr support would only tell me to reinstall, which is par, but which did not provide a solution. I'm sending it back."
1,Locks up my computer,"It took me a while to understand this card was the source of my computer freezing every few seconds, but noticing that Metatrader 4 sounded a disconnect alarm during the freeze-up made it obvious. Repairing my wireless connection would get rid of it for a variable amount of time, but it always returned. I tried everything Trendnet suggested, I even reinstalled Windows XP, (which gave me a nice clean fast new installation free of all the junk I had accumulated!) but nothing helped. I'm buying a new card, probably the Super G 802.11BG Wireless Pci 64 Bit Xp Compliant Turbo Mode by MSI, since it has the best reviews."
2,abysmal performance for uploading!,"This product works fine when surfing the web, or watching movies off the internet, eg, from abc, fox, etc.However, when you try to upload to flickr/smugmug, the performance is so spotty, that you would rather strangle yourself than try to use this to upload! It is near to impossible to upload more than 10 photos consecutively.I would stay far away from this poor excuse of engineering. More information on my usage, I'm using this with vista.BEWARE!"
1,Trendset 54Mbps Wireless G PCI Adapter TEW-423PI,"This card has been a huge disappointment. It would drop my Internet connection at intervals from a few seconds to a few minutes. I replaced it with the Linksys WMP54G, and all problems have been solved.Maybe I had a defective card, but the sales person where I bought it did say this card was prone to drop-offs. Stupidly, I didn't believe him, because the price was lower than the Linksys."
3,Cheap. Pain to install. Use the Realtek Driver,"It created a software error when I installed it - ""Microsoft Kill Process Utility"" created a fault. I uninstalled the supplied software and downloaded the software from the chip manufacturer - Realtek RTL8185L. Unzip the file to a temporary folder, install the card. Tell windows that you want to install from a specific location and browse to the folder. It will install the drivers, and then you can use the standard windows wireless manager to take care of connecting to your network. Driver can be found at Realtek's site. I also went into device manager and turned off the Let Windows Turn Off this Device to Save Power function.Seems to work better now, but still drops off unexpectedly..."
5,Works,"I couldn't get my Belkin wireless adapter to work on this particular computer, so I purchased the Trendnet device. It was easy to install, doesn't take up a usb port since it's built in, and it works fine. It was inexpensive too, so a great solution. I'd buy it again over other devices for the same purpose."
1,Piece of Junk,"I was a little skeptical when I bought this, and for good reason. It locks up the network connection after about 15 minutes of use. I tried 3 different drivers and about 15 different configurations, using XP Home and a NetGear router. Ended up spending $16 on a NetGear USB wireless adapterNETGEAR WG111US Wireless-G USB 2.0 Adapterand it's worked absolutely flawlessly."
4,Works great,"I bought this card for my new Dell XPS system running Windows XP. It took me a little while to getthis card set up on my system--perhaps due to my excitement to get my computer connected to my homenetwork and the Internet. But once the card was operational, it did a very nice job. I was happy withthe network performance. I bought this card together with a Linksys WRT54GL router and theywork with each other as I'd hoped.The price of this card is a bargain.The only reason I'm not giving this card 5 stars is that the manual could have been more helpful.I ended up figuring things out on my own. I have another PC which needs a new network cardand I'll buy this same card again."
3,Works... but tricky to setup,"This card worked after two tries. In my first attempt I installed it in a PC running Windows XP and installed the software that came with it. For whatever reason, I could get a signal, but could never get out to the Internet. I eventually took it out of the PC, put it in a different one and did NOT install the software that came with it. Instead, I let Windows do its thing. That worked."
4,This one works great.,A little bit weak in picking up the signal compared to my notebook built-in adapter. But it might be because an extra wall between the router and this adapter. Then I realized that a USB wireless adapter could be easier to install.
1,Locks up your computer. Incompatible with Windows or Ubuntu.,"I tried this card with Ubuntu and Windows XP SP3. Both have the same issue. The system will begin cycling, attempting to connect to your wireless network over and over, even after it has been connected awhile. This will cause your system to lock up and freeze for 2-10 seconds periodically. Eventually your system will hard freeze completely or just reboot itself.Unfortunately this behavior is well known online. This card will definitely not work on Windows XP SP2 or newer (XP SP3, Vista, Windows 7). Check out a simple Google search for ""RTL8185L freeze."" RTL8185L is the chip on this card, at least the latest series as purchased from here. I'm posting a link to one such forum: [...]As others have written: avoid this card like the plague. The only way to get your system working again is to uninstall everything, pull the card out of your computer, and go ""Office Space""-style on it in the backyard with a baseball bat."
1,TRENDnet wireless adapter TEW-423PI,"The software for this adapter was not compatable with windows XP, but I loaded it anyway and had serious software issues as a result. I couldnt even delete this software from my computor. My computor will have to be reformatted it order to make it workable again. My son tried loading the software into his windows vista computor. It was supposed to be compatable with windows vista, but he had serious problems also.TRENDnet 54Mbps Wireless G PCI Adapter TEW-423PI"
1,Incredibly poor quality!,"The Trendnet TEW-432PI (B1 build) is an incredibly poor quality piece of hardware. I have tried multiple methods to get it to maintain a consistent signal or at least stay connected to my router (which is less than 25 feet away through a wall) more than 10 minutes to no avail. I have tried to use the latest drivers, use the bundled software, change my router's channel signal, use WCZ to override the bundled software and connect via Windows XP's own methods, etc. and nothing has managed to get this card to work.It is completely unreliable, and technical support is absolutely worthless and rude. I would rather pay 5x the price and buy something reliable. Don't waste your time, or even the small amount of money you will spend to pull your hair out and end up returning this wireless adapter. 0 stars for a terrible experience."
1,Not worth the money,"I purchased this PCI card because it was cheap. I admit that. Sadly, that is exactly what I got, a cheap, poor quality card. It consistently had trouble with the Wifi signal in my home when other computers did not. It dropped the connection all the time and then wouldn't pick it back up, so that I had to reboot the computer to get back online. The software that comes with it disables the standard Windows XP login, so instead you have to type in your username and cannot have two users logged in at the same time. Finally, after about 6 months it just stopped working altogether. Honestly, I'm glad to get rid of it. I bought a much more expensive Linksys wireless card to replace it and am much happier."
4,A Cheap Wireless Card,"You usually get what you pay for and this product does not contradict that. I had a USB wireless adapter that got a very low signal. My laptop gets an excellent signal from the exact same spot. I got this card in hopes it would improve my reception. It is better and data transfer is faster, but it is still receiving a low signal. I feel I got what I paid for (and that's not a bad thing)."
1,Not worth the money,"I bought this card for a Dell desktop when i setting up a wireless network in my house. Installing the wireless card into the computer wasn't that difficult and installing the drivers/software was a fairly painless process. However, the card had very poor reception and only detected a very weak signal and would continually lose the signal all together. Moving the antenna around did not increase the signal strength appreciably. Even when the wireless router was placed about 10 feet from the computer (with no obstructions between the card and the router), it still did not show the strongest signal possible. Thus, I would so don't buy this card as it is a waste of money."
5,Problems with loading the drivers,"On one of my computers installing this, I ran into trouble loading the program. It kept giving me the microsoft error message of death. I ended up uninstalling the program and just using the plug and play feature, and when windows wants to install drivers just have the CD inserted and let it auto load. Works like a champ now."
1,Unhappy,"Beware.While this device does connect to the router under XP, it does so at the expense of user switching as well as the welcome screen. To make a bad situation worse, once the setup utility has run for the first time, it expires thereafter, causing ""Kill Utility"" errors on startup and (occaisionally) on shutdown.All the King's reinstalls and downloads cannot save this defective product."
2,piece of crap!,"I was looking for an inexpensive card for my desktop to avoid running network cable to my router. Installation was smooth and easy. Problems had started when I tried to connect to wireless router. It is only 10 feet away from the card's antenna in straight line and the signal has only 2 bars! Then I moved my desktop to the other side of my desk and the router as close as I could. Now I have 3, sometimes 4 bars.I decided to buy a traditional cable.I'm giving 2 stars only because it works and installs with any problems. Definitely not worth a penny. Stay away and spend your money for a better card."
1,BAD,"This item does not work at all. Even with my computer setting beside the computer with the router,It says the network im trying to connect with is out of range. And to think I paid this monies on a product i cannot use."
1,Not the choice for me,"I'll happily admit I bought on price. Wireless-G cards should be a commodity product by now. This card will not work with the XP wireless utility and requires its own driver utility to be installed. That would be OK, but when you do that on an XP machine, it kills your multiple user welcome screen and fast user switching.I did get it up and running, but the driver application seemed to crash frequently and hence the connection was lost, with no guarantee it would return without a reboot. This frustrated my wife and family a lot so the card has to go.Until Trend fix the software, I could not recommend this product."
1,"If you buy this, you are testing your luck","I already return this. It is nightmare to get this piece of stuff work. There have been a bunch of people online waiting for help desperately. And the official haven't given a solution for them.I am sure there are portion of people can get it works without any problem (see the other reviews), so I am saying that you are playing the dice.my os is Vista."
1,LAN connection keep dropping,"After the driver installed, bootup my XP takes 5 mins, before one half a min.Also Internet connection is fine but can't see other PC (LAN) all the time.This min ok, try again, can't connect....."
2,No muy buena,"No funciona como esperaba, muy poco alcance, talvez para equipos en un mismo espacio u habitacion."
4,Easy to install. No problems...yet...,"I was suspect about going with such a cheap product, but did so after reading the reviews. I found the product very easy to install and working just fine. I did have some problem between the driver with Microsoft XP. The driver is not ""approved"" by Microsoft and introduces a minor problem. It seems that I cannot use XP's personal profiles because of this. A bit of an irritant, but not a show stopper."
1,Poor Quality,"I sent this card back the day after I got it. First of all, the enclosed software would not install properly on my XP machine. Perhaps I got a bad copy of the CD. Seems unlikely. I ended-up running the card straight through windows but the speed fluctuated and was constantly slow. Calling customer service was a waste of time. No phone number is given in the manual so I had to go online using my laptop and get it. I waited on hold for more than half an hour and finally gave up. I was attracted to this product by the price and other users seem to have success with it. I did not. My advise, don't gamble on this one, spend a little more money, and get a quality product."
2,Has a horrible transfer rate,For some reason it has a excellent connection but a transfer rate of 5.5 mbps and it kept dropping connections. I have a crummy laptop next to it that gets a better signal and strength then this card. I tried playing games on the internet with this and it contently dropped my signal. And no its not my router everything else i own is fine.
4,Nice Price - Nice Product,Very easy to intall for a non tech kinda guy - just follow the instructions. web connection has been fine - no problems.
1,"Awful, Inaccurate","This scale gives you about 5 different readings constantly. And they are always WAY off. Very disappointed in this product. HoMedics is usually a good, trustworthy brand. Stay away from this scale."
5,no problems with mine in eight years,"I purchased this at BB&B; over eight years ago and have never had trouble of any kind with it. And believe me it has gotten a workout! It is consistent and the battery lasts forever in it. The display is easy to read. The only time I ever get an ""error"" is if I move around to much while it is reading my weight.I am just now buying a replacement for it. I am buying another of these same scales."
4,Great Scale,"Its nothing fancy, but the price is good, it works well and looks very sleek in my bathroom."
1,Only buy if you want frustration!,"This scale is flat-out terrible! There is a five star review on here that says that you just have to wait for the scale to ""zero out"" before stepping on it. Unfortunately, half the time the scale won't zero out and will just drop to an arbitrary number before doing its stupid ""close out to error"" mode. It's extremely frustrating- especially if you don't want to spend 5 minutes weighing yourself and then leave wondering whether the correct weight was given (it likes to vary- I just weighed myself and had a variance of EIGHT POUNDS). Oh- and you supposedly can calibrate the scale by applying pressure and allowing it to cycle through its modes- believe me this never works and you always get an error message. PLEASE PLEASE save yourself the frustration and don't buy this horrible product!"
1,error,I just got this scale in the mail after ordering it online. I did exactly what the instructions asked and it doesn't work. Just reads error and nothing else.
1,extremely erratic,"Weigh yourself five times in five minutes and you get five completely different readings, with a variance of as much as 4 (yes four!) pounds between highest and lowest. A bad deal at any price."
1,inconsistant,"When I first bought this scale from Sears, I weight myself 4-5 times within 2 minutes and every single reading was different by as much as 3 lbs. Needless to say, I returned it."
5,Acurate,Purchased for myself and for my mother- in -law.Large numbers on a digital display easy to read.Sleak design.
1,Dud,"Like other reviewers, we also found this scale to give inconsistent, widely-varying readings. It is just a waste of money."
5,This squirrel guard really works.,"We had a Droll Yankee squirrel guard for years, but finally the plastic wore out and broke. I replaced it with a locally available substitute and the squirrels are delighted. They have been feasting on our birdseed ever since. The birds come only after the squirrels are gone. Follow the instructions in placing your pole, so that the pole is far enough away from plants or objects which allow the squirrels to jump onto the bird feeder above the squirrel guard and the squirrels will not be able to reach your bird seed. The plastic clips that hold the guard on the pole will eventually break, but mine lasted for over 4-5 years before doing so. They are easily replaced. This guard is effective and worth the extra price."
2,Product Description Wrong!,"This does not fit a 1"" pole! Beware! Its center hole has a diameter of 7/8"" [clearly printed on box], and so obviously can't fit a pole larger in diameter than that! It will not fit a Wild Birds Unlimited 1"" pole [as I found out the hard way]. Obviously, Droll Yankees want to limit their customers to using their [less sturdy/stable] pole only - a pity. This product is going back."
3,Droll Yankees 18.5 inch Squirrel Guard,"Rather disappointing, as several squirrels have climbed the pole and managed to get over the guard, starting from the ground. My prior Droll guard evidently was better designed as, in 22 years, never had such a problem (am still using it on another feeder). I emailed Droll about this and they did not respond."
1,Horrible Table Set,"If you value your children and their safety then stay away from this cheap table. First off it isn't even made of solid natural wood. It is made of a very cheap card board like pressed wood. We bought this for our little girl and it only lasted less than 2 months. If your children plan to use it once in a while then maybe it is worth it for show. It does look very pretty. But if you plan to have your Children use it in a daily basis like mine then keep away. Children need something sturdy (solid real wood, plastic etc.) so please keep away."
1,Buyer beware~~quality is terrible.,"As the mother of four girls (three now teens) I have seen my share of toys. This table set is absolutely adorable to look at, however it is very poorly made. The table did not last a month at my house. My youngest daughter is mild mannered with her toys and has many that are wonderful. I would advise that you look at Kidkraft as every item we have ever bought from that company has held up for years with a lot of play. I was disappointed with this set the table legs are not designed correctly and they fall off. The chair slats are glued on and they too did not hold up. Good luck and I hope this review helps someone."
1,Disintegrates upon using,"The table legs won't stay on, it's made of MDF and is very hard to repair, the chair slats came off leaving sharp exposed staples - this is expensive garbage. I'm disappointed because I live in a rural area and it's hard to find another one that will ship here (not to mention what I'm going to have to pay to get a different product shipped). My husband is a builder - he has built entire buildings from the ground up for twenty years and can't get this table to stay together. If it had cost less it would hurt less to throw it away after having it such a short time, but this is a lot of money for garbage."
5,Great Product!!,"This table and chair set is exactly what we wanted for our 16 month old. The quality is good, and it was easy to assemble. Most of all the chairs are sturdy enough to support our little climber! I would definitely recommend this product."
3,Table,"I ordered this table for my 2 year old daughter. The value and quality are very good. One of the seat slats came off but I used a small finishing nail to put it back on and no problems so far ! It is a very good table for the price,,,"
3,package not checked before shipping,"The table and chairs are exactly as they appear in photo...However, since they are manufactured in China they are not checked for problems before shipping. The table had a large chip in corner and two of the chair spindles had cracks. Since it was my grand daughter's birthday I did not have time to return. I used some pink paint and stickers to cover faults."
4,"Excellent book, but lacking some","This is a very thorough and well-written book about the Palestinians of what used to be Ein Houd. It has one big weakness-- the title is misleading. It is about Palestinians working to keep the memory of their old village alive, not Jews. There isn't a whole lot about the Jews who now live in Ein Houd (now called Ein Hod), which is a problem. Also, you should know before buying this book that it's not about the Israeli Palestinian conflict, it's just a case study of one village. Having said that, though, the research is amazing. It covers the history, politics, literature, art, customs, and the new homes of Ein Houd's Palestinians. If you already know a lot about the conflict and aren't looking for a general overview but for a detailed example, this is definitely the book for you."
5,A great read,"The value of this book is the simple albeit not so scholarly observations of the author. Reading it one feels like someone encountering with both curiosity and a bit of fear, new territory. Sure the historical or even common sense elements may be missing here and there, but it's the westerner sharing from western eyes, two world views that proves invaluable. Few authors who serve in third world areas like Pakistan and Afghanistan, ever write about the dizziness of returning to the United States where even the poor live in splendor compared to third world people. And I appreciate the authors reminder to me a woman from the United States, that I am spoiled and really have no idea what true oppression is all about. And as a side note I appreciate the authors love of animals in need."
2,They are smaller than what is available at best buy,Had to use make the wire smaller so it would fit in the connector plug no good for heavy speaker wire
5,One of the best in the field,This book is an invaluable source for anyone studying multicultural lit. or environmental lit. It is an excellently researched book. It is fair in its treatment of the subject matter and an important work that brings postcolonial theory onto American soil.
5,professor of literature,"After reading the previous review, I feel that I have to respond. First of all, this ""graduate student of literature""could not have read the same book I did. Dreese repeatedly talks about the diversity of native cultures, and there is nothing ""colonialist"" about her book. What I love about this work is that Dreese allows the authors to speak for themselves, rather than speaking for them. She illuminates their marvelous talents. She directly quotes critics who talk about the inaccuracy of the ""post"" in postcolonial, and agrees fully with their theories. There is no suggestion anywhere in her book of a monolithic culture, and Dreese fully debunks any suggestion of one. Furthermore, this ""graduate student of literature"" needs to do a lot more research: It's Sherman Alexie. Not Alexie Sherman!"
3,"Fun and Creative, but lacks good menu interface","This is a great gym ball workout. Two separate workouts: beginers and intermediate. Very upbeat and creative and ends with some great stretching at the end of each workout.Like the other Healthy Living DVD I have, it lacks a good menu interface. I would give this 4 stars if you could pick the section of the workouts....you have to run it from beginning to end. The search will not even take you to the next section. The menus include a choice for French or English and 2 workout options and that's it....See my other reviews on Amazon for fitness DVDs"
2,"A ""Must-Not-See"" film",Clifton Powell is too good an actor for this trashy excuse for a film. Don't waste your time unless thats all you're trying to do. I'd suggest you read a book instead. I'm sure your imagination could do a better job than the folkes who put this mess together did.
4,Showing its age,"Yes, it's a classic. Yes, every computer scientist MUST own it. But enormous significant progress has been made in the field of NP-completeness (and computational complexity more generally) in the two decades since this book was published. An up-to-date edition -- which would probably be well over a thousand pages long -- has been badly needed for years."
5,comprehensive book for NP-completeness,The book is excellent in explaining NP-completeness problem. Take it as a reference if you would like to do research in this field.
5,Jam-packed little book,"This book is a handy size to keep close at hand. Although it is small it is loaded with an abudance of information. I keep my copy handy at all times, at work as well as at home. Anyone that uses this program can benifit from this handy guidebook."
3,"Dated Presentation, Hard To Follow","I purchased this title hoping to find a book to give to young men contemplating God's call to pastoral ministry. I was disappointed in what I found. The author does not present clear lines of thought, and tends to ramble in places where a brief summary would be more in order. The book is clearly dated with an overly ""clerical"" tone that would be unfamiliar to a person considering ministry. The use of the King James Version for Scriptural references would also be a distraction for younger readers.Still, there are some good points scattered throughout the book that make it worth the reading for an older minister working with ministerial candidates. For the candidates themselves, however, an easier-to-read, more modern presentation would be much more useful. My search for a small book providing a helpful summary for God's call to ministry continues."
3,Meh.,"This is a competent book on Computer Science, but just about any introductory CS textbook will cover these topics and many more. If you are familiar with other Schaum's outlines, you'll probably know what to expect. The price is no doubt much lower than most CS textbooks, so this book certainly is justified in certain cases. Nothing terrible in here, but also nothing terribly exciting or original. Worth buying and reading if you are interested in CS as a subject of study and are not required to buy some other CS text for an Intro course."
1,Wach out,Im considering here the format of this book on kindle only. Mind that all the examples will be written with dot size math symbols that could be blown OVERSIZE SO ONES WONT BE ABLE TO READ MORE THAN A FEW ON THE SCREEN and even those are out of focus. Readeble if youve got good yes. pity.
4,For older end of age range,"I picked this up at our local library after we watched chicks hatch at a display at our local fair. This was a little too much information for my 4 1/2-year-old. We have read many Stage 1 books from this series; this is the first one I've seen at this level that addresses reproduction. In very simple terms it talks about ""mating"" and ""fertilization."" Be prepared to respond to questions about this topic.The other Stage 1 books I've read with my son seem to be shorter, with fewer words. He has begun to pick out some sight words and the simpler books work well for that. In my opinion, this one might have been better rated for the Stage 2 level in this series.I will certainly return to this book with him. It is well written with accurate information and has clear illustrations."
2,Can't believe I read the whole thing!,"I was going to stop reading this about halfway through, but I have trouble leaving things unfinished. I found all the characters irritating, quirky to a fault, and in desparate need of getting another story if this was the only one."
5,Great book group book,"Nobody writes about families as well as Monica Wood does, especially in My Only Story. This is a perfect book group book!"
4,My Only Story by Monica Wood,"Simply a good story well told. Unpredictable, insightful and honest.Monica is a writer who knows how to depict the quirky world we live in and the twists and turns that relationships take. I enjoyed this story."
5,A peek into seemingly ordinary lives.,"Ms. Wood opens the door and invites us to spectate the lives of two seemingly ordinary characters. A beautician and a salesman, who meet for the first time in a church basement. It takes a special talent to make the reader feel immediately comfortable with the characters and make us want to get to know them better. These characters could be anyone we know; anyone attending a neighborhood meeting in our own church basements; anyone running a family bakery in our own neighborhood; anyone next door with a beauty salon in their basement.Everyone has a story. It's the method of telling of that story which enhances it, keeps us interested. Monica Wood has achieved that perfectly with ""My Only Story."""
1,Don't bother,I hated this book. I kept thinking that it had to get better based on the reviews on Amazon. Her neediness was oppressive. Ugh!
5,This book is a treasure,"My Only Story is an enchanting book. Wood's mastery of the language creates beautiful, sometimes poetic prose. I fell in love with her characters, who were all engaging and winsome. Even the ""bad guys"" were compelling, fully realized, struggling with their own devils while hurting the protagonists. The ending was inevitable and believable, and I was sorry to say goodbye to the characters.Wood's ability to express both human pain and human hope is very refreshing. I look forward to reading every word she writes from now on. Also, I strongly recommend her other novel, Secret Language."
2,a good start; a tangled finish,"This Neil Simon comedy has fun with the hard-boiled Humphry Bogart character. Peter Falk does a respectable job, even avoiding characteristics which would lead viewers constantly to remember him as Columbo. Some of the other characters overplay the role, even as comic parodies.There is virtually no plot except a series of parodies of *Casablanca,* *The Maltese Falcon,* and other classics. At first, these parodies are fun, but after about the first 45 minutes, the fun fades. For the latter half of the movie, Neil Simon seems to have forgotten about any semblance of coherent plot and spent all his jokes."
2,Sporadically Funny Spoof,"Writer Neil Simon employs the same approach to humor here that he did in ""Murder by Death"" by peppering the film with non-stop jokes. The problem is that there are more duds per legitimate laughs here in this send-up of Bogart films. Peter Falk's prescence here redeems the proceedings;he'd be funny reading the phone book. That said, with the material he's given here he may as well have been. Many character actors appear here and are virtually wasted. You could whittle this film down to a fifteen minute sketch for, say, the old ""Carol Burnett Show"" and you may have a passable enterprise."
3,Underwhelming,"The movie starts off cute enough, but the Casablanca theme gets very tedious,beginning with an exasperating scene in the ""Moroccan"" restaurant. Neil Simonprobably penned this in a fortnight or less, a lot of stale jokes, really offfrom his good stuff. Falk is OK, but the whole gag of him accumulating womenis also a dud and fails to engage. The breadth of the ensemble cast is impressive, and probably worth watching just for all the familiar faces if you'remiddle-aged or above."
3,"So Put It Out In WIDESCREEN, Already!!!","Cheap Detective? Cheapo version is more like it - this flick has been sadly butchered into a small standard frame format, which marks the real ""murder"" here. So the studio (and/or the DVD maker) is the REAL ""killer"" this time.It features a HUGE cast, which is all the more reason that this comedic gem must be released in its full Panavision glory. Until that time, this 5 star film only gets 3 lousy stars, and the DVD makers get ZERO of my money.(Unlike the GREAT version of the similar modern comedy classic Murder By Death, which is on DVD in beautiful widescreen and which I strongly urge eveyone to buy.)I therefore advise all fans of Falk, Sellers and company to BOYCOTT this pan-and-scan travesty, until the proper widescreen version is finally put out!"
5,Superb satire,"An hilarious spoof of classic Bogart films. Falk fills the Bogie role, Fernando Lamas, Madeline Kahn and Eileen Brennan are excellent.If you appreciate Casablanca,The Maltese Falcon,and The Big Sleep,you will certainly enjoy not only the acting,but the stage settings as well. Outstanding"
3,Widescreen available on Amazon.ca,"For those like me looking for a widescreen version of this title (it was filmed in anamorphic 2.35:1), it's available on Amazon's Canadian website - for a decent price I might add."
4,Spoof of all Spoofs,"What a spoof. Even Phil Silvers is added for the mayhem and glib references made in this corker.I can see all those favorite lines..that all have been quoting..how about"" Peter Falk to Marsha Mason..."" Why dont you go into the kitchen and bake a couple dozen doughnuts""?If you are a film fan..get some adhesive tape for your sides you might need it from laughing.""Snell""!"
5,"""Why do they tell me these things?""","I loved Peter Falk in this movie. I picked up the DVD some time back and only just now had an opportunity to watch it. FUNNY! Of course, you really have to know Casablanca to appreciate just how funny it really is."
3,The Cheap Detective,"This movie was sort of a sequel (but not) to the '76 movie Murder By Death, also written by Neil Simon. I love Neil Simon plays and Murder By Death. I had completely forgotten about this movie, then saw it advertised and thought to order it. Has a great ensemble cast. Unfortunately, it in no way lives up to Simons normal standards and does not compare to Murder By Death! If you can get it for a couple of bucks as I did, then go for it. Interesting to watch, but it is actually a terrible movie. Poorly directed, very slow paced at times, and the humor just isn't there. There are a few places to chuckle every so often, but that's about it. The sets are fantastic to see and the weaving of story lines between The Maltese Falcon and Casablanca (two of my all time favs) is very interesting. But it is only interesting to see how it works together, check out the sets and costumes, and then, I'm afraid, it probably won't be watched again for a long time."
4,A Fun Flick for Falk Fans,"I have enjoyed Peter Falk's various roles for many years, and this is a good addition to his body of work. His portrayal of the bumbling detective is one of the best of the type, and here he takes shots at his own roles on that field."
3,Before he was Columbo,"Peter Falk played a character who was very like Columbo on many levels in this film. It's good but not great, and can't make up its mind between serious and comedy, but was still a good performance by Falk and worth watching."
5,6 great gothic novels in one very attractive book,"very attractive shelf book/in navy blue and gold/includes all six great gothic novels: Moonraker's Bride by Madeline Brent, The Golden Unicorn by Phyllis A. Whitney, Kirkland Revels by Victoria Holt, Wings of the Falcon, Barbara Michaels, Lady of Mallow by Dorothy Eden and River Rising by Jessica North. This is a wonderful collection of the best. Don't buy individual when you can get this wonderful collection at such a great price."
3,Nice Condensed Novel Set.,"This is a cute intro series of stories from serveral really good classic authors. These stories are a nice combination of mystery, suspence and romance, but without all the smut that tends to be in novels these days. The only downer, is that they are in condensed form, so you don't get quite the full details of the story."
5,Great Reading for a successful business!,"As a subscriber to the online Year To Success course, I can only offer the positive advice of my experience which is to suggest that all business owners and individuals read this book! It's good for the soul and spirit and it will serve as a guide for making the right decisions while focusing on what it takes to succeed."
2,Quality disappoints,I have had to replace the chopper attachment 4 times so far. The gears are plastic and break within months of use. I expected better from Cuisinart. I am replacing it with another brand this time.
1,Short lived joy,"I received this blender last November. Worked great for a month or so, then the gears stopped turning the attachments. Got a replacement. It worked great for a while... then it stopped working with the same problem. Seems like it's a complete dud."
2,Very poor quality filming and cloudy colors.......,We have not watched them. They arrived just an hour ago and we did watch 30 mins.of one but the filming quality seems very poor vs.those we have watched on PBS. That is all I can offer to say and wish to return the product for a refund and will invest in a newer version.
2,"Contents good, Video quality low","Contents were good as advertised, but video quality were real disappointment. I expected DVD level cinematic video quality, but in reality video quality is VHS level. This DVD series is very useful for a tourer who prepares for real travel, but not for a DVD viewer who hopes for DVD quality scenery experience. So be careful!"
5,Great hand lotion,Calming lavender scent in non-greasy lotion. Perfect as hand and body lotion for any age. I use it at night before going to sleep. Sweet dreams!
3,Great if your issue isn't the system itself,"For those of us who see the system as the problem being asked to cajole our elected candidates to our point of view seems useless to say the least, for instance how do you get a corrupt official consider reform, etc. Living in a state dominated by one party or the other tends to make these methods a bit moot, however if your issue(s) are simpler and offer the candidate less to lose, say getting funding for MS this book is immensely helpful."
4,Good basics for getting started.,This book was recommended for additional reading. It was short and easy to follow. There are worksheets to help with organization. These work sheets are also available online for reprinting.This is a great resource and saves time.
4,Decent pan.,"The pan came with a scratch on the outside of it. It was not worth the effort to send it back, since it is not sold directly from Amazon. Otherwise, it is a nice looking pan. I made crepes with it the other day. It is not as easy to cook with as the non-stick variety, but I didn't want the non-stick because of the associated health risks. The crepes did stick a bit in the beginning despite using a lot of butter. Unfortunately, this is how we have to cook if you are concerned about non-stick coatings."
1,Not Free SF Reader,"Horror that just not keep your interested over the years of the story. A bit of perversion here or there, and that is about it.The book is also used as a device to look at London society through a few decades. That part of it was not particularly interesting."
1,awfull,"I will put this to you straight. I could not understand this book. The author uses as little as possible detail, and expects you to fill in the spaces, but that does not work for me. It was like reading a different language."
3,family history,"I should have read description better but was dismayed book was written in, otherwise is quality book and very prompt service."
4,Almost Like Holding the Guns in Your Own Hands,"I thought this is a wonderful book. There are terrific close-up photos of the guns from different angles which are the next best thing to actually holding them. In addition there are exploded diagrams, historical background, and stories about individuals who are particulary associated with each gun. I only wish the book was longer, more in depth, and had more examples of these classics . (The S&W K-22 .22 caliber revolver is one of my favorites that wasn't in the book, for example.) - - I hope the author comes out with additional editions covering other firearms presented in this same style and format. I would definitely buy them. - - - (Note: I'm a very picky buyer - 4 stars is an extremely high rating for me.)"
2,a very few goods guns,"Don't get your hopes up with this slim tome. It only covers 20 models of handguns and six of those are pretty much the same guns in different calibers, Colt and Smith and Wesson double action revolvers."
1,Waste of Money,Do not waste your money on this textbook! Even the most basic concepts are poorly explained. Examples are random and rarely help to reinforce the lesson. You can find a much better physics book for a fraction of the price. I can't believe they published this book!!
1,This book is worthless,"I used this book for my physics class and I totally hate it. We will be using it again for next semester and I wish they would use a different one. If you are a teacher, please save your studernts from the headache! pick a better book!"
3,Doesn't explain the concepts well enough and it's overpriced like all textbooks,"I didn't think this book was all that great at explaining the concepts but I don't really have anything to compare it to. And like all textbooks, it's rediculously overpriced. I can't believe people are getting away with charging these exorbitant prices to poor starving students who have enough trouble as it is paying for college and everything else."
3,Starts out slow but picks up.,"Many years ago my daughter read A Separate Peace, by this same author at school, and wanted to read more by him, so I got this book for her. I don't what she thought of it, or if she ever even actually read it. Now that I've read it myself I realize it's not a Young Adult book, and she was only 13 at the time I received it for her. I think I had just assumed this author's books were written for teens.Anyway, that aside, I just finished reading this myself today. In the beginning it was ok. Brendan Lucas has rented a villa while on vacation, and is to be joined there by his sister, her fiance who is also his best friend, his mother, and the fiance's sister. Neville, the cook who came with the house, is a very odd duck.The book read smoothly but the story pretty much slid right out of my mind when I put the book down. Neville's behaviour becomes more and more erratic, and the last third of the book did turn out to be pretty gripping."
2,spider man xmen x stands for do not get,this game is bad and the game play when you crawl up walls reach the top no problem pull yourself up but you cannot when you wanna climb down a wall you do not face down you face up! and spider man can swing off a far away building his web he shoots out gos not even a quarter cross the screen let go and your web you fire dos not web enemy up this game is bad no saves? even password saves would be nice never get this game at least you can play as storm wolverine cycolps and gamble save you cash and do not get this game!
2,Couldn't finish it,"I love historical romance, but only quality writing with believable characters. I'm not knocking the historic aspect, because the settings and overall writing were generally okay, but the love scenes were full of purple prose and the men were so over-the-top knowledgeable about how to please a woman that I was rolling my eyes. Repeated usage of words like phallus and mons were bad enough, but the phrase '[her bud] unfurled it's petals and bloomed like a passionflower' is about the time I put the book down for good."
4,Enjoyable,"Insatiable will keep you up reading way past when you thought you would stop. The hero was strong and smart. The heroine a bit less so. Having the heroine declare over and over again how Impetuous she was got a bit tired. She had moments with children and her family like maid Maggie where she showed heart and real emotion. The mother and daughter relationship wa a treat, I would have liked to see it a bit more and see a bit of her mothers thoughts on the subject.All in all another great read by Virginia Henley"
3,CURE FOR INSOMNIA---,"This book was so bogged down that the only way I got through it was by heavy skimming. I found if I mostly read the italicized sentences (there were many) I could keep up with the story and make it to the end. It didn't help that I found the characters basically unlikable and constantly changing, the amount of time spent on describing clothing mind-numbing, and the ending terribly rushed. I did like that the hero could visit the heroine in dreams, but that aspect was discarded early on. I also enjoyed bits and pieces of the historical information, a lot more so than the people, which is sad when you think about it as this was supposed to be a romance."
3,T'was Alright,"When I want a good historical romance, Virginia Henley is who I usually turn to for that fix. This was not one of her best works, but it was enjoyable all the same. The characters were certainly well shaped and the plotline interesting. I especially liked the twist of Lord ""Bloody"" Stewart's ""gift"" of second sight as it added an extra bit of intrigue to the novel.I only had one problem with the willing suspension of disbelief that most readers have to face in order to become encompassed by a work of fiction. To me, it was utterly unbelievable that our heroine made it through catching the plague and all the gruesome lovliness that came with it, and still remain pregnant!All in all, I would recommend this title to Romance readers and Henley fans alike. However, I will always be partial to Ms. Henley's earlier works, namely (as I like to call them) the ""And the...and the"" series: The Pirate and the Pagan, The Falcon and the Flower, The Raven and the Rose etc."
1,the jewish resistance,This book was a good book. Unfortunately it had a lot of problems. First of all their were too many names. Second it talks about areas that no longer exist. Third of all the names of some of these places are impossible to pronounce. You would need to know a lot about World War 2 to understand this book. If you do not like reading about the holocaust then you should not read this book. This book is very old and does not have much relevance to the present day. The book also contains first hand accounts of some of the survivors. All in all I would give this book a 1.
3,Solar Cascade Fountain,We like the fountain. It is very attractive. There is one problem. The solar panel does not store energy like a solar light. If a cloud drifts under the sun it stops immediatly. It only works if and when the sun is shining brightly on the panel.
3,Bubble Up,"I love the foundtain, the solar panels don't work that well so you have to plug it in most of the time and can't find replacement bowls, one broke"
5,make magic happen,"on reading many ""spiritual"" books over the past 35yrs,this has got most of the answers,it completes the cycle,I felt I was reading what I had patterned together over the many years,but it is the only book to give me the final answers i have been in search of,and now need to only search with-in.Yes,hard to take in all that it is,but it is IT.Thank-you Peter for having the understanding of relating this insight ,with such clarity and simplicity,of examples,I hope many others every-where read this incredible book -judy"
4,"Keen insights, clearly communicated....","In my years of exploration into myself, my spirituality and my relation to the world around, I have not found another source of information that so clearly explains how my innate ""Godness"" became distorted into the world of pain and frustration. Where is the joy and love promised me? Peter Erbe has done a fantasitic job of explaining how my Godness has been inverted into an upside down view of the world. I highly recommend this book to anyone seeking to reclaim their Godhood."
2,I sent it back,"The book has some pretty pictures and a very basic overview of the park in winter, but is geared very much toward SUV-travelers with plenty of cash and credit cards. Most of the information in this book can be learned from the free pamphlets you get at the park (or they'll send them to you). If you're looking for a more in-depth and personal experience, this book won't help you much."
4,"lovely , practical but a little but out of date","I was enthused about going in early 2010 based on the book. Much information predates snowmobiles regulation , and several, but not all phone #'s and websites out of dateall the ""big stuff"" was correct or easily correctable ."
5,Great for sisters,.... The stories of sibling rivalry with occasional cooperation sound very familiar to our girls! The final story about Thunder Cookies will have your kids anxiously awaiting the next storm for a chance to try out the special recipe.
5,Cello Adagios,I already owned this CD - Cello Adagios. A friend heard it at my home and said how much she loved it so I bought it for her as a birthday present. There are 2 separate CDs. The music is exquisite!
5,Transducer works well on pontoon,This transducer works well on the rear of a pontoon that has a bracket welded on from the factory. \It stays out of harms way as my bracket is up on the toon about an inch.
3,"Gussie up, hoes down","What happens when Mrs. Butterworth's and Liz Claiborne's children meet up? Why, romance, of course! And I've got the book to prove it.This one didn't work for me, although I wouldn't call it a bad book. The seams just showed a few times too often, and the story had a tendency to get romantic to the point where it reminded me of its fictional nature. It's hard to keep suspending disbelief when things are a little too perfect; the world behaving in ways it would generally not behave in real life.But it is sweet, in its way. Borderline overcute. Still might put a smile on your face."
5,Great book,"I thought this was a wonderful book, I have read 3 of Coffman's books, and this is by far the best. It was one of those feel good books!!!"
4,And so it begins...,"The kids have gotten their fighting done and it's time for the grown ups to do their thing. Great time to meet new DBZ characters including Kibit, Supopo Bitchi(Name may be changed in English) and Kaioshin(most likely changed). Plus with Supopo and Yam in the tournament out for Gohan's energy the evil force of the Majin finally comes into play. It won't be long before Majin Boo arrives."
3,Videl Fights,"This DVD is mainly Videl fighting Spopovich. Then towards the end it's Gohan's turn to fight Kibito. Spopovich and Yamu steal Gohan's energy and fly away. The Z fighters, the Supreme Kai and Kibito fly after them them. Supreme Kai and Kibito explain to the Z fighters who Babidi is and about resurrecting Majin Buu. The menu is animated and there are lots of options."
4,At last!,The mere fact that this DVD was released in the US makes it a must-have for any Gene fan. A great performance from an even greater and often unrecognized band. The only shortcoming of this release is the overall quality of the video compression and audio mix. I would give it a 6.5 in a scale of 10. A shame really but expected from a show filmed back in 2000.The DVD also features 5 songs not on the CD and a very candid interview with the band members.Recommended!
5,Very nice glasses.,They look great and feel good in your hand. A person would assume that they are higher priced crystal. This is our second set of them.
2,Old Fashioned glass,Very disappointed as they were not as pictured. I expected to get the square solid bottom and this was not the case at all.
3,Not a how-to guide to Concept Therapy,This is a book about how the Concept Therapy philosophy can benefit lives. There is an overview list of the basic principles but you will not learn how to implement them. Evidently there are other books written by Thurman Fleet that explain how to implement these principles. This book consists primarily of stories of people who improved their lives by using Concept Therapy principles. I saw very little in the book about psychic self-improvement the way that most people would think of psychic.
3,Works great! (At first),"I've had this product for about a month now, and for the first month or so, it works just like all the other reviews said. Unfortunately, it has become slightly warped and I have lost several sinks full of water. Now I have to be extremely careful that it is in place just so. I was hoping this product would be reliable for longer than a few weeks."
3,Small but adequate,"It has been difficult to find a bag with a shoulder strap long enough that I can wear it across my body, which is necessary since I walk with a cane. This is the best one I was able to find, but it is rather smaller than I would like. It has room for wallet, checkbook, date book, etc., but not enough room for makeup and a hairbrush."
5,nice leather purse,wife loved it was made of fine quality leather and for the price you couldnt beat it
3,Didn't realize these were just straight pins,"I couldn't tell from the pic and it didn't mention anywhere in the description, but these are just large straight pins - not the typical bobby pins with the ridges (or whatever you call the wavy part of the pin?). They are also much larger than a standard bobby pin. Maybe i will find a use for these, but next time i will buy something different."
4,"Good story, entertaining","This was a good read. Entertaining and sweet. The plot moved along nicely. Ms. Summerville had a continuity problem, though. During the first 90 pages, our hero, Jack, could not decide what color to keep his eyes. First we met up with a brown eyed gentlemen on page 33. On page 76, his brown eyes turned blue. But, finally on page 89 and beyond, he settled into grey eyes. It did make for interesing, as in comical, reading. However, desipte the author's lack of decision, this was an very entertaining Regency ."
3,lots of action,"as in the other books of the series there is a lot of action but as a carrier sailor who has been there on that class of ship, there is a lot of errors in the books. one of the biggest is radarman in cvic the saliors who man it are called operations specialist.there are few other items that if he did some research he would find them. but other wise its a good series."
4,Love live the Dead Man,"The Undertaker is my alltime favorite wrestler.In the begining of this dvd,he talks about his days as Mean Mark Callous in WCW,and his early years in WWE when he was this mythic character.It shows the highlights and interviews from Kurt Angle,Egde,DDP,Jericho,and evan Kane.It evan brings you up to his return at Judgement Day and his fueds with Triple H,and Kurt Angle.Undertaker the Phenom I thought was just as good because in that dvd,there is no interviews,but memorable fueds,as this one is more revealing and it evan shows a segment at home with his wife.I guess the Undertaker is human afterall."
5,Undertaker61986's Review For Undertaker:This is my yard,"First, let me say that I have been an Undertaker fan for his complete decade of destruction. This video is alot better then Undertaker The Phenom. It shows his personal opinions of his matches plus it shows his collection of Harley's. A must have for any Undertaker fan!"
5,great,"I love wrestling, I love the Undertaker even more so pretty anything he comes out with I buy. This was great."
3,Dont be fooled,"Yes this DVD is rare, but pick up the Tombstone 3 disk set instead. Yeah, you get about 5 minutes of WCW footage, but besides that its nothing special."
5,Undertakers Yard.,Listen who gives a crap whats on the new Undertaker dvd release.This spot is to talk mainly about whats on the Undertaker this is my Yard dvd.If you want to review that dvd go to where it is listed on Amazon.com because thats a space for that review.Now would someone with good sense please list what matches are on this dvd and their review of this dvd.Thank You!
1,"old ""skool"" kung fu","I have 3 words for this flick "" WASTE OF TIME"",, very dissapointing,,,they set the expectation but did not deliver!! One of Gordon Liu's poorest performance."
3,i thought it was a good movie,overall the movie was kind of slow paced but i thought it was a good movie!
5,The most incredible book on parenting I've ever read!!!!!!,A great book for Christian Parents who's #1 goal in parenting is raising kids who put God first. Full of examples and help in discipline etc... You have to get it!!!!
1,Not what I expected!,Not at all what I expected. Very disappointed with this purchase.Tamiya 1/350 U.S. Navy Aircraft #21/350 US Navy Aircraft Set
1,silly,"Don't bother with this book if you want to learn how to improve your health because it will irritate you so much in trying to read through it that you'll blow a gasket.Tedious and silly. I can picture this writer giggling the entire time he wrote this complete silliness, thinking it was cute and clever. What, am I four years old?If I wanted a bedtime story I'd read Anderson or Grimm's.I am bewildered that this book ever made it past the editors desk and was published. It's insulting to the intelligence."
5,Golf for Women,The DVD set is extremely helpful and a fun learning experience for women golfers at all levels. I also purchased the book that goes with the 4-set DVD series. I purchased the DVD set from the Amazon Marketplace and it was received promptly.
4,High Quality Case,The case is an attractive unit. High quality leather is used. I've had a comment asking if the case came with the Palm TX I bought hoping it was included with the base TX. Offers good protection with ease of use. It has a magnetic strap. A lot better than the physical snap button. Would I buy one knowing what I know now? Yes.
5,DOES IT'S JOB!,"Purchased it for my Palm TX and it does the job! It's a case, it protects, and it works well for me. I don't use the lil swivel clip, not really liking that and plus I don't clip it onto myself."
2,Belt Clip stinks,The case is nice but it falls off the belt clip very easy causing it to hit the ground. The Belt clip stinks. I cannot carry mine now except in my hand.
4,Very Elegant,"After ownership of several PDA units over the years (and having all kinds of cases for them), I finally found the best case I ever had. This is very elegant and very formal, and the quality of the material is top-notch. This is truly value for money (and the item is inexpensive too) and coupled with a very fast shipping from Amazon, I really consider this purchase a steal!"
4,Very nice PDA,"I've been a fan of PALM PDAs for over 12 years. They all have had their quirks, and this one is no exception. Overall, I find it a very good value. The large color screen looks great indoors, but is easily washed out when outside on a bright day. The performance is good, but not excellent. The built-in memory gives lots of space to add plenty of applications. The SD card expansion allows you to carry lots of extra data, including MP3 music files. I use a 4Gb SD card for this and it works great. The WiFi performance has been good, but not as good as a laptop's WiFi. I haven't used the Bluetooth yet. The ""Blazer"" web browser is fair. It is slow to start up, and often hangs, requiring a soft re-boot of the device. It won't display very large web pages that include lots of photos very well."
2,Rhino Skin for Palm T5,"Very snug fit, slightly cumbersone case. The worst part is the cheap plastic clip that broke a month after purchase."
4,An Open and Shut Case!,"I purchased the RhinoSkin Leather Flipcase for my Palm TX. I did some comparison shopping and found this to be one of the better cases around. It has most of the features I was looking for, such as protection for any open ports on the TX, a good fit and non-obstruction of the screen. Because I tend to put the case in my bag, I found the clip in the way, and if you don't attach the clip, the case looks like it's missing something, that's the only thing I, personally, didn't care for. Overall it's a great case!"
4,good value for the price,"I wanted an inexpensive case for my palm T/X. This one is great. It provides good protection for my pda. I refused to pay $35-40 for a case! Nothing fancy here--palm t/x fits loosely; but doesn't side out. Also, the cover is not on the side--so you can still hold the palm without the case getting in the way."
2,Give me a break! A screw head for a swivel belt clip?!?,"I've seen some cheap, tacky and poorly designed similar items but this one gets the all time ""Most sorriest excuse for a swivel belt clip design"". Seriously, that's all it is, a metal screw head that sticks out the back of the case about 1/4"" and used to slide in and out of a flimsy plastic belt clip. The friction of the case swinging back and forth against the screw could actually loosen the screw (which doesn't have much of a bite into the threads to begin with) and next thing you know you're crossing the street and yout PDA falls off without you even noticing. Something that's very easy to lose and easy to scratch any smooth surface if you were to set it down on say a nice wood finished desk. A regular, padded, stationary clip as is typical on eyeglass cases and older cell phone cases would have been more preferable and practical.On the positive side, the rest of the case is well made and fits my Palm TX nicely."
1,Because of this case I lost my PDA,"Like the other reviewer said this case is held by a small flat head screw from the plastic belt clip, if it rocks back and forth a lot it will fall off which it unfortunately did easily and now my 300 dollar Palm TX/T5 is gone and probably I will never see it again. Which is highly unfortunate and I will need to buy a new PDA since I need one. On the bright side the case itself is made from high quality leather and looks attractive but what's the point if the case can fall off easily from your belt clip."
1,Plastic clip-on broke after one week,"The case has a plastic clip-on for your belt. Mine broke after only one week, and I could not find a replacement for it. It seems like I would have to buy the whole case again. It is really a bad design. Not clear why they did not make the clip-on out of metal."
3,Classic Justin TimberLake ____------- - - - Great,"This is Justins's new CD single ---it's not a bad for his solo CD singleThe Like I love you is great, and probably one of the best cuts off his debut. It's catchy and slick. You've all heard it before.Hope there's the remixHis awesome talented voice makes you stand up o your feet.loud---emotional----moving---energeticThis is what this CD is ---AwesomeHHHHmmmmmwell maybe not he best bUt its greatHe goes a little tooo high and sounds like a ----GIrlSorry Justin ---and His dance moves are like of Micheal Jacksonand his trying to go all R&B and Rap wich is not his usual pop."
5,"A thoughtful, helpful book.","Steven Mosley has identified the 10 Commandments of the New Testament bybuilding on the 10 most common action verbs used by Jesus and the apostles. Inthis brief, simply written book, his terse-but-powerful sentences caused me topause and reflect. Any book that will do that for me rates a high recommendation."
2,Too sentimental and religious,"I found the book to be too religious for my tastes. I don't think ""God"" is telling me to accept the fact that most of my objects of value are going to be destroyed by these rambunctious (oh, aren't they just wonderfully spirited) boys of mine. Yes, a lot of what is in the book is what I fully expect is going to happen because I gave birth to creatures with XY chromosomes. However, unlike in the book, I don't feel I have to accept and be all sentimental about their high activity levels, inability to sit still, short attention spans, fascination with guns, rough play, and all the other things that seem to go along with the presence of testosterone. There are more choices in role models for today's boys than I read about in this book. And I shall continue to disapprove of the stereotypical and negative male behaviors I see them display, not embrace those behaviors as evidence that I have ""spirited young boys."""
2,Boring,"I found this movie a waste of time. It really was a long 90 minutes. I suppose if I had liked or even known the actors I might have found some enjoyment in it, but I only knew the one and she is not one of my favorites. The music was very nice, with old hymns used in the score and played on period instruments. This movie really put me to sleep. I found the script dull and lifeless. I do love period pieces, but this one was sorely lacking compared to the BBC productions. I would recommend that you borrow this from your library before buying it (try an inter-library loan if your library doesn't have it). I would hate to see someone spend over $20 on this and find that it was a waste of time to watch it."
4,The Europeans,Lee Remick was superb in this movie. The photography was also spectacular indicating change of season andinside characterizations. The old world and the New World with customs and manners was well represented.It was fun to see this movie.
4,The life in 19th century massachussets,"Excellent descrition of the life in high class,very conservative and religious America late in the 19th century. As most of Ivory pictures it has beatiful settings and great views of nature and lifestyle of the upper very conservative class in North east coast America,however still naive to the european royalty or impostors."
1,Obviously the creators of the game did not play it...,"The only fun we had was making fun of how terrible the game was. The rules were confusing, and did not explain a lot of scenarios that we encountered during play. We had to make up some rules to get by. There is no way to win the game as the terrorist. Completely unbalanced and too long -- there is no way to actually play all 24 rounds. You have to shuffle SO MUCH. Annoying. There were typos in the game instructions and box. This cannot be played with 2 players. Not worth it. I cannot believe that anyone actually played this game to test out the kinks. There are plenty of kinks to be worked out. 24 is an amazing show, but just not this game!"
5,Great Pan!,"This is a great pan for the price. It is made out of heavy cast Iron and comes already seasoned and ready to use. The picture is a little deceptive, the pan is more oval than it looks, but that's ok because it looks better than the one in the picture."
2,Not the best MST,"This is not the best MST by far. It was far to sleazy for me. If you want a good MST go for ""Pod People"" or ""I Accuse My Parents."" those I think are the best, not this one"
3,I don't know about this one.,"The actual game is , um, ok I guess. It has pretty solid rules. But the main thing that bothers me about this game is that IT IS A CHEAP VERSION OF SHADOWRUN. SHADOWCHASERS ANYONE? The firearms don't seem to do much more damage than a sword or an Ax in dnd. If you want a modern fantasy/cyberpunk setting, play shadowrun"
2,Lame adaption of a great concept,I waited for weeks with anticipation for d20 modern and I have to say I was pretty disappointed. I definitely think WotC had a chance to really make something great out of this and failed. Too bad. Very generic book. Example: classes. The strong hero? The fast hero? Can't we do better than this. Really pretty pathetic.
1,"Move along, nothing to see here!","I just don't understand the continued fascination with abstract concepts such as levels and hit dice. If you really want to play a balanced system that can provide you interesting, challenging, and detailed combat, choose another system. If you want interesting characters that aren't bound by d20's restrictions upon feats and skills, go elsewhere. This fails to provide any guidance for good role-playing and is simply an extension of the boring ""hack at it"" system that is 3.5 D&D."
1,Don't bother,"As I scanned this book, I could only shake my head. WizardsOTC had the golden opportunity to produce the canonical product to encompass 19th, 20th, and 21st century role-playing. Instead, they gave us orcs with firearms. There are plenty of source-books and games out there that simulate these eras better than d20 Modern - for instance, Call of Cthulhu, Spycraft, even d20 Traveller.It's clear that the designers and developers are out of touch with their audience."
1,WotC: Cheating people for over 10 years!!!,"Gimme a minute, I'm still laughing about the fact that if you add the back of Dungeon 91-94 and the basic 3rd Edition handbooks you come up with about the same as this book...Done. Whew. That was the best laugh I've had since watching the news the other day. Seriously, this book is an ultra waste of money. Wizards of the Coast (WotC) really crossed the line with this book, because it was a travesty just as much as the 3rd edition Monster Manual (I'll save that review for later). I didn't buy this book, I read it at a local bookstore (took me all of 20 mins to skim). I really can't think of anything else anyone forgot to mention, so I'll quit now"
4,"Strong, but heavy","I'm using the shelf to mount (2) half-width mic preamps in a standard 2-high portable electronics enclosure. The Middle Atlantic unit is well made and well finished. It's fine for a fixed (non-mobile) situation. It's strong enough not to warp when used to support almost any possible equipment. However, it is heavy steel, and is overkill for my (2) 2lb preamps. For portable use, an aluminium version would be much preferable.Even with the elaborate slot pattern punched through the shelf, none of the holes lined up with the mounting bolts on the (2) small chassis I was mounting. It was no problem drilling a few holes with a drill press to allow the chassis to be positioned properly. Middle Atlantic does supply some adhesive backed hook and loop strips to use, but if the item you're mounting is a full rack space height, the hook and loop fastener takes up too much space to be used."
3,"Only for a couple small, light-weight items","This thing seems ok at first blush, but it is quite small and not all that rugged when you know what other 1U shelves are out there. This was confirmed when I ordered a deeper 1U shelf from Gator Cases:http://www.amazon.com/Gator-Cases-Utility-Elongated-15-Inch/dp/B001ECQQ9C/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid;=1302551342&sr;=8-2This is a seriously stout piece that is much larger and makes the UTR1 look flimsy in comparison. Throw in the fact that the Gator Cases unit is only $10 more and the UTR1 looks overpriced as well.So, If you need ""small and light"" over ""durable and spacious"", then the UTR1 may be fine. However, I would plan on buying Velcro to secure anything you place on the shelf. Otherwise, it will not take much tilting to have your expensive gear sliding onto the floor because there is no lip on this shelf either."
2,This is a lightweight,"This product is very lightweight. It could not hold my 42"" 5-1 reflector panels. The arm and parts are so lightweight that I don't forsee these product lasting too long with moderate to heavy use. Spend a few dollars more and get the Manfrotto arm. Much better built. Arm, clamps, etc are heavy duty. It works fine with my reflectors and looks like it can handle a great deal of use."
5,Mom's hard to find powder,Mom cannot find this powder in any of the department stores she used to find it in. Thank goodness for Amazon. Mom has used this powder for YEARS.
5,Great Fragraance!,my mother loves this fragrance and her birthday is just around the corner. This is a light and fresh scent.
1,NOT Evyan,This is not White Shoulders and the name EVYAN is not on the box or container anywhere...not even the small print. This is by a imitation manufacturer and a deception!
5,White Shoulders talc,"very nice and just as I remember it from 40 years ago, very pleasant and brings back some wonderful memories."
5,Ginger wonder spice,I found this book to be well researched and most helpful in my own personal health. So pleased such excellent information is available to the public!
4,"Great story, adaptation could be better","One of the high points in Doctor Who's broadcast history came about in 1977. This serial was quickly adapted into this novel.The TARDIS materialises in Victorian London, with the Doctor decides to show Leela how her ancestors lived. Instead, they get caught up in a Fu Manchu-like story filled with a Tong, a mysterious murderer, trips through the sewers, normal animals grown to unusual sizes, and enough revcognisable elements recast in surprising ways.The story is aided and abetted by wonderful supporting characters, not the least being theatre-owner henry Gordon Jago and police pathologist Professor Litefoot. There are also literary references to Sherlock Holmes, Oscar Wilde, and so on.The story is wonderful, and this book, while it could be better, is still more than acceptable."
2,Did not work for ps2,"I bought this memory card so I could play a ps1 game on my thin ps2, but the description nicely left out the fact that the two are incompatible. Thus I spent the money, and my time waiting, for nothing."
4,Too difficult for elementary ages,"Not sure what I was thinking when I ordered this for my 6th grade grandson. I like the concept of the book, but most problems are better suited for college aged math majors."
3,An alright album but just for fans,"I'm a big fan of all 6 Tea Party albums and would recommend all of them to anyone who likes rock. That said I would only recommend this album to big fans of the Tea Party. The albums not bad, just not good. The opening track, The World Is Calling You, has power and gets it started off right, but then the next 7 tracks just roll along listlessly without enough punch, emotion, or inspired playing to really stand out from one another. A few of these tracks, if surrounded by stronger tracks would have been fine and good for the album. I'm not saying they are bad tracks, I'm just saying they are only descent tracks and there's too many of them in a row. The album does have an upswing at the end with the last too tracks. The Kingdom has strong emotion and is beatifully laid out, while Good Time Song is just that, simple and fun. So again, it's an OK album with a few great tracks."
2,He left the Tea Party for this?????,"Jeff Martin is very talented, but this isn't what i'd call his best work. The first track on this cd sounds far too much like The Tea Party and it's somewhat pretentious as it's supposed to be an ""open"" letter to president Bush. We'll have to wait for his 2nd solo effort for that open letter to Kim Jong-il and the other dictators of the world. The rest of the tracks are mainly blues based music that sound like jimmy page leftovers from his zeppelin days. If you really want to hear Jeff Martin at his best, check out his work with The Tea Party which is probably the best band you've never heard."
4,A must for Bergman fans,"I have more than 20 of Bergman's films and purchased this trilogy because I wanted a better quality copy of ""Through a Glass Darkly."" Criterion has done a very good job with this DVD considering the age of the film from which it was copied."
4,Indispensable,"Each of these films stand on their own, but they are really remarkable when viewed as a trilogy. Although the mini-documentaries on each film are nice, I always like it when Criterion does commentary tracks, so I miss that here. These films offer an essential bridge between the world of Seventh Seal with the world of Fanny And Alexander. Essential to understanding this seminal director."
4,"Love, love, love this book","I'm wondering if Ms. Ciotta copied Lulu from who tend to be from time to time. You don't see that many cute, goofy fun heroines in books anymore. I find them to be overly competent, overly analytic and tough. Don't get me wrong, in the end, Luciana held her own and was no pushover. But how can you not love a character that dresses like a princess (Charming) or a mermaid for little kids parties. Princess Charming could even charm the ever doubtful 4-9 year old boys while dressed as a princess. Mobsters and neighborhood curmudgeons had crushes on her sweetness and innocence.Who doesn't love a former marine that did humanitarian missions, a p.i. who put it all on the line to keep the sweet and innocent safe! The whole cast of characters are likable, enjoyable and I look forward to seeing more from them in the rest of her series."
4,paper yes postage no,I loved the product but was very disappointed in the cost of shipping. I'll probably look for another way to purchase the same thing as the shipping was as much as the paper.
5,don't let the shipping charge put you off,"Don't let the high shipping charge stop you from buying these. If you do the math using the entire price including shipping, and compare price by how much paper you're getting, its still many times cheaper to buy these sheets than box after box of parchment paper at the store. The paper seems identical and the pre-cut sheets are so much more convenient to use. They lay flat and I don't have to deal with the ragged edges I got when I tried to tear some off in a hurry from the serrated edge of a box."
3,good value even with expensive shipping,"Reynolds Parchment Paper costs about 3.00 in the store and and its 30sq ft(24'or 288"" X 15"") keep in mind the last 2 feet are not usable because its so tightly rolled it wont smooth out well and any waste from mis-cuts reduces usable amount even more. With that said each roll equals about 13 sheets(288""/21"") so you would need to purchase 8 rolls in the store costing 24 dollars to equal this order.With shipping this costs about 28, is the increase worth it?.. I'm not sure,but its close. I don't shop at costco or sam's so i dont know if they have a better price but i am guessing they do. I dont mind rolls vs the precut sheets but i do admit the precut is easier to useIf this product was 20 bucks instead of 17 and eligible for Amazon Prime, i would have already pulled the trigger but im gonna pass and see if sam's or Costco has better value."
5,Very handy around the kitchen,"What can you say about paper. . . . It works, good quality, makes baking so much easier. Sized a little larger than my pans, but I can deal with it."
2,What a crazy ad,Wht a crazy ad. It doesn't clearly say what size and how many cut sheets are in the offer. How do they expect anyone to buy a pig in the poke?
5,Wow! 2 Thumbs UP!,"Great Reference! Extremely helpful for locating colleges of your interest. Highly recommended book for those in grades 9-12. It not only helps you locate a college, but a field you would like to pursue."
5,Quick and easy way to find the facts,"It helped me place myself in the right direction as far as choosing a college. It's hard to choose colleges just by what you hear by older people but this book is extremely useful in information you need to know before visitng a college. I would reccomand this book. The software was useful to me, however if you know how to write a formal essay it's no big deal."
2,CD-ROM is Pathetic,"The CD-ROM that comes with the book is almost completely worthless. Some idiot decided it would be cute to use Flash for the interface. The result is something pretty but impossible to use.When you search colleges, they are listed five per page (yes, five). If you try to print them, you only get five colleges. For sixty colleges, that's twelve pages, whereas everything could have been on one page.They give you no ability to sort the data and getting the data into a form that you could use in a spreadsheet seems a formidable task.They also fail to include any quality ranking in the search criteria other than the very broad and inconclusive competitiveness rating.They have gone out of their way to cripple the product."
1,"Awful, Very Misleading","I was unfortunate enough to buy this product without sufficient information about it. The pictures are VERY misleading, as the planes come in a dull gray color and would take the most skilled craftsman to paint to the extent in the picture. Are those even the same planes???I was anticipating nice two inch long metal planes or plastic pre-assembled. You must snap off the pieced and put each plane together. I tried many different types of glues and cements, but nothing works on holes the size of a needle.And the scale on these things is more like 1/500... Some are barely an inch long.Overall and awful product that found my trash can within ten minutes. I was planning on purchasing the aircraft carrier if I liked these, but I don't expect much better quality that snap off pieces that don't stay glued for that either.I wonder if you have to snap the limbs on the model soldiers and try to paint them, too."
3,I love zatoichi,"This is not the typical Zatoichi movie. It has its good points, Zen moments, new situations for the blind hero, and the only two-sword performance in the series. The effort into this movie to stand out from the others feels a little unwelcome and a half-hearted effort in humor and plot, but a few scenes make it worth it. The idea in this one is that when Ichi tries to shrug off his typical sense of duty as a hero he is somehow led right back to it and we are offered this Zen detachment theme. As always there are a few memorable sword fights and demonstrations of skill. I would suggest its predecessors first."
5,One of the funniest!,"Easily one of the funniest movies in the series! The imposter Ichi has some great physical comedy. All in all a really fun campy sword film. Definitely not one to be missed.A great film and if you are lucky enough to own a copy count your blessings. It took the grace of God for me to find a copy out there for less than $100! I cannot understand why out of a 26 film series with all other titles available numbers 9 and 11 are the only ones unavailable.These are great movies. The Zatoichi series is a classic and they should be avaialble for the public without having to pay ridiculous marked up prices.Please someone, somewhere listen to the fans!"
5,Very Helpful,"I am not the type to sit down and spend a couple weeks reading a book before I start a diet (waste of time). This DVD helped me really understand how and why the diet works (I was a little skeptical). Dr. Atkins goes into some detail in the video on the specifics, the rest is in the personal diet manual included.The other thing I really like is the pocket sized Carb Counter that is inside. I can never remember what I can and can't eat. It's very helpful when I go out to eat and has over 1000 foods in it."
1,Kasey strikes out!,"This is the first truly bad book that I have ever read that was written by Kasey Michaels. I own more than 20 of her books which I enjoy and have reread. However, if this was the first KM book that I ever read, I would never have bought another of her books and I would have missed some excellent books.This book is vulgar and filled with perverted sex about a psycho! I kept hoping to find some redeeming theme but never found it. If it were possible to give it a half-star, I would have. Ugh! Horrible to not begin to describe it!"
4,If your new to Shiba's you need this book,"My husband and I adopted a shiba during an overseas military tour. Upon arriving in Alaska our vet had very few answers about our year and a half old shiba inu. We were scared out of our wits the first time she ""threw off her coat"". Our vet had no idea what was going on, we were worried sick. If you don't have access to alot of info on Shiba's this book is clear, concise, and very helpful in determining what has been going, is going, and will be going on with your Shiba. If you own a Shiba then buy the book. It will be immensley helpful in understanding your shibas quirks and keeping your Shiba disciplined, clean, and healthy. The more you know about your Shiba the more likley you are to outsmart him/her. The book was a great asset in outsmarting our little monster, if you have one or many, you will find something that will help you out in the book. Words of wisdom from one Shiba owner to the rest of us."
5,Rolf's Coin Purse,"I have used different versions of this same product for many years. It is the perfect size for a little money, a few credit cards, lipstick, etc., yet it is small enough to fit in my pocket. The only reason I have had to replace it is that the zippers are nylon--I tend to overfill the pouches and tug on the zipper too hard and break them. I have also ripped the lining in one of them. I have been unable to find them in my local stores, so I was delighted to find an on-line source."
5,Great wallet!,This wallet was just the size I wanted. Fine craftsmanship and lovely leather. Can't beat the price. I expect this wallet will last a long time.
2,just don't like it,Wish I would not have bought this. Looks cheap - very unfashionable. Don't like feel or anything about it. Yuk.
5,GREAT LITTLE COIN PURSE,"I JUST RECEIVED THIS COIN PURSE TODAY AND IT IS JUST WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR. I HAVE IT IN KIWI GREEN AND ITS VERY PRETTY. UNLIKE THE OTHER REVIEWER, I DON'T THIN K THAT IT IS CHEAPLY MADE. IT'S JUST RIGHT TO CARRY A COUPLE OF DREDIT CARDS AND DRIVERS LICENSE IN THE SEPARATE ID CASE. IT'S NOT TOO BIG OR TOO SMALL.IT WILL FIT INTO MY POCKET WHEN I DON'T WANT TO CARRY A PURSE. THE ATTACHED KEY RING IS A NICE BONUS. EVERYTHING IN PLACE IN ONE SMALL OURSE. NOTE: PURCHASED AT AMAZON. AND I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT. NICE FOR THE PRICE. THANKS AMAZON"
2,"Great product, bad material","The concept of the butter keeper is fantastic, and if I had selected a ceramic product, this review would have been five stars. The marble material, while a beautiful addition to my kitchen, is, unfortunately, porous. This causes the water in the bottom portion to slowly seep out and create mildew on the bottom of the container. Although this problem leads me to give this particular butter keeper two stars, it still does the job of keeping my butter fresh and spreadable for weeks. I will be looking for a ceramic version that should solve the issue."
4,Butter Keeper works.,The butter keeper works well. The tip I found on line for adding salt to the water fights mold. Haven't had any mold.
3,"Great product, arrived broken","This really is a very nice product--when the two parts are intact, that is. I sent one to my sister as a gift; it arrived broken. I ordered one for myself; it also arrived broken. Reason? Complete lack of any kind of cushioning inside the shipping box. Someday, I'll buy an unbroken one in a store, because I do think butter keepers are wonderful things for someone who, like me, regards bread as a mere vehicle on which to slather lots of soft butter."
1,Shipping problem!,"Got my second butter keeper today, but unfortunately, for the second time, it was broken. Packaging was poor and needs to be improved! Product looks great, but I will try to order from someone else. Already had several porcelain ones, but seem to never hold up -Love the concept and it works well, just need to get one that isn't broken!"
2,Worked for a year....,"I really liked this French Butter Bell for about a year, but it is no longer keeping the butter fresh. In spite of following care and washing instructions, I spotted small spots of mold on the butter and the butter had an off smell. I wonder if the marble being porous is the problem. Perhaps a ceramic french butter bell is the answer."
1,"Quality issues, price not reflective of quality","The quality of Sin in Linen products is in decline. They used to use great fabrics and have the latest styles. The workmanship was pretty perfect. The last few things I have bought have had problems with the hem being sewn correctly (straight on a straigh edge), coming loose (had to fix it myself) and the fabric is not the thick, dense quality it used to be. This is my third (and last) disappointing purchase from SIL. Not to mention that they used to have unique images/ideas and now they have pretty much been run into the ground (same pin up girl design, skulls on every-freakin'-thing). No imagination anymore."
5,"A ""who knew"" accessory","I have an older version at work that I've used for years and years. It's one of those products (like AcrobatAdobe Acrobat Standard 9) for which you find a dozen uses after you have it, that you'd never think of without it. Aside from the obvious, you can use it to fill in printed forms; I have a list of seven people who get envelopes every week, by printing the labels as a group I insure I don't forget one; I use it to label my backup tapes; when someone walks in my office and says, ""do you have joe's telephone number"", I copy and paste into my label writer and hand it to him or her.The only slight issue I have with the software is that (as far as I know) it won't do Last, First name labels. So I have to do a quick additional step to make my file labels."
5,Love it !,"I have the turbo 450 and love it. It contains an address book and as you print an address label, you can save it to the address book. It was super easy to print off labels last year for Christmas cards. I've found more uses for it and am constantly printing labels for items. Downloaded the software and never had a minute of trouble with it."
2,Rarely works - prints garbage and wasted lot of labels,"I was really looking forward to using it as gives me the option to print mailing labels professionally but now after 2 months, I have wasted more time and money to make it work than it has printed labels. Prints all sort of garbage even after installing latest v.8 software/driver - tried all tricks avaialble on the the support site too. FYI - I am tech savvy and have all sorts of gadget and I know how to make things like this setup.Stay away from it if you can."
4,heavier and larger than it looks,"I got this as a gift for a friend who loves monkeys. Its very cute, but larger than the picture looks. Heavy too. Better for a larger kitchen I think. Very bright silver too. A fun conversation item."
2,"Too tall monkeys, Too short bowl","Love the look in my kitchen however, the bowl does not hold much fruit as it is not deep enough and the stand itself is just too tall to sit on counter under cabinets so it limits where you can place it. ( reason for only 2 stars from me ). Overall it's fun and attractive."
3,banana/banana peel holder,"This banana/banana peel holder is wonderful. Tired of throwing away peels, simply put them on this rack and you can watch the putrescence take place in about a day. Most mosquitoes love a dry peel and hover around it incessantly. Not much else this can be used for unless mangos come with peels or you are in need of a fake microphone."
3,Sticks to Itself too Easily,"I ship out many items each week and always need shipping tape. I saw a deal for this tape and jumped on it. Scotch Tape is usually the most expensive so I don't get it, but I always imagined it was the best, after all I grew up using good Scotch Products. The basic problem I had with it was when I picked it up to cut some off, a large section of it would quickly roll off, many times to the floor! Then I had to try to save it for the length I needed and it would stick to itself. I never have this problem with other tapes. It does hold up on the box after applied, so I gave it 3 stars. It was very frustrating and I would never get it again."
1,"This tape is junk, does not stick","I paid extra for this thinking it's higher quality, the tape itself is thick and nice. BUT it has NO stickiness. The thing peels so easily after a few days, almost falling off by itself. It's as if the manufacturer forgot to add glue to the tape.It's utterly useless especially for heavier shipping boxes. I ended up using the regular tape at half the cost and they stick very well."
5,Very Good Packing Tape,"Strong tape. Has great strength and stickiness. Good price, great product. I bought this to tape large heavy boxes for moving from an apt to my new home."
1,Tape does not stick!,"I'm usually very happy with Scotch products, but this tape is useless. All tape has to do is stick - and this fails! Is it really that complicated to produce tape? Scotch needs to revisit their Product Quality Dept."
3,"Decent Product, Slow Delivery.","The sandals fit well, and were in good shape. It took me over a week to get them, one of the slowest delivery times for any product I've ordered via marketplace. Individual sellers got my product to me more quickly. I'm not incensed about it, just telling the truth."
1,Very disappointing,"I expected more from both New Balance and Footlocker. This is very poorly made and the sizing is off - way too small. Also, I attempted to exchange these for a different brand, but instead got a portion of my money back, no exchange. Very, very disappointing. I will not shop Footlocker online again."
3,NB Men's Sandals Royal/ White & White/Green,"The sandals fit pretty good on my feet. However, the top cover where the NB logo is feels very uncomfortable in the Instep after wearing them for a while. Probably, I should wait for the sandals to break right in so they can get adjusted to my feet. Having been a New Balance product user for as long as I can remember, it truly surprises me that this particular product does not fit to perfection given the fact that New Balance Products are Top-of-the-Line and above the rest."
3,Buckle up for Fast & the Furious - R.L.Stine style,"Creative and original, The Haunted Car certainly offers a different kind of horror story to the Goosebumps collection. The creepy car which comes to life by a mysterious ghost is definitely spine-tingly, but the climax becomes routine and lackluster. This underdeveloped story seems shorter than other books in this series, but still provides the reader with a new twist on R.L.Stine's classic horror series."
5,WICKEDLY AWESOME!,This book is about a faimly who moves into a new home and their son who likes cars. When the kids dad buys a new car the kid is happy but then the kid starts finding something scarey about the car! I really recomend this book if your not a chicken!
3,"Good, but some problems....","This book to me is one of the duller, less scary Goosebump Books. If you do not like the scares, this book is for you, but the problem was that the story was too short.... not enough info to be good."
2,From Back Cover,"Dillon Gallagher felt secretly responsible for Hayley Alexander's husband's death, so to quench his guilt he hired her as a housekeeper. It was the perfect plan...until it backfired. The tough traveling newsman found himself changing diapers while his ""housekeeper"" was tearing down walls instead of fixing his dinner. Dillon tried to trade sly winks with the neighborhood fellas, but sexy Hayley was turning his stately colonial into an all-too-cozy matchbox. The next thing Dillon knew, he'd agreed to marry Hayley with none of the usual benefits! Only then did he begin to wonder if his poor little widow of a wife didn't have some ulterior motives of her own."
1,?????????,"Useful only in trying to comprehend the origins of the greatest humanitarian disaster in modern times,so far."
1,More suitable as fuel for your fireplace,"Any reviewer who finds a smidgeon of merit in this crazy excuse for rational thought needs to have his own head examined. Bigots and fascists are always looking for some sort of intellectual basis for their beliefs and have for 70 or 80 years tried attempted to find it in Rosenberg's tortured and barren prose (along with Hitler's equally crazy ""Mein Kampf""). Albert Speer, an intelligent and broadly educated man who was Hitler's architect, close associate, and armaments minister, declared the book ""unreadable"" (see ""Inside the Third Reich,"" a vastly more worthwhile book). Anyone who wants to see what this kind of thinking, when adopted on a large scale, can ultimately lead to should watch ""Schindler's List."""
5,Great gift,Was a gift for my Father-in-law who is a car lover. He enjoyed the video and found it very informative
1,Keep Looking,"I bought this based on the reviews here at Amazon. This book presents some good ideas, most of which are intuitive, and in totality makes for a decent desk reference for the cartographer. However, as someone else has pointed out, the formatting of the information on the page is unimpressive and I would add, confounding and hard to read.Most of the example maps in this book are black & white, and somewhat randomly placed in a sea of white space. After reading I'm still wondering what the author is trying to say with his stylistic choices. In either case it certainly weakens Krygier's point of view on 'a Visual Guide to map Design' imo. 'General mapping ideas presented in a pseudo-minimalist fashion' would make for a better title. Props for including a nude though.-> Buy one of Brewer's books, you won't be disappointed."
2,Very limited in scope,"This is not a bad book, but the title and description bear almost no relation to its content. The audience of the book seems to be people who have occasional use for maps, but don't need a very professional product. The text is limited to thematic map design; there's very little about how different map projections work or how geographic features would be represented. There is consideration of some design elements, but the examples used were very limited in scope and somewhat artificial. Finally, there's almost no information about GIS, other than that it exists and can be expensive."
2,Review,I thought that I needed it for my class but it was pretty much useless. The book doesn't help at all.
1,"ahh, now i have log to throw on the fire","Put simply, this book is terrible. The lack of examples throughout the text keeps those without prior knowledge of the subject from fully grasping the concepts. Dr. Lewis failed miserably with this book. Please do not purchase it unless you would like very expensive fire wood."
1,Poorly Presented!,"Maybe he's good at this, but he can't communicate it.I'd rather get a text which enlightens, not mystifies.I do this in industry for a living, and it needs tobe very simple to operate and maintain - or it'llnever get into the marketplace. ""Keep It Simple, S"".Books by Alan Cooper (the creator of Visual Basicand a past winner of the MICROSOFT Geniusaward) are best. THE INMATES ARE INCHARGE OF THE ASYLUM is very accessible."
1,I can't believe it costed me $60 for this book,"I'm a Santa Clara University student, and I'm in the class taught by the author of this book. I'm an experienced programmer who knows PHP, ASP, Java, VBA, and some C and C++, and I must say, this book is very confusing to follow. It offers very little examples and explinations; the accompanied cd-rom doesn't make it easier at all. You won't be able to understand half the slides presented on it without him physically explanining it in front of you; even if you were in his presence, you'll still have a big ? mark on the top of your forehead. For those who enjoy the 'hello world' approach, don't bother with this book; the only words you'll be seeing in the end are 'hello class repeat'. I'm very sure there are other books than this that can teach assembly more fluently."
4,If you are interested in architectural lettering...,"If you have ever wondered how architects and designers form such uniform letters, this is an essential reference. It is one of few books that focus on the beauty of written forms presented on blueprints.Outside, the book has a simple cover. Inside, every page is filled with the author's handwriting; the letters are incredibly consistent from page to page.Although the author presents a limited variety of alphabets, she offers many pointers on how to perfect them. This is clearly a case where quality received a greater emphasis than quantity."
1,Low Quality not worth the price,"This Mascot Precision Tools Magnifier Head Strap w/Light isn't worth the price. The price makes it look like might be a better quality. It isn't. The construction is cheap-battery doors easily fall off, plastic is thin. Lights do *not* point to the subject viewed through the lens. Lens are of reasonable quality but headband is very uncomfortable. I would not recommend this product."
4,An Exciting Restatement of Theology for the Contemporary Wor,"Professor Badham has written a vital and impressive account of the importance of the liberal Christian tradition and its relevance today. Full of the enthusiasm for which he is reknowned, Badham explores various areas of contemporary belief and life and relates them to classical expressions of Modernist theology. He clearly expresses the case he wishes to make, and the way in which ideas considered outdated a generation ago are now becoming important again and returning as valid answers to today's concerns. Whether one agrees with his conclusions or not, this book should be required reading for anyone interested in the place of Christian theology in the contemporary world."
2,micky mouse copper tshirt,"WAY too small, didn't only run small but two-three sizes small! It looked more like a little girl shirt than an adult one."
5,Missing the point,"N.Simpson is missing the point entirely. Bill heaped praise on Lonnie yes, but he wasn't dissing Charley Patton. He said that the recording quality was so bad that it is hard today to hear how brilliant patton was."
3,"Good documentary, but....","A good documentary, but I don't know how Mr. Wyman can laud praises for the recordings of ""skiffle"" artist Lonnie Donegan in one segment and poo-poo the recordings of Charley Patton in another. Without Charley Patton, the blues as we know it would not exist."
2,worked for a while,I liked the space saving but after a couple months of use I started having problems with it retracting.
1,This thing sucks.,"they advertise this like it's a usb port but it's not. I take responsibility for not doing my research, but damn."
1,Not in the Best Shape,"The book is separating from the Spine, I was very disappointed. I looks like it could break in half at any given moment. It is a think book so it is understandable, I just wish it would of been mentioned that it was not in good shape. I guess if you just look at it it probably appears fine yet when you open it you can tell it has had a hard life. Irritated because I probably won't be able to pass it on."
4,Great set of b-sides,"Not as good as Electrelane albums with original material, but this includes ""I'm on Fire"" and a version of Roxy Music's ""More Than This"" that are both more than worth the price. They just keep getting better."
4,This series is asking for trouble,"Personally i liked negima, although i haven't read much of the manga. I is truly a hilarious series to read. the manga is far less modest than tha anime though. i can't really tell you that much except it is pretty good. it's kind of a cliche straigh from harry potter, fells like harry potter got indegestion."
1,"It's not a plot, it's a scene set","So, what we have here is a scene. Take a 10 year old boy, surround him by girls, then spend 200 pages recycling the same dumb stuff to show off undies and boobs galore.Now, it's not that I am anti-fanservice. It's usually just a side note to some plot, and that's okay. But when it's taking the /place/ of the plot, it gets problematic. It seems like every five pages, one of the teenage girls is tripping over something so they can sprawl over Negi.Several times, I contemplated just giving up reading it entirely, but I'd already invested time in it so I stubbornly persevered. I will not be following the rest of this series."
3,The viewpoint from a Japanese,"A lot of women's naked body is drawn on these comics.It is describing, even if it is a scene without the necessity of exposing the female skin.This comic price is about 4 dollars(390yen) in Japan."
1,horrible,This is one of the worst mangas I have ever read it is so boring. Its about kids at school want to know something amazing I go to school everyday and they dont make that into a manga. So dont read this manga it is absolutely horrible.
1,If I could give less I would...,"The book is a watered-down version of basic Stanislavski principles. Ms. Shurin purports to have moved beyond the Method, but her book shows that she has little understanding of the very thing she says she has moved beyond. Her classes are embarrassing and unhelpful. Just take a look at some of her video clips on YouTube and you will see what I mean. CHARLATAN!"
5,What is not to love??,"A remarkable soundtrack from Jerry Goldsmith that gallops along at full symphonic speed. This is vintage Goldsmith in full Americana mode, often tipping the hat to Copland. In my opinion, one of his top ten soundtrack gems!"
3,"Be warned, this is strong stuff","This film has a few comic moments but it has a very dark theme that in no way relates to a normal coming of age film. It is powerful and is a work of art but the director makes his mark on us by crossing many lines, making a film that frankly could not be shown in any public theater I know of. It is a work of despair. Heavy use of symbols to code whether something is actual or imagined. The main theme is the harm done to childhood both by the social environment and by genetic and abuse-caused brain damage. There are scenes of both child and animal abuse.This is the second and last film from this director, who died in a small plane crash soon after this film was finished."
3,So So,Too small. I am afraid that the stitches on the bag are going to come off soon. Do not pack tight. Website doesn't allow to pick desired colour.
5,Excellent!,This is a must have book for any true crime lover or those who study crime and the criminal mind. Excellent reference book.
4,Great descriptions but limited coverage,"I brought this book with me on a recent trip to Paris, the Loire valley and Brittany. Whenever we could, we used the recommendations for places to go and stay and eat from the book and never came away dissapointed. The book does a great job of getting you to the best sights and avoiding the crowds.The only bad thing I can say about it is the coverage is not very good. There are many cities that there is no information on making this not a good resource for answering the question ""Gee, I wonder what is in this little out of the way town we are driving thru"". If you stick to the big sights however, this is not a problem. You can also use this book to determine what the big sights are."
5,Great guide,"We just returned from France...this book was great. He is on the nose with most things Rick Steve also has audio tours that you can download from Itunes (free). They were really helpful, so that one doesn't get inidated with art in the Lourve and Orsay. The Lourve is undergoing some construction and so some of the direction was off (but really Rick can't predict that)...but if you're able to locate the location using the map, provided by the Lourve, you should be fine, and still use his audio recording. We also went to Lyon and Beaune and his book was helpful for those locations as well. Loved the book, once again Rick delivers."
5,Such simple truth Such hard lessons,"If you want to see what this wonderful man looks like go to my webpage and under Good People you will see his picture or if the Buddhist page is up he will be there too.Zen Master Don Gilbert is a rare gentle soul. Not only did he write this book he did all the drawings as well. And it was and is my son Christopher who has the patience needed to help me understand what this book is trying to say. I am a tad dense at times.As the inside cover notes: ""Since the world is constantly changing, and we realize nothing is permanent, the fluid teachings of Zen are eminently adaptable to our Western world teaches"".On page 135 the author reminds us that the main character (a dog) named Unk is not so concerned with discovering Reality. As usual, he is trying to find ways to avoid it. Thus I was reminded how Zen and what I believe Christ taught are so important. Die to self. Die to ego. In doing so our eyes and ears and senses are open. And this is ""Life""."
3,Good For Its Age,This is an OLD kit with a few minor updates. This kit originally came out in the 70s and it shows. Its a good kit to start out on and learn on. But the Trumpeter USS Nimitz is a much better kit.
1,Very Poor quality,"The product was very poor quality, came with no instructions except chinese. When I returned, I was charged a 20% restocking fee. Amazon usually has much better quality items. Will not order again."
5,These balls are the best,But the price is too high here.You can buy them at any tennis shop for $3 per tube.
2,beware that these are only 4 cans of balls,I read the item description too fast and now I bought the most expensive tennis balls!
1,Attention!! Do not waste your money!!,"This ""book"" is comprised of six pages of generalities that you can find any time on the Net. It is a clean rip off . That is all."
5,THE Best Coconut Milk,"Maybe being a Thai American has me being a bit biased, but this is seriously the best coconut milk ever. It has the perfect blend of creamy, sweet and salty. I use it in everything - curries, smoothies, sweet sticky rice - it always works beautifully and tastes great!"
2,"just not as tasty, and preserved with sulphites","My husband picked up this brand because it was a few pennies cheaper than Thai Kitchen Coconut Milk, our usual brand. Bad move.I opened the can and right away noticed an ""off"" odor, compared to my favorite brand - Thai Kitchen. I did not like the taste at all, and noticed that it is preserved with sulphites.I will return all the cans he purchased, and continue to spend a bit more for Thai Kitchen's brand, which contains no preservatives. It is so delicious I can eat it by the spoonful straight out of the can!"
5,BRAVO!,I really enjoyed this movie. I found it somewhat humorous in the fact that they literally crammed an ENTIRE series into one movie. and it worked! hahabut the movie came in a very timely manner and in fantastic condition. yay :)
2,disappointing,"arrived in time, but in a very bad condition. the book was desecribed as ""used-good"" but in fact it was not acceptable, the cover is damaged and marked by a chewing-gum. really disappointed"
2,"Poorly made, not worth watching","Overall poorly made film, participants too stoned to make the film worth watching. Save your time and skip this one."
5,A wonderful book!,"Donald Nicholl conveys what holiness means in every day life. This book makes me a better person. I read it over and over, and buy copies to give to friends."
1,Unreadable,"I bought this book with high expectations, expecting to be given practical advice. After 4 attempts I managed to get through chapter one and found it to be dry, boring and too detailed about definitions, the same ones over and over. After finishing chapter one, I scanned the titles of the remaining chapters. There appeared to be no readily accessible help for a reader who is not embarking on a college program where theory and depth is important. I would NOT recomment this book for anyone who needs practical information."
3,Misleading Image - Not a good value for home use,I ordered this item thinking I was getting a set of two spatulas as shown in the picture. The item is actually one over sized spatula designed for commercial use. It makes no sense and is misleading to show two spatulas of varying sizes when selling a single item.
2,Stacey is such a brat,"Most people are saying that Claudia is shallow, a loser or whatever, but I really hated how Stacey acted in this book. I thought she was so immature and I didn't like how she thought she was better then Claudia in any way, because she isn't. Anyway, I hope that Jeremy will open his eyes and see what a brat Stacey is and fast."
3,Okay Book,In this book Claudia and Stacey are fighting over a guy. What I didnt like about this book was that Stacey chose Jeremy over Claudia. Claudia is her best friend for life and and boys come and go. This books gives young teenage girls the wrong idea about relationships ditching your best friend for a boy that you probably arnt even going to marry. They are only 13. If Stacey was in love with Jeremy I mean really in love just no puppy love it might me all right but she wasnt. To me Stacey always gets what she wants.
4,What a great book!,"To me, this book was really written well. I liked the fact that they solved it in the end like mature, responsible adults, because that shows how the author grew up, solving her conflicts this way. Stacey and Claudia have a big fight over Jeremy, this new boy in school. Stace thinks he'll like Claud, and he doesn't...he likes Stacey! They both like him, and well, read for yourself! I'd reccomend it to anyone!"
3,Mediocre,"Stace and Claudia fall for the same guy in this then have a huge fight. To me, it was a little predictable. You may feel differently."
1,This book sucks!,"It was so boring. Stacey steals a guy from Claudia, blah blah blah. The plot has been used in so many other books. Stacey gets a new friend named Rachel. At first I'd been looking forward to the series a short time before it began, since I'd enjoyed the BSC a lot. But this? What a joke. An extremely boring second-rate California Diary is all Ms. Martin offers here. Keep your money."
2,I am sending it back,I really don't like this kind of travel book and was very disappointed when I received it. It skims over the most obvious tourist attractions of each town filling half the pages with photos (of things like a lion at the zoo in that town - like we can't all picture what the lion looks like).It's probably a personal preference - if you like LP and Rough Guide I'd say this is way too glossy and general for you.
3,Not that bad...not that good,"I could'nt wait to see this movie after i bought it till i found out it wasa tv miniseries. Hey, some of these television series can be very good, butin this case its not.The good: Nice to see Christopher Loyd and Stacey Keach....too bad there gettingold...which means im getting old...arrrrgggSome nice shots of the meteors and the space debris comming to earth.The Bad: Some of the acting and the writting will make you cringe, and thatpoor girl trying to get a ride throughout the whole movie .....The Ugly: Its long, has many subplots and they even have one character whobrings in the needed brutal violence....it really did'nt belong tothis type of movie...And watching the whole thing..... i was not satisfied........coaster time !"
2,Spectacularly Horrible,"I am watching the last 30 min of this TV movie as I type this. It is rare that I come onto a website like this to review anything, but you must know that Meteor is really, REALLY bad. It is poorly written, poorly acted, makes poor use of every cliche plot device, reuses the same poor FX shots a good 30 times over... Heck, I think the once-per-minute faux Google Earth shots add up to 20 minutes of screen time all on their own.But I say this- I am also enjoying it plenty. It is making me laugh. I recommend a few glasses of wine before watching, however. It did wonders for me, though."
2,Book Review,"This book is interesting and full of information. The shipping was slow and the book is not an ""easy reader"" since it is very technical and reference-like but all in all, the book is informative."
2,Not that great.,"A decent primer for a completely inexperienced beginner, but it hardly goes past what anyone with basic perception & common sense would already know. And the new edition is deceptive, too - the guy still talks about sending ""demo cassettes"" - it's pretty sad that they can't even update that basic of a detail. I'd STRONGLY recommend opting for 'All you need to know about the music business' by Donald Passman - it's infinitely more detailed & helpful, and is a very easy, yet informative read - you can get as much or as little out of it as you need."
1,The obvious in 250 pages,"This book is about as pointless as majoring in Sociology. Its the most obviously basic stuff that anyone with even half a working brain can figure out. Each line in this book is like a greeting card of lame industry superficial insights like ""there's always a possibility that hard earned success will disappear as quickly as it materializes."" (pg107) and ""Every artist is only as sucessful as the most recent accomplishment."" (the very next line on pg 107)All of this would be OK, in fact I expect it in a book about the music industry. But this book is really just 250 pages of THOSE TWO LINES written in different verse and/or syntax. I think the writers of this book said to themselves ""instead of writing a book about management, lets see if we can figure out how to write the same thing in more than two thousand ways."" Honestly, these guys should be in the Guiness Book Of World Records, but NOT writers of a useful, helpful, artist management book."
3,"Great book, Slightly Outdated","This is an easy read, with sage, yet dated, advice. If the authors were to release a 5th edition, I would definitely give it a full 5 stars."
1,TERRIBLE--there should be a ZERO stars rating.,"This is NOT a Sandra Bullock movie. In this travesty called a film, she plays an extremely minor role. She only shows up on the cover in order to trick you into buying this movie. Don't fall for it.You should only buy this movie if you are an aficionado of wretched writing, awful acting, predictable plot lines, and desperately need some way to kill ninety minutes."
1,Very near the worst movie I've seen,"The only movies that come to being as bad as this movie have all been on Mystery Science Theater. I'm sure this one would end up there if it weren't for all of the violence. The acting is downright horrible (never made it to the part with Sandra in it... I was about to throw up after 30 minutes and couldn't take any more). The cinematography is even worse... some of the worst angles, light/dark problems, etc. I've ever seen. I'm convinced games like Doom took their idea from this movie... there are shots where you are following guns around and watching them shoot people.Another reviewer mentioned that High Schoolers could make better movies... I agree and I'm not so sure a middle schooler couldn't.I found this one in the bargain bin at Walmart... it doesn't belong in the bargain bin, it belongs in the trash bin."
1,A real stinker!,"This movie was so bad it was laughable. One of those where you keep saying ""It's GOT to get better!"" (it doesn't). Bad story, horrible acting, cheesy slo-mo of ""action"" shots - this looks like a very rough 1st cut somebody salvaged from a trash bin. They didn't even finish the last scene! It just mercifully stops. I removed the CD from the player and put it directly into MY trash bin."
1,what a waste of money and time,"Yeah, so I bought this movie thinking it would be fun to watch and it had one of my favorite actresses, Sandra Bullock, include in the cast. Little did I know that so wasn't in much of the movie and the movie was very badly made with little plot and unrealistic action scenes. There was no way this movie has any glimpse of reality strewn within it and that just makes this a collosel was of time to view and a waste of money. Also, this version of the dvd I bought, had a recent photo of Bullock on the cover, leading you to think that this is a more recent project that she may have done before she was noticed in Hollywood."
1,They called this a movie?,"Ok, there's only one negative review for this movie - and that doesn't do justice to explaining how terrible this movie was. I am a die-hard Sandra Bullock fan, and I thought I would enjoy watching any movie in which she acted, but this was by far the biggest waste of two hours I have ever committed. It was so painful to watch I had to fast forward through most of the cheese. The plot is terrible, the acting is an insult, the camerawork and audio is less-than-college-freshmen with their sony handicams caliber. I want my money back on this ohh-so-crappy poor-excuse-for-a-film."
1,what a bummer,"I HAVE SEEN WORSE, 1950S SCREEMING SKULL, THE BRAIN THAT WOULDNT DIE.I WANT MY 90 MINS. BACK!I FOUND THE ORIGINAL MOVIE POSTER DIDNT HAVE SANDRA ON THE POSTER AT ALL, IT SEEMS LIKE A GOOD MARKETING PLOY TO PURCHASE THIS DVD , LIKE I DID. THIS MOVIE HAS HORRIBLE STORY , HARD TO FOLLOW,THE ONLY SAVING GRACE WAS SANDRA .IT WAS A BIT LIKE LOOKING AT AN OLD YEARBOOK.ACTION PACT, EDGE-OF-YOUR SEAT THRILLER, I THINK NOT , IT TOOK 2 WATCHINGS, BETWEEN NAPS TO FINISH."
2,A quick view of Sandra,"I bought this DVD because I like Ms. Bullock. She has very little screen time. The movie takes place in New York's East Side, which is supposed to be a hotbed of intrigue. An elite corps of ex-CIA agents forms a covert terrorist team known as The Hangmen. When the hero finds out about this, he is targeted for elimination, but the villains forget that the CIA has trained him as well."
1,GET THE NOOSE OUT,"There are two kinds of bad movies: good bad movies, which are so cheesy they entertain in a campy sort of way; and then there are bad bad movies like this truly bad movie!!! Don't let the DVD cover fool you. Sandra Bullock is not the star of this movie..in fact, she's hardly in it at all and when she is, she's downright terrible. I'm sure she doesn't include this turkey on her resume. There's not one redeeming quality to this so-called thriller. The performances are all awful; the editing and cinematography are choppy and amateurish; the direction is nil. Truly a bad movie, not worth anyone's time. Shame on you Sandra!"
1,Over-rated by most of these Reviews!,"Yes, I do believe that most of these reviewers have over-rated this film. One star indeed - where do you folks get off with such generosity? I too picked it up because of Sandra Bullock's pic on the cover, but I'm convinced that I overspent - I got it free at the library! I will recommend to them that they put it in the fireplace where it can actually be of some value - little though that will be."
2,Sandra Bullock hit a low point on this one,"I am an avid fan of Sandra Bullock. I've tried to view all of her films. But this one is really awful. Turgid and flawed, without much of a plot."
1,High School kids have done better movies,"Save your money. I bought it, regret it, and filed it in the trash."
1,TIMOTHY LEARY EXPLOITED!!!!!!,"BEWARE! This video isn't really about Tim at all. It is more about the Merry Pranksters than anything else. I thought I would find a good documentary about one of the most brilliant men of the century, the man who wrote Exo-Psychology, the man who served prison time with a smile on his face. This film merely exploits Tim's memory."
1,a real bummer,"Unfortunalty, this film has very little to do with Tim Leary's life, work or death. In fact, it is more of a bad documentary that tries to glorify the Merry Pranksters. The film was made by OB Babbs whose real interest is exploiting Leary's fame to make a few bucks and talking about his parents (he goes on and on about growing up with the Merry Pranksters and yet seems to understand them poorly). If you are interested in a childish view of the Merry Pranksters, buy this film, if you are actually interested in Timothy Leary, whatever you do, DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS!To conclude, it is just a documentary (that barely deserves the title) compossed of footage of the M.P. lumped together in a manner that suggests that Babbs edited it himself and spend about 10$ in the process. The information in the film about Leary was less than what could be found in an encyclopedia."
2,"ZZzzzz...! Oh, is it over yet?","Big, bad, boring disappointment. I thought it and Syd Barrett's First Trip would make good bookends. So I bought both. What a waste of money. A better title for the Leary movie would have been, ""A Day in the Life of Prankster Progeny Preparing to Meet Someone They Never Heard Of"", but that wouldn't fit on the box.The other reviews must be for a later edition as mine includes a--rather graphic--posthumous decapitation of Leary for preserving his head cryogenically. This was later revealed to be a hoax. Perhaps it was then excised from the DVD."
1,Bad trip,"This thing was horrible it barely had anything to do with Timothy Leary, I was realy let down and if you are a true Leary fan dont check it out, its not worth the time, but if your some wannabe acid head then this movie is for you."
2,not what you might expect,"you should know that these are not fat and puffy like most cheese puffs, but thin and crunchy like ""cheetos"". they are also very salty, which is probably the norm for most cheese puffs, but i was hoping these would be different and more healthly than the more main stream cheese puffs-they arent.i wont order again unless they come out with a reduced salt/sodium version. not only is the salt unhealthy but it just tastes like you are sucking down cheese flavored salt!ick"
2,cheese puffs,"i couldnt even give these away, i served them at a partyand when it was all over the bowl was still full, i offered bagsto guests leaving, and not one person excepted. hard and weird taste"
3,Not our cup of tea,"First, the good: These things definitely have actual, honest-to-goodness cheese.Now, the bad. Unfortunately for my family, our palates seem to have been ruined by years of cheaper, artificial cheese puffs. These just didn't taste quite right to us. I gave it the old college try and gradually ate an entire bag over the course of a half week, and they never did grow on me the way I was hoping.They're clearly a high quality product, they just didn't have a cheese puff flavor which went over properly with my family."
1,"Why, Russell, Why!?!","I've been a Russell Wong fan for years. However, I'm deeply saddened that he was a main character in this D-movie. With his head shaved, he proved that he has a nice cranium, but I still think it was meant to hide his wrinkles. I hate that he is beyond his prime.I loved the diverse cast. It was amazing to see ""ROWDY"" Roddy Piper in a fatherly, aged role. Still, this was a poorly-done ""urban drama."" The fighters' moves were sped up because they were not that spectacular. The army vet lead is meant to be macho based upon his aloofness and elective mutism. However, I felt like he filled the screen with what Uma Thurman in ""Pulp Fiction"" called ""uncomfortable silences."" The movie tries to marinate on the theme of honor and it falls flat.Only watch this film if you can sit through low-quality flicks."
1,tennis socks at northwest sports,This business advertises thorlo and other brands of tennis socks through search engines at very low prices. They are false ads. Whenever you go to their website there is no relationship between the prices on the search engines and the products they offer. BAD!
1,Stupid Thoughts from Mort!,This did not qualify as a book but rather is a form of dribble that we often hear from Mort.Save your money and donate it to a dog shelter.
2,"Heavy Duty - work okay, BUT ....","They are heavy duty and will support what it says it will. However, one of mine had the center post welded on upside down. I didn't really notice it until after 30 days had passed, so was stuck with them. It was awkward using them and in most cases I was able to make do. But I ended up giving them away."
3,Hard to put up,"Works, but it takes time to put up and hard to turn the handle. Its a hassle. I bought scissor jacks for my motor-home and hope that it will be easier to raise it up."
