5,Gilmore Girls - The Complete Sixth Season,"More, More, More, just give me more Gilmore girls is all I can say. Does that answer your question? Fabulous, crazy, outrageous, grand, great, I can't get enough of the Gilmore Girls. Why was there not a season 8? I can't understand how they could do this to their fans?"
2,No Extras How could there be no extras?!,This season was a roller-coaster of tediousness and there were no extras on this DVD set making it feel like a jip.Good day!
5,Excellent Season,"Wonderful, but I missed the Gilmoreisms' Guide. I particularly enjoyed the season's finale, it was totally unexpected."
1,didn't receive all disks so wasn't a good experience,"as stated before, we didn't receive the 3rd disk of the set. i was then forced to buy an entire second set so we could have all the disks. From Amazon I was offered a 10% credit which was about $4 vs the 45 I had to spend for another set of disks. Very unhappy with the experience and with the service from Amazon. I am not sure I ever even received the credit."
3,They've Run Out of Ideas,"I own every DVD box set of Gilmore Girls, and cannot say how many times I have watched Seasons 1-5. Season 6, however, is nothing compared to Seasons 1-5. It seems the writers have run out of ideas and are just grasping for whatever they can come up with and whatever will draw in ratings. In Season 6, we find out Luke has an illegitimate daughter. This seems more like something we would see on The OC or Everwood, but not Gilmore Girls. What's more is that the show has lost its spark, its quick wit and its comedy. Compared to the laugh out loud nature of the first five seasons, this season is lacking. I think the writers should have made this the last season and pulled out all the stops. Half the episodes in Season 6 are dull and nothing really happens. Hard to say if I will buy these DVDs or not...the price would definitely have to come down. Here's to a better 7th season..."
3,Not that great,"I don't like the sixth season. The writers of the show seem to change some of the charactors' personalities, like Rory (some), Luke (some), and Zack. It's not that big a deal, but it's annoying. The show has some big surprises in it, some good and some bad. You should watch this season to continue the story, but in my opinion, it's not that great."
5,WONDERFUL GILMORE GIRLS,WONDERFUL STORIES!!!!FOR YOUNG ADULT & ADULT!!AMAZON ALWAYS CAN GET ME WHAT I WANT!!!LOVE AMAZON!!!!!
5,Perfection,"everything arrived perfectly, quickly, and as described. I love this Gilmore Girls so it was great to know that i can complete my collection with a perfect DVD set. Thanks :-)"
4,Short and Simple,"Great season and series as a whole. But the problem lies with the DVDs. Where are the extra features? The features in previous seasons hardly wet the appetite, but at least there WERE some. But season six? There aren't even ENGLISH subtitles!! Sometimes you kinda need them to keep up with the fast paced dialogue. I was disappointed."
5,The show's last good season,"Sadly the Gilmore Girls are no longer what they once were. This is the last season with Amy Sherman Palladino's writing, and it's clearly evident. Hihgly recommended!"
5,There's no better investment than someone else's money!,If the thought of being able to build a fortune using other people's money seems like a dream come true then look no further than Michael Lechter's book OPM. You'll create strategies for using other people's money to leverage your way to financial freedom. And who's better to teach you how than Rich Dad Robert Kiyosaki's personal advisor and attorney! This book is a must read for anyone wanting to become rich.
5,Flawless beginners guide...,"While not an exhaustive resource, this book is easy to read, understand and apply. I recommend it highly to anyone starting a business, expanding an existing business or in need of capital for growth."
4,OPM: Other People's Money,"A true entrepreneur knows how to leverage other people's ideas and other people's money to create more wealth for everyone around them. Michael Lechter has outlined several ways to bring other people to the table to combine their investments with yours.It's not the easiest read on the shelf. But, the content is great and the information is on the money."
3,Not a bad read,Not a bad read but nothing really new or thought provoking either. Buy used version to save money. For someone seeking information on anxiety/panic that is new to the subject this would be a good read.
5,Well written and informative,"This is a good book. It was referred to me by my psychiatrist for OCD. Although it did not address my issues and help me much with my needs, it did make me realize that my problems compare little to some of the issues and difficulties other people have! I liked the book very much and found it very encouraging and informative."
4,My favorite knitting magazine,"This is the first time I have subscribed, but I've been reading and using Interweave Knits for about 2 years. They are a great resource for new products as well as stitch types and yarns. They've had great tutorials on entrelac, lace, and cables to name a few topics. The patterns are a good variety of styles. Often there are a few that are a bit too out there for my tastes, but there are almost always 2-4 that I can envision making. They tend to be adult woman patterns, with the occasional child size or man's sweater. That being said, though, all 5 of the sweaters I have made my husband he found browsing through these patterns."
4,Classic sounds from a master.,"This music is now in regular rotation on my jazz playlist. Great background music for work, dining, relaxing. Very happy with this music!"
4,Very Nice Pan,"This is the kind of pan you use when you just want to heat some soup, boil hot dogs or make a plate of rice. It has a nice weight to it and cleans very easily though it has no Teflon on it. The price was alright and I feel that I have completed my set of cookware. The only thing I need now is a nice cast iron dutch oven. If you get this and use it properly it will last you for years."
2,somewhat dillusioned,"I was disappointed when I opened the package for an Innova 18/10 stainless steel 2 qt. saucepan. It was in a Kinetic box with Kinetic label. Is that the same company? I use it largely as a double boiler bottom meaning I've done little but boil water in it. I did boil some eggs the other day in it. Have had it less than a week and it has black pits on the inside bottom surface. I guess for $19.99 that's the best you can offer. It serves the purpose and like I say, I won't put anything in it to eat. Definitely not pleased."
5,Pots and pans,"I'm going to write the same review for a couple pots I bought for my wife. They are replacing some scratched, rusting (ugh what a thought)loose handles, etc... very old!I researched and found Innova to be the best and that's what you buy for a gift... you don't want to appear to be cheap. Drinking wine is like a truth serum, but be careful, too much truth can get you into trouble."
3,"Good as reference if you agree, not great for learning","As other reviewers have stated, this is a good reference tool - assuming you agree theologically with the author. If you are interested in learning about theology tough, as I am, I would look elsewhere. This book is truly more of an outline with scripture references and a certain amount of justification, but primarly useful as a reference tool. I would be more interested if the author provided more detailed exegesis to support his positions and explained them more thoroughly, rather than just making assertions without fully supporting them."
2,Skip it!,"With all the good cd-ROM led tutorials available from Adobe for examples--what was Macromedia thinking? Even as a beginning Freehand user I got through the tutorials too quickly and wondered where all the universally praised Freehand features were hidden. The examples look like high school student projects; the interface between book and CDROM is repetitive at best and bizarre most of the time. Usually after using even a mediocre computer book, there is a reason to keep it on my bookshelf. After this disappointing and overpriced book, I want my time and money back."
2,Remedial at best,"The classroom in a box idea is a good one, but is very poorly executed in this somewhat weak introduction to Macromedia Freehand Studio. The concepts are good, but the depth of discussion is somewhat shallow and example exercises uncreative. The use of the interactive CD seems unnecessary as it just reiterates everything in the workbook. Worth the introduction at half the price... maybe."
1,ATTENTION,"DO NOT USE THISthe dvd thing causes the xbox to break. when u play games the disk doesnt constantly spin. it reads some and takes break so it doesnt over heat. when it reads a dvd, it must constantly spin. the dvd playback kit fryed my xbox. at most ""best buy""s you can buy a dvdplayer that functions better for less money than the one for xbox."
1,!!!!!!!! =======BEAWARE of Duplicated========= !!!!!!,"I am not commenting on any specific company here. But my good deal on a remote turned out to be for a DUPLICATE and not the ORIGINAL FROM MICROSOFT.There is a big difference in quality , atleast with my piece.I should have bought a used MICROSOFT remote rather than a NEW DUPLICATE.PLEASE CONFIRM BEFORE YOU BUY"
1,Not honest,"The DVD decoding should already have been included inside the XBox. An infrared reciever could have been built-in too, for that matter. There is no reason why they could not have done this. It was not a design decision to not include it, it was a financial one. It's also lame because it takes up another controller port on the XBox, meaning alot of switching around. This is not very convinient, and yet the purpose of a remote control is for convinience.Before the XBox's launch it was said time and time again that the XBox would have progressive scan DVD playback. If Microsoft ever said that it was changed then that must have been just before launch. So instead of having a high-end console and a high-end DVD machine.SO instead of having the XBox be a high-end DVD machine and a game machine, it's just a game machine that will play DVDs if you fork over fifty bone... still, it is an essential piece of hardware for XBox owners."
2,Overpriced but acceptable...barely,"For the price you're better off buying a $40-50 cheap DVD player. My major grips about the DVD are 1. WAY overpriced, 2. should have been part of the package(basically it cost them at MOST $2.00 bucks to make the remote 3. NO OFF BUTTON on remote 4. I really would have liked to have a SLEEP timer so I can watch a movie while I'm going to sleep and not have it run all night 5. maybe it's just me but navigating DVD menus is near impossible 6. some movies do not play at all ""American History X"" (first and only one I own that doesn't play...but then again I only have about 80 or so DVDs)"
4,Sweet.,If you have an old XBOX original and never got this remote for it then there is still time. It's super low cost now and works perfectly on the XBOX. If you no longer play your XBOX you may want to still collect this to give away or sell the thing to someone who collects old console systems because it completes the set. It is also a very low cost and easy way to replace a defunct DVD player on your entertainment system. Just replace your DVD player with the XBOX since it plays them too and now you have the remote to operate it. Why buy another DVD player if you have this already? A very nice product. My son still uses his.
5,Works great.,"My DVD player died. Having two 360s and an old original Xbox hooked up, I just couldn't rationalize a new DVD player so I bought the remote. Works great."
3,why not make a universal remote?,"I tried using a cheap universal remote as one for my xbox, and it does work using RCA codes if anyone is wondering. However since my remote was cheap it did not fully work with the xbox. So i had to buy one of these, I just think that they should make there remote have 3 or 4 functions, because honestly, who wants another remote to keep track of? Any way its essential to play dvds and there is not really any cheaper generics out there so just buy it if you need it."
4,Awesome Remote,"This is a great remote for the xbox. Instead of buying a new DVD player, I can just use the xbox remote. Decent price."
5,DVD remote for Xbox,"This remote really works! I plugged in the adapter into the 4th hole and put a DVD disc into it and it works. Just make sure that the adapter is pushed in all the way, because I didn't at first and the Xbox would not play a DVD movie disc. This kit must be another way for Micorsoft to make more money, forcing people to buy this to watch standard DVD movie discs.This is a must for Xbox owners."
3,Xbox Movie Playback Kit,"This remote for xbox is a 3star out of 5. After you get use to it, it works pretty good.You will have to memorize where all the buttons are when useing in the dark. You have to use this to watch movies bc the controller for xbox will not work w/the console.Now the price for this is not very expensive compared to $29.00 it used to be.I like this remote,it fits good in your hands."
1,Broke after 20 minutes,"My only experience with this product was after I opened it, and started to play a DVD in my Xbox, when I tried to pause it, it didn't work, and it had brand new batteries. I found (after much frustration) that if I smacked it against my hand a few times then it would work for about 2 minutes. I took it back to exchange for another in hopes that it was just a bad unit, but it was sold out so I just got my money back. You can buy a DVD player for not much more than this way overpriced piece of junk costs."
4,A Little High Priced but Good,"When I first heard of this DVD Playback Kit, I was a little mad that Xbox didn't already have a DVD feature built in. I like it though, I don't watch a whole lot of DVDs. I use it for something else. You can use it in the main menu of the Xbox. You can use it as a remote to play songs you already have burnt onto your Xbox. I use my Xbox to play music while I'm on my computer because my computer is too slow to play music and do anything else. You can use it to play DVDs or as a remote to your MP3s."
5,Does the trick,"I've had DVD players come and go, so its kinda cool to have a gaming console that plays dvd's too. Yeah, I know the PS2 has that capability without a remote, I have one of those too. But one of the cool things I noticed about the X Box playback kit is that the remote looks just like the ones made by RCA. I tried a few of the controls on the DVD funtion of my RCA universal remote, low and behold it worked. Kinda a hand thing, I've got to many remotes floting around as it is, so that part was nice. Mine works great, I use it instead of having to re-arrange my already overpacked entertainment center to put in my other DVD player."
3,The How-To Book of the Mass,"This book helped clarify some parts of the Mass for me. It is well written, easy to understand andhelpful for anyone wanting to understand and participate more fully in the Mass."
2,"So-so, and Shallow","I bought the book looking for a resource I could use to teach my Confirmation students more about the Mass, and to further my understanding and insight. The book talked about where in Scripture different parts of the Mass come from, but did not go through all of the prayers and text or explain why we say what we say at a certain time in a certain posture as much as I would like. It was also a little dry."
2,The How to Book of the Mass,"I was hoping this book would provide easy to ready clear answers to questions regarding Catholicism and the meaning of the mass. To me it was like reading a sermon with too much explanation into the history of each part of the mass. I was looking more for a quick reference and explanation of why certain things are done are certain times during the mass,,,kind of like a Catholic 101 or Catholic for Dummies book."
5,How-To Book of the Mass is excellent,"Wonderful! The explanations are clearly written, easy to understand, and informative. A friend visiting from Portugal was very impressed with this book."
4,Who Knew?,"Born, baptized and confirmed into the Catholic faith, I left active practice some 50 years ago. Coming back recently, I discovered there were facets of the celebration I seemed to have forgotten. After reading this book, I have discovered how pitifully little I actually knew, even to the meaning of the word MASS itself. I would highly recommend this book to anyone planning to attend a Catholic service, no matter the depth of one's belief."
3,19th Century HG Wells Like,"A rambling tale which exudes authenticity. The writer is clearly an amateur, not a novelist but one of these late 19th century gentlemen who does what he wants. He choses adventure for its own sake. A lot of cultural references showing the biases of colonial Britain. Fun to read for a while but I got bogged down in it."
4,Keeps getting better,"In this 5th of series, we learn why Edgar was able to leave his home and family for Catherine - and why he could love and respect her even though she is but a woman. I love this historical period, and enjoy glimpses of Abelard and Heloise in the earlier novel and, in this one, seeing more of E. Peters' Brother Cadfael's world. Edgar is so much more than a beautiful face. I want to know him and Catherine even better. I hope there will be more. I want Solomon to find a kosher wife and I want Catherine's son to grow up. I want to hear more talks with their Parisian friends. I am deeply satisfied with the characters in these five books - and I hope to meet the again."
4,A darker story,"I have been eagerly following the adventures of Catherine and Edgar. This book takes them to Scotland, where Edgar has been summoned to avenge the death of his two older brothers. This is a more complex story than the others, with lots of clerical and political wrangling. And yes, I did find the ending a little weak. But the characterizations, and the surprise ending compensate a bit, I think.Catherine and Edgar both continue to change and to mature as they struggle to meet the challenges life presents them. No, this story isn't as humorous as the first one, for example, but it allows us another glimpse into the relationships between the main characters, and also into life in 12th century Scotland."
2,"Family, Two ""One True Faith""s, Catherine and Edgar in Brittain","The usual excellent tale of times, religion, the Middle Ages, this time Catherine and Edgar in his home country of Scotland (during Ellis Peters's Cadfael period).But get a notebook -- many characters, friendly and un- have names starting with A.Lots of geographical slogging forth and back, and a secondary mystery not entirely reasonable.Keep on reading, though: worth the wading."
3,Not as satisfying as the others in the series,"I found the latest Catherine LeVendeur novel to be lacking much of the humor and charm of the previous books in the series. There is a much darker element to Cursed in the Bone that I was dissatisfied to see, although there are some new characters of whom I am fond. I am glad we know more about Edgar's antecedents, but I would have liked to see more of James in Paris before he got dragged off to Scotland! I like the more grown-up Catherine, but I hope Edgar does not become bitter. Don't want to give any more away!"
3,"Newman's books are wonderfully vivid historical novels, but","I have very mixed feelings towards this entire series. On the one hand, the atmosphere is incredibly vivid. I can't really judge if it's accurate, but I certain feel transported to another time and place that I can experience with all my senses.However, plotting and characterization sometimes leave a lot to be desired. The male members of Edgar's family were so one-dimensional and melodramatic that I lost interest in what would probably have been a pretty good story. There were two exceptions: one is a brother who is gay, which at least is one of the nicer stereotypes about homosexuals; and his uncle who belongs in a sword and sorcery novel. I didn't much care for the ending. I think Newman may be getting herself into a corner, but I don't imagine that I'll read any more of the series, so I'll never know."
1,Bewildered and disappointed,"I just finished Cursed in the Blood and now I wish that I hadn't started it. I'm not sure what happened in this latest in the Catherine LeVendeur series but it wasn't worth the trip. Confusing, depressing and somehow totally unlike the previous 4 wonderful titles in the series. Maybe I'll read it again, I must have missed something, I can't have waited so long for THIS?!"
1,waste of money,"It is big and looks cute but it has only 8 activities on it and four of them are teethers of the same kind! His legs are not strong enough to support a baby. My 5-month old has no interest in it. The only useful thing ia a puppet, but you can buy at a much lower price."
1,my -oh-my was I disappointed!!!,"I must tell you that every time I saw this octopus in a magazine or a store I was truly enchanted by him. I told my husband that our 8 month old girl MUST have this toy for Christmas. And as a bonus I told my husband that the age range is listed up to 36 months so our 2 1/2 year old could also play with the octopus. Well, to my disbelief I cannot get either of my children to even look his way. My 2 1/2 year old thinks he is boring and the baby does not find him stimulating enough to play with for more than a few seconds. The hand puppet is cute and we have been able to entertain them with him, but I would not recommend this toy to anyone, especially for the price."
1,NOT genuine bags,"Product description says: ""Genuine Hoover filter bag. ""They sent me cheesy DVC Brand.Not cool."
2,NOT PRODUCT ADVERTISED,This order was fulfilled by B&M Housewares and was not genuine Hoover bags. The bags I received were equivalent to those available at the 99 cent store. The only good and right thing was the vendor promptly refunded my full purchase price.
4,Good Customer Service,Seller rushed 1/2 the order to get me something right away and followed up with the second 1/2 shortly there after. Nice to see there is still a willingness to satisfy the customer out there - Thanks
4,Wish i had bought it earlier,"This is a band that got introduced to me in the eighties when the whole jazz fusion thing exploded in malaysia.I didn't hear much of them after that period ,but rediscovered them on the net lately and picked up the cd today.played it once and was convinced this band deserved more recognition for their work."
4,Get It Right,"It's nice that they did this for Michael Jackson but to have a video box set with videos and singles and not include all his videos and singles, to include ""Speed Demon"", ""Scream"", ""Human Nature"", ""The Girl Is Mine"", ""Just Another Part Of Me"", ""Will You Be There"" just to name a few is underminingg the price alone. Then there's no booklet to go with it, just a box and some sleeves. The Dual-disc idea was pretty smart but to have on the audio CD side only two-three editions of the single is a waste of a whole CD. why not include dance mixes and more remixes and the video edits of the singles?"
5,Awesome Collection!!!,"I am a huge Michael Jackson fan! Everything he releases, I purchase! I remember getting this at the time when it came out and I was very pleased at the hole package. The only flaw I have with this item is that its missing a few classic videos. Where is SCREAM? One of the best videos ever recorded and most expensive video ever. Also a duet with his legendary sister Janet. Also where is the rarley seen ""She's Out Of My Life"" video?..That was a hit single back in 1980. Also where is Who Is It? Will You Be There? Give In To Me? Gone Too Soon? Man In The Mirror?Another Part Of Me? Childhood? and the latest video ""You Rock My World?....Maybe theres a part 2 of this collection waiting somewhere to be released. Michael Jackson is the greatest and will always be. He is one of the few living legends left out there."
3,um...........,"In my case, this product seems new.but it has some problem.It seems that labors make carelesslyit have many sticky thingsbut I finally accept."
4,in car 956,"If you are Porsche/racing fan this is a must have. You are a passenger in one of the most successful race cars ever produced. World champion Derek Bell is your driver and gives an excellent technical review on how to navigate some of the world's best road race circuits in existence.Filmed in 1984, the video and sound are some what dated by todays standards but then again, who cares? You get to ride along in a 650 bhp Rothmans Porsche 956 at 220+ mph! Enjoy the ride!"
1,Waste of Time,"This just simply didn't work.First off, it's impossible to get the cream on evenly, the applicator thing just pushes the cream around. The wording on the bottle scared me from touching it, so I did the best I could manage.Then, I left on for 3 min and tested, nothing. 3 more min and tested, nothing. 4 more min (which was the 10 min limit on the bottle) and took it off with the plastic razor-like tool, nothing!Smells better then the old stuff from my teenage years, but doesn't work any better.Ladies, my recommendation is to find a salon that does waxing and is also near a bar that serves your favorite hard liquor. Pre-waxing do 1 shot for courage and another for the pain. Post-waxing do as many shots as needed. :)"
5,Relationships/Politics/Suspense in One Book,"Reading this book is a journey into so many worlds: the military, the Pacific Rim, international politics, family love and loyalty, Washington D.C. politics, crime syndicate values, etc. etc.The author shows a gentleness and sensitivity that touched my heart....how unexpected in a military-based suspense novel! For a first novel, the insights, dialogue, storyline and overall ease of reading were exceptional.But, best of all, as an avid fiction reader I was sure I knew the outcome early in the book--but I was surprised!"
5,"A Path to Innocence, a Road to War","A definite must read for readers who enjoy an ""on the edge of your seat"" book. Character development and story intrigue is superb. This new author has woven a story as spellbinding as a Tom Clancy, John Grisham, or Ken Follett novel."
5,A great geopolitical thriller that everyone will enjoy!,"I had a hard time putting this book down. For a first-time novelist, Mr. Wemlinger has done an outstanding job crafting a fast-moving plot that is in sinc with today's global political and military drama. His military experience adds a high level of believability to his story and the characters are very engaging. This book is not just for people who enjoy political or military plots. It has appeal to anyone who enjoys a well-told story that leaves you wanting more. I hope there is a sequel!"
5,One of the Best Books I've Ever Read!,"This is one of the few books I've ever read that had the perfect mix of good prose, thoughtfulness, and fun. It gives off a special type of suspense, powered by the continuous diary format, that keeps you from closing the book; you can't wait until you see what's going to happen next! There are tons of enjoyable and unusual surprises, as well as the interwoven subplots dealing with family, religion, school, romance (fake vs. real), and even some adventure that makes this book even more undeniable. I honestly don't think I'll ever read another book that can top off what Brown wrote. I even threw giggles out of pure enjoyment for it. ""Entries from a Hot Pink Notebook"" is a true change from meticulous and dragging prose that occurs in many other stories and should definately be both a classic and a must for any reader. I hope there's a sequel to Ben Smith's Hot Pink Notebook. It's THAT good!"
4,Very cute,I purchased this item for the landing at the top of my staircase and it looks so good because my hall is very small and it matched the ceiling fan perfectly. Everyone that comes over likes it very much.
5,Stott Pilates,"I have had this on VHS for years and bought the DVD so that I will always have it. It is the best of all my execise videos. I rehabilitated myself after a severe back injury as a nurse with this program. It is not a cardio or super strength workout, but my abs are better now than when I was in my teens and I am now 60."
1,Don't buy if you are in any kind of shape,"I do NOT recommend this DVD for anyone who...- Works out on a regular basis- Is younger than 30 (and does not have a physical disability or injury keeping them from doing execises)- Someone who wants to get in shape, not practically fall asleep on the mat.- Someone who has done even the most basic pilates exercises before.The entire workout was based around those stupid bands (which was not made clear, I don't think, by the back of the DVD) and I felt like I was stretching more than ""sculpting"" or toning anything."
4,Deere-Sit 'n Scoot,"Bought it for my son's first birthday, so far he loves it......not a fan of the new review process on amazon."
4,Sit N' Scoot,Purchased for a grandson for 2nd Birthday last month....he is absolutely delighted with it even though it only played Old MacDonald the first week and no longer makes sounds for the animals. He loves riding it around and he doesn't seem to miss the sounds. He just likes the idea that it is a tractor.
5,Most popular bday present,"My son received this for his first birthday, as did his cousin. They both love the tractors, even today (and they are 2 and 3 now). They are a little big for them but still scoot around the yard and the house. I love that the seat flips up, and both boys love to hide toys in the opening. There is a play area under the seat and the animals make noises when they are put in the places - nice touch for kids learning about animals. My son realized a juice box fits on the back *there is an opening under the handle* and he totes one around the yard with him. He loves turning it upside down and ""fixing"" it. I would recommend this for any boy!"
4,John Deere Tractor,We gave this tractor to our son for his 1st birthday and he loves it! He loves the animals inside and loves to hide other things inside the seat as well. I also love the tractor because it isn't too noisy and didn't come with a bunch of small pieces to keep track of. My only wish is that the tractor had a place to rest his feet on when we push him on it.
4,My son loves this toy but...,"The John Deere Sit 'N' Scoot is a really cute toy. My 11 month old loves it, but he gets so excited and tries to run behind it. This is a problem because it is not very steady and tips over onto him or tips to the sides. We've had many spills with it, but he keeps getting back up, and I can't take it away after he spots it... I do like the toy a lot, but just wish it was steadier."
5,The BEST first birthday gift!,"My one-year-old LOVES his new John Deere Sit-n-Scoot Activity Tractor! I have to hide it in the morning or we'll never get out of the house! It came assembled (thank goodness) and ready to play right out of the box. My son is not walking yet, so this is the perfect transitional toy: He can walk behind it and use it for support, or ride and scoot. The music and sound effects are cute and short -- excellent, as a LOT of his toys are getting on my nerves when they play incessantly.Overall, I think this is a fantastic toy and my son and I couldn't be happier!"
3,A book very underwritten about a woman who is worthy of more,"Althoug the thought of writing a book about Jennifer is a big complimet, considering the time that it takes to write a book, the book was poorly written. First of all it WAS unauthorized and alot of the information is not fact, and true Jennifer Lopez fans will know the facts from fiction. And second of all there were a few Grammar mistakes (with names), if you're going to write a book about someone be sure to spell the names right, because these are the important people in her life.Besides that the book was ok for people (not fans)who are wanting to know the basics and just the basics about Jennifer...I guess the price of the book easily reflects on the writing and information in the book...Jennifer is worthy of so much more. Maybe next time a REAL, AUTHORIZED, WELL WRITTEN BOOK!"
5,How I love my dictionary,"I love to use my Rigg's dictionary my grandma gave me. I can look up the words I need to know by myself. When I find the word it is printed and written in cursive. My Rigg's dictionary also uses the word in a sentence so I understand what it means. I love to color in the pictures, it makes the dictionary mine."
1,Do not trust this seller,Do not buy it. I got the cartrige broken spilled out with all over with ink.
3,Don't use Amazon's compatibility checker... HP 96 ink cartridge,"Well I made the mistake of using Amazon's ""Will This Work with Your Printer?"" and unfortunately now I can't review the quality of the ink, because when I put the cartridge in, my printer tells me its incompatible. It fits in there fine and supposedly interchanges with the standard black ink cartridge for my printer, but obviously HP doesn't want you to use the higher capacity ink cartridges on some printers...So I am buying a much better priced no-name alternative and throwing this one out."
4,ink,"Ink sometimes prints with lines (pins are broken), and ink is expensive but there isn't a lot of options this is the most affordable black ink option for my printer"
4,Short Expiration Date,The ink cartridge works great but beware -- the expiration date was Feb 2010 and I bought it in Nov 2009. That will probably be fine for me but may not be for someone who doesn't print very frequently. Just something to keep in mind.
4,It's ink...,"HP makes good printers. This is good ink for those good printers. Unlike some other manufacturers, the ink lasts more than a few pages so it's worth it even if a tad more expensive."
4,No other choice,"Unfortunately, I am forced to pay more to buy the HP brand ink refills. I tried the OfficeMax brand ones but my printer has trouble recognizing the ink levels and therefore rejects them. I guess this is the only way to go."
3,"Short Dated and No ""Retail Package""","It was supposed to be in ""Retail Packaging""; however,it was just the plastic wrap around the ink cartridge. It was delivered Dec/2009 with a Feb/2010 expiration date. Contacted the seller and got a very nice response that sometimes the product is not in the retail box in order to save space. Why didn't they state that on the Amazon product page? The email said ink should be good for a year & I could try to exchange it for newer one. Nice of them, but not it's as it was stated and it's a hassle to try to do an exchange. Would have to ship it back and who knows what I would get next time. I haven't had to use it yet, but will have a back-up ready when I do, in case it doesn't work. Hopefully, it will... and my concern will be for nothing. Probably won't order from them again, though."
3,Ink cartridge,Bought HP-96 advertised as genuine high-yield original black ink cartridge . Good price and fast delivery. Not OEM replacement packaged but rather sealed packaging as supplied with a new printer. Short storage date (Feb 2010) Usually one year minimum.
5,this works the same had no problem with it,"I could not believe the price it was so much less than buying in the store, and it works great I had no problem with this"
3,Have not used this yet,The price was good compared to the box stores and business supply stores. Not much more to say about a standard black ink cartridge....
1,Old Ink Delivered,I purchased this ink in June 2012 and finally needed to use it in September 2012. The date printed on the cartridge is 2007. And I am unable to return this since the window to return expired. I am out $25 because this ink is dried and will not print in my HP printer.
5,HP cartridges,"The product was delivered very quickly in good condition and performs as expected.As everyone knows who owns a HP printer, the cost of the cartridges far exceeds the cost of the printer - that fact gets to be annoying over time."
1,HP 96 Black Ink Cartridge,"I know this is an excellent product, allowing approximately 800 pages of printed pages per cartridge, but so far, I have not received my order. Perhaps the price (only 44% of retail) was too good to happen."
1,Doesn't work in HP PSC 1610 All-in-Oneprinter!,"I ordered this cartridge after checking with Amazon's convenient checker that it would work on my HP PSC 1610 All-in-One. Well it doesn't so now I have three of them and nowhere to use them. The Official HP support site at[...]says that you can only use the 94, 95, 97, and 99 ink cartridges. I should have checked there first and not relied on Amazon."
4,HP 96 Black Ink Cartridge,"Since I still have a single HP 97 color ink cartridge yet unused, I bought the single pack HP 96 black ink cartridge as a spare as I always keep a spare on hand. I usually buy the twin pack from Amazon and never experienced any problem with HP products. No complaint from me whatsoever. Thank you for providing great service."
5,Roll On John! Roll On! You Sure Were Beautiful!,"""I dreamed that you were Joan of Arch and I was Don Quiote"". Yep, that's John for you. Truth be told John was Don Quiote. And he was a Steamboat River Pilot...Oh Yea! That's a fact! You can look that up. John also flew in an old fashioned steam powered biplane...(well maybe not steam-powered). He was of course a virtuoso banjo and fiddle player....And he could roll the most equisite joints ever....But most of all he could capture a time and place in your mind's innervision like no other. Roll on John...Roll On!...You sure were Beautiful!!!!"
5,An American Classic,"When John Hartford released this album back in 1971, his writing talents were at their peak. He assembled an outstanding cast to back him up for the recording, and the perfect chemistry resulted in one of the finest albums from Nashville during that era. Make no mistake. This is not straight bluegrass...it very much started a music category of it's own, to which the likes of the New Grass Revival followed. The music on Aero-Plain stemmed from all the artist's bluegrass heritage, mixed with a youthful injection of the early '70s post-psychedelic southern social scene. If you have somehow missed ever hearing this album and only know Hartford's work from his Glen Campbell days, take a serious afternoon of listening and enjoy both ""Aereo-Plain"" as well as ""Mark Twang."" They are genuine classics."
4,Great Hartford originals sandwiched between a classic!,"The album starts and ends with ""Turn Your Radio On"" and shines throughout with Hartford, Vassar Clements, Tut Taylor, and Norman Blake carrying the instruments to great heights. They are as good as anyone in bluegrass then and today. Recorded in 1971, these cuts still hold up. A little wacky in places but fun. The picking is outstanding and the renditions of ""Turn Your Radio On"" are great. This album inspired me to follow all four of these guys for the last 25 years!"
4,It just works.,"This is my second NexStar 3. I've had a blue one for 3+ years. Very easy to install and has always worked fine.Can be a little tight for older IDE drives, which is why I have them in the first place. Otherwise, no problems whatsoever."
5,beautiful,my mother got me this for my sixteenth birthday with the red in the middle for my birthstone. i wear it almost every day. im almost 18 now and i get compliments on it all the time. :) timeless piece.
2,Forget it if you are tall!,"This item is HOT but if you are tall, forget it. I am 5'11"" and I ""boob-out"" portion of this top was WAY too low -- only the bottom half of the ""boob"" (and about an inch under the ""boob"") fit into the cut out. In addition, expect a massive weggie if you are tall. It looked ridiculous and there is no means for adjusting it. Consequently, it was a complete waste of money for me.If you are shorter than 5'7"", go for it! It is hot and your husband will love it. If you are taller, find something else."
4,Very nice.,"I definitely recommend this lingerie to anyone. My husband and I absolutely love it. The only dislike I have about it, is I have a long torso, so the bottom of the boob section doesn't fit right under my boob where it's supposed to go unless I yank it upward a bit. Other than that, I absolutely adore this product."
4,musician with heart & a lot of talent!,"I bought this CD after having had the pleasure of seeing this artist in person. I do love the CD but I think I was spoiled by having first heard Trina in person. She is an awesome singer/songwriter/storyteller but as much as I like this CD, I have to say it doesn't quite reflect the power of her personality/talent/voice that I got when I heard her perform live. More a reflection of the CD maybe than of the artist or maybe it's just all about the nice intimacy of a live performance vs. recorded music. Who knows. Nonetheless, I recommend the CD for the thoughtful lyrics, great music & amazing voice. But if you have a chance to hear Trina live, don't miss it!"
1,Hoax!!!,"I have the HD AV Pak that is advertised here and lent it to my friend until I purchased my HD television. He bought this HD AV pak thinking it was the same one since they are both supposedly made by Microsoft and was around the same price. Not to mention the picture looks EXACTLY the same. However, he did not receive the item displayed but a generic version!!! A generic version would be fine but it should not cost the same as the original and should NOT be sold as the original item. I love Amazon and have purchased many things from them but this is very disappointing."
4,"Whoa, Wasn't Expecting That","I love this song, and the video, and heck ... I love the Beastie Boys. I purchased this CD for my private collection as well as my DJ collection and play it fairly frequently in clubs and bars.One thing I wasn't ready for was the lyrics that you don't hear during radio play. One of the first times I played this CD after receiving it was during an instuctional DJ class that I was giving to a bunch of kids. Obviously, you don't hear any cursing on the radio play version of the song, but, there's plenty on the album version which I wasn't expecting when I dropped the disc into my CD turntables for a bunch of kids. It got a good laugh watching me try to cover it up ... parents were not so amused though."
2,Not Leak Proof,"I own this hose, it worked very well for the first few weeks, the male and female connectors worked well, and tightened up well to my spigot and my spray nozzle... then some workers left it pressurized in my yard in the sun... When I came out the hose looked like it had swallowed a couple of rats and a small cat. These bulges have since ruptured, they do not leak, however, unless the hose is left pressuized for more than 5 minutes. I would not buy this hose again, or at least if I did I'd never trust to leave it pressurized for any lengthof time."
1,bad hose connector,"""crush-proof connector"" broke after 2 months. I the morning I found the yellow handle separated from the hose. My garden was completely flooded."
1,Never again,Never again will I buy anything Toshiba. Within A year the 2 laptops I purchased both went bad. One had to get a completely new hard drive and the other is just plain slow. I have spent over $200 still with no success for just 1 of the laptops. The customer service people are no help and is constantly disconnecting the calls when trying to get help with my problems. The extended warranty was a waist of money as was my purchase of these 2 pieces of garbage. Save your money and headaches.
1,three motherboard failures! USB out! cmos passwords! slow!,"Worst notebook I've ever owned. Slow, Vista-only support, 3rd motherboard...failed again. No USB ports working...had to add a cardbus USB...which is slow.All I can say is it was cheap...there is nothing else good about this thing."
3,Cute and Comfy,They are cute and comfortable. I would size up - They fit - but are a bit snug. I like them.
1,Made panty lines,"Sent them back because they made panty lines, which I guess makes them a flawed fit, despite the advertised name."
5,This book is AWESOME!!!,"Randall Arthur has once again brought Jason Faircloth back in a book that everyone must read. The plot is gripping and the wisdom woven through the book is eye-opening. Mr. Arthur clearly shows the effects of spiritual abuse by churches and reminds us that we, like Christ, should love, forgive, and help those in need instead of our current judgemental attitudes that only lead to more hurt. I wholly recommend this book."
2,Not the best self-tanner,"I am a HUGE SkinCeuticals fan and use many of the products from the skin care line. However, this is a weak link in their offering IMO. Unlike other self-tanners, I found this one wore of unevenly, leaving an unattractive ""splotchiness"" (glad I tested first!). Perhaps I did something wrong, but I have used many self-tanners and found this one the least successful in terms of both color and even-ness. I do recommend Clarins, though I've never used the gel (here): Clarins Self Tanning Instant Gel. That said, I highly recommend any of the following from SkinCeuticals, all of which I have found to be excellent products: SkinCeuticals C E Ferulic - 1 oz,SkinCeuticals Hydrating B5 Gel - 30 ml, SkinCeuticals Daily Moisture - 60 ml, SkinCeuticals Intense Line Defense - 30 ml, or almost anything in the skin care department."
1,Disappointed With the Tennis Ball Machine Drills,"When I bought this book I was hopeful that the chapter on the Ball Machine drills would help me to use my new ball machine more efficiently. I was disappointed by the fact that the chapter was geared for more than one player and the machine, rather than just one player and the machine. I believe that most of the drills can be revised so that they work with just one player, but it didn't really contain what I was looking for. I didn't feel there was that much value added to when I go out with the machine before reading this book."
5,Great guide book!,"Simple, easy to understand! Tips, suggestions, and solutions for beginners, amatures, and profs alike. I am totally pleased with this book. I also purchased the Digital Photo Hacks book by the same author. Great book too! Expands on whats in the guide book and adds even more!"
3,Good read for beginnners,"This is a good read if you are just beginning photography. It's small size makes it a good field reference tool for beginning photographers and provides a lot of basic information, but does not really go into detail.More advanced photographers will not find anything new in this book; it truly is for beginners."
3,Not Terribly Bad......,"I found the manual a bit too generic to really serve my need. I am just getting into photography and picked up a couple of books for help. This one had/has so so reviews and it was cheap enough. It really didn't shed any light to any of the issues I was looking for. Check out ""Understanding Exposure"" - I really found that to be an eye opening book that suited my needs to a tee."
2,"Too Many Pages, Too Little Content","Being fairly new to digital photography, I had high hopes for this volume. Having read through the 100 pages fairly quickly, I am now disappointed. I was hoping to find either a very concise guidebook to digital photography or a more substantial work on the subject. I didn't find either one. Instead, I encountered a book that takes too many pages to cover too little content. The information is more technical than practical for an individual new to the field. For someone more experienced, it would be far too basic.I gave this title two stars because it does have a few helpful points. If you are looking for a beginner's primer, look elsewhere. Better books can be purchased for the money."
2,not worth the money,Although this book is o.k. it is only worth about 5 dollars MAX.The information given is worthwhile but far from complete.To charge 10.00 and shipping is a complete RIP OFF.
4,Digital Camera use,The book is good and provides pointers to get better pictures and use of functions. It is worth it
3,"Digital Photography Pocket Guide, 2nd Edition","Short, consiseProvides all basic infoPocket size to allow portability"
3,An Exercise in Subjectivity,"These Amazon reviews are really exhibit A for Post-modernist subjectivity. They show that people can think just about anything is great, as long as they happened to hear it they day after they lost thier virginity, or something. Anyway, this got me to wondering which album it is that I love most; despite the fact that I would have to admit that it is actually not very good when viewed objectively. I came up with the Lucifer's Friend ""Sneak Me In"" album, which is the other Mike Starrs era effort from this band. ""Good time Warrior"" is similar, but I've never developed the fondness for it that I have for the other. There are a lot of terrible records with this same ""kinda metal band does goofy AOR"" theme;(Nightwing,Demon,Mammoth,Fist of Canada, and worst of all the solo album from Jeff Mantas of Venom from 1984). I love them all. They are extremely goofy though. Not very Lucifer like at all. I guess this review dates me as to the year in which I lost my virginity, eh?"
4,I knew going in...,"I knew this was bought for ONE song, as I had the album a long time ago, but this is what happens when you dont download mp3's"
5,Beauty by the Book,"So much pain and bitterness from my past has blocked me getting very far in my Christian walk. There's much to let go of and so much to lay on the altar. After reading your book, I believe I can with His help. My heart is lighter than it's been in years. There was so much you wrote that I was able to connect with.... from families that were ""different"" than the others, to hatred for my body, to not appreciating my uniqueness, to feelings of unworthiness..... all this garbage was playing over and over again and kept me from being the daughter He created me to be. Wow. Thanks so much for hearing and obeying in the writing of this book!"
4,A great guide for beginning birders and children,"This was either the first or second bird guide I ever owned. It's a birding guide that contains the most common species of birds that you'll see. The maps are good, the drawings are excellent, and the information on each bird is great. Greater starter guide for beginners and children."
3,Disappointment,"The original of this book, in hardcover, is fabulous. Unfortunately, this edition is not true to the colors of the birds. Compare for instance the Indigo Bunting in this updated edition with the Indigo Bunting in the original Hardcover Version (not the original paperback version which is just as bad as this). We have Indigo Buntings at our feeders every year. Their color is so vivid, it's breathtaking. But you wouldn't know it by looking at this poor substitute for the original book."
3,FYI,"Just wanted to pass along that this book is only approximately 3"" wide by 6"" long. When it arrived, I was very surprised to find out that the book was so small."
5,Golden Guide to Birds,"I already have this book and use it often. The information is written understandingly and the pictures are very good. When my son requested a bird book, I immediately went for this one."
4,Very good and informative,It was very informative for new birders like me. I give it definately ****(four stars). I highly reccommend this book and others to people new to stuff like this. Its good!
1,"SAd, sad, sad","I already had an Olympia Brass Band CD and loved it. I bought this one and it was absolutely nothing like the first one...the band is more crap rock than anything. There is talking over the music. The guy who sings, does so off tune..it is all very sad and if you are a jazz fan in any way, shape or form. I DO NOT RECOMMEND this!"
3,Buried Lives,"This book is about Joy Bard, a woman who struggles to remember her troubled childhood past. All she remembers about her past is that her brother,Buddy, was kidnapped when they were both young. As bits and pieces of memories start to come back to her, the people she loves most want her to stop trying so hard to remember the past. The closer Joy gets to remembering the terrible truth about her brother's disappearance, the more ""someone"" wants her to forget. On top of everything, Joy and her husband Lanny move into a new and unwelcoming neighborhood with awful neighbors. I gave this book 3 stars. The first half of the book drags on a little bit. The second half of the book becomes more interesting and suspenceful as the action picks up. I did figure out who the ""bad guy"" was after a few chapters into the story. This book wasn't the greatest book I've ever read, nor was it the worst. It was average."
3,Some of what she writes is so profane it's almost funny,"When I was a child, I had checked this book out from the library but only read half of it. Since then, I looked all over the place for many years, trying to find it again. Only recently did I remember the name and finally purchased this book online. The problem with this story is that the writing is geared toward a younger audience, yet some of what she writes is so profane it's almost funny. The suspense is good in the first half, and you are lead on a good chase during the final moments of the story, but somewhere in between the suspense dies and a large curtain gets dropped on you, revealing what you suspected in the first place. Maybe if she had put more time, this could have been a really good story, but as I see fit from what I read, giving 3 stars is just being polite."
2,not that great,The seller was great with the shipping and all other related costs. I'm not impressed however with the cheap plastic construction of the product. The picture and engineering do not do it justice. I was expecting a stronger more rugged model. This item falls apart easily when removing and storing your glasses and sunglasses. There isn't a spring mechanism- just a plastic catch. It also takes a bit of concentration to re-assemble which isn't advised while driving.
2,Ok if you need a double holder,"This product seems OK, but rather large and clunky. I don't see any reason to get it unless you need a double sunglasses holder. The holders also aren't spring-loaded, so a little tricky to open. Look at my other reviews for a holder I prefer."
4,Good as long as glasses fold flat,Works great for glasses with a flat profile when folded. Some sunglasses have widely curved temples and will keep the sunvisor from folding flat.
2,broken...,"bought this for my fiancé, he keeps two pairs of sunglasses in his truck and wanted them both on the visor. one pair are oakley a wires and they fit but the other pair are a thicker pair of oakleys, not so much. he said the plastic popped right off. he's kind of a hard sell though..."
3,Doesn't hold the visor well,"Bought this for my convertable to hold both mine and my daughters sun glasses for when we drive in the sun with the top down. It is a 1994 car and the visors are old, but still function. The clip is horrible and keeps falling off my visor when we are still in the driveway. Purchased a new one that was clipped with the wire, but only single. Holds a lot tighter then the plastic clip. Don't recommend if you have thin visors."
2,There are better options,"I grew interested in this item because of its purported handiness. It handles two pairs at once. Unfortunately, the novelty of two on one is negated by the lack of grip. Totally lacks grip at either end. Came off several times."
2,Clips are not strong enough,"I BOUGHT THIS ITEM AFTER SEEN PERFECT RATINGs. but I have problems of using it. the clips are weak and too wide to clip onto my glasses without hitting the nose-supporters. after a week of using, it keeps falling off from the visor, very annoying."
5,Just does what it should do and does it very well,"I've used Ideal wire strippers at work for over 35 years (I'm an electronics engineer). They do the job, last a long time and are comfortable and safe to use for those who will take about 5 minutes and learn to use them properly."
1,"GREAT MUSICIANS, BAD PRODUCTION !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","I WILL BEGIN BY SAYING THAT I OWN OVE 250 DVD CONCERTS. OF THOSE 250 DVD'S , THIS RANKS AS THE WORST VIDEO PRODUCTION I'VE EVER SEEN.I WOULD GIVE THIS DVD -0 STARS IF POSSIBLE. THE CAMERA WORK IS HORRID. I'M SO TIRED OF SAYING THE SAME OLD STATEMENTS ABOUT VIDEO PRODUCERS. I'M ALSO TIRED OF PAYING GOOD MONEY FOR CRAP LIKE THIS. HASN'T THE MTV GENERATION VIDEO PRODUCERS GONE TO REST HOMES BY NOW OR BECOME CAR SALESMEN. I GUESS NOT BECAUSE HERE IS ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF 2 SECOND VIDEO EDITING WITH IN AND OUT OF FOCUS CAMERAS WITH MULTIPLE CROWD SHOTS FROM 600 FEET AWAY TO 6 INCH CLOSE UPS OF PEOPLES FACESIN 2 SECONDS. HAS ANY OF THESE PRODUCERS AND VIDEO EDITORS EVER BEEN TO A CONCERT AS A FAN? NOT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! SO DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS CRAP !!!"
3,a biased review,"As I'm a huge fan of EC's I had no doubt of buying this DVD as it shows a not very known side of EC's, with him usual collaboration through Band Du Lac's mates....Of course the best songs are the ones leaded by...Eric...very good ones are the tracks sang by Paul Carrack....However, The set list could be much better...two famous drummers Ringo Starr and Rogert Taylor should restrict themselves to their initial instrument, not singing...Overall, it is a good DVD, specially for huge fans of EC, like me."
3,Not very good...,yes Clapton is there and Gary Booker but the venue sucks - although the widescreen video quality looks pretty good on an HDTV - I wish I could get my $$$$ back..............
4,Not Bad for it's time,"This is a great classic Rock band. A band I've never heard off before, they've got great compositions and good drums and rhythms for it's time, the recording isn't that great cause it was done way back in the day. But its good."
2,"""ARCO -- Our Name Means Your [Bad] LSAT Score""","I have studied almost all of the LSAT study guides published and this is the worst. It is loaded with typos, omitted words, and various other errors. Given that verbal precision is the absolute key to the LSAT, this shortcoming is analogous to a math textbook with numerical errors. Beyond the accuracy issue, I found the practice tests to be, on the whole, a bit easier than the real LSAT. This may give you a false sense of security when you go in to take the real deal. Finally, the explanations for the ""game"" section tend to be largley unintelligable. The ONLY positive thing I can say about this book is that it is one of the only ones that includes an ""experimental section,"" which means that you get more material for your money -- even if it is patently flawed material"
2,overpriced!!!,"I give this two stars instead of one because I really love the show, but check out the prices, people! At the time of this writing, you can get each of the first five seasons for $24 a piece ($24 x 5 = $120) or you can buy this set of the first five seasons for $200. Hmmmmm."
4,Smallville review,"In my opinion this is the only way to watch the Smallville series. Each week adds to the ongoing sub-plot, if you watch this series out of sequence or leave a long time between episodes, you lose somthing of the whole (in my opinion)I highly recommended getting the entire series 1-5 and watch it in sequence."
4,Good if you are going to start the Smallville collection.,"However since I already own the 4 seasons relased, it is quite pointless to buy the whole pack and double up on the same quality of episodes that you already have. Here's an advice from me. If you are willing to buy this, you should if you don't have any of the seasons yet. Another thing if you can buy this DVD set, either one of the discs in the sets have been damaged or missing. Finally if any of the sets are dismantled, get another one and sell the dismantled sets for qual or lesser value. But yeah, I would own Smallville season 5 basicially because Tom Welling and Kristin Kreuk look exactly like my local TV husband and wife anchors Drew and Nerissa Sugars from CBS affiliate KCOY-TV that's why they are known as Clark and Lana on KCOY-TV CBS 12 Santa Maria, CA. Anyway, Enjoy the sets."
4,Up to standard... Just.,"This was not my favourite series of Law and order, possibly due to the fact Eames was out of action for some of the episodes and I never really took to the temporary partner. Most of the episodes were as good as usual but some of them lacked the creative thinking outside the box elements that keep me interested.Well worth a watch if you're a fan but not a very good start for new watchers!"
5,Outstanding show,"This is my favourite Law&Order; show.Like a lot D'onofrio performance as Bobby Goren, a modern Holmes.Worth the money."
5,Law and Order: CI,"Great! We love Law and Order: Criminal Intent. Very great season. Our only difficulty was with the quality of discs, some would not play in our PS2 and DVD players, they were warped. We were able to get replacements that worked perfectly."
3,LOVE CI,"i loved this box set. i am a huge fan of all the law and orders. dont buy used though! i did, and the box set didnt come with the brochure, full of scratches, and some of the dvds even skipped! dissappointed in the seller!!! buy new if you can, its just a better deal the whole way around. you dont want to end up with a dirty used box set! i know now!!!"
3,New perspective watching all episodes together,"Vincent D'Onofrio is the major reason to watch this show. He brings to the character hidden depths shown in ways that can be missed the first time you watch the episodes. Then you are concentrating on the intricate story lines. Watching with a focus on the characters instead you soon realize very little is revealed about their personal lives in the third season. Still D'Onofrio brings a sense of vulnerability and rage to the screen. This is one of the few series that I enjoyed more watching intermittently, rather than back to back episodes. Packaging is very flimsy and unworthy of the good show. Points off for shoddy packaging"
4,Another Slightly OT Post,"I'm in the UK & frequently buy dvd's from Amazon US & Canada as they're usually so much cheaper than in the UK, as well as often being released earlier. Having recently 'found' CI I'm now buying up the dvd's, including S2 which is available in the UK. Seems strange that it's out here before the US!"
5,Law and Order Criminal Intent,"Fast shipping. It is for a Christmas gift, so the DVD's have not been opened."
3,Criminal Intent - 3rd Year Set of DVDs,"I got hooked on the first season of ""CI"". However, I've been disappointed in the quality of the shows that make up the 3rd season DVD set. Did the show change writers? There's a lot of holes in some of the episodes- for example, a murder is commited at the beginning of one show. The work on that murder is dropped half way thru the episode and work begins on a second, related murder. Several of the shows of the 3rd season have similar disjoint logic trails. Overall, the shows I've seen from the 3rd season are not of the same quality as the shows of the 1st season."
4,I Like It,Law & Order: Criminal Intent is the show where they investigate the worst affenders. I really like this show because Vincent D'Onofrio really gets his character played well. He has a lot of rage when the person being accused is not telling him what really happened. I heared that Vincent has had two fainting moments during set and at home. They said that they might be replacing him with Chris Noth (Det. Mike Logan) from Law & Order Seasons 1-5. I like the third year (2003-04 Season) but wouldn't it be awesome if Chris Noth came back on Law & Order! I would really watch CI then!
2,Mas de lo mismo,"Quienes hayan visto ""Law & Order - Criminal Intent"" Primera Temporada, lo habrán visto todo. Se trata de una serie construida sobre la base de un único personaje , el detective neoyorquino Robert Goren, encarnado por Vicent D'Onofrio, rodeado de personajes que más bien parecen figuras decorativas. Las tramas no muestran ninguna mejora con respecto a las primeras, ni tampoco los personajes. D'Onofrio compone muy bien su personaje, pero los guiones caen reiteradamente en finales previsibles, donde la presión sicológica ejercida por el intuitivo policia logra la confesion del crimen. Los personajes carecen de rasgos emotivos que otorguen matices a sus comportamientos. Ademas, visualmente la serie es pobre, y los relatos carecen de sorpresa y escenas de alto impacto."
2,viola,"Product arrived in good condition, but according to the school music teacher the bridge will have to be shortened and also the sound post will have to be repositioned. I will have to take this to the music shop to get this fixed. It will probably cost me more than the price of the instrument itself"
1,Many better options out there...,"Seller was very cooperative and responded quickly, however the product was lame. It wouldn't hold a tune and the case it came with was, frankly, styrofoam with a soft lining and a zipper. However, it wasn't very expensive, so I can't complain about it too much, but still, buy something else."
5,"Review of ""Life After Abortion""","I love this DVD. If you have any questions regarding what abortion is really all about and how it affects both men and women, this DVD tells it all directly from people who have suffered the physical, emotional, mental and spiritual consequences. It's a wonderful, down-to-earth look at abortion, with an upside - filled with the hope of healing, restoration and new life. This DVD has been a tremendous blessing to me and I believe it would also be a tremendous blessing to anyone seeking answers."
5,Cool Read,"This play definitely surprised me...I typically read new unknown works and this one should be widespread...Action packed, cool description, if you are having issues this is a must read."
4,bought used,book corners were a little bent but was expected for used book. no underlining/markings found (yet). looking forward to reading once i find some quiet time.
2,journalistic superficiality,"The initial portion of the book is a lucid and well organized account of Chinese-American history. The latter half of the book, falters into a jargonistic series of feature stories, which are interesting anecdote, but fail to make any real point. While Ms. Chang is specific in referring to Chinese immigrants by time and place (e.g. ""ABC"" American born chinese), she uses gross and undefined terms for everyone else (e.g. ""Caucasians"", ""whites"" ""white culture""). The term ""Caucasian"" is as meaningless and offensive as the terms ""Oriental"" Ms. Chang fails to mention that the same opprobrium reserved for the Chinese, was also brought to bear on the Irish and other ""white"" groups. It is too simplistic to look at ""whites"" v. ""Chinese"" as a paradigm for a study of ethnic assimilation. As a journalist, lacking historical acumen or training, Ms. Chang ultimately has little to add."
3,illuminating...but,"Iris Chang deserves credit for targeting such a broad subject and I found new information frequently during my reading. The prose, however, was average without much elegance. I agree with other readers that Evil White People populate this book more than is fair. The definitive account of this important topic waits to be written."
1,Terribly biased,"This book portrays a skewed and somewhat racist view of history. I.E. it focusses on the ""white"" vs. ""chinese"". Moreover, at the time of this writing, all of the good reviews come from Chinese people. Take that as a clue."
5,REMEMBERING AMERICAN HERO: IRIS CHANG,"Iris Chang is one of Chinese Americans Heroes. She is a symbol of truth, an advocacy of human rights, and a spokeswoman for Chinese wartime victims.I am very sorry to hear what happened to her. I want to send my deepest condolence to her family. Nov.12, 2004.Ming Truong, Virginia, USA."
5,Outstanding!,"The most important chronicle on Chinese Americans written to date. Iris did an amazing job presenting the vast amount of information in a concise manner. Her book offers great insight on the values and traditions of our people.Bill Lee, author, ""Chinese Playground"""
3,Not a bad pot.,"I like the weighted bottom and it seems to heat evenly. However, stirring with a metal spoon produces scratches."
5,awesome show!!,"Tom Welling continues to be gorgeous as Clark Kent. Lex turns even more toward the dark side. Clark meets up with some nasty Kryptonians. Brainiac appears. Clark loses his father. It's action packed, well written and just plain fun to watch."
3,Season 5 all good but....,"Overall i think this is a great product for any smallville fan. It's got the usual deleted scenes as expected. I was a bit disappointed with the bonus content. I look forward to that every time i purchase a dvd. I missed the gag reel from the previous smallville dvd's.On the good side, Smallville's 100th episode: the making of a milestone, was preety good, yet sad. You get commentary on 2 episodes and it comes with excerpts from the Look up in the sky! the amazing story of superman dvd. Overall i give it a 3.5 out of 5."
4,Great Series & Love Amazon,Just a short note Smalville was always a good series it has come a long way and any for any true Super Man fan it's a must have. from series 1 - 5 was great.Ps. Amazon really works fast i received my DVDs @ days after i ordered them. Hey now that is service.Keep up the good work AMAZONRicky
2,Wishy Washy season,"Perhaps they had certain restraints because they were filming the movie around the same time as this season and Warner demanded cetain plot constraints, maybe the creators of this show had their hands full with the Aquaman pilot or maybe they were just running outy of ideas but the creativity was drained from the season and the directions they couuld have taken the show (100th episode anyone?) they chickened out on. It was like the show was stuck in a holding pattern, affraid to take any real chances. The on again and off again relationsip of Clark and and Lana became laughable vomit inducing. Are they keeping them together for the Clana fans who's average age is 16? Who knows and who cares anymore. It seems Lex and his father have even grown boring.And we won't even get into the over use of the Kryptonite freak of the week plots.This is the first season I won't be purchasing."
5,The Best Season So Far!,"This season really proves that this cult hit improves with age, and it has been improving each season. This season was the best in my opinion. It has everything: Love, Heartache, Betrayel, threats of World Domination, the usual. It starts off with a bang, Arrival, Mortal and Hidden. Three of the best episodes of the season. Splinter is a classic where you see a slightly different Kent Boy. Solitude, where Clark battles evil Milton Fine a.k.a Braniac. In Reckoning we lose a beloved character, a truly heart ripping episode. Very important changes happened in Hypnotic, Mercy, Oracle and Vessel. Vessel, the season finale, left us all hanging, with everyone of our beloved characters in mortal danger. I can't wait to buy this season Sept. 12th and definitely can't wait til season six starts Sept 28th!!! Here's to a Great Season!!""A Smallville Fan for Life"""
5,Great show,"I really enjoy the whole smallville series, and being able to now watch it anytime is fantastic, and it still very enjoyable to watch"
3,No english subtitles,It didn't mention about not having english subtitles...there is french and spanish...but no english. It doesn't matter to me but sometimes it helps
4,All good except vampire episode,All the episodes were great except for the vampire sirority episode. The vampire episode was just a bit too much.
5,SMALLVILLE ROCKS,"You may say that Lana cries to much, you may say that they've taken the mythogy to far, even I hae have said that at different times. But it's the story of a young man who destined to become the world greatest Superhero. Smallville no matter how far they take it, it's a damn good show and the characters and actors work so well together. Season 5 rocks in all asspects, I can't wait for Season 6.......""Kneel before ZOD."""
5,Great series,Bought this as a gift for my daughter who LOVES the Smallville series. Would recommend you ad this to your collection if you are a SuperMan fan.
2,Damaged goods.,"The DVD was scratched, blocking me from watching four episodes. I was very upset that I couldn't watch those four episodes."
3,Season 5 for the Dedicated Fans:,"Better than season 4, worse than season 1-3. Smallville is beginning to lose its charm. Great ending though!"
3,More Presice Information Please!!,"I bought this product presuming that it offers English subtitle but its not, it provides ""Spanish"" subtitles which is not needed while watching this programme. Can they provide a more detailed info on the programme's information? Thanks."
3,Good but kind of like a soap,Some plot development over time but it does leave a bit of a worry that I'm watching a soap and actually enjoying it...
4,great service,I was very happy with this seller. My item was in great shape and new in packaging as promised. It was delivered in a very timely manner.
3,Smallville Season 5,The product was good. The only issue was the several DVD's skipped or paused. I think the DVD's were not cleaned.
3,"Started well, ended well, but everything in between ...","Started with three solid episodes. Ended with two solid episodes. Of the remainder, there are only a very few worth your time."
4,Season 5 was thoroughly satisfying,Season 5 of said show was really good. I loved the interaction between the character and enjoyed the dilemmas faced in each episode. I really loved how they tied together so many lose ends and created more in the season finale. This show is a great buy. Ciao.
2,What happened?! Uncreative and Sloppy Stories,"Mildly entertaining. This season was full of old movie remakes and soap opera themes. My kids and I could not get enough of Smallville until this season. There were some high points, and they can still fix the show next season, I hope. I would like to add that John Glover did an outstanding job of acting as Lionel Luthor this season, and Tom Welling and Allison Mack were great as always. I think it was the writing, or lack of, it that ruined this season."
4,Best season to date,"I am a huge fan of the show and have enjoyed every season, and the further along they bring us to Clark's destiny, the better it gets.I rate it a four only because it lacks gag reels and a show of how special effects are created; I enjoy the extras.Hope you enjoy it as much as I did."
4,Good Performance - TW,"It's funny...I've seen this episode several times already and this last time...when Clark opens the door to his home and hears his father's voice on the DVD...I just teared up when I saw the shock on his face. The plots in the series...because of the genre...may not always be what we as adults want to see...but what really drives this show for me...what really makes it interesting are the character relationships and how the characters, especially Clark's, develop over the seasons. The final scene was powerful as he finally accepted the reality that his father had died...he finaly broke down and cried after holding everything in for so long. It was a great performance by Tom Welling. This is his role...I don't think any other actor would have been able to fit this role so well. Thank you Tom Welling. edited 19 Mar 2011: And it happened again....the ending impacted me again. That's good storytelling and good acting."
5,"HIGHLY RECOMMENDED, A++++++++",LIKE ALL THE OTHER SEASONS THIS ONE JUST GET'S BETTER AND BETTER.I HAVE WATCHED ALL SEASONS INCLUDING THE SIX AND WAITING FOR THE SEVENTH. THIS IS ONE SHOW THAT WILL LIVE ON FOR A LONG TIME.I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS SEASON.AND HIGHLY RECOMMEND VIEWING ALL THE OTHER SEASONS.THEY GROW ON YOU !!!!
3,history of superman,the seasons where good but the story needs a new writer lex didnt even know clark and when he was superman in the movies and just learned of a secret to kriptonite/ he knows clark doesnt like the stuff but 12 years down the road superman is weak th kriptonite and lex a billonaire doesnt remember clark is weak to the stuff pro found dont you think but smallville was great when they fell on the true story line but what am i to say i just have every comic cartoon movie and all of smallville and lois and clark seasons but the season are great to watch to expand you mind on what clark did as a kid teen and the growth of jor-el and kripton enjoy the episodes that fall in great order and the others i wont be breakon out the popcorn
5,Still Great,"A lot of stuff happens this season that makes this worth buying; Aquaman, silver Kryptonite, Braniac and the death of a family member are just a few things that happen this season. Season five is definitely one of the most exciting seasons and one of the most interesting since a lot of it takes place in Metropolis. The series just gets better and better with each season"
5,Smallville - The Complete Fifth Season,"Great series! As the seasons pass, the plot thickens leaving our perceptions of people to change dramatically (as I knew they would) with a great story line. After the season finale I am counting the days until season six is available!"
4,very very good,"i like alot the 5th season of smallville, nice episodes and production...everything perfect but the dvd box... the container of the older seasons is and look beter than the new one. with the new box the dvds may damage easier... everything else is perfect."
4,My all time Favorite TV show,"What can I say, I guess I am a little biased because Smallville is my favorite TV show ever. I am a huge Allison Mack fan, so my love for the Chloe character lends itself to my enjoyment of the show.All in all good season, but it does seem to take on a more ""darker"" atmosphere as compared to seasons 1-3 and even a little of 4.Great buy if you are a fan, and if you are ""new"" to the show, I recommend getting the seasons in order. What can I say I am an ""old school fan"" so seasons 1-3 hold a huge place in my heart."
4,Still a great show,"Im really surprised, 5 Seasons an still a good show. There are not many around who can deliver exciting, surprising and thrilling work for such a long time. My advise, if u are into SiFi, Superman or Comic adaptations at all, buy it."
4,Smallville season 5 on DVD,I'm a huge Smallville fan and I have the entire collection of seasons on DVD. I purchased season 5 and I was highly satisfied with my purchase. The quality of my item was great the price was incredibly reasonable.
5,Season 5,"I'll be buying season 5 thanks to Channel 53 in Columbus bouncing the showtime around and airing it at like midnight. Oh, and ten thousand commercials. Even though it's comic myth right, I kinda liked having Johnathan in Lois and Clark so that's disappointing (but you could see that one comming a mile away). If this gets to any writters, you guys are great for the most part. I'd sure like to see this group do a Lois and Clark series (maybe name it Metropolis). This is one of the best series I've seen. I'd rank it right up there with 6 feet under."
4,"I can't help it, I love this show","I have enjoyed the Superman story in every form. Motion pictures, animation, comic books, etc. Smallville tells an aspect of the superman story which is new. The transition from the boy, to the man, to the hero we all know. Personally I enjoy this show more than I liked the 2006 motion picture. The stars of the show do justice to the iconic figures which came before them. I hope this show will continue to fill in the blanks of the Superman saga."
5,Forget HDTV - HD-DVD blows you away...,"A dream comes true, perfect video/audio quality on 1080p / 24fps , a sensational HD-DVD release of a kewl tv series. Because HDTV gives you only 1080i max. on a low datarate for an HD movie (series)...so thumbs UP... Warner please release more of these finest HD-DVD tv series."
5,Love Smallville,I love Smallville and this was a great addition to my library of shows. I would recommend starting at season one to get the full story.
3,Not a Favorite,"I have to admit I don't quite like the references to Buffy the Vampire Slayer in this episode. I don't like pop culture references being made in a fantasy story which this is. It's one thing when you have a series that's not fantastical....and another when it is. Smallville and the Superman story should remain within its boundaries and not pull from pop culture in so obvious a way as this was done. Nonetheless, I gave it 3 stars because as a fan I hate complaining about this series plus I allowed myself to simply enjoy it regardless of their ""mistake"". So I forgive them though I'm sure many won't."
3,Not my favorite,"The next several episodes were sometimes hard to watch. The evolution of Clark and Lana's relationship is not always pretty to watch which makes me wonder why there were so many fans of the Lana/Clark hook-up vs Lois/Clark. The episodes with Lana are darker and the mis-trust drives me crazy. The Lana of this series isn't always the most likeable character which has always made me wonder why they carried on this storyline for so many years. It is a heart-breaking love story so perhaps that is why the stuck with it for so long. Plus, it is in sharp contrast to his relationship with Lois which, though at times has issues of trust, is the more mature...but most importantly...much more fun relationship. I see Lana and Lois as night vs day...frowns vs smiles....with all that is good going towards Lois. I wish we could have more years of the Lois & Clark relationship from this series."
5,Another wonderful heather graham book.,If you love civil war historicals as I do you'll love this one.
3,"Promising story, but it fell flat","Reading an immediate love scene before any romantic tension is created always makes me feel like I'm outside of the story. It had potential, but I just didn't dig it."
2,"Good idea, poor product","I love Pustefix and I loved the idea of a non battery operated bubble blower. I was thrilled when I saw this product and even more so when I finally received it.HOWEVER, it's not worth it. The mechanism for pouring in the bubble soap is poorly designed. And it drips everywhere EVEN when held properly. It's very, VERY loud. The plastic gears create a whirring that makes it impossible to talk to the person even next you. Finally, this product started to misalign itself within half an hour of usage. No, this is NOT continuous usage. I managed to push it back into place a couple of times but then it slipped past the point of retrieval. Since this is a molded plastic case there is NO way short of breaking it, to open it and realign the gears.As much as I love Pustefix, they need to redesign this product badly. Certainly the worst value for 20 dollars + shipping I've spent in a long time."
4,READ THIS,"The person who said that shetlands are super tiny is right, but also wrong.Most Shetlands are VERY tiny, but not all of them. There are some that are about the perfect size for someone that was Anna's age.I just thought I should share this information. For further info, try google images and type in Shetland Pony."
1,What A Waste Of Money,"I bought this book with my mom because I like horses. I was real disapointed by this book. first let me tell you waht it is about. There are three girls called Pam, Annie and Lulu. They all have ponies who are friends also. Then Lulu must move to africa and Pam gets a Thoroubred Show jumper called Starfire and Annie is too big for Acorn. Here is why I did not like this book. It is silly. They say Annie is too big for Acorn the pony but in picture she fits on him fine. Also, my cousin really likes horses and read all the pony Pal books, and she says Connemiras, wich is Pam's ponie's breed, do not exist! So how is Lightning a Connemira? One more problem: if the book is supposed to take place on a ranch in Collorado, why do the pony pals ride English style? They dont ride English in Collorado! Anyway, that is why I didnt like this book. If it werre not for those mistakes and it was not sad I would actualy like this book. So maybe it aint too bad!;)"
4,"Great Music, but more would be better...","This group is fantastic, lots of energy and great grooves. At times the musicianship is a bit off, but the infectious beat and syncopation make it a joy to behold. My only real complaint about the CD is that it's only 39 minutes long. Even in the days of LP records this would be bit of a skimpy collection...4 more songs and I'd give it 5 stars."
5,The most exciting book I've ever read!!,This book grabs you from cover to cover. Ms. Latt's brillant writing style and her use of such interesting characters make this book the most exciting well written book I've ever read. Move over Mr. Grisham! This was one book I just couldn't put down! A must read for all you legal suspense lovers!
3,I Must Disagree With The #1 Reviewer,"(Sorry, Harriet. By the way, how can you read and review so many books?)Sedately paced, with somewhat two-dimensional characters and mildly amusing dialog is how I would describe it. I find myself reading one or two chapters and then putting the book down. There is no great suspense to the mystery--indeed it seems to be shuffled aside about halfway through the story--but for some reason I keep plowing on. Perhaps it is the setting and the little educational nuggets. For example, I had to go to the dictionary to look up ""logothete."" (A great word that I will never have any use for, but, hey, I feel smarter already.) This is the perfect book for someone seeking clean-cut, casually highbrow, light reading that isn't going to eat up all your time. (Of course, the latter is what we're really looking for, eh?)"
5,Angelic,"Anyah's music is incredible to experience. Her sacred use of many languages, her multi-layered music, her angelic voice make this more than just a music CD. It is a teaching, a meditation, a prayer to the Divine. I sing The Lord's Prayer in Hebrew to my children every night and Detrahm is always upon my lips!"
2,"factual, but intellectually dishonest","Gives thorough, factual summaries about various resurgent extremist groups, but ends up whitewashing the role far left Jews in the Bolshevik takeover and in the NKVD (secret police), later KGB, as revealed in Christopher Andrew's ""The Sword and the Shield"" (available through Amazon)."
5,A REAL MIRACLE TO SAVE MY LIFE WITH,"I have been trying over the last three years to determine if I wanted to continue living, wanted to find how to stop hurting, and if there was a ""miracle"" to help me. I was browsing in the library at the Senior Living Complex I live in yesterday and FOUND MY MIRACLE! Just like that.....I couldn't put this wonderful book down; I read it most of the night and finished it the next afternoon. I want to try the two most important solutions to my problems that I found in this publication. FLAX SEED AND FISH OIL! THE SUPER FOODS! I can't thank Lorna and Karlene enough. Their explanations, examples, recommended dosages are so simple to follow. When I read their charts for symptoms, I was amazed to find what I've been begging to know about for the last three years. Suffering might be endurable, but not very enjoyable. I'm hoping that their suggestions will help me want to endure life, ease my pain and that life will be a beautiful option instead of a milestone."
1,"wrong info, wrong size, long delivery time--bummer!","This belt did not fit. Information for which model it fit was incorrect. Had to wait and wait for it to arrive, only to find it was incorrect size."
4,Best Source for the Belts,"These belts are the weak spot in the Hoover mechanism, so you should lay in a supply because the machine is worthless if one snaps (which can happen easily if you get something tangled in the brush while vacuuming)and there is no replacement on hand. I'd suggest buying in bulk. The price is right and the supplier responds quickly. I give the product four stars because the belts are inherently weak. (To be fair, if they were any more robust they would be impossible for normal people to install.) But I give this source five stars plus."
2,Hoover Windtunnel replacement belts,I am so disappointed. I ordered these twice and both times I received the wrong size. They are too small. This great vacuum I can't use.
2,Bigger Size than the original,This product is bigger in size than the original Hoover Belt. Though the advertisement said it is the original Hoover Belt. In reality it is nothing close to original especially the bigger size of the belt. Unable to use them.
1,Stuck with 2 belts that don't work with my vacuum,"Beware this product is suggested to go with vacuums on the website that it doesn't work with. Check the belt size on the manufacturer site, do not trust Amazon/Seller suggested pairings!"
5,Good buy,I bought this because I was hoping to find them cheaper than they were in the stores. This was just as good as ordering from the company! I would recommend them to anyone.
3,Handy bbut how strong,The day I bought them I had to use one which raises the question as how well they are built? Time will tell. Were there any instructions as to how to install?
1,I got the wrong belt,"The wrong belt was sent to me. I needed 2 types of belts for this vacuum clenaer and the wrong ""one"" was sent to me."
5,Great deal and fixed the problem with my Windtunnel,"This belt fixed my problem I was having with my vacuum. My vacuum lost suction, and it was suggested I replace the belt before replacing the vacuum. Good thing I did- it saved me a lot of money. Great value and free shipping."
5,Hooverfixer,The product arrived very quickly and is just as described. The installation was simple. Now I have my Hoover Vac running properly again and a replacement belt for any future problem. The price was very reasonable. Thanks Amazon!
1,Wrong Belt for the Pet WindTunnel?????,"I am preparing to order the pet windtunnel. The vacuum was paired with these belts as items ordered together. I decided to check the part number first and found that, according to the video manual, these are the WRONG belts. The correct belt part number is 562289001. I'm thankful that I won't be stuck with useless belts and hope this helps others......... and Amazon to correct the problem."
1,Do not buy this belt,"After ordering a Hoover Wind Tunnel UH70120 vacuum cleaner I was recomended to buy this belt. The price was good, but it does NOT fit the vacuum cleaner I purchased."
4,"So far, so good.","The genuine Hoover belts work well when they don't break! This could have been the fault of the vacuum...not sure yet. These belts fit nice and snug and work well to rotate the vacuum brush. First one broke. This one is holding on...so far. Again, the fault could be a snag somewhere within the vacuum unit. (Hoover WindTunnel T-Series Pet Upright Vacuum, Bagged, UH30310 )"
5,Dirt Devil HEPA Filters,Dirt Devil 3JC0280000 Universal HEPA Filter for Bagless UprightsThe correct product at a very resonable price - very happy with purchase
2,note air filters not bags,My mistake but I thought it was vacuum bags but was just filter.My mistake I was looking at picture thinking I was looking at bags not filters
1,Terrible cheap product lasted only two months,"While this vacuum is cheap, it should have (at least) lasted longer the two months! Do not buy this - it should be taken off the market. A total ripoff!"
2,Mrs.,"This vacuum, though having a lot of suction, is pretty flimsy in construction. When the hose is used with the crevice tool, all the dirt, etc that is in the canister comes flying out from where the hose was connected for regular vacuuming. Within a week after buying this vacuum, there was a Recall Notice because of a faulty power cord winder. I had decided before I receive the Recall Notice that this was a substandard cord winder so I stopped using it. Now I just have a loose cord laying around. Nice. I have tried the phone number sent to me in order to receive the repair kit, but the phone number does not work. Having not been able to contact a ""live"" person (nor a recording) to remedy this situation, I will never buy a Hoover item again."
1,Belts Kept Breaking.,"I would never buy a Hoover vacuum cleaner again. Their customer service is the worst I've ever seen, there is no service near by and they expect you to pay postage if sending the big non working plastic junk to them or drive 65 miles to their service center.Never again Hoover.Do Not Recommend."
4,Good fit,I replaced the belt on my vacuum and it worked perfectly. Because of that I didn't have to buy a new vacuum and saved at least one hundred dollars.
4,Hoover agitator belt,"Bought this belt as a back up. I bought a vacuum at the same time and several of the reviews stated the belts broke while ""breaking in"" the vacuum. So far, haven't needed the back up belt."
1,Bum Scoop,Amazon paired this belt with the Hoover vacuum model UH70210. No reason to doubt that Amazon would do such a thing if it wasn't the right belt. Wrong... Got the belts a few days before the vacuum arrived and was confused when the users manual stated the proper belt was AH20065 not this 40201160/38528033 2-pack. E-mailed Hoover and they responded that these are completely two different belts in lenght and the AH20065 was the right one for my model with the beater bar cutout switch. Shame on Amazon for recommending the wrong product on their site.
3,"Dear Hoover, it's 2013 okay?","These things just aren't durable, but at least their relatively cheap. They're also hard to put on, but I guess the blame for that lies with the vacuum cleaner, not the belt."
1,not sure if I get the right product,"I ordered those belts with the Hoover Tempo Widepath Upright Vacuum, U5140-900 because they were displayed on the website as replacement belts for this machine. What I got is two Belts in a loose paper bag, nothing that looks like the picture that I saw on the website. Did I get the write product? I am not sure."
1,flimsy product,I had to reorder the item as the two belts I bought from Amazon for replacement broke in two days. Not sure if there something wrong with Vacuum cleaner or Belt. Since I don't have choice other than to buy am getting it again.
5,Works as expected,"There's not much to say other than it works as expected, as it should being an original part from Hoover."
2,Sucks,This is a planned obsolescence product. Made to brake repeatedly so as to make you buy more of them. SUCKS !!!
3,It turns the beater bar,Not sure what more one can say about a vacuum belt. The technology is essentially unchanged for decades and this does the job.
1,Fraudulent Company Selling Fake Products,"I ordered agitator belts from this company for a Hoover self propelled vacuum cleaner. They sent me drive belts instead. Since then they have told me I messed up, made threats, and defamed me through the Amazon arbitrage process. Amazon made me whole on this without question but if this companies poor search engine allows them to make an order in error Heaven help you with getting them to admit they even messed up. Making it right for you is impossible. My advice is to go elsewhere for your needs. If you expect the cheapest price by 10 cents is your best deal then you will get what you paid for, I promise."
3,Not bad for the money,"These are not genuine Hoover belts, but some generic brand.The belts are a little tight, but so far, are working fine. Been using for about a month.For the price...not bad."
3,good so far,but to be honest only used it twice. I have a windtunnel pet rewind and these seemed smaller than the agitator they replaced and it was SUPER hard to get on. We'll see how it goes but seems to be doing the trick so far.
3,Not in OEM package,Product is not the same as shown in picture.They do not have the OEM packaging.they seemed to work ok so far.
4,excellent product with easy install,I bought wiring kit so I could tow my boat. The kit was easy to install and gave me a professional result. I am very satisfied and saved $ 40 installation costs by doing it myself. It took me about 1 hour to do the install and run the wiring very neatly. If you need trailer wiring for a 2001 Nissan Pathfinder I recommend this kit.
4,Classic Christmas Music From My Past,In the late 60's and throughout the 70's my parents had several Christmas albums that were played almost non-stop each December. There were a select few that we're packed every Christmas Eve and taken to my grandparents house for our big family Christmas in the country and Christmas With The Lennon Sisters was one of them. I finally purchased this classic and now my kids like it to.
5,Memories from the past!,"THis CD brought back so many memories. It is Just like the album we had growing up! Same great sound, and wonderful memories"
5,Great Christmas Memories,"I am so happpy! My sister just send me this CD yesterday for Christmas. I had looked on itunes, but could only find one track. Just listening to it takes me back to the 60's, with that matchless excitement that only a child can have for Christmas. I remember singing along with my sister and never tiring of the songs. I'm not a music expert, but if you're on the tail end of the Boomer Generation, chances are your family bought this CD, or ""album"" as we used to say, and it will take you back the way that music can. I epecially love the campier songs like ""I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus"" and ""Christmas Island"" as well as more religious songs like ""Little Drummer Boy"" and ""Adeste Fidele."" Enjoy this CD!"
4,Good Slice of the 1950's,"This Christmas album brings back many memories. It has what must be the original sound tracks. People forget that the tone and sound of records ""back then"" was very different. I particularly enjoyed hearing little Janet Lennon sing ""I saw mommy kissing Santa Clause.""Not a spectacular album for all time, but a very good representative one of the era."
5,Lennon Sisters Christmas,As a child I listened to this album during the holiday season and what a thrill to find it remastered on a CD after all these years. Their voices harmonize to create lovely traditional and a couple of non-traditional carols that have become my favorites.
2,Disappointed,"This video (the one I received, anyway) was way too outdated. It looked 60's or 70's, and the film quailty was bad. Surely there is a better quality one out there somewhere..."
1,Rayman Raving Rabbids- a major bummer,"I was very disappointed in the game. I loved the first three and have been waiting for what seemed like forever for the fourth one to come out. Playing this game has been a major letdown.I really liked the exploratory nature of the first three. They were so imaginative. This game is nothing more than a glorified arcade with no exploration at all!!! Everything I loved about the first three games is missing in this one. If you are a Rayman fan, avoid this one. It is not even close to being as good as the other three."
1,Not a true multi-player game,"I bought this game because it said that multiple people could play against each other. My fiance and I thought it would be perfect. But NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! First, one player has to go through all the little trials of Rayman......THEN you get to the multi-player capability. WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY!And by the way......when shooting bunnies with the plunger.......RELOAD OFTEN.......otherwise you'll be there even longer."
2,Not genuine Hoover,"Ordered 4 packages of this product. Go Vacuum was supplier,fulfilled by Amazon.Received DVC brand, package of 4 bags, not 3 bags, made in China.They are definitely lighter material than the old Hoover bags.Staples are missing as described by previous reviewer.Maybe the genuine Hoover bags are now flimsy as well, but I have no wayof knowing. If Amazon is going to ship generic bags they should say so."
5,Small and Gracious,pink is very soft so I can use it all outfits. pink Swarowski crystals add a luxury. I love it.I can resize it very easily by myself.
4,Raven Strikes Again,"Raven is back and has a new bag of tricks. Just when you thought she was done, she resurface to wreck havoc all over again. Bad Girls Finish first is a ""I can't put this book down read"". Bad Girls Finish First is a perfect sequel to Illegal Affairs. Entertaining summer read from beginning to end."
3,Not as good as I thought it would be....,"This book has a lot of holes in it that need to be filled. At times I did not get what the characters were saying or explaining to each other. Some of the characters got on my nerves. Jess seemed to be too uptight and Sari's actions didn't always make sense to me. It was not a bad book, it just didn't live up to the reviews I'd read about it."
3,Lackluster,"I bought this book expecting, from the front flap and other reviews that I'd heard, to read a spectacular heart moving, coming-of-age tale. I was flatly turned down. This book is far too cliched and uninteresting to read. At first glance, Jess is the perfect heroine, but as we get further into the book, to me, she seemed weak, not a very good character at all. Sari is unendingly obnoxious, a trait that Fredericks portrays very well, but her redemption is hurried and unbelievable. I did not appreciate this book. The plot had potential, but the writing style and characters were lackluster. If you want to read truly brilliant books of the same genre, I suggest ""Sloppy Firsts"" and ""Second Helpings"" as well as the well-known ""The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants""."
3,The True Meaning of Cleavage,"This book wasn't all that bad. It just bothers me how the title has nothing to do with the book, at least not much. I have always hated books like that, and I think the author could have come up with something more creative that actually matched the book.Overall, not bad. Not the best, either, but good. Jess is an outcast, and when her best friend goes out with the popular senior David Cole she gets confused, angry, and feels abandoned."
4,Tony Rice plays Gordon Lightfoot and Everyone is Happy,"Tony moves away from the bluegrass sound on this album and the results are very satisfying. His versions of ""Shadows"" and ""Bitter Green"" are classics. The material is strong (all Gordon Lightfoot covers) and the singing and guitar-playing is vintage Tony Rice. If you want an introduction to Tony Rice's non-bluegrass material, you can't go wrong with this one..."
5,Virtuoso...,"A friend of mine turned me on to Tony Rice with this CD. Before then, I didnt really consider myself a bluegrass fan (or a Gordon Lightfoot fan either) - just a fan of great guitar playing. Needless to say, I was blown away - proved to me to always try and keep an open mind to new things. Rice is a virtuoso - these songs are filled with extremely expressive and creative playing...fluid yet restrained, you can tell he could really let it rip if he wanted, but the fact that he holds back and finds just the right notes is somehow even more impressive. Lightfoot's naturally eloquent and simple lyrics provide a great framework for Rice's unique interpretations, while acknowledging the author's inspiration in the album title. Favorites include: ""Go My Way"", ""Bitter Green,"" ""Early Morning Rain,"" ""Sixteen Miles,"" and ""Whisper My Name."" Don't let the benign title fool you, this is a great CD by an excellent musician."
5,Rice on Lightfoot.....Mighty Fine !!,"Great sounds, excellent guitar work and musicians....plus you get 17 songs !! geat music from old masters."
4,Nice Discovery,"I had heard of Tony Rice but had never listened to any of his albums until I purchased this CD. I bought it, as you might guess, because of the Gordon Lightfoot songs. I'm a huge Lightfoot fan and wanted to hear these bluegrass interpretations of his songs. And I have to say that I'm quite impressed. Obviously the musicianship here is stellar, and Rice's vocals are good too. I like the fact that Rice chose a wide assortment of Lightfoot's songs, not just the obvious hits or things you can find on ""Best Of"" compilations. This is a nice discovery that I think I'll end up loving."
4,Outstanding Journey,"Pudgy, self-conscious, 16 yr. old Jenna Boller is not thrilled at the prospect of driving old Mrs. Gladstone from Chicago to Texas in her enormous white Cadillac. She is perfectly content with selling shoes in one of the many stores in the Gladstone chain. However, when Jenna's alcoholic father comes to town Jenna decides that perhaps a trip to the stockholder's meeting, with an opportunity to shoe-store spy along the way, isn't such a bad idea. Both women, committed to quality, high standards, and not allowing Gladstone's to become a shoddy enterprise, learn that their similarities far outweigh their differences. This is a heartwarming and funny tale of mutual respect across generations."
4,"Reviewer from Campton, Kentucky","I'm am not a big reader,but being a high school student, that's something you have to do. Our History teacher gave us an assignment to pick our own kind of book and right a report on it. Dread immediatly came. But as soon as I started reading Rules Of The Road I couldn't put it down. It was funny, serios, educational, and heartbreaking all at once. I could really connect with the main character. We both came from a broken home for the same reason and we both are new drivers. I knew exactly how she felt and that made the book a lot more interesting. This is the first book by Joan Bauer that I have read, but I can't wait to read Sticks and Thwonk!"
5,wow,"This book was great! I don't know why other reviewers have been saying it talks about the history of shoes and whatnot, because it doesn't. This is the story of a girl and her trip with the owner of s shoe company who want to keep it from falling into the wrong hands.This is a great book, its funny, its shocking, and its fun to read. Its one of my favorites."
3,EHhhhHh....Thought it'd be better,"This book is about how this girl Jenna is experiencing famiily problems-her dad being an alcoholic and her grandma dying, her mom needing her...but she wants to get away from this when she's offered to drive the owner of Gladstone's shoe company to Texas to fight her son's view on how to run Gladstones. 1st of all I didn't like the ending much, and when i finished the last page I wasn't like WOW, this book was great. I wouldn't recommend it ever, but its not terrible, its got thought put into writing it. Some parts are funny, very dramatic too."
5,Rules of the Road,Rules of the road is a story about a teen that works at Gladstones selling shoes. Suddenly the owner of the store wants her to drive her to all the stores and to Texas to get ready for her retirement. Jenna learns alot and learns to face her fears. The story talks about Jenna's personal life with her dads drinking and her grandmas alzhimers. The story follows them as they go to all the different gladstone stores. Will Jenna learn to face her biggest fear? You are going to have to read the story to find.I give this book five stars.
3,GOOD FUN FILLED BOOK!!,This is a really good book. They travel from Illinois to Texas. They had lots of exciting adventures along the way. They had the best time. This book is full of laughs and will definately keep you reading. I really liked this book. I would definately read it again.
4,Joan Bauer knows more than just the rules of the road,"Joan Bauer's best book. It is intelligent, witty, and touching. It is a book that I would recommend to the middle reader all the way up to the adult reader. It is not just for young-adults at all. If you only read one book this year, I would suggest that you read this one. Of course, hopefully, you will read more than one book. If you are looking for smart, funny characters and dialogue, this is the definite choice for you. The comedy, however, is also covered a little by the serious plot of the story."
4,Rules of the Road,Rules of the Road by Joan Bauer was a great book. I highly recommend it. At first I didn't think I would like the book that much. It seemed boring. Once I got to the middle of the book though I liked it a lot. I got to learn about some of Jenna's personal problems. Jenna's dad is a drunk and her grandmother has Alzheimer's disease. The book was very good and I hope you get a chance to read it.
4,Rules of The Road,"I liked this book because I can relate to it. I can relate to it because in the book one of the main character's close friends dies. One of my close relatives died and I handled it the way that the main character did. The author told the story as if she were a third person watching it. This book has great detail. The author explains what she is talking about so that you can make a mental image in your head. I recommend you read this book because it was a great book and it had a lot of realistic issues in it. I rate this book 4 stars because at the end of a chapter the author would leave you wondering about what was going to happen next (suspense). In the end, this book turns out to be great!"
3,This is a book worth reading,This book is not like any other. It shows the life of a high school girl that is not like the other kids. She has an out of the ordinary family with a dad that has a drinking problem and a mom that works overtime. She escapes all the madness by driving all around the country for a whole summer. I liked this book because it showed the real life of a teenager and how an out of the ordinary person can make extraodinary differences. I would defintly recommend this book to a friend.
4,Rules of the Road,"This book is about a girl named Jenna Boller,who is having many problems in her young life.Jenna's dad is a drunk and will not leave her alone for 2 seconds.Jenna works at a shoe store,that her dad frequently comes to,to bother her.Then Jenna gets fed up with her dad and goes on a trip to Texas with her boss.While on the trip, Jenna experiences many things that will change her life.I give this book 4 stars ,and I highly recommend this book if you like humorous and suspenseful books."
3,Succeed With Your Problems,Rules of the Road is a great book if you're into reading about someone with a lot of problems just trying to succeed in life. Her main problems are her father's heavy drinking problems and her grandmother's Alzheimer's. She works at a shoestore. She finally gets to get away from her problems when she is hired to be Mrs. Gladstone's driver and assistant. Mrs. Gladstone is going to Texas to announce her retirement. Jenna meets people like Alice Lovett and Harry Bender. Harry is considered the best shoesalesman in the world. Jenna considers him like a father. On the trip she learns a lot about life. When they have the stockholders' meeting Mrs. Gladstone would not retire because she did not want Elden to do what he planned to do. She was afraid of who Elden would sell it to.
4,---> Rules of Life <---,"Jenna is a girl that hasn't experienced lifes treasures. Although, she works at an awesome shoe shop, and she is awesome at picking the right shoes, for people. She adjusts to every type, and age of crowds. But, Jenna also has a missing side of her, as her father is a drunk, and is now seperated from her mother. Jenna lives with her mother, and her sister also. Anyways, the owner of the shop, and all other shops with that name, has to stand up to her son, and not retire. So Jenna goes on a unforgetable road trip.---I cut one star off, because of the disturbing talk about her father. But, I guess in some ways it does fill up the book with more jazz.---I do reccomend this book!"
2,OVER RATED!,I recieved this book as a present. I usually enjoy most every book I read. This was a great disapointment. I cannot believe how many people like this book. It was boring and didn't have an ending. The characters were stiff and impersonal.
2,Clinton @ Richview Middle School @ Clks. Tenn.,"The book starts off in a shoe store, where Jenne Boller is working. She is a tall girl and she can sell anything to almost anybody. She is also facing family problems. To add on to that her dad is an alcoholic he even interrups her at her work. Sometimes it gets so bad she wants to leave town. So one day Madiline Gladstone,owner of a shoe company,hires her to be a driver. She takes a long journey across the U.S.. Then she meets the great Harry Blender And he teaches her the rules of the road. This Book was very interesting because of the lesson taught in it. It shows you that anybody can do anything."
4,Rules of the Road,"Rules of the Road gives young kids a chance to feel like they have made a huge accomplishment themselves. Jenna brings understanding and friendship to the book, while Ms.Gladstone brings the book a problem and a witty sense of humor. Read this book to your kids and it would make a great gift for your 16 year old teen who is ready to get behind the wheel."
4,Rules of the Road,"RULES OF THE ROAD is about a girl named Jenna that works at a shoe store called Gladstone's. She accepts when the manager of the chain of Gladstone stores offers to pay her to drive her across the country for a series of meetings for the store. While driving, Jenna finds out about the store's history and its future- including the disturbing news that Gladstone's is about to be sold to a larger company. Jenna fights against the sale, with the manager's help. They stick together even when the manager's own son, Elden, admits that he is the person that wanted to sell Gladstone's in the first place! All in all, this is an inspirational story, and changed the way I look at life!A very good read, I highly recommend it!"
1,FULL OF MISTAKES,"I just want to know one thing; where in the world did this guy get his information?!If you like to look at pictures, then this book is mediocre...barely. This book is full of technical errors suggesting that there are 454 camaros and misidentifying a lot of the cars pictured, just for a couple examples.Not a good book at all."
2,"Nice pictures, but...","I just received this book today. It is full of mistakes and misinformation. And I've only begun to read it! So far, I've just read a few paragraphs and all the photo captions. I really like the color photos. But I won't rely on any of the technical information. The Camaro history may be correct. I haven't read it, yet. I don't consider this book a good buy."
5,Makes abstract concepts easy to understand,"My 13-year-old son, who has mild autism, just LOVES this book. With his difficulties in understanding the relatively abstract concepts involved in learning religion, it's been a little tough keeping him interested in learning this kind of material. This book, however, is very appealing to him, and he and I have read it together many, many times. This book is beautifully illustrated. The explanations of the commandments are in relatively simple language that he can easily understand, appreciate, and apply to his own life. A real winner!"
5,It Is Cool,It has a multitude of great! games i like it a lot the compatability with PS1 is good i play FF tactics on it
4,just a suggestion,"for the mom who said her son's PS2 was driving her crazy-- two suggestions. buy a wireless (or even a wired) headset for the TV he's playing it on (hello!?! the sound comes from the tv not the box!!), or get him to either turn down the volume or hit the mute button. good grief... just thoughts.as for the game-- every gaming geek i know who has a PS2 just loves it. I used to sit mind numbingly bored while the guys played and loved it. I have several friends who just rave about the good games, and all that...just thought i'd share."
4,amazing,well its an amazing system to play if your an old school gamer however it takes why to long to get here
4,i like playing this,"it's funner than my other game systems, but not an up to date one. I personally prefer the older generation systems, but I am only able to find a few REALLY good games. The rest of them are fine, but if you can afford something better, go for it."
4,PS2 a must have system for all ages,"The ps2 can play dvds and maybe cds, but it's hard because you have to use two hands for a controller, so if I were you I would get a remote. You can get hundreds of games for you ps2 at a great price between 20 and 30 dollars. The only real problem is that the power switch is at the back, the fan is very quiet and it feels like it doesn't pollute. So, if your looking for a system with a great price and great games with lots of fun then get the ps2."
5,Great gaming system and DVD player!,"I have had this PS2 for over four years and have never ever had any problem with it. It still plays games perfectly and plays DVDs perfectly as well. The loading time is a bit slow, but for this price, I can't even complain much about that. Even though there are more sophisticated gaming systems with better graphics, you can't go wrong with the Ps2.Highly recommended!"
4,A great system but not the best.,"For my entire life i have been playing games and nevr been strictly nintendo or sony or any company. I have all three of the new systems (PS2,Gamecube,and XBOX) and i believe that the PS2 has many advantages, it also has many disadvantages. The PS2 has the most games, but none of them compare to Halo, Ninja Gaiden, or Star Wars: KOTR. Also, the PS2 has been out for a year or more longer than the xbox or gamecube. The PS2 does not have anything close to the xbox in terms of graphics. To even match what the xbox has, you would need to spend 100s of dollars more. Still, the PS2 still has some amazing games now, and coming soon. (PS2 exclusives as of 4-30-04):-SOCOM 1+2-Jak 1-3-Metal Gear Solid 3-Gran Turismo-Ratchet and Clank 1-3-God of War-and the Final Fantasy series"
1,sony lies,I THINK SONY IS A [...] BECAUSE WHEN PEOPLE BUY THIS SESTEM IN THE WARRINTEE ONLY LAST ABOUT A YEAR OR TWO THEN THERE ARE A BUNCH OF PROBLEMS AND PEOPLE HAVE TO TAKE IT TO GET FIXED LIKE ME I BOUGHT THIS TWO YEARS LATER IT BROKE I HAVE NOT PLAYED IT FOR A MONTH NOW I THINK SONY SHOULD TELL PEOPLE ABOUT THE PS2.
1,Problems with playstation 2,"Beware - Playstation two has an ongoing problem with being unable to read discs. We replaced ours within one month of purchase, then Sony repaired it once. When we shipped it off for a second repair, Sony refused to repair it because the warranty sticker was gone. I paid $199 for the playstation console and $70 for shipping it twice - now we have no console."
2,"Console Great Value, But Controller Doesn't Work!","The Console is a great value! I can play all of my PS2 games on it for a great price. The only problem I found is that the controller that was included with it DOES NOT WORK. AT ALL. This is a problem considering it was misrepresented in the item description. One of the reasons why I chose this particular item and not other PS2 consoles is that it included a controller. Satisfied with the console, DISAPPOINTED with the controller."
1,Sorry.,"Sorry, but compared to the XBox the graphics $uck, compared to the GC it's a lot more expensive. Only two controllers. Memory cards not cheap.What's this you say? Lots of games? Bah! The games suck!! Well, Final Fantasy is really good, but not many people like RPGs. Halo and Metroid Prime beat the socks off of anything it has."
2,Outdated and Outpowered,"The Playstation2 is running on technology that was developed back in 1999. In addition, the margin of quality games between the Xbox and PS2 are shrinking at a rapid rate. The Grand Theft Auto sereis was just porte over to the Xbox, with beefed up grpahics and other features. If you are looking to purchase a console this year for Christmas, the Xbox would be the best bet. heck, even the online play is incredible (a broadband only service)The Xbox has truly proven itself and made a spot among the other console contenders."
2,Video games are for people with spare time ...,"No video game system will ever be as profound as the Super Nintendo. Those of you who feel that the PS1 is the most important video game system of our time are probably the same people waiting in line for 48 hours for the new systems. Get a life. Seriously. Notice that Sony and Microsoft are companies that have experienced problems in other realms (e.g., Sony's PS3 and laptop batteries, everything Microsoft touches). Nintendo is the only real video game company left on Earth. And it is also the only company that is willing to accept the fact that video games are not, and should not be, a major part of human life - thus the reasonable prices for the Wii. Anyone who can pay $500 - $600 for a console should become philanthropists."
1,Terrible,"I thought I could use a less harsh word to describe the Sony PS2, but then I realized that there is no better word. Don't waste your money on this. I bought it and it has put me through so much anger and dissapointment that I had to tell other people so they don't suffer the same fate. Buy an X-box. They are SO much better than this piece of useless rubbish. It's a lame excuse for a console. And when PS3 comes out, we X-box owners WILL NOT be crying, we will be laughing at all the gits who wasted their money on PS3."
3,dissipointing,this system is very dissiopointing my cousin owns one and i own an xbox xbox has much better graphics
1,ps2,"i bought a controller,av cables,and the the console door would not open without help.when i inserted a brand new game it would not play."
1,wii and ps2,"We have both a Wii and a PS2. They are both pretty fun. But PS2 has more problems like what Wii doesnt.BADS ABOUT WIInot great controllernot a lot of older gamesGOODS ABOUT WIIbetter gameplaybetter graphicsbetter soundBADS ABOUT PS2has problems reading games and dvds, wii dosen'tgameplay sometimes sucks, freezesworse graphicspop ins and slowdownsGOODS ABOUT PS2has a lot of great gamesbest controllersportable perhaps"
1,Disapointed,I am not able to give a good review at this time as I never recived the sonny play station 2 I had order back in Nov.
4,System Match up,"First off let me start of by saying I have pretty much everything including an atari, so I know a thing or two about games. Pthe playstation2 2 has its good points and its bad points just like the other two systems out there. For some games the system can really push the envelope of its processing power, but on some games like sonic heroes you can see a definite difference between the systems. I was a hardcore playstation loyalist till I got my xbox. Now i belive that all three systems are marketed to a certain audience. The cube is for kids till about 13. The playstation is for people about 13-20 and the older enthusiats like me. The xbox as far as I am concerned is for more advanced gamers. so in conclusion the playstation is a great buy as long as you dont get an older unit. (lol)"
1,Sony Playstation 2 Game Console,"When you play the color games on the console, they appear in black & white not color which is very disturbing and annoying."
5,a great thing,"I have played one and it is great, the most best games are Lord of the rings the two towers, lord of the rings the return of the king,and star wars battlefront."
2,gamecube is better.,ok i've tried this but the load time is rediculous!!! it takes a very very long time to load then the graphics are choppy.just rediculous.
2,xbox way better,playstation 2 really blows. its got a controller fit for a 3 year old. the graphics on ps2 are awful. as ps2 is the weakest system currently avilabale. the system freeken freezes up aqll the time. every time i put a game inside it it frrezes. so i have to shut the system off and start all over again 1000 times. and beleive me if you get a ps2 there is no way not to expereince all that constant frrezing. the only good games ps2 has are jak 2 and metal gear solid sons of liberty. xbox has halo panser dragon orta tom clancys slinter cell rainbow six 3 soul calibur 2 project gotham racing and so on. ps2 breaks down a lot. ps2 is far to weak to satisfy anybodys playing needs. ...
3,Game system is not what expected,The game system was in packaging as promised but is missing part of the player one controller port making it very difficult to insert controllers without bending the metal parts inside. I have had to repair it twice already and only had it for a couple weeks.
3,UNBIASED REVIEWED,"PS2 was a great system but now is paling to the other systems, Each system have there big tradmark games,XBOX-HaloGamcube- Mario,Metroid, resident evilPs2- THEy SOLD GTA SAN ANDREAS TO XBOXnow everyone wants Gta and Halo but now you get GTA and Halo on xbox so why buy Ps2plus you need your adventrue games and stuff on GamecubeBottome Line- If you want the best games go for Xbox and Gamecube,You can get any ps2 game for xbox,If you can only get one and you can play M rated games go 4 Xbox and try hard for Gamecube but Ps2 is gone"
3,It's Over rated,"PS2 is a great system like many people say but its not that good. The graphics are about as good as they are ever going to get on the system and the extensive library is alright but most of the games suck or are just plain retarded. If you are a serious gamer you should go with an Xbox because of its unbeatable power. Who cares if it takes up half a sqare inch more than the Ps2? If you are a person who has had N64, NES, SNES, Or gameboy in the past then you should get a gamecube. PS2's are okay if you don't play that much but it only has a handful of GOOD games whereas Microsoft and Nintendo Are spiting out Masterpiece after Masterpiece. What ever system you get don't go saying ""Oh Xbox and Gamecube SUCK"" or ""My Xbox kicks your little pansy PS2's ASS!!"" It's just lame.So it all comes down to PS2=Casual Gamer/ Xbox=Serious gamer/ Gamecube=Nintendo Fans. And Your a MORON If you think otherwise."
3,"Good, but could be better","I have had the ps2 for 4 years now. I think the system is OK but nothing really jumps out at me that's special about it. Their are almost no exclusive games. The graphics are alright but not as good as the xbox which has the best graphics, even though graphics don't matter as long as you can play the game and have fun. Sony just didn't put anything original to the ps2 and it may have the most games, but in the end, they are almost all the same concept: Shooting and killing, sports, or porn."
4,Review Of PlayStation 2,"I think that the console is really good.I Just purchased Grand Theft Auto San Andreas but the playstaion isn't fast enough to load the graphics in the game when playing,i got my cosole in 2002.The ground starts to turn silver and i can't see anything.I aslso think its noisy unless you have the newer version of this console.Otherwise the system is pretty good.Especially when you have Grand Theft Auto San Andreas.I just hope Sony fixes this problem."
2,Boring,About a month ago I wrote a review about how Playstation 2 is a great system. I down graded from Gamecube to Xbox then even more downgraded when I went to Xbox to PS2. I liked it at first and after a month I realized nothings great for this system. I mean no games are good and when a game comes out for all three systems it comes out better on the Gamecube even the Xbox which has no great setup in gameplay. The system is suppose to have the new internal chip which fixes the problems of the old style PS2. The system freezes and stops loading all the time and these are all new games. The console really sucks after I really get use to it. The reason I gave it a 2 star rating is because it has better wrestling games then any other system. No after buying this and playing it I realized anyone who says it's better then the other two consoles is a complete loser who needs to grow up big time. Trust me get a Gamecube or Xbox either one is better.
5,Killer game machine.,"I was lucky enough to have a Game Cube and a PS2.So different, so awesome, both of them.My PS2......Awesome graphics, game play and a perfect controller also.Granted, the system is only as good as the games for it...Metal Gear.Devil May Cry.Gran Turismo.There are endless games for endless gamers on this system.And it plays regular movies too.I still haven't upgraded to a PS3.....yet.I'm still happy with this one.If you play games, then you have to own a PS2, period.Highest recommendations."
5,Sony's video gaming console: the Playstation 2,"The Playstation 2's Specs._____Pros_____Clear graphicsCan play all psone, ps2 games, dvds, and cdsNo need to purchase a remote to play dvdsLots and Lots of gamesGood online serviceMost popular systemGoing to have a 40 gig. hard drive_____Cons_____Not the most powerful system out thereOnly 2 controller portsThe Playstation 2 is the best there is. Now I'm saying that the other 2 systems are bad its just that I prefer the Ps2. The Xbox is the big dog in graphics and system power. The Gamecube is the best multiplayer system out there. It has a lot of kid friendly games. I got the Ps2 because of the games. I purchase systems because of the games not the system itself. But you make your choice. Thankyou and I hope I have helped.ps: I don't like the idea of Xbox Live, paying fifty dollars for a starter kit, then fifty dollars for a sign up fee and a six dollar monthly fee. I don't want to pay that much, no way."
3,PS2 vs. Xbox vs. Gamecube,PS2Pros- Most games- DVD playable out of the box- layed flat or standing- online gamingCons- Graphics- controller {I don't like the quality or comfort.}GamecubePros- Nintendo exclusives- family systemCons- No online- No DVD- Few mature gamesXboxPros- Graphics are the best- Controller {two main contrllers the duke is my fav.}- Xbox Live is the best online service- Halo and other exclusivesCons- No DVD out of box- Price is high
1,PS2 SUCKS!,"If you like slow loads, 2 controller slots, and a system that ALWAYS gets disc read errors PS2 Is for you! I have GC X-Box And Ps2...X-box blows em all away. GC is good but it has mostly kiddy games. PS2 has good games, but its a piece of S#!T. Honestly..How many of you who have it have had to get either a new one or get it repaired? Thanks for Listening, Jim"
3,Look on the bright side!,If you take the ps2s problems and turn them around they are really not that bad. For example the ps2 only has 2 controler slotes so you only have to buy 2 controlers.Sony Playstation 2 Dualshock Controller Black
5,console don't mean a thing,"everyone is saying xbox has better graphics than ps2, thats bull crap. the brand of console you use does'nt matter, the games are what matter. it all depends on the makers of the games and how well they make them, all games appear the same on both xbox and ps2."
2,Buy the system as a DVD player only,"The PS2 has inferoir graphics to GameCube and Xbox. Its graphics chip runs at only 150 Mhz. Gamecube; 205 Mhz and Xbox is a whopping 780 Mhz. Plus you have to search for buttons on the controller, which kinda stinks. Spend your money on a Gamecube. Nuff said"
1,PS2 STINKS!! I give it 0 stars!,"PS2 sucks! I'm warning you! Don't waste your money on a stupid console like this! I have to give at least 1 star because that is the minamim. If there was no minimen I would give it 0 stars. Well PS2 does have alot of games, but there too childish and boring. Also my friends got a PS2 and it only lasted for one day!Well if you don't want to waste your money get an XBOX!!"
1,Confusing,"The games are good,but the freakin controller are confusing. The camera is also horrible. Look, you have 2 joysticks (I have no clue which one controls the character) and billion's of other buttons. I made me sooooo mad I stopped playing and threw it out of the window and threw it to the garbage. Then I picked It up and then hit it with a hammer and threw it out to the road. Then at last, a car smashed it. Shadow the hedgehog, Do Your Chaos Blast 1,000,000 times. HaHaHaHaHa.Bye PS2. I also have a gamecube. There are great games out there.Overall:GET A GAMECUBE INSTEAD OF A USLESS PIECE OF CRAP: PS2"
2,PS2=???,"So I just bought a ps2. I borrowed a game from my friend, (he doesn't take care of his games), and it was a little scrathed. It could barrely load the game!!! It said disk read error 5 times, then I got it to work! I have a gamecube and one of my games is almost totally scrathed up and it could play the game just fine. Once in a while I had to clean it, but it still ran 85% of the time the game ran. I would say get a Gamecube, or an Xbox, or Xbox 360. One more thing I don't like is how you can only have 2 player! Gamecube has 4 player, Xbox has 4 player! Second is IT PRETTY MUCH SUCKS! THE END.Thanks for listening. Dakky"
2,wahhhh!!!!,SAN ANDREAS IS ALSO COMEING ON XBOX WHICH I OWN I MEAN PS2 IS GOOD PS2 IS GOOD BUT NOT BETTER THEN XBOX I PLAYED PS2 AT MY COUSIN's HOUSE GAMECUBE BEATS PS2 X STANDS FOR POWER AND GREEN STANDS FOR DARTH VADER SO GET XBOX OR GAMECUBE AND PLUS XBOX HAS AN HARD DISK SO NO MORE MEMOREY CARDS
2,Not really good system,Ok my friend has a PS2 and Gamecube he has 5 games for gamecube and 15 for ps2 the graphics for ps2 sucks the games suck Xbox and GC has ps2 games and Grand thief auto is weird the only game good is UNREAL for ps2 but has read disk error and it overheats every 2 hours his psone broke for being played more than 2 hours really sad and it takes forever to plug it up gamecube is more fun and better than PS2 WARNING if PS2 is played more than 2 hours it will overheat. Dvd for ps2 sucked it freezes.
2,OMG LOL LOL LOL Stupid PS2,PS2 cannot play DOOM 3 HALF LIFE 2 EVEN HALO cause its graphics are too weak XBOX and even gamecube sorry not for gamecube can play those games without problem! DOnt worry PS3 is comming up WAIT the graphics are worse than XBOX! and is crappy as ps2 PS2 only has 2 controller ports laggy online and crapp games and weak memory and no fan so it will overheat PS2 is too weak Thats one of the reasons it does not have halo!
2,I love my PS2 but hate the disc read errors,"The people that don't have disc read errors are lucky, lucky people. Some of my favorite games cannot be played because of the faulty system. I love my PS2 and we love playing games but I cannot forgive them for what is clearly a mechanical issue that should have resulted in a recall. Is that why they are coming out with this new model? So that all of us will go buy it hoping it will solve our disc read errors? I say we boycott!They will ultimately lose me as a customer when the next round of game systems come out and many of us will jump ship. I can't wait until that day because I don't want to by yet another PS2 or wait weeks on end, pay my own shipping, etc. so that they can fix something that is their fault to begin with.Shame on you Sony!"
4,great system BUY,"PS2 is a great system. ITs reliable, great selection of games, great DVD player, and good enuf for me graphics. I wuld make this review longer at a 35 year old sophisticated man level, but im tired its 4:00 a.m. right now.Two Words- Buy it- if ur in to game selections this is the place to goOne more thing. I have a gamecube and i am 14. Well, im not young and i enjoy the thing more that PS2 excluding the fact that PS2 is a great system. well wat im trying to get at is that GameCube is not based for a younger set. havent you noticed that almost all the games on PS2 and XBox are also on GAMECUBE!!!!!!!! wow that one shocked YOU DIDNT IT!"
1,Utter garbage,"Thanks for knocking the ever so creative Sega Dreamcast out of the water, Sony. You could have at least given us something good and not a clunky black box with DVD playback. You could have at least offered an online service like Xbox. You could have at least produced an outstanding library like on Gamecube. But no. You just have to scare Dreamcast away, crush Gamecube, and fight with Xbox. I have no idea how you do that with such an ugly mess that groans and never works. I hate you Sony."
5,Works grate,thanks for the consle works grate thanks plays all my games with no problems can't wate to bey more item's from Amazon
1,Beware Disk Error Problem,"The PS2 has a known problem reading game discs with blue backs. With a known defect, they failed to do a recall. Getting them to replace the PS2 is difficult although some have succeeded where they spent a lot of time on the phone. For those who bought into the PS2 system, there is a big switching costs in that you have all these games that will not play on other systems (and some of which will not play on the PS2). If you are starting anew, seriously consider a different company that stands behind its products better."
4,Freedom of Speech,"This goes out to ""Person Who Likes Good Stuff""I don't know what you mean that the PS2 doesn't have original games. I mean Resident Evil started from PS, Devil May Cry, Gran Turismo, etc. I can go on.THIS SECTION GOES OUT TO EVERYONE.I've never had a problem with my PS2 because I don't keep it lying around in areas it shouldn't be in, like most people do with theirs. Thats why your PS2's keep breaking because you people can't take of it properly. Clean it up every now and then and keep it somwhere where it's not going to get beat up on.I still have my first one that I bought and it's in excellent condition. I haven't had problems with at all since I've had it because I know how to take care of it unlike most people."
4,Better than the Xbox,"Comparing the Xbox and the PS2, PS2 has the graphics and a good amount of good, worth your time, games. Such titles such as the Ace Combat and Final Fantasy series make it a good balance between performance and games, but it only has two controller slots and you have to BUY the multi-tap adapter for four controllers(I think that was a wrong move by Sony).There aren't that many multiplayer games that are fun enough to give your opponent that ""IN YOUR FACE"" attitude. There are still not enough games to appeal to people with different interests. Most of the Playstation-only games are quite the same. Some concerns are that there have been complaints that the wires may fray and can be a danger, and the CD tray might freeze or get jammed. If you treat your PS2 carefully, you shouldn't have a problem. At least it can play DVDs. The Xbox--avg customer rating = 4 starsThe PS2---------avg customer rating = 4 starsThe Gamecube---avg customer rating = 4 and a half stars."
4,wwf smakdown 2 know your role,excellent gameplay not so good graphics can create old school taker brock lesnar and other present wrestlers excellent game for ps1
2,......I hate this #@@#!#@ thing......,"First of all, this system sucks all the way in. The only thing that is good is that there are lots of games to choose from. The thing that sucks is that there are only two controller ports and the accesories are expensive."
3,"Average, nothing too special","Everyone is always saying PS2 is the best system out there, so I'm going to start with the downside of buying a PS2. First, after you buy one, they come out with a smaller edition. Second, the controllers are a bit flimsy. Third, buying a memory card. I found that the Xbox's onboard memory is alot better, as I can store millions of games and online downloads. Fourth, the graphics are a bit out of date on PS2. The gamecube has worst, don't get me wrong, but the PS2 doesn't have anything special.Now, the good side of getting this system is that you don't have to buy a special remote to play the DVDs, there are millions of games to suit all gamers, the controllers have a nice button configuration, and it still has better graphics than the newer Gamecube.Before you buy this system, ask yourself if any of the games look appealing, what you'll be using it for the most (because the DVD player can break really easily)."
5,BUY IT NOW,"This system is a definate most have item. The best games are for this system. This can play the games, DVDs, and CDs. This much better than gamecube and Xbox."
1,Will never buy one again!,"Ok so my wife and I bought a PS2 for our son for christmas 2 years ago and when we first plugged it in and started using it, it worked fine for about an hour and then the picture started flickering and the sound got distorted. so we took it back to the store and exchanged it for another one and it worked fine for about 3 and a half months and then again the picture would start flickering off and on and the sound would go out and get distorted while playing it, so we tried to return it and get our money beack but because it was out of warrentee we couldnt. SO we wound up sending it in to get fixed and it cost us 158.99 to fix a connection in the back where the wires plug into because it had to be replaced. SO we got it back and one month later it started doing the samething again and because there was no repair warrentee we wound up throwing out the PS2 and getting an Xbox. By the way the Xbox has great games and has never broke down."
1,"Over rated, Over hyped, Mindwashed Fanbase","All right, I have owned one of these abominations. I owned it for five days before I cast it out of my life. It is by far one of the worst game systems on the market. The graphics are terrible, there were more interesting games for the Sega Saturn, and the fact that so many people want this over rated junk is beyond my understanding. The DVD player is sub par. The control design is ripped off of old Gravis Game pads for the PC with two very annoyingly placed analog sticks. What we have here is possibly the worst console ever created. Worse then the N-gage, worse then the Atari Jaguar, worse then even, dare I say it, the CD-I. No offence to people who liked those systems of course. But seriously people. Buy a computer or a real game system instead of this trash. Even the Xbox has a better DVD player and Panzer Dragoon Orta. For the rest of the story, I returned the PS2 for a Gamecube, and with that, I've been very happy."
2,Disc read error after some time...,The PS2 is designed to have disc read error after warranty expiration. It will just break down for no obvious reason. There is a class action lawsuit against Sony because so many people have complained about this problem.
4,sony playstation 2,"Good Points:It has a dvd playerBetter graphics by farThe ps1 Sucked so the Ps2 absolutely thrashes itgood styleBad Points:It makes an extremely loud noiseGeneral Comments:The Sony Playstation 2 is definitly worth buying, but soon the PS3 is coming out, so I'll be looking forward to that, I think there isn't much wrong with the PS2, the graphics and gaming are absouletly fabulous!(...)"
2,not too good,ok im totally into games i have game cube and stuff too. but this has no game for girls they are either too girly of too sporty. ive only found 4 games that i like and i have rented 28. the game cube is much better. the graphacics arent too good either and its really loud when its on.and if your getting the screen for the car you need to buy a generator to put in the car for it too work and a cheep one of those is $50. it much more worth it to buy a gamecuse they have donkeykong and mario i was so mad when i got this i thought ok ill be able to play some good games then i realized that all of the games i wanted were only on gamecube.
1,LYING WORTHLESS P.O.S.,"PS2 came in below expected quality, freezes often for no apparent reason, and both controllers have buttons that do not work. This item is beyond ""used"" in the normal wear-and-tear sense. THOROUGHLY DISSAPOINTED. DO NOT TRUST."
1,wouldn`t touch it with a 10 foot pole,"When I asked the guy at my computer shop about PS2 he said he wouldn`t touch it with a 10 foot pole, so either get X BOX or get an 11 foot pole hahahaha"
2,screw gamecube forget playstation 2 xbox rules,playstation 2 sucks. it has the worst graphics controls etc. it has no online capababilities and its games blow as-. plaqystation 2 has bunches of childish games. xbox is the best it has the best graphics the best controls lots of excellent games a built in cd player and more. playstation 2 is weak boring and not all that fun to play. gamecube is worse but if you really want the best get an xbox.
4,PS2 IS THE SUPREME RULER OF ALL SYSTEMZ!,"OK, FIRST OF ALL I LIKE CAPS LOCK, DEAL W/ IT! OK, PS2 IS BY FAR THE BEST, HAS THE BEST CONTROLLER, AND BEST GAMES. DESPITE COMMON BELIEFE, ALL THE SYSTEMS HAVE THE EXACT SAME GRAPHICS, 128 BIT. ITS THE GAME MANAFACTUER THAT MESSES UP GRAPHICS, NOT THE PS2. LIKE, FOR EXAMPLE, GAMES LIKE THE RATCHET & CLANK SERIES HAVE THE BEST GRAPHICS OUT OF ALL THE GAMES, AND ARE MADE BY INSOMNIAC GAMES. OTHERS, LIKE ACE COMBAT 04 AND TAK AND THE POWER OF JUJU (POSSIBLY THE DUMBEST GAME IN THE UNIVERSE) HAVE S****Y GRAPHICS. AND XBOX, HALO HAS BAD GRAPHICS, SO DOES DYANSTY WARRIORS 4, BUT EVERYONE LIKES IT. AND GAMECUBE, LETS JUST PUT IT THIS WAY: GAMECUBE IS A JOKE. I REALLY HOPE THAT MY REVIEW WILL STEER U IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION WHEN BUYING A NEW SYSTEM. OH YEAH, P.S: PS2 ALSO HAS THE WIDEST SELECTION OF GAMES."
3,alright but not the best,"This system is alright I have played it at my friend's house and I have to admit, some of the games are AWESOME but for most of the games they are nothin special. I own a cube and personally I think it beats the crap out of PS2 and Xbox well I wont even go there its so bad. All in all its not bad but I would Definitely buy a Gamecube first."
2,here ps2 went wrong,i give ps2 4 stars because it has a tendicy of messing up after a couple of years. my ps2 dont play any blue bottom discs and ps1 discs neither. sometimes my dvds dont work. most of my friends blue disc dont work. the loading time on it can take very long. it has good games but alot flaws to come with it. its not that the price is a issue its just that if you make something expensive al least make sure everything is fine
2,wow,"So I bought the ps2, and waited nearly 10 days. I open it up and there is a ps2, but no power cords, no tv cords, no nothing. so basically I was sent a 50 dollar decoration for my shelf :I"
2,Disc Read Error,"Very disapointed with the PS2, disc read error after only a short time of play. Now none of the games work on it. After doing some research, I noticed that this must be a common problem because there are so many people selling cd-rom's for disc read error and other malfunctions associated with the PS2.I would consider investing in another game system if I did not have to buy all new games to go with it."
4,Not only a Playststion 2,The Playstation2 is awesome. You can play Playstaion 1 games on it and watch DVDs too. It has better games on it. You can buy covers for it. I love it. All my cousins have a Playstation 2 now and now we borrow games from each other now.
3,Excellent items for the family.,Playstation 2 was as seen. It was perfect for the family to get some family night gaming in.
5,i live in qatar,"Hi,my name is Rana , i live in Qatar ( Gulf arabian ) and want do know abut playstation2 all anything i want to buy some games my country has this games ."
2,it is a looser compared to gamecube,"okay, ps2 is bad, its not very bad, its just BAD. when im playing ps2 at my mates house i think that it has superb graphics, but when its night and im going home and i am turning on my gamecube and im playing zelda or super mario sunshine ,mario kart, f-zero..........im shocked, because gamecubes graphics is just so incredibly much better than ps2s graphics. the latest ps2s games has good graphics, but even the oldest gamecube games has better graphics. just look at super smash bros melee or resi and rogue leader,theyre all fantastic"
4,The Best,"The Sony Ps2 is probably the best one out there, it has the most games, has a lot of extras you can add on if you want to, you can play dvds, has perfect grafics, exalente sound! WHAT MORE CAN I SAY, ITS THE BEST!"
2,read the fine print,"I didn't read what I was buying, so this was the first bad experience I had with Amazon. Not only was it missing the cables, the door wouldn't open and I ended up having to throw the whole thing away. A wasted $20. Live and learn."
1,PS2,Sony the one and only with the products that don't work right- at least this one worked for a while before breaking down. Sony is the one and onlywhen it comes to no factory recalls.
4,a review,first of all i got 2 games but i boght then first and now i have no PS2. i have played the PS2 at my friends house and i think it's just as good as XBOX. Now im just waiting for someone to let me play my games on their system until i get a PS2. but from my friends i would say its pretty fun.
4,playstation 2,I think that the playstation 2 system is great!It has better graphics than any other system on the market.I just love it!
4,I was so excited! :(,"I was so excited to finally get PS2. I would be able to still use all of my old games from PlayStation One and the graphics and games would be a lot better. Well the graphics and games are much better, but the system itself isn't. I still have problems with the system freezing up. Even when I've only been playing for an hour, it still freezes. Plus a friend of mine had his disk drive (where you put your game disks) break only after owning the system for a few months. It's nice that they add a DVD player to it, but it would be nicer to have a game system that worked better. I also own the Nintendo GameCube, that works awesome!"
4,Great system,"The slimline Sony PS2 is a must have. Small, takes up very little space, easy to connect to any TV or monitor you have. Lots of games available now for ~$20, so you won't be bored easily. I give it 4 stars overall instead of5 because the next gen systems with HD is out and available (if you can find one!), but overall, you won't be upset if you purchase this system. You can still get years of use out of this without breaking your wallet!"
4,Solid system,"The PS2 is a nice, solid system. It doesn't have the timeless appeal of the GameCube, but it doesn't sink to the level of the pathetic Xbox, either.Technology-wise, it's not as strong as either of the other systems. As we all know, it's the weakest graphically, and also has glitches like the occasional animation or sound problem.In the software department, the PS2 delivers with grace. I found a moderately wide selection of fun games, many of which were exclusive to the system.Although I've never experienced the problem myself, I've heard the news about ""disc read errors""...kinda has me worried.Overall, it's a competent and enjoyable console for the middle-of-the-road gamer."
3,Ehhhh.....,"I have a PS2 and an Xbox. I think they are both really fun and great, but I think the Xbox is a whole lot better. I like their games much better, first of all. the PS2 is not really directed towards me, as someone who looks for the best graphics, violence, and memory space. Also, my PS2 broke this week. I was carrying it, it fell on my rug, and now the disc opener won't open (this was while I had one of my faorite ps1 games,ff tactics, in it). So now I have to buy another system. But still, the games are pretty good, graphics are okay. The sh** that really bothers me was that it broke, ther's only 2 spots for the controllers, and you have to buy a memory card ( which are dreadfully expensive)."
3,Mediocre,"Better graphics than the Gamecube? Ha! Do you people even own Gamecubes? Well I own both, and GCN pwns PS2 in graphics, sorry. Not to take away that the PS2 is a quality system, it has some decent games, there just isn't alot good PS2 exclusive titles on it. GTA3 and Kingdom Hearts are going on other consoles, but you always have Jak and Daxter and Final Fantasy. But, PS2 is online, so points there. I myself am a whole-hearted Nintendo lover, so it's obvius that I like Gamecube more, but if GCN is not your thing, I reccomend the PS2."
4,Its good,"See, I like the PS2 because ther'res so many games and all, but before you buy it, consider 3 things - if you could live without nintendo games (mario, pokemon etc.) - if your expecting it to have a few problems when you first buy it, even if its your first game system or you fiftieth, it will still have some problems and youll have to adjust to it. and number 3 is that you have to be able to afford it. Used ones are obviously cheap, but i reccomend getting a new one because the problems that it has. so the graphics are no better than gamecube, or even though ive never played it, maybe x box, and another cool feature about the ps2 is it goes on its side or bottom. it is operated by a disc. i mean, the games are on a disc and it works like a cd drive on a computer.my personal favorite game is ratchet and clank. look for that game, cuz its fun. overall i think its good for a game-o-holic, but if u dont play video games much then dont buy it."
4,"good, if you like this kind of thing","I have ps2 and xbox, and a friend has gamecube. the ps2 is excellent for what i bought it for:Final Fantasy (insert number here), and anything else made by Square-Enixfor the rest, get xbox. non-FF games on ps2 are dissappointingly owned by xbox games all around. i have 3 games for ps2: (FFX, FFX-2, Kindom Hearts). On xbox i have 34 games.'nuff said."
4,Use your noodle,"It makes no sense to criticize the PS2 just because X-Box has better performance; of course it does, it was released like a year and half later. If you want to say PS2 sucks and X-Box rocks, fine, but get ready to say X-Box sucks when the new wave of consoles gets here."
4,HEY Justin And other people LISTEN UP,(...)XBOX has NO DDR wrong XBOX does have DDR a much better one and plus XBOX has much better games PS2 does not haveDOOM 3Half LIFE 2HALOHALO 2PROJECT GOTHEM RACINGAND MUCH MOREThats not all XBOX has better graphics and no memory card needed and Has better internet also A bit cheaperTAKE THAT PS2 XBOX OWNS
4,Yay for PS2,"The sony PS2 is an impressive machine. a wee bit pricey at $150 new, considering it has been out as long as the 99$ Gamecube. But for those who think the gamecube is slightly childish and the XBox is dark with violent 1st person shooters, the ps2 is the one for you. there is an enourmous amount of cool accesories avaliable for your PS2, and the number of currently released games still exceedes that of XBox and GC(GameCube). My verdict is, the PS2(although slightly dated for it's price), is more worthy a succesor to the ground-braking Sega Dreamcast than the XBox is by far. Go for the PS2."
1,Not good..........not good at all,"THis system is a piece of junk. It freezes a lot. ALso, the memory on mine corrupted after only 1 YEAR! Thats nothing. You have to also buy a memory card unlike xbox. Oh yeah, and i forgot.LOADING.........LOADINGLOADINGLOADINGLOADINGSTILL LOADING...You get my point. I played soul calibur on ps2 and on xbox. Their both the same, by the way, Heihachi sucks!, and ps2 took three times longer to load. Arrrrrrrgggggggggghhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,greatest system ( IM me at (blbuckinator),"This so far is the best system ever,there is no greater word i could use then perfect.The other reviewrs say this is a bad system because of the graphics but they need to no that this system is not bad because of the graphics.I mean it may not have as good graphics as the xbox or gamecube but the game selection is the widest and best out of all of the systems,and come to think of it the graphics are pretty good in the ps2.The good thing is that the ps2 has violent,shooter,child,sports games etc.The xbox for example has mostly violent games and the gamecube has mostly childish games.This system is by far the best system for moslty any person so take my recenmondation and buy this system.(this does not mean other systems are bad)."
1,Ps2 is bad XBOX IS BETTER,XBOX IS BETTER AND PS2 HAS GTA SAN ANDREAS WHICH SUCKS HALO 2 IS SO MUCH BETTER SONY SUCKS
1,1 star,Ps2 sucks it is loud has stupid games and it was made by retards.Ps2 sucks thats why your mamma made it!
1,Ps2 is boring,i have a Ps2 and an xbox and a GC but my game cube and ps2 arnt evn hooked up thats how boring they are. if your going to by a system buy an Xbox. Xbox has best graphics best controllers best games no need for memory cards four conttroller ports. Ps2 only 2 CONTROLLER PORTS!!! how can u play with all your friends without byin some stupid adapter. yes Ps2 does have alot of games but they all suck by an xbox
1,What is so cool about this system?,"I own a Nintendo GameCube and it is a whole lot more fun than a ps2. I don't see what is so great about this system. The hardware is outdated, the games suck ass, and it takes forever to load. Everybody says that the graphics are better on this system, bs, the graphics on GameCube are noticably better. Alot of people say that there are more games, well duh, it has been out for a year and a half to two years longer than GameCube. Everybody thinks that the dvd is so great. The dvd is nothing special because it skips a lot and doesn't last long at all. I don't like the design of the controllers either, plus Sony coudn't think of a new controller for this system(pathetic). My cousin has a ps2 and I played it and was not impressed at all. In my opinion, leave the video games to Nintendo because they are the only ones who can do it right."
1,bad products,"I bought this thinking it was playstation2 bought new paid bought a product thinking it was new, but when you receive, the frustration was a playstation dusty old used to control broken, it seems that the salesman is an irresponsible kid for selling a PRODOT this, and amazon.com accept that a seller places a product of this species for sale, product misused old and broken, but it did not happen"
1,The Glitters Are Not Truly Gold.,"Theres alot of flaws in this console. First of all is theGraphics are terrible!!! Back when ps1 and n64 was out i wasdown with n64. Plus this new small ass systems will burn upquickly. Especially if it has that Cord that was a recall.Dreamcast and gamecube even had better graphics than this.I Left my gamecube at my cousins house, i'm also fed upwith ps2 The only system i like thats on the marketis Xbox. The only reason I like Ps2 is the good varietyof games. That's the only reason you should get it too."
2,Not good at all,"I have a Gamecube and Xbox and a PS2 and by far the PS2 is the worst. The systems have their own speacal things. The Xbox has great shooters, the Gamecube has great kids games (Mario Games) but the ps2 has nothing! They barely have any original games!! The gamecube and Xbox have many original games. Also the PS2 games are not that great. The memory cards also cost a lot more than the Gamecube memory cards are a lot cheaper."
1,"old system, not game-friendly, not that great","PRO:-THE GAME HAVE SOME EXCLUSIVE GAMES: GTA AND METAL GEAR, BUT METAL GEAR IS NOT EXCLUSIBE ANYMORE SO YOU ONLY GOT ONE GOOD EXCLUSIVE-THE CONTROL IS THE BEST. PERIOD-LOTS OF AMTURE GAMES-DVD PLAYBACKCONS:-Don't except any MASTERPIECE-Old Visuals-the system will damage too quickit's hard to develop games on this console (except lack of quality)-It has the wort games ever released on a console, except Mary-Kate and Ashley bra-removing showdown-it's expensive (gemecube is cheaper and has some perfect 10 games"
3,Okay,"This is okay cause it makes one good DVD player. It has such a huge library, you're bound to find a game. But it's graphics are horrible. Like it was said earlier, look at some games, RE-hashed PS1. The DS proves it can do better than that. And the load times (groan). Get it if you don't like innovation."
4,Okay system until it breaks,"The PS2 is an okay system.After about 1 and a half years it broke . The PS2 doesnt even have that good games on it. The contollers are too small also.Now I have an X-Box which is much,much better than the PS2 four controller ports to PS2's 2.On X-Box you dont even need a memory card.Trust me DONT BUY A PS2."
4,Call me crazy but better then XBox,"This game is much better then xbox. More games you only have to pop in a dvd, put in the prental code and watch the dvd, don't have to buy a thing to play dvds, depending on games is depending on graphics, you can listen to cd's play PS games, you don't have to change to a differnt control system even though the PS2 dosen't have 4 control slots, it's better only having 2 slots because the less players you have on muliplayer, the more space you have to see whats going on and selling over400,000 systems in the first 48 hours it came out, a record breaker, I'd go with the PS2 anytime."
2,"Not bad, but worst of the three","First of all about this dvd player garbage - the dvd player sucks on it. The $35 Radio Shack dvd player is better. Anybody who touts the dvd player as a bonus knows very little about home electronics. PS2 has some good games, but every system does. However, I have had to send my PS2 in twice to get fixed. It still does not read blue disc games well. The online play for any system is trumped by a PC. Nothing can beat a PC when it comes to online games. I am not a huge fan of any of the consoles, but I would have to say GC is the best. The people who sit here and give 5 stars to PS2 are extreme loyalists. They make no effort to be objective. Once you are done with GTA, the other games are woeful. The controller for PS2 is the first one to give me blisters since NES. The loading times are pitiful. For a company that makes very good home theatre products, Sony does a lousy job on the PS2 Don't buy a PS2 if you are undecided about the three."
4,cant......... resist .........FUN!!!!!!!!!!!,"I havnt gotten one yet but I am going to.when i first played a PS2 i was amazed.I thought it was so cool.I mean really,it as all the cool games like Kingdom Hearts,and the .Hack searies. If you are strugguling to find out which systam Gamecube,xbox,or PS2 to get, take my advice and get a PS2."
5,ps2 rocks,"Most of these pricks that dis ps2 are just a bunch of ignorant xbox jerks. First of all, you dont have to buy another ps2 to have 4 players. in fact, you can have 8 players on one ps2 with 2 multitaps. Xbox though, needs to hook up with another xbox to achieve that. Also, ps2 DOES have voice chat, for almost every single recent online game that has come out, and playing ps2 online is way cheaper. all you need is a network adapter that costs 40 dollars and you can play online as much as you want, no monthly or annual fee. Xbox on the other hand costs 70 dollars to buy, and 50 dollars to renew the xbox live subscription every year. I'm not sure if it's 50 or 60. Gc also has a monthly fee. also, what does the name xbox have anything to do with video games? If you have to choose one of the consoles, i suggest ps2. my second choice would be a laptop, which is basically the same thing as an xbox."
2,Ok price but wrong order AGAIN,I recived the ps2 with the wrong AV cord not that bad considering last year when i bought a ps2 off of them i got a controller that barely worked
3,Great Piece of Equipment!!,"I had bought this Play Station 2 console a couple months ago but when I recieved it looked like a real old one but it worked awesome and looks in great shape. The one I was looking for was a larger game console the one I got was a smaller one.I had seen the larger one at a friends house thats why I liked the Play station 2 but the Console works great. I totally recommend this to any Play Station 2 gamers but ask for pictures of what kind of Play Station 2 you are getting ok.( I had asked the seller I bought mine from for some pictures of it and he had no problem of give me some, so if you can ask for pictures so you know what kind you are getting)"
5,Classic duo - classic performance,"This is one of the all time great performance by the duo of Corea and Burton. Chick the master of the keyboards and Gary the innovator of using four hammers to play the vides. The videography was well done, you get a chance to see both of these masters of their respective instruments at work. The tunes on the disk are all worthy of the listen. On the whole, every time I watch this DVD I find myself wishing that I had been there to hear them live in addition to being able to watch the performance again and again on the DVD."
1,The Road To Boredom,"Sadly, this book does not live up to its title. The story is hackneyed,uninspired and not very well thought out. In truth, the story line appears to have been thrown together during a coffee break. The writer, Jabari Asim, seems incapable of making the reader believe in the books characters .... for they appear dull, uninteresting and frankly, boring. This novel has obviously streched Mr Asim's limited capabilities as a writer to the limit ... and it clearly shows. I would not recommend this novel to anyone.I read this book whilst traveling on a long train journey. Next time I travel, I shall fly."
4,Selected poems/ The Rising and Pope in My Bedroom,"I admit I have not read the book for sale here but have come to Janet's work via a different route. I curate/edit a column (Pure Hash) in Mental Contagion, a monthly online paper of arts and letters.Janet submitted five poems to us and I was instantly drawn to her plainspoken, non-judgemental and razor sharp voice, evident in the two poems listed above, which we will publish in our October issue. As she engages intimately and honestly with the world around and within her, she is all at once gentle and ruthless -- a refreshing, pure endeavor undertaken with each poem. I am particularly taken with how she bravely meshes her own mortality with the family members she has loved and grieved."
4,Intimate like a family album,Sightlines is intimate like a family album. It is the book of memories that I have always hoped to find in my grandmother's attic. The colors are muted and inside are old snapshots of loved ones and personal stories written into poetry with a soft blue pen.Janet Riehl's use of coloquial language and frank observation invited me the to participate as if I was sitting on the couch with my best friend.
3,Vol. 2 Gay Happening,"First I want say I am very disappointed in how this order was handled. I made the order on the 3rd of feb, recieved an e-mail on the 4th of feb saying it was shipped. It was not shipped on the 4th of feb. 2nd I sent e-mail asking if it had been shipped, I never recieved an e-mail till 18th of feb with the date should arrive by. That most certainly is not the answer to give a paying customer, in the future answer the question that was asked. I recieved it today 4 days before the experation day of said arrival date. Onto the product...this cd had couple of scratches, however it played. The first song in the begining was kind of choppy, but can be fixed with a little help from the internet. I also want to add this, if I ever order {doubt it though} from you again expect my order to be shipped in a timely manner, after all you did recieve your money the same day I placed the order. CUSTOMER SATISFACTION is the key here, if your happy so should we as the customer!"
1,Too much money,"They sell a similar Mac at Walmart with three of the ""cars"" automobiles in it. It only costs $19.99! This one is priced way too high."
2,Meh,"My 3 year old LOVES the classic Mack the Truck. It can hold most of the Cars- up to two at a time for most of them. It has lots of play features. Most are goofy (toothbrush, video game) but my little guy loves it. I dunno. Mack didn't look like this in the movie so I recommend you get the one with the closed panels and the Lightning McQueen graphics on the side. That's how he looked in the movie. You can get the Cars (if and when you can find them) for a few bucks a pop. And Sally and Doc aren't that hard to find. This version of Mac is basically the Mac cab and some new open-air funky transporter, but who wants that when you can have the classic version."
5,Awesome,"foreigner 4 brings you back when music was awesome. Jukebox hero, nightlife, I find myself always singing to myself these old classics"
1,Item does not work according to specification,"I am a daily bicycle rider approximately pedaling 10 kmiles a year. I am not satisfied with this product as it does not work according to specification. I am merely getting 1 hour of run time. The advertised 10 W of light power does not compare to an LED based lamp. Further, the charger is uncontrolled, which means that the charge time needs to be verified manually. This makes it impractical in daily usage, as I would envision to keep it on the charger when not riding; in order to always have a full charge when leaving the house. Unfortunately I would not recommend this item."
5,Sublime,"This CD is sublime. It is simply beautiful. One of the best trance tracks I've heard. I bought it cos it had reincarnation and Did You Hear Me on it and I guessed if those tracks were on it, everything else would be good as well. I was right. Perfection."
3,Love--we all need it.,"Back Cover description: Self-control was only a mask she wore. Gina Bennett, victim of a freak accident, had suffered plenty. She wasn't about to let her publisher, Leo Sterne, open old wounds--especially the memory of her disastrous first infatuation. It was bad enough that Leo thought she'd ruined his sister's marriage....Now he wanted much more than an admission of her guilt. He needed her to help his deaf young son. And against his will, he wanted her. All Gina wanted was to forget--forget the past, her loneliness and her need for love. But Leo and the boy made that impossible.Gina had an accident at 16; she lost the use of her voice. She finally has it back, and runs into Leo on his island. Leo is dragging his own emotional baggage around and to top it off he finally gets custody of his son. Lots of different plot threads here and an unusual storyline. Fans of Ms. Napier should give this a try."
3,1620 digital Camera,"This camera works OK for what I paid for it. If you change batteries you loose the pictures in the camera , so download any pictures before changing the baattaries"
3,Graphic SF Reader,"Pretty much anything Ellis writes is worth looking at, and Constantine as a character is a natural for his style, with stories looking at different facets of this dishevelled magician's character. Ellis is also probably jealous that John is better looking than him, and more women take off their clothes for him, too. Some short act pieces, here."
5,Excellent beginning and overview,"This book is an excellent introduction and overview to the use of herbs in pregnancy. A great starter to work from, and easy to move on from this book to research more in depth from other sources. Easy to read and nicely put together."
1,I hated this novel!,No redeeming value in this novel. Hateful characters. Convoluted plot. Lousy dialogue. Save your money...and your time.
1,One of the worst books I've ever read.,"Without a doubt this is one of the worst books that I've ever read. The writing is poor, the plot weak. As I read this book I found myself continually trying to figure out where this particular paragraph fits into the story. It's as if the author didn't know how to tie thoughts together so he didn't even try.I see from another review that the two main characters were from previous books, and perhaps reading those would have helped with some background on them.But even so I find it hard to believe that knowing their background would have made the book any more enjoyable.Many times I set the book down thinking I would just throw it away, but I'm very persistant and kept reading thinking that the book HAD to get better. Unfortunately it didn't.The book ended and I was left trying to figure out what happened. In the end I got nothing out of this book but lost time."
5,So good that its spooky,"James Crumley is almost frightening in the way he writes. He evokes things that most authors can only dream of. He is, in this humble man's opinion, the greatest living American author today. With Milo and Sughrue on the trail of decay, they step into, and fall over everything that our parents warned us about. His lyrical prose is haunting, and leaves me with a taste to read - like Vonnegut's Cat's Cradle-Crumley makes reading fun. Please Mr. Crumley give us more."
5,Please Keep Making These,"I have an old, old vaccum that keeps on ticking. I am so glad I can still get the bags for them. They got to me super quick which made my day, since my last one was almost full."
2,It's not what you think,"O.k., so I'm breakin' Hip-Hop rule #2010: Neva, EVA, EVA diss the T'Cha. But it's not really a dis: more like a warning. You go to the record store, you see a KRS One album you've never seen before with a 2001 date on it and you figure he's pullin' another Sneak Attack, right...just hittin' his hard-core, hip-hop respectin' fans off lovely, right. Well, first things first...it's actualy from 96. Secondly, not a single lyric from Kris...not a single lyric at all, actually. It's a bunch of beats. Experimental beats at that. I give the concept 6 1/2 stars...proving Kris cares about the EMcees and breakdancers. Poorly executed. Beats don't bang. I've already got my point across. I'm out."

I give the concept 6 1/2 stars...proving Kris cares about the EMcees and breakdancers. However, IMO this is poorly executed. The beats are experimental and don't bang. Maybe the real breakdancers out there will appreciate this. But for the average hip-hop connoisseur, it's probably not what you're looking for."
3,Cappucino chairs,"Arrived within a week of ordering. Easy to put together if you lightly fix each bolt in place when putting the seat on the back. Once you have all the bolts lined up and started, tighten each one a little bit in turn until tight. Just as viewed online. Glossy faux leather surface and matching legs. One of the 4 we purchased wobble a little, but will fix with a felt pad to even the leg length. Great buy, but not the highest quality."
5,Contents:,"A revolution, a crime, a remarkable boy, a honeymoon, a war...a generation revealed 1970-1979.White Kids is Wolff's tenderly absurd account of what came after the sixties were gone. The conservatism, the nostalgia, the malaise, the hoping against all hope for a little style and love. In this extraordinary portrait of a generation, we understand in an altogether new way what it means to be free, white and 21."
3,"The lil penquin that could, but is dead",It is a stuffed animal for entertainment. It came in new condition and was given to a 1 year old for his birthday. He enjoyed staring at it for a while but now sits on display until he is older. The theme for his first birthday was Skelanimals. This was the purpose of the gift.
4,The saddest song ever written!,"Marie Burns' singing on ""River of Sorrow"" (which she wrote) is worth the purchase price alone. Close the bedroom door if you don't want people to see you crying! And, as if that weren't enough, she also sings a beautiful version of the second saddest song ever written, A P Carter's ""I'll be all smiles tonight""."
3,Gives some support,Glove helps some for the wrist but did little for the thumb injury that I needed to be supported. Size seems to be off; the glove is almost too tight & I usually wear a small & the one I ordered was a medium.
2,"love shesus, hate the ep","such a disappointment from one of my favorite Ohio bands. The songcraft is all over the freakin place and the audio production is weighed down by bad choices. too guitar heavy from a band that is good, but really isn't god's gift to guitar playing. the best thing about shesus is the lead singer, heather, and they've got her buried up under all these guitars played through all these stupid pedals. Off to the cut out bin."
2,Summer fluff...,"If you're looking for light summer reading that will pass quickly and not stay with you, this book is for you. I found the writing style a bit sophomoric and the storyline was predictable, but all in all, it's light, airy and just right for the beach."
3,Predictable and boring,MAKING OVER MIKE was an okay book. The only reason I kept reading it was because I had nothing else to read. It's not fun or sexy or..... all the stuff the reviewers say it is. It's stupid and boring.
3,This is Not a Book,"I've spent the last week watching this season instead of reading the copy of The Public Burning that I found in the library donation bin. My mother sent to me, as a warning I think. I told her I don't go out after nine pm, but I think she's still determined to scare me. I chopped the season in half and watched it in two chunks. It hurts now. I feel like my brain has been poisoned. Who are these people? I had a nightmare, Chris Meloni in a tanktop, his Christ tattoo mysteriously upside down, trying to convince me I'd been raped. Nightmares from this show. I think my mother wanted to talk me out of ever moving to New York. I wouldn't anyway: no sense of direction. Nightmares. I'm so involved in this, I bought the next three seasons and maxed out my credit card. Good stuff."
2,Law and Order,"Law and Order Special Victims Unit sure did live up to its name: I was victimized out of $46.62. I can't speak for the series itself because I haven't had the displeasure of seeing it yet, but as far as the aggregation of shows on this kit goes, I found them very tedious and the acting to be over-dramatized. The roles these people played were very unbelievable to a point of fantasy. If they wanted to make a successful show they would've show the real grits of being these aforementioned parts."
2,Extremely Disappointing,"I had never watched Law and Order, SVU, but read the reviews, talked with viewers and purchased the first season. It was outstanding! Believing the fifth season would be just as well done, I purchased it. OOPS! Each episode begins well...but the detectives soon become ""errand runners"" for the new attorney. Much of the episode is devoted to a trial which - unfortunately - follows a formula. I've fallen asleep during three episodes! Granted I'm not much of a TV sitter, but my college student son returned during spring break and fell asleep EACH time he watched an episode! Unless you have insomnia, consider another purchase!"
5,excellente série !,J'adore et je suis contente d'avoir pu commander cette superbe série en vost ! Amazon est rapide et fiable !
3,Law & Order Special Victims Unit - 5th Year 2003-2004,"The series is very good, but some episodes are a bit heavy for my taste. Nonetheless, if you like crime series, go for it!"
3,Duplicate DVDs,"Dear Sir,Unfortunately, I have had a bad experience with this item, as I am a fan of the series, after ordering and receiving all seasons from Amazon and while watching the 5th season, I passed through an unpleasant experience as there was a duplication in one of the DVDs within the 5th season and namely it was the 5th disc in that season that was duplicated. Unfortunately i have missed on all the episodes on the 6th DVD of the 5th season and hence lost track of the events in the series. I hope this can be rectified from your side in a certain way, as I have really lost track of events, and now the rest of the series does not fall in place because of those missing episodes on the 6th DVD of the 5th season. I hope this can be rectified.Looking forward to a feedback.Thank you"
2,Bonsai Basics,"As a bonsai enthusiast (NOT master!), I have been designing bonsai for several years, and have acquired a few dozen books on the subject. Personally, I was unimpressed with this book. While it had some valid information, I noticed incorrect techniques photographed (trees with wire cutting in to the bark, or having wire scars). I didn't find the book particularly helpful."
2,Muddled Explanations Spoil an Informative Book,"As a complete beginner I thought that this book would be the perfect way to get into bonsai. While it does seem to have been written by a couple of very experienced people, I had trouble finding any real step-by-step descriptions. They seem to bounce around too much and even after several passes through the book, I still don't feel like I have a firm grasp of the full process (which they advertise as the point of the book). I would suggest looking elsewhere. The book may be a complete source of bonsai information, but I was left confused as I found myself repeatedly flipping back and fourth looking for information that should have been grouped together."
1,Bizarre,"Major leaguers, and even Ted Williams, do not and did not bat like Steve Ferroli recommends. This instuctor has the batter turning his head and not watching the baseball in order to facilitate better hip movement. Do you believe that? You actually turn your head and lose sight of the baseball before it strikes the bat, on purpose. According to Steve, bats shouldn't be angled skyward but pointed straight back, parallel to the ground. There are too many techniques and tips in this book that can only be described as bizarre. Major Leaguers, the best batters in the world, do not use the Steve Ferroli method."
1,Avoid this book,"Ted Williams book, the science of hitting, is a good book. This one is not. Mr. Ferroli has a rigid view of what a good swing should be. There isn't just ""one"" right swing and a good swing is only one important facet of being a successful hitter. I have boys who play in little league, high school, and D1 college. The ideas in this book are so off-the-mark that I literally threw the book away so my boys wouldn't read any of it. It is that bad. Just my opinion, but if your looking for good books on the swing: stick with Williams book, books by Dusty Baker (for the beginner), or Charley Lau Sr. book. Those are some of the best."
2,It's cheap looking.,"When I received my mask I was so excited it came in fast, but when I opened the box I pulled out the mask and a feather fell off. Then I went and tried it on and the black/gold ribbons on one of the sides came completely off. It was huge did not fit my face at all. I was very disappointed. :("
2,Feather is weird!,The mask is what they described but the feather was glued very odd. And the feather was not protected as they claimed. Not recommended.
5,Loved this Mask,"This mask was a great hit at party. One of the tassles came off, but can easily be glued back on."
1,broke before even got to wear it,This broke before I even got to wear it very pretty but useless when it just breaks before wearing it.
2,This is a coffee table book.,"It's the kind of book where you get it, you look at it, maybe you look at it again, then you put it somewhere, maybe look at it again a few years later. Tom Shatel is a talented enough writer to put his efforts into something a little more substantial than a fan's list of big Husker wins."
4,OFTK over OA,"""Ocean Avenue"" is well crafted, and its what got Yellowcard mainstream, although I find it wasn't as good as their older albums like ""One For The Kids"" it was still something I love to listen to. Although I warn you, if you listen to it too much, it will get old. Now the reason I don't like this as much as OFTK is because, it didn't have the same rough edging and melodies to it, it was more poppy. What I find is people won't listen to it, because they think yellowcard sold out, which of course they didn't, MTV(manure tasting (tran)vestites) was trying to sell them out. But yellowcard will always be loved as the sweet-hearted guys, rather then the boys who got selled out by MTV.this CD also includes Firewater which is a fan favorite!"
5,Easy to find at Amazon.com,Very hard to find except at Amazon.com. My wife has been using this product for many years and loves it. It is no longer available in our local stores and has been hard to find unless you are an Amazon shopper. Amazon.com keep up the good work!
5,"Makes you feel ""so good"" after your bath.",The smell is not over whelming and stays with you a long time. People get a drift of smell as you go by them.
5,The last resort,"Recently, my grandson got Halloween makeup on the carpeting in his room. I tried every stain remover I had and nothing worked - except my Magic Wand Stain Remover. Since I didn't have much left, and there were lots of stains, I looked on the web and was delighted to find it was still available. (I had looked in many local stores without finding it.) I bought one so i could finish removing those %@#%@ stains!This is an amazing product. Most stain removers say they can remove any stain - they lie. This one can."
5,LONG TIME USER,"I first bought this item many years ago at a K-Mart. I kept buying it there and at Meijer until they no longer carried it. It lasts a very long time and it takes out stains that NO other remover has been able to touch. I missed it very much, trying many others but none even comes close. I'm so thrilled I can purchase it here!"
5,I keep coming back to Magic Wand.,"I keep trying other stain removal products, but I keep coming back to the 1 I have used for years: Magic Wand."
2,Stain stick,I tried this aboard a Princess Cruise ship. I used it for the first time on my sweetie's 'ring around the collar' and it only was fair. And it seemed to use up a lot of the product. I always have high hopes and the reality is often different.
3,meh,I was hoping for something a little better than this. It works just okay if that's what you're looking for...
1,Useless,"Tried it on a couple of stains on cotton, followed all the instructions to the letter, this product proved to be completely useless, waste of money, goes right into trash. Should have been a -5!"
4,Pathetic...but rewarding,"Being an immigrant, picking up the English language took a few years of my life. This is not only the first book in English that I read in its entirety, but also one which spawned a lifelong enjoyment of reading and education without which a Chinese lawyer would have otherwise never risen above the poverty of his childood."

4,Classic Rayman Platforming,"The GBA version of Raving Rabbids is nothing like the console versions. Rather than a mini-game collection, it's a throw-back to the older platforming Rayman games. The Rabbids are there, but they are now generic bad guys and lose a lot of their charm. The rest of the game feels like a remix of the original Rayman games.So basically, if you liked the old school Rayman games (or the new Rayman Origins game) you might like Raving Rabbids. If you're looking for a GBA version of the console Raving Rabbids game (i.e. a bunch of mini games) this isn't what you're looking for."
3,UnHappy,"My boyfriend had ordered this Ankle Bracelet for me for valentines day. Although the item is very beautiful when i had gotten it, It didn't fit my ankle. Other then this item not fitting around my ankle everything else was fine, it shipped and got here on time."
1,Poor Quality,"Purchased this item and was very disappointed in the quality, cheaply made clasp was very fragile and a stone fell out on the first day of wear, lasted two days before the clasp broke."
5,Pearls Au Lait Milk Bath for Dogs and Cats,"I had my item shipped and received within a week of my order. I ordered four bottles of milk bath product. All of the bottles arrived packaged neatly and nothing was damaged during the shipment. The price I paid for the milk bath was very reasonable. I loved this product for our dogs and have used it for several years, however for some reason all of the local pet stores have discontinued carrying it. I will definitely come back here when I need to reorder this product!"
3,Cayennne,Because I just received this and have just started using it I rated it low. I haven't had enough enough time for a fair evaluation of the product but based I past reviews I decided to try it. I like reading the reviews before I purchase something and in most cases they are very valuable.
2,Not all the same,"Not all New Mexico red chile is the same! We real New Mexicans know that you'd want Hatch chile for the best enchiladas, Luna County chile for a pot of chile con frijoles, and real nutty, sweet Chimayo chile for the best Carne Adovada on earth.Who knows that this stuff is? It's a passable generic but if it was the 'good stuff,' Corona Real would at least know that it's illegal to spell chile as 'chili' here in New Mexico.Sure, this stuff makes an OK recipe or molido sauce, but for a true cognoscenti, it doesn't cut it."
4,why i like the hoover brush vac,"I like the Hoover brush-vac because it picks up so well. It picks up on bare floors as well as carpeted floors.I also have the Singer 3 in one ""stick-vac"" but the Hoover is superior on carpeting because it has the revoling brush to help get every particle from the rug.My son likes to borrow it to clean up after his 3 and 6 year olds. I would recommend this to anyone."
3,Authentic,"I recently purchased this via Amazon. Delivery was very prompt and professional. Other reviews are correct. This stuff is very potent and authentic. I recall this scent prevelent during my days in England. Having said that, if used sparingly, it is very pleasent as I have had several positive comments already. It is unfortunate that this is available only in a mister bottle. Better ""volume"" control could be had with a standard open cap system. You will have to experiment but it's possible to use this stuff without overdoing it. One full spray directly on your body from the mister is far too much. It's better to get a ""partial"" spray on to one finger tip and apply to differnt body points then wash your hands. Or, as one reviewer stated, use it in the shower so as to dilute the mist before it hits your skin. it will take a lot of practice to get this right."
2,Even if you love sandalwood........,"I purchased this product through a local gentleman's shop - I hate to say the price point there compared to Amazon - but to make a long story short I have been pretty disappointed.It's very, very strong - in my opinion too strong as a cologne. The only success I've had with it has been to use it in the shower where it can disperse through the water vapor.Is it authentic? You bet. Unfortunately, it's not the most comfortable sandalwood scent I've ever sniffed. It's certainly not the soft incensy sort - it's woody to the point of harshness, and it's not just walking the line on that mark, it's dancing on the grave.I wouldn't recommend this unless you're doing a study on English cologne products or a sandalwood collector. I myself have always been a fan of most things sandalwood, and it was just too much for me."
4,Coffee Butler,Purchased as a gift. Arrived damaged. Send a note to company but no response. Gave them a call and they quickly sent another one which arrived in perfect condition. Very nice customer service manners.
2,Coffee Carafe,"In fairness, I cannot properly rate the product as it was a Mother's Day gift, which exceeded the expected delivery date by over a week. Amazon's use of this vendor reflects poorly on an otherwise great experience over the last four years of online purchases. I will not recommend this carafe/vendor to anyone."
1,Doesn't Work,"This didn't work at all for me. I needed one because my laptop docking station (for an IBM Thinkpad) only has 1 USB port, so to add both a keyboard and mouse, I needed an extra USB port. This seemed to fit the bill, but it just don't work... simple as that. The device is recognized as a USB hub in windows, but anything you plug into it is not recognized. This is unfortunate as Iogear usually make pretty decent products."
3,"Works, but cord short","It works fine, but the very short cord makes for some tricky wire configurations when full."
5,Simply great,"I got this iogear microhub two weeks ago, and it simply works great. My laptop has two usb ports, and I need 4 (mouse, webcam, card reader, external hard drive), so it was a very simple and cheap fix. As people already said, it's better not to connect your external hard drive to it. I am using my other empty usb port to connect my external hard drive, and I am connect the 3 other devices to hub. I can't comment on its durability, but everything looks fine until now.Aboujouj83<a href=""http://www.WePromote.ca"">We promote!</a>"
3,Good for the price,"Despite the fact that it lasted only six months, I'd buy another if it were still available for the same price.That being said, the short (less than one inch) permanently attached USB cable means that you will eventually put enough strain on it to cause it to fail.It's small and compact, but I would have preferred something larger that allowed me to provide my own mini USB cable to connect to the computer."
3,"small, quick, works well.","3.5 starsI'm not quite sure what in the world some of the reviewers here are plugging into this hub, but it never gets hot. Hot enough to burn? Are you kidding?Anyways, I digress. Picked this little thing up for $20 at microcenter and it's been pretty good. I agree with the reviewer below me in that it is rather finicky when you plug in new things to it and will sometimes disconnect your devices in the process. That sounds like a big deal and it definitely can be if you have your data that's just critical. I've got music on my lone external connected to it so it doesn't matter.Works well for the money. If you're looking for something a little more stable on the connects and disconnects, give another hub a try before this one.-Travis4-24-09edit: (I wish you could edit your stars too).I downgrade this review to 2/2.5 stars out of 5. Not really because of overheating but because it was just a POS whose ports started acting strange after like 3 weeks. Lame."
1,"Horrible, complete waste of money","OK so it CAN work if you leave everything alone. But man is it annoying if you ever need to plug in different devices.At first use I thought it was totally defective, then after moving it around a little I found out that when the usb cable is turned certain ways it disconnects everything!! That's a nice touch, especially if I were doing something important and lost data.Finally after moving it in just the right way, my devices started showing up but as soon as I need to plug something else in which requires barely moving the hub to pick it up and unplug, everything gets disconnected until I move it back into position.What a horrible product."
4,"Good value, nice and compact","Great value for the money, very small and compact, travels easily. The only negative I have is the perceived long-term quality of the plastic used."
3,Cheapest USB Hub,"Good product, but my 2.5"" usb harddisk enclose have problems with working with this product. Else, seems better product."
1,"Hot, Really Hot","This mini USB hub heat up very fast, even it just connected to one mp3 player. Don't buy it!"
3,IOGEAR USB Hub,"it's a 4 port USB hub with a very short USB cable. Good for the laptop, not so good for a desktop computer."
4,DOES THE JOB SO FAR,"THIS HUB , LIKE ALL I'VE USED, INSTALLS EASILY. IT IS HALF THE SIZE OF THE OTHER HUBS. THE POCKET UNDERNEATH FOR CORD STORAGE AND THE SIZE MAKE ME THINK IT WAS DESIGNED FOR TRAVEL WITH A NOTEBOOK. IT IS VERY WARM TO THE TOUCH COMPARED WITH MY OTHER HUBS. I HOPE THIS DOESN'T MEAN A SHORT LIFE. THE SHORT CORD IS NOT A PROBLEM FOR MY DELL DESKTOP, IT HAS USB PORTS NEAR THE BASE IN FRONT. BUY A USB EXTENSION CORD IF NEEDED. THE ONLY TIME AN AC POWER ADAPTER FOR THE HUB IS RECOMMENDED IS WHEN PLUGGING IN AN EXTERNAL HARD DRIVE. NO PROBLEMS WITH ITS FUNCTION SO FAR. BEST WISHES."
2,too hot to handle!,"I liked this hub upon getting it and it loads very easily..just plug and play on XP, but it got very, very hot after just an hour or so and so I am shipping it back and hoping to find one that isn't such a hazzard. It sat directly on my desk and the underneith side was way too hot. After awhile, it would discolor my desk, if not dry/burn it. Sorry, the price was right, but the performance wasn't. Keep looking."
1,"After 1 year, one port doesn't work","My unit gets hot, but not that bad. After about 1 year, one of the ports stop working for no explainable reason. If it weren't for that I would have rated this unit higher given it's functionality and price.Actually 3 out of 4 ports now don't work...(about two months after I posted this review originally)"
2,Small and cute but overheats,"Strengths:* small and lightweight* attractive designWeaknesses:* Heats up very quickly, even without using any of the 4 portsThe waste heat is annoying and may be a deal killer... could this draw a significant amount of power from laptop batteries?"
2,Small is good but short cord is not,"I loved how small this hub is and the design is cool except that the cord from it that hooks into the computer is only 2 inches long. Therefore the hub just sticks straight out from the side of the laptop, taking up valuable desk space since my USB ports are on the side, not the back. It'd be better if the cord was not built in and it came with a longer one."
1,Lasted maybe one year,"I'm on Amazon tonight looking for a new hub since this one has given up the ghost. Other than the heat it produced itself, the hub faced no stresses from travel or frequent use--it just sat on my desk. It lasted maybe 15 months or so."
1,Do not buy that hub...,"This hub is worst thing I ever bought on Amazon.com .It cannot provide enough power for all 4 ports, my IPod(with HDD) started to make weird noises thru my speakers(i can hear every move of HDD now).to handle more than 2 devices you would need to buy optional power adapter(not available in RadioShack or in any other RETAIL store)You can buy online from IOGEAR's partner for $17.95(hub costs $9.95!!)So you better avoid buying that, better get some other brand hub like Kensington...or smthn like that."
2,Longevity is questionable,"This hub worked for me magically for a month or two, than began to have issues. It would occasionally fail to connect or just straight disconnect from devices plugged into it. After about 8 months, it became so unreliable that I stopped using it all together."
1,"Poor quality, Don't buy it","After I plugged in two flash memory sticks into this IOGear USB hub, the unit gets very hot after some hours of usage. The casing get so hot that I can smell the odor of plastic burning. These are very poor quality products and pose potential fire Hazardous. I cannot imagine the unit will incinerate immediately after you pluge in all ports. Avoid this by all means."
5,small and simple to use,Great little hub for a desktop or laptop computer. The size makes it prefect for travel or placement out of the way on a desktop. You can us this hub in a powered or unpowered mode. This makes it one of the best hubs I have ever owned. I would buy one again!
2,There are Better.,"It looks nice, but it is made for very BASIC connectivity and LOW usage. It overheats too easily and some ports ends up not working at all.I owned 2 of them, and the same thing happened."
2,Poor performance,"Cheaper option is not the best some time and here you have one. It can't support my mobile phone or my portable hard drive, some time I need to unplug and plug again in order to use. If you have money go to a better one."
2,compact and cheap but overheats quickly,This hub lasted me about 8 months before the heat it produced ended up frying the circuitry inside.
5,Works fine,Bought this because it was cheap and it does the job. if you need a powered hub you can buy a power brick for this from iogear.
1,An inefficient space heater,"USB hubs are supposed to make our lives simpler. This one will probably make your life more complex. It will initially do this by overheating. This is bad for two reasons. First, if you're attracted to such a micro-sized device, you're probably planning to use it with a laptop. All that heat is energy being sucked out of your laptop's battery, reducing the time you'll be able to play freecell while waiting at the airport terminal. The other reason overheating is bad is that it will quit working.After a year of on-and-off use, my Iogear GUH275 4-Port Hi-Speed USB 2.0 MicroHub still works perfectly...for heating the surface under it. But it is unable to connect my keyboard and mouse to my computer. Today it went into the trash. Anybody know where I can find a good USB space heater?"
1,Hub fails over time,"When my printouts would come out garbled, I first blamed the printer, then the computer. Little did I know that my Iogear hub was the culprit. I tested it on a PC and a Mac, same thing. So after a few months use, it just failed. I suspect it gets too hot for the chips inside. Stay away from this device."
3,"OK, but no cigar.","I was pleased when I got this hub at its size and design, since I needed to do some foreign travel. It seemed a good deal at $11. It ran rather hot from the beginning, but as the customer service man told me this was typical. However, after about eight months of use, it stopped being able to recognize anything but my mouse, including my external keyboard. I expect that this item really requires the optional external power adapter in order to run even a keyboard, but (1) that is not convenient for travel, and (2) at a hefty $17 plus shipping, the adapter cost dwarfs that of the hub itself. I ordered another model hub that, though a little more expensive, runs cool and well with multiple devices, even without an adapeter, and in any case includes as adapter with its price. I would not recommend this hub to anyone who had more than occasional use of multiple devices."
1,"Terrible, loses power to connected devices","I bought this for the same reason as previous reviewers, my Powerbook has only 2 USB ports and I needed more.When connecting mouse to the Hub, the cursor will skip like crazy (tried it with Apple's Mighty Mouse and Logitechs' cordless laser mouse)When connecting an iPod or an external hard drive, it will disconnect them w/o reason, and this can really mess things up.So stay clear of this one, don't make the same mistake I made, you really get what you pay for. It's better to spend ~$30 on a hub that will work perfectly than to end up with a $10 one that does not work at all."
1,You get what you pay for,"Totally unreliable.I thought this would be a cheap way of adding USB ports to my older desktop. So I plugged it in to my sole USB 2.0 port, inserted an optical mouse and another USB device, and lo and behold! My monitor was dead as a doornail. Unplugged the hub, plugged the mouse in directly, Voila! I'm back in business.Tried the gizmo on a new Dell laptop. Plugged in two devices for a few minutes. The hub was hot to the touch.I would avoid this device like the plague."
3,It was a neat video but way to short.,"The idea was really cool, they would slow down plays and talk about the mathematics and science behind them. They would talk about the math and science of punts, tackles, speed, throwing the ball and catching. They would slow down plays so you can really see all that goes on to your body. But the film is really short and there really are no extras on the disc that are worth watching. I would wait for it to air on NFL network are drop lower in price."
4,A nice and detailed introduction to Americal Football with amazing footage!,"This is a really nice and detailed introduction to Americal Football by NFL.This blu-ray contains amazing high resolution footage and I was stunned watching the Phantom slow-motion camera at work.This is a ""must see"" for anyone the least interested in the sport or just wanting some good quality blu-ray action for your new television set! :)"
4,"Fun, Casual Documentary with AWESOME Visuals","Anxiously waited for this to come out.. If you're a football fan, and enjoy shows like ""Time Warp"" on Discovery, then you'll love this great little documentary. Does a nice job of documenting the 2009 season with awesome cinematography utilizing new 1000fps cameras.Also contains an awesome bonus documentary on NFL Films' production house. Great for film nerds like myself.Excellent value, if you're into this sort of thing. Also great if you're looking for some nice reference material to show off your HDTV."
4,FUN FUN FUN!!!!!!!,"This is not a toy!! It is for Simpsons fans only! It has Simpsons cards, which can be played as a game. It is really fun, and I would reccomend this for only people that are 10+. It just would not be fun for younger people. Get it, and any of the other cards like Bart, Homer, Lisa and Marge."
4,BOTH BUSINESS AND PLEASURE,"Now here are two motivating, down-home ladies strengthened by family ties, enough to make a success of their dream. It wasn't always smooth ""selling"" for these two. But they persevered with the help of their loved ones. And they generously included them in the success. To think it all began with a textured baking sheet for Cub Scouts. Bette owes a lot to her husband Brooks!Diane and Bette are here to tell their story - the ups, the downs, the important lessons and the crazy ones. ""The Doughmakers Cookbook"" chronicles a family bakeware business and what better way to present it than with 125 mouth-watering recipes? The recipes are easy and the pictures included will tempt your taste buds. The recipes are a baker's delight. The ladies cover bread, cookies, rolls, cakes, muffins, pastry, pies and pizza. It's a cookbook fascinating enough to share with your extended family."
2,Heart - Greatest Hits 1985-1995,"Nowhere near as good, in MY opinion, as ""Hearts Essential"". It won't get as much play time as HEARTS ESSENTIAL."
5,Great Songs - Stale Production,"I bought this on a lark because I have been enjoying Jupiter Darling and the first greatest hits collection.I have to say I'm surprised that the quality of songs is equally high, though more adult contemporary and less hard rocking than early Heart.Like many other groups striving to maintain their popularity, Heart adopted production techniques that ultimately dated a huge portion of their catalog sampled here. Reverb-laden ""big room"" drumming abounds as do painful synth parts - many of which substitute for Nancy Wilson's always tasteful guitar arrangements. Its a real shame.If I were Ann and Nancy, I would re-record almost every tune on this collection with their touring band. Heart is at the top of the musical power, why leave this great material to historical novelty?"
5,Excellent Collection And Rock Band!,"Although I prefer the earlier Heart recordings such as ""Magic Man"", ""Barracuda"",..., this is a great collection of hits and is done right. The sound quality is superb; the packaging is good. This time period is Heart's rebirth on the Capitol label after having legal problems with their other labels. Hopefully, Heart will be inducted in the Rock 'n' Roll Hall Of Fame in the near future."
5,"Great Music, Great Songs","This album captures Heart's pop music peak of the mid 80's into the early 90's. Of course, they had already had success in the rock field. This album features their biggest pop hits and it's a great collection. It features an impressive eight top 10 hits and 12 top 40 singles. The two #1's are my personal favorites and those are the incredible ""These Dreams"" and the powerhouse ""Alone."" ""Alone"" to this day reminds one of my favorite songs. It's unforgetable and an 80's power-ballad classic. Other highlights include the opening track ""What About Love,"" ""There's the Girl,"" and the huge but contreversial hit ""All I Wanna Do Is Make Love To You."" Even the Robert Zander/ Ann Wilson duet ""Surrender To Me"" is present which was a top 10 hit.This album is a definite must-have. These girls had some great songs and great pipes to back them up."
5,Hooked on Heart,"My roommate got me hooked on Heart's rock music. I was surprised at how many songs on this album I knew just from radio play when I was younger. The Wilson sisters have a vocal blend unparalleled in any musical genre. From the power ballads like These Dreams to the controversial, yet gripping, All I Wanna Do Is Make Love To You, the sounds and lyrics of Heart's music resound. My favorite song is Will You Be There (In The Morning). When you listen to this song, pay close attention to the background vocals. The high, powerful sounds will give you goose bumps!"
3,Familiar Stranger,"I'm trying to locate a song and I think the title of it is 'Familiar Stranger'. I thought the song was by the groug Heart, but now I am not certain. I can not locate the song. Does anyone have any idea what the title of the song is and who it's by? Some of the lyrics are: ""Familiar stranger-should I know your name-did we meet sometime ago-are you someone I should know."" It came out (or the first time I heard it) sometime in the late 80's, I believe. Can anybody lead me in the right direction? Thanks."
3,GOod but ..,"Have nothing against Heart. The songs in this album are very good pop songs. I just think it's a shame that such talented singers and band waste all their lyrics talking about futile and weary themes as love, love, love, blá, blá, blá .. THis is plain boring."
3,2nd decade rolls on...,"Heart in the 70s is the band that I grew up with and long for, but for those who grew up later, then this album is for you...memories abound."
2,Who Decided on the Song List? (too many left out),"Being a long-time Heart fan, it infuriates me when bands/artists that have been around for awhile (at least 20 yrs) churn out these ""Greatest Hits"" collections that only have half of the good songs from said time period with a bunch of fillers. Who decided the song list for this album, please?!? Where are ""There's the Girl,"" ""Bad Animals"", ""Secret"",""I Love You,"" ""Almost Paradise"" etc.??? Heart has released at least 3 different 'Greatest Hits' albums that I know of, none of which include all of their great songs. So many good songs were omitted from this album that I would NOT recommend it to any die-hard Heart fans. Until Heart comes out with a TRULY cumulative box set (that includes the previously mentioned songs AND ""Sweet Darlin'"" from the early years) this consumer & Heart fan will continue to be disappointed & will probably end up buying all of their old albums on CD anyway. :("
3,half the hits,"Though this is good, as is their early hits collection, there is a MUCH better one out there. It's Greatest Hits 1997 and I believe it's out of print but I can't imagine why because it's far superior to the other two packages and even the new ""Essential"" collection that's out. You may have to find it used, but Hits 1997 is 17 tracks from their entire career with not one weak song. I found it very worth looking for."
4,Heart-Greatest Hits :1985-1995,"I gave 4 stars because I've got other CD's with more popular songs, actually a little disappointed with this one, it is definitely not the greatest."
1,Ummm....No.,"Yeah so I ordered this for the purpose of having a video with Mason Aguirre in it. I got it super fast = great. It wasn't damaged = great. There's one problem though -- they list Mason as one of the top actors in the film and guess what: he's not even in it!Yeah I was pissed.So now I'm out $22 that I can't afford to waste. The video's music is pretty lame, but I suppose it's alright if you want a snowboarding DVD to try to see if you see anything new??, but if you found it by doing a search for Mason stuff, don't waste your money like I did."
5,Look no further.,"I purchased the first edition of ""My iMac"" and found it useful even though it was no longer fully applicable to the 2nd generation of iMac computers. With the appearance of a 3rd generation of iMacs in the summer of 2000 and with OS X on the near horizon, this 2nd edition, released Dec. 16, 2000, is definitely the one and only book worth owning. Not only is it the most current, but the writing style has become more accessible and consumer-oriented than the first. The language is somewhere in between the reassuring, nurturing approach of Robin Williams' ""My Little iMac"" and the hip, irreverent style of David Pogue's ""Dummy"" books. It's clearly organized and could be used as a tutorial if the reader wishes; it's lively without thinking too highly of its humor. The team of authors speak as a single voice and provide some history of the iMac as well as possible future directions while at the same time being eminently practical."
5,Sits next to my Bible.,"What an amazing book. It is written in a style that keeps your interest high. I'm not just reading this great book, I'm studying it. I wish he had written a commentary on all the books of the Bible. A Pastor can put me to sleep but not this book."
4,The Genesis Record,Possibly the best commentary I've ever used. Writen in a way that draws you into the narative and gives insight into the text that makes it easy to teach and apply.
5,Wooo hoooo...,Excellent book. Provides considerations I've not thought of and validates the Holy Bible in ways I previously did not know. I like this book!!!
5,Genesis,"This commentary on Genesis is informative, easy to understand, and gives proof that God's word is true. The book has helped me with my course on Genesis"
3,This book preaches to the converted.,"The author knows his Bible from a predictable fundamentalist/literalist standpoint. Billed as an analysis of Genesis by a scientist, the authors only detailed scientific explanations are largely confined to hydraulic theories underlying the Great Flood. Morris is a hydrologist, according to the jacket blurb. Anyone who's read Genesis knows that the Flood, though seminal, is a small part of the overall action. The author goes out on a limb regarding the provenance and existence of the Nephilim found in chapter six of Genesis. He is not the first to reach these conclusions. Nonetheless his conclusions will serve to confirm the fears of those who see evil spirits as a reality in today's life. There is little advice, at least in this book,on how to deal with such a world view."
2,Analyzing the Genesis Record,"When my instructor told me to read the Genesis Record, I became very excited as I thought I would read about early Phil Collins music. Then I realized, I was actually supposed to read a book by Henry M. Morris. If Biblical scholars were sold at K-Mart, K-Mart would have shelves full of Morris. This guy is an engineer who thinks he can interpret the first and most important book of the Bible. He believes in literal interpretation of the Bible. He takes the big risk of discussing only the obvious passages of the Bible. As if those passages needed interpretation.While many would say, ""Morris allows the Genesis text itself to refute ... stupid theories"", I believe Morris has succeeded only in writing 700 pages of speculation, peppered with biblical passages. Still, there is no reference to Phil Collins."
4,"good optics, long range",This lense was just what I was hopeing for. I needed the 500mm for my wildlife photography and once stopped down a click or two it was very sharp. There are other lenses that are sharp too but they can't touch this price.Very happy with my purchase.Ed
5,Absolutely awesome.,"These stands are absolutely awesome. They look so good, very stable, not expensive, adjustable. What else can one ask for?"
4,Good product for the price,"Solidly built stands considering the price. Although - as other reviews have mentioned - some parts including the top ledge are made from plastic. These stands are best if you drill into the bottom of your speakers, something I didn't wish to do. It's a shame the top of the ledge isn't flat (it's hollow), as this would have allowed me to simply use industrial velcro to hold the speakers in place. Instead I had to cut a platform out of food, secure it to the stand, and then use the velcro to secure the speakers.I really like how the height adjustment works. Simply have someone sit on your sofa, measure the distance from the ground to their ears and use this to determine how many spacers you add/subtract.NOTE: This price is for a pair of speaker stands. In the description it says 1 (and a few people have asked for clarity), so rest assured you don't need to purchase two sets!"
4,More than I wanted to spend but worth it!,The back speakers I have for my setup were not the tiny bookshelf speakers so I was finding it difficult to find stands since most of them are for the smaller ones. Because of this my selection was limited and these were one of the choices but due to the price I wasn't as quick to add to my cart.Once I did though and finally got them I was more than pleased. Assembly was a breeze and the construction quality is exactly what I expected for the price which is near perfect. I like the option of the spacers even though I ended up using all of them and also the ability to fill with sand if needed. Even though I have heavier speakers the design is so sturdy that I didn't need to fill them with sand.To wrap up if you have larger bookshelf speakers and on the fence about spending the money to get these like I was do yourself the favor and go ahead and get them.
2,Not bad but.......,"This was easy to assemble, isn't that noisy and is easy to manuver. It works great on hardfloors but is terrible on carpeting. I have 2 dogs (1 is a collie with real long fur). It just pushed the fur around on carpets if it did anything at all. Then I had to use hose to suck up the small clumps on carpet. We bought this as a quick supplement to the ""real"" vacuum we already have. Its is being returned to the store as we speak. Its unfortunate because its a great little vac on floors...its just the carpet that it really does next to nothing on. If all you have is hardfloors then this would be a great value for the money. If you have carpets then you want to keep looking...its just not going to do the job. :("
3,"Excellent on bare floors, but...","If you're looking for something to handle quick pick-ups on hardwood, ceramic tile, vinyl flooring, etc., this fits the bill. It is quiet, lightweight, easy to maneuver around and under furniture, and very effective on hard surfaces. As other reviewers have mentioned, though, it is essentially useless on carpets and rugs. I've tried it on low-pile, berber, and coir, and it didn't pick up a thing, even after several passes. For bare floors, it's a convenient time saver and beats the old broom and dustpan by a mile, but you'll need a more powerful unit to clean any carpets or rugs you may have."
1,Go try one b4 you bye,"You have to be a very,very short person to get it to pick up stuff on a carpet. The handle needs to be at a very low angle before it operates remotely acceptable on a carpeted floor.The Tool on board isa joke. There is an awkard handle in middle of this device, which is where you hold on to carry this thing around as you use the hose/tool. Thus, you are carrying an awkard 4' machine around with you as you are trying to use a tool to clean the edges around furniture."
1,do not buy if you need it for ANY rugs or carpet,works fine on hardwood floors but is completely useless on any type of carpet.
2,Not very good for anyone with pets,This does not pick up hair very well and is meant for mere surface dust. Stopped working at all after about eight months.
4,great moments in baseball,I enjoyed the book because it contained a story line about history of the players of my generation. It was not negative and did say very good things about the players. very enjoyable reading.
1,DISCONTINUED and MINI DVD'S SOLD OUT,"We've owned this player for a year and have very much enjoyed it! I just picked up a second one on clearance for 29.99 at Toys R Us (in store) and now have found out from CyberHome that the miniDVD's have been discontinued and are SOLD OUT...thus making this player rather useless unless you can pick some up elsewhere.I have had no luck finding them in stock at any of their suggested stores. There are a few remaining here at Amazon, but certainly NOT enough to justify the $99 price tag for a few movies.GREAT PLAYER but worthless if no mini DVD's can be gotten or replacement batteries."
2,Item is not what is shown.,"I recently purchsed these bags and what arrived is not what is pictured. In fact I dont even see anything about it being an ""Allergen"" bag. To be honest I'm not even sure what the brand is. Most of the packaging is in Spanish. My main issue with this purchase is that it is not as described. These bags are not as quality as the bag I am replacing. The construction is very thin and feels sort of cheap. I would hate to have one rip during removal. I suppose this is what I get for trying to save a few bucks. I will be purchsing something else locally."
5,Wonderfull,This book touches everything all at once. A wonderfull story of a teenager dealing with his emotions and his relationship with a grandfather he feels out of touch with. At the same time bringing in a lesson in the Basque culture and how it affected America. This is a great book for adults and teenagers. I hope Mr. Etchart will continue to bring this knowledge to the readers in such wonderful stories for many more years.
4,An awsome and deadly warrior,"This is a tribute biography that covers Gunny Hathcock's entire life. Several of his now legendary missions are covered in detail. This gallant Marine was perhaps the most lethal combat shooter in American military history and yet, he was a gentle, and altogether decent human being. The story of Carlos Hathcock left me with three regrets. I regret that I never met him. I regret that I never served with him on a mission and I regret that he didn't teach me how to shoot. The photo on the very last page is worth ten thousand words."
5,Sniper Heaven,I've been wanting to get this for my husband for awhile. He is a big Carlos Hathcock fan. He wish he could have met him. His dream was and is to be a sniper. Anyone that loves real stories about people in the military would love this book.
4,Damn Good Read...,"Being a recent ""white feather"" ""Hathcock"" fan, this book was excellent. I really appreciated the Large print, easy to follow format and the authors first hand accounts added a taste of originality to the book. As far as the story... It was great. A true Hero in every sense."
1,Pet collar,Poor quality I would Not recommended-buying this product light did not stay on. Virtually NO operating directions for this product
4,"Traditional, Soul Stirring Version of Pass Me Not","I love traditional gospel music. I am young in age, but have an old soul. It is hard to find old hymns that are not sung in a contemporary format. This version of Pass Me Not, Oh Gentle Savior reminds me of how church used to be...it just stirs up my soul when I listen to it."
5,really good time filler,"my kids loved this toy they have made many different shapes and ""inventions"" with this.WHAT A GOOD IDEA..I only wish the price was a bit better..i would love to buy more so they can make more things.Best toy i have seen for ages."
2,Skin Prep,Quick serviceProduct not as good as regular skin wipe Product sealed in envelopes already dry in many cases. While delivery was quick I would not order again because of low quality of product.
5,ACOUSTIC GUITAR 2 DAVID HAMBURGER,"GREAT PRODUCT. RECOMMEND FOR ANY BEGINNER GUITAR PLAYER. FORGET WHAT EVERYONE ELSE IS SAYING, SUCH AS THIS IS MORE LIKE FOR CHILDREN ETC,. THIS WILL GIVE YOU A GREAT FOUNDATION. YOU WILL NOT BURN OUT. EASY, AFFORDABLE. I COULD NOT AFFORD LEARN AND MASTER BY STEVE KRENZ PRICE TAG, WITH TODAYS ECONOMY. I HAVE BEEN PLAYING THE GUITAR CONSISTENTLY FOR 2 YEARS. I HAVE STUDY AND REVIEWED ABOUT ALL THAT IS OUT IN THE GUITAR WORLD. GO FOR THIS!!!!!"
4,The Good Ol' Days,"True short stories of a countrywoman's life - some funny (you might have to be a farmer to appreciate), some philosophical, most family-oriented, but all from a time when life was good, moral, and appreciated - could be today, you decide.Great pick-up book for when you have only have a minute or two to slip in reading time."
2,Warning: Not as Easy as You Think,"This remote comes with 3 different mode buttons at the top. One for TV, one for your cable/satellite receiver and then one for EITHER the VCR or DVD.What this means to you:In order to change the channel on the cable receiver, you need to hit the cable mode button and then hit channel up or down. In order to watch a DVD you will need to change modes again, hit play, then change to the TV mode so you can switch the video inputs and change the volume. Quite annoying since this is supposed to be ""easy"". The play button serves no purpose in any mode other than DVD or VCR. If they really wanted to make things easy, then get rid of the modes. There's nothing more frustrating than watching a non technical person try to play a DVD and they think that the remote is broken because they're not in DVD mode.Most important thing to note: This remote can NOT support a VCR and a DVD player at the same time. They are together as one mode."
3,"touching, funny, sad, real","Krach has written a delightful tale of two Los Angeles teens on the cusp of adulthood and their circle of family and friends. The plot has been detailed by other reviewers, so I will only say that Krach is at his best when he's zeroing in on a fictional town of Los Angeles and exploring how his characters' lives come together and pull apart.I also want to mention that Alyson has caught their errors and is supposingly printing a new copy of the book, if they haven't already."
4,Fun Read,"This was a thoroughly entertaining read. In fact I read it in one evening after work. My only complaint would be that as in most gay fiction, life is too easy and always ends well. I agree that would be the ideal, but it is not always the reality. Regardless of that one downside, I highly recommend this as a fun and energenic novel."
2,A Disappointment,"I really wanted to read this book, and I did try (clearly, since I bought it), but couldn't get past the simplistic writing. The author writes in a passive voice throughout the entire book (for example, things like: ""he was going"" instead of ""he went""; basically there's an unbearable amount of ""was"" on each page, and practically every sentence) and that's just really impossible for me to ignore. I landed on page 8 and couldn't force myself to continue."
1,let's face it: a waste of time.,"Sorry to be the one to say it, but a lot of gay novels are published---and read---just because the subject matter might interest gay men. But mediocrity is a big problem with much writing in this category, and A. Krach's offering is no exception: navel-gazing, self-congratulations and weak prose don't (or shouldn't) constitute a novel. With all the real literature in the world, why put something as simplistic and half-cocked as this out there? Hardly worth the paper it's printed on. Again, sorry."
3,A simple story,"My expectations were not high for this book, which was heavily promoted in several gay magazines.As a huge fan of gay literature (and literature, in general), I read the book in 3-4 sittings.Krach's sense of character is terrific; his story-telling sparse.I wish he had cut back on some of the characters in order to have more ""quality time"" with some of the main characters, but he creates a very surreal feel to a fake town outside of Los Angeles. An anti-OC, for sure.It's good, it's fast -- and it's not going to change your life. Ultimately, I found myself wanting something else to happen. With all of the foreshadowing, one expects something gigantic to happen in Act Three, and, a lot like life, everything just kind of melds together.One nit-picky thing (that has nothing to do with Aaron Krach or his obvious abilities) -- how does Alyson Publications get away with publishing a book FULL of typos, grammatical errors and punctuation mistakes?"
5,Not what you'd expect,"Half-Life is a well-written, concise look at both gay teen and adult life. It's the story of 18-year-old Adam, on the verge of graduation, his best friend, Dart, and how transitions in life can occur suddenly and dramatically--though all can turn out for the best more easily than you might think.Part of the plot is Adam meeting Jeff, a 38-year-old police officer, and their tentative, even burgeoning, romance. While they carefully explore the possibility of getting together, despite high obstacles, Adam's friend Dart looks for love of his own.The teenage dialogue is right on the mark and the love scenes sizzle. This isn't a light-fluff gay romance novel, but a meaningful, thoughtful story of lives that intersect."
3,potential,If I had a nickle for every rapper with potential. He is above average with a low production budget that holds its own. I am a harsh critiqe. However this album is not bad at all. He was close friend of Tupac's as well. PAC IS EVEN ON A HOT TRACK WITH HIM.Music records don't sell anymore so I hope this brotha is changing with the times and technology if he wants to break all the way through.
5,it was a great show!,"i relocate a great deal with work and had the rare (for me) opportunity to see john and tom in concert when they recorded this cd while i was home (wichita) for christmas...i've heard a lot of good music in my travels but john's music continues to be one of my staples...maybe i'm partial cos i loved the show, but i think the cd is great!"
5,I second Music Fan from Ohio!,There's nothing I can add to Music Fan's review - This is a real standout piece of work. I only wish I had been at the concert....But the McCutcheon/Chapin quartet never comes to California. (sniff)
5,One Tree Hill - Season 3,"I love the show, and I love the price I got it for at Amazon so I will definitely continue shopping here. I didn't think shopping on line would be so cost effective!!"
5,Watch it and you are hooked!,If you want to watch something that has it all this season is the one. But you will be hooked and want to watch every season!
5,GREAT,I love One Tree Hill and the third season is my favorite season! I loved it! Awesome show! Awesome season! ;)
2,Rather Disappionting,Well to be quite honest it was sayes (Repackage) and almost all of the discs worked fine however when ever i recived the product rubberbanded to gether i was in shock. Now not that im complaining to much because the product itself played just the rapper it came in i was dissapionted in.
2,2 discs dont work,"two of the discs included in this season skip very much when you try to play them, makes it very hard to watch the whole season."
2,One Tree Hill-The Complete Third Season,"The disks were in very good condition, but two of the disks had the same episodes on them. The disks were returned and two weeks later I am still waiting for a refund."
2,Not happy,When I got the set of dvd it was all new and not used but as I got to watching the dvds when I came across the 4th disc it didnt work. How can you watch a series when a whole disc doesnt work.
5,Even My Husband likes the show,I absolutly think this show is one of the best teenie bopper shows out. My 33yr old husband enjoys this show. Every episode keeps you hanging in suspense. I never can wait till the next one. The season finale is the major cliff hanger at the end of the third season. When everything seems to start going the way you want another wrench gets thrown into the mix. Waiting all summer for the next season to start is horrible.
4,Completely addictive!,"If you like ""guilty pleasure"" teen dramas, this one won't disappoint. It's good enough to make a 7 hour flight seem short!"
4,one tree hill season 3,"this is a great one tree hill season .amazon really helped,i live in ireland and in 4 days they got the product over.i give the product 5 stars and 5 stars for the service."
5,Whats on T.V,My kids started me watching this show One Tree Hill. When lucas got the Fastback Mustang I had to take a double take I had the same color Fastback Mustang when I was in H.S anyways show is creative has good music enjoy watching I have all seasons. If like H.S & little drama some sports (basketball).
1,Carriers fault???,I had no idea who it was the place or carrier but I was not happy. It came well over the date it was suppose to arrive and I sent it back because I got one that sent me one on the arrival date.
3,Loosing the magic.,I love One Tree Hill. Dont get me wrong. In first season you could feel the magic. Everything they go threw you go through with them because youve been there before in you life. Naley you wanna see the kinda nerdy smart girl get the hottest guy in the school. You want Lucas to get back at Dan and say the perfect thing. You were hanging on to his every word when he spoke to him. You hurt for him. How could he not love his own son. The entire first and second season was prefect. You can relate to everyone of the characters on some level. In season three i honestly felt like something was missing. I wanted more and it just never seem to come for me. The story line is fading into a stupid teenage drama and im scared.Story lines are my passion. Its still a good show i just want that feeling back. The magic.
5,Perfect,This was exactly what i was looking for. I have no complaints about this product. It was in excellent condition.
4,Addictive but vapid,"Okay, this is a fun show to watch. But don't expect much more than that. Think a new dawsons."
5,EXCELLENT PRODUCT,The best developer on the market for creating rich-media e-learning applications. Macromedia's user interface makes it easy to create highly interactive rich content. Highly reccommend!
1,Absolutely pitiful,"Macromedia's former hold on the multimedia market has collapsed so rapidly one gets vertigo thinking about it. To think how intuitive and thoughtful their flagship products used to be, its a crying shame to see them left for dead. Authorware is the ultimate example of this. With an interface straight from the early 90s, totally counter intuitive methods (even the basic tutorial has you going back and undoing things that Authorware inflicts on you by default). This is a sad state of affairs indeed. And for the price of this software, its an absolute travesty."
1,Are ya kiddin?,"They have this exact thing, with a ""Rubbermaid"" badge, at Menards for $19.99. Also there is an ""Igloo"" version at Walmart for $19.99, which although different fills the same function. Somebody needs a reality check on the value of the Gatorade brand name."
2,Metal is oxidizing!,"The pan I purchased is very functional but it is not of high quality construction. I have had it only a year, paid the Amazon listed price, and now I find that the inside bottom of the pan is oxidizing and starting to show specks of the iron underneath the stainless steel. This means that now I can only use it for steaming vegetables and will no longer be able to submerge food items in water that touches the inside of the pan; i.e., I can no longer cook rice or soup in it. Very disappointing!"
1,Seems OK but handle is weak.,"First off I don't like the brand name switch. If the product is listed as Innova and I order Innova, I expect to receive Innova not Kinetic. The pan itself is good but the handle connection seems weak. I bought this to replace a pan with a broken handle (after much more than 25 years of use). I don't expect this pan's handle to last long. Hope the warranty service is decent.Update: Six months use and the pan has split down the side. No reason for it I can think of except poor grade stainless. Normal use. Downgraded to 1 star."
3,"New (and average) take on ""First Wives Club""","While working out at a gym, Liz and Joan befriend each other as they commiserate about their ex-husbands. Joan's ex, Ed just decided one day he would rather be married to his much younger associate; Liz's ex, Dennis pulled the rug and salon out from under her and impregnated one of his stylists. The two decide to get even with the spouses first by (unsuccessfully) trying to seduce them, but later determine that it is through the wallet that their cheatin' hearts really lie. And short of taking their money, the best revenge is living and loving well.Becnel has written a novel about embittered wives who come together for a common purpose. Similar in tone to ""The First Wives Club,"" it is a fun but pretty average read. I found myself bored throughout several passages of the book. Another one to get at the library or used book sale."
3,Ingenious Story Overcomes Its Own Terms,"Once you get used to there being two recently-divorced heroines in two different circumstances, this is a story you can't put down. Reminiscent of the films ""The First Wives' Club"" and ""Nine to five,"" this is more ingenious and very engaging in the first person, chick lit format. The repeated use of a certain term derogatory to females, particularly by Joan--who is the more well-heeled of the two--towards her ex's new wife; does however reflect worse on Joan than on her successor. But maybe the subtitle, ""Time wounds all heels"" refers as much to well-heeled women as it does to the usual type of heel. In any case, the expert plotting keeps things moving beyond such unnecessary distractions."
2,stainless steel grapefruit spoons,"I was dissapointed in these spoons. The serrated edge covers over half of the sides of the spoon, making it too sharp and difficult not to hurt your mouth as you eat. The one spoon that I had previously had the serrated edge covered only about 25% of the spoon's side and did not hurt as you ate the fruit. You have to be careful as you eat with these spoons."
4,Every grapefruit should be eaten with a grapefruit spoon!,"This is what I think. Grapefruit spoons are hard to find in a regular store (if you can find them). I shopped all over the place and couldn't find them. I would have given these five stars however, I didn't find the spoons to be ""thick stainless steel"". I found them to be ok. Probably thicker than cheap stainless steel, but not ""rich"" or ""weighty"" feeling. That being said, they work nicely and they come in a package of 6 which is kind of nice. I bought two sets in case I have a grapefruit eating contest and have a lot of people over. Probably not going to happen. However, if I have a few stuffed in the dishwasher, I still have more in the drawer. I also ended up taking one to work and leaving it there.I'd purchase again. They were worth the price."
3,"Useful but only ""ok"" quality","Grapefruit spoons seem to be extinct in stores so I was happy to find them on line. These are ok but definitely not ""thick"" stainless steel. They bend some when using, probably won't last as long as I hoped. I wish they were quality of regular decent priced flatware. They are not. I rate them ""ok"", better than nothing."
4,a lot of sharp edges,"This can be good or bad, the spoon is not like the old serated spoon with four at the top, it is serated all along both sides. The quality is good, as these are hard to find anymore."
5,Great for everyday,I have nice silver grapefruit spoons but I don't want to polish them after every use. These spoons cut through the grapefruit nicely and I don't have as much wasted grapefruit in comparison to using a citrus knife. The blade isn't too sharp so you can use it to eat the grapefruit. This would make a great gift for a grapefruit lover.
2,Grapefruit spoons,The grapefruit spoons only worked some. You still need to cut the sections with a knife first. The fact that the spoons are narrow did help get the sections out and made it easy to loosen the bottom of the sections. Good thing the spoons were not very expensive
3,mediocre quality,"I was disappointed in the quality of the spoons. I thought they would be heavier, but I guess you get what you pay for. They work fine and were delivered promptly, just not great quality."
1,Very thin and flimsy!!!,I must have received a different set of spoons than most people are getting. I ordered from W and P Trading Corporation. The spoons I received are very thin and bend easily. The worst part about them is that the handle is so thin it cuts into your hand when you try to section the grapefruit. Why would the description say Thick??? These are the thinnest spoons I have ever used.
4,Great product for the price,I've had this product for weeks and find it great quality for the price. It is sturdy and works great for my nearly daily grapefruit.
4,spoons,One of the spoons had a stain on the back of the spoon. I could not get the stain off and discarded the spoon. The other spoons were fine.
4,Surprisingly good,"Considering the price, I expected some cheap-quality spoons that would break easily. And while the construction is light, I haven't broken one yet (+3 months of use). So I consider that I got my money's worth on these."
3,Thin metal; easily bent,"These work fine as grapefruit spoons with serrated edges. However, these are not sturdy spoons, and it doesn't take much to bend them."
4,Grapefruit Spoon Purchase,I actually purchased the spoons for a friend and they indicated that they liked the product.
4,Grapefruit spoon review,"My spoons arrived in good condition, and they have served me well. I am happy with my purchase."
4,grapefruit spoons,I had to wait for the spoons to arrive. They look and clean very nicely.Very satisfied with my purchase.
5,Grapefruit spoons work just fine - great invention,"Great design, beautiful instruments and they work for the purpose they were developed for. I am using mine already. Thanks"
3,These spoons are ok.,"I haven't found a truly great grapefruit spoon. These spoons work ok. They are basically a decent quality teaspoon with semi-sharp serrated edges. I was hoping the spoon would be skinnier and and have more of a curve. That being said, they do work better than a normal teaspoon for eating grapefruit."
4,Spoons,These grapefruit spoons work pretty good but not as well as ones my mother used to have. They get the job done.
5,I have reviewed this one via a separate e-mail. .,Please see that e-mail for review. You will live them like I like them and will not regret purchasing them.Cordially...
4,Ridges to deep,Not best or worse grapefruit spoon I've used. My only complaint is that the ridges go back too far (have to careful when eating not to pull the spoon out too fast) and is a bit to wide. Other then that they are sturdy and look good.
5,These Pruners Are The Best,"I use these hand pruners daily from Mid-March through November. They're reliable, fit my hand perfectly (they come in various sizes) and never bind.I highly recommend them."
5,JLU- Final Season,This collection of the final episodes of the Justice League Unlimited episodes made me relive the days of my little childhood watching the SuperFriends.
1,both CDs have the same 6 shows!,"service was great, but there are 2 CDs in the set, and both have the same exact shows on them. Not sure if it's a manufacturer defect, or something to do with the seller."
1,I got a bad copy!,"I got a bad copy! I love the DVD but it was a two disk set and both disks are the same contents, the labels are differnt but the episodes are the same. I didnt get around to watching untill after the return window so I now have to buy a new copy. When I the new copy I'll write another review....."
2,A Pity,"The JL series ends with this season of JLU. The episodes are so short they are barely vignettes. The content, moreover, is inferior to DC's initial offerings. The stories are underdeveloped, forced, and driven by innuendo. Lewdness at times is not even offhand but direct. In ""Far from Home"" Supergirl utters a shockingly sexual idiomatic expression that should not be found in an ""unrated"" release. I am a fan of the series and a long-time comic book collector. I, however, am extremely disappointed in the drastic devolution of the show."
4,Not so good like the season one...,"...but is not bad either. Its directed by a brazilian. Maybe that's why the portuguese in the main menu and in the spoken language. For me, a brazilian, is terrific. Since the Batman animated, I'm a fan of the Warner animations. This one don't let me down."
2,I keep telling myself this ain't happening...,"...but it is! Like some others who bought it a few months back, I found out today (as I only unwarp it today) that the 2 DVDs are of the same content! The eps in Disc 1 are missinng... and this sucks. I've been on a JL marathon today and it gets to this in the very end.Not impressed at all."
3,"...disapointing, yet worth a watch","I have thoroughly enjoyed the DCAU. I might say that Batman TAS is my favorite animated show ever, but since the beginning its been hit or miss. Some episodes are epic while some are lack luster, usually depending on the writer. This whole season, I thought, was lack luster, aside from The Great Brian robbery and Destroyer. It seems they are rushing to establish the arc in this season, but the threat presented by the legion of super villiany never ammounts to what cadmus was in the 3 and 4th seasons. I think you should see this season ifor yourself, but to me none of these episodes have high playback value and I think this season could have been planned better."
5,DC Fans will love this !,"Great episodes, stories and cameos by some of DC's ALL TIME greatest heroes and villains. What's especially cool for comic buffs of the classic DC Universe is that so many previously ignored, underrated and unexploited characters are presented here, all in loving tribute to the history...with exciting, well written new slants. So new fan or old, there's something here for everyone.The Specialcommentary Features didn't interested me as much as I'd hoped, but the episodes stand on their own for greatness. I loved seeing spotlights on Vixen, Grodd, Black Canary, Green Arrow, the Huntress, Red Tornado, Supergirl, Bizarro. There were a few conspicuous omissions (The Joker, Robin, Wonder Girl, Aquaman) but all will be forgiven. After all, we have to look forward to more adventures yet to come.Special recognition to Andrea Romano's consistently excellent voice casting."
2,"Wtf, way too sexual for kids","I know the comic book nerds will get their panties in a bunch, but cartoons are for children, and these are a little too sexual for kids. I really want to show super hero cartoons to my children, they're fun and simple to fantasize about doing good deeds and saving the world blah blah blah, and all that fun stuff. But skimpy outfits with bulges and huge tits falling all over themselves and grasping and groping and French kissing is a not at all appropriate for children. So these are fine for the comic book geeks I guess, but where can a paren get good clean cartoons of super heros that they can comfortably show their children for fun and entertainment? It's not as simple and easy as you would think. Even the old batmans with Adan West had a stint of curvaceous catwomans and batgirls, but they did it with class and respect, show the curves but not the GD cleavage, kids do NOT PROCESS THAT the way adults do, and that's NOT a good thing or in a good way."
5,Great Finally for a great animated series,The Title says at all. I cant wait to buy the first two seasons (justice league - season one and two)
5,JLU - solid,"If you have not seen this series - don't start with JL Unlimited, season 2. Go back and start with Justice League, season 1 - and watch from the beginning.The plots/story lines get deeper, more sophisticated as you get deeper in the series.Good stuff."
2,Would Love To See The Real Product!,"Justice League Unlimited - Season Two (DC Comics Classic Collection)I would love to able to write a review on this product. However, I have purchased this set TWICE and both have been defective. Each set contained two disc 1's! Both times I ordered! Can someone please tell me how to get a set with Disc 1 AND Disc 2 with unduplicated episodes! Apparently no one at Amazon is performing quality control on this item! Thank you."
2,Is this the Justice League?,It seems more like John Stewart and friends. It is a total letdown from all of the previous seasons.
4,Just what I expected!!,"If you have always like anything to do with DC Comics heroes, this is a must to have. I like it and my boys love it."
4,Amazing to over and over,"When I was a kid, every Saturday morning I would get up out bed, make myself a cup of Hot Chocolate with toast and sit and watch Saturday moring Cartoons.Cartoons have come a long way since then.At 48 years old I have still kept up my tradition no matter where I am.This DVD of the Justice League is incredible too watch.The characters, Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman Green Lantern and the Flash still amazing to watch battle their vilains.I Love them so much so, that I have bought all of the seasons, The Batman series, The Superman series and the Super Friends, so now I can watch them without commercials.What a treat.Buddha"
3,"One of the greatest, but short","The new anime and dc shows can't compare to this show, its a shame they ended so quick."
2,Work great when they stay on,The binding on these need improvement. The would be great if they stayed on. I enjoyed using them but kept stepping out of them or leaving one behind. The bindings loosen as you go. Not secure.
4,Thoughts on hope ..,"Series of statements on the conditions of ones life and expectations. Thought provoking, sometimes causing one to nod and say ""yes""."
5,Pensees for our contemporary world,"The first three lines say it all: ""Without a dream/there is no hope./ And so man dreams.""From here and through all 53 of the short poems that make up this beautiful collection, Bruce Kaduk meditates on what being human means in our contemporary world. These are concise, powerful, philosophical, thoughtful, and, in the end, optimistic poems... ""pensees"" for our contemporary world. Reading them helps us to think deeply about ourselves and our world. A spirit of hope runs through this volume, seeking and professing a spiritual connection to everything. A person feels better after reading this volume. More at peace too. Try it."
3,RAREZAS DE MAGMA,"Si Magma es una de tus preferencias musicales, este disco viene a completar la colección que seguramente tienes. No se recomienda que sea éste el primer disco de Magma que escuches, pues contiene temas inéditos que fueron grabados en vivo con distintas calidades de grabación. En esta recopilación encontrarás testimonios muy interesantes, Sowiloi y Om Zanka son excelentes, 100% Magma, con Vander y Top tocándo a tope en una base rítmica poderosa; mientras que los temas restantes proporcionan una visión de distintos momentos del grupo. Gamma Anteria es un buen ejemplo de la fuerza que el grupo desplegaba a sus inicios. En definitiva las piezas no están repetidas en ningún disco de Magma, (excepción de Sowiloi, pero en una versión muy diferente en el concierto de Bruxelas de 1971)."
4,Excellent introduction to Dixieland Jazz Funeral.,"The soulful narration of Milton Batiste combines with the unique style of the Magnificent Seventh's Brass Band to provide the listener with a very enjoyable first-hand account of a typical New Orleans jazz funeral. While a couple of the songs drag on a little longer than perhaps they should, this 70+ minute CD ended before I was ready for it to. It contains an excellent rendition of Just a Closer Walk With Thee in a funeral-dirge style. I would highly recommend this CD to any fan of dixieland music!"
3,Lawdy This Is Good Music!,"What can match the experience of sitting down at the Cafe du Monde to a plate of beingets lightly dusted with white powdered sugar and a cup of black, black coffee made with chicory?New Orleans is a state of mind. And, part of that experience is honest to goodness, get down Dixie Land jazz.This is a wonderful cd that brings a bit of New Orleans along with it.There is only one small criticism. Between songs there is a narrator who explains the different parts of a jazz funeral. The description would have been better written on the cover.But that is a minimal criticism. The music is wonderful. It makes feet tap. It plants tunes in the brain that the listner will hum for many days.The Dixie Land jazz on this cd is loaded higher than a muffelleta. And the music isn't fattening!"
2,Authentic New Orleans Jazz Funeral,"While the music met expectations, the commentary between cuts was intrusive. These should have been put in the album notes. The one tune I really wanted to hear had commentary all through it. I am sorry I purchased the CD."
5,Very Happy with purchase,"Hi,Thanks for sending me this item. I am vary happy with purchase. and am delighted to recommend this seller to any one.Thanks again.Jayson"
3,"Readable, but a bit lacking","I was in college when the Falklands war broke out and never really understood what actually happened and why.I bought ""The Battle for the Falklands"" as a way of finding out and whilst this book is easy to read and well written I found it lacked a certain personnel perspective. I researched other titles and ended up seeking out ""9 battles to Stanley"" by Nicholas Van De Bijl.This told me more of what I wanted to know in terms of how hard both sides had actually fought and the reality of battle. It showed, in several cases, how close the British forces came to defeat and that ultimately victory was a result of superior training, ability and a certain amount of luck. Despite the rhetoric the Argentineans certainly weren't a walk over and although this book only deals with the land base forces I think it is more realistic and informative.It certainly helped me understand the sacrifices each side made and the futility of war."
5,A comprehensive account of Great Britains last colonial war,"This book is truly the full account of the falklands conflict. It charts the history of the islands, from the initial discovery, to the lives lost in its defence. Being British, I did not find it looking for patriotic sympathy. Neither does the author force an opinion on the ethics of war. The fact thet Max Hastings was on the islands, with the troops only adds to the authenticity of the book."
3,good for what it is,"sometimes moves too fast to get full idea of moves needed, but good for the this type of how to thing"
3,They really mean wimps,"Well done and a great introduction to yoga, but it is truly for the wimpiest of the wimps. If you are in any kind of shape at all you might want to consider something a little more strenuous."
2,Moves too quickly,The instructor in this video moves through poses way too quickly to gain any flexibility through them or to even understand what you should be doing in the pose. Moving through the stretches so quickly without getting deep into any of them was frustrating.
3,Only one workout,"I'm not so thrilled with this dvd. Why is there only one 30 min workout on it? It's so basic and such a tiny sample of what yoga is.The good thing about it is that even if you are very stiff (like me) you can do everything she shows you. There are 2 people doing all the moves - the super flexible rubber lady and the lady on the raised platform showing the modified version of ""rubber lady's"" moves.I just think that a beginner's dvd on yoga should be more thorough like ""Yoga for Inflexible People"" which is FULL of workouts for each part of your body.I have the book called ""Yoga for Wimps"" which is excellent, but this dvd is substandard and nothing like the book!"
1,Destructive to Creativity,"I enjoyed the quotes, but this book is filled with artist bashing through and through, continually harping on the mental fragility of artists, their inability to get along with others, or participate in mutually supportive communities. The exercises promote feeling guilty and insecure about seeing the world in unusual ways and imply that curtailing creativity will lead to better adjustment. The last chapter actually gives advice to the artist about how to make a transition out of a life in the arts. UNBELIEVABLE! The organization ""Artists for a Better Image"" has a web site that lists negative stereotypes of artists in the media. The author parrots these stereotypes hook, line, and sinker. The book ""Art & Fear"" by David Bayles and Ted Orland is much, much better as a guide to an artist's self-understanding. ""A Life in the Arts"" by Eric Maisel is a good book for artists, especially aspiring artists, to avoid."
5,A Life in the Arts,"Alife in the Arts - what THE ROAD LESS TRAVLED was to seekers, this book is to artists-is,quite simply,for me. The Difinitive book on the full range of issues for anyone in the arts. It is a book that one can go back to at any point in one's journey, and glean something new."
2,Doesnt work for medium size insects-they just walk right thru it,"I seem to have develop a new roach problem recently, so got this based on the ""fantastic"" reviews and price. It seems to have only caught small bugs like silver fish or 1/4 inch spiders. One day i saw a spider crawling around; i put the box in front of it and it didnt go in at first and turned around. Then i moved the box again in its path and it ran right through it! So much for a trap... its more like a walk in a park with some sticky puddle of goob for these critters.I had good luck with using Roach Motel a long time ago. Will try it again."
1,Totally useless and attract more!!!,I used this for a week and noticed there are more and more cockroaches in my kitchen. The bait only trap very few and most of them choose to avoid the bait.Also the patent is pending which disappoint me more and justify its 'effects'.
1,Of no use,"It's been placed in various places throughout the house almost a month and has not trapped even one spider. Save your money, it's useless."
1,Where are the spiders?,"Disappointing. I put out 12 traps in my garage, which has hundreds of spiders. After two weeks, only a single spider was in a trap. He could easily have crawled in there by accident. I had to break some webs to pick up the traps to look inside."
5,"Great idea!, great results!","I love simple solutions and this is one. As the night temperatures drop, more and more spiders and crickets can be found exploring my furnished basement. I set out these traps one week ago and the capture rate was high the first two days but almost none the last two. That is how I spell success."
2,Super cockroaches sneer at it,"I found evidence that my pet cockroach, the one that runs at me, not away from me, actually entered the trap and then left it. I think this is the same idea as what used to be called fly paper, only this stuff isn't strong enough.Recommendation: Make stronger stickum in the traps, or be accused of evolving stronger cockroaches."
1,Ants just go around,"We've put the product in several locations and the ants just seem to mosey on around it. . . Really struggling to find a safe, pet-friendly product to help us. Just hasn't happened yet. . . . NOT ONE single ant has gone in to the house. Just sayin'"
5,"Traps full size American cockroaches, nymphs, spiders and flies","One reviewer stated that these don't work with full size adult roaches, however I've captured three using these traps. I was also surprised to discover that these work great to control small fruit flies, coffin flies, and gnats. The key is to always place them along the wall or in corners. Theyre good to place behind furniture and especially near electrical outlets, as these are the most common paths that insects take when navigating through your home. If you catch nothing at all, move the traps to other areas around the house and try again. They're cheap enough that you should buy more than you think you'll need and then place a couple in each room. Keep in mind that the more you place strategically around the more likely you'll trap insect that treads close enough to catch the scent and investigate. Good luck!"
2,Not impressed!!,"Bought this thing out of curiosity to tackle some roach problem but ended up regretting it. No roaches entered the boxes for a whole week (checked everyday) despite the ""pheromone formula"". It did however start trapping roaches after I added some ""bait"" (Doritos crumbs). So don't expect it to attract roaches on its own. I gave it 2 stars cos it does work when there's something inside attracting the roaches but I found something similar at my local 99c store that worked just as well."
1,doesn't work,"roaches dance around the product.. none go into it..now I can see increasing number of roaches (especially baby roaches) around my kitchen, cabinet.. and bathrooms.. (regardless of me cleaning everything). :( the product is still empty.. don't work."
1,Not impressed.,"We have a problem with centipedes and cave crickets in the basement. I set these traps out for a few weeks, and they barely caught anything. A couple tiny spiders and maybe one cave cricket. I had much better success with the large flat glue boards. The ones that look like mouse traps, but for insects. The ""pheromone"" on these Victor traps does not seem to attract anything. So I would recommend using the bigger flat boards."
1,waste of money,this product is a COMPLETE waste of money i have put them in several areas of high spider activity have not caught a single spider. i hate when a product promises so much and it is false.sorry i didnt save box i would send back to this company.
1,"Yeah, right!","In response to the reviewer who said this product attracts insects from all over. I have a good selection of insects in my house, from ants to flies to roaches, silverfish etc. I'm not overrun with any of them (or I would call an exterminator). I have had a couple of these 'baits' set out for a month or two and have not a single insect of any size caught in either one.Either they forgot to put attractant in mine or it's all BS."
1,WHAT WAS THIS?!,IT WAS NOT WHAT I EXPECTED AS U HAVE TO PUT THEM IN CORNERS AND BEHIND THINGS WHERE U HAVE THE LUXURY OF VIEWING WHAT EVER IT TRAPS AND THEN U MUST DISCARD IT...I THOUGHT THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN COVERED SO AS TO NOT TEMPT CHILDREN MORE BY WONDER WHAT IT IS OR...BY SCAREING THEM TO DEATH BY SEEING THE INSECT...HAD A TERRIBLE CRICKET PROBLEM IN MY OLD HOME...AND I WAS BETTER OFF SPRAYING THE OUTSIDE OF THE HOME INCLUDING WINDOWS AND DOORS WHICH KEPT THEM AT BAY DURING THE WARMEST TIMES OF THE YEAR....
2,Really disappointed with it,Received the product in a timely manner but was very disappointed with it once I opened it. It was all gooey. I suspect that it was all the adhesive that was inside the trap. Now it was all over the traps and my fingers. It created a mess! Had to use turpentine to remove the goop. I don't know if I can even use the product because of the mess it's in.I DO NOT RECOMMEND IT.
1,The adhesive used to catch the insert migrated from the interior of the trap to the exterior of the trap,"I ordered two packages of the Victor M256 poison free insect magnet traps to catch some insects that had invaded my home. When I opened the plastic wrapping, the adhesive from the interior of the trap migrated to the exterior of the trap and created a mess when I unwrapped the traps. The adhesive is this product is extremely sticky and while I should have returned the product for a refund, I was thankful to get the traps into a garbage bag without contaminating the house with the sticky adhesive.I like the concept of a glue trap that is poison free, but these traps were unusable before I opened the package."
2,Not for large cockroaches,I bought these hoping to trap the occasional in home cockroach (ours are quite large) but they're nowhere sticky enough to trap a large one. I managed to chase one directly into a trap and it took but 10 seconds to work its way right back out - and another one that I placed moved about 3 inches from where it was but had nothing in it. These will probably work fine if your bugs are small but don't count on it to do anything with the big ones.
5,snugs easy in a corner and hides bugs well,The Victor M256 Poison-Free Insect Magnet Traps snug easily in corners and unlike many insect traps hides the trapped bugs so you do not see the ugly dead bugs easily.The combo of hiding dead trap bugs and easy to put in corners and tight places and trapping the bugs effectively makes the Victor M256 Poison Free Insect Magnet Traps a 5 star product.
1,insect magnet my a$$,this product does nothing. its just a small box with something sticky in middle. i've placed it around my kitchen and bedroom for roachs n centipede. its been about a month and they have caught NOTHING! i've relocated some and still NOTHING! the only one that did catch something is the one that i placed a small piece of food in.DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT
5,Great Product.,Catches everything from crickets to spiders. Love coming and knowing the peace of mind that the bugs caught are not crawling somewhere else I don't want them!! Great product and I order this on a regular basis.
4,"Good, but an incomplete solution","The product is very effective for what it does and easy to use, but it will not cure a roach problem, only reduce it. I think it should be used with something else to take care of the source of the problem."
1,Does not work at all!,"I have ants and cockroaches in my kitchen, and this box does not trap any single insect at all!Really disappointed."
1,Does not work for crickets,The crickets just keep chirping away but don't go in the box. Neither does anything else for that matter. Save your money.
1,not worth it,"The ""glue"" melted during storage and the traps were all stuck together. Could pull them apart but they were all sticky."
2,Didnt work,"The ants and the scorpions I bought these for both avoided it. They were completely useless. Too bad, I really wanted a poison-free solution."
5,Awsome traps,"I use these traps continually in the house, and it's amazing how many insects make their way into these little boxes to get stuck. I highly recommend them."
4,Good for small insects,"If there was more glue on the inside of the little boxes and the boxes bigger, I would have rated this higher. This device is wonderful for small insects but the big water bugs seem undeterred by walking through it. However, I did see some appendages left when throwing away a box. I do like the device and have found the remains of many small insects with in the boxes. I will buy more, but also continue to have the sonic bug repellant along side."
5,Traps Work as Advertised,"I'll make this short - these traps work exactly as advertised. Easy to assemble and place, and they simply fill up with bugs - no mess, etc... Great product for intended use."
1,All Bibles Are Not Created Equal,"I'm a college student studying web development and internet graphic design, and based on the quality of another ""Bible"" book I had recently purchased, the Photoshop 6 Bible - Gold Edition, I jumped at the Flash 5 Bible as soon as I saw it available. This book has turned out to be one of the worst instructional books I've ever read. The numerous grammar mistakes are bad enough, but the exercises themselves are full of mistakes, like this book was rushed straight past the editor and out the door. In one exercise, they refer to a movie clip, but fail to mention which movie clip in the library they're talking about! The Flash 5 Bible is a complete waste of time and money."
1,...just like reading Flash.kit tutorials,"If you have some basic knowledge of Flash, you may skip this book.Action scripting part is fairly god, but thats all.This book is only for begginers, and I mean apsolute begginers :)"
2,**DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK**,"While there are some useful sections in this book for ++beginners++, if you are looking to use this as a serious resource for mastering ActionScript and other professional-level features of Flash 5, DO NOT buy this book.IT IS FULL OF MISTAKES!!!The author has even setup a Web site to address these mistakes but it seems he hasn't discovered all of them yet. I spent almost [price] for this book, because I live outside the U.S. I really needed it to be accurate because I use Flash for work purposes. So save yourself the trouble and look for something accurate."
3,Anemic accompanying Web site,"One of the first reviews on this book stated that the accompanying Web site was still not finished on 2-18-01. Well, it's 8-12-01 and it's still as anemic as ever."
5,Good Or Bad - I think is GOOD!,"Well, I have just bought this book. When I saw other's review, I was quite shock despite the fact that I haven't opened the book yet. However, as an experienced person in this stream, I am quite satisfied of the contents. I say it's a MUST for all beginners and experts. it's a good reference book although I agree that there are some mistakes done. But, Keep this in mind, everyone makes mistakes. In terms of price wise, I recommend this book as it is a great BARGAIN! If you know any other beter books, TELL ME! I sure did be greatfull if you share your opinions with me.SO, OVERALL, I HIGHLY RECOMEND THIS BOOK. IT'S PRICE IS REASONABLE AND I RATE ITS CONTENTS AS 10/10."
3,Rushed to the press?,"This book has a alot of detailed info but they must have been in a hurry to get it printed. It's got a ton of typos - missing words, extra words. It makes for a little extra work gleaning the information."
3,Only average,"This book is a good overall learning tool if you know nothing about Flash. However, if you have read some of the help files and done the lessons inside the Flash help menu you can skip about 40% of this book. If you want every little detail (including common sense) spelled out for you, you'll love this book. If you want to get to get the most out of Flash without days of slow moving rhetoric, then get something else!"
5,under-appreciated master,"This album is great. I don't know why this guy is not more well-known than he is, possibly because he lived in LA, rather than NYC. Any fan of bebop and hard bop should listen to this album and also ""The Fox"". Both are great albums that I listed to regularly. Also, you gotta love the picture of him playing in front of the Watts Towers!"
3,jewelry lover,"These earrings look really cute, but they are so light weight that the hook is allways slipping out of my ear and falling on the floor,ground, etc. They need to have some way to make the hook stay in your ear."
5,Emminence Breakdown,Great CD if you have a passion for native Ozarks fiddling. I especially enjoyed the monologue.
5,Converter box remote,I bought this to replace the remote from the magnavox digital converter box. It worked perfectly within two minutes of opening it.
4,Perfect for my old RCA bedroom TV,"I needed to replace a lost RCA remote, so I bought two of these. The price was awesome, both were purchased and delivered for less than $10. It worked right out of the plastic packaging. The remote's size is a little smaller, but that is actually preferable for the bedroom TV. My only complaint is that the number buttons could be a little bigger in diameter -they feel flimsy."
1,Don't waste your money-Stick with your remote's the work with the unit!,"This is waste money, I have wasted lot money on reversal remote and they work for a while they give out. this remote I couldn't program it to my Toshiba DVD Recorder because the code was to new. Stick with the unit remote then adding these remotes."
3,Doesn't match,"The item delivered was not the item pictured. The remote in the photo is much bigger (in person) and has different colored buttons. I wanted the one in the photo to replace the one I had that crapped out, but the remote they sent was not the same. Much smaller and a different configuration of buttons. I'm sure it's a nice remote, and does all the things that the other one does, but way too small for our use. Returning was absolutely effortless, no problems there."
4,Two Thumbs Up!,"I've had several of these remotes for years, and I think they're just great. They're inexpensive, handy sized, versatile, and easy to use. The instructions are easy to follow, and there's nothing difficult about their set up or operation. I actually have four of them scattered around my living room, so there's always one close by, and I rarely use the original remotes that came with my TV, VCR, or cable box any more. After several years of regular use, I've found that some of the buttons have started to become unreliable, but that's par for most remote controls that you're likely to find. So for a few dollars each, they're easily replaced. In fact, I recently bought several more, but this is the first time I've had to replace any of them. For me, these remotes are just perfect, and I'd recommend them without hesitation."
1,will not operate dvd recorder,"could not program it to operate a Magnavox dvd recorder. it will turn it on, but nothing else works for the unit"
5,Exactly what I wanted,"I have a old remote RCA just like this one and went to several stores looking for another one. Was unable to find and then went on line to find this one. Because this style has been replaced by ""better"" ones I was delighted to find the old model which I am familiar with and can use without looking and searching for the correct buttons. When this one wears out I hope to be able to find another but don't have to much faith.thanks"
4,RCA Remote,"The remote worked well. Buttons and symbols are a bit small and somewhat difficult to read, but that depends on your eyesight.The remote is ""universal"" and has codes to fit with my Memorex Flatscreen TV. Well worth the minimal cost."
1,DIED AFTER 3 DAYS.,"I loved it the first day,used it two more times and it totally died.won't light up or do anything and I changed the batteries several times tomake sure the batteries were good.I ordered another remote and it is working fine,so far---only used it twice."
1,Disappointed,"I was somewhat disappointed in this product due to the fact that it doesn't work with combo devices. In my instance, I have an old TV/VCR combo. I noticed on my sheet of codes that it didn't offer any codes for combo devices. Then I contacted the manufacturer and they said they don't support combo devices with this remote. Which I would not mind IF they stated on the product description what devices they actually do support and don't support. The attitude of their customer support is that even though their packaging didn't say what type of devices they supported it didn't say that they did support combos. Which is just double talk for saying we screwed you and there is nothing you can do about it. Sigh....RCA won't ever be getting any more of my money."
1,"Problem with Fiskars hose ""Leakproof????"" End","I am having the same problem as other folks who have posted reviews. The orange connector popped off and will not stay on. I also have discovered that the male end left behind is a different size and cannot attach the hose to sprayers.The hose itself is good and I like the construction except for the ""leakproof??????"" connector.I am going to replace that end with a male 5/8"" hose repair kit so I do not have to discard the hose."
1,"""Leak-Proof"" is a lie!","The orange male connector leaks and comes off. You can force it back on, but it still leaks and comes off easily. Avoid this faulty product. It is junk."
1,The worst garden hose I bought,"I am trying to find a way to get my refund as well - bought 2 of these and both popped off the orange silly connector - very bad design - not to mention the thousands of gallons water I lost (while the connector remiained popped off) - Please DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT and save yourself the agony. Unless, I get my full money back I HAVE MADE A PERSONAL DECISION NOT TO BUY OR RECOMMEND ANY FISKARS PRODUCTS - If anyone has a way to get a refund without the receipt - please let me know. By the way, the useless pipe is now being used as a rubber rope to straighten a tree in my yard !!"
2,not worth the $$$$,"I agree with the previous reviewer.... the product did, in fact, work fine and not leak UNTIL the orange end popped off from the hose. It will not reattach AND no attachments will fit the hose without the orange end. How convenient for the manufacturer. I, too, will be checking into their warranty for a refund or replacement. I purchased mine at The Home Depot."
3,Faulty Design,"This hose worked fine for less than a full year, but then the ""crush proof"" male coupling popped off the hose and will not go back on properly (water leaks when the hose is connected to a sprayer and water is running). Unfortunately, you need the plastic coupling b/c the hose itself is not threaded (metal end fits into plastic coupling. Will be contacting Fiskars to check into the lifetime warranty. Not sure if this problem is widespread, but it sure seems like a sloppy design problem."
4,Wonderful music that will appeal to all tastes.,"The song selection for this CD is wonderful. All four musicians are stars in their own right, but putting them together with some great music creates a work of art! It's ""bluegrassy"" without the twang of the real old Nashville stuff. Nothing is overdone. Smooth instrumentals, tight harmonies, and solid songs that each tell a story fill the entire CD. I wouldn't try to classify this body of work as bluegrass, folk, western, country, etc. It's just great music played with care by four guys who know their way around a fretboard. My only question is, ""When will I see 'Out of the Woodwork II'?"""
5,AdkBook,"This books is the previous release (there is a more current edition) but absolutely still valid. The maps and trail head locations and info have not changed. Also, this version is smaller (but thicker) than the current version making packing it easier. Recommended."
5,The 2099 series is AWESOME!,"John Peel's furtive writing skills allow him to succeed in writing children's science fiction like no author. ""Revolution"" is a follow-up to his 3rd book, ""Traitor,"" focused mainly on Genia and Tristan. ""Revolution"" reveals some of the secrets about Quietus, the hacker's mafia of the future, as well as the cloning of Tristan and Devon. This is a great book and I can't wait to collect the rest of the series! (BTW, I'm 13 years old, and that seems like a perfect age to be able to understand all of the book)"
5,My favorite...,"One of my absolute favorites for relaxing and thinking through life. I have heard my share of cheesy relaxing music. This cd is not the same. It is filled with soft melancholy piano music with thunder,rain and birdsong in the background. I have had it for over 6 years and still love listening to it."
4,Best Gospel of New Orleans CD,I ordered this because I wanted to hear a particular song that my grandfather use to sing a lot. There were several that reminded me of my childhood. It was good it served its' purpose.
4,Full of Practical Ideas,"As a professional organizer, I have read quite a few books on organizing. This book was very light and easy to read, which I liked. In addition, it has practical ideas for using inexpensive (and sometimes free) storage containers. Many people are on a tight budget, but with the suggestions made in this book, you can find the products inexpensively and at your convenience.If you don't want to read this book cover-to-cover, there is an index in the back that can be used to find solutions to a problem area you want to tackle.I'd recommend this book as a resource for tackling each room in your home."
5,This book has changed my life!,"This book is so motivational. I come from a long line of keepers, but feel I am on the road to recovery. I have been through my entire house with the help of this wonderful book and made vast improvements. I no longer feel guilty about tossing the things that only have sentimental value and are other wise useless. Like the Author says,""Keep the love and get rid of the symbol"". I was literally becoming depressed with the state of my house and unable to tackle it. She gives you the tools and knowledge you need to approach it without being overwhelmed. I feel so much better about my home and possessions. The key is everything has to have a well-defined place so that everyone knows where it belongs. And you need to go though things periodically and not let it get out of hand. Her storage tips are so wonderful and organizing is very important. I am so grateful for the help this book provides. I am giving this book as gifts to family and friends. Nancy Ansel"
1,i should have known...,"by the price, the look, the description, and most of all by the advertisements listed on the cover and elsewhere for numerous ~1001 hints~ types of books that this would be a waste of money. time to rack another one up as a learning experience.this book can be summed up in a few words, and many less pages than the 212 you would end up paying for: kitty litter trays, dishpans in ""designer"" colors, ice cube bins, drawer dividers, cup hooks, shelving units made of boards'n'bricks, and a calendar-style planner.ponder deeply the implications of using those items in your life, and save the $10.00 you would have spent to learn ""the secrets of uncluttering your home"" from this book. it may sound as if i'm spoiling the ending for you, but as far as i can tell none of those items has been a secret for the last half-a-century."
3,Lots of good ideas but no unifying vision,"How much time must we really spend on these details? You can eliminated the need for some of this author's beloved organizing-of mail, toys, and clothes, for example-with a book called Ergonomic Living which provides a fascinating new approach to the home and office. I bought both books."
1,Can't have this book in my house no matter how messy it is.,"I didn't finish reading the book; I stopped at page 2. In this page, the author talked about how one could learn to like doing house cleaning by saying that ""So, you spend most of your life studying rapid eye movement or maybe you specialize in Asian drug smugglers."" As an Asian I felt deeply offended. My house may be messy, but it's far better than having racist material as such lying around. I will return the book."
3,"Books are helpful, but ""Martha Stewart-ish""","This book did give me lots of ideas on organizing and different ways to clean things. But her books have checklists on things like cleaning cords (phone, appliance, etc.) and dusting plant leaves, along with special sponges for cleaning the inside of washing machines. Frankly, I don't have the time or the inclination to worry about this stuff. With an active toddler, an extended family, and two jobs, I worry about whether my house is neat enough to have people over, or making sure there's food in the fridge and clean clothes in the drawer. She's got some great ideas, but she spends too much time on minutiae to really keep my attention. Her books are best suited to those who consider cleaning an art form and a way of life -- not just something to help you keep your sanity!"
5,A book worth buying,"I highly recommend this book. It's enjoyable to read, and her ideas are practical and useful. I have gone back and referred to it many times."
4,opera / poem - Dali / Wakhevitch,"Etre Dieu: (""Being God"") is an opera/poem written by Spanish painter Salvador Dalí with music by French musician Igor Wakhevitch."
4,flaming expose!,Is psychiatry nothing more than a stab in the dark? Will we allow our minds to be so taken over by money that pharmaceuticals can pull the wig over our eyes even better than the media themselves? Whitaker lays it out plan and simple for all to see. It's time to stop the chemical lobotomies and find out what can really help the insane. One draw back to the book is the constant reference to schizophrenia but almost total lack of reference to other mental illnesses.
5,An objective history of mental illness,"Mad in America is an objective look at what we call mental illness. The author is a journalist, giving this account objectivity lacking in most books about this subject. It shows how we have dealt with human behavior that confuses us and frightens us, leading to extreme abuse in the name of treatment. David Whitaker goes on to show how this abuse is not just something that happened in the past, but continues today under the guise of pharmacological intervention. He dares to expose the big pharmaceutical companies and their push to sell medications regardless of harm.The medicalization of mental illness continues to increase chronicity and disability. It is time to consider new approaches and this book does a great job in letting us know where we have come from and what it is we need to avoid in a totally new model."
4,eye opening,"While occasionally I felt the conclusions drawn were a bit of a stretch, the overwhelming amount of data provided leaves little doubt about the main premise of the book - the gross dehumanization and misunderstanding of this segment of our population. Even that phrase seems like an understatement. As both a peer and care provider, this has greatly broadened my view of the mental health community."
4,"Mad in America: Bad science, bad medicine, and the enduring mistreatment of the mentally ill","I found this a powerful and well written review of the history of mental health treatment over the past 200 years. It creates a great overview of the capture of the mental health industry by Big Pharma, and the crowding out of alternative viewpoints. It shows well one of the reasons that prognosis is generally much poorer in developed countries than some developing countries (refer WHO studies). I have sent copies of this book to numerous policy writers locally as Christmas presents. I would recommend it to anyone who finds a sense of truth in the addage that 'anyone who goes to a psychiatrist needs his/her head read'."
4,"jaw-dropping, eye-opening.","Although the historical details can be difficult to muddle through, the message is well-structured. As a social worker in mental health, this book has forever changed (again) the way I will interact and serve clients and their families. Furthermore, whether you work in the field or not, this book will change the way you view humanity and hopefully encourage an appraisal of your values and principles. Whitaker can come across pretty cynical and tends be indirect about his suggestions for improvements leaving plenty of room for the reader to question and develop their own sense of resolution."
1,"Dreading ""Mad in America""","""Mad in America"" is the kind of book that people who have schizophrenia, or know someone who has it, dread. The author, Robert Whitaker, has created the impression that schizophrenia is an untreatable, mysterious, and unknowable disease that modern medicine mistreats. ..."
4,Good history,"Overall, this is a very good book. Whitaker does get rather scientific in parts, but I don't see how he had any way around that. An informative history of the treatment of the mentally ill, specifically those living with schizophrenia."
5,crazy!!!,"I worked in mental health for a state hospital for 16 yrs. This book hit the nail on the head with a sledge hammer. The book is very insightful regarding the history of mental health in this country. This should be manditory reading for anyone wanting to go into this field. After almost 2 decades of working with chronic mentally ill patients,I concluded that society doesn't care about the mentally ill and this book makes that point. I dont want to give anything away so read this one. you wont be disappointed. Well done Mr Whitaker"
5,The best and most important book on mental illness I have ever read,"Shockingly detailed and well researched, this is quite possibly the most important book written to date on the history of the treatment of those suffering with major mental illness.The truth is that those sufferers have been shunned and tortured for centuries, and the treatment in recent times is really not much better. Anyone familiar with the medical model of treatment would admit that medications, on the whole, do not work much better than placebos. Some, such as ritalin and drugs used for bipolar disorder, have done a lot of good, but many if not most simply reduce the energy level of the recipient, causing fewer symptoms by causing less energy and ability to function.Should be read by every American who suffers from or knows someone who suffers from mental illness."
5,Follow the money,I was most surprised how calm the good doctor was in discussing the long period of harassment and fraud comitted against him. Lesser men would have been in ruins. The FDA is a terrorist organization. What do you do with terrorists? You hunt them down and take them out! Brave on good doctor - brave on.
4,FDA should be indicted,"Shows just how petty, dangerous, twisted, greedy, unethical, you name it, the FDA is. Very sickening. Movie could have been made better and the narrator could have been better. I give it 4 stars for getting this to the public so they can see what is really going on with medical care and that actually curing cancer would cause a lot of greedy people to lose money. They have no incentive to cure it. Was a litle one sided would have liked to see more narrative from the FDA's side. Perhaps they declined interviews. The one statement they made in court was grotesquely vague as if they were reaching at straws. The FDA needs to be dismantled and I don't want my tax money going to them."
5,Everyone should watch this,"This is an incredible tale from start to end... but all true. The other reviewers have left in depth commentary, so I won't bother with that. The whole thing can be summarised by the comments of one doctor appearing in the film: ""There is nothing sacred in corporatism but money""."
1,Tough to watch,Selling an unproven cure for cancer to a family who has a loved one that is dying of the disease is as despicable as it is easy. As a medical professional I'm not sure what is more bothersome: that Dr. Burzynski is willing to profit at the expense of the sick or (if the hugely positive reviews of this film are any indication) that the general public chooses to believe a charlatan over the vast body of evidence and expertise of the medical community at large.
5,"Burzynski, the Movie - Cancer Is Serious Business",Finally an in depth review of his work and the challenges he faces. I hope this will give more choices to people who need it.
5,Outrageous!,"It is almost unbelievable what our government has done to this brave doctor. My question is: Why?? This man-of-science should be receiving untold accolades for his work in curing cancer patients, yet he is being persecuted. Again, why??--"
3,Some of this feels a bit like propaganda.,I would recommend you first watch this film (it's not a documentary) on the internet. You can search for it online.
1,Examination of the testimonials,"See [...] for an examination of the medical data, including MRI and pathology reports done prior to the subject treatment. It's interesting that some of the tumors had actually shrunk prior to treatment. The people cured may not have had cancer at all. (Note - the link was deleted by Amazon. See the comments for the link.)"
3,"Burzynski, The Movie","A good documentary of the plight of Dr. Burzynski and his efforts to patent his drug cocktails to cure cancer. Although, that may be the real truth of it, the movie seemed pretty one-sided and the FDA's side wasn't supported by what their motives were. At any rate, it gives you something to think about."
5,The Truth Will Set You Free,"I had heard of Dr. Burzynski's name in the shadows. I had even heard that the Clinical Trials he was involved in were not done according to protocol. But I did not have the big picture of what was happening in his professional life. This film is a chilling allegory for all of us about the power of money and corruption in our country, even at the highest levels of government. Burzynski's treatment of brain cancers and his successes should be known to all so an informed choice about treatment can be made.This film once again demonstrates the power that a documentary can having in shedding light on the truth. A most important film!"
5,We need more people to support him,Every good we need more people to support him i would really like him drug go world wide.This sould spread all around the world
5,I wish we had known about Dr. Burzynski,"My husband died of a brain tumor after 2 horrible years of chemotherapy and radiation, given to him by doctors at Cedars Sinai and U.C.L.A. Medical Centers. He suffered terribly during the treatments and I wish he had had a chance to live, and also received a treatment that was not toxic! Let us all pray for Dr. Burzynski. He has fought the good fight."
5,Cancer Treatment,Every one on Planet Earth should see this documentery film. Why would the Americian Goverment not want Dr. Burzynski to proceed with His cancer treatment discovery?Why would Americian Companys try to pay off certian agencys with the intent of not allowing Dr. Burznski to do his cancer treatment and the the sciencentific trials needed for provement of his treatment.Why hasn't the World been informed of this Cure for some types of Cancer? if not All types.
5,He was right after all!!!!!,"mind blowing subject matter well documented and interestingly laid out. this documentary unfolds at the perfect pace and offers important information for persons considering cancer treatment. perhaps now, costs can come down on these targeted gene therapies. They have been shown to be effective... in orders of magnitude more effective - that run of the mill chemo and radiation, without the side effects of tissue distruction, nausea, weight loss and hair loss. All the best, Dr. Burzynski and congratulations!!!"
3,It is what it is... quality hit but for the price completely acceptable.,"With a new baby and almost unlimited pictures being taken and printed I was looking for a solution to save some money on the prints. I had gotten another cartridge from another company and was happy with it and decided to try these because of the ultra-low cost.The colors seem great print quality is clear but you can really tell the difference between this cartridge and the original when it comes to subtle tones and shades. You'll be able to tell when you run your printer's diagnostic or test print, this cartridge has two settings on and off... very little gray area at all. You get very contrasty pictures (if that is what you are using this for)If you are using this for standard printing, I think it would be great. But if you require those subtle shades for full color prints.. it's OK not great."
2,Ok - could be better,The product doesn't seem to last very long - but I'm not sure there are alternatives
2,Single Cartridge for colors?,"Although users are quite happy with the printer, I would be hesitant with this printer purchase. What happens if you run out of one color? You'd have to buy a whole new color cartridge?"
2,These Color Cartridges do not last long,"Love the print quality, but these do not last long. They go out without warning, nor explanation of problem. I tried to refill them with injected ink kits, no luck. Seems to me that HP puts a code on the catridge so when it is deemed done it is done, regardless if there is sufficient ink in cartridge.I am upset w/ HP over this issue. They block after market competition, supply an overpriced, poor product, and do not offer bulk purchase of replacement cartridges."
1,Technical Details Misleading,"It states in the Technical Details that you can get 450 pictures from this cartridge. This is not true. After much discussion with HP, they finally admitted that it's only rated for 150 4 x 6 pictures. My experience is that you actually get a little under 100 pictures from it. If you're buying this cartridge, you've probably already bought the printer, but you should know before you buy the printer that you're going to go through a lot of expensive ink."
1,Garbage - Do not buy this,"True, this is an original HP cartridge. The problem is that it is not original HP ink. It was refilled who knows how many times, most recently by OfficeMax if you can believe the label. And true, that's probably what you can expect for this price. But even then it should print in all colors, not just cyan. Beware of this seller, who uses words cleverly but whose products are garbage."
1,HP Ink smears,I've not found a current HP printer/ink that you can highlight without it smearing. I don't why this is (and writing HP they will blame your paper or something). Xerox inks do not smear that I've seen.
1,HP Junk,"Printed less than 50 text pages and cartridge error LED on printer started flashing. Had to buy new cartridge, $35 wasted."
4,Printer ink,"Just what I expected, its the standard HP product and does not require a lot of explanation as far a sI am concerned"
5,Best way to order printer ink,"I hate going to the store. It is so easy to sit at my iPad and order my ink. It always comes within a few short days ready to use. Cheaper, too."
5,LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS ONE!,"If you celebrate Christmas, or if you don't but still listen to the music secretly, or if you just love all things New Orleans like I do (especially the music), get this one! Milton Batiste's ""Me Big Fat Santa"" is the standout, but every track is great. Put a little gumbo in your Christmas cheer - it's a whole lot of extra joy!"
5,NBC Western TV Legends - 4,"We purchased the NBC Western TV Legends which included the first episode of 4 TV series, this we found to be of very very good quality and gave us the chance to review the 4 TV shows, we have since purchased or ordered 3 of these sets due to being able to review each show, very satisfied with what we received."
3,Good for forts and fires...,"I was kicking around picking up Cold Steel Kukri machete when this guy showed up including a sheath. I went over to You Tube to check out any reviews, found 2, and went for it. It's OK!Guys are afraid of 440 stainless, but 440c is an acceptable knife steel, and can be quite tough when properly heat treated. I chopped up a small junker tree out back and batoned through a bunch of firewood and the blade held up fine. Couple licks on a steel and it was right back where it started. Factory edge is to abrupt and honed only so-so, but it's a chopper so it's good enough.Finish was applied evenly and held up good through use. Handle is comfortable shape/material. Slight wiggle in handle to tang fit, seems to be getting worse under use, so fit gets a solid D+. I'd buy this thing again, and I'm considering another Smith and Wesson big blade because I'm very happy with the cost/performance ratio. Go ahead and buy it."
1,snapped in two,"I liked this knife until it snapped in half while chopping some tomato vines on a chopping stump. Nothing brutal or so, it simply snapped. I can't recommend it."
3,Cracked and dinged,"The kukri was great for a while. It held up good when I had to go hacking through a mangrove thicket, and stood the test of getting a little saltwater on the blade from working around islands. But I was doing a little yardwork and then the blade snapped clean in two. It seems like this thing is made to break, since I've read several reviews saying the same thing.One more problem I had with it was a factory error near the tip, a small dimple in the steel."
4,Good At What It's Made For,"This knife is great for what it was made to do (ie: remove limbs). The front heavy blade causes the knife to propel forward as soon as the swinging motion is initiated. With a hacking tool, a razor edge isn't desired, and with a proper hacking edge this knife will cleave through just about anything that you need it to (Besides a tree trunk, if you want an axe than buy an axe). The kinetic force generated by this knife is extremely impressive, so make sure that you can control your swing. Overall, this knife is a complete pain in the ass to sharpen, but there are few other machetes that I would rather carry at any price."
5,very pleased indeed,"i received this in a timely manner, and was thrilled with the quality the package was in, as well as the candies inside. although i'm the only one i know how likes this, i'm glad that this treat will last me a good, long while.i will definitely buy more when i've finished this batch."
2,Tastes like a decorative soap,"I can't remember ever having Turkish delight before today, but I bought one of these at a local grocery store because it sounded interesting. The flavor practically made me ill. I like rose flavored things... various confections, gum, cough drops, even vodka... but this, to me, tasted more like a floral-scented decorative soap. The fact that it was covered in chocolate didn't help much. Must be an acquired taste!"
3,Disappointed in the age of the book - I thought I was buying new,"Whilst the service was quick I thought I was buying a new or ""as new"" book at the very least. The book was about 10 years old and the pages were yellowed as a result. Will be more careful next time."
1,Hair Loss,"Kind of shocking? As a first time user when I applied the hair color instantly, I lost almost 700/800 hairs in 5 minutes and my hands were full with lost hairs. I got scared? The color coverage is as good as 65% ?I'm not sure I will ever use it again? Something must be wrong with this product?"
3,Just for Men Real Black,Works ok. A bit messy to apply. Stains easily so be careful spilling it. Does not last that long but enough to get to next cut.
1,Drips and dyes your neck and ears during application,"This product does dye your hair to the color you want.However, the formula is very drippy, despite their ""non-drip"" statement.I have used it multiple times and each time I spend more time trying to get our the stains for my ears and neck when the thing just slides down your hair onto your skin.I would not recommend this product. Get a hair dye with a thicker formula."
3,"Scary, terrifying story for a young child.","The story still gives me chills after reading it a few times. After I explained to him what it was about, my 6 year old asked me to read it to him anyway, and he was so scared he couldn't go to sleep afterward. It is well written, with quality artwork, but I would recommend it for older kids who enjoy ghost stories, rather than young pre-readers. Even with a happy ending, the Banshee legend is a scary, creepy image. A full passenger train being chased to certain death by a reckless runaway passenger train behind it is terrifying beyond words, even if (or especially if) the pursuer turns out to be a spector."
4,A hair-raising tale,"My daughter says that this book ""absolutely creeped me out"" when she was young. Which is saying something, because she read a lot of scary books as a child. And it still makes my scalp crawl just thinking about it sometimes.The late Ted Rose was one of the country's great railroad artists. I originally bought this book for the illustrations, and I was not disappointed. The story itself is good, even though Odds Bodkin's narrative style seems somewhat pedestrian when written down. But Ted Rose's illustrations are superb, even if he had some trouble rendering people.P.S.: I think the red-bearded fireman in the pictures is supposed to be Bodkin himself."
3,GREAT FOR FIRST 2 SEASONS + 3 OF 3RD ONLY,"THIS IS A VERY HELPFUL BOOK BUT ONLY COVERS SEASON 1, 2 AND 1ST 3 EPISODES OF SEASON 3."
5,want to hear more magic from Jack Sheldon? . . .,". . . just take listen to the start of ""Stranger in Paradise"". What you'll hear is a signature trumpet sound that's everybody bit as distinctive and recognizable as that of Miles; Diz; Lee Morgan; Chet Baker - you name 'em. ""Councellation"" is a slighty weird, yet interesting and totally listenable little ditty, with C.C. himself filling in lots of interesting plucking on his bass. The rest of the tunes examplify the perfect balance of tension (east coast) and laidback-ness (west coast) that the Curtis Counce Group captured far better than most. If I had a time machine, I'd walk in on a gig that this bunch were playing in some L.A. dive someplace. But until such a device exists, CDs like this will have to do."
5,and we thought it wasn't coming??,Read a book that will amaze you about the truth that has been known all along!! What were we expecting the way we were going with our money?? Read and find out how it all came to fruition!! Amazing facts!!
4,Great toy bad company,We has the 3-5 day express and paid extra but got it 7 days later. Other then that it is a great bust.
3,Hook meets Star Wars?,"O.k., so what is up with the hook?! I mean I felt like I was re-living Empire Strikes Back, only this time it was another Luke who was losing his hand. Coincidence? Creepy, forced, and a little over-the-top. If you like Kleypas, I would recommend you read 'Someone to Watch Over Me,' or 'Dreaming of You.'"
3,Midnight Angel,"Ms. Kleypas is a superb writer, but I didn't like the characters she created very much. Luke was too closed up for a huge part of the book and Tasia was just too impulsive for her own good.The back cover blurb reads: ""A noblewoman of frail beauty and exotic mystery fakes her own death to escape the gallows. And now she must flee. In disguise and under a false identity, she finds unexpected sanctuary in the arms of a handsome and arrogant yet gallant British lord--who must defy society to keep her safe...and overcome a tragic past to claim her as his own.""S."
1,Forced romance,"This would be a great book if the heroes were just friends and the story centered on Tasia and her fight to overcome her past. But of course, because this is a romance novel there has to be some love. Or should I say there should be some love? Because I never saw it. First the hero ignored the heroine, then made a spectacle of her, then decided that he loved her. Had a mistress, left her one day and jumped in bed with the heroine the next. The love scenes were so forced. They weren't the logical consequence of their relationship. They had no relationship. It was all so forced. Really bad. The hero simply decided that he wanted something and so he went for it, even if the heroine wasn't totally in agreement. It was just so painful to read about them. I don't recommend this book."
3,Not the Good Stuff,"This book and its successor, Prince of Dreams, were the only two Lisa Kleypas books that I was seriously disappointed with. The characters were flat, and as other reviews have mentioned, the plot took an awfully long time to get under way. I found the supporting character of Nikolas more than a little creepy, especially his interest in the pre-adolescent Emma. Yuck. And then he carries that relationship, not well I might add, into the next book? Ewwwww!Lisa Kleypas is capable of much better plots, character development and a sense of humor that I love in her other books. Go read the Bow Street series instead...."
2,Boring & Trite - Lose the Bible Quotes!,"I tried but could not get through this book and quit about halfway through - as much as I like Lisa Kleypas normally, I just couldn't get into the heroine in this book. She's very religious and quotes the bible regularly throughout the novel - not something you expect from an Avon Romance. I think Kleypas tried to make her character reflect the background in which she was brought up - she portrays the culture of Russia at the time as very religious and devout - but it just turned me off. Maybe she comes around and loses the religious piety, but I didn't have the patience to find out. I also was annoyed by the ""borrowed"" plotline at the beginning where she fakes her death by taking a poison that gives her the appearance of death - right out of Romeo and Juliet. I'd try some of her other good novels like 'Dreaming of You' and not waste your time or money on this one."
2,Least favourite,I probably cannot add to the reviews already given. This has been my least favorite of Kleypas' books. She has written many brilliant books so I would have a look at them rather than this one.
3,Just ok,"I am a huge fan of Lisa Kleypas, I have read almost all of her books. Midnight Angel in my opinion is the worst. The problem I had while reading the book was I did not particularly like the main characters. Tasia irritated me at many points, she seemed a bit hypocritical to me. If you would like to read a book by Lisa Kleypas I would suggest, Then Came You or Mine Until Midnight."
3,Somewhat disappointing...,"I have read four of Lisa Kleypas's books so far, not including this one, and all of them have been consistently entertaining, even moving at times. This one, however, drove me up the wall more than once. The behavior of the two main characters compelled me to roll my eyes and let out a sigh of impatience and disgust, not a good sign when you had begun a novel fully intending to be carried away by romantic sentiments. This book is simply not romantic. The heroine fails to raise either interest or sympathy, unless somebody out there *likes* Bible-spouting, oh-I-miss-my-homeland, oh-I-am-so-innocent-and-naive, pretentious young women. And despite the attempts of the author to imply otherwise, the hero comes across as basically someone who wants to get laid, and often. There was no indication at all anywhere that he is capable of restraint, or that he even believes in free choice. Not my kind of man, not my kind of woman, not my kind of love story."
1,Actually stopped reading it!,"Wow. I can't believe that I actually 1)Disliked a Lisa Kleypas book and 2)Hated it so much I stopped reading it. I never felt any sympathy or empathy for the hero. He was a bitter and cruel man, with no redeeming qualities. He was very unpleasant to the heroine, and actually physically threatened her early in the book. Then, after knowing she was hiding from a dangerous past, he forced her to almost expose her background in front of a bunch of strangers. Finally, he did a complete 180 and was suddently fascinated and in love with the much younger heroine (which I also found slightly creepy. Life is way too short to waste on this book. Don't even bother checking it out at the library."
1,The worst Lisa Kleypas novel I've read yet!,"The first Lisa Kleypas novel I read was 'Suddenly You' and that was absolutely wonderful. 'Dreaming of You' was great too. But Midnight Angel was horrible. I strongly advise anyone thinking of reading this book to borrow it from a friend or the library, because it isn't worth paying for. Lisa Kleypas has incrediable talent, but this book did not do her any justice."
2,By far not Lisa Kleypas's best work,"I had high hopes for this book, because it started out well, butI didn't like Tasia at all. In the beginning she showed a bravery, a kind quite spirit with a supposedly religious outlook on life but then she turned into an easy, spoiled, vain, argumentative, shrew. Tasia changed personalities in mid book! And after Luke and Tasia became married, it was worse, wanting separate bedrooms and when one of their arguments was not going her way and she said, I could have this marriage annulled!!! That was it for me, she had become just an immature brat and I couldn't finish the book. I am glad some of you enjoyed this book, but I just don't like spoiled brat heroines."
1,DON'T BUY THIS BOOK!,"I just loved her book ""Someone To Watch Over Me"" so I went out and bought this one. What a huge mistake. I disliked both characters intensely and did not care for the plot. Way too much psychological junk cluttering everything-I got to the point that I had to stop reading the book after I had read about a quarter of it. Save your money and wait for her next book."
1,ANOTHER TURKEY FOR KLEYPAS,"This is another piece of work by Kleypas that I did not enjoy. I rank this book with her ""Prince of Dreams."" The characters were really blah; the hero was an arrogant jerk and she was an absolute ninny. There is no comparison to her other book ""Someone to Watch Over Me."" That was really worth reading and very entertaining."
2,Kleypas' worst novel,"The potential was there, but it never happened. I actually struggled at times to finish it. Why? It was boring...deadly dull.Kleypas writes as though she's trying to cram in everything she's learned about Russia and somehow manage a novel out of it. The characters never really come alive -- the secondary characters, the hero's daughter and the heroine's dangerous cousin, are more engaging than the romantic leads. Plus, I never bought into their feelings for each other. It was a mish-mash that lacked heart and emotional pull.I found myself mentally rolling my eyes or grumbling in annoyance as I'd reread the same phrases over and over throughout the book. And the love scenes? Clinical and uninspiring; worse, they seem to be in there just to be there--they do not flow from the story. Considering there's an overabundance of them, that's very damning.Avoid this book and get one of Lisa's other books; most are excellent, but this one's a dud."
3,Diehard Kleypas fans only,"Hmmm...I found this to be pretty unrefined - it was written 10+ years before her Hathaways or Wallflowers series, which are soo much better!So, unless you're a diehard Kleypas fan and have to read all of her works, is stick to her newer series or contemporary novels."
3,Boring..............,"This book was just really boring. The characters did not capture my interest at all. I took 4 days to read this book. If a book is really good, it only takes me 1. Thats how boring it was. What bothered me the most was that the characters did not really seem to love eachother because of personality reasons, but because of the sexual enjoyment. Their relationship was lustful and lacked a romantic vibe. The characters seemed to fall in love out of nowhere. I found their love to be silly thats way I gave this book a 3. I love lisa K., but this book was ridiculously stupid and had a tendency to put me to sleep. Even worse the heroine, I hated, because she was made out to be so humble in the beginning, but then became materialistic after. I dont know about you, but I dont like conceited people."
3,"TITLE IS MISLEADING UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT ""PARTY PLAN"" IS","This book is for the ""PARTY PLAN"" business, not party planning. I thought that it was a book about how to start your own Party Planning business. I got the book and was disappointed because it is a guide to being a saleswoman. Like Mary Kay, Pampered Chef, etc. It is about merchandising a particular product and trying to teach you how to get bookings. It's not actual Party & Event Planning like I had anticipated. It is good if you are intended to be and Avon, Mary Kay, or Pampered Chef woman but not if you are looking to plan your own Event Planning Business."
1,No way,"This book is not about a party planning business, as the title suggests. It is about selling products via a party plan (Tupperware, Magic chef, et al)The actual market for this book is very limited and even then, most of the parent companies provide most of the information included here in their own training. Not worth the price to much of anybody!"
3,Bush Kids Missing,I loved the book but there is huge omission - there is NO mention of the Bush twins - yet the Obama kids are mentioned and featured on the cover... can someone at AMAZON please help me understand this. I had to tell my kids about the Bush twins - but could not tell them why they were omitted from the book.
5,Great read again and again!,"Adrianne Lee's Endless Fear is one book I have kept year after year - and read it time after time. This is a great book - take the time to read it, you won't be disappointed. Afterwards, pick up a couple more Lee books for your reading enjoyment!"
1,A Total Dissapointment!,"Linnea was actually a bitter woman who uses curses and profanity freely. She is just so full of hatred and contempt that she was almost a hypocrite when charging that her grandmother was a cruel woman! This book makes no sense because in the beginning, Linnea cares about the subjects of Maidenstone, but she is really oblivious to what is going on. She has no sense of judgement, confined to her own self pity and hatred. Not someone I would rather like for a heroine. The more I read, the more I hated her. I have never had such antagonism against a main character of a book before. This is my first and hopes to be my last.Rexanne Becnel should really reevaluate her writing style. She has no logic flow and she is very repetitive when writing about her character's thoughts and emotions. Plot development is slow and emotional description is senseless and boring. I totally do not recommend this book at all. Save yourself the money and buy a better book!"
5,Definitely worth picking up!,"This is the first book I've read by Ms. Becnel, and it certainly won't be the last! When Linnea, the second born of twin girls and supposedly cursed, finds out her sweet twin sister is to marry the man who takes over their castle, she makes a desperate switch and becomes the wife to the man who vowed revenge on their family. Because she is not Beatrix, the marriage is a farce and her family hopes to shame him. Although she sets out to hate him, her body betrays her and, finally, her heart. But when the truth of the deception is revealed, will she be able to hold up under her love's condemnation? Definitely a good romp, and a wonderful story. I'd recommend it to anyone who like medieval romance and strong heroines.Sarah Pearson"
2,Left me cold,"I have a number of Rexanne Becnel's books as keepers. So, I started looking for any that I might have missed. Found this one and 'Heart of the Storm'. This book is surely an abberation and I'm not understanding how it received so many 5 and 4 star reviews.The sad thing is that I could really see potential in 'The Maiden Bride'. I absolutely HATED the the ruby belt as a form of sexual control. The very idea that the heroine could fall madly in love and lust with her captor within two weeks was just too much for me. There was plenty of conflict and lust but not much romance. I would not recommend this book."
5,"Remeber Jo's ""naughty stories?""","In Little Women, remember the stories that Professor Bhaer convinces Jo aren't worthy of her? These stories, written under the pseudonym A.M. Barnard, are sort of those, just as Jo was ""sort of"" Alcott's alter ego... Alcott loved these short stories, considered quite scandalous, and she felt they were better work than the ""moral pap for children"" (her words, not mine) for which she is more famous.While I love Little Women (read it a million times), and am really glad she wrote that ""moral stuff,"" these stories have a darker edge than the happy March home-- thrillingly scandalous. Some of the short stories are a little bit less finely crafted than others, but all of the ones in this collection are fabulous. Actresses! Poisoners! Exotic Locales! Revenge-seeking scorned women! Wicked Women in general! This is one of many collected by Stern-- so get them all, and learn about the darker persona of the famous ""girl's writer."""
5,Behind a Mask: The Unknown Thrillers Of Louisa May Alcott,"Have never read ""Little Women"". Probably never will. But this book is really, really worth reading. Sometimes it was so exciting, yet I did not want to read on because I thought something terrible was going to happen to the heroine. (Perhaps, good stories are suppose to do that.) I enjoyed the phrases and descriptions of items. I am a slow reader; I go back and reread words, phrases, sentences and paragraphs just to enjoy them over again. I enjoy its words and phrasing.The writing of that time 1850 is interesting in itself, the introduction talks about how these unknown works of Louisa May Alcott were found. But if you are going to read this book, skip the introduction until after reading it. It gives away some of the times.This is a book worth reading whether or not you are a Louisa May Alcott reader."
2,"Nope, definitely not for beginners..","Previous reviewers are correct in stating that this is definitely not for beginners. Recently I started doing ""Amira's Bellydance 101"" (absolutely love it) and felt like I had learned a little something. Hehe.. evidently I had not learned as much as I had thought. I could not really keep up with ""Step by Step BellyDance"". After 30 minutes I turned it off. I'm giving it 2 stars because the instructor is very enthusiastic and fun to watch. More experienced dancers might be able to keep up with her. I'm just glad that no one could see inside my living room when I was trying to imitate her movements :)"
2,Beginners need not try,"I thought this would be a great addition to my (admittedly very small) collection of belly dance DVDs. I'm an absolute beginner with absolutely no dance experience. Boy was I wrong. Have I mentioned that I'm an absolute beginner with no dance experience under my belt?There are a few pros to this DVD though. The music is great, and Leilainia is obviously enthusiastic about dancing. She seems to be having a heck of a lot of fun and is plenty encouraging. Leilainia is certainly very engaging and made me want to try, but I just couldn't. Remember when I said I was an absolute beginner? I need a slower pace so I can get it all.I wanted to like this DVD, honest. But I think this one is geared more toward people who have some sort of dance experience behind them, and want to branch out into bellydance. Not for people like me who have never taken a dance class in their lives."
4,"Workout first, Bellydance second.","I enjoyed this video and definitely got a workout. However, it doesn't seem very suitable for beginners, at least not if you don't have dance experience of any type. I would call it a workout that utilizes Bellydance moves. The music is not traditional, nor the routines, but it's fun, upbeat, and you'll get a workout. Instructor is fun, and I think she does drop you some good visual hints throughout about how to hold yourself and keep from straining. You'll probably enjoy it if you're at the intermediate level, or have had enough classes to already be comfortable with the moves--it took me 2 classes just to understand what was happening with the knees in a shimmy!"
5,50 Years In The Church Of Rome,"Was actually delivered much faster, than stated. Very pleased.Thank youSheri"
1,Total Lies and Fiction,Any serious scholar with even a little bit of decent reference material will realize that this book is not only a bunch of lies but completely inaccurate. It should be in the fiction section along with Maria Monk. If you want to know what the Catholic Church is all about then ask a Catholic! It's not like anything about the faith is a secret! This book was obviously self-serving and when he couldn't find facts to make his story shocking he made things up.
5,Catholic priest expose Churches greed and corruption!,"To read first hand knowledge of the early beginnings of the Catholic churches entry into this country is facinating. To see a good priest stand up to his corrupt superiors is one to admire. The chapter dealing with Abraham Lincoln and who was behind his assination is something I never learned up until know. I highly recommend this book, it won't disappoint you!"
5,Greg's poetry Corner,"Greg's poetry Corner is filled with sweet light hearted poetry,along with poems of wisdom and humantian feelings.In this poetry corner you'll find something in your own self perservationand it will provide you with inspiration.It is definately a poetry lovers must read. You'll find yourself smiling as you read poems like ""Made My Day"", ""Salty Sailor"" & ""Make A Wish"".You will find your heart connecting with poems you read like ""Her Eyes"",""She Says"" & ""The Perfect Lady."""
2,Good art & corny story don't hold up well,"John Byrne is always given a lot of credit for revitalizing the Superman universe in the `80s. After reading now the third volume of that task I can't imagine how bad the books were before him if this was considered so good. While I accept the time frame involved Byrne's writing is dreadful and is as with most of the DC Universe, wholly inconsistent. The corniness seems even higher than most other books in the time period. Now his art on the other hand is very good and looks ahead of its time. Reading these older books give you perspective n today's books but there isn't a good deal of actual good storytelling."
5,lexx season one,"This was one of the funniest and best tv shows that has come out in along time, I just loved it."
1,terrible,"as a lover of sci fi, i look for shows that i have missed. I'm glad i didnt spend a lot of money on this first year of the series. after the second episode, i just about through the dvds in the trash. terrible acting. terrible sets. terrible story lines. need i say more? dont waste your' time or money. this should have croaked after one season. i cant see the acting or plot getting any better."
1,Don't Waste Your Time!,"I watched Season 1 and part of 2nd on Netflix. At 1st it was so stupid it was funny, then it just went downhill from there on! It has the worst story line and acting I have ever seen. It is like a semi porno want to be SciFi! Not!!!"
4,"Love Slave and Dweeb and Insects, Oh My!","And did I mention the dead (re-animated) assassin? This dark comedy/sci-fi written by Paul Donovan, Jeffrey Hirschfield and Lex Gigeroff (three men I never want to meet in a dark alley) opens with the death of Kai and spins out of control from there.This ain't no Star Wars. The closest you'll get to Luke Skywalker is an inept security guard.I'll just say ""Zev ain't a princess either"".Nothing really explicit goes on but let's keep this movie hidden from the kids, OK?"
1,Poor quality,Poor video quality and story line. I stop watching the first show after less than five minutes. Don't waste your time.
1,Garbage,"Garbage in__Garbage out..A pathetic offfering for a sc-fi series.Background settings--cartoonish; acting--high-schoolish at best; story plot--boring, no imagination...a total waste of my time."
3,Space Oddity,"This brings back memories. I was an avid follower of the series. It was so very different than anything else. Maybe my memory is far enough removed from it to not notice any edits as another review has mentioned. I watched it on Toronto's City TV as well as Space channel.I just finished watching I Worship His Shadow and clicked over to look at the Chapters part of the menu. Anyone else notice that chapter 7 'Prophesy' as it is spelled in it oddly enough, also seems to host a still not from the show at all. It looks like two guys sitting next to eachother in a bar, and one looks like Charles Bronson. Easter egg or poor ripping?"
1,I Worship His Shadow,"Poor acting, no plot, to much gore. Better to watch something else. The move moves very slowly, and does not succeed in telling a story. I stopped watching after 40 minutes due to boredom."
2,"I wouldn't describe these discs as ""Like new""",scratches on all four sides I hope they play alright.I'm too lazy to return this is what it amounts to.
1,Farscape Rip Off,"I read other reviews on Lexx comparing it to Farscape and was excited to see this series. Unfortunately the only thing vaguely resembling Farscape was the fact that the spacecraft is alive. The characters are weak, the acting is comparable to a Saturday Morning Kids show. The special effects do have their moments, the space scenes where Lexx is cruising around are good, and the bug transporters are pretty good but mostly the CGI is old and dated.I watched each of the 4 DVDs hoping it would be better than the one before, unfortunately they are all boring and stupid. The captain of the ship is so stupid when he was onscreen I was tempted to hit the mute button. Halfway through every episode all I could think of was when will this torture be over. I gave the set 1 star because there was no zero stars."
2,Lexx season one,"Jest started disk 1, it's not good sure hope it improves, poor acting and a very poor story line. So far not wort the money"
2,SciFi Silliness,"I am watching this series on my Roku. I am not sure how much more I can watch. It is silly.In the opening scenes, we see a guy with a woman's hairdo, the computer generated face is Thomas The Train (very close) and to top it off, the one that really gets me, ia Barry Bostwick running around in a purple metal miniskirt.And the spaceship is made from a man's tooth and some amino acids......This show is beyond silly. Really. Really silly."
4,if you like sci-fi,"this is actually the four movies preceding the series. i saw two of the movies & enjoyed them very much. i did watch the series when it ran and loved it. i was sad to see it end when it did. i liked the characters; but then again i do like science fiction. it may be a little too fantastic for some people but it was good for me. if you enjoy red dwarf, then this is one you wont want to miss. try it- you'll like it!"
4,Some valuable observations here,"There are some valuable observations in this work, and a presentation of various answers given in the Jewish Tradition to the suffering of the world. But the book does not to my taste anyway meet the great question it asks with a sufficient dignity, strength, sublimity , and humility. It does very importantly point out that in the Jewish tradition questioning God is essential. And it does indicate that ultimately the final accounting belongs to G-d."
5,Inspiring!,"The questions stated on the back of the book alone, gave me enough answers to want to read the book. I have always asked ""Why?"", but I could never even think of the rest of the question. All the ""Whys"" were too confusing to sort out. Rabbi Blech did that for me, and in the meantime, answered them as well. When trying to explain what I had learned from the book to a friend, I couldn't even summon the words to start, lacking the amazing skills Rabbi Blech seems to posses of taking the most complicated idea and making it as simple as anything, while at the same time making you think. Thank you Rabbi Blech, for a work of art!"
3,It worked for what we needed,"Our 8 year old had to dress up as Saint Francis Xavier and getting costume cassocks in children's sizes is nearly impossible. Though this is not exactly a cassock, it is close enough and since Saint Francis spent enough time as missionary in India and Japan, then the costume adds a bot of that far east flavor. Not quite as nice as the picture (does not have the metallic clasp shown on the upper part in the picture) but it served its purpose fine."
5,A wonderful introduction to meditation,"My wife and I think Diane Byington's ""Breathing Meditations"" is wonderful! What a terrific way for people to learn how to meditate by focusing on their breathing. Following Diane's gentle instructions put us both in a relaxed and positive state. Diane's voice and the music she created are part of the beauty of the work. This CD will be of interest to anyone who wants to learn how to meditate or who is interested in learning new meditation techniques. I am telling people about it."
1,No Salt aftertaste,"I am very disappointed in this product. Is has an unpleasant aftertaste. I am going to use it for now, but I hope I can find something better."
1,Horrible aftertaste!,"Sadly, I have a strong salt addiction, so, I decided to buy this product and thus substitute the table salt I consume. However, it tastes HORRIBLE! You are now warned."
4,Good in moderation but ask your doctor,"I think the secret with this product is to use it in small amounts. When I use too much of it, I agree the taste gets bad. But when I use it sparingly, it does seem to improve the taste of food. I use it as one of several seasoning in moderation and enjoy it. I like avoiding excess sodium and getting some healthful potassium in my diet.Update: my doctor told me not use use this because it could be bad with the medication I'm on. He pointed out that potassium is what's used to stop people's hearts during lethal injection."
2,Much Smaller Than Expected!,"The Safe-T-Shapes are much smaller than I expected. The flowers are only about 1 1/2 inches across and the dots about 1/2 inch. Since I purchased these to replace other non skid appliqués in which some were coming up, I ended up only replacing those that needed replacement and yet still used every appliqué in all 3 of the packets. My bathtub is a normal size standard builder tub. If you are set on this design I would suggest you get 2 orders of 3 packets to insure you have proper coverage."
2,These are a waste of money,"Ok, cleaned the tile shower, intalled the little daisies, turned on the water and they washed right off. Yep used over 20 of these little things and every one of them came right off. Had to laugh, almost slipped and broke a neck, but it was funny watching them go down to the drain. Save your money, if you buy these, hold on to something or you just might break your neck."
5,Safe T Shapes White 3 pk.... for the bathtub,Wonderful item. Delivery was fast.. Grandbabies can take a bath safely in the tub without slipping... Thanks so much.
2,So Tiny!!,"These things are so small! The feet measure 4 1/2"" long and the dots are 1"" in diameter. If you really want to use these for a regular size tub get 2 packs! I didn't open the package but measured, then set it up on my computer and saw that there is no way that one package will keep me safe in the shower from slipping. I returned mine and I think I'm going to get the Moen DN7050 Home Care Glacier Tread Mat, its only $5 more and it covers the whole tub."
5,A great recording!,"I simply fell in love to this wonderful Goldberg-Recording! One should not compare this with Gould, because it's totally different..... It's peaceful, free-minded and in any single note completely relaxed and laid-back. But not at all boring, it's just that this record simply gives us back Bach in all his majesty. The sound is marvellous and the Interpretation places Ragna Schirmer (listen to her new Haydn-CD on Berlin Classics, it's a Wonder!) among the Gods of the Piano. Highest recommendations!!"
2,Good product but not what I intended to buy (poor description),"This is a ""momentarily activated"" switch (meaning you have to hold it down to power the light, pump, etc. that you intend to run). I needed an on/off swithch that would hold whatever position I put it in. This is really on me for not looking into further, but I have always felt Amazon could use better product descriptions. Many times, I find what I think I need on Amazon and go verify at another website the specifics of the item to make sure it will work for my intended purpose, then go back to Amazon to buy because of good price/reliability/reputation. It would be nice if Amazon's product descriptions matched the rest of the Amazon Experience. I went back to see if I just overlooked something, but from the Amazaon product page, there is no way to tell what type of switch this is."
3,"A Good Start For Ornette, But Not For You","""Somethin' Else"" might have been a good start for Ornette Coleman's recording career, but it is not the best place to start your Ornette Coleman CD collection. The tunes are good, and 3/4 of his classic Atlantic quartet (Ornette, Don Cherry and Billy Higgins) are present, but the album lacks musical cohesion. This is laregly due to the inclusion of piano in the group. While Paul Bley may have been able to accompany Ornette on some level, Walter Norris does not, and piano in general was not well-suited to Ornette's music. In fact, I'm not sure he ever recorded with a piano player again until recently with Geri Allen on the ""Sound Museum"" sessions. Ornette fans will certainly want to get this, but others should have a dozen other Ornette CDs under their belt before this one."
4,Good place to start,"I am a huge Ornette Coleman fan and I agree with the other reviewers in that this is not his finest work, especially since the piano sounds out of place in his music.However, if you are getting into free jazz, this is an album that is more straight ahead and less ""out"" than later work."
4,Some of you are missing the point!,"When I got this tiny box full of tiny pieces, I felt totally ripped off! I could build very little with the few pieces that came in the box. I had grand designs on building a scale model of the Eiffel Tower. So much for that.However, after a few hours I was hooked on discovering how the magnetism was working, e.g. making a 3-sided spinner as wide as possible between 2 balls, then pulling the top and bottom to decrease the radius -> increase the spin speed due to inertia... seeing how many north poles can fit on a ball til one of them just has to ping off at great speed.This toy encourages thinking beyond what you can see in front of you, to consider the invisible forces at work. This is a VERY valuable lesson which even many adults don't seem to have a grip on.Of course, you could build a tower with tens of thousands of pieces, but there are much cheaper ways of doing that (ok, maybe not as fun).It's all about the dynamics! Give it a chance!"
4,excellent gift,"This toy surprised us for its lasting durability and the sustained interest of my grandson, age 6 1/2. Ignoring a room full of toys and games, he played with the pieces almost daily and carried them back and forth to school, making interesting shapes and stories."
3,Fun but needs to be expanded,The idea behind this toy is great but they need to double the number of pieces in the box. I started to run out of ideas after about 2 hours of playing with it with my sons. We'll likely buy another and combine them.
5,Exciting LearningAdventure,I bought this for my 3 1/2 year old grandson who was totally mesmerized working with designs. His 5 year old brother and six year old sister had to wait their turn to make different configurations with the rods and magnetic balls. Even their Senior Citizen Grandfather was fascinated while manipulating the pieces. We want to order another set to add to the first one.
4,Grandson Loves It,"...my boys who are 10 and 12 received something similar a few years ago. They'd play w/ it off and on. Well, when I moved in w/ my boyfriend who has a 2 year old grandson I dug it out of a box and gave it to him to play with. Now, anytime he comes over that's all he wants to play with... It is a pretty cool toy so we're planning to get him the Geomag set for his birthday this month. No noise, no batteries... just good old imagination. He enjoys making his own shapes and his version of a house, spider, or whatever else his imagination conjures up. I definitely recommend this toy... :) Janie"
3,The pros and cons of this toy,"I bought a box of these for my friend who was turning 11. I went to her house after the party and we opened the box up. We played with them for about 15 minutes and then realized we were making the same things over and over. Later that day, I decided to buy a box myself. Just for the fun of it. I liked them. But there is a certain limit to what you can make. It's likely that if you are playing with your friend or two friends that you will run out of things to make in ten minutes. I don't think these toys are very educational. They aren't very durable meaning you can't do much with them."
4,for the older child,"I purchased these geomags for my 3 year old son. He loves toys that keep him busy. The manufacturer recommends these for ages 3-99. DON'T BUY THIS FOR YOUNG CHILDREN or if you even have younger ones in the house. The pieces are very,very tiny and I was disappointed that this was not listed on the product page. I found it a hazardous product at this time and sent it back.On a brighter note, for older children (and even adults), it would probably be an entertaining gift. Perhaps when my kids are older, I'll reconsider. It would be even better if geomags came out with larger pieces."
2,Not worth the money,"This is a good item until you look inside the box.Very few pieces for the money, and then add the cost of lost marbles and the toy is useless. My 5 year old lost interest in it after day one and I'm still finding marbles under my couch!"
4,I like this more than my kids!,"This was purchased for the holidays for my son who is 4, he had no interest at all in it. My 8 year old daughter seemed to bemuch more pleased. The set I purchased is way to small to makereally anything. It doesnt look like Amazon carries a larger set. I'd say to purchase 2 or maybe 3 because part of the contents are only marbles. All in all, this is a great way tobe creative. Storage could be a bit nicer for the price."
4,"Small, yes; but fun for all ages","My whole family likes playing with the Geomags. Even my 18 month old has a lot of fun playing with them. He has even figured out that he can stick them to other metal objects. So, I don't see any minimum age problems. Rather than saying they're small, I'd say they're expensive. One package is not enough to really get going and you want to have more. Each stick is 1 1/16 inch long. So, a package of 42, for example, will give you about 42 inches of building length. You can connect sticks end-to-end, end-to-side, or end-to-metal ball. You do have to get used to the magnets snapping together in unintended ways, but that's part of the fun."
5,"5 stars because its Joe, but read on please.....","It is really about time this was released on DVD. The quality etc is just as expected from my old VHS and the old audio CD. It is always great seeing Joe Pass play, he was the best.Bad news. For some reason you can get this same DVD at amazon.uk and it has Live in Montreaux 1977 as well. I bought it several months ago. You would need an all region player, but at least you get those amazing solo blues Joe did on that date. Most cats don't know that many of the >$25 DVD players (polaroid at Circuit City) are all region. Being Chinese made, they just want to make sure their product works and sells, they are region free!Who knows, maybe they will release the 77 date with extras, but I doubt it."
5,I was at odds,"I was at odds with playing jazz guitar and jazz saxophone. I didn't know which one to focus most of my attention to. After watching this inspirational DVD of Joe Pass' talent, I looked up every five star jazz guitar book to help me play like this guy. I may never get to Joe Pass' level, but I'll have fun trying. I made my decision after watching ten minutes of Joe climbing up and down his neck with the tips of his fingers. It was a great performance. So great, the audience members at Montreux asked if he could play again the next day. Lucky for the viewer, Joe was back in his chair jamming away. This DVD is a steal for the price they are selling it for. Go ahead and get it."
4,One of his best,"This cd has some of Tony's best playing on it, and some of his most beautiful compositions. I like it better than Premonition and Evolution, especially songs like Vilent Machine and Carolina Blue and Space Rituals."
4,"A live performance, with all that entails","Gisele MacKenzie was one of those singers I might describe as a ""second-tier favorite."" By this I mean she was not one of my real big favorites, but ranked just a bit below, as one I still liked quite a lot. And this CD does show off her voice very well. But since it was from a live performance, it suffers from the defects typical of such: the sound isn't as great as a studio would permit, and there is the expected extraneous audience noise. That doesn't make this a bad choice to add to a CD collection; it does mean I can't really give it a top (five-star) rating. A four-star rating still, by my standards, is a recommendation to buy it if you like ""my kind of music."" It is just not up to the stellar range of the CDs I've given the top rating to.Some of the material is topical from 1956, and shows that. If you weren't alive then, you might not understand the allusions. That's just a warning; you'll have to expect such things."
4,Insights from Successful Coaches,"""Why We Win"" provides coaches with interviews on winning with some of the biggest names in coaching. The book goes way beyond the X's and O's and focuses on the leadership skills used by coaches to get the most out of their athletes and teams.Overall the book is great because Billy Packer taps into the minds of many of the most successful coaches. The only minor drawback is that the interview questions Packer used were too rigid and didn't allow the coaches to go more in depth in their answers.This book is a must for any coach who wants to develop winners both on and off the court/field."
5,Maureen Does It Again!,"Re-visit the west with this great story.Kit Thornton has always been in love with Jake and so when he left town she wrote stories staring Jake as a fearless and brave man who makes sure justice is served.Jake returns to Chaney after being gone for so long but he does not look a thing like the young man he once was or like the man that Kit has idolized for so long. This Jake is hard and dangerous and tired of everyone trying to prove that he is not the fast gunslinger bounty hunter there is. What happens when this man and this lady get together is something you will have to read about. Lets just say that Kit has bought Jakes old ranch, has taken in the son he did not know he had, and oh yes she is responsible for the larger then life reputation that he has acquired due to her fantastic imagination. Don't miss this story."
4,hunting the comeback trail,"HUNTING THE COMEBACK TRAIL is a splendid book about several handicapped sportsmen who have adapted to their situation in life. their love of the sport of hunting and the outdoors helps them to overcome their disabilities.the book is set up with each chapter telling the story of an individual who loves to hunt, how they became handicapped and what they have done since. the author is one of these individuals. he tells his own story and experiences firsthand.i truly enjoyed this book and recommend to all sportsmen."
5,Nice improvement for my Affinity,"I got a used Squire Affinity, and put these on. Also put on a new triple ply pick guard, which I recommend for these.The wiring diagram is is not too clear on this but you must ground the empty third tab on the volume pot! If you are not good at soldering, get someone to do it for you. I had a bad ground wire on my used Squire, so make sure all the connections are OK. Great sounding pickups, and as they say, noiseless."
5,A season not to miss.,Oz Season 6 is finally here. You can expect a season that will not dissapoint with as many twists and turns as all the other seasons put together. Relationships build and relationships diminish. The light of freedom is within grasp for one of the main characters but does he grab hold or throw it all away? If your an Oz fan this is a season not to miss.
2,Not so good,I agree with many of the reviewers here that Season 6 is too rushed and too over-the-top. I even had trouble following the various threads of each episode. I guess they had to stop somewhere but I wish it had ended better.
4,Decent End to a Great Series,"I had never seen the sixth season before I purchased this item. I had been a fan of the series until I moved and was unable to watch it anymore. I had heard about the sixth season, but I was unable to find it in any major retailer. I was a little disappointed with the ""end"" of the series. It just seemed that they wrote 8 shows to kill off some people and end some of the on-going story lines. I was however pleasently suprised by the last episode, and the ending definately left it open for the series to continue. This was a decent end to a GREAT series."
5,OZ - Lives up to standards.,The presentation is unusual in that it brings back to life those who were killed before and they help tell the story. Most of the characters stories get resolved.
2,didn't care for it.,"I have been a fan of Oz since the first season. With that being said, I truly did not care for season 6. You can tell that it was rushed out. Its almost like the writers didn't know what else to do, so they just started killing everyone off. Its really ridiculus. I bought this season, and by the second disc, i found myself not really wanting to even finish the set. Well, thats my opinion."
4,INTELLIGENT BUT UNREAL,"I HAVE WATCHED THE ENTIRE SERIES OF OZ - THIS SHOW STARTED OFF VERY GOOD BUT AS THE SERIES WENT ON AND THE BODY COUNT MOUNTED AND MOUNTED - IT BECAME SILLY AT TIMES - HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE TO DIE BEFORE THEY CLOSE THE PRISON.AND HOW MANY CHANCES ARE INMATES GIVEN TO KILL AND KILL AGAIN.IF YOU FORGET ABOUT REALITY THIS SHOW IS SOMETIMES BRUTAL, FUNNY AND SOME VERY GOOD TWISTS."
3,"Not it's best season, but still really good","For all the liberties Oz always took with reality (prisoners have more freedom and restrictions than those of us on the outside), it makes up for it with outstanding and complex characters.Season 6 made me glad, and sad the series was coming to a close. Glad, because it wasn't quite as good as the early years. The mortality rate was too high, as 2 or 3 characters were killed weekly, presumably for ""shock value."" But mostly sad because one of the most innovative, entertaining, and groundbreaking shows in television history was gone. I recommend this DVD strongly, but would suggest watching all seasons to get the ultimate ""Oz experience."""
5,The OZ,"Needed season six to complete my collection. Great series, wish they would have continued it!! DVD's were in very good condition when they arrived."
3,So-So,"Its a good deal as far as the price, but the smell is very weak compared to the same thing in smaller bottles."
2,used,"ordered a new book recieved a dirty used one. this is a gift also, paid new price. Would have liked to recieve a new one as what i paid for, not impressed."
5,GREAT!,"I have read the first three of the Sisters of the Quantock Hills books now, and this one is definitely the best so far. If you liked the other books, you'll LOVE this one (as I do). However, this one is more sad than the others (but you'll but prepared for most of what happens by reading the first two). The other books don't say too much about Julia, but this book shows what an amazing character she is. This book is a wider range of time than the others (Sarah's Story and Frances' Story are 1910-1920, Julia's Story is 1910-1930. Julia's age ranges from about 15-35) but its still REALLY good. you also learn more about what happened with Frances and Gabriel. I haven't read Gwen's Story yet, but I hope to very soon!"
4,World War I as seen from the front,"I think this book is the best of the three Quantock Hill stories I've read so far. The scenes in hospitals in France during the war are so real, you feel you are there. As with the other stories, you see some of the same events, but from a different point of view. ... it's a sad story in many ways, and very moving. Definitely read the other books in the series too!"
3,Not impressed...,"Got these for our white board in the office. Was really excited about all of the colors. Most of them worked just fine, actually, and have lasted a few months (though we don't use them excessively). However, some of the colors are very faint and impossible to see from far away no matter how big you write. The orange was particularly bad. In the future, I'd probably just go with the standard 4 colors."
1,Don't DO IT !,"It is pretty and is nice and heavy.Aside from that...it is the WORST pan I've ever owned.I am a commercial kitchen consultant and know something about cookware.They said it had a Non-Stick surface. B.S.I cooked with it as if it didn't, using lots of oil for one dish, and butter for another.EVERYTHING STUCK to this pan surface.I have no patience for returning things like this....I'll be returning it to the dumpster."
2,Evolution: From Molecules to Ecosystems (Oxford Biology),"The book title page was beauty color picture. the title expression caught my interesting about the evolution. but, the book inside was almost sentences only through the book (with some no color graphs). So, my interesting died. My English understanding level is less than high school level. I love Oxford's Modular Science series, also Oxford children's encyclopedia of science series too (i often read friendly these series).My level is like that. so, this ""evolution"" was too hard for me. I am a Japanese."
1,"Baaaaad, I bought this since middle May, and didn't get it","It have bben more than a month now, I bought other stuff before this, and all shipped to me and delivered.Only this oneBad shipment"
3,Great space saver,"When they work, they take up 1/4 the space of normal storage. Do not always retain their vaccuum."
2,"The Large didn't work, but the Extra-Large did","I bought a package of 2 of these Large space bags, and a package of 2 Extra-Large. The Large did not stay deflated for more than a day, but the Extra-Large are still good, a month later. Go figure!"
1,doesn't hold air,"I love the idea and they really compress the cloths well. The problem is they leak and suck air back in over a few hours. I have bought these twice and all of the bags have leaked.I hear others have had better luck, not me. I won't buy them again."
3,"Not a revolutionary, but a good product","I found that this was a fair deal. Price comparison to under-the-bed storage containers is equivalent. It didn't vacuum out so much air that I now had a drawer full of clothes the size of a dime, but it did vacuum out a significant amount of air and compared to under-the-bed storage containers, these are superior because their shape is not as fixed; you could store these in more places than a bulky storage container. But if you've already compressed your clothing tightly, the vacuum isn't going to significantly reduce the size and space bags aren't going to replace my other storage containers. Overall a good value, but no coos or ooo's and ah's from me."
1,Not the film Beast within,Please be aware this is not the Film Beast Within it is a collection of 4 cheap straight to dvd low budget horror fodder
4,easy sharpener,"I read the manual, followed the instructions, and within 20 minuted had a shaving sharp knife. Doesnt get much easier than that. I gave it a four star because it is very slow with any kind of reprofile. A couple of my knives came from the factory with edge angles that needed the shoulder cut down signifigantly before hitting the edge at the 40 degree so I rested some wet dry sandpaper(not suggesting this method as i am sure there is a better way) against the brown stone at the 30 degree and that sped things up. The majority of my knives have not needed this treatment and sharpened very easily. Best attribute of this sharpener is the repeatability of edge angle and the ease of touch ups after initial sharpening.I also have the Lansky guided sharpener and use the Sharpmaker almost exclusively."
4,Best of its type.,"This is the most versitile and highest quality crock stick type sharpener around. It does take a little practice but after a few knives most people will have no problem if their knives are not damaged or very dull. If your knives are very dull you will need the diamond hones or rubber band some sandpaper to the sharpmaker stones as I did, the sandpaper won't last but it's cheap. Bottom line, slow for heavy sharpening, quick for touch up sharpening, and works with all types of blades unlike most sharpeners."
4,Easy Peasy,"Sharpened 5 kitchen knives that haven't been sharpened for the 4 years I've had them. All came out with the ability to cut a small sliver off of typing paper without effort. I don't know if that's a good measurement of success, but none could do it before the Spyderco Sharpmaker was used. The only problems I've had with them is after the third knife a straight line down the center of the plain sides on all the triangles appeared. I also noticed that one of the fine triangles didn't look flat when I opened the package. I have not been able to push cut typing paper like I can with my Manix 2, hopefully that will come with more practice."
5,Spyderco Sharpmaker Sharp!,"I purchased this spyderco sharpmaker after much research and questioning. I am pleased to tell you that I am 100% satisfied with the results. I have many knives and I have always had a tough time sharpening them, now I can. I love the design and the variety of functions that it serves. I have sharper knives and I feel comfortable with this system. I also love that you can pack it all up in the box easily without needing instructions to do so. I recommend this sharpening system to anyone who likes a sharp knife and an easy system.......(I imagine this includes everyone!)"
2,I've tried everything and this ain't it..,"Okay sharpener.. but if you watch the video, that guy makes it seem like this is the best sharpener on the planet. It isn't. It certainly does not leave ANY blade sharper than when it came from the manufacturer. It isn't easy and I've tried everything from the old stones to modern diamond sharpeners. You can get it close but you can't get it NEW... not unless you send it back to the manufacturer. Perhaps I'm finicky but if I pay for ""the best"" I expect it, this ain't it.. so when you get the product don't expect it to give you razor sharp results for this is just a decent sharpener with alot of hype..."
5,Simply ingenious - buy one now!,"I'm somewhat of a knife guy, and have owned a few Spyderco knives over the past 10 years and have been impressed with their design and build quality. I've heard several people over the years rave about the Sharpmaker, but I never took the plunge because I felt that my previous sharpening methods worked well enough. (I've used most popular sharpening methods.)My wife got me a Sharpmaker as a gift, and all I can say is that this thing is ingenious! It is extremely well designed and versatile. By now, you've probably read several reviews praising the Sharpmaker, so I'm not going to restate what's already been said. My only regret is that I didn't buy a Sharpmaker several years ago. Spend the time to read the instructions and watch the video. Good luck!"
5,Takes Practice,This is a really afordable sharpener and I would advise buying one just to keep a knife sharp. This is by no means a way to reprofile a knife's edge. With practice to can achieve incredibly sharp edges. I sugest buying the UF stones as well.
5,this product is sharp,What can I say after a little practice this will make your cutlery scary sharp. I use this product monthly to keep things sharp. I was cutting ribs the other day and sliced right through the bone and did'nt even notice until I seved them. Sharpening knives with this product is a breeze but be prepared to spend a little time getting it right. If you appreciate sharp knives buy this.
5,"Easy to use, difficult to master","Works great and can put an edge on lower quality steels (kitchen knives) very quickly. Also easy to keep a decent edge on the average pocket knife, but can be very frustrating if you want that hair popping sharpness. Maybe the extra fine stones would get you there but as it is it takes a lot of practice to get really good sharpness. I still use it more than my other sharpeners because it is so easy and fast and if you don't mind keeping after your blades week to week they will stay very usable."
5,Liked it so much I bought another one for my dad,"I have tried many different sharpening methods, and while I probably could get sharper with my Japanese whetstones, the Spyderco is remarkably quick and gives an extremely sharp edge. The amount of technique is minimal but I highly recommend watching the DVD or youtube videos. I liked it so much I bought one for my dad and will consider it as a gift to anyone who uses knives in sport or the kitchen."
5,"nice and quick, no mess no guess","works great, no oil or water needed. 20 passes on each stone and I almost reduced my finger count to 9 (due to sloppy opening of a just sharpened pocket knife - no fault of the product). The triangle stone design allows you to sharpen any blade, from serrated to scissors and the groove works on hooks and steel darts, etc. Comes with instructional DVD and booklet. Everything packs into the base and cover snaps on tight for easy storage or carry in a backpack. I also purchased the ultra fine stones (they are sold individually so buy 2), which i probably didn't need, the stones included in the orignal kit get a blade sharp enough to shave with. Base positions stone rods at either 40 or 30 degrees and can also hold rods so they can be used as a flat stone. Great product, i will be purchasing more for gifts.Includes:2 coarse stone rods2 fine stone rods2 brass safety guard rods1 base1 cover1 instructional DVD1 instructional booklet"
3,Not For Dull Blades,It's very easy to use but not very effective on dull knives. You need the diamond rods to reshape a dull blade so that the supplied rods can be effective. Good on fairly sharp blades.
1,Spyderco sharpener,"The sharpener is a system of two sharpening stones.Only one stone was sent.I cannot use it by itself.Come on Amazon.com, send the other stone."
3,Chef's Choice is still my go-to...,"I've tried sharpening my Henckel's chef's knives 3-4 different times, closely following the instructions each time, with the same fairly disappointing results. I just broke out my Chef's Choice 120 for comparison and my knives are razor sharp in no time at all. I'll keep the spyderco for outdoors use when no power is available, but the chef's choice electric sharpener has worked much better for me."
1,Spyderco-n,Did some research on Spyderco before I purchased. Viewed some videos and I took a chance on it. Sad to say it didn't perform as claimed. It did not sharpen my knives at all. I would not recomend it anyone.
1,Way to fradgile,"Had less than a week, one slip off counter to my ceramic floor and both stones broke. I didn't even finish sharpening one set of knives. Cost $30 to replace stones. Not really sure how good it sharpens since I never got the hang of using it, but the couple of knives I did do, did not seem that great (sharp). It's harder than it looks, trying to keep the knife at the perfect angle (straight) for a total of 160 stokes. Also a pain to clean (which is how I broke them) seems to need to be done after every knife.Maybe useful for a pocket knife, but would not recommend for a professional cutlery set."
5,"If you need an easy way to get a razor edge, this is it!","I love this system! I actively look for things to sharpen with it. My every day carry knife easily shaves hair now, something I've always struggled to do using flat stones. It was a little weird at first, but once you get used to it, it's so very simple and easy.Absolutely worth the money! If you need to do major reshaping, I'd recommend the diamond sticks. They're not cheap, a bit too expensive in my opinion, but you can't argue with their effectiveness.Everything in my house now has a wicked razor edge,from knives to scissors to chisels. So for me, it was worth every penny."
4,I like it,"After reading many reviews I chose this product and with the video, I found it easy to use and it did a nice job on my knives. I read many reviews that said they had bad results, but for what I need it is a great improvement over what I had. It gives me a sharp edge and that is all I need."
3,sharpmaker,"I have used this before but ended up loosing it. So I ordered another. When I received it one of the coarse stones had a crack in it and ended up breaking. Past experience had been this is by far the best sharpening system available. When matched with a leather stop and some patience, the results can exceed your expectations."
5,Amazing,"I just got this for Christmas as a gift and I'm in love. I was able to sharpen three knives with minimal effort and got a great edge on all three. The DVD instructions, while a bit corny, are excellent. I highly recommend this product."
1,I don't get it.,"OK, obviously a lot of people find this a great product. It was a waste of money to me. I've watched the DVD and read the instructions, and it does look easy and simple and I'd swear I'm going it right. Yet it will not sharpen any kitchen knife I've tried. Everything from cheap Chicago cutlery to high-quality Henckels knives. Oddly, it takes metal off, as I can tell from the residue on the stones, and from the blade shape. But it doesn't get sharp. All sizes, all shapes. Nothing. The only thing I've managed to sharpen is a pocket knife; that's like a razor now. Perhaps this is just somehow a defective rarity, but potential buyers should beware."
1,Should've heeded the negative reviews,"I've had this sharpener for >6 months now and am really disappointed with it, mainly because it's hyped as such an easy system AND costs $50 simoleons. I've spent hours of practice trying to get a sharp edge on multiple different knives -- I've faithfully watched the video and carefully followed the manual - nice easy, consistent hand motions, straight-up & down against the sides of the ""V"". While some knives took a fine edge OK - though NEVER killer sharp - others were slightly worse for it. And the bit in the video where the guy easily slices paper with all manner of his newly sharpened knives: in your dreams, Bucko! In the end, I've gotten more predictable results with my Arkansas stone, or - God save my knives - with a fine-grade diamond sharpening rod. Consider the other negative reviews on this system before you pull the trigger. I wish I'd gone for a different sharpening solution."
2,"Ok, not great - don't buy for high end kitchen knives","I bought this and tested on a pocket knife. It worked OK, but not great. I never achieved a ""razor sharp"" edge. I then tried on a high quality Chef's knife, and after 20 minutes or so, the knife still wouldn't cut the skin of a tomato. I then went to a local kitchen store and purchased an electric sharpener. In the less than 60 seconds, this same knife was able to shave the hair off my arm, and make paper thin slices off a tomato.If you intend is to sharpen high quality knives - save yourself some time and go electric. If you need something to do touch ups on pocket/fishing knives, then maybe this will work for you."
5,all the hype is true,"I have always been able to sharpen my knives to shaving sharp by hand. It may take a while, with stones and a strop, but I would eventually get there. For years I had been hearing the hype about the sharpmaker and just thought that those people didn't know what they were doing to start with, so they were easy to impress. Well, I found one on sale and decided to give it a try. WOW! What would take me 30 minutes to do by hand now takes 5 minutes tops. You can literally touch up a blade back to 'scary sharp' with about 5 passes per side. Well worth the purchase price!"
5,Razor Sharp,"I've seen this sharpener in action on youtube and decided to give it a go. Previously I was using the pocket sharpeners and they were useless. I sharpened my Leatherman e33bx using the 30 degree back bevel and finished with the 40 degree all-purpose edge. I could shave the hair off my arm. I took the sharpener to work and sharpened a co-workers Buck (extremely dull) until I could shave the hair off my arm.I clean it with Ajax or Comet. This thing works. I'm completely satisfied. They say there is a learning curve, but it is really easy to do."
1,deceptively difficult,"I've spent 10-12 hours trying to use this product correctly. I've watched the video 3 or 4 times. For me, the product should be called ""Dullmaker."" I even wrote the company for help - and was ignored. It's a deceptively difficult system to use correctly. I'd swear I'm doing just what the instructions/video calls for. But the knife tears paper instead of cutting it. I've cleaned the stones several times. I just don't get it. One of the worst purchases I've ever made."
4,easy to get a sharp accurate edge,"The CD shows how to easily sharpen just about everything with an edge. I've just begun with my very dull knives and found they will need a bit of work with the medium sharpening stone. I thought about getting a coarse stone to make things go quicker, but after I get them sharp I'm never going to let them get this dull again! For a moderately dull knife, this simple device will make it razor-sharp with just a little effort. I'm excited to get my scissors in shape and never thought i'd be able to put an new edge on my potato peeler."
5,"NICE SHARPENER, BUT MAYBE NOT FOR YOUR WIFE","First, I bought this sharpener because of the great reviews it got. I still agree with how nice this product works. Sharpened my already sharp knives to razor sharp with some time. Getting the initial angles down takes some time because you will have to remove a lot of steel.Second, I was also hoping it would be easy enough for my wife to use, but there are too many steps involved for her to want to use it. Not willing to spend 5 minutes to get her knife sharp again, but rather spend the time cooking.Anyway, it's a great product for anyone who is willing to spend a little time getting their knives razor sharp.Pros: Amazing ability to sharpen knife to razor sharpness.Cons: Several steps to arrive at absolute sharpness.Overall, you won't be disappointed at this price."
5,Spyderco Sharpmaker-Excellent product,"I was tired of my knives that wouldn't cut cake, let alone fruit, vegetables, or meat. Now all the knives in this house are dangerous. I was somewhat intimidated by the manual method required, but after watching a few YouTube videos I went ahead and ordered it. It doesn't take long to master the technique. You will only need to read the directions and watch the DVD once. I take it with me when I visit friends and family so I can show them how dull their knives really are. Awesome tool."
5,A Great Sharpener!,"This is a great sharpener! I thought the picture of the sharpener was a little confusing when I viewed it on-line, but the sharpener comes with an excellent DVD and a very detailed book/manual. After watching the DVD, it was no problem learning how to use the instrument. Other brand sharpeners tend to be limited in what they can sharpen, but the Spyderco Triangle Sharpener can sharpen just about anything you can imagine and do it well. I have sharpened smooth bladed knives, serrated knives, razor knives and sizzors. It's really nice to have a kitchen drawer full of sharp knives."
5,EVERYONE NEEDS THIS!!!,The title of this review says it all. If you hate using dull kitchen knives or will never use your carry/pocket knife because you're afraid of making it dull; then buy this sharpener and never worry about it again! Anyone can use it and IT REALLY WORKS!
4,Mind expanding,This books gets you thinking hard about perspectives in education. Makes you question everything you believe about education.
4,Italian Flash Cards,Easy to use and helpful to supplement grammar lessons. Fun to use and increase vocabulary. Ten cards every few days does the trick.
1,"For me, not at all useful","Firstly, genders are not given for the nouns. Nor are example sentences, illustrating a correct use of the word. Twenty years ago I had the Vis-ed cards and. cassette for French and they were superior to these. For each word a useful sentence using the word was given in both languages. I am returning these if it is possible."
4,Very good study aid.,"Nowadays the art of learning a new language has changed, its not so much drilling as it use to be (and more so learning as we learned our native tongue), BUT it is still necessary to increase your vocabulary and this cards help with that allot."
4,JM,"This is one of my CDs that from time to time I put it playing again and again. And I do it mainly because of two of its tracks: ""2. Who's on first?"" and ""6. Double play"". If you are a jazz fan check it by yourself, I am sure that you will not feel disappointed."
5,Who can't love Mater?,"This is an adorable short. Mater and the Ghostlight is one of the funniest Pixar shorts that I have seen, and I have watched, and whenever I am feeling blue, it is the one I often pull out to watch for a few minutes of downtime, which makes me feel more up.The character of Mater is so simple, innocent, and good hearted, you can't help but love him. I would never hesitate to allow a small child to watch this cutie, and you can feel quite comfortable allowing your own little one to enjoy this lovely short.Enjoy!"
4,There's something to be said for obscurity ...,"... and it's ""damn, what a shame."" For the Stevens Sisters' pitch-perfect cover of Steve Earle's ""My Old Friend the Blues"" alone, this is an album well worth owning and turning to again and again. But fortunately there's much more here. Beautifully matched voices, a flawless feel for the material and heartening simplicity are only starters. This is real country done real well."
1,Sarcastic isn't synonymous with witty,"Self-indulgent, boring, juvenile. Annoying people just to annoy them is something emotionally stable people grow out of."
2,Thin metal & very lightweight,"This particular architect lamp is not worth more than $15 retail. Not only is the lamp very light in weight and its metal thin and of low quality, but the one I received was factory packaged with a dent in the shade, tiny scratches visible here and there, and the cover on the base partially pulled off and stuck to the underside (exposing a rough edge which would eventually scratch the surface of any furniture). Anyone who buys this lamp at the almost $50 range it retails for would be making a ""penny wise and pound foolish"" decision. Take the money you would have spent on this product and put it towards another lamp that may cost more, but is of better quality manufacturing and won't dent like a soda can."
1,Not Good,"This gun is bad. It has terrible accuracy and is pretty weak. It you want it to go kind of far, you have to aim upward and it gets annoying. Also, there are pieces that rattle in the inside. Some times you can get it to stop but it doesn't go away. And it doesn't shoot every time. You can cock it, and it won't shoot(probably twice a clip) All in all, its just not good. There are better guns you can get for the price...go to Airsplat.com or airsoftmegastore.com or shortyusa.com These are all good sites"
1,pretty decent for the price IF you dont drop it,"okay so first of it is a pretty good gun. when i got it the first thing i noticed was real metal. most of the gun is metal. the second thing i noticed was something was loose inside of it, turns out the slide lock had broken, but the gun is still functional. it has a real magazine release and a realistic magazine. it shoots pretty decent too, not very accurate at range though it shoots about 10 yards before it wants to curve off steep. pretty decent power too. pretty easy to take apart too. all in all if the slide lock hadn't been broken it probably would have a higher rating. makes a good side arm, or prop gun for movies.on a side note, if you do by this as a side arm keep in mind that it is single shotafter using it for a while i accidentally dropped the gun from a kneeling position and the gun's grip and firing mechanism broke."
1,This gun is no good!,"I purchased this gun thinking that it was a good price for the gun. After shooting about 20 bb's, it got jammed and had to take it apart to unjam it. It is a cheapy thing that I would not recommend to anyone."
3,Vertical Smiles repackaged,"This is repackaged footage from Vertical Smiles in Austin Texas. They started reworking their DVDs a couple of years ago and pulled from the market pretty much their entire collection. Some of the reworked DVDs seem to have ended up with Peach, which is a larger company with more a extensive distribution network. If you have a sizable collection of Vertical Smiles DVDS produced under their own brand name you'll find a lot of overlapping footage, but they have included some new footage they hadn't released before.Quality of the girls varies from the average looking girl who's willing to get wild and show off to a couple of girls with Playboy model potential who you'd like to see more footage of. The blonde cover girl actually did appear in a Playboy Coeds Special Edition.For the quality of material and the girls I'd give it four stars, but because it's mostly repackaged material that knocks off a star."
4,Have A Laugh With the Dayes.,"This is a good funny disney that is a good rent or buy for the family on any night. you might get laugh or two from this family film. why can't disney write stories like this, instead of the bland boring stuff their releasing nowadays?A Good Rent or Buy."
4,wearing my second one,The band may last 12 months or 36 months - thats been my experience - but I keep coming back cause the watch feels good and does what I need.
4,Really nice earrings,"Quick shipping, safe packaging, great price, and nice product. The earrings are longer than I expected, which is a good thing. I love to wear them."
5,pretty earrings,"I love these earrings. I like to wear light green and purple, and these earrings go with both clothing colors. I love how bright and clear the stones are. I've been wearing the earrings for 5 months, and the silver has not tarnished. I plan to buy a pair for my sister's birthday because she likes mine so much. :)"
1,They look and feel like plastic,"I haven't taken these to a gemologist yet, but I suspect the word ""genuine"". I own many crystals, and these have the look and feel of plastic. If I take them to a gemologist I will edit this review and let you know for sure. Just be warned that they are suspect, and in my opinion not worth the purchase."
2,"Perfect for my container water garden, but doesn't last long.","I didn't want something very splashy (pun intended), just something to add interest to my container water garden on the balcony. This unit is just the right size and works quietly, so it won't disturb the neighbors. Easy to set up and maintain. If you have a large water garden, you might want something more powerful, but for small gardens, this is fine.Update:I bought it in October. It is now April. The pump is pumping less and less water."
1,Wimpy Pump,My application is in a 1/2 whisky barrel with a plastic liner to replace my previous fountain pump. This pump does not pump water like a fountain the water just dribbles out even when pump is set to + setting. I plan to return this pump. I'm disappointed.Beckett 7093110 Container Garden Fountain Kit
5,Classic McCutcheon,"I have enjoyed John McCutcheon's work ever since he first gave a concert in my town. Of his other records, such as Doing Our Job, Family Garden, etc., Sprout Wings and Fly is one of my favorites. The unusual and terrific songs on this album are Reuben, with a digeridoo background; Ludlow Massacre, a haunting tune about a miner's rebellion; Heaven's Wake, a lament by the love of a sailor; and Time Has Made a Change in Me, an all-out favorite of mine. If you like McCutcheon's work, I would say that this is a great one to add to your collection."
3,OK. But where is this going?,"I love the claw-hammer style banjo on this CD, but the material was too uneven for me. I guess John McCutcheon could be considered a modern day troubador, like Pete Seeger. But it doesn't always work out that way for me."
5,Great Book for Engineering Students,"This book is great for students who are thinking of persuing a course in engineering. Ferguson adresses what makes a great engineer, and also states that many schools do not stress the courses they should. Using this book, students gain insight as to what they should expect from being an engineer, and what is imporant in the profession. I definately recommend this book to those who are about to be college freshman engineers or are thinking of changing over from liberal arts & sciences to engineering."
5,Re-affirms my own personal phiosophies after 30+ years.,Profesor Ferguson has a wonderful insite into real engineering. His discussion of the slide rule and the computor is right on the mark. One of the most rewarding books I've read in many years.
4,"Very Informative, but...","It is very boring to read, unless you have a keen interest in the art of engineering. I was required to read this for my class. I think it made me less interested in pursuing a career in engineering...too much work. Where's that book on how to be a millionaire in 21 days when you need it?"
2,Full Frame videos from widescreen movies ...,"For Elvis fans...this appears to be very fun..a nice collection of clips from old TV appearances and Movies and the TWO BONUS press conferences are absolutely essential. My huge complaint is that the clips from the movies and concert films are presented FULL FRAME..and cropped pretty severely in some cases (like Jailhouse Rock which was a very widescreen film). If you don't mind the cropping of picture then give it an extra couple of stars and enjoy!REVIEW UPDATE!!this is now available in the UK (amazon.co.uk) as an NTSC release..with a HUGE exception...it has 30 clips!!! plus the same two bonus features...its TWICE the material!!! They call it ""ELVIS the king of Rock N Roll"" and has the gold sticker on the front with the #1's logo...."
2,Elvis for Beginners,"The folks at RCA really dropped the ball on this one. When considering the extensive amount of Presley footage, ""Elvis #1 Hit Performances"" is a half-hearted, slapdash effort. The DVD exists as a sampler for the uninitiated, with poorly edited ""bonus material."" If RCA had any integrity, they would pull this release off the market and start from scratch."
3,A little sample,"Well, the quality is not the best. However if you wish a little sample of the king's performances this is the DVD."
5,Elvis,I got this for my mother as a gift once because she loves Elvis. She thoroughly enjoyed it and wanted more.
3,Elvis,"DVD is OK; it is a re-hash of some of his early performances.Many are in B&W;, or colorized.All the music is not enhanced, NO stereo sound.If you want to see Elvis in his original performances from the 1950's and 1960's, it is fine.There are 15 songs on the disc."
4,Good Stuff,"A few of the songs were a little to much on the bluesy side (the name of the album is Blues Party - duh) for my personal taste, but overall , the album is excellent. Fernest is an excellent accordion player, with a nice voice, and he has a great back up crew playing with him on this CD. I recommend if you like the New Orleans old school version of zydeco."
3,easy and FAT from the oven,I was a little disappointed. The recipes I made were very tasty but also very high in calories and most of then required some precooking before going into the oven.
5,Electrician's friend,I've bought many of these fiberglass multi-bit screwdrivers made by Allway. I'm an industrial electrician and having a screw driver that has been tested to 2000 volts gives me and my coworkers peace of mind. It's very convenient that there is a magnet in the tip. This helps hold screws when when installing them. This screwdriver is lightweight and the other three bits store in the back when not in use. Sadly Stanley has bought this tool from Allway and finding the orange and black Allway screwdrivers rated to 2000V is becoming harder. Walmart used to sell them but now they sell the Stanley version (Walmart now sells only Stanley which is cheap Chinese made junk) which is yellow and black and is not voltage rated so it isn't tested to 2000V like the orange Allway version. Buy the orange Allway version from Amazon while you still can.
5,The only screwdriver for everyday use,Since I found this screwdriver in a local hardware store I gave up using any other.It handles any kind of projects and if you don't hit it with a hammer it will last for many years.I'm writing this and hope this excellent tool will be around for years ahead.
2,This is not the Ed Gein Movie,"This is not the Ed Gein based Movie ""Deranged"" from 1974. That movie is hard to find. I rented this movie thinking it was the Ed Gein film.This movie is a VERY LOW BUDGET psychological story of a woman who goes crazy. I liked it overall, and it gives some insight to how insane people may see the world. It's worth watching once, but I would never buy it."
2,Nightmarish Atmosphere of the Insane,This film has a very claustrophobic atmosphere due to the fact that most of it is shot in one apartment. The plot is about a woman who loses her grip on reality after killing a would be rapist in her home. Apparently she was on the edge of insanity before this event took place. She has hallucinations and soon madness and reality are inseparable. A character study of a deranged mind that I thought had a few similarities to Roman Polanksi's Repulsion.
3,DADDY'S LITTLE DELIGHT,"Well I just got done watching Deranged for like the tenth time, and realized that this poor movie is very underrated. I happened to rent it a few years ago and loved it. Yes, it is very low budget. But for 95% of the movie filmed in and apartment, I am impressed. The plot is pritty thick. The story telling how Joyce (Jane Hamilton) became insane is done through her Hallucinations. Jane Hamilton gives a great performance. She really draws you into her character. If you like Psychological Thrillers like the Tenant or Possession, I think you will like this one. It is not out on DVD, but you can find it on VHS cheap."
5,american experience vietnam volume 3,Very good great war footage much I have never seen before I give 4 stars
5,a terrific ensemble!,"This book was one of the best Xmas gifts I've ever received. It's loaded with good work, fiction, poetry, memiors, and essays. Evan S. Connell's story alone is worth the price for any one thinking of buying this fine book. I have always liked good writing (the recovering English major that I am), but have felt depressed about the current state of letters. Oprah's book club wasn't cutting it for me (but I loved The Corrections). This antology rescues my faith. Bravo, Mr. Henderson! I'm a Pushcart fan for life."
2,Feature poor system,Extremely limited options for a surround sound system.No way to balance front and rear speakers.Equalizer settings very limited.No rewind or fast forward options on tape player 1.Moderate to extreme distortion on volume levels above 16.
4,2nd best mushroom book,The pictures in this guide are not quite as nice as in the audubon version but is still easy to use and a nice handy size for carrying in a pocket
5,Best Go To reference for edible mushrooms,This is the best go to reference book for collecting edible mushrooms. The color drawing can impart much more info than photos. Clearly describes what to look for and what to look out for.
2,A bit too old school,"While the descriptions in this book are helpful, the illustrations are inherently imprecise because they are non-photographic. The size of the book is good for taking into the field, but I'm put off by the old-school descriptions of mushrooms that have psychedelic/entheogenic properties. These important fungal allies are dismissed as ""hallucinogenic"" used by certain people for recreational purposes. Therefore they are labelled poisonous.Overall, I found that I felt I couldn't trust the book to provide the kind of precision and accuracy that I need to be confident about my identifications. I would say use it as a secondary guide, or for an initial assessment of your fungal findings, but rely on more modern sources that also provide photographs."
5,Clean and un-used,"This book has nice illustrations, no photos, but the drawings are clear and well colored. Should be a companion book in forays, not the only reference source."
2,ARE YOU A PHD?,"I was very disappointed in this REFERENCE book for PHD's. I wanted a ""FIELD"" guide - not a detailed reference book to info about fungi that I cannot and do not want to know or understand. I just wanted a picture & short description book to identify edible vs inedible mushrooms. DO NOT Buy this book looking for a simple field guide, but a detailed PHD analysis of fungi. I did not return it because the costs of shipping exceeds the cost of the book. Maybe I will find someone who has the time and intellect to like this book."
1,SMALL,Should have specified that the size was appropriate for a child or teenager not a grown adult!
5,"Top quality, inside and out.","Literary Potpourri is one of the few anthologies I own that provides a gamut of literary and visual entertainment from cover to cover. Ms. Jackson has invited innovative writers of short stories, flash fiction, as well as photographers and poets, to share a little bit of their world with us. I wouldn't miss it!"
5,It doesn't get any better than this.,"Literary Potpourri is one of the best sites around, for fresh and innovative writing. This anthology captures a snapshot of that quality, putting it all between two covers for posterity."
4,"You need to know this, even if you don't use it","If you are a serious poker player then you will need to know this strategy, even if you don't use it fully.It is worth knowing, as you may need to pull it out your repertoire on occasion. Plus you will need to recognise when it is being used against you."
2,There are better books out there,"This book was way too basic.It mainly said play super tight and move all in against ""Phils""so they can't outplay you.Tell me something I don't know"
5,I already made more than I paid for the book!,"I read about this book and I ordered it in advance. I can't tell you how much it has helped me already. I have been getting pushed around ever since I started playing online poker, but as soon as I read this book I won two $10 sit and gos in a row. All of a sudden, I was doing the pushing! I have to admit that the techniques in this book are scary to try, but they sure seem to work. I am rereading it now to try and better understand all of the math and examples that the authors presented. I am going to go to a real tournament in December in Los Angeles. Look out City of Angels. Thanks Blair and Lee."
3,Very Interesting Concept,"I dont run across too many ""Phils"" in the games I play, but enjoyed reading this. Im a little skeptical about how much success one would have playing against regular players, but it is good reading."
3,Mixed feelings,"I already had significant SnG experience before picking up this book, and therefore I don't think I got that much out of it. The book is trying to be a ""how to"" guide, and in that regard is probably pretty decent. It fails however to provide the same level of detail and analysis that Harrington does in his NL texts. It is that underlying knowledge that will ultimately improve one's poker game. If you are starting out, I would still recommend reading Harrington's book to this. The concepts there coupled with experience will ultimately be more beneficial than adopting the basic or advanced Kill Phil strategies advocated in this book."
2,Disappointed,"The sound on this dvd is terrible. The routine isn't bad, it's very NIA, i.e. if you have any NIA workouts you have this - except there's no floorplay, which is a pity. I love the music on the NIA routines, and bought this because of all the reviewers who said the music was awesome. It would be, if you could hear it. Don't know why she didn't include a music only option - this could have been a video, not a dvd, for all the use of its technology. Anyway, even turned up really loud you can only hear her voice. This is going up for trade."
5,Love it!,"This video is full of fun and beautiful dancing. It actually does get the heart rate up too. Chantal is great, and there's plenty of variety. I love to dance, and I like the soulful, earthy feel of her style."
2,Need space and like world music,"I used to dance and I did a lot of aerobics, but this DVD required more space than I have in my apartment. She's fun and it's upbeat, but it wasn't my thing. Too many steps (and I used to dance, surely I should be able to manage that), but that also means you have to pay so much attention to the routines, it hardly is a workout anymore."
5,Great video,I bought this for my mom for Christmas. She is very fit and does a lot of NIA and runs half marathons and still felt like this video kicked her butt. The music is pretty good.
4,I Love to Dance!,"I fell in love with Ana Brett & Ravi Singh's Dance the Chakras Yoga Workout and wanted to find more just like it. This is the closest I've found. I love it. The moves are earthy, easy to do, and fun. Chantal has awesome abs. I would give it 5 stars but the stretching/yoga section was not very good and I like to feel the music pulse through me when I dance and in this one I couldn't turn it up without her voice blasting as well. Overall though, I really love this DVD and will do it again."
5,Joyful sweating,"I'm so glad I bought this DVD. Like a fellow Aussie reviewer, I was looking for something similar to Ana Brett and Ravi Singh's Dance the Chakras. And there are some similarities - barefoot dancing, very accessible dance movements that feel so good to do; wonderful instruction; great music. You'll sweat a lot more with Chantal's workout though because it's very aerobic. At times you may feel like stopping, but the music and dance will compel you to go on.My only complaint (which other reviewers share) is the volume of the music. It's slightly softer than I would have liked.I hope Chantal releases some more DVDs. She's a great instructor and dancer."
5,The best workout video period.,"I was in a crisis; I needed to lose weight and I was desperate. My friends let me borrow all sorts of workout videos and I even wasted money on this stupid Latin dance workout video which wasn't really effective. Finally, I bought ""Soul Sweat"" and before I knew it I was working out with it every other day and even managed to lose some weight too. You have a choice between a 30 or 45 minute and Chantal even has a 20 minute tutorial that shows you each and every one of her dance moves so you don't start a session cold turkey.I hate the gym, and I hate running because it feels like a chore but I'm always excited about ""Soul Sweat"". I love doing it at the end of the day so I can shake off all the tension and get a good night's sleep. ""Soul Sweat"" is definitely not your average workout video buy it now!"
4,Spelling for adult learner,"I am using this book to tutor a Russian immigrant whose spoken English is excellent, but who has no concept of English spelling. The book is very easy to use, progresses logically from one lesson to the next and is well suited to using with older children or adults. It teaches the basic spelling rules, but uses higher level vocabulary and is not childish. It offers clear explanations and a variety of practice exercises. Highly recommended"
5,Plan on using it for my 3rd and 4th grade spelling.,"I have spent my summer reviewing this book and aligning it with the 3rd and 4th grade curriculum I use. I will be using it this school year and think the students will learn much more than memorizing spelling for one week using this curriculum. I am excited and will follow up my review when we get into the school year.Update.. Almost through the year and I love this book. Even my below grade level spellers and resource kids still do the lessons. I am seeing retention of the spelling rules, more word knowledge and students able to justify how and why to spell words. I plan on using this next year and recommending it to be used with upper grade resource kids at my school."
2,Not quite enough,I feel that this is a good curriculum but it seems that there isn't quite enough information and instruction for teaching.
4,a bit more interesting than the usual,"Some interesting info, but still a text. No one would buy this unless he needed to for school. Therefore, there is no point reviewing the item. Teachers will require it, students will buy it. End of story."
5,Bible Breakdown,"This book is really awesome if you need an overview of the bible, and want to understand the heart of its message."
5,Excellent study guide for use in studying the Bible!,An excellent source of reading material when studying or teaching the Scriptures...it gives the reader a powerful overview of God's project.
1,N.T. Wright teachings,"This book accepts teachings by N.T. Wright who denies justification by faith alone, denies that Jesus imputates righteousness, or clothes you with his righteousness."
1,MISLEADING!,"A history and price guide Ha! where's all the tin toys Marx made where's all the Buck Rogers,the Dick Tracy for example where's the beautifully made toy guns? none of that was in this book and when I received it I threw it straight in the bin."
3,Works for my dogs carsickness,"This stuff does help with anxiety, and the ginger & sugar in it help with my dogs nausea in the car.She loved it when she was a puppy, but now isn't crazy about the taste so I mix it with liver powder so she'll eat it."
4,Very good reading,"My daughter and I who were not entirely familiar with the legend of King Arthur, enjoyed this book very much. Although it is a quick overview of Arthur's exploits as well as the adventures of the knights of the round table, it is nontheless captivating. Easy to read and nicely illustrated."
1,King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table (Little Golde,"Being that this is a Little Golden Book and the reading level was listed as 4-8, I assumed that this book would be appropriate for my seven-year-old nephew. However, this book is clearly designed for an older child, both in themes and reading level. Now, I am out my shipping money, and I doubt I'll be ordering from Amazon anytime soon."
5,"Great ideas, stuccato form","Normally a book with this much validity to it should be formed carefully, especially if it will require the reader to reorient his normal thinking pattern. Present the idea, then validate it with research and support. Frequently I found myself headed off the trail when the author gave wrong assumptions or ideas that would later be refuted and invalidated. Dispite the mechanics of the work, the primary suppositions are presented and supported. It will tell you what the human animal thought process is and why spirits, ancestors, and ghosts slip into our cognitive process."
5,"Religion is not a distinct ""thing""","[...]Boyer's work is a very readable version of a growing consensus in the social and even natural sciences--that religion must be approached in a new way since we have been assuming that it was a distinct entity with a distinct source. Boyer and others suggest, rather, that religion is actually a epi-phenomenon of other more mundane interests, tendencies, and capabilities that evolved in humans for quite non-religious reasons.Boyer discusses and supports with empirical field research a variety of these foundations, both cognitive and social. They include the kinds of things we are programmed to attend to and that kinds of ""reasoning"" that we are prone to engage in.[...]"
1,Religion not explained,"I was very disappointed in this book, and not just because it is difficult. I was mainly disappointed because rather than explaining religion, Boyer explained the ""transmission"" of religious beliefs. He explains the influence of ""memes"" (cultural archetypes)on people's beliefs, but he doesn't explain why some people reject them and believe something else."
3,Interesting ideas but Kindle edition has poor print quality.,"The Kindle edition has fuzzy print with parts of letters missing. The pages seem to take longer to turn than other Kindle books, and the footnotes don't work as links, so they're not very useable on Kindle. The ideas seem interesting; I wish the execution had been better. Check the sample to see if you can live with it before buying."
2,Circumstantial,The subject of the book is interesting but the writing style is vague and very circumstantial. What can be said in one sentence is explained in one or several paragraphs and what can be explained in one paragraph is said in a chapter or more. You don't want to put some books down once you piced them up. This book is the opposite; you cannot wait to put it down. It is very boring to read.
4,A serious effort to get to the real roots of religious thinking,"Pascal Boyer goes deep in his effort to explain belief in the supernatural. As a result, some of the reading is a bit dull, but it is ultimately rewarding. He goes well beyond the ""people are a afraid of death"" and ""social approval"" sorts of explanations in his wide-ranging survey of current and historical supernatural beliefs. Most people today take monotheism as the norm, and Boyer shows how and why we got to this point, as religion came to mesh with an increasingly complex web of human intuitions and emotional needs, showing the edifice of religion to be nothing but a cultural artifact."
2,Interesting Topic But Written for PhDs,"Normally I am not a fan of ""dumbed down"" books, but I think this book could greatly benefit from being simplified. Of course, this opinion will appall the intellectuals out there who like this book as is, but the overall message is certainly diluted by the graduate school level philosophical logic arguments. If you are not comfortable with high level logical arguments in detail, I would suggest skipping this book -- it will be too painful to enjoy."
4,The days passed by...,"It is a classic of the 70th of the 20th century, the time of the sexual revolution, the time of the inner liberation, the time the contemporary music is based on.It is no wonder it all happened in San Francisco-A City of Sin.Highly recommended."
4,"OK, even I got grossed out","I don't usually get discomfited by violence and gore in film. The 'Walking Dead' series makes me laugh. But Epitafios is really hard to take unless you can completely rationalize the fact you're watching a film and not real life. I won't go into the gruesome ways the serial killer 'offs' his victims--apparently for revenge that occurred when he was a high school student. But after a while, I just had enough--I found myself wondering what horrible way the killer would find to give his victims their just desserts. The torture the victims endure make the punishments meted out during the Inquistion seem like mild spankings. The only element of this series I enjoyed was a look at the culture of Buenes Aires, which, at least in the series, isn't much different from the gritty, urban world of American cities."
5,Great series.,Excellent price! I looked for this series in stores and prices did not compare...brand new too. Thinking about buying a set for a gift. Timely delivery.
5,Great script better cinema,"Although Epitafios is TV, I would consider it as good cinema. It is compeling and keeps you on in suspense until the end. For the Spanish speakers, although it is filmed in Argentina, the actors don't have the thick argentinian accent and better yet it does not uses argentinian slang that is undecifrable unless you are local. This is good and you won't regret it."
3,CSI Buenos Aires,"I had really high hopes for it since I'd read nothing but positive reviews but in the end it failed to live up to the hype.The main problem is that the writers didn't really have enough materialfor a 13 episode series and as a result many of the episodes were extremely repetitive and predictable.It also suffered from fairly cliched characterization and an extremely unsympathetic lead character in Renzowho's almost unbearably macho.The series does feature a couple of excellent and original subplots/twists, a very interesting characterin Marina Seagal and it also ends very strongly but in the end I have to say that I was disappointed bythis series though I think it might have been quite good as a 7 episode mini."
2,a Can fix,"I was optimistic it would work but a ""Mechanic in a Can"" for a gasket problem is no remedy. We all want the cheap way and I was foolish. Others might feel it solved their engine problems but nothing will help than attacking the problem head on with good parts and proper proceedure"
5,Beautiful Book,"This is probably the most beautiful and well executed book I have had the pleasure of experiencing. I collect art and this is truly a work of art. It harks back to the children's books of the past such as Dulac. I will enjoy this book for years to come and recommend it to all who can appreciate great art and a great storyteller, that is Mr. Anderson."
5,A Wonderful Archetypal Study,"This is a story of spiritual awakening as the Little Mermaid moves from a position of unconsciousness to one of consciousness thence to spiritual enlightenment. This is a story of transformation and of true mercy. Despite some of the less than palatable archetypal symbols, such as her losing her tongue, this book, like all faery tales, should be inspirational to all readers who seek to find meaning beyond the story in its literary sense. Truely understanding this and other faery tales will assist the reader to transcend this mundane world and discover new insight and understanding on a higher plane. Without this understanding, we are all simply unconscious.On an aesthetic level, the watercolours are well executed. This would make a perfect gift."
1,"very scarey and upsetting book, even for adults.",This fairy tale is full of violence. The little mermaid has her tongue cut out by the sea witch as payment for her legs. It also talks about the little mermaid stabbing the prince and having his blood pour over her feet to get her a tail back. Book also dwells heavily on death. Even the illustrations are not appropriate for children.
1,The Little Mermaid By Rachel Isadora,"This book is horrible! I would not read this book ever again. I found this book in the younger kids section at the library, I was planning to read this book to my younger cousin. Then I read the book to see what it was like and I think this book should go in the young adult section. This book is so sad. I would not reccomend this book to anyone!"
1,"Disappointing, especially for the price","I have been using this feeder for less than 3 months in a mild climate. Today I found it on the ground because the wood split where the hanger was screwed in. Because of the multi-directional splits, there is no way to screw the hanger back in. I can probably find some way to wire it up with a new hanger, but I shouldn't have to for this price. The top is not flat as it appears in the picture; it actually has an angle cut in each side, so the hanger is screwed into the top of the inverted V. I liked the natural aspect of this feeder, but I wouldn't buy another one."
4,Most Enjoyable!,"Overall, todays music all sounds alike to me. Mostly what sets them apart is their costumes. Lady GaGa outdoes them all but her voice is no more distinctive than anyone elses. I have been trying out different genres of music and have found a treasure trove of choices on Amazon. III Tyme Out is one of those treasures. Russell Moore, the lead singer has an amazing voice. Try something from genres you would have never checked out otherwise. You might be pleasantly surprised. I know I am."
4,does the job well,"For the purpose of studying for the Solaris 8 Administrator exams, I found this book (and accompanying CD) very helpful. I am an experienced administrator, and the format of the book allowed me to breeze past chapters and concepts I was already comfortable with and focus on those concepts that I had little or no experience with (e.g. NIS, cachefs). In those chapters I focused on, I found enough material to be comfortable answering questions on that topic in the exams.If nothing else, buy the book for the accompanying CD. It includes practice exams and study questions with a very similar feel and content to the actual exams. It also includes the entire book (which is quite thick) in PDF format, so you can read and work through the examples right on your computer.I did find many errors (some typos, some in content), but cetainly not enough to get very frustrated with the book. (And unfortunately, not any more errors than other technical books I read of similar size)."
5,Excellent follow up.....,"Bill Calkins has written another solid Training guide, to help in preparing for the Solaris 8 Sys Admin Exams. This guide is jammed packed with good solid technical information, which will go a long way in helping you prepare for that all important exams, not only is this an excellent support guide for the exams, but an excellent reference book that will stay on your desk, long after you've passed, well done Bill!"
2,Book did exactly what it promised,"It covered everything needed to get top scores on the 2 tests. Using the book, I pulled a 92% on 011, and 95% on 012.Didn't use the CD.It's not a SysAdmin reference book, it's a training guide to pass the 2 tests to get Solaris SA 8 certified.I plan on using Bill's SA 9 book to ace the upgrade test."
1,You will fail the exam if you rely on this book,"My first impression of this book is - what exam am I studying for? I mean, the material from Exam I and Exam II is just crammed in together. This approach is ignorant at best. The index is completely wrong, so how am I supposed to find anything useful?"
4,The update to Bills Solaris 7 training guide,"A good book if you need some help getting prepared for the Solaris 8 exam and cannot afford to go to the Sun education class. Bill does a solid job organizing the material needed for the exam.The testing software is ok, not great, but ok. If you buy the extra questions you get a whole lot of duplicates.Complaints aside, this book stands head and shoulders above the rest of the Solaris 8 admin prep books that are out there. And hey, I passed the Part 2 exam (I had passed the part 1 during the beta)."
1,DEFINITELY NOT FOR CERTIFICATION,After buying this book I realized I wont get certified in the next five years if I had used it for the exam. I dont know if this is a good Solaris book or not; but IT IS NOT A CERTIFICATION PREPARATION BOOK. THERE ARE SOME CHAPTERS IN THE BOOK NOT EVEN MENTIONED IN THE OBJECTIVES. I used the EXAM CRAM book and passed both exams in just two weeks. I dont have any sys admin experience at all.SO STAY AWAY FROM THIS BOOK UNLESS U HAVE A LOT OF TIME TO KILL.
2,Not on my top ten list,"In fairness to this book, I did not get this book to prepare for the Solaris Admin exams. But I did want a good solaris specific administrator reference. Towards that end, this book is a failure in my opinion. Many of the items listed in the index are found many pages from that indicated in the index or when found skirt the info I was looking for.In closing, to those of you considering this book as a study guide, you should be aware that the 'highly recommended' accompanying CD can only be run on a M$ windows box. That speaks more to me about the intended audience."
3,A good starting point for beginners,"Programming with the Lotus Notes C++ API is thankfully much easier than using the Lotus Notes C API. The Notes C++ API classes mirror the LotuScript classes so one you get used to programming in C++, the code follows a similar path to LotusScript code. The Notes C++ API can do a large amount of what the Lotus Notes C API can do but for some tasks you still need the Notes C API.This book is an ok starting point for complete beginners, especially if you are new to Lotus Notes and/or the C++ API. If you have never called a DLL then you should probably read this book. But you may find that you move beyond the book quite quickly.You may also want to consider ""LotusScript to Lotus C API Programming Guide"" [...]"

4,Good Book,"This book helps a lot. I was not use to using the command prompt continuously, but it definately helps beginners."
4,Decent book.,"Does the trick in a quick pinch. If you are looking for a more advanced guide, this book is not for you."
4,Great little pocket guide,"I'm a novice when it comes to linux, and don't have a lot of time to invest in learning it. This guide has been very helpful to understand the basic commands and be able to navigate in the linux environment."
3,Not for beginners,"While this may be an excellent reference for experienced Linux users, it will be of very limited use for beginners or those who use Linux through a graphical interface. It is also specifically directed towards Fedora. It would be helpful if your descriptive blurb on the book revealed these two facts."
5,Most-used book in my Linux library,"I was a novice Linux administrator as of 4 months ago, having spent 10 years administering NT/2000 only. I needed to get up to speed fast on the command line, and this provided exactly what I needed -- quick and dirty references on what to do when.There's nothing more frustrating than knowing precisely what you're going to do, and it's simple as all heck, but you just don't know the blasted command in Linux. This got me past this phase so that I no longer had to ask silly questions of my peers. Certainly worth it.--tgr"
3,the alternative for man in console,well if u want a book for read in non computers moment and want start with linux os like fedora or similars distros this is a good way to start
4,Worthwhile reading for beginners and advanced users,"I've been using Linux since 1996, and this book still gave me some new tips and information to make better use of my Linux system."
5,Very good!,"It's the best entry point to learn how to fight with your linux and shell. With the new Fedora 10, why don't think in a 2nd edition?"
3,technical,I was looking for a small form linux for dummies. This manual was too technical for me. It may be of use for me down the road.
5,Just as title promises.,"This is a well rounded guide that gets right to the point and serves its purpose well. With easily referenced material/subjects (that goes into even more detail when needed), you will likely find everything you'll need using in this one book, without the need for a 'bible' with a lot of discussions that are ultimately irrelevant to the information you seek. A definite for a beginner, and a good reminder or reference on some subjects you may not have touched on over the years for those with experience. And, for the size, this book has a lot and touches on many topics. Well formatted and easy to follow. Recommended."
1,Not Retail Packaging,"I received an OEM ink cartridge with a warranty expiration date that was from 2010 (2 years expired). My HP Photosmart 8150 printer displayed ink cartridge has failed and would not print with this cartridge installed. Amazon did process my return and refund promptly, but beware of this item from this seller."
5,Great Addition to HP PS2610,This is a great addition to photo printers that will support this cartridge. This is my 3rd cartridge of this model and all have performed flawlessly in my HP PhotoSmart Model 2610 printer.
1,very disappointed,"I have not installed this product in my printer as of yet and not sure that I will. I can not yet say the quality of the prints I get with this cartridge, but I can say that I was extremely diappointed in the packaging of this product. It looked like some one opened the box, tossed it aside and stuck a sticker on the outside of the package that claimed it was original package. I am not sure if this is a redo or an original HP product. I am trying to decide if it is worth trying or returning. I would be very careful ordering this product. I wish I had investigated the reviews a little more on this one. I can usually count on the reviews to help in decision making. I guess, you get what you pay for. Very disappointing and misleading product advertisement. If the company is not going to ship it in original packages than that should be made perfectly clear to the purchaser."
1,Not retail package in picture,"The package is OEM with a sticker applied that says ""Retail Package."" I wonder if this is the remanufactured version of the cartridge? I won't be able to tell if it's genuine until my current cartridge runs out and I install this one."
1,HP Photo Cartirdge 99,"I was very disappointed in this photo cartridge. The photos printed with a purple hue and the color quality was the same as my regular tri-color cartridge. When talking to a sales clerk at office Max, I was informed that it was probably a refurbished ink cartridge and was not compatible with my HP Photosmart printer."
5,incredibly fast shipping!,I can't really write a review about this seller's product (an inkjet cartridge) because I haven't used it yet and may not for a while but I was VERY impressed with the speed of the delivery. I think it took one whole day! Very nice!
4,Pure and Simple,"Carol Elizabeth Jones and James Leva deliver traditional country/folk music with a simple yet soulfully rich ease that brings comfort and a sense of timelessness to the listener. Their brand of tradition is in no way confining. The music is fresh and alive, but in an easy and unforced way.And most important of all - the melding of their vocals is wonderfully enlivening and emotive. If the voice is the mirror of the heart and soul, in these two reside the gift of simplicity coexisting with the complexities of lives lived fully. In these voices, music and song live the timeless depths of a rich geographical and cultural region anchored to the cadence of Nature. This recording is a treasure."
5,Absolutely everything I was looking for!,"This case covers the screen, does not cover the click wheel, has a cool flip-down bottom so you can access the port and lock, and it even allows the ipod to fit on the newer logitech speaker dock without removing the case! On the older logitech I had to remove the case, but it is awesome nonetheless, and the price is right!"
5,Great piece of equipment,This stethoscope came in prestine condition and works wonderfully. It has extra pieces for long term use. I would recommend this to any student or professional.
3,Michael Ironside and Colin Ferguson face giant crocs in this 3rd installment...,"Lake Placid was a fun, humorous film when it was released in 1999. It was followed in 2005 by the made-for-TV Lake Placid 2, which starred John Schneider and Cloris Leachman. It was entertaining, but it didn't really compare to the first.Now, Lake Placid 3 surfaces and it fares about the same as the second entry. The special effects are about what you would expect from a Sci-Fi channel film. The storyline is actually fairly good, however. It involves the grandson of Leachman from the 2nd film, played by Eureka star Colin Ferguson, and his attempts to kill the crocodiles after it begins to kill off the elk population in his quiet Maine town. Along for the ride are Yancy Buter (of Witchblade) and the great Michael Ironside (as the rough and tough sheriff.)It's not a bad film. It is sure entertaining and it is a fun way to kill a couple of hours if you have nothing else to do."
3,CROCODILE ROCK,"Some irrelevant observations about LAKE PLACID 3:*Colin Ferguson looks like a skinny Mark Valley*Kirsty Mitchell looks like Amelia Heinle's (Young and Restless) younger sister*Yancy Butler looks like a hardened Sharon Stone.Now with that out of the way, is the movie any good?It's fun and delivers the requisite blood, dead bodies and even some frontal nudity and even Michael Ironside in a rare good guy role as the sheriff. The FX are appropriately cheesy and Butler is a hoot. Horror fans should enjoy."
2,The Unrated version isn't much better than the rated one,"I rented this from a local Redbox, only to discover it was the rated version. So I kept looking for the Unrated and, I can tell you, the added nudity (which is plentiful) and a few extra scenes of gore don't make this movie any better. It's saving grace is an over-the-top performance by Yancy Butler, but that's it. Even Micheal Ironside phoned this one it.Avoid at all costs, unless you're a big Yancy Butler fan. She's terrific, but you'll see the same performance in the rated version."
2,Fake Rancid 3 is more like it.,"What a steaming pile of Crocodile doo this is. If I would have looked it up before I spent my $1.00 at the rent box I would have passed on it. But I get to the rent box and this hobo is talking to him self, blowing cigarette smoke down his blouse and turning slowly in circles so I am sure to see he has a pretty pink skirt on over his black stained up jogging pants. I also note the big jumbo shoe tassels he has made from what may have been bloody rags tied to his shoe strings. Anyway I was in a big hurry to get away from my new buddy so I just picked the first thing I saw on the monitor. If you ever have a doubt about how bad of an actress Yancy Butler is please see this fine film, she is so stunningly lame it is worth a look.Michael Ironside can be the kiss of death for any movie but trust me he is the highlight of this flick.C.G.I. ha ha , you must see it to believe it. I had fun just pointing and mocking this movie from start to end."
1,Terrible movie,"Somebody questioned why my reviews are so negative, the answer is I usually only write a review when a movie is so bad it prompts me to pass it on to others so maybe they can avoid wasting their time watching it. This movie is so stupid I don't know where to start. Everyone in it acts as stupid as possible, I ask can people really be that stupid? The answer is yes! Anyone who thinks this movie is worth watching fits into that category. What is the world coming to? The best part of this movie was it finally ended. They should make DVD's recyclable so I don't feel so bad when I throw it away because I certainly won't dump this piece of crap onto anyone else."
3,lake Placid I ordered for someone else,I don*t care for the violence in this movie and I ordered it for someone else--if they like it then that is their opinion
2,Don't Fall for the Hype,"The main characters in this novel, April and Ryan, are the two most shallow characters I've ever encountered in romantic fiction. They have absolutely no depth. And for more than the first half of the book, it was a struggle, not to put this book down, but to continue on with it. Pretty darned boring. It picks up in the second half but when you're finished reading it, you'll realize you couldn't have cared less about either of them through the entire story. These two are so completely self-centered that the only reason they could possibly love each other is because they're exactly alike. Well, actually, April does commit a selfless act in the end. It's not that they're not likeable. They're really rather innocently shallow. The book has its humorous moments and one or two emotional rushes but, overall, it just makes you wonder why you bothered. Don't bother."
4,A captivating life,"Diane, is honest and therefor takes the reader on an invaluable journey. Her hard work and inspiration, also gave the reader a message to create your own dream into a reality."
5,Inspiring,"I absolutely loved this book and finished it in 2 days. Diane is real, honest and candid about her life and inspires women to be women!"
1,What a waste of paper.,"Zero stars would be a more appropriate rating.I agree this book is full of false information. Don't waste your money. I paid $2 for this book at a discount book store and I felt that it was money wasted.There are many great pregnancy and birth books out there that are actually based on factual information. They give the pros and cons to many of the interventions that are commonly used in obstetrics today. How can a woman make the decision that is right for her if she is not presented with ALL the facts?I will recommend a few books that are worth your money.Pregnancy, Childbirth, and the Newborn by Simkin, Whaley, KepplerTHe Birth Book by Dr. SearsThe Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth by Henci Goer (this may be a little to the anti-epidural side of the scale, but at least her statements are factual)"
3,"Pregnancy advice good, but labor and delivery not so good.","The advice about labor basically is that she doesn't understand why anyone would ""give birth"" without an epidural. The whole view point obviously is from an ob who is not into any natural ways at all. I wasn't looking for a naturalistic approach only, but this book was a bit over the top on how labor is going to hurt like crazy! Not very inspiring!"
1,Horrible...,As a nurse I was appalled when I read this book. Dr. Brasner sounds like most other OBs out there - big headed and full of herself. I would encourage women to do their own research on the interventions such as epidurals and continuous fetal monitoring. Most of what Dr. Brasner says in this book is lies. Sad...
1,Brasner's philosophy of birth,"Brasner's philosophy of childbirth is summed up nicely in a passage that challenges the skeptisicm around the wipespread use of epidurals (""God's gift to women""). She compares giving birth to having your appendix removed. Would you refuse the help of the anesthesiologist before your appendectomy?If you think that pregnancy is a disease, and your idea of a 'good' birth is one where an expert on identifying and treating disease eradicates the disease as quickly and painlessly as possible (even if it means cutting it out of you) then this may be the book for you! If you think that childbirth is a sacred and completely normal (for most women) physiological process, and that women's bodies are quite capable of doing what it is that our bodies are designed to do-- then you might want to choose another book."
2,Doesn't live up to the title,"The auther has a lot to tell about how to shoot great pictures. There are also quite a few great pictures to illustrate this.What's sorely lacking, however, is examples (both written and in pictures) of what exactly happens, or could happen, if you get things wrong. For instance, the auther tells us that the relation between subject, foreground and background has to be correct. What's missing is examples of common mistakes made in that regard, preferrable on the same subject (as in a right/wrong example)."
5,KEYBOARD CHORD COMPUTER,"EASY TO USE CHORD COMPUTER. ALMOST A MANDATORY REQUIRED ACCESSORY FOR PLAY PIANO IN A FLASH COURSE. SO MUCH EASIER THAN LOOKING THROUGH PAGES AND PAGES OF CHORDS TO FIND CHORD YOU'RE LOOKING FOR. SO SMALL, YOU CAN PUT RIGHT ON PIANO WHILE YOU'RE PLAYING."
4,Great learning/writing tool!,"The Snarling Dog's Chord Computer is great! The only thing I would change is having the unit PLAY the sound of the chord you are choosing. Other than that, its a tremendous writing/learning tool. I have been a bassist for years and dabbled with keyboards, but lost my old Chord Computer, so this was a replacement unit. At this point, I have decided to go serioously into teaching myself to play piano fluently, which is why it was prime time to get a new unit. THANKS!"
3,Solid Meter,"Pros: The meter does what it's designed to do. Can't count how many times I've dropped this thing and it still works as good as the day I bought it. Pretty rugged casing. Big digital display. I like the little pop-out stand.Cons: Seems that it's a little susceptible to skewed readings if you're moving compared to some other meters that do the same thing. And as a paranormal investigator, I am often on the move while taking readings. Wish this thing had a faster sample rate, as it's only 1 update per second. No back-light is a downer.Overall, this was the first EMF meter I bought, and I still use it on all my paranormal investigations. It's a solid meter, just as the title states. The only downers are simply due to it being a basic, one-use meter. If you're in the need for an average priced EMF meter that's going to stand up to some abuse, I'd recommend this one. However, if you have a slightly larger budget, you might look into some other options with nicer features."
1,Ineffective meter,The information on this meter is inaccurate. There is no external sensor to allow for accurate measurement. The slightest movement will give different readings. I returned this item.
4,Great meter,"This is a great little meter; solid and well-made. I use it for measuring EMF around the house. The reason I don't give it 5 stars is that it doesn't come with any information about how to use it - I have used an EMF meter before so I know what kind of fields to expect, the need to rotate the meter sometimes to catch the fields, and etc. But if I didn't already know this, it would be a problem. The meter also has an ELF setting and I don't know anything about that."
4,Wonderful product,I found a lot of problem areas in my home. This is a useful tool to have around the house. Dont move it too fast while using it or jar it against anything or you will get a false high reading.
4,The Real Deal,Stuart McRobert gives a lot of tips on how to train right. If you are working out at the gym and you are not getting the gains you want; buy this book!Many poeple over train thier bodies and do not grow. This book puts weight lifting into perspective. If you need a fresh view on how to train smart - this is it.
5,I laughed out loud!,"This was a really fun, easy read - VERY funny and with a surprising and hopeful ending. I want to know what happens next with Gloria."
5,Dirty Tricks,"Great Book! I've been entertained over the past few days with Dirty Tricks. It is well written - and funny. The engaging characters remain true to life - in spite of their quirks. I felt as though I might encounter any of them at a political gathering, and, with Rita Bleiman's insight, I might even know whom to avoid and whom to engage.The writing, the plot, and the characters held my interest. I was chuckling a good bit of the time, that is, when I wasn't examining upside-down Jefferson nickels (you'll need to read the book to understand the reference!)"
3,A little dated,"Honestly, this book could use a face-lift. It's a little dated, a little old. It gives some good advice, but perhaps could use a more interesting way to present it. And it didn't help me too much with the decision of if we should committ to the second child. I suppose nothing can do that but us...."
2,Boring,This book makes a nightmare out of having a second child. I know it's suppose to prepare you but this book took it to the next extreme...
2,Acceptable Common Sense Primer with Examples,"This book backs up common sense with anecdotes and examples from real life parents in a wide variety of second-child situations (ranging from closs-in-age to far apart, 2-child and 3,4-child familes...). Unfortunately, I found most of the points it made were just that, and that if you were a conscientious parent who studied and tried hard with your first child, you would already have known most of what was in here. If you're looking for a primer that doesn't talk down to you the way many first-time parenting books do, this is a quick and fair read. If you're looking for new examples and things you haven't heard before, there are better books than this one."
4,Great book!,"I bought when we were thinking about baby #2 and I must say it was useful for me. Sure, it won't give you any miracle recipe to a peaceful family life but it will guide your reflection about what are the possible pitfalls and what you can do to avoid them. I'm glad I read it before conceiving our next child."
