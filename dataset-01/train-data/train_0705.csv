2,.,"I have issues with Current 93, so ... don't take this as the review of a fan. I *am* all for odd, experimental collage work--which is exactly what In Menstrual Night is. No songs here ... not really ... just 3 very long, weird tracks that sound like a sea of lo-fi voices and samples. Personally, though, I found the atmosphere of the whole thing dull and bleak. I'm actively interested in recordings like these, but I could find no way to get into the work here. It just didn't strike me as compelling listening in any way. Challenging, perhaps, but only in the worst sense of the word. Maybe worth a listen or two, but ... it isn't really worth the import price. Unless you're a C93 fan and the idea of listening to lo-fi vocal samples murmur arbitrarily for an hour or more just tickles you silly."
1,way out of date,"At one point this might have been a useful book, but it's dated and not all that useful in today's fast-changing market. Where's the reference to day trading?"
2,Two years out of date with technology,"With the advance in investing software and the development of internet sites which specialize in charts, quote, portfolio tracking and news, this book is out of date. All of the software reviewed in the book is also out of date by about two years."
1,Poor Customer Service,"This product arrived damaged in the mail. The company was contacted about the issue, but I have not received any response after nearly two (2) months."
4,NEW TO SKA - PREFER SKANIC,"Love the horn. Crisp sound from all in the band. These guys are definitely outside of the box, and exceptional artists."
3,Good- But A Poor Follow-up,"I was suprised to see a San Diego-native ska group sign to a major ska label like moon ska(the ska version of Epitaph). I purchased the Last Call, but I was disappointed because their original release(which was only 9 songs) was soooooo much better and a lot cheaper. Eight of the nine original release songs are on the Last Call. Only a couple are of the standard of the original releases. The singers(they use more than one) sing differently but with similar arrangement. I advice this disc only to the avid Skanic fan as my self. If you are looking for a good third-wave ska group that isn't super popular, (...) buy their original release (...).On this album, the best songs are: track 1: Eyesore(which is off the original) 2:Breed (a Nirvana cover) 3:Song #13(new song)All the songs are decent but these are the best."
2,Annoying,"The book opens well, but quickly falters. The heroine, at 24, still acts like a teenager for the first 1/3 of the book. Then the villaness arrives, and Emily becomes a self-esteem basket case. Jacob is, at best, a mediocre hero. He's blind (figuratively), obstinate, and a taker. Lane makes the mistake of telling us what the characters are like rather than revealing them by their words and actions. The latter rarely match her descriptions. Some might say that her characters are flawed, but I found them unsavory (except Richard and Sophie). Yes, a good villaness, but it's hard to believe she got away with all she did. So often, I just couldn't believe that things happened as they did, or that so many characters were so clueless -- and repeated the same mistakes so often. Lane even threw in extraneous obstacles that had no basis in the story. One at the end, in particular, is suddenly held up -- out of nowhere -- as a possible reason for Emily to refuse Jacob. Bizarre."
3,"Flimsy, but you are getting what you pay for","Wings are flimsy rubber. They are not solid wings, but like rubber curtains hanging from thick wire rods. That said, they look nice when you're not bumping into things with them. You can bend and reshape the wire frame to a degree, so you can point the wings straight back, fold them, or have them pointing straight out to the sides."
3,"Good, but not what I expected, or what I am into","I also own Ecolecua and Money Pa'que. In those albums the band had utilized a combination of rock with latin influences. They used trombones, accordions, congas, and whatever else fit, and I loved it. Not this one, they cut out the musicians to just just guitar, bass, and drums. The sound is pure modern rock'n'roll. So if you enjoyed their previous rock latin fusion, you may be dissapointed like I was."
4,Easy to use,These shears work well. I like the swivel feature. I would recommend these to anyone looking for hand held grass shears.
2,Better for paper than thicker grass,"I found these grass shears to be too lightweight to handle the heavier bunches of grass. Bunches just bent as the blades just separated because they are so thin. I returned them, and will go on the lookout for the traditional shears, those with heavier blades."
1,"Side Screw Holding Blades together, Stripped Out !","While I have purchased Fiskars products in the past and loved them, these shears broke on the second time out. The side screw holding the blades together are mounted in plastic, the screw came loose, so the blades did not touch each other. When trying to tighten the screw into the plastic base, IT STRIPPED!These have to be the WORST garden shears that I have ever owned, or should I say briefly owned, as they are in the Trash!Gardena (German Made) are much better then the Fiskars, and way better then the Chinese made cheap versions that you find locally in your Big Box Stores."
2,A terrible choice!,Fiskars could have done a lot better with these shears! They pinch your hands and don't cut worth a hoot!
3,Too weak to cut through thick grass,"Good shears with the rotating head and nice grip to it, have trouble cutting through thicker grass though it seems the plastic has too much ""give"" so it flexes. No problems cutting through the grass blades, but if you want to cut through the thicker parts nearer to the roots look for something more sturdy."
1,Broke in 3 Months,"It was working good like Fiskars products usually do, and then the right blade broke where the connecting post fits in. It did this just trimming the edge of my grass where my lawnmower misses.My conclusion is that this should not have happened except for a manufacting defect in the metal or how it was assembled. A previous review states theirs has been working great for over 3 years. Well, sorry to mess up this products 5 star rating; but the truth is Fiskars needs better quality control for this product."
2,"Lightweight, so you can throw them far when they pinch you!","These could not have been tested by humans before they were sold to the public. You have three choices of where to place your thumb while cutting grass. On top of the handle, where you cannot maintain a good grip, right on the locking button, whereby you are constantly locking them while trying to cut, and thirdly, below the button where a nasty blood blister awaits you when you pinch the crap out of your digits.On the positive side, (which earns the 2nd star), they have a very light action, and they're lightweight, so you can throw them into your worst neighbor's yard and let them get the crap pinched out of them.Pass on these, please."
3,Works good except for the blood blisters!,"You best wear gloves with these as they tend to pinch your palm as your cutting. Other than that, they stay sharp for a very long time and cut very well."
4,Makes the Cut,"Though I have several string trimmers, there are areas best cut by hand - like around the vines climbing the two metal arbors out front. If I accidentally cut those vines, I'll be in big trouble, and so when trimming around those long babied vines I use the Fiskars grass shears.The shears cut well through grass though thick woody stems can stop them in their tracks. The up and down handle mechanism is comfortable and doesn't cramp my hands like some of the side to side units. I like using these when trimming around the Virginia creepers and any prized flowers that I don't want to harm.After three years the shears still cut well, and though I only use them a few times a year, they're a great tool to have in the garden shed when the need arises. I've noticed that my pair doesn't close all the way when put in the locked position. That has never been a problem.Would I but these black and orange (Oriole colors) shears again? Most definitely."
3,"REO, the Breakthrough Album","The release of ""Hi Infidelity"" catapulted Illinois garage rockers REO Speedwagon (briefly) to the top of the rock and roll sales heap. In the early 1980s, songs from this record were inescapable on the radio. The biggest successes were the prototypical power ballads ""Take it on the Run,"" and ""Keep on Loving You."" The more rocking opening cut ""Don't Let Him Go,"" was also a hit. The rest are truly a dated sounding mixed bag, featuring such items as the middling do-wop of ""In Your Letter"" and the truly laughable lyrics of ""Tough Guys."" For the most part, REO was Styx without the showmanship. Both bands would see their fan base evaporate quickly during the 1980s after huge successes early in the decade.Overall, if you're a big fan you'll love this album. Everyone else would be better off with one of REO's greatest hits albums instead."
3,A Good Album,"The rest of the album is enjoyable, but the 45's that came out it are great. ""I Just Want To Keep On Loving You"" is a CLASSIC & worth the price of the album alone! I believe this is the best REO Speedwagon has put out."
1,Double Gag,"Truly, one of the worst recordings I've ever heard. It's amazingly appropriate this was the soundtrack to my high school days. Both were awful. Then comes college, a much richer experience, and a great band like REM was the soundtrack. I'd rather have my toenails pulled out one by one than listen to this drivel."
3,"A very good album but not a ""magnific album""","I didn't know this album and yet I bought it. I heard the song ""Keep on loving you"" on a compilation. This song is very good all as ""Don't let him go"". After, there are 2 or 3 songs ""easylistening"" as ""Follow my heart"" and ""Take it on the run"". To conclude, this album is a good investissement."
3,#1 Album for 15 weeks in 1981,"Not a reason to buy this CD. There is one good reason to buy this CD. The lead track ""Don't Let Him Go"" that song brings out everything REO was good for. Let me first start by saying that I love almost everything recorded by the likes of Journey, Styx and Kansas so arena rock can be down right cool at times. I also love 90% of the ballads that those bands did. The ballads on Hi Infidelity are just plain forced. I don't feel any emotion comming across on songs such as ""Take it on the Run"" or ""Keep on Loving You"" Kevin Cronin doesn't have near the voice as Dennis DeYoung, Tommy Shaw or Steve Perry.Overall. This CD has a few good tracks, but there are so many better bands in this gerne that were better musician and put out much better records"
1,Is this Genuine?????,The bill advertised has an imprint on the back side of the currency. My researh indicates that this type of bill does not have $100.00 printed on the rear. The sellers need to verify whether or not this is a genuine bill.
1,Gateway and Dell are worth it,"I hate to say it, but Gateway and Dell are worth the extra money. Even with their pain in the neck propriety parts.I've had my Presario for a year (warranty ran out Monday). It's sluggish, locks up, shows umteen errors and constantly shuts down programs.There is an error message for Nvida graphics card that keeps telling me to upgrade. The computer does not come with Nvida graphics card. After 40 minutes on hold trying to get help from Compaq.......they tell me that it is a SOFTWARE ISSUE.I hate to spend the extra $300 but we had our Gateway for 5 years with minimal trouble and my mom's had Dell happily for a couple years.This computer is going to the kids!"
5,"This is a ""must have"" reference for any dressmaker.","Nancy has done it again. Her CLEAR ILLUSTRATIONS and EASY TO FOLLOW LANGUAGE demystify the alteration process. Until the pattern industry agrees to make patterns that fit REAL bodies instead of that mythical 5'8"" 100-pound form, Ms. Zieman's book will be invaluable. I've been sewing for about 40 years. Until I read this book, I always wondered why my patterns never quite fit when I followed the measuring guidelines on the pattern envelopes. It wasn't me, it was the pattern's miscalculations! Nancy tells us how to determine the actual pattern size to purchase (and it ain't the one recommended on the envelope!) Then, she meticulously takes us through the steps required to modify the purchased pattern to ourselves. I used this book to resize a princess style bodice to a prospective bride with a double-D bust. I would not have attempted the changes without Zieman's careful and beautifully illustrated advice."
5,Only book to buy for solving fitting problems,Never could get patterns to fit right until I bought this book and tried Nancy's method of pivot and slide. First item I made was a jacket and it fit perfectly. Her directions are clear and easy to follow. Her pictures complement her instructions very well
2,"Sounded great, but didn't work for me","I thoroughly enjoyed reading Nancy's book, and it sounded as though it would be the perfect answer for my fitting problems. But, when I tried to utilize her techniques, nothing fit at all. It was a big disappointment."
5,Nancy is a great teacher!,I have learned more about sewing from her than anyone else. She explains everything perfectly in her book. I have used it extensively. It is good for beginners or even people who have been sewing a long time but just need a reminder about some things. I highly recommend this book!
2,D` Artagnion Duck Breasts,"My reveiw would be poor, since I didn`t realize the ""portion"" of food I purchased was half the size of a dollar bill!It tasted great but the size was ridiculous!"
5,Excellent Theoretical Framework!!,"This book is not an easy reading, but provides an excellent framework for research and promotion of public policies related to Regulation."
2,Not very durable,"The palm is padded, but the trims which are not padded get ripped very easily. Better to take craftman's mechanic gloves and cut the tips off. However, for seven dollars I bought a few, but expecting to last not very long.Overall, these are not very durable but for the cheap price, they still make a good addition as work gloves."
5,Another great CD From a great band,"I'm not much of a fan of the whole ""punk"" genre, but I've been a fan of Amen since I heard Snot's ""Get Some"" the first time; And ever since then, I've kept my ears and eyes open for a new album from them. It's taken a bit of time, but here it is, and it's definitely worth the $12. The CD stays true to their low-fi sound, with grinding guitars and biting social commentary from Casey Chaos; I don't know where anyone would get that amen is one person, with a touring band-- there are credits for a whole band in the liner notes, but opinions aside, this CD is worth your money if you're willing to subject yourself to something as brutish and solid as Amen."
3,"B&B not ""covered""",Good day to you.... I was disappointed upon opening my package and discovering a seven inch ripin the cover of the book. Unusual part is that theplastic covering the book was intact!!!! And the bookitself was also undamaged. So the book was actually sent to me with a damaged cover. Very disconcerting and the first time that I have ever received anythingdamaged from Amazon. The book is wonderful and so arethe memories. For that I thank you!!!!! So... do youhave another cover?Thank you so much for your timeAlex Alejandro
1,The worst archive that DC has put out,The art and Bob Haneys stories make this just pablum. I remember been 14 and thinking its got a few good stories in each issue but when taken all at once and for the price your money is better spent elsewhere. The Classic B & The B were The Viking Prince and the Silent Knight. Regretfully this isn't the classic in fact its far from it :(
4,Very Pleased,This book had been recommended to me and it was just what I needed. I received it quickly and appreciate the good service.
4,"Very nice saw, but don't go nuts with it....","This saw is really cool. Very sharp and fast cutter. I used it for about two years and got good use out of it. The tri shaped teeth really work.Couple of points I didn't like - sometimes when I was going really hard with it, the blade would slide back into the handle. Also, at one point, it got caught in a branch and actually bent. I was still able to use it after the bend, but not as easily.Now I lost the saw but miss it. I would like to get one like it that is a wee bit more sturdy and perhaps a bit longer. But for portability and occassional use, this one may be just what you want."
2,Blade snapped in half while using - literally doens't make the cut!,"Nice idea but unlike the majority of Fiskars products, this one literally doesn't make the cut. Have owned for about a year but only use occassionally - typically for small branches. When doing some trimming yesterday the blade snapped right in half about an inch from the base of the blade - ie, the larger part of the blade. Quality simply isn't there and is not up to par with other Fiskar products. Very good for small branches - don't rely on it for thicker ones."
3,I hate it when negative reviews are right!,"Yea, I did see the reviews about the lack of sound quality from others that purchased this CD, but I thought, how bad could it be - it's a CD. Well, to me, it was pretty noticeable. I added this to my iPod, along with my other "" store bought ""CD's of Bob Seger that I own, and there is a definite difference in sound quality. This must be a copy, of a copy, squared! I tried to download it from iTunes, but it is not available there. At some point, I will dig out my old vynil album and load it that way. I'm sure it will sound better than this. Gave three stars because it arrived as advertised, and I was warned about the quality beforehand."
2,"Poor ""Remaster""","I love this album. Growing up it was one of my favorite to listen to. When I saw it was remastered I got really excited. However, I agree with an earlier reviewer that the sound quality is poor. Either it wasn't remastered or they did a lousy job. I own over 400 CDs and I'd say this is in the bottom 10% in terms of sound quality."
4,I've got four words for you: Shame on the Moon,"I really only like a couple of songs on here, but I bought the album for Shame on the Moon, which is, I must say, absolutely magnificent. I like to make mixed tape dubs for my friends and that song is one I put on every tape. So I give ""The Distance"" 4 stars based mainly on Shame and Roll Me Away, which makes me want to jump on my motorcycle and head toward the sunset every time I hear it. Good job, Bob!"
3,Very poor musically,"I've bought the vinyl LP version of this album, because someone had recommended it to me.I'm not a Bob Seger's fan, but I found the music of this album much too simple, ""déjà vu"", and pretty boring for me who is usually into progressive rock.I nevertheless gave 3 stars, because I might not be very objective to judge this sort of music, and I don't want to make Bob's fans too angry.Simply put, I could not believe my eyes when seeing this record had an average rating of more than 4 stars, so wanted to correct a little bit this."
2,Remastered really stinks,"When I saw the 2011 remastered version of Bob Seger The Distance I was excited to get this. What a disappointment. This cd is definitly not remastered.No comparison to early seger vol. 1 ,live bullet and nine tonight. The remastering on these 3 cd's are surpreme. 2 stars only because of amazon markets this as a remastered cd .iT'S NOT. Wasted my money."
4,Great classic rock & roll,"Bob Seger may be the last great rock 'n roller for us old heads (read: his contemporaries). The Distance has some of his best work. It has some of the greatest hard driving rock ever to blast through the speakers. If played in a moving car, ""Even Now"" is guaranteed to increase your speed by at least ten MPH (actually, I once talked a state trooper out of a ticket by telling him it was the fault of the Bob Seger coming through the tape player!). ""Roll Me Away"" is the greatest song to accompany a motorcycle ride since ""Born to be Wild"". This album rates less than five stars, though, because as great as ""Even Now"", ""Roll Me Away"" and the classic ""Shame on the Moon"" are, the rest of the songs are adequate by comparison. Certainly worth the money, though, by any standards."
5,"Salvific, Universal and Sincere","Overall, a truly wonderful asset in approaching the beautiful, enigmatic mystery of predestination and free will. Fr. Most's reasoning is sound and clear, giving the reader summaries after each chapter. Fr. Most presents strong arguments for the conclusion that God's plan includes in it each persons free response to grace, which is given to each man unendingly and given with the sincere and true intent of salvation. Other systems in Catholicsm, and Reformed thought, that pretend to universally distribute grace, but actually universally distribute inadequate grace, ultimately are inconsitent with God's true, universal love."
3,Could have been much better,"Growing up in the Washington D.C. suburbs I had the chance to see the Hangmen in person several times. Their live act was always exciting. However, their only album was somewhat emasculated as it contained re-recorded versions of their two hit 45's: ""Faces"" and ""What a Girl Can't do"". The original 45's had more of a punch and are worth seeking out as excellent examples of garage rock. I am basing my review on the vinyl album which I still own. With more playing time being available on the CD format, this album could have been improved tremendously by including the two single versions of their hits."
3,One Great Hard-to-Find Song!,"""What A Girl Can't Do"" is one of those 60's songs bands still play when they want the crowd to cheer. It's one of those songs you played on the jukebox at the all-night diner downtown when staying up all night was a rock 'n' roll given. It's also one of those songs really hard to find today in any medium other than those remaining ""Bitter Sweet"" albums moldering in closets around DC. This CD rekindles the entire album, reminding us about how many bands in those days made one great song surrounded by mellow covers and originals. Still, the Hangmen deserve three stars as the birthplace of Grin, Claude Jones, and the Rosslyn Mountain Boys - plus carrying plenty of equipment for the Jefferson Airplane."
4,Very good,"As promised, book was clean, without marks, in a very good condition.Delivered on time (I paid the extra), it definetely worth the money."
5,Kaufmann as Nietzsche's interpreter,"Kaufmann is to Nietzsche what Arthur Rubinstein was to Chopin -- a benchmark for any further interpretations. However, as Thomas Mann once aptly remarked, while this book gives a good idea about Nietzsche the philosopher, Nietzsche the man remains beyond reach. If you want to get closer to Nietzsche's soul read Ernst Bertram's poetic 'Nietzsche: Attempt at a Mythology' or Pierre Klossowski's 'Nietzsche and the Vicious Circle', both rather idiosyncratic, both utterly beautiful."
1,"Vapid, laughably prejudiced","Kaufmann is a bore, and all his criticism and exposition is ludicrously inadequate and born from politico-theological lunacy, the kind Nietzsche intensely despised. Kaufmann's primary objective is to simplify and twist Nietzsche's cosmically explosive thinking into highly accessible, pleasurable fluff. A disastrous example of awkward, politically-oriented dementia. Do not trust Kaufmann and his Christianized misinterpretations!!"
3,The album that made Duran Duran the Fab Five,"What can I say about this album that hasn't been said? If you are buying the CD to replace a vinyl that has seen better days, be prepared. This CD is different. I don't understand why Duran Duran has to remix everything several times, but the album is definitly different. Most of the album was remixed for the US release, the most noteable is ""my own way"" which suffered terribly through the transition. Get the original version on the video album. ""hungry like the wolf"" may have reverted to it's original english 45 release on this album, it is definitly missing a few notes. The bass guitar on ""hold back the rain"" is now missing, and in some song the drum kit seems to have been lost too.It's okay, but the remix hurts what was once a very dynamic album.John"
5,"""Rio"" Rocks!","""Rio"" was my first Duran Duran album and I've been hooked ever since. Duran Duran's theme for their music is ""sex and science fiction."" ""Rio"" is true to their mantra. In addition to ""Rio"" and ""Hungry Like the Wolf"", don't miss the artristry of ""Last Chance on the Stairway"" and ""The Chaffeur"""
5,"Excellent Album, It Keeps Going!","'Rio' is a fantastic album that true duranies have to love! 'Rio' has some wonderful classic songs that we all know, such as 'Save a Prayer', 'Hungry like the wolf' and of course 'Rio'! But the reason I really love this album is because it has really great obscure songs that you dont hear much anymore like, 'Last chance on the stairway' and 'My own Way' which happen to be my favorites! No matter how many times you listen to this alubm, you can't get tired of it, it's not possible!"
5,Excellent,"This remains the Duran's best effort to date. I can't think of any other album I own that paints pictures in my mind so vividly as this one does. It brims with all of the glamour, romance, and sentimentality that one can usually expect from the band, and although they have been heavily criticized for being fluffy, there really is lots of depth and meaning to their songs if one is simply willing to listen closely. This album is the true essence of Duran Duran. A classic."
5,duran could't have made a better one!,"We all remeber the first duran duran with songs like planet earth and girls on film. We all knew they were somthing special.They set the standerd for music vidios with the filming of such vidios as Rio, Hungry like the wolf and Lonely in your nightmare. The music on this album is one of those things that when your feeling down will make you want get up and dance. Rio is one you will charish forever!!!!!;^)"
4,The most underrated album of the 1980's...,"This album truly encapsulates the best of that early part of the 1980's music scene. A million different emotions, from one moment to the next, and musically infectious, which is something that way too many people never realized about Duran Duran--they had an ear for music. Never mind the sometimes awkward lyrics (""Swim seagull in the sky/To that hallowed Western Isle""), at the end of the day, the music speaks volumes more than any comparable band of the time, with the possible exception of the Police."
3,Not a bad album.,"Rio is a pretty good release. It's quite different than their debut album in that it's not as raw sounding. I don't think Rio is a classic album, but it does contain three great songs: those being ""Rio,"" ""Save a Prayer,"" and ""Hungry Like a Wolf."" The other tunes are good, but not great. ""Rio"" is a song that is unforgettable and just great--the bass line that John Taylor plays has always stuck in my mind. ""Save a Prayer"" is another keeper that is just beautiful and awash in nice keyboard playing from Nick Rhodes. This is an album with a lot of energy."
4,Once Le Bon a time...,"It's now seventeen years old, but this album has not dated as badly as some (the harsh critics of Duran) would have anticipated. Although the album has its share of weak moments, such as 'My Own Way' which is as banal as it ever was, this still stands as one of the best albums of the 1980s. 'Rio' is a happy, catchy, sing-along affair, but the album's truly great moments are 'Hungry like the wolf' 'Save a Prayer' and 'The Chauffeur', the latter of which is a truly interesting and original tune. Nostalgia aside, the Duran's have continued to be critically underrated in this decade. Let's hope they get the success they deserve in the near future..."
4,STILL GETTING USED TO but-------,After many years of NOT playing my sax I needed a new ligature and things sure have changed over the years!! I ordered this one according to other reviews---I'm no pro--just playing for myself as a hobby now. Still trying to get used to it---but so far I'm very pleased with the results!! I had questions when it first arrived and what amazed me most I think was that I e-mailed through AMAZON and got immediate responses back and forth till I was all squared away with my concerns---so the product is great and the company I got it from has GREAT customer service!
4,This ligature greatly improved my sound,"I bought my Rovner Alto Sax ligature several years ago, now. I really like it. I am actually a flutist who took up sax to get into the jazz band in college, so I was looking for every advantage I could get. This ligature definitely helped me tremendously. I know it is far superior to the standard metal ligature that came with my sax. The reed vibrates more easily. I get more and better sound.I still occasionally play my sax, which is just a student instrument, when there is a need in a small ensemble. Since I don't play regularly, I still need every advantage I can possibly get. I doubt I will ever part with my Rovner ligature. It has seen me through many challenges."
1,ajcmom,"Unhappy with what I received. The picture shows black with silver metal, but they sent one with gold metal which doesn't match a silver saxophone! If the item truly is gold colored, then picture it that way, or at least write in the decription that what you receive will be different than what is pictured!"
2,Get the hard copy,"I recommend readers purchase the paper version of this book. The way in which it was written, with many pages of ECGs followed by many pages of interpretations of those ECGs, makes it almost impossible to follow in an e-book format. If the publisher can either marry the descriptions with each ECG or add easy to follow hyperlinks between ECGs and they're descriptions, that might make the book more user friendly. I gave the e-book only two stars. I'm sure the hard copy warrants more."
3,misleading,"While the content is indeed good advice, the book refers to video that obviously the reader may not have seen and has no clue what the content of that video is. I think the overview is somewhat misleading as this book is actually a parents guide to be used with the main program. But........ I will agree that the methods advised are solid."
3,Devotional,"It was prophesised to Kans, the wicked king of Mathura, that the eigth child of his sister Devaki & her husband Vasudev, would be his nemesis. So killed seven of their children, but the eigth Child was born Krishna. Krishna - The pratham purush, the first & only principal that made this universe manifest & created humanity. Watch the episode of destruction of Kans by a mere stripling of a lad."
2,Disappointing,"For real LRB fans, the fact that this CD contains an far-too-short edited version of ""It's a Long Way There"" is reason enough to avoid this one. That cut was their magnum opus - how disappointing to have it truncated."
5,Another Under-Rated 70s / 80s Band....,Not a mega hit producer like Foreigner or Journey ... just a smooth sounding musical group that is just diverse enough to produce 12 legitimate hits over a ten year period. 40-somethings and 50-somethings will find the musical fun and refreshing.
4,little river band (digitally remastered),"the sound quality is excellent. so clean and crisp. but the original versions of man on your mind, night owl and take it easy on me are other versions. not to my likeing."
5,At last! A readable copy.,"This is not a literary review (We all know what Swann's Way is about), but my way of expressing relief that at last I have a readable copy of it. Out goes my old Folio paperback with its miniscule print -- Hooray!"
2,"Il s'agit bien de Proust, mais...","Peu de reproches à faire concernant le contenu (évidemment !), mais la typographie laisse franchement à désirer. Le peu de fautes d'orthographe et autres coquilles rend néanmoins la lecture agréable - à la différence du deuxième volume de la Recherche en édition gratuite."
3,Some of the best was left out,"One of the strengths of the early Dead, before they began writing their own material in earnest, was that they chose comparatively obscure songs from the folk and blues traditions rather than covering songs already familiar to most record buyers. Their first album is sadly neglected by too many deadheads, despite good material and energetic playing.I'd have been much happier with this collection had the compilers at least covered the entire first album, as I would love to hear the original (or earliest known) versions of Sittin' On Top of the World, Viola Lee Blues, Beat It On Down The Line, Good Morning Little Schoolgirl, all the old originals they completely ignored. (And was there an ""old, old"" Minglewood Blues? Details, please.)Omitting those important songs for fluff like Iko Iko, as well as quite a few completely familiar and readily available tunes, is a blown opportunity, if not an outright travesty."
4,Some great music!,"This is an excellent look at the roots of the dead's music. Merle Haggard and Howlin Wolf provide my two favorite tracks, although Jimmy Reed's track is great also. The only downfall of the album is ""Iko Iko"". That song is just plain not good. Overall the album is an excellent buy. You can always skip track three, (Iko Iko)."
3,historic interest only,"Some interesting tracks, and some entertaining ones. But doesnt have the jams that Dead fans appreciate. Many of the well written songs are recorded before modern improvements, and in outdated styles. Not for the casual Rock fan of the Dead."
4,Unbelievable...,"I fully agree whith the last reviewer. It is amazing that anyone could have been inspired by such GREAT music and yet been sooo bad. This is a great collection of tunes by a handful of legendary musicians with great cover artwork by Crumb to boot. My only problem is that the cover contains the words: ""Greatful Dead."""
4,shedding a little light ...,"In response to the readers who seemed confused, puzzled, or even irate over the notion of a mystery writing class being taught in a journalism department, I can say that it may be unusual, but it's far from absurd. In fact, at the University of Oklahoma the college of Journalism and Mass Communication offers both a B.A. and an M.A. in professional writing. By ""professional,"" they mean writing magazine articles, short stories, screenplays, and novels of commercial intent aimed at publication and not just literary self-expression. So a mystery-writing class in a journalism department? Sure thing, folks. Widen your horizons a little and be aware that somewhere in this world folks do occasionally think outside the box."
2,"Oh, please.",A class on mysteries being taught in a journalism dept.? This absurdity strained my credibility past the point of being able to enjoy anything about the book.
5,Very Enjoyable,"This is one of the best Death on Demand mysteries.One of the things that Carolyn does best is combine a little bit of humor with a little bit of mystery. She does that well in this book.Annie is teaching a class about three great mystery writers only to have her plans upset by three ladies of mystery. One is Annie's mother in law, as always, is delightful. Slightly off kilter and yet she is on the mark with most things. The other two are fans of mysteries and known for causing problesm where they go. Very good.Although it is usually easy to figure out who did it by the end of Carolyn Hart's books, it doesn't make it any less of an enjoyable read. THis is one of my favorite Death on Demand mysteries.As an added bonus, you get a lot of references to other mysteries that are good reads as well."
2,Too many allusions,"I enjoyed the actual mystery of the book (finding out who the Deep Throat was) but the numerous allusions to other mysteries really made me stumble. I read many mysteries, but there were way too many references to things I didn't know."
3,An impassioned plea for better readers,"Although billed as a collection, this series of essays holds its own as an extended monologue. Davies, as erudite a reader and writer as you will ever discover, is not for the faint of head. In his argument here, he attempts to describe why reading--intense, concentrated reading--can be valued as art. The likely argument against this idea is that reading is not an act of creation, which art aspires to. He quickly deflates that argument with a description of reading that could apply just as well to performance art.Although some of the writers he mentions here will likely be unknown to modern readers (they were certainly unusual to me), the points he makes are universal. We are in need of this even more today than when it was written."
1,"stuffy, typical","Conservative, stuffy voice, uncomfortable with new and innovative literature, about 200 years behind the times... And also the whole canadian bit alienates readers because its only interesting to canadians of course and nobody really cares outside of there. And he talks as if he's on the level of some of the greates writers but really he is pretty mediocre compared to the mad writing of the greats of now (DFW, Pynchon, Powers etc.)."
1,Deeply disappointing; not remotely up to Brewers' usual standard,Brewers' Dictionary of Phrase and Fable is indispensable. Famous Quotations is far below other available such dictionaries. Brewers should lift their game here and start again.
5,Another excellent J.A. Henckel product,"I was looking for a quality steak knife that would not break the bank. I have a 4 star Henckel knife set, but did not have any steak knives. One of my main requirements, was no serrated steak knife. These fit that build and matched my existing set nicely. The knives are sharp and high quality. For the price these are some of the best. I am very happy with my purchase."
4,Alvin Craftmaster art table,Works nicely. A bi hard to figure out direction but we got it eventually. Nice size to hold things but fit into the room. Discreet looking. Cover the table when using paints. Drawers tend to slide out of vertical holder so check them periodically and adjust
4,"A Definite ""Live"" Classic","ok, this cd is when d'angelo was first starting out, and it represents d'angelo in a smooth more laid-back frame of mind. d'angelo has an outstanding chemistry with his band and his audience, plus we a chance to here karen bernod and angie stone as his back-up singerswhy only 4 stars? by the time d'angelo toured his music from his voodoo tour, his live performance had changed..instead of laid-back songs, his music shows signs of his homage to prince, james brown, and parliament...which resulted in his meteoric performance at london's brixton acadamy....anyway, this is definitely something to be added to the d'angelo collection, if you're keeping one"
5,One of the best live albums you'll find,"This really does highlight how talented this artist is. Listening to the material live brings out a depth to it that you don't really get from the slickly produced studio versions. Plus there's a great, and surprisingly faithful, version of an Earth Wind & Fire tune, which i love."
3,you cant knock deangelo right? well...,"ok, you cant knock deangelo. but you can knock the quality of the recording on a live show. i think the recording of this album just doesnt have warmth to it. of course he does his classic tracks which makes this album good..but i cant take too much of it because all the songs sound distant."
5,Sexy like Christian Louboutin shoes!,"These peep toe slingbacks are HOT! They are so sexy! They look JUST like Christian Louboutins. The red sole is great. I usually wear 8M but I bought these in 8.5M. I'm glad I did. I recommend getting them a half size bigger. I don't think my foot would've fit into my regular size. I think my toes would've been scrunched up like crazy! There is some toe cleavage which I don't love, but my feet look so sexy in these shoes that I'm willing to overlook it."
3,Not Swahili-English,"This is a great dictionary if you want to look up an English word and find the correct way to use the Swahili word, as a previous review said it is very comprehensive in showing the usage. BUT it's not like every other language dictionary I've had that has half English-Swahili and the other half Swahili-English....this is only English to Swahili, which can be very frustrating when you're faced with a Swahili word you don't know."
3,"Comprehensive, but only English to Swahili, not vice versa","There are few Swahili dictionaries as extensive and comprehensive as this one, however note that it is only a one way translation, you can't look up Swahili words."
5,Fantastic King Arthur Stories,"I'm only a casual King Arthur fan, but this book may well have been the best one I've read about him. It had most of the tales I know, plus plenty I didn't (casual fan, devotees probably know them). The language was old-fashioned, but only to the point of interest and entertainment, not to the point of incomprehensibility. There...it...I don't even know what to tell you, aside from babbling on about how great this book was.There was no active table of contents, and there was only one scanning error I noticed, which was near the end, and honestly slightly hilarious."
3,adventures of Kla-Noh and Si-Lun,"This episodic series of adventures spans many years in the life of Kla-Noh and his apprentice Si-Lun. They work closely with the Initiates (monks) who safeguard the magical knowledge of Shar-Nun. The 3 ""secrets"" of Shar-Nun are not central to the novel, by any means, although each secret is worked into one adventure.Ardath Mayhar adopts the innocent story-telling style and archaic language of a Sinbad epic. Occasionally a poetic turn of phrase made me smile. There is much originality, but with echoes of fairytale, as in the chapter Shallah Sits at Her Loom. I was swept up in some of the tales (Eaters of Hearts, but found no surprises in others (Beast in the Barrens).The complete altruism and self-awareness of the main characters will strike some as refreshing and comfortable. Like Batman, Kla-Noh is independently wealthy and lives to help solve the great dangers and mysteries of his time. On the other hand, this is all too good to be true."
2,Don't buy this CD or LP....,"I love the songs in this collection. I just can't stand the recordings. The songs sound distant and thin. They lack any kind of depth. I like to feel as if I am right there in the studio on the original take, with each of the instruments jumping out in clear detail. GH collections seem to fall into this pitfall. Re-recordings often seem to loose that extra something in the process. You'll do better buying the original tracts."
4,Just the hits. No filler.,"Before Wingspan, this was the best way to condense the Wings era. Wings' albums never stood up to the quality of their singles, and this set gets most of their best songs together on one CD. From 1971-1978 most of the hits are here, and if you want just the hits, this is probably the way to go."
4,Great song Hi Hi Hi. W,"Actually I bought this mainly for Hi Hi Hi. What a great raw, dirty song. In the class of Helter Skelter. Any record company person out there, release `Give Ireland back to the Irish` on Cd. Also a great McCartney song."
4,"""Wings Greatest"" a fine (if sparse) collection","Wings' output for the 1978 Christmas season was this compilation that spanned 1971-1978. No complaint whatsoever on the material here. But what about the material that wasn't included? Nothing from ""Venus And Mars"" (a cardinal sin in my opinion) and tracks like ""Maybe I'm Amazed"" are missing. I understand that this album contained only the #1 hits, but there was plenty of great material to make this a double set. Fortunately, the upcoming ""Wingspan (Hits and History)"" does just that. For the cover art, Sir Paul directed that the statue be photographed on snow in Scotland. Points to anyone who can tell the difference."
5,High skill and good taste.,"This compilation of Paul McCartney's hits from 1971 to 1978 shows the advanced degree of perfection he had achieved during his Beatles period. All of the songs are full of maturity, musical skill, and good taste. True, not all of Wings songs deserve this positive criticism, but those included in this record yes.This album constitutes a nice and complete panorama of Paul's production to 1978, so it should be considered as a good option for both newcomers and fans."
4,Excellent,"This should be a 5 star album, but it's missing a song. Where is Listen to What the Man Said? The exclusion of this song is why I don't give this album 5 stars.All hits on this album, I especially like the unedited version of With a Little Luck (which was edited on All the Best).As good as this album is, you're better off getting All the Best which has more songs, including the underrated chestnut Good Night Tonight."
1,OUCH!,"The relevant question is not, ""What was [so and so] smoking when he or she reviewed this record?"". Rather, the relevant question is, ""What will YOU need to smoke (or drink or inject) after you listen to it?"" It's THAT excruciatingly HORRIBLE."
1,Pop music takes a nose dive.,"Wings represents a particular low point in twentieth-century popular music, and if you want to know why, just listen to this collection--then pour yourself a stiff drink."
1,Not in my home,"I guess I'm out of step with the other reviewers of this book. I find the pillows to be either ordinary, in which case I could have designed them myself, or ugly. But taste is subjective; some folks may like a fake bag of groceries on their sofa."
5,Great for trimming Scotch Broom,"I use the saw to cut Scotch Broom 1.5 inches and larger. This means a solid tool that can be use with one or two hands,and will resist getting tangled. I broke my prior saw, and this is a great replacement. It has a wide cut, which makesit less likely to bind as the cut gets near the end.Very easy to fold in and out, but locks in place. Also easy to clean and maintain, and at a very good price.I have also used on larger 6"" logs. You have a short stroke, but it cuts pretty well, especially if you are cuttingdown and can use both hands to put some weight on the blade."
5,Good product,Does everything it is supposed to. I love the fact the handle and head are all one piece.
2,Good brand but manufactured in China,"The design is good but quality of workmanship is lower than the ones made in Finland. Should be good for a few runs. Fiskars should make more in Finland even at higher retail price.Edit: weeble wobbles. Don't like this at all. Not representative of other Fiskars stuff, which are generally high value good stuff."
2,Fiskars 7947: No Longer Made in USA.,"Just received my new 7947, replacing an old trusty rusty 7947 which has served me longer than I can remember. I was immediately crestfallen upon opening the package to read: ""Made In China"". It's predecessor was proudly labeled: ""Made In USA"". I usually shop for tools in stores where I can identify the country of origin, avoiding Chinese imports. Live and learn."
5,Scary as Proverbial Hell,"In an age where most people automatically believe the snippets and pieces they are handed by corporate media (which in the US is the Right) as the whole and absolute truth, this book is a must read and should be on the reading list of every American. The in-depth discussions of the various far right units/groups are invaluable. What you don't know CAN hurt you and WILL if given half a chance. If knowing is half the battle, then this book is your ammo."
4,Gabbiano review,"In order to be more creative in the titles I have, I would give some good qualification to this title. Cybotron is a great electronic-progressive group from Australia that deserves more audience in the world. Get they music!"
4,Space rock to the square,"It's surprising, amazing how tough and heavy synthesizer based rock can get! Although ""Colossus"" is easily labelled prog rock, it's best imagined as the ""space"" feel of JM Jarre, Schulze, Kitaro, Telomere and consorts shifted into power-laden rock. These guys have the focus and harness that Tangerine Dream always lost too fast on the tracks of ""Stratosfear"", ""White Eagle"" etc. The downside is that they're a bit _too_ forward, that they sometimes get over the top, pathetic, pompous - occasional sparkles of introversion a la Camel would have provided a better balance."
3,out of it beats,"You know I wanted to dis these guys for having the same name as my favourite Detroit electro group, but then I came across this record in a second hand store and had a listen. Man it's pretty cool. Kinda like Hawkwind without the guitars. Definitly worth a listen"
1,Movie Butchered!,"This DVD of Rankin-Bass's ""The Hobbit"" has picture quality too dark to view, portions missing, parts repeated, cheesy transitions added, overly saturated colors, pixelation, jerky camera panning that I don't see on my VHS copy, and many sound effects missing. The company who did this, Movies on Parade, should be ashamed. I love this film and don't know why they tampered with it so much they made it unwatchable. This butchered version should not be sold or given away! Buy the Warner Bros. distributed version of this DVD because this one was ruined by an idiot ( or team of idiots ) that didn't know how to color correct or export, which is bad enough, but the spinning screen and page peel transitions were like an ungifted child doodling on a Picasso."
4,"Great indoors, rechargable, bulb burnt out","This product met my needs perfectly. I frequently work in the garage with the door open, which attracts a variety of insects. I leave this product turned on overnight after closing the garage door. By the next day, all the bugs are zapped. This keeps the spiders away because there are no insects to inspire their web building activity.The bulb burnt out rather quickly (less than 6 months) and I did find the owner's manual. While replacement bulbs are readily available (on eBay for instance), the manual does not describe how to replace the bulb. Instead, the manual instructs the reader to call the Customer Service Department at 888-305-0800."
2,Worked for a good year..,This was a real find - a rechargable zapper that worked indoors and out. The light died after one year of steady use inside and out. The light was excellent as well for those late nights on the deck.Wish it had lasted longer.
1,Bogus claims!,"This and other bug zappers are totally bogus for outdoor use. I learned the hard way and ate my cost after buying one of these. Indoors they will attract most flies/moths, but outdoors you basically want them to kill mosquitoes and they absolutely do NOT attract or kill mosquitoes, only other bugs, including some beneficial ones that EAT mosquitoes. This technology has been proven ineffective for years."
4,"Great product, lasts about a year","Works great, traps a lot of insects especially the small ones (little flies that other zappers will never catch). The only drawback is the bulb burns out after a year. I purchased a replacement bulb online but it lasted only a month. Now I have a white bulb that I purchased from a department store. Still does the job although may not be as attractive to insects."
4,Beautifully elusive garden images,"While the text essays in this book are a bit dry, the photographic reproductions are of top notch quality. Kenna's photographs are beautifully elusive, sometimes printed quite dark, yet remain salient throughout. I found myself wondering how the images looked on the contact sheets, straight, with no darkroom manipulations. This book serves as a great example of what you can do in the darkroom to bring out a more poignant image than you actually shot at the location. It should be required for anyone who works with black and white photography in the darkroom; not because you will gleen any certain tips or techiques but because you will study the final results and perhaps wonder how they were achieved.As a photographer, this book will remain in my photo book collection and it is Kenna's strongest work to date."
3,The weakest book of series.,"I did not like this book, it was to short. I think that the writer could have add a lot more to it. I wanted to know more about Ro and how Starfleet sees her after she captures the killer. The part about the borg was boring. I still do not understand how the Borg-Starfleet got to the Gamma Quad."
2,Lesser novel,"Compared to the first three volumes of Mission Gamma, this installment is thin in many ways. It's thin in that it's half the length of the first installment, it's thin in that the characters lack depth in what should be times of great tragedy. It's thin it that it looks for explanations for horrifying events OUTSIDE the pervue of Deep Space Nine's characters. Thus, since Deep Space Nine has always been character driven, Simpson's approach undermines the show's legacy with senseless and uninspired action and dashes hopes that the violent cliffhanger of the third book would lead to a better understanding of Bajor and its place in the Federation. The DS9 relaunch has steadily cranked its characters through various personal and professional ringers, stretching and challenging them in fascinating new ways in the process. This default to brainless conspiracies is deeply disapointing."
2,And I was actually lolking foward to reading this!,"I found this final installment of the Mission: Gamma series almost comical compared to the first three books, which I thoroughly enjoyed. The characters seem poorly developed and the dialogue between them often seems childlike and moot. Although some fairly dramatic occurences take place, I found myself uninterested and felt that the plot was a long stretch, even by Star Trek standards."
3,All bands need a recharge...,"An ok album by talented musicians and entertainers that rode the crest fast and in the limelight...songs are good, but a few memorable as standouts."
4,Duranee Must-Have!,"If you're a fan of the Notorious band Duran Duran, then this box set of Seven And The Ragged Tiger is a must-have! The re-released and re-mastered audio CDs along with bonus tracks and tons of near remixes sound amazing and clean. The DVD with videos from the era of this album plus a few before and after to fill the space make a great collector's item as well and are a fun watch if you want to be transported right back to the 80's to relive the bizarre era of concept videos and DD's specific anthem-style videography. Also includes some interesting throwbacks like individual mini-posters of each of the band members which came with a rare edition of the original LP album, includes the jewel case booklet from the original CD case as well. The box is well produced, neatly printed, and conveniently fits into any CD rack. Excellent buy!"
5,Memorable album,"As already said this is the 3rd DD album, dated 1983. It s a differnet path from thei first work (Duran Duran) and Rio. DD undertook a more rock-commercial path with songs like The Reflex and New Moon on Monday (dancing beat!). But for tme the beauty of this CD is in the other tracks: The seventh Stranger, a struggling ballad with SImon's voice at the top, Tiger Tiger, one of the most beautiful instrumental track ever, Shadows on your side, very 80's song with glittering music, The Union of the Snake, one of the most mature track of the album.DD are 4 albums: DD, RIO, this one and ASTRONAUT (their smashing 2004 come back album).If you liked RIO, this will bring you into a different direction; but it is needed if you want to get inot the soul and mood of this band."
5,Duran gets moody,"In this third album, Duran plays a more atmospheric, moody album. With the exception of the much over-played radio faves, ""The Reflex"", and ""Union of the Snake"", it's a more emotional Duran than I had heard in the past. Very good for a night alone with a glass of wine."
1,AWFUL Remastered,"I don't know how this masterpiece album was Remastered.. should be Digitally ""RETARDED"".The first issue sounds very good.The peaks the highs and mediums sounds horrible like a bad ripped MP3"
3,A respectable listening experience.,"I remember buying the cassette of this years ago around the time that it was released in 1983. I admit that it's not one of my favorite albums, but I still respect and listen to it here and there. I don't have a favorite album from Duran Duran--I like a few songs off each release (mostly the earlier material). Seven and the Ragged Tiger has an interesting overall sound to it though. It's a different listening journey than the first and second albums. I like the way Nick Rhodes utilizes the keyboards on this album. The songs that stand apart from the others are ""Tiger Tiger,"" ""The Seventh Stranger,"" and ""The Reflex."" The instrumental ""Tiger Tiger"" is very good indeed and well put together. I think that Duran Duran did a pretty good job putting Seven and the Ragged Tiger together. Give this album a listen."
3,Original CD sounds better,"I'm commenting on the remastered sound here, not on the music. However, I will say that Duran Duran are one my favorite groups, and this is a great album overall. Unfortunately, this remaster is dull. The sound level is louder, but that doesn't really mean anything. You control the volume knob. The soundstage is two-dimensional; the dynamic range is squashed; the bass is weak, and the high frequencies are a little distorted. Is the original CD perfect? Of course not. But it didn't sound too bad either. Rio is a different story--the original CD mastering was poor, and the reissue sounds significantly better. Seven and the Ragged Tiger was remastered by a different engineer at a different studio and sounds worse in basically every way. This is one of those cases where you're better off staying with or finding the original issue CD."
5,Still Hungry for Duran Duran,"I first bought this album at the age of 14, and I wore it out. I attended their concert, and had the time of my life. I bought the T-shirt; my mom thought the symbols had some hidden satanic meaning and secretly tossed my T in the trash. I sang the lyrics at the top of my lungs, not knowing what the hell they meant, and frankly, I still don't! I majored in literature and am great at discovering the deeper meanings in poetry. This stuff has no deeper meaning. It makes no sense at all. But Simon's squeals and sighs makes it all right. And it's still one of my favorite albums, ever!"
1,Terrible remastering.,"I have read a lot of reviews complaining about remastering jobs and I have usually disagreed with them. This one, though, is just atrocious. The sound is so squashed that the highs are unnerving and there's no dynamics whatsoever. It's totally horrendous.What makes little sense to me is that I picked up Big Thing and Notorious remastered and they sound good. This hurt my ears. The songs from this album sounded much better on the Greatest album. Even the bonus disc comes out worse for wear. I just don't understand how the engineers involved couldn't hear how bad they made this sound. What a waste.The DVD, however, has an interesting show, but it appears the music isn't live or there were copious overdubs done afterward."
5,I love the DVD,"I've just loved to review some DD old videos, especially the movie version for New Moon on Monday. Í strong recommend it for DD fans!!!"
3,Nothing special,"While there are a few musical treats in this special edition, and yes, the sound quality has been remastered, the internal packaging leaves a lot to be desired. I would have preferred some narrative, some liner notes, some insight into the album and the time period. Maybe some words from the band members, recollections, etc. Instead, all you really get are a bunch of cheaply printed cardboard promo pictures of the band that we've all seem a million times before. How about some images we've never seen? Something to make it special. It's just not special enough. At least the price is reasonable. I just expected/wanted more."
5,A very good sample of early Duran Duran,"Seven&the Ragged Tiger has many memorable songs, like New Moon on Monday and Shadows on Your Side. Like all Duran Duran albums, it takes a while to get used to it, but you should get into it. It's worth it just for The Reflex."
1,DURAN 7 AND THE RAGGED TIGER - REISSUE,"WOW, wish i would have paid attention to the other reviews about the sound quality... IT SUCKS.i'm so disappointed, the original CD actually sounds better in my PC."
2,A good effort,I've been trying to listen to this album since it was released in '84 but I can't really stand the album and I love Duran Duran. Most of the songs are crap. There is only 2 songs really worth listening to and that's The Reflex and Union of the Snake. Buy the greatest hits or Strange Behaviour import with extended remixes of all their greatest hits and then some.
2,Duran Duran want's to be mythical,"After the great Rio album with it's catchy songs and funny easy lyrics Duran Duran became Megastars. But on this album the band tried to write some dark and mystical lyrics to they're popsongs. But the result is often embarrasing and just shows a band who tries to live up to the myth of rock. Union of the snake is probobly the worst ""first single"" from any on they're albums and the version of ""the Reflex"" is not as good as the single version. Some fine moments though: the beautiful and glamorous Tiger Tiger and the single New Moon On Monday. A song whih sounds like Duran Duran meets the David Bowie Let's Dance LP."
2,Worst Duran album by far,"I'm a great Duran Duran fan, and every one of their albums offers something to the listener. But ""Seven"" is simply their worst album, marred by poor songwriting, lumbering beats, and heavy-handed production that drove the music into the ground.The only reason this album sold was the world was in the midst of Duran mania. It's clear the album was recorded when the band was worn out by the previous tour, and rushing to get back on the road for the next.The best tracks on the album are the opening track, the undeniably exciting ""The Reflex,"" and the second track, the smiling pop of ""New Moon on Monday.""As for the rest of the album, I'd skip it. Instead, pick up Rio, Duran Duran (first album), and 2004's excellent ""Astronaut."""
2,Duran Duran's Worst Album,"Seven and the Ragged Tiger sounds as though it was rushed out as quickly as possible to capitalise on Rio's well-deserved success. There is little more to this album than trashy pop songs with nonsensical lyrics - I Take the Dice and Cracks in the Pavement must be two of the most irritating and meaningless songs ever. The only spark of Duran Duran's considerable talent on 7&TRT is The Seventh Stranger, a haunting, poetic masterpiece which earns the album two stars."
4,addictive,"duran's pop efforts usually annoy u by the 10th or 11th play...but yet these songs stray away from duran's redudant formula and give u some addictive pop candy. I've had their tape since its release and occassionally from time to time, you'll find that tape in my deck."
3,One of the few decent Duran Duran albums,"..They were light years beyond today's ""boy bands"". I guess they had better producers and musicians backing them up back in the 80's. There are two tracks on this CD that show a degree of maturity in this group and hint to their later work (not the Robert Palmer garbage, the stuff after that): ""Tiger Tiger"" and ""The 7th Stranger"". As for the other stuff, the first billion times I heard it on the radio was plenty enough for me."
5,Great album that rounds-off Duran`s early `80s vision.,"All 9 tracks are excellent and work well together. The album contains a version of ""The Reflex"" that is so much better than the single edit, ""New Moon on Monday"" is just fantastic, and the instrimental ""Tiger Tiger""...wow!!! Worth buying for these tracks alone. JB"
3,In their own words:,"John Taylor: ""We were just drunk [on our new-found success] by this point. We were so into living the dream...and part of the dream was that you made at least one of your albums on the French Riveria.""Nick Rhodes: ""I thought the thing was never going to get finished. It really took a long time. There was a lot of different feelings in the band about the direction we should take.""Simon LeBon: ""We started off in the south of France, then we went to Mt. Surratt, came back to the U.K. briefly and ended up finishing it off in Austrailia...Sydney. It was a difficult time. It really was.""John Taylor: ""We re-recorded it like three times. We did it once and said, 'Nah, this isn't right.' Did it again, said, 'Eh.'""Nick Rhodes: ""To me that album, more than any of them, on the surface of it seems like there's a lot of pretty songs on there, but then underneath there there's this sort of not quite controllable hysteria scratching away at the surface."""
5,Not yer average slow jams comp....,"What a nice surprise - It's about time somebody put an interesting mix of tunes and not the same old same old. Standout tracks are Little Beaver's ""Party Down"", a new version of Third World's ""Sense Of Purpose"" and the best remastering job I've heard in awhile for the Gloria Lynne classic ""I Wish You Love"". Definitely different - You are not likely to see this diverse a lineup of artists on any other comp. But it for Valentines day and surprise that hard to please lover."
5,Foster Care Revealed,"This is a heartfelt, painfully true story of how one child can be forgotten in the ""system"". Even the cover itself is revealing...the only photograph the author has from her childhood and it does not even show her face.By far my favorite book of alltime. I recommend it to all socialworkers, teachers, counselors, mothers, fathers, ministers, politicians, EVERYONE! It is well-written and easy to read, although it caused me to lose sleep at night knowing children are out there--alone, forgotten by their caseworkers, and lacking the basic needs such as touch, hugs, encouragement, or even a smile from those whose care they are in.How Ms.Cameron did what she did all alone is beyond me. She is simply amazing.After reading this book I wanted to reach out and hug Ms. Cameron.She has made me a better mother."
1,"Bad product, worst customer service.","I bought a pair of Bugaboots about 6 years ago and have worn them maybe 10 to 15 times. The boots are barely broke in and when I went to use them recently I pulled the lace right through the D Ring. Upon further examination I noticed that more than half of the D Rings are nearly corroded through, and these boots are barely broken in. Columbia's warranty department informed that this would be considered normal wear and that they would not be willing to compensate me for the inferior product. I have owned many lower priced boots and have never had an issue even close to this happen to them. I used to think that Columbia was a premium product, and they have always been priced to reflect that, but this situation has completely changed my mind. I would strongly suggest not wasting your money on an overpriced inferior product."
3,bugabootoo could be better....,"I got these boots from REI 6 or 7 years ago and forget what I paid for them. They've lasted me through many New England winters. They're comfortable and do keep your feet warm and dry as advertised. When I pulled them on after our first snow this year, I noticed that the rubber had cracked in a few spots and the seams were pulling apart. My wife also had the same problem with hers after only a couple of seasons (she hardly wore them). It seems as though the rubber they use is inferior. Maybe with a little luck and some shoo goo, I can get another season out of them. I wouldn't recommend them if they're still using the same rubber. For the money, there are better boots out there that will last a lot longer. Next time, I'll spend the extra money and get the boots from that place in Maine."
1,"Poor design, never again","Third time wearing my Bugabootoo boots, no more than 6miles walked, and already a 3"" separation between the leather & rubber sections. A tear, really, since this is a split in the rubber along the seam connecting to the uppers: a tear could be re-stitched, this is not fixable. I have had excellent experience with Columbia coats, but from the number of complaints about this boot, and with my first-hand view of the poor construction, I will not be buying Columbia boots (or shoes) ever again."
2,Boots cracked,"I had owned these boots for about 3 years and wore them in the winter and a couple of times a year when working at work camps in the summer. I had been pretty happy with the boots because they are comfortable and held up pretty well.This past summer, however, one of the seams on the front part of the boot (just below the bottom left lace) tore apart. The rest of the boot is in great shape, but I am obviously very disappointed in the workmanship of this boot. That being said, I cannot recommend these boots to anyone who intends to keep them for more than 2 years.I sent an email to Columbia customer service with photos of the broken seam to see if they would replace the boot. Stay tuned."
2,Warm and flexible---until it isn't...,"I purchased these boots to last through Chicago winters. They are relatively light and comfortable, but the contact point between the rubber and leather begins cracking, letting in moisture and hurting one's foot. For the price, these boots should be durable---instead they are defective."
2,chafing above ankle,"The boot is comfortable in the foot and is warm and waterproof with good traction. However, the upper chafes my legs just above the ankle. I have noticeable abrasions and extreme discomfort. I don't normally have this problem with boots. I believe that the upper is too rigid. In any event, I cannot wear this boot anymore because it is so uncomfortable."
4,I wanted them but the fit was not right,"The Columbia Bugabootoo boots were everything I wanted, except, when they arrived and I tried them on, they were not wide enough to accommodate my bunion. So the boots were fine but my own physical problem prevented me from keeping them."
4,Great boots!,"Comfortable, warm, and dry. You really don't want to take these off. Tread freely through anything with confidence, and great traction. Awesome value."
1,Pleaas do *not* buy this product,"Worked OK for a few outings, but seams fell apart at the seams after approximately 10 wearings. (See other reviews for confirmation that this is not an abberation.) Ridiculous. Will *never* buy a Columbia product again. Period."
5,Classic score that's uplifting,"I own the 30th Anniversary Edition of this album (which is the exact same thing as this one, only digitally remastered). This is the classic score to the classic 1976 movie. I remember when Rocky came out in '76. One of the great things about the movie was the music. Back then it motivated and provided an uplift to so many people to get up off their lazy behinds and go kick some...well...behind. It still has the same effect today. Every song on this album is great. The movie itself is great. The music was composed and conducted by Bill Conti. The first Rocky movie is my favorite of the whole series, even though Rocky lost to Apollo Creed.This album even contains Take You Back, the street corner song.If you want one of the great movie scores of all time, get this one. Highly recommended."
5,"Forget Subway and Atkins, THIS is your weight loss plan","This past summer I decided to lose some weight, and listening to this as well as the Rocky IV soundtrack during my workout pushed me even harder, and I achieved my goal. The music is so inspiring, and it will help you achieve at whatever you're doing in life.Thank you Bill Conti for this wonderful music, and thank you Sylvester Stallone for these inspiring movies."
2,A good workout but uninspiring and almost boring.,"Although Stephanie Steele has the personality of a cucumber, I was semi-satisfied with the video because I felt like I got a fairly good workout. If you put forth the effort, you will definitely sweat and feel tired-out by the end of the tape. The video definitely does not inspire you to do the workout every day (or even a second or third time), and the music stinks."
4,Not for the faint-of-heart or unmotivated beginner.,This video shows all the correct moves which require persistence in developing your ability. She is no-nonsense and to the point. It is not for entertainment or to hold your hand. It is a workout with basic offensive moves so there is no defensive tactics.
3,Good Start,"I agree with some of the other viewers on the fact that the video may be somewhat boring. However, I thought it was a very helpful for me as a person with no previuos experience with kickboxing; the instructions were very clear and helped me understand the basics and achieve better flexibility and muscle tone in a short period of time.I recommend this video as a basic instructional tool after which more advanced levels are needed."
1,Do not buy this tape!!!,"This tape is not challenging. The music was dubbed in after the tape was made. The instructor does not move to the music which makes it tough to get into the groove. The only person in this tape is the instructor. There was no motivation. Most exercise tapes have people in the background moving in sync with the instructor, not this low budget production! After one workout this tape found the garbage and I got a better workout throwing this tape in the trash. Do yourself a favor and buy a different video."
2,Yawn,"This workout is very repetitive; I got bored doing it the very first time. The instructions aren't that hard to follow, but the moves require turning around a lot so you can't watch what you are supposed to be doing. One of the kicks that is repeated many times requires turning and kicking at the same time while this move isn't that difficult, it puts strain on my knees. The instructor could be intimidating to beginners because she is always kicking to the ceiling without giving much encouragement for less experience people. I'm sure that this workout does burn a lot of calories if you can get through it, but then again so does jumping up and down in place."
3,not that bad!,"I have to agree that Stephanie isn't the most motivating instructor (and it's not because I'm jealous!). Her instruction though is easy to follow for the beginner -- she wants you to do the moves correctly. It's up to you though how much of a workout you get. If you put in a good effort - -you will sweat! However, i do prefer her aerobic boxing workout. It really gets your heartrate up. I go back and forth with her videos and more insipring ones that keep my motivation up. I return to hers to work on my technique."
1,Only Knocked into the Trash,"Not normally one to give up, I tried this video once. It was boring, uninspiring, and certainly no challenge. The moves were not fully explained. I have to be very careful with my knees, and I found if I followed Steele's instructions exactly (snappy, full-extension movements and pivoting on the support leg) my knees were bothered.Don't bother unless you want a very basic video to just get the blood moving a little."
4,Good start for martial arts / aerobics combination,"I bought this video 2 years ago and liked the combination of kickboxing with an aerobic benefit. Some people who don't feel comfortable with self-defense moves may find this workout a bit intimidating, but I've also recently bought the set of martial arts workout videos that can be a bit more overwhelming than Stephanie Steele's kickboxing workout. She has a good pace going, though background music could be a bit more updated and funky. This video interested me in Martial Arts, and I am now in Taekwondo."
2,too difficult to follow,"I have problems in following Ms.Steele's instructions. She was too quick and I didn't get much of an aerobic workout. The punches, hooks, and kicks were demonstrated nicely, but very difficult to follow. It's definitely not for beginners."
2,"Ick, ick, ick!","I got this video in the sale rack when I was in high school. I have done it a few times since then, but I have to say that it is so dull that I usually quit in the middle of it. It is cheaply produced and has awful music, plus it is very repetitive. The moves are not by any means complex or exciting, and you have to stretch them pretty far to feel like you're getting a workout. Additionally, the eighties-feel of the decor in the video is nauseating, and most of all Stephanie's tacky red leotard is just too cheesy. Overall, this video is not even good for a rainy day."
3,"to the point, no yapping","I usually avoid exercise videos because of all the yapping and constant chatters going back and forth among the people in the videos. With this one, you will get a good workout with adequate instructions. Every time that I do this exercise, I get a very good workout."
1,Z-z-z-z-z-z-z,"This is hands-down the worst workout video I've ever tried. I've done real kickboxing as well as cardio-kickboxing, and the sport is very exciting, but you would never know it from this video. The instruction is slow and boring, and the attempts to cater it to different levels just don't work. I can't imagine anyone reaching for this tape on a regular basis."
3,Dont read this book unless you fully accept reincarnation,"I bought this book having been recently studying Zen buddhism and found the focus of this book was getting ready for re-birth and being scared of how one was to be re-born. As a student of philosophy I have not accepted the theory of re-birth although I find most Buddhist teachings to be practical and informative. I am not ready to accept that my mind will float off when I die and I may end up a ""hell ghost"" or a fly or some other insect and would say to anyone that unless they accept this theory, there is little to be taken from reading this book."
4,"Difficult book, for grad student but it rewards time spent.","This book certainly isn't for the casual reader, but it is a great book for those who want to learn Advanced quantum mechanics and quantum electrodynamics from a distinguished physicist from a different point of view. Sakurai interjects his own beautifully strange and humourous analogies through out the work, such as comparing the creation, anihilation and number operators to the hindu trinity of Brahma, Siva and Vishnu respectively. Again there are some people who don't get this book, yet there are others who love it."
2,Not the best text,"Most of the graduate students in physics and chemistry here at Cal agree that this book is incomplete and glosses over too much of the details. It's also very annoying to read things like, ""Proof: The proof is trivial."" Anyone studying from this text will be left with the feeling that something is missing. Personally, I prefer the classic two volume ""phonebook of quantum mechanics"" by Cohen-Tannoudji et al."
3,Lacking Physical Insight,"This textbook gives a rather formal treatment of quantum mechanics. That is not to say that it is in a theorem-proof format like Neumann, for example, but still I find it lacking actual physical context: the author gives too much emphasis to algebraic derivation as means of explaining basic concepts.Personally, I find Landau much more enlightening (if, as students often complain, harder to read). I would suggest to use these two books as complementary to each other: Sakurai for its clarity and Landau for its physics.My other favorite, at a more introductory level, is Shankar, for it is very physical and very easy to read."
3,J.j.sakhurai,i'm interesting cost is about 50-60 $ of the Advanced Quantum Mechanics by J. J. Sakurai.
2,Not enough practices...,"This book is a easy way to learn definations. However, if you want to have practice multiple choice questions for your class tests... better luck next time because this book do not have multiple choice practices; except those 2 AP tests... Oh and i was surprise to see the book because it is VERY thinI can't believe i am saying this but REA's (AP US and comparative govt) is better than Prinston review's AP govt book. In that book there are multiple choice questions chapter by chapter, unlike this prinston review's AP GOVT."
5,montana bear stories review,"Great book! Very interesting true life stories that pull you in and let you experience some of these exciting adventures. Once I started the book, I could not put it down. A must read!"
1,Rambling in the World?,"I was intrigued to get this when I saw a very interesting graphic from it elsewhere. When I received the book, though, I was very disappointed. The author seems to just ramble on about geography. This wouldn't be so bad-- and might be interesting-- but he starts out by establishing that geography is interwoven in all areas of life. This gives him wide berth to ramble about pretty much any topic. I didn't get through it."
4,The start of Ranma 1/2,This is the start of ranma. It's about a boy named Ranma that fell in a cursed pond and now he turns into a girl whenever he touches cold water and turns back when he touches hot. This is one of the best anime series ever. If u haven't seen this your missing out. This anime show has alot of action and comedy. Hey tell me what's not funny about 5 girls fighting over who is Ranma's fiance. He has 5 fiances! well gotta go gotta watch my Ranma tapes.
4,Russia in 1903,"The other reviewers have said what I enjoyed about this book. However, there were some chapters that essentially were catalogs of political officials, church functions, etc., most of which I forgot as quickly as I read them. I'm pretty compulsive about reading everything; I should learn to skim through or skip over sections like that. But most of the book gave me wonderful descriptions of what life was like in Russia at that time and those gave me great pleasure and left me with impressions which will stay in my memory for many years. I do also wish there were a glossary in this book of all the Russian terms which I could not look up each time I came across them and still get the flavor of the impressions described. I must say, finally, that I greatly enjoy Troyat's writing as he does so much research and puts this in his writing. The fact that he chose a fictional character, Russell, who was visiting Russia in 1903 and being shown around certainly helped this book to hang together."
2,Great album by Seger but not his best really!,"Only a few songs I like on here that are from my Bob Seger's Greatest Hits CD like ""We've Got Tonight"", ""Old Time Rock & Roll"" and of course ""Hollywood Nights"". The rest of his music a split opinion i've never heard before whether it's good or bad. That's for you to decide yourself!"
1,Another comment on this album!,"Oh yeah forgot to mention one more song on here from my Bob Seger's greatest hits called ""Still The Same"" that i also like as a favorite!"
5,Huge Seger Fan !,"This has one of my all time favorite tunes, by Seger on it. I wore the last one out, playing it and this is a relacement !Great Album !"
3,Bob Seger - Coquers The World,"Seger had hit the big time with his previous two albums, ""Live Bullet"" and ""Night Moves"". He was now a huge rock n roll star who could fill arenas from coast to coast. The pressure was on for more hits and with ""Stranger In Town"" Seger delivered the goods. Many tracks from this album were (and still are) all over AOR / Classic Rock radio. ""Hollywood Nights"", ""Still The Same"", ""Old Time Rock N Roll"", ""Feel Like A Number"", and ""We've Got Tonight"" have been played to death over the years which may be why I am a bit lukewarm on this album. I don't think that it is up to the same level as ""Night Moves"" and is probably on a par with the next one ""Against The Wind"". ""Brave Strangers"" and ""The Famous Final Scene"" are highlights and the song ""Feel Like A Number"" always reminds me to treat my employees (I work as a production supervisor) as real people and not like the character in the song. Overall this is a solid Seger disc but not quite as good as ""Night Moves"" in my opinion."
3,A little on the mellow side,"Some Seger songs really rock, some don't ever seem to get going, and some of both categories get overplayed on the radio. There are all of the above on this CD. But Old Time Rock & Roll is an anthem for people like me who are stuck in the 70's with most of our musical tastes. Most of it is engaging to listen to and the mellow stuff can be skipped easily with the >> button."
4,a seger classic,"This album features one of the GREATEST and prettiest songs Seger ever wrote- ""Till it Shines"". THAT is a fantastic song! In fact, this is one pretty solid album overall, with only the atrocious ""Old Time Rock and Roll"" doing a nice job irritating the heck out of me. Seger sure had some brilliant songs, and I'm really happy this is yet another solid album. Yes, it was one of his most popular albums, but you can't argue with the quality of the songwriting and Seger's excellent voice. ""Feel Like a Number"" is another song worth hearing for its excellent vocals and rocking vibe, not to mention featuring lyrics I can relate to."
4,A Classic!,"Is there anything better than the version of ""Old Time Rock & Roll"" done by Bob Seger and the Silver Bullet Band? Not for my money, there isn't.And 1978's Stranger in Town is full of great rockin' tracks like that. ""Hollywood Nights"" is a true rock n' roll classic, and ""Feels Like a Number"" and ""Ain't Got No Money"" have that same bluesy rockin' vibe that infuses this album with a good amount of old fashioned rock n' roll fun.This is balanced by Seger's great ability to pen a more thoughtful, softer rock tune, as he does in ""Still the Same,"" ""We've Got Tonite,"" and ""The Famous Final Scene.""It all adds up to a great, classic album. Not Seger's best, but still very strong and thoroughly enjoyable."
4,different world views,"Arneil's monograph studies both the philosophy and politics in Locke's writings and their historical impact. Her work offers insight into different world views. Different from most of ours today. But also, in Locke's time, there were two broadly divergent world views, amongst the European colonists in the Americas.One, shared by Locke and the English, was that in the 1600s, their rightful claim to the American land was valid not by force of arms, but by the subsequent peaceful farming of the land. Granted, this imputed few rights to nomads previously using that land. But the attitude was quite different from that of the Spaniards, which was based on the right of conquest.Thus, a value of the book is not just in an understanding of Locke, though it certainly gives such. It also provides a perspective on historical developments in the Americas, of which he was an active participant."
4,Restores balance at this critical time.,"I was encouraged that this book speaks more to the sovereignty of God, than it does the sovereignty of America. Don't misunderstand, I am pro-America, proud to be here... but, the danger is that we equate Americana with the Kingdom of God.Lucado, the word-smith that he is, draws us back to our Heavenly Father in this work. The message he suggests: ""God is pro-you."" (As opposed to God is for-America). That's a complex idea to communicate, it seems. And, Lucado's inspirational work here focuses us in a much needed away.Another book to read... of a much different audience... Saint Augstine's The City of God (note, though, Lucado's work is inspirational and Augustine is somewhat academic in that work)."
5,Made my dad cry!,This was a great buy for Christmas. It made my dad cry and he is a very non-emotional man. I would definitely recommend this as a gift to someone.
3,Not what I expected,I watched the dvd waiting to see how to finish the quilt. The dvd did not teach me how to finish the quilt. I am a first time quilter and I had already seen videos on how to paper piece. But this dvd was supposed to have a part in it that showed how to finish off the quilt. I was looking to see how to put batting and back on and there was nothing in the dvd that showed how. If you want to learn to paper piece this is ok but you better know how to do all the rest cause this wont show you.kinda disappointed so I sent the dvd back.
5,A shining star from another world,"Thunder Perfect Mind is an absolutely stunning, puzzling and yet frightening piece of musical art. It attains the perfect balance between silence and disturbance. Be ready."
5,Buy this CD Now!!!!!,"If you are into Current 93 at all, this is a must. The CD is more of an epic adventure than an album. Definitely worth it."
5,A classic of apocalyptic folk,"If you only get one Current 93 and you want their folky (as opposed to their ""noisy"" experimental early music), this is the one to get, as it epitomizes their apocalyptic folk style. The lyrics encompase Tibet's typical eschatalogical themes (both Christian and Far Eastern), and the music is absolutely gorgeous."
4,The Two,"During the reading of this book, I couldn't put it down. It is very compeling. I wanted to stop the process of discovery by Nan on several occasions and also wanted to change the outcome on many occasions. However, it was interesting that I felt that the two women characterizing good and evil were both very likeable. In fact 'good' was a little icky at times and this turned me aside from her wishes. It is a very interesting book that takes some consideration and self-discovery. I liked it."
3,works but not real comfortable,"I can't put my finger on why this isn't exactly right, but it just isn't as comfortable as other brands I have used. it does do what it was intended to do."
3,"Pricey, and lacking some features","The new Hat Trick has a bar on the top so you can hit the tambourine. This one does not. Hence, three stars."
5,A Satisfying Read,"Teresa is a flawed parent; two failed marriages, four messed-up children by two fathers, each with issues that run the gamut from closeted homosexuality to alien abduction. Told chapter by chapter from the viewpointof main characters, a fully rounded portrait of Teresa's life is rivetingly told. This is a psychologicalnovel of flowing, engaging prose. Stick with it to the end for one of the most life-affirming denouementsin recent fiction."
1,"Great Potential, Pitiful Result","What showed great potential ended up presenting a pitiful result. From the jacket and the first few chapters you find this is the story of a family over a 30 year period, the novel ends up being a confusing mess (unless, possibly, you read it in one setting). Some of the characters are extremely well drawn and their stories well told; others are poorly drawn and you are left at the novel's end confused by the missing pieces and their story. The author jumps around too much; if you are unable to read the story in one setting, you end up totally lost and confused and try to compensate by going to earlier parts of the novel to try to reacquaint yourself with the more poorly drawn characters and thier story. It doesn't work."
2,This book is dated,"While providing a good overview of the topic, most references and studies used are at least 20 years old. This book is badly in need of an update, but will do in a pinch. There don't seem to be any other books of this type, so this is probably as good as it gets until an updated edition is published."
1,Introductory Microeconomics (College Level Examination Series (Clep 40),I was disappointed with this one. There is no study material to go along with practice tests.
5,Would make a better religion than Scientology,"If the premise of this book does not grab you, the intelligently written stories will. This series is one of my all time favorites, even though I do not really enjoy Science Fiction. The Riverworld series takes you realisically through what could be the afterworld. Farmer manages to put historical figures in to realistic fictional stories and draw on how they would really react. If L Ron Hubbard can spawn a religion with Dianetics, why can't Farmer's Riverworld?"
5,Thinking Man's SF- Innovative Idea in Science Fiction A++,"After death, wake up on the banks of a giant river-along with virtually everyone who has ever lived! Incredible story of ordianry people and famous historical figures on a quest to find the source of the river and the mysterious ""Ethicals"" who control it all. Great interaction between historic figures of different eras. One of the Farmer books you must have in your library-along with the other 4 in this mind-boggling series. Will become one of your alltime favorites"
2,Not exactly what I expected,"Unless every ruler in my house is wrong, the measurements of this chain are not accurately reported. The beads are 2mm rather than 3mm... Is it the end of the world? No, I didn't send the necklace back, but I would have preferred what 3mm which is what I thought I was ordering. Also with the clasp included, the necklace is a little longer than 22"". Had I known all this, I would have ordered a larger bead size and a shorter chain length."
5,terrific from first to last,"This set is nothing short of miraculous. Krainev does an astonishing job of bringing poetry to this music, which makes great technical demands. He finds the lyricism that underlies Prokofiev's percussive piano style. The orchestral accompaniment is also perfectly judged, vivid without overwhelming the soloist. The quality of the recording is ideal. I am a big fan of Telarc audio engineering, and this is among the best."
4,Panache That Pays,"This is a great guide for anyone that needs a brush up on etiquette. Great for young adults, recent college graduates. I have given these out at campus programs at the university where I work. Very easy text, catchy and appealing to all. Doesn't go over insane amounts of etiquette, but offers very helpful information. Definitely recommend!"
4,Covers a broad range of topics,This book nicely touches upon a variety of topics in terms of proper protocol. A friend lent it to me and was concerned it was out of date..but proper protocol is timeless. Brooks Brothers also offers a variety of books for ladies and men.
1,"Hideous rotoscoped monstrosity, so ugly my eyes bled.","Avoid this ""film"" like the plague. Not only does it visually rape a great work of literature but the animation is so bad it should be criminal. Who gave Ralph Bakshi the green light on this smoking pile of dung? If you dont know what rotoscoping is they basically paint over a real film. The effect is hideous and jarring. The film is not worthy of more credit than it receives, it is only worthy of being cast in to a well.Please do yourself a favor and skip this one. Buy the novel instead."
2,"Weird animation, this movie doesn't make sense!!","This is, above all, the weirdest movie I've ever seen! These freaky little elves with big, hairy feet go out to find some stupid ring that, when you put on, it kills you. But then when you take it off, you're alive again, lame. The plot makes no sense at all. This video got two stars from me only because the Dark Riders look really cool. Don't waste your money on cheap junk like this, people, get a good movie like Dr. Seuss' How The Grinch Stole Christmas, that movie clearly explains my definition of a good movie."
2,Not as good as The Hobbit and Return of the King,"It doesn't make sense to me that the director completely changed the look and style of animation in this film from The Hobbit and Return of the King. Why didn't they just stick with the same director? A series should have the same look and feel throughout the story. I kept checking the disc cover to see if I had bought the wrong one. The rotoscope animation is completely annoying and distracting. It felt like they were in a rush to complete the film and just stuck the rotoscope animation to complete it. If it was possible to understand the full story without buying this film, that's what I would recommend, but unfortunately it's not."
1,"Re-mastered or not, this movie was bad!","""The Hobbit"" and ""The Return Of The King"" tried to be good movies, and were... for the most part, successful!But this movie was bad!1. This movie was too dark!2. This movie was too violent for it's PG rating!3. Why does the whole prologue sequence look like it was filmed through cheese cloth?!4. Why does Aragorn (a.k.a. Stryder) look Native American?!5. Why does Boromir look like a Viking?!6. When Gandalf was talking to Frodo about Gollum, he said nothing of elves, and yet Samwise saidthat he heard him talk about elves!7. Why does Sam seem like a cross between Poky Pig and Jar-Jar Binks?!8. Why is Saraman called Araman 80% of the time?!9. He's Saraman the white, not Saraman the red!10. Why does the Balrog look so fake?!Overall, this movie is a major disappointment to fans, including me!My grade: D or one star!"
1,The Animated Masterpiece,I wish that some sopossed fans of the lord of the rings would stop saying how bad it is just because its old and the animation isn't as good as the Peter Jackson version.Some people say it misses out alot of the book but the new one misses out abit more but has scenes that were not in the books.Some of the people who read this will say they missed out tom bombadil but so does Peter Jackson. I shall give this five stars because it is good for the time and has good acting in it. I like this film as much as i like the New one
2,Lacking Continuity with Orson Bean fims!?,"If you enjoyed the Hobbit then you will probably be disappointed with this as the 2nd in the animated series (3 Total). It is over stylized with a mix of animation and live action background and just seems really over-produced because it is the namesake.The HobbitandThe Return of the Kingare consistent and both very entertaining, but unless you are looking to just complete your collection this movie is not really worth the price unless you are buying a WELL USED copy.As a side note, if you have children both the Hobbit and Return of the King are fine for them to watch as tales of morality, but this film is a bit more violent and graphic in its depictions of gore. It also attempts to 'frighten' the audience more with flashes, bangs, and dark characters causing mayhem. Don't know if Orson Bean is still living, but he needs to make a Lord of the Rings film to make up for this mess of a film."
3,Fabulous but unfaithful to Tolkien,"I have watched this movie more often than I can count and I enjoy it every time. The animation is superb and Ralph Bakshi did a great job of blending humans and animation long before Robert Zmeckis did ""Roger Rabbit."" Bakshi's depiction of the Nazgul and the Orcs of Mordor and Isengard is chilling. Sadly, Mr. Bakshi strays too much from Tolkien's text and story line. The chronology of the books is ignored in some places and several of the names and indentities of characters are either mispronounced or misplaced. Glorfindel is replaced by Legolas entirely and we never get to see Denethor or the Eorlingas. Moreover, Bakshi never finished the story and the films ends after the battle of Helm's Deep. Nonetheless, Ralph Bakshi was able to put together a visually stunning example of the one of the greatest pieces of literature ever written; I love it despite it's flaws."
5,how we forget,"Just read some of the reviews with a shaking head.When released this film was state of the art in terms of animation technology.The reason it ends so abruptly is that the intention was to finance the second film (last part of Two Towers and Return of the King) with the proceeds from the first.Sadly, lack of revenue did not allow that to happen.Personally, even as a Tolkein fan, I like the film."
4,"The Lord of the Rings, according to Bakshi","I agree with the many reviewers that this is a classic. The animation style was, of course, poorly done, but it was good other than that. They did the Ringwraiths quite well, better than the metal creatures of Peter Jackson. As a matter of fact, this film was more to Tolkien's work than Peter Jackson's adaptation in many ways. The Elves were more Elvish, the Dwarves more Dwarvish. Of course, the fact that it cuts off half-way through is most unfortunate, and the aforementioned poor mixing of animation styles comes off as bizaare. But if you can overlook these faults, overlook the animation, and see the story, I highly recommend this movie."
3,Worth a look for sentimental value...,"The reviewer below is wrong about this version being pan and scan. It IS in widescreen (16:9 format). However, on the box is states that there is a trailer on the disk. This is wrong, there is no trailer. As for the film, not bad I suppose. I bought it purely for sentimental value and watched it wearing extremely thick rose-tinted spectacles. For die hard fans of this version only."
4,Just like I remembered,"Brought back fond memories of watching this as a kid, B.PJ. (Before Peter Jackson). It was great, fond memories for me"
4,"Come back, come baaack! To Mordor we will take you!","This was and is a really cool animation, and the only mistakes they made in the making was cutting to much out of the original story. Also, they didn't continue on to makeThe Two Towers and The Return Of The King."
2,"Nice, but...","Many people are put off by the animation combining traditionnal ""cartoon"" and blurred ""real actors"". I found this, however, highly interesting. I had the impression of watching a dream instead of a movie, something fantastic that you can believe and deny at the same time.However, this movie, as stated elsewhere, only covers the first book and a brief part of the second. Just as all the characters undergo different quests, the narrator announces us that ""Frodo and his friends freed Middle-Earth from evil"", or something like that... A big, big disappointment. :(Oh well..."
2,What was that??,"Yes, it was made in 1978 with a newer film type, but what happend to the ring?Where did merry and pippin go, where did frodo and sam go?? It just stopped....nothing more than that, if you didnt read the books than you would be sooo lost. And Aragorn and Boromir would you please put on some pants!"
2,I thought I would love this.....,"I used to go to sleep watching one of the LoTR movies almost every night. I still have most of the lines memorized.Long story short: this movie is bad, but if you love LOTR it might be worth renting to check it out. Be aware that you'll probably spend an hour waiting for it to get better, then realize you're halfway through and want your $3 and 1 hour of time back. Most of the lines are either passive-aggressive, cranky, or just don't fit; other parts are rushed and not fulfilling. I didn't expect any flashy graphics (the movie was made in 1978). I expected a good story telling experience, and this movie does not deliver that.I'm still glad amazon had this online because I wanted to see it. I couldn't find it on netflix stream or blockbuster on demand."
2,DISGRACE TO THE STORIES!!!,"This Warner Bros. version of the classic J. R. R. Tolkien books has got to be the worst adaptation. First of all, the animation is dark but nicely done in a way. But sometimes it's TOO dark that you suddenly begin to lose interest. Second, the Special-FX are just dumb and pathetic. They try to mix poorly made realistic images in with the animation. And finally, some things in the books were obviously left out in this! The story goes through the entire ""Fellowship of the Ring"" and half of ""The Two Towers"", making it incomplete! OVERALL: The fight scenes are cheesy and poor, and most of it makes the wonderful books of the series look BORING! I recommend ""The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"" on DVD and the ""Two Towers"" (now in theatres) instead of this dull film."
2,"cared little, cared little still","I first saw The Lord of the Rings 3 or 4 years ago. The first hour was rather intersting, but after that the story became disjointed, confusing, and boring. Plus, it relied TOO MUCH on rotoscoping to the point when it seemed like the whole movie was in rotoscope. Needles to say, I left the room to get a snack and never came back. The recent release squashes this early effort to bring J.R.R. Tolkien's story to the screen,"
1,impossible to overlook the flaws in this horrible adaptation,Obviously an unfinished work which should never have been released to the public. Horrible animation! I imagine that everyone who was involved in this project are all groaning because of the new attention it is receiving and wishing that whatever money grubbers decided to release this in DVD just to ride the wave of Peter Jackson's success had thought better of it. You should get paid to watch this.
3,So bad it's good.,"It's not bad, it's not good, it's not mediocre, & it's not forgetable. What it is is bizarre & entertaining. As Youtuber FierceMundy so elequantly put it ""I cant help but watch; Like driving past a car crash.""Some people who watched this in early youth found the rotoscoping very unsettling & creepy. Today we can look back on it as a terribly cheap cheat in animation. The production quality is like what you'd expect from a student film; one film student, one animation student, & a bunch of student actors in cheap costumes.The campiness of it is where the real entertainment value comes from, such as the boss monster Gandalf fights what resembles a butterfly-winged minotaur. The shadow show in the beginning & the final battle are aslo very silly. If you watch the movie in slow motion, the characters often make the most hillarious faces, especially Samwise & Bilbo."
3,AVERAGE AT BEST!,"Ralph Bakshi's ""The Lord of the Rings"" offers a mixed bag of treats for Tolkien fans. While the voice talents and music are well done, some of the animation, including ""rotoscoping"" live-action stuff, is a bit cheezy. This is less about friendship and sacrifice than it is about watching the scenes of ""acid rock"" where you feel like you've stepped into a drug film rather than an epic tale of good versus evil. The battle of Helm's Deep is a good example. You're distracted from the battle by all the ""acidy"" colors.This ""Lord of the Rings"" is both good and bad. I recommend it only to those who already love it to begin with. As for others, I recommend Peter Jackson's acclaimed trilogy.Grade: C+"
1,ok now they have gone too far.,worst movie ever never agian i am going to see this oh no! harry potter is a most better movie [....]
4,The animation/live action is a little freaky.,"I loved the 1977 Animated Hobbit and remember watching this maybe once. The animation/live action was generally panned when I was a kid, but I liked it and still do today."
1,Don't bother. Just read the book.,The voice acting is poor and the rotoscope animation is jarring. It's more than a little painful to watch. I don't recommend it.
2,Meh,"For what it is and when it was made its probably not without merit. As much as I wanted to like this movie, just couldn't"
5,One great story to rule them all.,This animated version of Tolkien's work is an excellent addition to the collection of any fan who has enjoyed this tale for the ages.
4,I give it a 4,"I would have to give this a ""4"" because being from 1978 it's a little cheesy sometimes but the animation is very good.--peter --jn 3:16"
4,J. R. R. Tolkien is the greatest writer of all time......,"If you are a fan of J. R. R. Tolkien's work, you will appreciate this movie. It only completes 2/3's of the actual LOTR trilogy however it is true to the books and the cinematography for it's time is very well done. I recommend you read the books first, then see the movie.Or if you want to enjoy the movie for what it is and you aren't really a J. R. R. Tolkien fan, just see the movie!!! You will enjoy it for what is it....a great movie."
5,"Understand the flaws, still love the movie","The best criticism of this movie can be found by searching the internet for ""flying moose bakshi"" and selecting the first result. The review is hysterically funny and right on the mark.That said, I still love Bakshi's version. The rendition of Smeagol is definitive, far superior to the depiction in Jackson's movies. Frodo is not a complete and total wuss, as depicted by Jackson. Aragorn is properly shown to be much older and wiser than the Jackson version. God help me, I even like the music better in the animated movie.Not to mention that Bakshi gives us Orcs that don't look and act like they came from professional wrestling, and the subtleties in the Bakshi version are missing from what Jackson gives us. The Jackson movie favors action, the Bakshi version favors story telling. I'll take the latter any day of the week."
3,Seriously flawed telling of Tolkien's trilogy!,"There's a lot to like in Ralph Bakshi's version of the Lord of the Rings story, but this was a far from perfect film! Bakshi has a bad habit of rushing through some important parts of the book, then slowing down BIG TIME for other scenes (e.g. the flight across the ford, and the battle of Helm's Deep). The result is that there are times when this movie gets REALLY BORING! The same can be said of the animation --- when it's good, it's great! But then he goes through these ""short-cuts"" with live action posterized video and, well, the whole film suffers as a result. Still, Tolkien fans will want to see it. I know I did!"
3,It's flawed but interesting,"It's the Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers crammed into one movie! Given that they had to cut large swaths out, what is here is in some ways truer to the books than Peter Jackson's movies, although it lacks the visual splendor. The movie is mostly animated, except for some scenes which were rotoscoped (traced over live characters). The animation isn't top quality, and while some like the rotoscoping I personally hated it and thought it really clashed with the animation, especially several scenes that mixed the two technologies together. Yet some scenes and dialogue are done very well and it's worth owning if you are a Tolkien fan and don't mind movies with (severe) flaws."
2,"OK. Decent Retelling, Interesting, sometimes obnoxious animation.","It is a fairly decent telling of the story. However, the animation alternates between very crude and what I've been told is ""rotoscope"". The switching between the two is especially distracting in my opinion. I would have preferred straight animation throughout. While I would not watch it again, our five year old liked it and liked trying to figure out what parts matched his LOTR Legos game. If I could, I'd probably give it 2.5 stars.My primary complaint is that this movie should be included with unlimited prime streaming. Definitely not worth an actual purchase, IMHO."
3,lord of the rings,"I remember this from my childhood. A good try, although not as good as the live action movies. Dialog is off and it seems like things were added that weren't in the books. I bought this as a nostalgia piece to go with the hobbit. I didn't even realize they had done the return of the king, which I also bought."
3,Look for the sowrd that was broken....,"This may not be the best animated movie in the world, but it stays true to the books for the most part. It follows the books all the way to the battle of helms deep.Bilbo Baggins has left the Shire, and left Frodo his magical ring. Soon, Frodo finds out that Bilbo's ring is ""the one ring to rule them all"" and seeks to destory the ring in Mt. Doom in the land of Mordor where it was made. Worth watching once."
2,Dreadful in Comparison,"I saw this back in 1978 and thought it was disappointing mixture. Now I know why I haven't seen it in years. It is now sad to watch. The introduction of the Balrog made me burst out in laughter! It's a guy with a lion's head on and motionless paper wings! Everyone has commented on the music by Leonard Rosenman. I found it repetive, annoying, and unable to involve me in any events on screen. The only saving grace with this movie is as cheap as it seems, it does present the story in a pretty direct way, and though that, you get involved with Tolkien's story."
1,Saw this when it first came out...,"I can't belive anyone would like this ridiculous piece of junk...I'm sorry but Bakshi has no idea how to do good animation. It is sloppy and stupid, half the scenes you couldn't even see unless Gandalf or Legolas were in the frame.AND HOW ON EARTH can anyone compare this to the recent films?Just because the occasional dialouge is done correctly how can that make up for Boromir looking like a reject from Monty Python's Spam skit, or all the HUGE gaps in the plot!!!Oh my God folks must really be Peter Jackson haters and not have read the books to even think this piece of terrible, sloppy animation and ridiculous characterization is in any way better than PJ's recent films....The ONLY thing good about this film is the music score, that was very well done, it is shame the film wasn't any good."
1,Christopher Guard - The Lord of the Rings,"While it is true that at the time of its creation, animation was the only form of visual media that could even come close to capturing Tolkien's world, this movie is none the less a horrible scar on my memory. For pity's sake, spare yourself, your children, your friends, do not watch this movie, do not poison your minds eye with its imagery. Unless you seek to degrade the power and beauty of the Lord of the Rings, go elsewhere."
1,Huge Tolkien Fan,"As a Tolkien fan, it was painful to watch. So many things were wrong when compared to the books. I believe that it was a waste of my money, and I should have never bought it. At least I have one more LOTR item."
4,Why does Amazon only carry part 1 of the series?,"Amazon does not carry The Hobbit(1977), or the continuing episode(s) to the first LOTR cartoon(1978)...For $2.99, this cartoon should come complete w/ the entire series. What a rip off.It's a good cartoon, but it's not worth $3.00 to watch the 2nd episode of a series alone."
5,Fantasy Fantastic,I read the books in the early 70's and passed them on to friends. I still have a set in the house and recently bought all the movies. The movies are not quite up to the books but the last ones are close. I throughly enjoyed them.
4,great movie,My absolute favorite movie in the whole wide world.it's a shame that there wasn; a sequal. the best part about the whole movie were the songs.If you have an SNES Play the video game it has great RPG action.
4,sequel of sorts available,"I absolutely loved the video Lord Of THe Rings and was extremely upset that Ralph Bakshi never made the second half...However, I recently saw 'The Return of the King' which is available on video from Amazon.com and it completes the story. The animation is excellent although some of the songs date it a bit... It is by the same team that made the animated classic 'The Hobbit' which is also excellent... So if like me, you were dissapointed Bakshi never finished the Lord sequel then checvk out Return of the King as it is purely based on the last Tolkien book and covers the ending pretty well..."
5,Mezmorizing movie and timeless story.,The Lord of the Rings is a must for fantasy fans as well as fans of animation. This movie takes me away to Middle Earth and all of its fantastic places every time I see it.A remarkable achievement by Ralph Bakshi and the animation staff! Can't wait for the Trilogy! FRODO LIVES!!
1,The worst example of animation in HISTORY!!!!!,"Though the music is much better than the Hobbit's, this movie is appalling! The Animation is too dark and sketchy, as if painted by a child. You can see the animation budget shrinking as the movie progresses. I give it one star because it follows the book so closely, but it ends with at least 300 page of the book missing and Bakshi never completed the second half. I own this film, I think it's a waste of time and even if he did finish the sequel, I would not want to tarnish my memories of the book with it."
4,AN EPIC MUSIC MATERPIECE,I love the music for this movie! I mean the movie is fine and all but the soundtrack is great! There is one very good reason why I like the music so much ..... the hobbit music. You see this music the most at the end credits of this movie. It got stuck in my head for a whole day! Enough about the music on to the movie! I loved the portrayle of Sam. I liked his voice better than Sean Astin's whole perfomance. Michael Schols did a great job.
1,this movie dose not deserve 1 star,"if we could divide this movie into 3 parts they would be: the ... atempt of a plot, tolkiens' greatest hits, and lets all fight a lot. what do I mean you ask? well here's a few examples a:Gandalf and Frodo start to have a conversation so they start to walk outside why you ask? well because its easier to draw gandalf making huge motions with his arms wich he coud not do inside where they had the conversation in the book! B: in this ... atempt of a movie Boromir is some sort of furry viking, not to mention Grima Woumtounge looks like the love child of a human and a jawa from star wars. C: not to mention they start to highlight the best part of tolkiens work without the ""boring things"" wich hold the story together. D: finaly during the last part the movie all they show are gory fights. On one last note my personal thoery is that when this movie was released tolkien didn't turn but started to spin around in his grave"
2,Not the greatest,"For some reason, despite the year this was released, I had some great expectations for this movie. I was sorely disappointed. I can now see why they ran out of time in finishing the whole story; they dwell way too long on certain scenes! The scenes with the wraiths takes forever to get through, while other parts of the story are simply ""skimmed"" over... The technology used for certain animations (like the riders of Rohan and the orcs) was just a distraction in my view, it did not blend well with the rest of the ""hand-drawn"" animations.I cannot bring myself to recommend this to anyone. If you are not a fan of JRR Tolkien, you will not care to see this movie. If you are, you will just be disappointed with what you see."
3,A Fair Film,"This film has some high points but ultimatly levels out as average. Although faithful to sutle events, major occuences seem to be fast-forwarded. Lorien, for example, is reduced to three short scences. Aragorn says they will go there and all of a sudden Galadriel is welcoming the Fellowship! There is barely any of The Two Towers present. Although I like the Animation, inserting real people induces headaces. I can understand leaving out Glorfindal and Tom Bomadil, but why cut out important characters like Eomer?What really kills this film is the Costume design. Why place Men is ridiculos looking Tunics? They loook like dresses! And Legolas' outfit screams disco. One more gripe. Gimli is hardly in the story, and he is more major then Eomer.Recomend to parents of young Children who have had Tolkien read to them and want to see a movie, since Jackson's version is too intense for young children."
4,Use some imagination,"Most people thought it was a bad movie because of bad animation and portrayal of Sam and that monster (at the end) being a lion with butterfly wings etc... I might agree with the Sam and Lion with wings comments, but I cannot agree that the animation was bad. It is very raw. Thats exactly why it is so good."
1,Great disappointment for a Tolkien fan,"I suppose I was expecting too much. My friends and I were such fans of the movie that we eagerly anticipated it when it first came to theaters (now long ago). We were all greatly disappointed.The animation is cheesy and boring. The images do not remotely capture any grandeur or spectacle nor do the evil minions inspire any fear or loathing.The acting was lame. The adaptation of the story was hideous with gross omissions and many bad choices.The music was the best thing about it, and to be honest, I found it too strident."
3,"One of those ""intolerant fans"" of the books","What the Amazon reviewer fails to note is that Bakshi's film only loosely approximates the general plot of the Lord of the Rings. He presents what is basically a hurried synopsis, while devoting plenty of time to his repetitious, looping rotoscope nightmares. Then he ends when he runs out of money, one supposes, some where about two thirds of the way through the story. The end. Huh?"
3,The Lord of the Rings,"One can only know that director Peter Jackson's stunning ""Lord of the Rings"" movie trilogy has well over-shadowed animator Ralph Bakshi's animated version. The good things about ""The Lord of the Rings"" animated movie are: that it is exciteing to watch; the animated action sequences are great; and the music (score) is superb. The bad things about this movie are: that it greatly deviates from author J.R.R. Tolkien's book trilogy at some points; a process called rotoscoping was used and proved to be O.K., or, to many, a failure; and the fact that this movie was never completed is utterly dissapointing. But, we must all understand that animator Ralph Bakshi's ""Lord of the Rings"" animated movie is not bad. It is in my opinion that it is an average movie at best and we all must also understand that he tried; and thats what matters the most. I think that this movie is actually pretty good if you ask me."
3,Been a very long time since I watched this...,"Own it on VHS. My memory of it was that it was ahead of its time, and very good at bringing out the essence of LoTR. I bought the BD yesterday at COSTCO and only watched it through until the hobbits get to Weathertop. I find that I am not interested in it anymore. The animation is good, however the adaptation of LoTR is at best just OK. I'd rather re-read the books (am currently: about the 30th read) and/or re-watch the extended version of Jackson's DVDs. I will give my BD to the local library."
2,What were they thinking?,"The only reason I gave this film 2 stars was because alot of the dialogue was used by Peter Jackson in the live-action version and I can't love that without liking some of this film. But really, that's were it ends. The animation was bad, the score was bad, the characterizations were bad, and the storyline stunk.Aragorn looked like a freak. Samwise was brain-dead and Legolas looked less like a elf and more like a little girl.I saw the documentary in The Two Towers and in it, Peter Jackson mentioned that he borrowed from this animated version. Clearly, that's what he did but he also improved upon it. By doing so, he made his task alot easier.Anyway, there's really no point in buying or renting this cartoon because there's nothing that this version does that beats the live-action films. Don't waste your money, stick with the Jackson versions."
5,As Expected,"Received the DVD as expected, in a timely fashion.The movie itself is verrrrryyyy trippy. A very different version (obviously) than Peter Jackson's adaptation. The movie is kind of long, but it does include a portion of The Two Towers. I'm glad I watched it - I can't be a true LotR fan without having seen it. That being said, I dunno if I would watch it again. But definitely a must see (at lease once) for any LotR fan."
2,terrible!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This movie is NOT very good!!! It focused on the story well, and followed the book, but the animation was terrible; it looked like they rushed it. Also, they end the movie in the middle of the 2nd book, with nothing concluding at all. They're in a battle near Rohan, and it just ends and says something like, ""They won the battle and conquered all of Middle Earth!"", and Frodo and Sam are just left there on Mordor's border, without getting rid of the Ring, which is the whole point of the story! It sort of makes me think that they ran out of money or funding at the end of the movie- I wouldn't be surprised!"
5,very good (an opinion from Mexico),"After years(this version of the Tolkien novel is from 1978), this film is now on DVD (with subtitles in español, francais, portugués, mandarin, thai, korean and japanese!). Thanks god this is a widescreen version (the horrible VHS version was pan & scan). Critics dont like very much this version of a classic, but the Ralph Bakshi animation is great (his best film until now)."
3,THE ONE RING TO RULE THEM ALL,"I admite that there are problems for this picture:the half live action sceens look odd and out of sorts,the dull animation, and the music is blaring at times.there are however some good things about it: the general story,the nazgul,the charitures,and so on. i have read and enjoyed the books, and find that this work stays mostly near the story told by tolkien. all in all I dont think this movie is a total loss. its good for those who like tolkien, not as good as the books but still not bad. to get a full story of all these events you have to read the books. to see what happens to our heros on the tv screen after the events of this film you'll just have to see THE RETURN OF THE KING animated movie. ( i cant wait till the live action movie comes out.)this movie is good, espesily for tokien fans shuch as myself."
3,Fair and far from the book as well as incomplete....,"Most movies don't compare with their books but this one just doesn't do the book any service. It's Ok but it's a dissappointment after reading the book. Too many parts and details left out that are important. With todays technology, I would love to see a company like Disney take this story and re-create it. If they can do The Lion King, Mulan, Price of Egypt and Pocahontas ( sp?), then they should be able to do LOTR. Only drawback is it's a long tale, but then again there's the movie called ""The Never Ending Story"" which is a cool fantasy. Other wise I would suggest a full blown mini series with real live characters and actors. What a fantastic movie that would make. The books were fantastic. The video was not. The Lord of the Rings deserves a greater opportunity visually. Hoping to see a re-created version sometime soon."
2,not so good,I didn't like this movie...It was kind of boring and the painted on people really looked stupid...I prefer the hobbit and the return of the king animated movie over this one...
1,Poor Movie.,"this is a very bad movie. It's not like the book or the the movie that is out today. If you have seen it, hopefully you didn't like it. If you have not seen it, don't! It stinks!Rated: PGRunning Time:133 Minutes"
2,What Gives With The Fullscreen!!!,"Fist Of All I Liked The Original Dvd That Came Out A Few Years Ago, So This Review Is About The Deluxe Edition. I Never Seen The Movie Before Till I Bought The Dvd. The Animation Was Good But The Rotoscoping Was To Me Not Really Needed. It Must Of Been An Attempt To Enhanced The Action Scenes And Create Ooh's And Aah's For The Audience At That Time In '78. Calling Saruman ""Aruman"" Twice I Believe Was A Little Strange As Well. My Beef Is For The Fullscreen Release Of The Deluxe Remastered Version, What Gives?! Don't Waste Your Money, Get The Original Dvd Release If You Can Find It. The Original Was In Widescreen And So Is The Remastered Deluxe Blu Ray Version! What Gives?!!"
1,The one thats not a cartoon is better,"This movie was horible, if your going to buy this for your famliy to watch this is a bad famliy movie.The Balrog,orcs,nazguls,and goblins are scary for the little ones and Sam's face is weird. This is not a famliy movie.I donot recommend this movie."
3,Review for Animated Hobbitt-1977 Release and LOTR,"As a young child, the film impressed me. Its animation is poor by modern standards, but the music and faithfulness to the script and characters make it a worthwhile watching. John Huston is the perfect voice for Gandalf and Brother Theodore is excellent as Gollum. If you are a fan of Peter Jackson's LOTR series, the animated version of LOTR is similar to the Hobbitt. Both are plagued with substandard animation, but are faithful to the storyline and include much more music. While the animation of mobile characters isn't great, the actual settings are well done and accurate, including all towns visited."
3,Ok for its time,"Ok for its time, the animation, the way the story was told, it was ok for its time. But if you would compare it to PJ's movies, yes it would suck BIG TIME. What really made me like this edition is that its music score is very good, maybe even comparable to Howard Shore's score on the current LOTR."
1,Missing item,"There isn't much I can add to the already formidable commendations for this DVD.Like all of the other reviewers, I grew up with this fine work by Ralph Bakshi.Needless to say, the release of this item got me very excited.However, I was quite disappointed by the misleading listing on the DVD cover.The DVD was described as containing a theatrical trailer when none was included.I have yet to discern the reason for this.Needless to say, I feel quite cheated by this discrepancy."
3,Bakshi wasn't better,"This film ends all too abruptly, and fans of the Tolkien masterpeice must be warned that Peter Jackson's trilogy is way better. There are too many mistakes, Saruman is too often called 'Aruman', Celeborn is pronounced 'Seleborn', the balrog in Moria is able to fly (?!), and there too many more, irritating, errors in this film. It's not the stuff for hardcore Tolkien fans."
2,what a shame warner brothers,What happen here. esta es la produccion filmica de cartoons peor transferida a bluray.Es una verguenza que haya salido al mercado sin depurarla mejorDebo reconocer sin embargo que tiene un excelente doblaje al espanol.Es una falta de respeto al publico cinefilo que la warner brothers la haya sacado al mercado solo por sacardinero sin ofrecer un mejor producto. Es una verguenza.
2,The Lord of The Rings Cartoon movie,"I love the books and the recent movies, but I hated the cartoon. If you've read the books you'll realize that the cartoon does them no justice, but if you haven't read the books you won't understand the cartoon. Also in afew scenes the cartoon images are spliced with real people. (although this can be forgiven because of limited technology in 1978. Overall I give it two stars."
2,Are they serious?,"Just a blatant attempt at making money to re-release this DVD in the year 2010. Save your money and save your childhood memories (the only reason I gave it 2 stars and not 1). The nearly 3 hours you will spend re-watching this will feel like a betrayal of the childlike innocence you came to this film with, if it was your introduction to Tolkien. Some things are best left in the past."
2,junk when compared to Peter Jackson's adaptation,"On its own this film may have been impressive for its time I very much doubt that special effects in the late 1970s would have made for a very good live action Lord of the rings film. Bakshi was a talented animator but he just didnt have the budject for this film. The anamation is horrible in over half the film. Boromir's viking costume is absurd. The live action scenes are laughable. The only part I found impressive was the battle at Helms Deep. But the abrupt ending and butchered stroyline doesnt do the film any good. John Hurt, as Aragorn, was the only voice actor I found to be convincing as a character, but Aragorn's character design was so terribly bland that it just didnt work. The rest of the voices are terrible. Bad film stick to Jackson's trilogy"
4,Overly Criticized and Underated,"So what happened when two of my favorite things, Lord of the Rings and Bakshi's unique animation came together? One of the least appreciated and most overly ridiculed attempts at translating Tolkien's works to the screen. Having read the books since the third grade I am more than ready to admit that Bakshi's vision has its share of problems. However he was making lemons into lemonaide. After the horror of the Rankin Bass Hobbit, the mutilation of such a great book complete with cheesy 70's folk music, This was a welcome change. Definitly incomplete, being only 1 and a half of the trilogy, it saddens me that they never completed this version. What ever you do, DO NOT seek comfort in the arms of the Rankin Bass ""Return of the King,"" or may the torturous song ""Frodo of the nine fingers"" be forever burned into you memory. You have been warned!!!"
2,Went well until the end,"Well, I must say, when I first started to watch the movie, it was pretty good, and by that I mean faithful to the books. What killed it for me though was horrible animation they tried to put in. I am not sure exactly what it is called, but it involves substituting animation with live people who seem to be scribbled on. What I don't understand is why did they do this? It just slaughtered my enjoyment during the movie. Maybe for 1978 that was considered top of the line animation, but they should have just stuck with the original animation.The ending killed me, it was like the person who made the movie only made it halfway through THE TWO TOWERS and decided to make a movie on it. It left so many loose ends I don't know where to begin with. My advice is to read the books and if you have 2 hours of spare time, watch this movie."
2,such a waste,"Just as a movie, I enjoyed it but compared to the books it is a shamble. Much of story is left out and the representation of the characters is awful. the best thing about ths movie is the music."
2,"Worth hearing, less worth seeing.","Most of the visuals are horrid, which is hard to explain, given that it was designed as an animated film. Most of the voiceacting, however, is very well done--there are a few line readings that I really prefer to Jackson's version, however better done that is overall.It should also be noted that this movie has the WORST Sam you will ever see. Apparently, the filmmakers couldn't get around the idea of there being working-class people in the Shire, and so, to explain his deference and devotion to Frodo, they turned him into some kind of dopey idiot with a bulbous nose. Honestly, he's an idiot. For the BEST Sam, see the Rankin-Bass Return of the King."
1,So bad it's good,"All the characterization is just SO over the top. When Gandalf is reciting ""One ring to rule them all, etc"" he paces the room and twirls around and makes these HUGE sweeping gestures. It just doesn't work. What I will give it, though, is that this makes the film ABSOLUTELY HILARIOUS! you have to watch it just so you can laugh at it."
1,Phew! The worst cartoon movie I ever seen!,"I thought that was in one set with ""Hobbit"" and ""Return of the King"", which were pretty nice cartoons. This is NOT!Poor artwork. Cheap looks. I had an impression that they were trying to save money.Shame upon the producer and the whole crew!Never buy this DVD."
1,What is this? - Peckinpaw does Tolkein?,"Like everything else Bakshi has done, this is overblown and over-the-top. Needlessly gory. Shock done for the sake of Shock, not to advance a story line. The two Rankin and Bass movies are among my all-time favorites. If only they had done this movie, too, ..."
1,A bad idea and not just because of the rotoscoping,"Without making obvious comparisons to Peter Jackson's work, this version of Lord of the Rings plays like a cheap Errol Flynn fantasy movie. The direction and choreography of the characters is sloppy and flat. I got no sense of urgency from what should have been moments of great tension."
3,Give it some credit...,"Ok, this is no masterpiece. The animation is poor at times, horrid at others. BUT, let's look at it for what it is. I first saw this movie when I was much younger, and it is what started my whole LotR fascination(?). And the DVD edition is much better than the VHS. You'll finally be able to see what is in the background. I spent the first 20 mins. of the movie rewinding, going ""I never knew there was a bridge there..."" ""Oh! Those are trees!""So, if you have never seen this movie, have read the books and liked Peter Jacksons film, this movie will no doubt disappoint you. Big time.But if you have seen it, and did like it , the DVD is defidently worth getting."
3,"A for effort, C- for result","I applaud Mr. Bakshi's *audacity* in trying to take on Tolkien with the technology he had in hand. Evidently a lot of hard work went into it, and the experimental use of rotoscoped live and traditional cel animation is very interesting.That said, the piece is a shambles from start to finish. Hammy acting, plot alterations, shoestring-budget seams blatantly showing... sigh. The other armchair critics in the review section have listed the shorcomings eloquently, so I won't rehash them here.Reread the Trilogy before seeing this animated version. At least then you won't be hopelessly confused come the ending credits."
4,"Wonderful Escapism for Tolkien fans, heartwarming film","First saw this animated adventure when I was about 8 years old and absolutely loved it and watched it time and time again. Then we got burgled and the tape was in the video recorder that got stolen. Anyway, fair play to Ralph Bakshi because I defy anyone to match his version in animation in 1978. Its fair to say he strayed chronologically and charachter wise but only slightly and alot of people have different mental pictures anyway. For me it is a classic, and like other people truely dissapointed his didn't complete with a sequel. Ralph Bakshi captured my imagination and stayed with the main plot of the book. To cover the book completely and in detail would take a dozen films. So can anyone out there help me in obtaining a copy. I am willing and able to pay good money for one."
3,Don't make a movie of half the trilogy w/out doing Part 2,This film has awkward animation and ends halfway through the trilogy. Pretty mediocre.
1,"IT BURNS US, IT BURNS US!!!!!!","This is just a poor film. It covers the FOTR and TT portions of the LOTR, just ending flat with no warning despite the title of LOTR. The characters here are just plain ugly, many are historical Earth (not Middle Earth) stereotypes that don't fit in or reflect the descriptions in the book at all. Samwise feels more like Dopey the Dwarf than the hobbit that helps save the free peoples of Middle Earth. The Balrog looks like a bipedal chimera in bell bottoms. The orcs look more like a cross between dogs and apes than elves taken my Melkor, tortured and aruined over the ages as is told. Many more such horrors abound through out the film, only they are perpetrated by the film makers not Sauron.If you are a collector you may want to buy this for completion of your collection, but I really wouldn't recommend watching it. It was a painful experience."
1,A piece of ...,"I'm sorry, but I don't understand why people constantly defend this film. ""Oh, it's not so bad. It was good in it's time. It's not fair to compare it to the new one.""I don't compare it! I saw this years ago, way before the new version came along, and I thought it was horrible then, by any standards! And I'll explain why in one (or two) words: roto-scoping!Here Bashiki had the hard task of cramming an epic story into what he originally thought would be one film! Then he wastes time and money with this animating over live action technique which does nothing but distract and detract precious screen time. Look, if he wanted to test out this new style, he should've done this with another film, not one as pressured of LOTR.And when he decided the film would not fully capture the whole epic, why stop at the battle of Helm's Deep of all places? At least stop in a place which seems right to stop at (like the places where the trilogy was originally divided, for instance)."
2,Strange grafix confusing story,"I read online that this was supposed to be pioneering graffix when it was made but I just thought it looked bad.. The film mixes cartoon animation with what looks like film negative of live action.The story of the Lord of the rings is fairly complex with lots of characters and the director must have thought the only people who would want to watch his cartoon would be people who have read the book and don't need to know whats happening or who the characters are, why doing what thier doing...etc...I did really enjoy the Hobbit and return of the King cartoons though."
4,Classic!,This is a great animation with creative imagery. It can easily be considered one of Bakshi's best work. I only wish there was a sequel and he completed the saga
5,GREAT BOOK for EVERY ONE.,"I have this book since 1984 when Tetsuko Kuroyanagi became a Goodwill Ambassador for UNICEF. I was in 7th grade at that time. I have read it over 20 times. Every time, I found joyful, happiness, and touching. But I lost it when we moved. I did get an used one. And I have read it over and over again. This book inspired me to study Japaneses. I love it. GREAT BOOK for children and for adult. READ IT if you want to find your childhood and refill your imagination."
5,understanding of a children mind,"Toto chan show us that it is up to the adult to understand children mind.Insted of the adult taking the lead ,let the child lead us.Make a child responsable for is actions:Give him/her choice not confrontation.Totochan ,thanks you."
5,great book,"This is a fantastic book about the life of a 1st grade girl with what would now be called ADHD, and almost every chapter is individually a nice moral story."
2,Playing without soul,"Solomon's playing of the Waldstein sonata and op. 54 is like hunting down a Czerny etude. All the beaty of these compositions is lost. The interpretations have no soul, pretty much like most recordings of Horowitz. Serious music lovers should get these Beethoven sonatas in recordings by Emil Gilels, Wilhelm Kempff, Claudio Arrau or Alfred Brendel."
4,Good Instruction!,"This DVD is a great instructional for beading on fabric, I really did learn from her step by step visual instruction, better than a book for me. I just would like to see beading on a stuffed doll, that is one of my reasons for purchasing this DVD. Didn't get that instruction. I can still use all the information shared here, so I still feel it was a good buy."
1,Avoid like the plague,"DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!I recently purchased this product and it's a greatDISPLAY SWORD, but nothing else. I e-mailed the manufacturer to get them to take down the BATTLE READY claim they had, saying I tested it and came up with a bent handle. They responded with ""well if you are not happy with the product return it for a refund."" claiming That I BROKE THE SWORD! I even went as far as reporting them to the better business bureau and they are sticking to their claim that I broke the sword and should return the sword for a refund. For the frustration I had to go to I strongly recommend NEVER doing business with Sunny and Omi sales.AVOID THEM LIKE THE PLAGUE!!"
3,Roadster kit for toddler,"My husband used this kit to make my toddler a ""sibling entry"" for her big brothers pinewood derby race. She won second place overall. Not bad huh. Great kit. Thanks"
1,Dull movie,I had a hard time following this - I was hoping to find a love story that I could show in a group of teenagers - this was certainly not it.
1,Oxygen Sensor not compatible,"Made Kia Rio run horrible. Ordered and installed one made by NTK, I believe to be the OEM supplier and that solved the problem."
5,Atomic Accuracy without the Radio !,"If you want a simple, ACCURATE and easy-to-read timepiece without the gizmos that abound today, this is it. I have owned this watch for about 18 months, set it via WWV (National Bureau of Standards) from my shortwave radio, and it has NEVER been more than 1/2 second off. It tends to drift about a half second either side of dead on, probably due to the effects of seasonal temperature variations on the quartz crystal timebase. I am simply amazed at it's accuracy."
1,Ours was a fake...,"I can't really comment on the actual Seiko watch because there is no way the watch I received for my husband was made by Seiko. The band was cheap and tinny sounding, with rough, unfinished edges. Such a disappointment on Christmas morning. Have returned it, waiting for a refund (to buy a real Seiko) not from amazon this time."
2,UGHHHHHHHHHH,WHen I ordered this book I thought I was ordering the Panorama book made by Vista. Instead they sent me the Vista made by Vista spanish book and when I bought it I couldn't return it because it had a no return policy. Moral of the story if it has no picture DO NOT go on ASSUMPTION that it'll be the correct book. UGH LESSON LEARNED!
5,Best Loppers Ever Made,"The Fisker loppers have metal power gears that do not allow them to slip. They are light to carry and cut easily up to 2"" + in diameter."
5,Fiskars 18-inch bypass cutters,"These are great cutters. Being owners of a pecan orchard, they have truly been put to the test and are the best ones we have found for the job! Great buy and great product."
5,Cuts Through Butter,"A friend loaned my wife a pair of these while she was struggling with traditional loppers. After using them for just a few minutes, she insisted on her own tool for Mother's Day. At 5ft 4ins the little woman can take out an amazing amount of brush in a short period of time. And of course I can't resist borrowing them myself. This is the greatest improved tool since the can opener. Yes, it really cuts limbs like a hot knife through butter."
5,Yet another masterpiece from Fiskars,"These loppers are incredible. I have cut through wood that would barely fit into the jaws when fully opened (1 3/4"" or so). My wife uses this to cut through 1"" limbs with no problem, and in comparison to standard (non-geared) loppers, the effort required is miniscule. Like all Fiskars products I've used, this feels well made, and is quite lightweight. I have no complaints at all, and honestly I can't see why you'd buy the 31"" version instead of these. Anything these can't handle i'm pulling out the chainsaw."
5,I can do yard work myself.,"I owned a pair of Fiskars before and they broke.....not knowing they had a lifetime guarantee, I threw them out. I tried using regular loppers and just couldn't do it. It was just too painful. Then I bought another pair of Fiskars loppers and I am doing my own pruning, etc. again. I will NEVER buy any other kind....the gears make any task easy for people with hand and wrist problems. I love not having to rely on other people to do the work I can now do myself."
2,A different lopper,"With its geared action and medium size, this is a very handy tool, suitable for a variety of jobs.On the plus side, its very light (compared with competitor products), comfortable, easy to use and cuts well. Unlike other loppers (such as the 17"" version from the same company), the cutting blade can be replaced which is a great bonus.On the down side is the unique jaw shape which probably prevents the slipping of the brunch during cutting, however, this feature requires maximal opening of the handles. The result - access to dense vegetation in narrow places is severely limited.(The parallel Felco loppers have a narrow jaw, and although higher in price, proved being much more practical for my use)."
5,LOPER 9625,"I loaned my wife,s loppers to some one. They never can back. They were the Fiskars 18 inch Power Gear Bypass Lopper. So I bought the new one's as a replacement. Had they not have been an ecellent lopper I would have bought another brand. I even bought the Fiskar Power Gear Lopper with the longer handles for myself. They work even better then they claim, stay sharp, and maintain alignment. Worth every penny."
5,iskars 18-Inch PowerGear Bypass Lopper #9625,"perfect length for average jobs, cuts like cutting butter, which is very true, keep it clean and well lube, and it cuts like nothing else, best lopper i'd used for sure, blade holds up very well, do wear gloves when using this, because of "" cancer causing materials"", if you have an i-phone, you probably familiar with these subjects."
4,Very funny,This is an old book as I remember my Mother reading it to me when I was a child. It is very funny and good light reading.
5,Brilliant,"Ok i admit i am only a new-found Current 93 fan, and as such have no right judging them on just one or two albums. What I can say for this one is that is absolute masterpiece. The music is as good as apocalyptic folk can be, whilst without sounding pretencious lyrics are truly philosophycal one of a kind wonder. I won't pretend I understand them all, but I am saying that you could easly transcript this album and sell the lyrics as philosphy in it's own right. Buy this cd you won't be sorry, David Tibet is one of those artists who puts my faith back into music."
3,A little disapointing,"I was a little dispaointed that this is simply the 3 playoff games and the superbowl....no commentary at all. I was expecting a narrated ""road to the Superbowl"" not just a rebroadcast of the games..."
3,Missing game 2,"This DVD was a gift for our son who is an avid Colts fan. Unfortunately, it was packaged with 2 #4 discs and no #2 disc. As luck would have it, he missed seeing the 2nd game of the playoffs so is pretty disappointed that the #2 disc is missing. I cannot find a way to contact Amazon.com,LLC. Do I have to return the entire set in order to HOPEFULLY get it right? If anyone can help me with this, I'd appreciate it."
3,great memories poor quality for 2007,"How can you beat and copy of the playoff run of your favorite team? COATS fan since the mid-70's the Bert Jones era, and have waited a long time for the Vince!The quality of the game could have been better and two of the games had scratches on them which surprised me, right out of the box. There is this crazy line at the top of each game, and I have no clue what that would be an it is annoying as hell at first then you kind of forget it is there, but in 2007 you can fame the presentation so that it is not visible.I enjoy seeing those games and will for a long time, for the money not a bad buy, again the quality of the picture could have been much better. I watch them on a macbook.GO COATS!!!"
2,Classic NFL Games in Blurry Vision,"I was so excited to get this set as I was finally getting what I asked for from the NFL: complete games and not highlight reels on DVD. So, I pop the disc in and low and behold... it's in 4:3 blurry vision. I've been watching NFL games in HD now for 4 years and was expecting 16:9 versions of the games (silly me; I forgot to ask for that too)! Not Blu-Ray versions mind you, but standard def 480p 16:9 enhanced games. Pretty basic stuff for 2007 if you ask me. I went back on-line to check if this was user error on my part and that it was me who picked the fool screen version by mistake. Unfortunately this is the only version available, so I'm gonna pass this set on to my dad who still watches fool screen. I hope this set gets a proper DVD release in the future.Guess it really was too good to be true.jd"
4,Would prefer actual TV game coverage......,"I had missed the championship game between Indy and New England. I was really looking forward to seeing it. I was grateful to get the chance to see it, even though I knew the outcome. But this video takes great license with the editing. I would have prefered to see it just the way it was on TV. With the replays, commentary and without the obvious jumps from the end of a play to the beginning of the next. Too much coverage was cut out of this game. But it was still fun to watch Brady get his butt kicked!"
3,"Useful, but insensitive.","While this book does have a good amount of useful advice, the author can sometimes be a little insensitive. For example, in the part about attending singles' events, she writes that the only men you'll find there are ""over-the-hill prowlers and socially maladjusted geeks."" Well, I'm a male, I attend lots of singles' dances, and yes, I guess my social skills are a little weak. Gee, thanks for your kind words of compassion. Perhaps a woman who refuses to consider someone without the deliverance of Robert Redford deserves to be single forever. She might meet someone with all the ""geekiness"" of Bill Gates.Oh, and by the way, over a year ago I met a nice woman at one of these events, and we've had a great relationship ever since. I'm sure glad she didn't read the book."
3,Super Reader,"A pretty straight adventure tale. Super enhanced Russian noble bastard, in the wedlock sense, escapes, and is on the lam.However, he is caught, in a brothel, no less, while being pursued by kabuki porn stars and laser shuriken armed ninjas, while swimming in a sake vat!A shafted conspiracy sends him on a mission to save a living goddess in a vast Himalayan mystical invisible fortress full of monks.He is, of course, pursued by his sadistic bastard-in-the-adjectival-sense war enemy and his book titled regiment.There is a decent twist at the end involving the head female ninja, and the second in command of the Imperial Black."
1,Meh.....,I agree with the other negative reviews - a bit too much sugar and cheese. I had to push myself to keep reading the book. 1/2 way through I started skipping like mad just to see how it ended. Horribly predictable and fluff character depth.Sad...I really liked Lady and the Wolf. This one didn't cut it.
1,Insipid,"I have read a few of Julie Beard's book before and really enjoyed them. This was not her best effort. The heroine was to weird to empathize with...and there were too many strange sub-plots. I liked the hero's brother more than I did him. I finished this book grudgingly, though it was hardly worth the effort."
2,WHAT A WASTE OF TIME,"I HAVE READ MANY OF JULIE BEARDS' BOOKS AND HAVE REALLY ENJOYED HER WRITING..BUT THIS BOOK WAS NOT UP TO HER USUAL..IT WAS SO SWEET I STARTED TO SUGER OVERDOSE AFTER ABOUT THE FIRST CHAPTER..THE HERO KEPT SAYING THAT HE DID NOT WANT TO BE HONORABLE ANYMORE AND THEN TURNED RIGHT AROUND AND DID EVERYTING HONORABLE..ALSO THE HEROINE WAS A MILK SOP..WHAT A WASTE OF TIME I DIDN'T EVEN FINISH THE BOOK..I WAS SO BORED..I READ ""A DANCE IN HEATHER"" AND LOVED IT SO WHAT HAPPENED JULIE ???? I HOPE THIS JUST WASN'T FOR THE MONEY...ALSO GOOD READ IS ""ROMANCE OF THE ROSE"" OR ""THE MAIDENS HEART"" BUT I WOULD STAY AWAY FROM THIS ONE."
5,Medieval Romance at its best!,"Julie Beard is second to none at writing memorable medieval romances. Her plotting is well researched, realistic, and always surprising. But her characters are the book's greatest strength. They have strong motivations and are complicated. When the heroine and hero finally come together--wow, I'm right there with them. This book is one of my favorites. A real keeper!"
2,dark,"This was my first Julie Beard book. The synopsis seemed interesting. I love romances set within this time frame. Well, I must say...this book was a lot darker than I had anticipated. Certainly not a 'sigh & swoon' like some by Garwoods, Deveraux, Mason, Crosby, etc. The female lead was pretty depressing, her dreams quite haunting. Overall, the mood was dark and I didn't feel a 'lift' at the end, even though love conquers all. I wouldn't really recommend this book to anyone...too heavy for romance, not quite heavy enough for goth. Disappointed."
3,"Not bad, but melts away!","When I first used this soap I was put off by the powerful lime odor. My boyfriend does smell good when he comes out of the shower, though. The soap does not do anything to clear up acne (I find Dr. Bronner's Hemp Tea Tree Oil Castile Soap helps, but can be a bit overly drying), though it makes your skin softer.The biggest problem I find is that the soap melts away and doesn't last long at all. We've gone through almost 2 of the 3 bars in a month!"
5,Kenny Rogers fan,"I actually have this on a record not a cd. I love the record. It has all my favorite Kenny Rogers' songs on it.This album, whether you have it on record format or cd format, is a must for all Kenny Rogers' fans."
3,Belongs on the coffee table...,"The best *looking*, but far from best, book I've found on triathlons. Its heavy, glossy pages with full-color photos make it very appealing on the surface, but sadly it lacks any depth. It offers cursory explanations of various aspects of the sport, and sprinkles in a little bit of good advice here and there, but that's about it as far as content goes. It fails to include some crucial aspects of training - such as weight training - completely!In the end, this book is ultimately better suited for your coffee table than your bookshelf. Complete newcomers to triathlons may get a little out of it, but I think anyone seriously interested in the sport would be better off reading The Triathlete's Training Bible by Joe Friel."
1,I loved it until I lost it two weeks after owning it due to bad belt clip design,"The case has what seems to be a neat function with interchangeable items such as a belt clip or desk stand, but since it is interchangeable it's also faulty. I was not listening to my player while riding on a crowded public train and when I got home all I had left was the belt clip itself. Not sure if it just fell off or was taken, but either way, I'd suggest not using it if you want to keep it."
1,do NOT buy this product,"I hate Apple and all Apple products so I was really excited to get this as a gift. It looks cool, has a removable battery, and has these sweet neon lights around the front panel.Too bad this things sucks. It's crashed twice on me now and I've had to send it back to the manufacturer. It's such a pain to reload all your music. Plus I was without music for a month when I had to send it back for repairs. It just froze up on me again and so I'm just going to throw it away and buy an Ipod Mini. All of my friends with Ipods never complain about crashing."
2,Nope,Still has terrible software. You have to wonder why Creative can't get this right. Looks nice but the conrols are awkward and the entire front is touch sensitive. You do get 1 more GB than an iPod mini. Screen review could be better. Apple stil does it better but needs to come out with a 5 gig mini.
3,Get a Rio Karma instead,"This device looks pretty nice but it's really not very competitive. The iPod mini is smaller and sexier, albeit limited in supported formats and the Rio Karma is a far better value. The karma is only $5 more, it's small, had a 20 gig drive and supports more formats including ogg. The karma doesn't look as sexy but it's interface is very efficiently designed. In fact, it's much better than the iPod in that regard. The karma also has a very long battery life. Having owned both the karma and other Creative Lab products (including Zen) I would have to say the Karma also sounds better. No comparison in my opinion."
4,Zen Micro-micro battery,"I basically like my Zen. The controls are a little hard to work somtimes, but generally give you a lot of options. The sound quality is great and the capacity is large! FM reception is somewhat spotty but it is a great feature to be able to record FM! The earphones are a bit large for my ears so I bought another brand. My major complaint is BATTERY LIFE. They advertise 12 hours but I have never got more than 4 hours (give or take 15 min.) of battery life. I have 3 batteries and they are all the same! I wish I got longer battery life....sigh."
5,Pretty Good... but not perfect... close though,"I would love to give this a 4.6 or something... but I had to round up.4/5 for shuffle... it likes to go +/- about 20 tracks on the playlist, so might play 2 songs of same artist in a row... but is usually good.5/5 for menu... very easy to navigate, nice conrols and features.5/5 extras... has replaceable battery... organizer, phone book, bookmarks and more... and it is easy to sync with pc.Only con is...3.5/5 Battery... it lasts like... 10 hours... but if you dont use it, the battery still gets drained very fast. Like... 2 days for all of battery, very very annoying.also, there is a firmware update online for it, and I heard it is supposed to make battery better. We will see...I recommend this or ipod. I kinda wish I had an ipod so it worked better with iTunes... but it still kinda does... but not as well as I would like."
2,"Great Features, Bad Headset connector design","I have had my Zen Micro for just under 6 weeks and already having to send it back for RMA. The headset connector has come lose and it turns out to be a very very common problem. Just search on creative's forums for headset and you will see (i.e. http://forums.creative.com/creativelabs/board/message?board.id=dap&message.id;=56952&query.id;=31991#M56952)I have had no other problems with the player, other than learning I need to upgrade the flash to be able to do subscription based MP3s.My recommendation would be to shy away from the player if you aren't doing subscriptions. Not many choices on the market for subscriptions, so if you choose a Micro treat it with care."
2,Good player but....,"Overall, it has been a good player. I have a few gripes though.1) lack of accessories -- hopefully this will change, but I've owned this thing for 6 months and just recently found an arm band that ""somewhat"" fits it.2) Battery life - the battery does not last very long at all3) malfunction - the player cuts in and out and requires me to move the headphones around quite a bit. i hear creative will replace it quickly, but I hate to have to reload the player and to go without it for however long it takes. Plus the pain of having to ship it.Other than these gripes, it has been a good player with a decent user interface."
1,BEWARE!,"All other shortcomings aside, like small storage space especially compared to newer models out now, simply transferring music to this device is very limited. Most operating systems do not recognize this device and the manufacturer offers very little support for patches to alleviate this problem. This can leave the product completely worthless unless you have access to a computer operating system that will recognize it and/or you're willing to jump through all kinds of hoops to try to get it to work even with limited abilities.Shop around, there are much better products with far more storage and no hassle to use and transfer files to it, and for less money."
1,JUNK!,I bought a 6gb Micro in 4/06..after several months the screen locked up...I tried everything including a new battery...$200 bucks in the trash!Don't buy Creative anything..terrible product....... terrible company..
2,Good--When it Worked,"This MP3 player is packed with features but all that means nothing if it doesn't work. My headphone jack began to fail after just 3 months of ownership and wouldn't work without contant jiggling. The hard drive failed just outside the warranty period. I deposited the device in the trash and purchased a Sandisk Sansa player. It's much nicer, slimmer, has no hard drives to fail and contains all the features you would need. Check it out and kiss Creative Labs goodbye forever."
1,"good sound, but poorly made and pathetic customer support","1) Poor construction: loose headphone jack due to poor soldering, resulting in warbly sound2) #1 is/was a widespread problem; Creative knows that, and they still sell it without fixing the problem3) Poor customer service and proven poor track record in being accountable for fixing issues4) An extended warranty is a must"
2,Zen Micro Is Good When It Works,"I bought a Zen Micro 5GB MP3 Player for my daughter as a 2004 Christmas present. I bought it because of the features and capacity it offered, and it had a good keypad design. Initially the player worked fine and we were happy with the purchase, but by the summer of 2005 the left channel cut out so that music only came through the right channel. I sent it back to Creative Labs and they sent me a new one in September. Four months later the hard drive failed in the replacement unit, and now that it has been more than a year since the first unit was purchased, Creative Labs will not replace it unless I pay them $122 (a new one costs $180). Rather than do that, I spent $135 for a Cowon iAudio G3 since it uses a Flash Drive and has no moving parts. Hopefully the Cowon will be more dependable."
2,Nice but needs to back to product development,"I bought this player a litle over a month ago... sounds good , nice features but it is realy unfortunate how badly it works... download and sync problems( Napster). Whatever you do don't drop it even a soft landing can damage the unit.... Battery life is highly oversold ( 12 hours! not in my experience- try maybe 6) .When I return this unit it will be the sencond and last time."
2,Good but Broken,"I had the Creative Zen Micro for all of two months and it died on me claiming it had a mysterious 'firmare problem' illness! I'm not going to give up on it however because while I had it, it was fantastic. So I'm in the process of trying to figure out Amazon warranties. So if anyone knows and can help that would be great! So I recommend it, but make sure you keep recepits because it isn't 100% reliable."
2,disappointed,"I just received my player from amazon on 12/24. I was looking forward to loading the music and starting to enjoy it. I spent 3 hours the first day. I started the 2nd day with problems-it kept locking up while trying to rip the cd to device. I called support 1st time-recording giving hours operation and then cut off. Called back zeroed out to operator who got me help. I then spent an hour with support and had to download a firmware upgrade. Device still locks up and I am forced to take the battery out while holding the ""On"" button to clear memory and reboot. Another lost hour trying to get the device to be recognized by the program. I cannot believe that they sent it out without the latest software upgrade and that its this difficult to get it to work properly. I should have gone with the IPOD. Shame because it comes with the FM built in and great sound. I want my money back and I wish I could get my time back."
1,Don't waste your money!!!,"I've had my player for a year and have had nothing but problems. Within months the player kept crashing. Now that it's over a year old, the headphone jack has gone bad rendering the player useless. The only thing worse than this palayer is the support from Creative trying to fix all the problems."
3,Good Features - Scrolling Impossible,"I liked the features this player offers except for two: 1> The scroll wheel doubles as the select button. I couldn't get it to work properly; I would try to scroll to the next entry and it would act like I ""clicked"" it. I tried reducing sensitivity of the scroll bar, but it wouldn't go low enough. 2> It gets its power through the USB port (long time to charge up). Creative wants $30 for a charger. I travel and may not be near a computer, so figure this cost into the total. After a couple of days I returned it. Still searching for a good mp3 player."
3,Not For Those With a Low Frustration Level,The sound quality is excellent. The size and capacity is also satisfactory for domestic flights and many international trips.. Unfortunately the sensitivity of the touch pads is VERY frustrating. I find it extremely difficult to navigate the available options without engaging the wrong function.
1,Big Disappointment,"I did a lot of research before I bought this. Unfortunately, all of the glitches that people had been experiencing happened to me also. The device kept freezing up, could not get it to sync with its own software, then, in the middle of installing the firmware update (that everyone recommends you do, including Creative), the player crashed and I could not get it to reboot. Used the support web site to troubleshoot, but nothing recommended there would help. I am not a ""techie"", but I am pretty savvy about computers and software and own 2 other mp3 players (Rio, Lyra) that I have never had any problems with. Never even got to hear any music coming out of it......."
1,Lasted 12 days!,"When i got the zen micro 12 days ago, i thought it was the greatest thing. I bought the red one from future shop. it even came with the charger which is a $50 option. It was working perfectly. I babied mine. Always kept it inside the plastic case that comes along with it. I put the unit on charge, a few hours later i come back and the unit is frozen. I know it was not the firmware because I had updated it as soon as i got it home. The unit tells me its a hardrive Problem. I would say avoid this unit at all costs."
1,headphone jack breaks after 3 months,Although great sound quality up until that point. This is a fragile item and not made for daily wear and tear most of us put on an our players. Cost of repair is half cost of new one. Ridiculous. Will switch to Ipod like everyone else.
1,worst mp3 player ever designed,"I tried to use this with napster to go and it didnt work. I had to return it after pulling my hair out and trying every fix.Buyer beware. Also, make sure you double check your player at the store as mine was literally falling apart at the seems.The battery life was also shameful. Even though napster to go doesnt work with iPod, I would still recommend an iPod over the zen micro for napster-- folks, thats how bad this thing is"
5,Great Little Player,"I have had the Zen Micro for about 3 weeks ago, and have been using it constantly. It is a great player with wonderful sound quality. The menus are logical and easy to navigate. I chose this player over an Ipod Mini, because:* FM radio* 1 Gig more space* Much longer battery life* Plays MP3s and WMAs in native format* Records from FM* Can record with built-in microphone* Doesn't need to go to factory to replace battery* Seamless interface with Windows and Windows Media Player* Better sound* Better looks"
2,It's a great player.....for a few months.,"I received this MP3 player as a gift last July, and I didn't start using it until last winter. However, within the past few months a significant problem has occured with the headphone jack and the sound quality is terrible now. Apparently this is a widespread problem with this player, and all you have to do is Google ""headphone jack Creative Zen Micro"" and find the Creative discussion board to read hundreds of complaints about this one problem. To make matters worse, their customer service is practically non-responsive. Do the smart thing and purchase a different MP3 player."
4,Creative Zen Micro,"I recently bought a pink zen micro and at first was very pleased with what i got. The software was easy to use and the sound quality was great.The only problem was the battery. It would last me 4 hours at the most until it went flat. I looked on the internet to find another battery so that i had 2 and so i could listen to my micro for longer. When it arrived i tried it out and it worked but when i came to putting the old one back in the zen kept freezing. It worked eventually but has froze on me a few times. All in All the zen micro is fantastic and i would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a small, modern, great sound, nice looking mp3 player."
1,DON'T BUY ANYTHING FROM CREATIVE!!!,We bought three Creative players. My husband and I have the Zen micro and my daughter the Zen 20GB. All three of ours just froze up and stopped working with one year. I didn't even use mine but maybe two hours per week. Good thing my daughter's was within her one year period by a couple of days. She still had to pay $25.00 Now my husband and I have to just junk ours and buy something else. Customer service is awful!! They won't talk to you unless you show your receipt at least three times. What a piece of garbage!!!
1,Terrific Experience,"I bought this 2 months back. After one month it started giving trouble with the earphone jack. I sent it back to them. They told it is some kind of cosmetic defect (don't know what hell that is). They replaced it. Again the new one has started giving trouble(before 1 month this time). This time the touch pad is not working. Again they have asked me to send it back to them. Anyone who has plans to buy it, be prepared for this running cost(you need to send it back to Creative Labs once every month spending you own money, $6.50 in my case)."
1,Until...,"Until this thing I waisted 250 bucks on is compatible with Audible downloads, it is useless! If your an audible subscriber DON'T bother. Any firmware update to fix this in the future and make this a GREAT player is unknown, contacting Creative or Audible only gets you one line responses that they have NO plans to make it Audible ready. Sorry to be so harsh but reading the threads on Creative's site you get the same thing. The most unbelievable thing is that at one point they actually advertised this player (not on Amazon) with a discount if you sigined up for an Audible subscription!!!"
1,it should be a felony to sell this product,"I bought this product and within 2 weeks it started the crash and freeze on me. To restart i would have to take out the battery and they put it back in. Then it would not accept any music from my computer. So I call creative, wait a month to finallly talk to someone from America, and the answer they gave me was to download some program on Dell's website! So, I asked where to go on dell's website and they didn't know or the name of the download. I highly recommend buying an ipod instead. to be frank i would of been better off with a cassette player."
3,not as good as expected,"i bought zen micro last week. My overall satisfaction is ""so-so"". I wanted an mp3 player with radio capabilities, thus i stayed away from ipod. Replaceable battery was another advantage over the ipod.The truth is that i read reviews which indicated that radio reception can be weak. I work in NYC, so with the radio antennas everywhere i figured that it should not be a problem. Well... it is. I can not get clear radio reception anywhere for any station.Also, battery does not last 12 hours - 4 maybe 5 hours the max ( kbps 128, kh 44 mp3s). No accessories are available either (such as arm band holsters, etc)"
1,Great sound - poor reliability,"I purchased two Zen Micros for Christmas for my chilren. The sound quality and features are excelent. Unfortunately the reliability leaves something to be desired. My daughters started turning itself on when not in use and had to be returned for waranty service, when it was two months old. My son's lasted about three months before it would no longer boot.Portable CD players aren't as convenient, but they're a lot more reliable."
2,pissed off,"after 2 weeks, it stopped working on me. I'm happy I bought it on Amazon and was able to return it with no problems. But I'm pissed, I should have went with an Ipod."
1,"Bad software, can't even install!","With my 5 GB Creative Zen Micro, inserting the disc and going into setup, it would not even go on and gives me an ""encountered a problem and needs to close error"", and I am extremely disappointed! If there's a solution to this, please help!"
2,Creative Zen Micro - Way to confusing/touchy key pad,"I ordered my Zen Micro and was excited when it came by FedEx. I opened up the box and was sure I would be listening to music soon. Unfortunately, you get about 3 pages of instructions, none of which tell you how to transfer music, very annoying, my music would transfer into the PC library on the software, but I couldn't get it to transfer to the Micro, support center closed at 6pm, and you only get 1 free call, so I was SOL. Also, the touch pad on this thing is waaaay to sensitive even at a low setting, it was ridiculous, I wanted to throw this thing out of the window. I sent it back for a refund and ordered an iPod, which all of my friends said I should have done in the first place, the few dollars you save on this is NOT worth it!!"
2,Not as good as the ipod mini,"I purchased this over the Ipod Mini because it had several nice features: extra 1G storage, WMA support, replaceable battery, and especially that it wasn't an Apple product with their proprietary architecture.After using it for a week, I wish I had purchased the Ipod. The Touchpad is virtually unusable -- sometimes you have to press like mad to make a selection and other times the slightest brush causes something to be selected that you don't want. This is by far my biggest complaint.Another problem is that the latest 2.0 firmware upgrade moves you into Windows Media Player 10 which seems to be very, very slow for downloads.Also note that it doesn't seem to charge when connected to the PC, only when plugged into an AC socket even though they both connect to the single USB port on the player, so you have to charge the battery separately from downloading music."
4,Nice Product,"I enjoy my Zen Micro. Lots of great features including an FM tuner, 5 GB storage (for files and music), and a cool display. The interface is powerful and robust and you can easily find the song(s) you want.My complaint is two fold 1) the battery life is short and erratic. Ocassionally I won't even use the player, yet the battery will be dead. Weird. 2) The software from creative to interface with the player crashes regularly. I would say 1 out of 4 times I end up sending a ""Windows Error Report"" because the Creative software dies.All in all I am happy with my purchase. If you are looking for a feature rich and easy to use player you should look no further. However, as aforementioned, it does have it's quirks! If I could do it again I would buy the 6GB player with a black face. Best of luck shopping!"
4,Way better than the iPod,"I got the Creative Zen Micro about 3 months ago in pink and love it. I used to have an iPod and hated it. This is much better. The FM radio is an added bonus. And its tiny and the blacklight is amazing. I currently have 1,152 songs on it. I would suggest downloading Napster To-Go for new songs, its less than $15 a month for unlimited downloads (much better than $1 for a song at itunes), and once you download the song it automatically transfers to the mp3 player. I esp love the fact you can make a playlist as you go so you dont have to keep chaning to the song you want.The only things i dont love are: the earbuds (quite uncomfortable, i bought a new pair), dies a bit quickly, it takes forever to scroll (sometimes i get it to go if i hold it, other times i have to keep scrolling), and maybe its just mine with alot of songs, but it takes awhile when you click to go to the next song, go back, or for the song to start playing.Overall i love this product and highly recommend it!"
2,so disappointing!,i bought my Zen to help deal with the stress of 3 months of international trips i had to take for business. the first leg of my flight which stopped in DC from seattle and my battery was dead. i charged it up at the airport and it died before i got to london. then it locked up. i pulled the battery out and left it overnight. it worked the next day for 30 minutes before it locked up again. now it doesn't work at all. AND my pc doesn't recognize the device. i'm too busy to deal with stupid and poorly created products. i may try to have it fixed one time then bag the whole deal. will never buy creative again.
2,my locked up on me,i just got one for christmas and i downloaded all the software. it was working fine for a couple hours and then all of a sudden it froze on me. i took the battery out to restart it and now the thing will not even turn on. has any one had this problem and if so could you help me.
4,zen micro rocks!!,"i got a zen micro 4 my birthday last nov. i was sooo happy. then all of a sudden it didnt work, so we returned it and got a new 1.i love my zen micro. even though it has 5 gigs, its a good first mp3 player and you'll never need a memory upgrade if your are only storing music. not that you can get a memory upgrade 4 a micro. about a couple of weeks ago the head phone jack started 2 get touchy, but it doesnt bother me because it's always in my hand. one more thing: if the battery is almost dead, the player controls are very touchy. i hope you found this helpful"
3,"Good sound, a few bugs","I really like the sound this player provides, but it has a few glitches that drive me crazy. First, if you haven't turned it on for awhile or you have just charged it, it takes somewhere close to five minutes to turn on. The first time I used it, I was able to select a list of songs to listen to instead of randomly listening to all my songs or a pre loaded playlist (just as a temporary playlist). I have not been able to do so since then. When I have tried to set a list, the slightest mis-step on the dial, even with the sensitivity turned low, will wipe out everything I have just done. The software is easy to use once you figure it out, but it took me awhile to do so as there are no directions that come with the player other then the very basic set-up instructions. I like the radio being part of it, and have been using it more for that than an mp3 player because of the difficulties it has been giving me. Maybe I just have a faulty player, but it isn't what I was hoping for."
3,Good and Bad,"I bought the Creative Zen mp3 player b/c I didn't want to buy an iPod about a year ago. At the beginning, I noticed that the radio part didn't work too great. It was also hard to tell when the battery was going to die on you. But fine, I could listen to music fine, the sound was clear. However, it starting to give me problems, like it would turn on by itself, or freeze, or the battery will discharge almost immediately. I don't know if it's just mine that is the problem or if this happens frequently. But my friend has had an iPod for 2 years and works great, I don't think this thing is going to last that long. I'm only giving it 3 stars b/c atleast it still works."
1,What a piece of CRAP!!!,"I purchased two Zen Micros and within two months both had issues with the headphone jacks cutting in and out. Both had to be returned for warranty work and after a lengthy wait they were returned. The replacements are sent without current firmware and driver updates in place which means that you will have to figure out which updates are needed thru the Creative website. There is an Autoupdate feature that allows you to just plug the Zen into the USB cable and the link decides which updates you need. To bad this doesn't work either. Now, after having problems with one player that is 7 months old and the other not charging right I would say save your money and buy a Ipod Nano"
2,"Nice, but doesn't support directories","This device has great sound, but...It doesn't support subdirectories. So all songshave to go into a single flat directory. Forme this is a major inconvenience. I liketo separate jazz, pops, classical, recordedbooks, etc.And, when you connect it to a computer,it doesn't appear as a normal directory, so you can'tuse it for data files.This is the sort of info that you can't determine fromthe product description. You have to buy it to find out."
2,Disappointed - good product but very unreliable,"As many other reviews have agreed, I liked mine until it broke - in two ways. Same headphone problem as others, but that was nothing compared to the total meltdown it then experienced. Now I can't even turn it on, and I've only owned it 11 months. I liked the space, features, setup, etc. but that makes me all the more sad that it's hopelessly broken. Try another brand, because if you buy this one you will just end up buying the other brand in a few months anyway."
2,disappointed,A year later and I wish I had the money for an ipod. I have been having the audiojack issue for a long time and don't even take my player with me anywhere anymore. What's the point of having an mp3 player you can't walk around with? Ridiculous.
1,"*** UPDATE *** No USB, no charging","*** UPDATE ****In the US, ZEN Micro's are now shipped without AC adapters. Previuously shipped units may have them. This is from the Creative Labs customer service department on 5/25/05.I was quite surprised to learn that this unit ships without an AC adapter. The only way to charge it is via the USB port. What if you are travelling without access to a USB port? Creative warns against using a 3rd party adapter but yet has none available for sale at its web site. Does anyone have any experience with a third party adapter?"
4,Some Tips Might Help~~~~~~~,"I bought a zen Micro from Amazon about three weeks ago. I really like the amazing sound quality and everything goes fine execpt the annoying freezing problem. My computer sometimes could not recognize the unit then it froze and even could not be shut down. Fortunately after several times, I finally found out that if the unit is FULL CHARGE then the freezing problem would come up, but if not, everything will be fine. So DO NOT PLUG IN THE FULLY CHARGED UNIT TO YOUR COMPUTER!!!!!Another thing that might help is when u try to connect the unit to the pc, please first plug the usb into the unit, then connect the other end to the pc.Hope these can help some folks' problems."
5,I love it,"I got my Zen Micro last week. I absolutely love it. It's so small. It looks sleek and modern. It holds plenty of songs. The sound is amazing. The menu is easy to use and understand. I love the touchpade controls. They're easy to use.The radio and voice recording are nice. The earbud headphones are really nice. The battery has a long life. It's rechargable and supposedly easy to replace though I haven't had to do it yet of course. The file ripping/transfering software that comes with the player is easy to use. It's faster than WMP. So far I have no complaints with this player. If anyone is thinkning of getting an ipod mini, forget it and go with this player. It's cheaper, holds more songs and is smaller."
2,"Buyer Beware, Decent MP3 Player, with One Major Flaw","The major flaw exist, namely, the headphone jack which fails sooner or later on many Creative Zen Micro. [...]Now it is useless to have all those great feature if you are getting only audio channel or no sound. Some poor souls on the forum are on the 3 or 4th replacement, and has yet find one without the dreaded headphone jack problem. The audio on my unit started fading on the first day, after a week, the left channel (audio) is totally no matter how much I wiggle the headphone connection. It cost me $39 to courier it back to Creative Labs for repair or replacement, as soon as I receive the new unit, I will be sure to sell it off right away. Until Creative Labs fix this problem, I would recommend that you save yourself the future headache and buy an Ipod Mini or Iriver H10 instead."
1,don't buy this,"I ordered this as a Christmas gift in October 2004. It took till December 13th to receive it. When it arrived, it never worked. The computer says the device has malfunctioned. Also, it will not turn off - the screen freezes. It's cute, but what good is it if it doesn't play? also, the return process was cumbersome and took a long time, over 30 minutes on the phone just to return it."
3,Good not great,Biggest problem for me was battery drainage when not in use. Navigation not as intuitive as Ipod. Radio feature nice.I returned it because of batt life. Would consider again if Creative solves this problem.
2,It's going back again,"I don't know, maybe I got a defective one but first, the player would not shut off, next, the player would not come on - I had to send it away to get repaired. Now, the player's ear phone jack is not working - I have to send it away again. When it's working, it's great but it is very tempermental."
2,Problems fixed with firmware upgrade at creative.com. . .,"Player skipped every half hour or so (meaning, like if you were listening to an LP, but it would be like a minor skip) but was fixed with firmware upgrade, downloadable from creative.com. Touch pad is a bit too sensitive, even at the lowest sensitivity setting; a person with digital arthritis couldn't use this device. Battery life also improved with firmware upgrade."
4,Great little unit . . .,"Solid product w/ more features than iPod mini (it's main competitor). No problems w/ it, and it's touchpad is no more difficult than the iPod's.Reasons why 4 stars and not 5:1) software interface (iTunes still superior to anything else out there)2) accessories (new product and not as widespread as iPods, hence very few accessories available)"
1,Buy a mini don t waste your money on this,My father brought this for me for christmas and i loved the look but then when i turned it on the screen turned black and then turned off i recharge the battery but it did not come on again and they would not let me bring it back. Dont waste your money
1,Do NOT buy!!!! This $#*@ing thing doesn't work!!!,"I got this product, followed the sparse directions, first charging for three hours until fully charged, then loading the software, then loading my music.The first thing I noticed was that the belt clip broke INSTANTLY. I mean instantly. I put it on my belt, took it off, and the EXTREMELY cheap plastic was broken.Then, after about 30 minutes of play, the device stopped working entirely. Completely. Nothing. In the middle of playing a song, it simply cut off. The thing wouldn't even shut down any more. Tried taking out the battery and putting it back. It didn't even show the normal start up screen with the droplets of water. Just straight to a screen reading CREATIVE, and is now COMPLETELY unresponsive. I cannot believe I spent my money on this. What a complete and total ripoff. Buyers BEWARE. This is a TOTAL piece of you know what. I am going to get my money back and buy an IPOD."
2,"Good functions, but way too ugly","It's nice that the Zen Micro has bells and whistles like FM (but where's AM???) and voice recording, and 20% more storage than ""the other"" mini MP3 player, but why is it so (...)ugly? The colors are a joke, and I personally hate the stupid vertical touchpad. But my biggest gripe is still the extremely ugly design. What's the point of having ""good audio"" in your hand when your g/f thinks you have no taste whatsoever and your friends laugh their heads off while proudly showing off their iPod Mini? Creative should hire some real industrial designers."
2,"Great player, but design is flawed","I loved this player for the first 2 weeks I owned it. It died on me. Apparently, based on research on the web, Creative is having some issues with this players internal hard drive going bad. Go to [...]and search through their discussion forums in the support area. Look for articles on battery life and player hangs. You'll find quite a few. I had to return mine.**update** I received a new one. Its been working for about 1 month now without a problem."
2,Lots of problems,"Had a great first three weeks with this product and then out of nowhere...it failed. And failed. And failed. And then failed some more. Every time I tried to restore the firmware something else would go wrong. Waiting for Creative to ship a new one. If that one doesn't work, I'll try another brand or wait for something better. Beware of the new Napster. I talked to a service rep from Creative and he said there had been quite a few problems with Napster to Go, because it was rushed to the market. If you don't update your songs daily or at least plug into Napster with your Zen then you risk your songs being erased because of the firmware that is installed. Be very wary of this product."
5,I love it,"Well, I have an Ipod mini - and I really like it, but all in all, I like the Zen Micro more. Why? Smaller size, 1 gb of more space, radio, voice recording, removable battery, cooler look, all in one. The touchpad is annoying sometimes (give me the click-wheel and pressable buttons any day), but not at all as difficult to get over as other people are saying.I love how small the thing is, and the blue glow - I've had it for two weeks with no electronic problems at all. Creative Media Source is very easy to use once you get the hang of it, and the file transfers are fast. Sound quality is great, fm tuner is fine, as is the recorder. This is the mp3 player with everything I need. As long as it lasts me a good three years, I'm satisfied."
2,Read the Warranty When Buying.,Creative came out with a good Item but with a bad warranty which says that it doesn't believe in their product enough to warranty it for a full year.After 6 months of normal use my Zen didn't work. I contacted Creative and they said that I was out of the warranty period which is 90 days for this product. They said that they will repair it for an additional cost of $25.00 + Shipping.so Again READ THE WARRANTY WHEN BUYING.For the price I paid I could have gotten an IPOD.
1,zen micro,i first bought the zen micro about a week ago. When i first got it i was very excited. It took me a while to figure out the software because of the basic owners manual. Just as i started to listen to my music the headphone jack screwed up and all my music was muffled. I couldn't even hear the singing. This was within the first 2 days i got this product
1,Great when it works,"Disgusted with apple's terrible customer service, I vowed never to buy anything apple again and jumped at the micro. For a while it worked very well. Yes, it would often start ""rebuilding the library"" for no good reason. And it often seemed twitchy - but I was willing to overlook these flaws. In fact, I bought one for my girlfriend's birthday. BUT, that one had to be returned to creative after less than 2 weeks, when it just froze. It was still within the 90 day window when creative will fix it no questions asked - which was great. Fastforward a few months and now mine is broken too!! What gives?? Obviously mine is well past the 90 day window and even though its still within the 1 year warranty period, Creative wants money to fix it.Thats rich.Save yourself the headache. The quality control on this thing is terrible. When it works it works well. But more often than not its acting up."
1,head phone jack problem,"after a couple months of use, the head phone jack broke and I could hardly hear any sound, i sent it in for repair. i was happy again, but just for 2 months because the darn thing broke again, but my warrenty was alredy over. I need a new mp3 player. Not sure if this is a common problem or just with creative products. I didn't want apple ipod players, but I think I might switch to the other side. UPDATE: I found a website explaining how you can fix it by using a soldering iron. I have never used a soldering iron before, but i went out and bought one and fixed it. If I was able to fix mine, I'm pretty sure you can fix yours too. I'm a girl.Update September 4, 2006: After fixing it with the soldering iron, the problem came back about a month later. i probably didn't fix it that well and the headphone jack thing became loose. Heck, I don't know. I don't care. I need a new mp3 player for my bus ride to school. For sure it's not going to be a creative product."
1,Terrible product. Not tested thoroughly enough,"Within about 2 months of purchasing this product, whenever I tried to turn it on, the machine would freeze up. I contacted customer support and they suggested that I clean up the drive and then reboot. That worked for 1 day, and then it reverted back to having the same old problem. The unit was under 1 year old, however after conversing with their poor customer service department, I came to the sad conclusion that although parts are under the warranty, shipping and labor is not. It doesn't take a math genius to realize this device is better off in the circular file cabinet, which is where subsequently I tossed mine."
1,Missing OGG sopport,"I'm writing this review because I'm been loocking forward to the iPod competition... but it is constantly letting me down. Why does creative incorporated FM radio and not ogg sopport first?, being this a digital music player... I think the are just trying to battle the iPod with the same features, not really trying to make a better player. There are far too few ogg players out there, and most of them are not good or too expensive..."
1,Don't buy it!!!!!!!!,"I have never written an online review before but I feel compelled to do so. While it appears some people have had good luck with this product, I found it a complete piece of trash. My friends laughed when I said, ""It was great until it stopped working."" I didn't mind the touchy controls and really loved the size and shape of the player. Others on this site have described the many technical problems with the Zen Micro. I will simply say I traded in my first one when it died only to have my second one become very sick in less than one month. I now have an ipod nano with only 1/2 the storage capacity of my last zen micro but having 500 songs that play beats having 1000 songs that don't."
2,"Good, when it works","Bought this player a few months ago, and it's crashed on me several times. Now it's locked up, apparently for good. When it worked, I really liked the sound quality when I used some better earphones than what it came with. The random play is a good function, but they all have that now. The touch screen concept is cool, but sometimes a bit hard if there's a specific song you want while driving or jogging. I've purchased several creative products in the past, including the Nomad II series, which eventually broke. Creative apparently does not have good quality control, although they are pretty innovative with the designs. Got a few months of good use out of this thing and the earlier crashes were fixed using the Creative website so I will give it two stars. I also highly recommend the napster service, unlimited downloads for $15 a month, which is great for these 5gb players. Time to buy a Rio..."
4,Great MP3 Player,"I am not super technical, but I know enough that this is a great player. The face controls can be touchy, but the lock feature makes up for that. The sound is pure with a broad range. The headphones are pretty basic so I bought a better pair, but otherwise I have really enjoyed the Zen.One problem is the charger unit. It comes apart (I suspect for changing the prong unit for international use) and if one is not careful you can find yourself without a way to charge the unit back up again.Otherwise I would HIGHLY recommend this unit."
2,Painful to use the touch pad,"Just got this out of the box. The touchpad is a big pain to use. Too sensitive to the touch--could not adjust the sensitivity though I followed the instructions in the manual, and you can hardly use any other menus except the ones highlighted by default. I decided to give up on it, after trying almost an hour of useless firmware update to 1.1. Tech support article said there is a version 2.1, but when I clicked on it, the file could not be found. Did they decide to delete the link to that file, after finding some problems? Very bad firmware, touch pad feature. I am surprised such a large company could make/sell such an indecent piece of expensive product."
5,the best yet,"I recently recived this product from my dad because he didn't have much room on it for him. I haven't had any problems with it. I started out with a small sandisc 512mb mp3 but the screen went out so I got this one. I like the part that it has a removable battery (unlikeinthe ipod's you hav to send it into apple to replace the battery which could take weeks,and it cost $80.00 to replace a battery in an ipod while in this creative it only costs $30). Ipods also dont have the fm radio (unless you drop another $50.00 into it). And the creative has easyer controls and seems to work better. The music player also comes in verriety of colors, and the neon light adds personality to it. So if going to by an ipod ipod mini any other ipod save your money and spend it on the creatve zen micro."
5,Seriously the best.,"When I started looking for an mp3 player I didn't just follow the trend and get an ipod because it was the cool thing to do. I did my research. I refrenced price and facts. And when it all came down to it.The Creative Zen Micro was better. I've had my Micro for about 8 months now. I've dropped it countless times. And It still works as good as it did the day I got it in the mail.On here you'll see a lot of people bitching about the scrolling. But I have to say, it's ridiculously easy to use. My little cousin *who's 6* can use it just as well as I can.The software that comes with the micro is also ridiculously simple. It's as easy as copy and paste to get songs into your device.There seriously is no downside to getting the Micro, because on top of everything it's cheeper then it is to get an IPOD of the same size. Not to mention the batteries last longer and cost less to replace."
4,Love my Zen.,"This product is amazing and better than the Ipod you can get at the same price. the 4G Ipod costs the same as this 5G Zen Micro. It also has a voice recorder and FM radio that you can only get on an Ipod if you but an adapter seperately. Creative did an awesome job with the design. The headphones have great sound and durability and mine came with some extras when I bought it (a stand, a belt hook, charger) that I know doesn't come with every one. I have the black one and adore it. It looks nice and sleek and the blue background light looks awesome against the black. The touch buttons do take a little getting used to and I don't like how the scroll button is the same button used as an ""enter"" key, but you get used to it and it isn't a big deal. I take mine everywhere."
2,Great MP3 Player... when it works,"I got this thing and I loved it. However, its built very poor. Yeah, its got alot more features than the iPod and it costs way less, but the thing falls apart.I went to Creative's website and it turns out that ALOT of users are having problems. The display ceases to function, the player freezes... and this is from 100% standard/official usage of the player.Great features but its built at a trash can quality levels. I was shocked actually. Creative/E-Mu have never let me down. I've been buying their soundcards since like 1997 and have never had a problem with them. They need to implement the same standards of quality control across their entire product line."
2,Not what you want if there is a problem,"Zen Micro is a neat player with nice features. Problem is if you do have a problem you are sunk. E-mail support has a single canned response to wipe your disk, load new firmware and try again. I got the same response for my Zen when it was freezing up (solved the problem), when the battery would not charge, for a bad USB cable, for error message on player with licensing error (for properly licensed music). Support is terrible and the player is failure prone."
4,"A Good ""Poor Man's iPod""","It actually has a lot more than an iPod Mini, and for less cost. FM Radio, Voice Recorder, Datebook, it's definitely a nice little item. The software is really nice, it's easy to use.I do have a few complaints. The biggest problem being a high-pitched whine if I ever skip to another song. It's not really loud, though. The earbuds aren't that great, besides looking like iPod rip-off buds, they begin to lose sound quality pretty quickly.Overall, I'd suggest to anyone to buy it. iPods are just way to commercial, and therefore way too expensive for what you get."
2,Trying to be a loyal fan,"I am trying to be a loyal fan of the Zen Micro but it is getting increasingly difficult. I am having the same problem with the head phone jack. I sent my original purchase back because it was within its warranty but then the replacement product began having the same problem. I don't know, I may have to go over to iPod just to get a working product. I was really in love with the Zen Micro (when it worked) because the features were awesome. I don't think I will buy another Creative product because a functioning product is not too much to ask.Just recently I purchased the Zen Micro Photo. Itis a great looking product. After reading more than a few reviews, I am certain the ear jack problem will not be an issue with this one. Wish me luck."
5,Creative Zen Micro,"I got this mp3 player today for Christmas which i was looking really foward too. I opened the box and went right away to set it up. Make sure that when you get this that you charge it with the included charger from Staples. I currently have 61 songs on it and so far it has been as expected. The sound is great and the headphones aren't as bad as i thought. The features are also great, however i haven't tried the fm radio but i heard the reception isn't that good. So far the headphone jack is working just make sure that you don't take it in and out, then it will begin to make it's way away from the player. The player itself seems really sturdy. It is curved to fit your hand. The sensitivity was first on medium for me and when i got it i changed it to low, which i highly reccommend.Overall, so far, this player is amazing and everything works great."
2,earphones cut in and out...,"for 250 bucks I hoped it would last a couple years. It lasted about 5 months,..then the earphone jack cuts in and out. It's useless."
4,Better than an IPOD!,"Smaller and louder than an IPOD! Nice touch feel and a lot cheaper! This is the one Creative has been trying to make to beat an IPOD and in my opinion they have! The ability to change your own battery was one of the key points for me, FM radio {not a feature I'll ever use}, Voice recording, sync to Outlook, all nice touches. The ability to drag-n-drop from Windows {which other Creative players had lacked}, I really like using MusicMatch Plus and it works great with it, I was unsure because I could not find any information anywhere before buying if it would work with this particular player and it does very nicely, and without a Plug-In. I highly recommend this MP3 player to anybody! Great job Creative, finally some competition for Apple!"
4,Better than the alternatives,"After reviewing and trying out the 5GB Rio and the 20 GB Archos this one looks and works the best.PROvery quiet, does not lock down, ultra fast customer service by email (I had a problem and they solved it with a firmware upgrade within 5 hours) world radio, Alarm function, really cute and really smallCONSYou have to install software on your computer, the software is not very good and you can't just plug it into any computer.You have to get used to the touchpad (it has 3 different sensibility stages)"
2,zen micro,As with all creative products its fragility diminishes the overall quality. This allied with fairly rank customer service has led me to look elsehwere. I've been loyal to the tune of 4 units from Nomad 2 upwards but I've finally had enough. Trying to get this unit repaired equates with the ease of a self-performed lung transplant.
1,Frozen,"Had two Zen Micro touch in the matter of 1 week. Both crapped out after 2 days of use. I really thought this was going to be a great MP3 player. And it was when it worked. FM radio was nice and the sound was great. But if it freezes up, what good are these. Hoping the next round of Zens from Creative Lab will be bug free."
1,Warning,"This item has caused me too much frustration. It's a piece of crap backed by a terrible warranty. I've had it for only three months and it's already broken and useless and the company refuses to take responcibility because I told them that I dropped it once. Once. In an effort to fix the problem I told them the truth and it obviously backfired. Stick with the Ipod, at least it has a decent company backing it..."
1,I am returning it back,"First the touch pad is too sneitive. I would rather have the buttons.Second the FM receiver is not sensitive enough to catch the regualr channels.Third, It would not charge from the USB port out of box, one has to install the Drivers/Media Source application to get it to charge which looks outright foolish specially when the system does not have required drivers on it or you have to sacrifice min 128 MB as HDD space for it to be able to charge. what a piece of BS.I am done with it. I have had enough with this player's nightmares."
3,Better than nothing.,"The Star Sister are fabulous, but the CD is not. The site lists tracks like “Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy”, “In the Mood”, etc. What it doesn’t say is that the tracks are just a few seconds long – part of a medley. In this regard, I was really, really disappointed. I would pay the money right now to have the full length songs as they would be solid gold, plated with platinum. I’m going to keep the CD only because these tracks are better than no tracks at all. Does anybody know if there is a place to find these songs in their entirety?"
5,Great CD,Tracklisting:1 You're The One For Me [Remix] (5:53)2 You're The One For Me [Dimitri Remix] (7:47)3 You're The One For Me [Bassic Remix] (6:56)4 You're The One For Me [Radio Edit] (4:12)
2,Not that interesting,A very dull book. Very hard to follow. None of my questions were answered. Not enough information on any subject.
5,A must for AYBS Fans(and Fanatics like me),"Are You Being Served is a Favorite of mine, and when I saw that this book was available, I had to have it. It's a must for AYBS fans. The book has chapters for each of these:1.The cast of characters (with info about the actor, as well as the character they are playing), 2.Behind the scenes, 3.Synopses of each of the 69 episodes with ratings for each from * to *****,( This is a great feature) 4.Spinoffs, 5.Trivia Quiz (100 questions)and answers, 6.Glossary. There are pictures throughout the book, and there are little tidbits on the side margins too..It's all there. This book in a word is fantastic. So glad I ordered. Great,great price, fast shipping, book was as described. Would definitely recommend for the regular AYBS fan, or for the fanatics like me.I just got it today, and I've already went through it, as I'm sure I will again and again.Thnks for having this book."
5,Fun and Entertaining,As a fan of the show I found this book entertaining and enjoyable to read. It gives some details about each episode and the actors. I couldn't ask for anything more.
2,not very good.,"Hmm! Looks like whoever was writing the code for this page forgot to add the tag to end the italics after ""IP""! I'd do it here, but I know HTML doesn't show up in these reviews, so I guess I'll have to resign myself to it. Anyway, this really isn't a very good book. I mean, it has some good information, but it is kinda smug. I also really, really hate the intelligence-insulting ""translations"" of British phrases. Hello! Even if, unlike me, you're not a devoted anglophile, these should not give you to much trouble. Gah...One specific thing that bothered me was John Inman's disingenuous claims that his character wasn't meant to be gay. I mean really. Even if there weren't numerous blindingly obvious admonitions to such in many, many episodes, that woudl just be completely untrue. Come on, people. What is this, retrospective homophobia? Get real. Um...that's all."
3,Nice supplement to a wonderful television series,"We Americans have only been discovering Are You Being Served? in the U.S. for about the past ten or so years, but this series has long since been off the air in Britain. Considered by most modern Brits to be dated and terribly broad, AYBS? is not on the top of their favorites list. However, it is on mine.This book, which was produced only after America started its love affair with the series, is a great supplement for those who can't get enough of Grace Bros.' staff.You get introduction to each of the characters and the actors who portrayed them. You are privy to information that you may often have wondered about. You also can try your hand at some trivia. The best for me was the Episode Guide. I have a few personal favorites, but the pinnacle is when Mrs. Slocumb is all trussed up in a gold lame dress for a commercial shoot and the remote microphone gets lost in her cleavage. Hilarious!"
4,Great behind-the-scenes synopsis of the Best British Comedy!,"This book contains interviews with all the cast with a guide to all 69 episodes of the series, including: Why Trevor Bannister left the show, How John Inman got that walk! and Why Mollie Sugden turned to colored wigs.This book is ""All that with a bag of chips"" especially the inside scoops that you find along the margins!Happy reading!"
5,Overpriced beauty,"For those who feel comfortable with the German language, this is a very nice and very clear book on the anatomy of the most important Middle European Woods, with very clear black&white microphotographs. Now reprinted (2003), paperback."
3,"Disapointing, Sir John's voice is wet and overly dramatic.","As a child, I spent many hours listening to my records, one of which was, The Happy Prince, narrated by, Frederick March, whose voice and tone never failed to mesmorize my sisters and me. This version lacks honesty of emotion and I found Sir John's voice difficult to listen to. He sounds overly dramatic and his voice sounds,""WET"". I never unwrapped the second CD."
4,"42"" Blades .... They Fit","For $17. you get a set of new blades that fit and are straight .... that's good.The Husqvarna dealer will order you the same blades for 4x that price.The blades even say ""This Side Down to Grass"".All you need is a 1/2 inch wrench."
5,"Worth the price just for the ""Hammerklavier""","This is beautiful music making and a fine testament to Solomon's playing. Some have found the sound quality to be problematic, but I have to say that after a few seconds it is hard not to simply get caught up in the poetry and forget about sound quality. I do not have other versions of these recordings so I cannot say whether this is the best release to purchase, but I understand the EMI issues (on Amazon: ASIN B000002S4V) are less friendly on the ear. Whatever the case, I would not be without this recording of the ""Hammerklavier"" which some who are better qualified to judge have rated as well-nigh definitive. Enjoy!"
4,Very cool but i dont think i can review it yet!,"i havent actually listened to every single song on this album but from what i have heard, j,lc is fantastic. I love ""Not Today"" with the most beautiful na-nas I have heard in a while. Cathedrals is sad and perfect, Body parts is good and b-13 is also good.great cd, you should buy! (like i will ;) )"
3,Good...other than the hit song,"Some of the upbeat numbers here are fun, but I have a biiig problem with the ballad song that became the radio hit, ""Cathedrals."" Put simply, the singer sounds like he is agonized and overwrought the entire time he is singing it, for no apparent reason. There is not a scrap of lyric here that requires this kind of affectation, and an otherwise pretty song suffers mightily for it."
5,melody rhythm funk depth lyricism individuality,"I've been a fan of JLC for several years since I first caught one of their shows at the Horse and Cart Cafe in Charleston, SC. While this album only scratches the surface of their talents, within the bounds of a major label release this is the exceeds my hopeful expectations. From the resonant ""B-13"" to the peppy, self-effacing ""my guitar"" to the unnervingly timely ""come out clean"" the cuts on this album maintain the eclectic styles that have made JLC a favorite of fans of intelligent, fun, regional music. I hope people will hunt down previous JLC releases (""licorace tea demos"" and ""buzz"") to catch tracks like ""easter parade"", ""opium"", and ""heart on the ocean"". But ""whatever you do, whatever you do"" SEE THESE GUYS LIVE. This is happy music."
3,worth buying but...,"...if you're not a fan and are a newcomer to Jump's music I recommend starting with their 3rd album, Vertigo, or even their latest, Between the Dim and the Dark. As for this album, its clear appeal to teenage audiences and the fact that it has a lively catchiness sometimes borders on annoying in songs like ""My Guitar,"" reminding me of a preconceived version of Ben Folds's Rockin' the Suburbs. (Folds's album came after this one.) However, the good songs on this album are really good and the live performances of this band, though a bit short, are stellar and make them worth supporting. Though ""Cathedrals"" is a favorite of many (and apparently of Elton John's, according to multi-instrumentalist, Matt Bivins, himself) and is very beautiful, I prefer Bivins's style of quasi-fluid, quasi-run-on sentence utterances in ""Body Parts"" and ""Habit."" The last two songs are also beautiful. Clifford's voice is gentle, soothing, and delicate."
3,Magazine is so-so...,"I was told I HAD to buy a JLC CD. I would love Magazine, I was told. However, even though I've tried for months to get into the CD, I really haven't been able to. A few songs, like the funky ""Habit"", the sweet ""Close Your Eyes"" and ""Cathedrals"" are nice to listen to and quite enjoyable. But to get to those, you have to endure such songs as ""My Guitar"" (cheesy--and not in that good way) and ""Body Parts"" (which seems like an over-the-top, forced song in the vein of Habit--but overkill, unlike ""Habit""). JLC is NOT by any means a bad band though. Their most recent CD is more mature and I enjoy it a lot more. Notice I've said the word ""enjoy"" a lot. JLC is enjoyable; they're not altogether unique and brand-new, however. This isn't said to take away from their skill and value, though; they have an almost classic feel to them. In short, Magazine is mediocre, the other CDs of theirs are much better, and JLC itself, as a band, is worthy of your attention."
5,"Jump, Little Children comes out clean","This eclectic album truly shows the versitility of Jump, Little Children. Fast songs such as Come Out Clean and My Guitar will have you jumping and having a good time, but they are just as good at slowing things down with their poignant slow songs such as B-13 and Close Your Eyes. The cd jumps from one extreme to the next and lands perfectly every time.Fans may be interested in J,LC's follow-up album ""Vertigo"" as well as the band Rosebud which features some of the members of J,LC. Check out their website...for more information!"
5,The Best non-Top 40 CD out there,"this CD is great. how can anyone sum up better words, feelings, or thoughts about such a CD. ""Cathedrals"" has deeply touched my life. Matt and Jays' voices will amaze you and bring you back for more."
5,Permanently on my playlist!! Love JLC!,Love Jump Little Children. I bought the MP3 album for Cathedrals. I heard it on TV and made a mad rush to google JLC and find out all the info about them.Favorite song? Cathedrals. This song moves me. I can listen to this forever.Actually this whole album is a must. It's an emotion-packed filled nirvana. You won't regret it.
5,Great CD!,"I bought this CD after hearing ""Cathedrals"" on the radio. The entire album is VERY good with a great variey of tunes. This has quickly become one of my favorite CD's, you won't regret buying the album."
2,Lack of durability was disappointing,"Several years ago, I bought my husband a pair of Youngstown's General Utility Plus gloves, which he used and abused doing everything from yardwork to HVAC to car repairs to construction. He loved those gloves, but they were getting ratty. I got him the Pro XT, thinking from the description and price that these were an upgrade. They literally fell apart within a month, and he's back in his same old Youngstowns."
4,Nice Work Gloves,"Like these gloves perfect for my job. I liked the old design better, but I guess everything changes. They do make your hands sweat, but that is better than ruined hands. I would recommend these to anyone that has to handle lumber, metal, or any rough materials."
4,Nice tough gloves,"I use these when I work with sandstone. They have held up pretty well. Normally I will destroy a pair of glove in a week or two. But these have held up well for going on two months. The cloth thumb is nice for wiping the sweat off your brow, they vent well, and they fit great. I'll will be buying these again when I finally wear through this pair."
1,Disappointing book on Zen,Dreary style makes for bad reading. There are other better titles on the same subject(s). I can't help thinking Powell comes across as pompous sometimes.
5,Perfect For Sensitive Skin,"I will start out by saying that I'm very picky and I have to be. I seem to be that rare person who can't touch my finger to my face, without breaking out. The oils from my fingers clog my pores. Alot of shave lotions, oils and creams claim to be meant for sensitive skin, but irritate my face. This is the first and only product that I have used that will not clog my pores and will leave my face smooth as a baby's butt without leaving razor burns. Perfect!"
2,"Absolutely brilliant, but credited to the wrong group","This is absolutely brilliant stuff, but... it's not African Fiesta National. It's the original African Fiesta, before it acrimoniously split up into African Fiesta National (with Rochereau) and African Fiesta Sukisa (with Nico and Dechaud). I have the physical CD, which I ordered from Amazon. Amazon has catalogued this CD exactly as the record label, Syllart, put it out, but the label has attributed all of it to the wrong band. And it's not the first time they've done it.As for the music, it's absolutely brilliant. The lead guitarist on all the tracks is Docteur Nico, one of the most influential guitarists in Africa, so the material here is essential to all fans of this genre. But the misattribution just makes me angry, so it's two stars."
5,Timbukerrific,"Very sturdy construction and just the right size for taking around the city. Not so much a bag for carrying large quantities of stuff (get a messenger bag for that) but it's ideal for your everyday urban activities or travelling.It's a bit on the heavy side, but that can be attributed to the high quality of the materials and sturdy construction.Lot's of pockets that are well thought out in their placement and sizing. On a recent trip to the west coast I was able to store my camera, ipod, cellphone, a bottle of water, and a jacket without too much effort or force.Overall I would HIGHLY recommend it. This bag is built to be both functional and durable."
5,"Perfect, very highly recommended.","I bought this about three months ago and wanted to thoroughly test it before reviewing. I have never been happier with a purchase. Not only is this a perfect size, very sharp looking, and extremely durable, but the waterproofing isn't advertised enough on Amazon. On the third day I got it, already packed with most of my electronics, I dropped the whole thing in a puddle. I was worried until I looked inside, where it wasn't even damp. The bag dried out and life continued.It's rugged, useful, and protective. If you're looking for a bag, buy one of these."
5,A staple in our house.,This book is one of my absolute favorites. I love all of Lucado's childrens' books but this one holds a special place in my heart. It brings tears to my eyes. I just really love this one. Highly recommend.
5,Wonderful!,"I chanced upon this book at the children's section of Target. I bought it immediately. My daughter who was 3 at the time loved the way it seemed to be written just for her. The book is a wonderful way to affirm the love between parents and children. A way to let them know how enduring our love is, that it will always be there, no matter what. And also that God's love and our place in HIs kingdom is always there as well."
5,Perfect Bedtime Story,This is a book we will continue to read over and over again. My daughter (age 5) loves hearing the beginning where it talks about taking care of your child when they were first born. She always wants me to tell her about when she was a baby. I am buying two more to give as Christmas gifts.
2,A little unsettling.,"I bought this for my baby but upon reading it decided to give it to my 3 year old. It is definetely written for an older child with reference to when he/she is a baby. I am not a religious person. I did not buy this book because it was written by a religious author. I thought that it would be a beautiful childs story based on some exerpts written in a review about it. After reading it I wish I would have saved my money. Although nicely written, the entire second half of it was strangely about dying and all the wonderful things about it. I don't feel motivated to read this to my son because afterwards I feel compelled to remind him of all the good things about living. Was this written for a child who must deal with death? If so, It is beautiful and very informative without being frightening. It would definetly help your child to overcome the death of a loved one."
4,God made a decision to give you to me.,"After the initial aww I love this book factor, I reread the book from a ""would I buy this book for others"" perspective. A few things stood out that made me that made my decision a bit of a hard one. It reminded me of the kids book Love You Forever, which isn't necessarily bad, but I wasn't sure if the kids would be able to identify between the two books. It also didn't help that the illustrations were a bit dated in my perspective. I again read the book and felt like something was missing then I realized that it was like two books in one so in the end felt unfinished.In the end, the kids loved it and i got more teary eyed while I was reading it to the kids themselves. I would give this as a gift to other parents. My daughter was captivated by the book. Overall a great kids book."
3,A little disappointed,"I was disappointed when I looked through this little book. The content of the book itself is great, but all the pictures showed a little girl. It didn't have any pictures of little boys in it & since I got it for my grandson, I thought it didn't quite ""fit"". I know. It's a little thing, I guess. Maybe I'm too picky, but I think it would have been better to make the pictures with some girls & some boys in them. If that doesn't matter to you, then I certainly recommend this book. Max Lucado is a fine writer. I think he did a great job on his part."
2,Introduces possible negatives for children to expect,"This is a lovely book until you get to the part that tells the child what negatives to expect and that the parent will always be there to help with negatives. It's enough with the targeted age group just to say, as the book does in the beginning, that you and God are there to guide and love him or her. But laying the ground to expect bad grades and mean teachers (just one example) is not productive. And saying that you will ""always be on the child's side"" sets the child up to believe that you don't think he or she will ever make a mistake or be wrong or deserve punishment or correction from you! Better just to say that you will be there to help. I was disappointed because this book has some very nice parts, but I would not read it to my grandchildren. Life is hard enough without setting them up to fail. Two thumbs down on this one. Good Night God is a much better book."
4,A pleasant reminder,"I enjoy reading this book at bedtime for my son as a reminder that not only do I love him, but that I will always love him no matter what happens, no matter what he does. And it's a great way to tie in how my love for him is the same as God's is for him, but greater, even though he can't even see him. Storytime always ends with a hug and a kiss, particularly after this one. Another good book for children by Max Lucado."
4,Book Review: Just in Case You Ever Wonder,A sweet little book that helps to give a child perspective about a father's love. This example of a father's love helps to begin building a bridge of how God also loves them. I enjoyed the way he describes the uniqueness of the child and how God took such pleasure in creating them.I liked the examples of what things could be bad in a child's life and to give them a sense of knowing that father's are there for them even through the hard times. I love that it talks about teaching them about God and heaven. I see this book could become a favorite for our home. Thank you book sneeze for providing this book for us.Gracefully Daisy
4,Everyone needs to hear I love You,"I hope my son knows how much not only I, but how much the Lord loves him. Although this book is written for parents to read to their young children and I am a mother of a 20 year old ,I didn't let it stop me from reciting parts of it to him like ""But as you grow and change some things will remain the same... I'll always love you... I'll always be on your side...and I want you to know that... just in case you ever wonder."" I believe that no matter how young or old you are, a person needs to hear they are loved. The book is written through a parent sharing with their child that they are there for them from birth through heaven. Not only are they there for them but God is too. To me as a parent that is one of the most important things we can teach or children, God's love. That love is like a parents love, He protects and He is always there... just in case you ever wonder."
5,In case you ever wonder,"I have loved this book from afar for a while. Working in a Christian bookstore for most of my working life, I know good books from bad.And this is an excellent book, a must for every child's library.I received this from BookSneeze on Kindle, so I will be reading this to my daughter quite often now :)The story expresses what we as parents all want our children to know: they are very special, unique and have our hearts and this will never change.The ending is perfect; it talks about heaven.Disclosure of Material Connection: I received this book free from the publisher through the BookSneeze.com [...] book review bloggers program. I was not required to write a positive review. The opinions I have expressed are my own. I am disclosing this in accordance with the Federal Trade Commission's 16 CFR, Part 255 [...]: ""Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising."""
2,Not appropriate for young children,My 2 year old became too interested in the scary shadowy ghost like figure in the book. She would just sit and stare at it. Shortly after this she started having trouble sleeping. I ended up throwing it away. There are so many better books for parents who want to raise their children Christian. See my reviews for better options.
5,My 3 year old requests this book my name! Every night!,"Oh, I love this book,and I Love my 3 year old asks for it every night. It's such a wonderful story, about how you (his parents) will always love him, even as he grows up and changes, even when his grades are bad, and his teacher is mad. :) Even when he sees monsters in the closet (which my son always points out, Monsters are only pretend mommy) and that God made us and he loves us, too. we also love You are special about the Wemmicks and Punichello. I don't know if my son really ""gets it"", but it makes Mommy cry EVERY time. Get this book and You are special and you'll love reading it and cuddling with your child before prayers and night night time. We love it!"
5,Wonderful Book to Bond You With Your Little Ones!,"I knew this picture book by Max Lucado would be great because everything he write for both children and adults is always wonderful!Just in Case You Ever Wonder is a book both my children and I enjoyed. It's a sweet book to read aloud to them and teaches them that their father in Heaven and you, their mom or dad, will always love them no matter what.... just in case they ever wonder.""As you grow and change, some things will stay the same. I'll always love you. I'll always hug you. I'll always be on your side. And I want you to know that ... just in case you ever wonder.""The illustrations are colorful and the story is short and sweet... though not too short. You can see an excerpt here. This book would make a wonderful Christmas gift!The wonderful people at Booksneeze provided us with this book in exchange for a thoughtful and honest review."
2,Disappointed by the title,I was expecting much more of the book to be about my child with regard to reincarnation. It turned out to be very little about this. Most of it was just basic parenting stuff and surprisingly old fashioned in its tone. My sister was also looking for a book that didn't make you feel right or wrong about your choices. This is not one that fits that category at all! It seems to be a book that is in between New Age and Old Fashioned.
2,A slight disapointment,"Anyone who may be thinking this is a graphic novel is going to be disapointed. I had no clue what this was when I ordered it, it turned out to be a bunch of ruled pages with some Sandman art in the corner. If you're the kind of person that likes to keep a journal, or writes stories or poetry - then I'm sure you would appreciate the quality that went into it...a hard front and back cover, no snag double spiral binding, and nice high quality paper inside. But just to be clear, this is not a graphic novel."
5,"""THE PEABO REVIEW""","I HAVE LISTENED TO PEABO BRYSON FOR YEARS AND I THINK THAT NO OTHER EVEN COMES CLOSE TO HIS TALENT.THIS CD LIKE OTHER BY PEABO IS TO BE CHERISHED,HIS IS A PURE TALENT AND IT IS TIMELESS, I INVITE THOSE WHO ARE NEW FANS OF PEABO'S TO LISTEN AND FOR SURE BY THE CLOSE OF THE LAST SONG YOU WILL BE HOOKED.MICHEAL ADONIS."
4,Petzl Tikka Plus Headlamp,First the site did a great gob and got the product in time.and i'm very happy with this Headlamp. its just what i need.
5,Awesome light,"This light is very bright and the batteries last long. If you don't have one, get one. It's well worth $25."
3,Expensive for what you get,"I've used Petzl headlamps for many years. In fact, my old Zoom is still working great - now demoted from mountianeering duty because there are so many lighter options with comparable performance. The original Tikka was great when it was first available, but the competition has far surpassed it in terms of value. At $35, the new Tikka plus just can't compete with comparably priced models from Black Diamond or Princeton."
4,Panasonic Epilator/Shaver,"I read reviews prior to purchasing this item for my daughter, which warned about the pain involved with epilators. You do get used to it. The other design issue I have would be the very narrow epilating surface.You must make many passes to have a cleanly shaven area. These are my reasons for a 4 star rating. Still,it is definitely worth the pain and time required,as I have very fast growing hair, and it allows me to avoid this tiresome task for weeks!"
5,Best Epilator Ever,"I have used epilators on my legs for years, and this is the most effective and comfortable one ever. The pulling sensation is so minimal I even did my underarms with only mild discmfort the first time, and none the second time. One drawback with other epilators was never feeling as silky smooth as a razor shave does. This epilator delivers legs as smooth as a razor shave, but without any stubbly regrowth. I love being abke to use this in both the bath and shower, and rinse it totally clean. Dry epilators make a mess, but with this one you rinse evrything down the drain. I use regular bar soap for lather. I highly recommend this product."
1,mad at myself,"Sum it up by saying that I am mad at myself to realize that I have missed the 30 day deadline to return this item. No aspect of it (shaver, trimmer, epilator) works as I had hoped/expected. I have a (very old fashioned) Epilady with the spring mechanism that works better."
5,The echo,"""Echoes"" is one of the most amazing songs you'll ever hear. After listening to all 23 minutes of it, you'll be amazed that it was actually that long. It's transitions are smooth, the lyrics are ominous, and Gilmour's guitar effects are amazing. The rest of the album is great, with it's aim at achieving a subtle mood throughout. I especially like ""One of these days"" and ""Fearless"". When I think of Meddle, I think of a far away land full of caves, mountains, and oceans. A great pre-dark side album, and album to lounge around to."
5,Roger Waters was one of only 5 genuises to ever live,"I say this because it is true. Specifically, Meddle is a genius album. You can almost imagine being part of the crew of a barnacle as they voyage ""through the land""..."
5,One Of These Albums,"A great pink floyd album one the most beautiful of them all.The songs are most acustic guitar played wonderful tunes like a pillow of winds one of my favorite songs on the album and the hard rocking opening track One of this days, Seamus is a funny song about a dog that will sound strange the first time you hear it. And then there is the epic ending song Echoes a real master pieace of a song with some creepy sound effects by Wright realy cool. If your a Floyd fan you cant live with out this master album if your not a floyd friend you still cant."
2,nostalgia,"Pink Floyd is one of those bands I don't get. By that I mean I don't get why everyone has such a boner over them. Whatever I'm not here to judge.Picked this album up on the cheap recently. Its very nostalgic for me. I used to love it when I didn't know any better and that's what my stoner friends listened to.I still appreciate the sound of the songs vs. the songs themselves. For example ""Fearless"" has such a clean sound its sorta blissful. ""San Tropez"" has a coral feel, close your eyes and you can see fish swimming by and a fat bastard in a Hawaiian shirt drinking a fufu drink.The actual song portion of Echoes has a nice sound to it but buyer beware 10 minutes of the 23 minutes is complete unlistenable swill,not even in a artsy fartsy Sonic Youth kind of way"
5,TRANSITIONIAL TIME FOR THE BAND.. A CLASSIC [ TALENT...ONCE AGAIN.]..,I FEEL THAT THIS RECORDING IS THE BEST OF ALL OF THIER WORK; SEEMS THAT THEY FOUND A SORT OF ''GROWTH OF TALENT'' WITHIN THEM PERHAPS SOME KIND OF '' A ENLIGHTENMENT '' TRULY A TEMPLATE IN MANY AREAS REGUARDING; PROGRESSIVE ; CONCEPT; ROCK.... A CLASSIC.. WISH THAT THEY COULD BE INDUCTED IN'' ROCK HALL OF FAME''...THEY DESERVE IT BY FAR...
4,A Pink Floyd classic!,"While not flawless, Meddle is certainly an enjoyable prog/psych album.One Of These Days ***- Good bass driven song, but could have been shorterA Pillow of Winds *****- One of my favorite tracks on the album. A slow, atmospheric song with some lovely slide guitarFearless *****- Great lyrics, nice little acoustic riff, ranks with the best of the FloydSan Tropez ***- Okay, okay, its not a great track, but it's pleasing to the earSeamus **- Skip itEchoes *****- Its worth buying the album just for this track. A 23 minute psychadelic symphony that NEVER seems to grow dull. Roger provides some excellent lyrics as well. Unforgettable"
4,Excellent Album,"I hold that this album is among the best that Pink Floyd has produced.While One of These Days is, in my opinion, one of there best songs. Yet on this album, it is not nearly as good as the different version on the Delicate Sound of Thunder.Fearless - San Tropez are all mediocre songs and are all very forgettable. But three of the four stars of my review are from the 23 minute track Echos. This is a simply excellent song very similar to those found on the first disk of the Delicate Sound of Thunder."
5,Pink Floyd Never Ceases To Amaze...,"I am what you might call a ""intermediate"" Pink Floyd fan. I have been exposed to a lot of their work, but have only recently experienced the musical journey that is ""Meddle"". If you have any history with Pink Floyd, this album will render you nearly motionless in delight. But the real beauty of this album, lies in its ability to appeal to even the casual listener. That is of course, with the exception of ""Echoes"", which remains the finest musical emulation of an acid trip to date. Personally, I make time (about 23 minutes) every week to rediscover the depth-of-thought, and utter madness that is ""Echoes"". The album is worth every cent. But more over, ""Meddle"" is worthy of your time, and intellectual consideration."
4,Meddling with powers they were beginning to understand,"It was becoming clear at this point that this group would be for more than the acid-hippie-freakout demographics they played into priorly. Meddle showed Floyd at their straightforwardly best, effortlessly substituting psychedelic folk for blues rock without the slightest contrivances."
4,no meddling just greatness,"Meddle is a real good pink floyd cd. One of these days is great.Pillar of wind is beautiful outstanding vocal Fearless has good lyrics and sounds from a soccer game Santropaiz is different for floyd Seamus is a classic areal dog barks to some fine blues only floyd could make Seamus work or even try. Echoes is a classic song also the birds and music blend together to make a floyd masterpiece Gilmours guitar brings an heroic sound to this dark seascape, Meddle is a quality floyd cd."
4,Lest we forget the earlier years of The Floyd....,"Short and sweet review: My nightly commute to my stressful job is about 30 minutes of desolate interstate. Some nights I'll put ""Meddle"" in the CD player, and the 25 minutes go by fast. 30 miles in 25 minutes? Yes, I drive fast.Fighting the morning rush traffic going home in the morning is much easier thanks to the 23-minute ""Echoes"" track.""Meddle"" is probably my third favorite Pink Floyd disc, just behind ""Animals"" and ""Wish You Were Here"". No radio-friendly hits here, just interestingly crafted music that is in such short supply lately.Only drawback - my copy is from the box set ""Shine On"", and those albums included in that box set don't sound as good as the remastered versions that would hit the stores years later. In fact, the volume sounds a bit muted. But that's what the volume knob is for, right?"
1,This CD STINKS,This CD was one of the worst of Pink Floyd I ever heard. Don't buy it! I gave it to my sister who is an avid fan and she thought this one stunk also.
2,a frigging felony,This Godawful CD is a frigging felony.It should be banned out of shape!!There are a/ no decent songsb/ there is no frigging decent innasleevesand 3 the music is terribles!!!Jonah
5,The Return of the Son of Nothing Parts 1-26,"that was the original title when they performed it live before entering the studio, as i recall. the trouble with reviewing a pink floyd album is that they are all so terribly good. i wanted to give this one 4 stars because of Seamus. A song about a barking dog which, as a special guest on that particular song, barks to no rythym at all, but instead to his own chaotic distractions. whines as well. However the full 20+minutes version of Echoes...regains that star as without Seamus this album would be a 10, but with, it is a six. still off the scale, but without echoes would be a 4. You see the logic? ...Get Shine On, better value, bigger book, specialer package."
5,A classic,"A classic ""old"" Pink Floyd CD.If you liked it in the 1960's, you will like it now. If you like Pink Floyd, you will probably like this CD."
4,Reach for a Peach,"Many folks, me included, can tell you the exact time and place they first heard Meddle. Of all the Pink Floyd recordings, this may be my favorite, but I have to confess that it sounds a bit dated these days. Still, the music here captures the band at a moment when their early experimentalism, which reached its nadir with ""Atom Heart Mother,"" and the bloated excess of their stadium rock such as ""Animals"" are kept at bay. There is a bit of everything here, from the lilting San Tropez, to the playfulness of Fearless, to the masterful water-pipe ode Echoes.If you don't have this PF CD, you should. The boys are in fine form here, letting their strong musical talents push the music. The studio hijinx so lauded on ""Dark Side of the Moon"" and the subsequent body of their work can be detected here, but these are kept in check."
4,the sounds are the best to sleep by,I used to listen to this 8 track when I was in 8th grade. Loved it then and still love it today.
5,Awesome!!,"This album is in the ""Top 5"" of my favorite Pink Floyd albums. Whilst everyone is hooked on ""Dark Side of the Moon"", this one is even better (but that's just me). It starts off just right with ""One of These Days"" and concludes with the 23 1/2 minute long ""Echoes"". An old English teacher gave me an old BBC bootleg tape of theirs from back in 71' and it had ""rough-take"" early versions of the 2 songs mentioned and I was like ""Yeah I definitely need this one""! I bought the album a few hours later and loved every song! If you're a ""Floyd"" fan, pick one up and enjoy!"
5,First Great Post Syd Album,"This is the album where Post-Syd Floyd really comes into its own. Every track is a keeper, even if ""Seamus"" might feel a little like filler. ""One of these Days"" is a killer instrumental, remniscent of King Crimson. Though all of the tracks are noteworthy, including the unfairly criticized, beautifully jazzy ""San Tropez"" it is the first track, the previously mentioned ""One of these Days"" and the epic ""Echoes"" which truly stand out as all-time Floyd classics. Echoes is very atmospheric and uniquely beautiful; over 20 minutes in length, it passes by much more quickly than would be imagined, practically hypnotizing the listener into a trance. Any fan of Floyd that has the other classics and wonders where to go next is recommended to check out Meddle. I may even go as far as calling it essential listening for Floyd fans if not for all classic rock/progessive rock fans; it is a fine and thoroughly enjoyable album that is infinitely relistenable and entrancing."
3,variety pack of broken biscuits,"After the misjudged 'angry disco' track of One Of These Days ( a better version appears on Delicate Sound of Thunder) , the band hit their stride on gloriously hippyish songs like Fearless, drawing on folk and Liverpool FC with it. San Tropez is fun, though slightly cheesy but things really go down hill with Seamus, a dull, white man's blues track which sounds very out of place. All is forgiven though, for Echoes - over 20 minutes of what Prog Rock should be - dreamy, pretentious, uplifting and chilled out, which never outstays it's time frame"
3,"Half bore, half magical.","After the disaster that was 'Atom Heart Mother', Pink Floyd released 'Meddle', an album signaling the beginning of their greatness. It is not without is major flaws. The first half is incredibly boring, with only one good song. I forget which one, but it goes something like ""born with a silver spoon in your mouth"". The second half is just plain magical.'Echoes' is one of the greatest longest songs I've heard. It is constructed with simplicity and played beautifully. There is a long section where no music is played, but then from the darkness, the instruments the intruments reappear, and what you hear will be nothing but pure magic."
3,Not as Good as people say it is,"When I got this cd, I thought it was going to be great like the other pink floyd cds I have. It wasn't. The first three songs are all right, but San Tropez is just stupid sounding. Seamus is so annoying that I never listened to it after the day I got it. Echoes would of been better if it wasn't so long. I would get better Pink Floyd like The Wall,Dark Side of the Moon,Wish you were here, and Animals. All these CDs are great. Don't waste your money on this CD."
4,Most underrated album,"An amazing album that paved the way for Dark Side of the Moon. Echoes alone makes this worth buying. It is easily one the Floyd's best and can stand up to pretty much any other song recorded. The album as a whole is great with weaker tracks like ""Seamus"" bringing it down a little. The opener ""One of These Days"" is a great instrumental piece and ""pillow of Winds"" is is a nice relaxing song with a floating quality."
4,2 de las mejores canciones de PF estan aqui,"Pudeo hacer una Revision Rapida de este disco solo diciendo que en este disco estan: ONE OF THESE DAYS y ECHOES, dos de las mejores canciones de la historia, el resto del disco no se queda atras, con toques de jazz, blues, peor insisto la entrada de OOTD y la despedida con ECHOES, pagan el disco....."
4,a really quality album with a variety in styles of music,"pink floyd blues? thats what i thought too, but this album is really put together well with song order... ONE OF THESE DAYS and then also the acoustic songs. very musical. but if any word would descrbe this album, it would pretty much be ECHOES. one of my favorite songs. a total trip. 23 minutes of listening ecstasy."
3,worth a listen for any Floyd fan,"This won't be confused with Dark Side of the Moon or The Wall, but this early effort shows Floyd growing into the musical geniuses they became.""One of these days"" remains a Floyd classic, and ""Echoes"" becomes better and better with each listen."
4,The middle seems empty,"My most favorite Pink Floyd song ever is on this album: Echoes. The first track of the album, One of These Days is really good too. But the rest of the songs I just couldn't get into. And I just flat out didn't like Seamus. The songs besides the first and last almost seemed like 'filler' songs. But I like One of These Days and Echoes so much, I still gave this album 4 stars. Echoes is a song I like a lot because of its astounding originality and experimental soungs. It was a masterpiece. This album I found worth getting just because of the two songs."
5,The Beginning of the Classic Era,"In my opinion, everything that Pink Floyd released from 1971 to 1979 is a classic masterpiece. ""Meddle"", released in 1971, was the first of many classic albums to come.""One of These Days"" and ""Echoes"" are the standout tracks, but the melancholic beauty of ""A Pillow of Winds"" also ranks up there with the best of Floyd. ""San Tropez"" is a nice little jazzy number sung by Roger Waters. Not one of his best, either musically or lyricly, but still fun.""Seamus"" seems to be the only real throwaway song. Two minutes of a dog barking over some slow blues played by David Gilmour. Pink Floyd would use barking dogs to much greater effect on the ""Animals"" album several years later.Overall, a very solid album, with two ""essential"" Floyd masterpieces (with ""Echoes"" taking up one whole half of the album). I wouldn't recommend this as a first purchase, but it would definitely be in my top five."
4,I am not much of a Pink Floyd fan.....,"...but having drowned myself throughout life with alternative, punk, ska, jazz, big band, etc. I have begun digging back into classic rock.One day I was listening to Music Choice on cable and the song ""Fearless"" came on. I recall hearing the song back in high school and most likely dismissed it as ""hippie crap."" I enjoyed the flow of the tune and downloaded the album.I listened to the album closely and instantly dug it. A couple of the later tracks made me realize how one of my favorite artists, Beck, must really like this album. I am not saying Beck Hanson ripped them off but some of the songs sound awfully similar to a few of Beck's numbers (see his album ""Mutations""). If you like this album I would highly suggest you picking up Beck's ""Mutations"" -- a great album.I would suggest this album to any fan of music."
4,Like Nothing Else...,"All Pink Floyd has it's own very unique sound, but this album has a really unique one. I don't consider it as active and great as Dark Side of the Moon or The Wall, but really, it's something really nice to put on and just, listen to. Very calming, great music. To all you kids/ tenneagers, don;t turn it off if you get bored just because it's not as active, listen, you'll love it."
5,a masterpiece,"meddle was the fourth best album after the dark side of the moon,the wall and wish you were here and this album is one of my favourites due to the presence of great songs like one of these days and the 23 minute epic echoes.i wish i could have given this classic album more than five stars.highly recommended."
5,Another great Floyd album,"after listening to Animals, I thought I'd give meddle a try.Well this is one one my favorites by far. and echoes what tune.well I would say buy any and every floyd cd you can they are all great, you'll never be dissapointed. I just wish they would get back together again."
4,The best of Pink Floyd's early albums,"This is the best pre-""Dark Side of the Moon"" Pink Floyd album and the only one that does not sound horribly dated. The musical ideas that would fuel the master work ""Dark Side"" were already being toyed with here. Especially on the side-long ""Echoes,"" which is draggy at times but concludes on a high point of sound and energy. The rest isn't too bad either. Floyd was a fully functioning four piece band at this stage (rather than a Roger Watters dominated group) and the singing and songwriting reflect that. Overall, a very good album that only hints at what was to come."
4,Compared to ... the 2011 remaster,"I just got done listening to three versions of Echoes and most of the rest of Meddle...from the 1992 Shine On box set, my 1974 Japanese vinyl copy (rendered in digital format through Audacity and the Apple Format AAC exporter)and the 2011 remaster.My 1974 Japanese pressing still beats the pants off all the CD versions, including the 2011 remaster, but not everyone is going to find a copy...So, there is a little improvement over the 1992 mastering(in my pedestrian opinion...I'm no Audio Jedi Master...) but not enough, in my opinion to justify replacing your Pink Floyd catalog.On the other hand, the 2011 packaging is very nice, restoring something of the old LP approach and including a lot of pictures and text that were left off of other packages.I'm a bit of a Pink Floyd fanatic, so I'm happy to have three copies of Meddle (and four or more of Wish You Were Here and Dark Side of the Moon), but I can't recommend that kind of obsession to everyone."
5,Echoes!,"The question of exactly how good this album is could be debated endlessly. But it's a moot point, because you could throw away the entire first side of ""Meddle"" and still have 23 minutes of the most beautiful, unique, and uplifting music ever recorded.I cannot explain ""Echoes"" to you. I have no desire to try, because any words I could use would be pale and ugly next to the beauty of this music. You will have to take my word for it.Buy this album. Listen to side one if you want - ""Fearless"" at least is quite good. And then sit back in your chair, turn on ""Echoes"", and think of the noontime sun, shining over a distant sea."
3,RIP Syd - 1946-2006,"This album with ""Wish you Were Here"" were the first 2 albums that introduced me to my Pink Floyd era.Although the 24 minutes epic ""Echoes"" is great and I also liked the ""One of These Days"" at the start, I would say that too start your Pink Floyd experience the albums ""Animals"",""Wish you were Here"",""The Wall"" and ""the Final Cut"" are all better than this CD, and if you want the best Pink Floyd songs in one collection, to become a real Floyd fan you should get the ""Echoes - Greatest Hits"" and DSOTM albums.If you want the Syd Barrett Songs then the albums Relics, Works and The Piper at the Gates of Dawn, are all good ones to buy.However as my first Floyd album I'll always remember this one with fond memories.RIP Syd - you started one of the greatest bands of all time."
4,Recipe For Meddle,"You will need:1 Atom Heart Mother album, orchestra, horn arrangements and breakfast song removed1 singing dogA pinch of Doctor Who-esque sounds1 cup of space sounds10 cups of David Gilmour's writing and playing talents10 cups of Roger Waters' writing and playing talents10 cups of Richard Wright's writing and playing talents10 cups of Nick Mason's writing and playing talents1 vocal line from Nick MasonOne ear, underwaterMethod:1 Place Atom Heart Mother album in bowl, start to mix with an electric mixer2. Slowly add the Doctor Who-esque sounds, then the dog, then the space sounds and beat well on medium until well-mixed3. Add all other ingredients and beat on high until well-mixed4. Pour everything into large cake tin5. Bake in an oven at 200 degrees Celsius for 8 months6. Tip out and leave to cool for another 2 months. Decorate with underwater earA good album from Pink Floyd!"
2,WRONG IMPORT,"Whoever is selling this item is lying about it being a UK or ""Great Britain"" import he listed the american label and the UK imports label is EMI Harvest SHVL 795 I know because I own the real 1st issue UK edition.Therefore if your looking for the UK imported Meddle record I highly suggest that you look somewhere else"
2,A Dull Album!!!,"I love Pink Floyd but truthfully, I think this a horrible Floyd album, and if you wanna buy an album from the Pre-Dark Side era, buy any Floyd album except this one. The only good track on this album is One of These Days, which is an instrumental. Echoes, the most epic song on this album would've great had they not made it 23 minutes long! Pillow of Winds and Fearless are OK, but San Tropez and Seamus are just filler. Roger Waters still hasn't quite developed his singing voice, and you can easily tell that they double tracked him. All in All this album's just another brick in Pink Floyd's history."
2,Its alright if you need help sleeping.,"Man oh man I just know some die hard Floyd fans are gonna be mad at me but hey Im entitled to my own opinion too.I myself absolutely love Dark Side Of The Moon,Wish You Were Here and most of The Wall but this cd puts me to sleep everytime.I could have 6 bottles of Jolt cola and still be bored with this album.Nothing stands out its just one big yawn after another.If you have any real taste in music avoid this."
4,4 1/2 stars!!!! GREAT,"This is where is all begins for the great career of a fine, fine band. This album JUST WORKS- Its got a great range- full of many different sounds- A MUST OWN for a rock fan!!!!!!!!"
5,After a year,"I've had them on my Chevy s-10 for over a year. They fit well and do what they were meant to do-let some air in/out without rain getting in. They were a little difficult to install. First one took nearly 45 minutes,but 2nd one less than 10Read the instructions and then read them again Use the window to help put pressure on them to pop the clips in to place."
5,Amazingly inspirational book,"""When the circumstances of our lives are not changed, it does not mean that healing is not occurring,"" writes Buckley in his introduction. ""We are not always repaired. We are sometimes re-created."" Although this appears to be a children's book, the message if far from juvenile. In fact, I bought the book for myself. The story is truly inspirational and has the distinct feel of a Native American legend. I am very fond of Ray Buckley, and this is as good as the rest of his works. By one for a present, and another one for yourself."
5,Farm Owner/Operator,I have had this product for a number of yrs. It has always proven tough. The Bat. last long enough. The drill does the work other brands do with higher voltage. I have been very pleased
4,I love Shemar Moore!!!!,If you love Shemar Moore as much as I do then this movie is deffinetly for you. It's a light comedy that is sure to brighten up your day!
3,Too Many Coincidences,"In all the Maisie Dobbs novels, I like Maisie. A lot. She is a strong character who seeks the truth and does the right thing. She is kind, compassionate, and hard-working. And the 1930s setting that Maisie lives in is likewise interesting: the time between two world wars, with fascism on the rise in Germany.I have read all the novels, and the ones I have enjoyed the most are those in which the mystery or mysteries presented for Maisie to solve are important, are difficult to solve, but are solved by Maisie's hard work. While I did not dislike Pardonable Lies, and while I have to say I enjoyed traveling with Maisie to many different places, I didn't feel satisfied by this story. There were coincidences: too many. There were lies: too important to overlook. I'm happy to say that I felt the two books before this one, and some of those after this one, were better."
4,would have given 5 stars...but,"I would have easily given this wonderful story five stars, were it not for the very poor translation from paper media to digital. I read the Kindle version, and I would estimate there were at least 100 uncorrected errors, possible to read, but distracting."
3,Paardonable Lies,"The story continues about a young woman detective after WW I. Masie is a great character, but this edition was a little slow and not as intriguing as the first two books."
1,Confusing,"I had not read a book by this author before but ""Pardonable Lies"" was recommended to me. I found this book hard to follow. I kept getting the characters confused for the most part. There was too much misc. info. surrounding the plot. I will not buy another novel by this author. Very disappointed. The characters came and went with little to remind you of where you had read about them before. Will not recommend."
5,"Maisie Dobbs, my Hero!","I was hooked on Maisie Dobbs mysteries after reading the first one. My plan to read them all in numerical order has been an exceedingly pleasureable experience. In each book, the author has increased her skills at building the storyline and infused the subject with intrigue, increasing interest in character, and delivered timing of events in the stories beautifully. Her research into the art world and in the mood of the times in ""jolly old England"" leaves me with new insights into that part of history post WW 1. This is by far the best of Maisie. I can't wait to move on to the next in her series of Maisie Dobbs (a quite addictive series indeed). I am confident that our author just does not fail to excite the mystery reader's mind with her writing accomplishments. Thank you Jacqueline Winspear!!"
5,Jacqueline Winspear,"This is a very good author and I have all her books, so I was glad to get such a book in such good shape and fast service too."
4,Maisie Dobbs: History and Mystery,"For those of us who enjoy a historical novels as well as a little mystery, the Maisie Dobbs series has all parts covered. This book in the series takes us on a more personal view of Maisie as she confronts her past demons from WW1 while chasing her clients' demons.Jacqueline Winspear does a wonderful job of creating a believable, and accurate, world in which Maisie exists as an independent female detective. Maisie's life is one of meditation, patience, facts and practicality rather than romance and intrigue. However, her problems as well as her clients problems are surprisingly modern in nature. A must-read for mystery lovers..."
3,Mystery with emotional lining,"This book starts slowly to get us accustomed to Maisie Dobbs, and then pries into her emotionally sensitive side, before getting us to the stage of sequential deduction that's the ""work"" of solving most mysteries. The likable Ms. Dobbs rapidly grew on me, and I found myself hoping for many things for her, including a deliverance from some of her pain. The mystery unfolds well, but cautiously, which leads this book to its final stage, where it is more an exegesis of the pains and reasons why for WWI, and in that, is highly critical of many human tendencies. I liked it but its historical context was soberingly lugubrious."
4,Solution to bushing problem for 2-1/4 HP Triton,"After many go-rounds with Triton Customer Service, I decided to try their bushings for use in the 2-1/4 HP router. As it turns out, you can also use your Porter Cable bushings using the parts supplied in this kit. I just wish Triton had made that clear at the outset. I would have saved a lot of time."
5,MACK JUMP JUNKIE,MACK JUMP RULES--best money ever spent on a cd - recommend this to everyone who has a chance to get it
1,Now there is only ONE Star,"To Cusco and Cusco Fans... The music from this CD saved my life. Peace, Power, and Proud to be alive Is what comes from this CD. There is only one star. and thats CUSCO! Grate Job Guys. Hi Art Bell"
4,Inspirational Music,I discovered Cusco on one the Pure Moods CDs and have started my own library. Many of the songs have helped inspire me as I write speeches or papers for class or business. I listen to them at work and they help me through the day. I used Montezuma as a background for my college speech class promoting the Miata. My professor said she could almost feel herself driving the car. We used Flying Condor as my daughter's wedding march. Our DJ said that it was one of the best songs he had ever heard and was impressed by our choice. It's even great to just listen to and read the newspaper or relax.
4,"Ron Dante, A hell of a singer",I first heard this album when I was 13 yrs. old. I had taken the album off the back of a delivery van. My original album had NOT FOR SALE / FOR PROMOTIONAL USE ONLY stamped into the jacket. Unforunately a so called friend decided to sell all my albums (800) in all while storing them for me. I just can't say enough good things about the songs on this one. They have a good message to them and will lift your spirits if your down.
1,Don't bother!!!!,"First let me say I know this album well, and it is essential for any fan of Ron Dante, or the Archies. The problem here is that the mastering is so godawful poor! It seems to be mastered from a record-and judging from the nauseating sound of all the side two tracks (6-10), the record used was pressed off-center!!! Artwork bears no resemblance to original, and mine came with a booklet but no tray card! Add to that the fact that 2 tracks are missing from the original release, and this makes the disc useless. Most Dante fans already have a copy of the vinyl, and that is a superior copy to own at this point. Wait for Ron to reissue this himself-he'll do better..."
4,"Fine album, but wait for the official release","Do yourself a favor and get this album on vinyl then transfer it to CD-R. The import disc is a definite bootleg with questionable quality plus a couple of the songs from the album are missing. On top of that, the stereo is reversed...! Try Gemm.com or other vinyl vendors to find it.When it does get it's official CD release, I hope Ron Dante puts the remixed version of ""C'mon Girl"" on it. The strings throughout really make a difference.UPDATE!!!!! Ron Dante released the 10 songs on this album on iTunes. Amazon has mp3's of the songs."

2,buyer beware,this is not a novel - in fact it is only 26 pages long. i made the mistake of thinking it was a full length novel. i hope i can help some other Laymon fans here.
2,outstanding,Five stars!. Excellent instructions for applique with pictures to demonstrate their words. Basic applique primer. Your resource book.
3,JUST GLAD I CAN GET THESE Advance does not carry,21 YEAR OLD VEHICLE GETTING HARDER TO GET PARTS THAT ARE NEW. NEED ALOT OF OTHER THINGS FOR IT TO
1,A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT,"I CANNOT BELIEVE THE POOR CHOOICE OF MUSIC FOR THIS CD.I WAS HEART-BROKEN.THE SONGS DO NOT SOUND LIKE THE QUALITY OF RONNIE MILSAP'S PREVIOUS RELEASES. OTHER THAN A RE-DO OF ""WHAT A DIFFERENCE YOU MADE IN MY LIFE"" WHICH WAS COMPLETELY UN-NECESSARY, THIS CD WAS NOT WORTH BUYING.SORRY RONNIE."
1,INCORRECT TRACK LISTING,"I BELIEVE THIS IS A LIVE ALBUM WITH THE TEN TRACKS LISTED ABOVE, BUT THE LENGTH SUMMARY SHOWS 11 TRACKS FOR THE CD LABELED 'RONNIE MILSAP'.THAT CD (NOT THE BRANSON ONE SHOWN IN THE PICTURE) IS THE CORRECT ONE FOR THE LENGTHY REVIEW GIVEN HERE, AND IT HAS THE SAME 11 TRACK REVIEW IF YOU LOOK FOR IT ON AMAZON!"
4,Beautiful,"I don't think another word can sum it up quite so perfectly. There are passages I find myself quoting to people (something I rarely do) because they are beyond eloquent. Although there isn't a typical plot, what you grasp/feel/understand about (the life of) Joanna is more than in most books that lead you from start to finish. A truly remarkable first novel and worthy of everyone's time."
5,An Astonishing Debut,"A wonderful book through and through. I don't have much more to say besides ""READ IT!!!!"" You won't be disappointed. By the way, ignore Kirkus Reviews. They suck."
2,Streetglow Fast and Furious,"The lights were relatively easy to install and worked perfectly for all of 3 weeks. After trying to get the replacement bulb replaced under the 1 yr warranty that we were told came with it, we came up totally empty. The manufacturer no longer makes these lights and therefore cannot offer a warranty on them. The retailer offered a 30 day warranty which didnt help since we installed them after Christmas. WHAT A BUST!"
4,Best Westcoast Compilation,"this cd is real tight. it has all of the best awol artists ever and they are all tight. they come with the best flows from the west and with freddie smith behind controlling the switches in the backround you can't go wrong. all the flows from want some get some, killa tay in killa who and you will for sure wanna creep listening to 4 eva creep with that mysterious ass beat. there are not many perfect cds out there and if it was not for the very few space fillers this would be one."
4,its good,buy it. its better than any mainstream west coast rap (dr. dre snoop dog) or anything from the east coast (insert name of east coast rap artist here!)
1,disappointed,I purchased this game because I really enjoyed playing the older version of it a few years ago on my parents computer. My daughter and I loved playing that game. This version was very disappointing. There is no Alex Trebek voice over. The count down to answering a question seems shorter too. My daughter thought it was boring so we have only played it once.
1,BEWARE!!! Does not run on Vista.,This is the last time I purchased a product from Encore. The game does not run on my computer with Vista!!! The support information on the Encore Support Website is worthless bla bla. I called Encore. They offer no telephone support for Jeopardy. What a ripoff. I recommend that you to STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT and I suggest that you reconsider before buying any product from ENCORE. I think no company should get away with treating their customers like this.
1,Great game gone bad..suggestions for next release,"Multiple choice is obviously a bad idea. I have a suggested fix for the next version: Allow the player to enter his answer. If he misspells and the game doesn't give him credit, allow the player to override the game and take the points. The creater of this game is way to serious about protecting the answers. Its a game! Even if the player decides to cheat...so be it. As long as he is having fun. This multiple choice stuff is just plain stupid. (hopefully I didn't misspell anything in my review)"
1,"I'll take garbage for $20, Alex","My wife and I are big JEOPARDY fans. We have an older version (JEOPARDY! 2nd edition) which works fine on our computer. The graphics are good, but come on 2nd edition. So I thought we would update. You would think that the graphic would be really awesome by now and computer compatibility wouldn't be any problem,wrong!Don't waste your money on this game. Hasbro or their tech team at ARTECH don't have a clue. The graphics aren't ATARI quality and the game crashes like a sleepy newborn."
1,Sad,"Sadly, i have to tell you that this game does not run in XP, or Vista.i tried in 4 machines, 2 of them new!I am very dissapointed, because in the info of the product they do not advice any other special requirements, but after 4 differents machines, i prefered forget the issue."
4,MAKES ME THINK,I got this game to exercise my brain and it does that. I try to play once a day and it's definitely worth it in entertainment value.
4,Fun Game,"This is a fun game and the multiple choice feature is okay, but the game is best displayed on large screen TV. I's difficult reading the column titles and questions on the computer and once you've figured it out, the response time is up. My family loves Jeopardy (tv and computer versions), so it was a good buy."
3,Works fine after you D/L the patch,"For those of you that have had crashing troubles with the game, there's a patch available [...]The game itself? Pretty decent trivia game, multiple choice not the greatest idea... Graphics are quite dated."
1,Won't work.,"The first game installed to 3 different computers, but would not play on any of them (XP, Vista, Windows 7). Amazon replaced it and the second game wouldn't even instal. Sent both back for refund."
1,Jeopardy game,"I purchased this product after making sure it would work on my computer's operating system. However, when I tried to load it, it would not work. I did contact the seller and got a return mailer, and was to be given credit for the return on my card. The seller was courteous, but since the product was meant to work and didn't, I was disappointed. I bought another product at the same time from the same seller, and it worked just fine."
1,jeopady,"Will not worki on windows 7 64 bit, spent money on a product that will not work I am dissapointed"
2,Bad Version,"I already knew about the bad reviews, but wanted to buy the game anyway since our family loves playing Jeopardy on the computer and it had not been a new one since 2003.Well the game is pretty bad, first the game does not work. I had to find out through Encore's message forum that you must change the date on your computer to January 2, 2008 to get the game to work. You can do this by right clicking the time on the right corner of your computer screen the adjust the date.Multiple choice is corny, Jeopardy is never multiple choice. There's no voices, sound, or fun to the game. Encore developed the game way too fast with very little thought process. Only cool thing is creating the person.Overall, still can be a little trivia multiple choice fun, but we'll be popping back in the 3 older PC versions of Jeopardy to play in the future."
1,Oxford does not live up to its reputation,This product does not live up to the scholarly level of quality that one expects from Oxford. The software company FINGER used to run the program does not offer a 1-800 number for technical support...I thought this product might be compatable to Encarta Encyclopedia...not even close! Do not purchase this software...purchase Encarta or Britanica; and make sure the software is not operated by FINGER. Shame on Oxford for allowing their name and reputation to be tarnished!
5,Awesome!!!!,"This is the best car seat at an awesome price. Considering all the beatings that most car seats face during your child's 3 years of use, this is definitely a great car seat. I thought hard about getting a Britax, but the money spent on a Britax vs. the money spent on this one, well it was a no-brainier! This car seat is just as safe if not safer than the Britax (packed with hard Styrofoam), it is about the same size, so much softer and much more padding than a Britax. And here's the kicker, its more than $100 less!! Like I said, a no-brainier! I've heard about the shorter strap issue, but my 1 yr old DS is an average size, (50th to 60th %tile for both ht and wt) and we have no problems and plenty of room to grow. I very highly recommend this seat."
1,Hate This Car Seat,"I purchased this seat a few months ago online because of the fantastic reviews I had read and it also looked very comfortable. However, when I strapped my 1 year old daughter into it, the straps seemed to be quite tight and with a coat on, forget it, she just was not going to fit. I thought the seat must be defective so I called Evenflo and after about a month of phone calls, a new seat finally arrived. Same problem. The straps are maybe one inch longer. My daughter at one year was 20 lbs and slightly taller than average. I have no idea how a 40lb child would fit in this seat. Now that she's 15 months it's like she's strapped into a stragiht jacket. I have to warm up the car before she enters it because there's no way she can fit with any kind of jacket on.Would love to sell this seat because we will NEED to purchase another one. We have an inexpensive Graco in my husband's truck that we just love! Sorry Evenflo, will never purchase another one."
4,Very comfortable for baby,"I poked a lot of car seats to see how well cushioned they were - I was surprised how many were hard as a rock. This model is wonderfully soft and my son loves it. The crank wheel to get the harness tightned could be redesigned to have a better release - sometimes I have a hard time putting enough pressure on the lever to get it released. It also was not great for rear facing, because it just couldn't recline enough and my son's neck wasn't strong enough to keep his head up. I would still recommend an infant car seat for when they are little and rear facing. But, once he was over 20lbs, we tried it again and the car seat worked great. He falls asleep in the seat on almost every car ride!"
2,Too Frustrated To Continue Using This Carseat,"At first I loved this carseat and thought I had made the right decision, but soon discovered I had not. The straps were too much work for me...I don't want to be in rain/snow/freezing temps trying to fight the straps. They wouldn't losen or tighten correctly, and they kept falling off my son's shoulders. I read ALL the reviews to try and solve these problems, but found they did not work. I ended up going with the Britax Marathon, and found that it is much easier to install and put my child into. After all the frustration with the Evenflo, I couldn't wait to take my son places. Yes, the Britax is more money, but I would rather pay more money and have my sanity when putting my child in his carseat."
2,Straps slipped off 9 month old's shoulders,"I've seen it used with great success with toddlers but it was awful for my 9 month old. After years with a Britax Roundabout I was determined not to spend that much money this time. I bought this seat and my 3 problems with it were 1.Straps slipped down off of my son's shoulders(big boy) 2. The leather trim, if I read correctly, is not washable and 3. the double strap system confused me and I kept getting his arms tangled in them. (...) Just know it's not for everyone so try it out before you toss the box as i almost did."
2,Some good features...but not for long.,"It's a crying shame to pay this much for a car seat that will not allow you to put a 27 lb. toddler with his coat on in the seat and still be able to fasten the straps. I had an Alpha Omega for my first child...I'm sorry I didn't get another one for baby #2. We liked this seat at first...lots of padding...seemed very cozy and comfortable. Now that our baby is a toddler, not so great. Also, it rattles when no one is riding in it...very annoying. If you have a ""tall"" car (we have a suburban) you may not like it. The base does not come off. I almost hit my son's head on the roof everytime I lift him to put him in the car. (The Alpha Omega, without the base, puts everything at a better angle.) What I really don't understand is with all this technology...why can't they make a car seat that is comfortable and works like they say it will! They all seem to have their ""issues."" Good luck!"
4,2 small problems,"I just purchased this seat this past weekend and so far it seems to be ok except sometimes when my 5 month old son falls alseep his head hangs foward and this is on the fully reclined position rear facing. I guess I will need to install those foam cylinders from the police dept to make it sit a little more back. Also the other day I was turning the yellow knob to release the belt and it seemed to be stuck from the one side but it hasn't happened since. I'll just have to wait and see. This is a good seat when my son is awake, it appears to be comfortable."
2,Black leather on a baby seat?!?!,"While I found this car seat to be well-made and easy to use, I have to question the intelligence of whomever decided that it would be a good idea to put black leather on a baby seat. It will become very hot on sunny days and burn the baby. The instruction manual warns that this will happen and suggests putting a blanket over the seat on sunny days when not in use. That's fine, but what about when it is in use? An hour long trip on a sunny day and my baby is going to burn his legs. I am going to return this seat and try to find the regular Evenflow Triumph model, which I do not think has the leather on it."
3,Cannot ajdust straps!,"This is a great seat except for one thing...in our car and a couple of others I've put it in, you cannot turn the ""convenient"" dial used to tighten the shoulder straps because it is so tight against the back of the seat. If the your back seat reclines it makes it easier because you can recline it, turn the dial, and pull the seat back upright."
2,Go with the Britax,"My husband and I both have Britax car seats in our vehicles. We recommended this seat to our mothers who also like to transport our child. Since this one was highly rated for safety and cost less than the Britax seats, we figured this would make a good ""grandma"" car seat. We are not pleased with this car seat. The straps get twisted often. It is not as comfy looking as the Britax seats. It sits up too straight. It is extremely wide. If you're looking for the top seat for safety, comfort, and ease of use, this is not the seat to buy. Spend a little more. Go with the Britax. You won't regret it!"
2,REALLY NOISY,"I bought this because it looked very comfortable for my 10 month old and loved the colors, but as soon as we put it in the Sequioa it was rattleing whenever i drove, so I returned it the next day"
4,where's the manual???,"i just bought this car seat and i like it so far but i had to figure everything out for myself. so i'm not even 100% sure if i did everything right. no, it's not in that back panel. ehhh... what's up with that? can anybody tell me where else i can get the manual for this?? i already tried the evenflo website..."
4,Bought 2 and Will Buy 2 More!,"After a lot of research on convertible car seats, I was deciding between the Britax and this car seat. I have twins and will be eventually getting 4 car seats, so price was a major factor. I decided on the Evenflo Triumph DLX and I have to say I love it! I've read a lot of reviews on these that say that they are hard to install, difficult to move the straps to a different position and difficult to release. I found that the installation took 10 minutes to get it tight in both my Acura and my husbands Tahoe. The straps are easily moved without removing the car seat by detaching the cover and lifting a panel. The harness release takes some getting used to after using Graco Snugride seats, but after a few times it's apiece if cake! My son that is using this seat also loves it! He falls asleep rapidly and can see out the window more easily. Like the title says, I bought 2 and will shortly be being 2 more!!"
2,too small,"This seat worked fine until my daughter got close to 30 pounds. Now the straps are too short and I'm shopping for a new seat. I took to bottom off to check that I was really at the end of the straps, and I am.The knob mechanism is a poorer design than the standard strap mechanism for tightening and loosening the straps. The latch system is nice, but all seats have that now."
2,Comfy but straps are VERY HARD to adjust,"I bought this car seat for our 2 month old as she HATED the Graco SnugRide and we needed something more comfortable for her to ride in. This seat worked wonders. She loved it. It is very comfy and roomy. However, the straps are impossible to adjust rear facing. I had to remove the seat from the car just to loosen them. What a Pain!!!!!!!!!! Now that my daughter is 15 months, I am not that impressed with the straps as they have one height adjustment for forward facing and it seems too high and rubs against her neck. I bought this seat because it is highly rated. However, I would buy the Britax seat over this one again as we bought the Marathon for my two year. It is extremely easy to use and not that much hassle."
3,Having Problems!!,"We purchased the Evenflo Triumph DLX for our 9 month old daughter on Wed. Today, Sat, I am ready to throw the thing out the window! I can't get the release knob to move no matter what I do. I don't know if I'm doing something wrong, but I practically break my thumb trying to get the stupid thing to move. I could feel the vertebrae in my back moving, I was exerting that much pressure on the knob.The seat is fine otherwise. It fits great in our 2005 Honda Odyssey, our daughter seems to enjoy sitting & driving in it, but I have such a difficult time getting her out.I'll be emailing Evenflo as well to see how to fix this problem, but am seriously considering returning this seat & buying the Britax. It's not worth the aggravation & time that I've already wasted trying to get my poor baby out of the car!"
3,Jill,"I bought this car seat for my daughter long ago and have loved it. However, now she is 22 months and 27 pounds and the straps are getting too tight already. When I called the company they said I needed to take it apart and measure the straps because they can get stuck. I was disapointed that I would be having these issues with a car seat less than 18 months old. I got no indication that the car seat would be replaced fo me, so it looks like I may have to by another one already."
4,Puzzled?,"Just purchased this seat this weekend after reading all the reviews and then trying in the store. Love it so far but noticed that when my wee girl fell asleep today in it her head was slumped forward not very comfortable looking. She is 7 months old and obviously rear facing, I am doing something wrong??"
2,too many screws,"I decided against this car seat for 2 main reasons: to adjust the straps or clean the cover, you would have to remove the back cover which includes about 8 screws and I could not loosen the straps easily. Another reason (although not a main one) is the seat is heavy. It's cumbersome if you are frequently taking the seat out to move from one car to another or drop off with the day care. I bought the Graco ComfortSport instead (saved me about $20 and weighs less than 12 pounds)."
2,Straps are bad,"This seat is absolutely impossible to adjust. The straps, like so many others have mentioned, cannot be moved without a tremendous amount of force. We bought this seat, tried it out for a few hours, and ended up returning it the same day because it wasn't workable. Perhaps the straps loosen in time and perhaps this is a great seat in the long run; however if you want something that you can get your child in and out of easily this is not the seat for you."
2,If your child is over 2 this carseat is not for u,I just got this carseat yesterday I was very exited about it but when it was time to sit my son who just turned 2 last month in it the straps where pulled as much as they could go and my son would not fit. eventhough the seat says toddlers up to 40 lb and 40 in but my son is only 30 pounds and not close to 40 inches in height it is probably great for infants but not for young toddlers.
5,Great car seat,I purchased this for my 3 month old daughter and am very pleased with it. The adjustments are easy to make and it seems comfortable for her. It's nicely padded and it is very well made. She should get a lot of use from it. The only drawback is that it doesn't fit in my Camaro very well in a rear facing position but neither does any other model. It will fit much better once she can face forward. It does however work very well in our Explorer.
4,Almost Perfect,I love this car seat. We shopped around a lot and did research on the safest seats. It's easy to install and the adjustmests for the straps are great.My only gripe is the black fabric on the arms of the seat get VERY HOT in the sun. Before I put my daughter in the seat (on a sunny day) I have to cool it down by just running my hands over it -- or sometimes I drape a blanket over the whole seat when I know I'll come back to a hot car.
1,Watch Out - crotch strap came completely out!,"I bought this seat 8 months ago when my son outgrew his infant seat. We looked at the Britax and some others and after discussing this and reading all the reviews, I thought this seemed great. It was, except for how wide it was, but even that is acceptable.What is completely unacceptable -- while trying to put son in the seat, pull up the crotch strap -- it came completely out of the seat!! We had to work to get it back in and secure to get him home. Now it moves back and forth and twists. How horrible that the strap came completely out and this is supposed to save my child in an accident!!The warranty is only for 90 days. I went and bought the Britax yesterday and it is much easier to use (lighter, easier to adjust straps). Plus they have a 1 yr warranty.I just can't believe it came out and it scares me to think what could have happened!"
2,Inconvenient to use - strap problems,"I just returned this seat because I found it too inconvenient to use. The straps were constantly getting twisted and the mechanism for tightening and loosening the straps was awful to use... it would seem to freeze in place so that no amount of human strenghth could release it. On the plus side, it did seem comfortable for the baby, although she did get overheated in it rather easily."
1,Please read this before buying.......,"In two months this is my second Triumph seat. The first one was missing parts although it was fresh out of the sealed box. Today i had to unscrew the back of the seat to get the seat cover off to wash it, the special impact resistant foam was completly split in half. There is no way that my 8th month old did that one. Also the straps are very difficult, and have fun actually getting the seat into your car rear facing without having the ""latch"" system. I will tell you however that as far as comfort goes, it seems great, but with all of the other quirks it has, it's really not worth it. Sorry Triuph, 2 strikes and your out. I am going to just break down and buy the Britax."
1,Strapes,"I heard good things on this car seat. We had it for a couple months then I tried to move the strape in the crouch area and in moved down inside the seat. Now it is stuck and will not pull out totally. I can not put my child in it with out it being VERY tight and he is VERY uncomfortable. I went to Baby R US and and showed them what I did and there car seat did the same thing. They worked on it for a hour. We tried to call EvenFLO and there customer service hours are only till 4 pm central time (M- F)so it was hard to get a hold of them cause I have to work. They would not state that this happens all the time. They stated to try and get it out with a screw driver and if that does not work, IT CAN NOT BE FIXED. But they stated they would give me a new one or give me a different on. If I had them give me the same one they would not give me another one if the same thing happen again. Watch the strapes."
2,Royal Pain!,"I heard good things about this carseat but was very disappointed when I bought two for our twin boys. The straps get twisted (within the first three days) and it is very difficult to get around the shoulders. My husband was extremely frustrated and was at wits end with the chairs. Also, the turn dial on the side which tightens the straps was broken so I had to reach around a squirmy child and use both dials - not easy! I am taking them both back and buying the Britax. It is not worth the money to be irritated for the next two years."
3,"Okay carseat, but I expected better","This carseat is nice to look at and has some nice features, however, it does not lay back far enough. Everytime my 6 month old (weighs 21 lbs)goes to sleep in the seat his head falls forward to the point when I stop his head is practically in his lap. Even when he isn't sleeping, he looks slumped over. I even took the removable padding out hoping it would help but it didn't. For the price I paid, I'm not very happy. I'm just hoping as he gets a little older, it will work better for us."
4,Nice Functionality,I have 2 of these car seats for my daughter for our 2 cars and have been using them for almost 4 years and it's so easy to put my child in and out of this car seat. It is also very sturdy.
2,Thought I would Love It,"I did so much research before I bought my daughter a new carseat once she outgrew her infant carrier, and I finally decided on this one. After having it for 2 months I hate it. The straps ARE a pain in the butt to adjust, with the two straps combined, it is hard to get them to fit right. The way the carseat sits in my Grand Prix, and our Sierra Truck is not as I thought it would, I actually turned our baby front facing before she was one year, because it does not sit right in our two vehicles. The padding that is additinal always slumps down in the seat making it hard to adjust the straps correctly. The knobs on the side to adjust are a true pain, they are hard to adjust at first because they are stiff, even after they are broke in, they are still not convient."
1,Can't use over 25lbs in winter!!,"We read Consumer Reports and decided on this carseat due to their rating...however....the car seat no longer fits our child and she is 26lbs! She is tall for her age but that's not the problem. Putting a winter coat on her and then strapping her in is not possible. After re-reading the directions, it states not to put a child in ""bulky clothing"". After calling the company, they re-confirmed this. I replied, ""You expect us to put her in a coat, take her to the car, take off the coat, drive, then put in the coat again in 20 degree weather??"" Their reply, ""yes ma'am"". Don't bother with this carseat..."
1,DANGEROUS !!!!! DO NOT BUY !!!!!,"I bought this car seat for my son when he was 4 months old and everything was fine until he turned 8 months. As I was getting my son out of the car one day, I noticed he had a handful of white styrofoam. He was able to lift up the car seat cover just a little bit and picked the styrofoam on both sides. I'm trying to get this car seat recalled, as it could be a choking hazard and possibly kill a child. PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS SEAT !!!"
3,Good for little ones,I loved this car seat until now ... it was easy to install easy to loosen and tighten the straps... But now my daughter is 19 months and 28 lb and the straps don't fit her anymore. They say good up to 40 lb I don't think so!! I think I should have bought one that was less money... I could have used it longer ... now I have to buy a new car seat because she's too small for the boster seats.
2,I HATE this seat!,"I also did a lot of research before buying this seat. We took our baby to the Babies-R-Us store and placed her inside the display seat to see how she fit and how easy it was to adjust the straps. Well the seat works fine when the baby is little, less than a year. After that the seat is a pain. The back of the carseat must be disassembled with tools to re-tread the straps through a higher shoulder slot. My baby threw-up in the seat and I had to take the whole thing apart to remove the cover and straps to wash them. Also, no matter how I work the knobs, the straps have always been too tight on my daughters shoulders after I put them through the higher slots. The seat is wide and doesn't fit in every position in our minivan. I had hoped to use this carseat for a few years, but now I can't wait to replace it! Our next seat will be a Britax that adjusts up to 65 lbs."
5,Great Car Seat,This is a great car seat. I've had this seat for over one year and it's still holding up. The only problem I have is finding a replacement seat cover (after all the food and juice stains).
5,The BEST carseat you can buy!,"I love the Evenflo Triumph carseat. I purchased it initially, 3 1/2 years ago, because it had the highest safety test rating from Consumer Reports, and safety is my first priority. I now own 4 of them, and all of my kids (ages 4, 2 1/2, and 1 1/2) ride in one. My 4 yr old is 35 lbs and 39"" tall, so he is almost outgrowing his, but he still fits fine, even with his winter jacket on. The tightness of the straps is VERY easy to adjust, and the position of the straps is too. This is the only carseat that I have found where you can adjust the position of the straps form the front of the seat without even having to take it out of the car. I have never had any of the problems that other people have stated - no twisted straps, straps being too short, etc... I feel that my children are very secure and safe in their seats and I will purchase them in the future if I have more kids. I highly recommend this seat, and I'm sure you will be very happy with it too!"
5,Wonderful!,"I research EVERYTHING before buying anything and I especially researched car seats. This is the absolute best car seat on the market. It is very easy to install properly, has a very convenient strap adjustment knob on both sides, a five point harness system, an option to recline (if under a year old), and metal seat buckles instead of plastic. It even has the LATCH system for newer cars. Although it is wider than most car seats, this is absolutely not a problem. We have a two door Chevy Cavalier and it fits nicely in the middle of our back seat and two other people can sit in the back as well. This is a great car seat!"
3,More add-on than intro,Moderately compelling art-pop is too short to startle but does provide occasional uplift.
3,Cover artwork is misleading...,"A series of personnel changes led to the line-up documented on this album, featuring drummer Stewart Copeland, who would later become a member of The Police. However, the musicianship is loose and unfocused and the music of ""Midnight wire"" hardly goes beyond mainstream jazz-rock. Curved Air show only little effort, and the lyrics were done by a ghostwriter. Yes, the music isn't as fiery as the cover artwork might indicate. It shows a burning pharao snake, this is a kind of firecracker leaving behind a voluminous black ash. There are some enjoyable songs though, ""Woman on.."" with some old-style rock piano, the moody ""Pipe of dreams"" and the up-tempo ""Orange street blues"". The rest is lightweight and doesn't leave a lasting impression. It's as nice album, but not Curved Air's best and not one of my favourites."
4,TD Flat Earth,"Loved this CD and listen to it frequently still. It's more of a serious introspective from Mr. Dolby...so if you know him by ""Blinded Me With Science"" only, you won't find that quirkiness on this CD."
4,A Very Good Follow Up,"Thomas Dolby continued his trend of making very good songs on this (rather short) album. ""Hyperactive"" is loud and fun, but rather out of place on the album. The rest of the album drifts along rather nicely. ""White City"" doesn't quite work, but the rest of the album is quite good."
1,hahahah,"ok so let me start out, i was sopposed to get a white one. i got a cream color one with stains all over it"
2,shinking,"I liked the hat when it first came, looked very good and fit well (I wear my beanie jutting out at the back).But it being white it got a bit dirty, so I threw it in the washwhen it came out it had shrunk to about 1/3 of the original size"
3,not bad,"I am an electrician, and have generally used a makita 1/2"" drill for all my frame drilling. I purchased the bosch 18v brute and have been doing a lot of reno's recently. Drill has enough torque to blow through several side by side 2xwhatever, but the torque settings occassionaly get nudged because they are close to where you grad the drill, same with the forward/reverse. Also a little wobble on the chuck, not sure if this was factory or developed since I used it, but it does concern me. And I have a new duplex coming up, and want to give the cordless a try to drill out the entire thing, more to come on that. I like the rubber grips, and after several uses the battery seems to hold for some decent workload. Havent given much of a run on the hammer drill with it, what I have done, it seems fine, just 3/16 and 1/4 stuff."
4,Magic Time opened my eyes,"I met Doug Marlette while visiting Texas at a book signing. He is nice person with an open mind. He also is an engaging speaker. I enjoyed him very much, so I bought his book Magic Time for my husband and I to read. My husband reads highly reviewed books every chance he gets, and thought this was a very good book. Big compliment for him, and intends to buy Doug Marlettes other book: the Bridge. This book was important for me to read. Some of it was hard to get through, because I don't like violence, but upon the conclusion I was left with a deeper understanding of the civil rights movement and the sacrifices made. Magic Time is a book that discribes turbulant times in the South, but you meet characters who are good people and take big risks to made a difference. It is subject that has been greatly ignored, but needs to be discussed. That is why I reccomend that you read it."
3,Not so magic,"I really liked The Bridge so was looking forward to reading this. But found myself a bit disappointed. It just didn't't flow as well for me as Marlette's first novel did. The characters bunched up and were hard for me to keep straight, and I was not as convinced of them as I was in The Bridge. I put it aside, thinking it might be my mood, but even when I came back, was just not carried into the novel. (Which is a shame, because it is a fascinating period of our history, and one which needs to be explored more. The subject was not what put me off me off on the book."
5,Great,"They came, they work, they're not cheap and breakable. I like them, and I would order them again if needed."
5,All natural gourmet dog treats,Doggie De Lites all natural gourmet dog treats. The boys loved them and had a great time with the Frisbee too. Two treats in one package. Makes a great gift too.
5,Iron Mike is God!,"Bar none, this is the greatest book I have ever read. Iron Mike is cooler than Shakespeare and more handsome than J.D. Salinger. Battery Acid's been in my bathroom since I bought it and it actually makes me look forward to going in there. If I have one word of advice, I would say buy this book."
2,Poor workmanship,"Appearance excellent, but on close examination the foot of the pillars had scratches on them which looked bad. Unless this glass table is hidden behind something, I would not want these problems to be seen. Otherwise the unit was very heavy and could easily hold the weight of my 54"" Plazma TV. This may have been a one time quality control problem, but given the weight and time to assemble, I did not want to gamble on a replacement and therefore returned it. As always, Amazon's guaranty is the best should you have a problem."
4,Serves its purpose,"This probably isn't the greatest knife sharpener in the world, but it serves it's purpose and my knives are very sharp at the moment.Overall pleased and would recommend to anyone looking for a low cost solution to the dull knife epidemic :)"
3,As advertised... BUT....,"I don't care for this product. It easily slides around on most smooth surfaces; not good when working with sharp objects. Cumbersome. Cuts very roughly. Difficult to use with bulky or awkward tools like axes and hatchets. Would probably work ok for dressing up kitchen knives if the stones were finer. While it works as designed, to a degree, there are better products out there."
2,hard to sharpen with it,"I brought this sharpener and I recently sharpened my Cold Steel Trail Boss with it and it takes like 20 minutes to sharpen it, it wears my arm down after a couple of minutes, and the sharpener is already wearing down! I'm planning next week to get the Fiskars Hatchet, the Fiskars Splitting Axe, and I'm also planning to get a Granfors Bruks Sharpener to replace this one.P.S. The reason I gave this sharpener 2 stars instead of 1 is because at least it made the axe sharp again."
3,Works okay,"Not as sturdy as I would have imagined, but it works pretty well, for the price. I would recommend this product."
2,Not the best Money I've spent,This Fiskars Axe or Knife sharpener is a lame product. Not very accurate or true to sharpening an edge on a knife or axe. Not sure how it passes as a sharpener????
3,Okay,"It gets the job done but it probably won't last very long, the plastic that it is made of looks like it will break easily."
3,Works...,This works to sharpen the axe quite well...however that plastic opening is just slightly to small and will occasionally catch the axe and not allow me to slide it through smoothly. I find myself lifting the plastic cover off to make it easier to use.
3,Works just fine,"Works as designed, very cheaply built though, plastic you know surrounding the stones for sharpening, time will tell if it holds up to make it worth while purchase."
3,Adequate,"It works, have sharpened several knives. It is a cheap product which results in the rating. Can not say more."
2,AXE Sharpener--NOT!!,"This sharpens my hatchet just fine, but I have a small ""boy's axe"" about the size of a ""camp axe"". The axe blade is too wide to fit into the sharpener. It's great for knives and hatchets, but any kind of axe...not so much!"
1,Not an axe sharpener,"This product is not an axe sharpener. My axe blade only fits halfway into the ""V"" groove, which is too narrow and does not allow the blade to contact the sharpening stones. This product is obviously made to sharpen knives, but not axes.It you are looking for an axe sharpener, keep on looking because this product is not for you."
1,Awful,"Flimsy. Could not get an edge on my new machete using this. Barley got an edge on my hand axe. Could not get an edge on my Shrade Hunting knife. Cheap, lightweight, poor excuse for a sharpened. Price is much too high for what you get"
3,Simple to use but cheaply built,"Bought with a Fiskar X27 splitting axe. Simple, easy to use and effective in sharpening the axe.But the sharpening portion of the tool is covered by a flimsy piece of plastic that easily comes off. I just have to snap it back in place, knowing it will come off again after I sharpen my (quite large I must admit) splitting axe."
3,Not what expected,"I have the 14 inch x7 fiskars hachet. This product didn't preform as well for me compared to other excellent reviews this product got. Maybe I will give it another go. It is light weight and seems simple enough to use but when I go to sharpend my hachet it seems as if it is scratching up the edge and not leaving it very sharp at all. On the contrary my lanksy's dual grit sharpener I ordered with this Item works wonderfully, I sharpened my hachet up and it tackles bigger jobs then it is even intended for. Recently cut down a roughly 6 inch in diamiter green tree. Took a little while but worked great. The hachet is a great product for delimbing trees and cuts straight through 2 inch branches."
2,farmer,"This item was surprisingly cheesy and wimpy , it sharpens nothing ,waste of money it would be categorized the same as a child s toy. Not usual for a Fiskars product."
1,pure junk!,"This sounded like a good thing, but it just falls apart. I was sharpening a cutlass, but it's now in the garbage. It might work for knives, but nothing heavier."
1,waste of money,dont waste your time or money still looking for a great sharpener. Now trying the sog but not sure of that either
3,not what I expected,"the plastic holder seems very flimsy, while it does fit the axe well, I don't think it sharpen the saw very much as I couldn't put much force on it."
5,Convenience for home,"I bought this thinking I could save some time and sharpen my knives and axes ""the easy way"". Lesson learned that there are no shortcuts. The sharpener put a slight edge on my pocket knife, but did very little for my estwing camping axe. It is a fairly cheap plastic case with ceramic wheel inside."
1,Pure trash!,"Cheap Plastic. Don't bother. Why sellers stake their reputation on such garbage, I don't know. If you need to sharpen a working tool buy another product."
2,Not good,"I thought it would sharpen. I will not buy this product again, I bought it cause of the ax and hatchet would need sharpening, but it is not worth what I paid."
3,Not bad at all.,"It works very well for the first couple of weeks. After five weeks or so it dulls out. Also, when you are sharpening your tool it will cut into the plastic every time. That's about the only problem I have had with it, other than that it works well for a month or so."
4,Works pretty good,I use this with a Fiskars hatchet. It's pretty fool-proof. Just swipe the blade through it several times. It removed a rough spot on the blade and made it noticeably sharper. It seems a little cheapish in the plastic housing. But it does work. There's no way to adjust the angle.
2,Not as good as I hoped.,"This sharpener is more frustrating than helpful. It worked okay on my kitchen knives but when I tried to sharpen my machete ,no go. My regular pocket knives ended up being bill instead of sharpened, not worth my time or money. I bought sharpening stones after this and everything is now sharp... I would say go for sharpening stones."
4,so far so good,This little gizmo works fairly well for my Fiskar axe. Just a few swipes touches up the edge nicely. I think if you have a decent edge going it will help maintain it but not much use if you have more than just a light touch-up job to do.
4,nice little system,i like it there are obviously better sharpening choices but for the price and the fact that you dont need any real knowledge of sharpening to use this thing its really nice to have around it put a nice edge on my axe blade so im happy with it.
1,Works poorly.,"I bought this to use with an axe that I dulled chopping roots.There are a number of problems with this product. Firstly, it's too lightweight, so it doesn't feel very stable. Secondly, the opening for the axe blade is too narrow, I imagine a lot of axes simply wouldn't fit. And thirdly, it doesn't seem to do much. There is no feeling of positive contact between the abrasive and the edge of the axe. It just seems to roll back and forth without sharpening anything.Perhaps it would be OK for touching up a blade that is already sharpened, but for my dull axe, it isn't helping."
4,Gets the job done,"For someone looking to get a quick edge on a blade, this product does what it needs to do. Easy to use and easy to store in the kitchen for quick use."
2,Only good for Knifes,"The sharpener is only good for knifes. Although it gets 5 stars as a knife sharpener, it don't get any stars for axe sharpening. The reason is the plastic notch is too narrow for an axe blade to slide through. Too bad I purchased this for my axe :("
5,Great all-purpose sharpener,"This item is terrific. It does a good job sharpening everything, from axes on down to knives."
2,Not impressed,"I got it to use on an estwing axe, and it doesnt work very well. I ended up using a file and stone."
1,I don't get it,"For the life of me, I could not figure out how to use this thing. I do a better job sharpening my knives and axes with a bastard file followed by a whetstone. I just dragged the blade of my axe through this thing over and over, and nothing happened."
1,Skip purchasing this tool,"I purchased this sharpener along with a Fiskars Brush Axe. The Brush Axe arrived without a sharp edge and this sharpener wiped out its two sharpening stones in about 10 seconds of attempted use. Needless to say, I was left with the dull sensation that I'd been taken and I would not buy this sharpener again. FWIW, a ten-dollar, old-style, safety sharpener worked like a charm to sharpen up my new Fiskars Brush Axe."
3,Sharpness for knives.... eh kinda,Check out the sports & outdoors section at a Megamart for one of those $3 two-slot knife sharpeners for a better edge on a blade.
1,pure junk,"I have purchased a few sharpeners over the years. This is by far the worse one. The plastic case it is made of gets cut up real fast the first time used. The rolling sharpening wheel does not sharpen. If anything, it dulls your blade as the blade rolls on it. Junk, junk, junk, junk and junk. Very unhappy."
2,Don't waste your time,"I bought this thinking I could save some time and sharpen my knives and axes ""the easy way"". Lesson learned that there are no shortcuts. The sharpener put a slight edge on my pocket knife, but did very little for my estwing camping axe. It is a fairly cheap plastic case with ceramic wheel inside. It was not expensive however neither is a wet stone. There is no substitute for learning to sharpen your knives/tools with an old fashion wet stone. I generally do not rate items, but feel compelled to say that I would not recommend this."
3,A good value at the price ... kind of cheap.,"This will do a good job of maintaining an edge on a knife or hatchet. It is made out of plastic and feels ""cheap"". But it made a good edge on most blades I've run through it. Also did good with my hiking hatchet. I'm interested in seeing how long it will last."
4,takes a little work,"You use a back and forth motion to sharpen the hatchet or ax, not a pull through.I used a very dull hatchet that's used to split kindling wood, mainly 2x4 pieces.It takes a lot, I mean, a lot of back and forth pulls but, you know what, my little hatchet started to develop an edge and was getting sharp.I'll get back to it when I need to split more kindling and run the hatchet through a couple of dozen more times.The more you run your az et al through the sharpener, the more it works for you. No need to worry about shaving off too much metal from a hatchet.I would not use this sharpened for my kitchen knives, though. But I would use it for a cheap camping or outdoor knife that would get sharp with a crude edge."
3,Good and bad,Great for axes and for a cheap knife but nearly ruined a benchmade. I got the benchmade back by buying a wusthof sharpener that brought it back to shaving sharpness. I love it for axes and other big blades that have a lot of cheap steel to chip away at but I wouldn't use this for a good knife.
5,WORKS GREAT!,"I BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT FOR USE WITH THE GERBER EXTRA-LARGE AXE. IT WORKS AMAZINGLY WELL, THE AXE CAME RELATIVLY SHARP, BUT AFTER A FEW PASSES ON THE SHARPENER IT LITERALY SHAVED THE HAIR ON MY ARM! IT HAS A LITTLE FLIP UP LID SO YOU CAN CLEAN THE SHARPENING BLADES/REPLACE THEM. THIS PODUCT ALSO WORKED REALLY WELL ON MY LEGITIMUS COLLINS & CO. 1945 MACHETE.(best mahete ever made) I HAVENT USED THIS PRODUCT ON ANY OF MY KNIVES(AND I WON'T) BECAUSE I ONLY USE A WUSTHOF CERAMIC SHARPENER FOLLOWED BY A NICE LEATHER STROP AND DONT WANT TO CHANCE A NEW BLADE ANGLE, ON ANY OF MY BABIES. I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANYONE WHO DEMANDS A QUALITY EDGE ON ANY OF THE ABOVE MENTIONED PRODUCTS. AXES, MACHETES,"
1,Broke too fast,"The plastic handle, the elongated piece you hold onto, broke with very little use. I was not impressed with this."
4,Fiskars axe sharpener,I ordered the Fiskars axe sharpener with a new Fiskars axe. The sharpener works well and puts a keen edge on the axe blade.Just run the axe blade edge through the sharpener a 3-4 times and the blade is very sharp. I do not know how many times the sharpener can be used to touch up the edge be fore a major sharpening is needed.
5,Author keeps History in mind,"I skimmed this book for background information, and was impressed that Magner's did not interpret and judge ancient history on a modern science basis, but rather presented and evaluated each scientist as he dealt with the information he had, answering the questions presented to him by the culture in which he lived. Magner also did very well explaining scientific ideas to me -- a somewhat scientifically educated, but non-science major."
3,"Two down, dozens to go.","Someone recommended this book to me. I have decided to go through the recipes one by one. I have only made two so far, with mixed reviews. First muffin was a lemon tea muffin and it was way too salty for me and my family. I questioned myself as I was adding the teaspoon that was called for, but I wanted to follow the recipe exactly. Yuck. Second up was an apple muffin. It had a very good flavor, but looked awful. It was hard for me to get anyone in the family to try one because their appearance was so bad. I will continue to try the recipes because they are generally easy and only make 8-10 muffins. Surely I will eventually find a hit."
1,Not the best by Reeves and Mortimer,"I picked this up because I LOVE every thing else that Reeves and Mortimer have ever done, (especially Catterick). This, however, has none of the absurd and surreal humor that I need. I watched the first few episodes, and I can say for certain that I was not entertained in the least. I do not doubt that if I were a brit, (I am american), this would speak to me on some level; but as things are, I fail to see any value in Randall and Hopkirk (Deceased)."
1,not very useful,I ended up giving this book away - I did not find it very useful - information disorganized and most of it available on the internet for free.
2,Healing your Body A-Z,"I like the book well enough, but it has columns which made it difficult to read. The words became jumbled and it was distressing. From A-Z is in three columns and even reading sideways, it was not easy to make out the words. It should not be on the Kindle. The subject however was worthwhile. Reading books without columns has always been a pleasure.Amelia B"
3,A little repetitious,"interesting book. Though I am interested in the premise, this book lists all the possible places in one's body that could cause problems or illnesses with the underlying emotions that may have caused it. The problem is that the same emotions are repeated over and over again with each possible problem spot. And the affirmations to counteract those emotions are also a bit vague and repetitious."
3,Dissappointing,"This book is nicely packaged, and if you dont have the book, This ""you can heal your life"", buy it! but the packaging ""tricked"" me into buying something I already had!"
3,emotional counseling,"Some of the healing thoughts make sense ,some don't.If you have an illness and you are looking for positive ways of finding comforts for healing it can help a little bit.Cheaper than going to a therapist especially when you think of al the scheduling and driving and inusrance battles."
1,Not helpful,"This book totally disappointed me. Let me give you an example of what you'll find inside; if you have hemorroids, you are ""holding onto things"" and then there's a suggestion on how to let go of things. If you have acne, you have anger inside, etc. There is no science behind any of this. I agree that your feelings can contribute to health issues but it's not the entire cause. Maybe I just have big pores in my skin that clog easy. There's maybe 5% truth to this book but that's about it."
2,Not what I thought it was,A person recommended this book but it was not what I thought it was going to be but I have to say I have laughed more than I have in a very long time so I guess I got something out of the book.
1,A Silly Little Book,"This is a cute, but silly little book and is not worth the paper it is printed on. It is very superficial, and way over-rated. It is fodder for wishful thinkers, and not seriously helpful."
2,INSIGHTFUL,"Have always appreciated Louis Hay's depth and breadth of insight.This small book is just an alphabetical look-see at why we're sometimes facing the problems we are. Gr8 for shining light on our own foibles and dilemmas. Thanks you, Ms. Hay, wherever you are."
5,Heal Your Body,"This book is so easy to use and helps you to get to the root of any condition. I have successfully resolved many physical pain and freed myself of the mental conditions. I use the affirmations in the book every day. I am more calm, peaceful and happy thanks to this book. Your body is talking to you....stop and listen!"
4,A Handy Guide,"This book is a handy little guide to have around...whenever a family member, or I, have a new ache, or strange sensation in a body part, we look it up! Sure enough, what is going on in our thoughts and emotions matches the explanation. And, the positive affirmation helps to clear it. Mind, body, spirit - it's all connected."
3,It's a little repetitive,"A lot of the illnesses have the same emotional causes, and some of them are down right laughable. The message is the same as with most self-help books. It's the power of positive thinking."
4,Heal body to your soul,This book is a good awakening for everybody who lives in the world and don't know how to appreciates himself/ herself.
3,Heal Your Body A-Z By Louise Hay,Louise Hay explores the importance of spiritual wellness to our body's health. She lists many common ailments and a possible metaphysical link to their occurrence in patients. Some of her explanations seem surprisingly accurate. She also gives positive new thought patterns to repeat daily during the healing process. It makes me want to become more familiar with Louise Hay and her work. I believe there is a great deal of similarity between she and Edgar Cayce.
3,May help some people,"Like Elder's first study guide, whether this will help you or not depends on your learning style. If you don't trust that you know something until you've taken a test, this book can help. It does an excellent job of pulling out the key topics and quizzing you on them. There are no 'silly' questions here--only the important stuff. On the other hand, if you like to read and underline, then return to the text when you are actually 'doing' the activity, then this book is probably a waste of money. One nit complaint: some of the labeling of chart features is a bit unclear. Since it is sometimes tough to tell which letter goes with which feature, answering some questions is difficult, even when you know the material."
5,Excellent!,"As a new stock market investor, this book is a great companion to the ""Come into my trading room"" book."
3,Cheap blades,These blades fit fine on the mower. However they're only about half the thickness of the original blades. They seem to work ok and will as long as the ground remains flat. Once uneven ground is encountered I'm afraid they will easily bend. However Amazon is always a good deal compared to retail prices!
1,Cheap lawn mower blade,Was not worth the money. Blade bent for apparently no real good reason. I pushed the lawn tractor out of the way to make sure I did not hit anything which I did not. There was no evidence of any impact to the blade itself. I was mowing in a bit of a sandy area and apparently the sand heated the blade and it simply bent downward and plowed into the ground. I have never had a blade do that. So don't waste your money like I did.
1,Not a genunine Tripp Lite product,"The cable is not genuine Tripp Lite. It is poorly made and does not have the metal clips like a genuine one should. Some other reviews have reported similar. You can see a pic of a genuine one at at the Tripp Lite site. The cables I received were branded ""Comax"".Amazon issued me a refund.Update: May 12, 2012: Amazon claimed they were going to resolve it so I ordered again and received another non-Tripp Lite cable. The cable I received is like the orange one that I show in my ""Customer Images"". It is non-shielded and does not have the clips that a genuine Tripp Lite cable has.One more refund from amazon...."
5,Works and price was right,Attached it to my new hard drive and it works and the price was right. What more can you say.
5,SATA cable_ Tripp Lite??,"This cable does not have clips to lock the cable in place as indicated by other reviewers. The cable works as expected, does not have a ""sound quality"" attribute. It was not labeled as manufactured by ""Tripp Lite"" in the plastic bag it was shipped in. In fact, I doubt if Tripp Lite manufactured it. If they had, it would have been labeled as such. It does work fine, and is very low priced, compared to Radio Shack or Best Buy stores so I wouldn't pass it up because the brand is not on the unit. The ad should be corrected to indicate whether Tripp Lite did manufacture this cable however. The shipping costs more than the cable and should have been lower as this weighs only a few ounces at most. Charging $4.95 for shipping a cable in an envelope is way too much."
5,Best Of The Band MP3 Download,"Great music, if you were (or thought you were)cool in the 60's & 70's.Downloading MP3 is much easier & faster than ordering CD's.Listening to THE BEST OF THE BAND, takes me back to a much simpler and care free time."
3,Not as funny as the original,"I loved the original. After watching the original about 10 times, I decided to go out and buy the sequel on DVD. Like many sequels, it was not as funny as the original. The original's charm laid in its simplicity. Unfortunately, the success of the original allowed the makers of Friday to have a much bigger budget for the sequel, and this hurt the movie in many regards.Also, while Mike Epps is a funny man, this film severely misses Chris Tucker. It's hard not to think of Epps as a replacement to Tucker, and he doesn't live up to the standard Chris set in the original.It's a good movie, but don't go into it thinking it will be as funny as the first one."
2,I didn't like it!,"I don't know it was okay the first Friday was hilarious. This Friday did not have Chris Tucker in it and that's why I thought it wasn't that good. Usually, sequels aren't that great but it's good to look at the same cast who were back from the original and not a different cast like they do for made for TV movies."
1,"A Disasterous, Jumbled Mess Of A Movie","After the pure comedic brilliance of the first film ""Friday"", I was expecting the sequel to be just as entertaining, but not quite as funny without the presence of Chris Tucker.Unfortunately, ""Next Friday"" is neither funny nor entertaining.The writing is very uninspired and shows no creativity whatsoever. Which, of course, affected the performances. Ice Cube is downright dull and Micheal Epps totally lacks comedic timing and screen presence. Unlike Cube and Tucker in the original, Cube and Epps have no chemistry in this film. The jokes are stupid, senseless and are not funny. This movie is a downright disgrace and a complete disaster from beginning to end.This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Don't waste your money on this one. You'll be sorry."
2,The worst of the Friday series,"Next Friday wasn't as funny compared to the original cause there was no Smokey and the thugs in this movie weren't all that funny, the returning characters are Craig, Craig's Dad, Deebo and the next door neighbor Stanley (cameo).The story is about Craig's father taking Craig to Rancho Cucomonga to protect him from Deebo (who escaped from prison to get revenge). Deebo wasn't as good in this one compared to the original.Then Craig meets Uncle Elroy, who just won the lottery and his cousin Day Day (he's no sidekick compared to Smokey) and they meet the next door neighbor thugs.I only recommend this movie to the hardcore fans of Friday and I've seen Friday After Next and it's alot better than this one cause Day Day was actually funny in that one and the whole movie was funnier."
1,I think I laughed ONCE!,"This movie was terrible, I was definately dissapointed with the plot and the ending. The characters were dry and very corny. I would wait for this movie to come on regular TV, I wouldn't waste my money."
3,Ho-hum!,"I found this sequel to be a bit silly, rather than funny. Mike Epps IS a funny guy, but it wasn't enough to carry the movie. The perfect word for this one is:""corny""."
3,this movie was ok,"this movie could have been better. they should of made a better plot for this movie. it seem liked on some parts they tried to be so funny, that it wasn't funny."
3,Pretty funny stuff,"I liked this movie but it didn't have quite the kick like ""Friday"" did. I thought ""Friday"" was funnier because Chris Tucker was in it and pretty much made the movie. But this one has a lot of funny moments too. I especially liked the scenes with ""Cheeco"" the dog and ""the baby momma""."
4,"funny, but not as much as the first","I enjoyed this movie very much. It had drug humor and foul language, so its not for the little kiddies. It had a very little plot just like all comedies should be. You don't have to pay to much attention to it. All in all it was a very funny movie, but only worth a rental. Buy the first one instead."
2,This movie is no Boyz N Tha Hood,This is just and okay album Ice cube does a good performance but his cousin Dede and his white friend are not that good the plot is very thin but the Black Eugene Levy is in it and he is good.I will say it is some what decent.Story 2/10 Acting 4/10 Direction 2/10 Action 5/10 Entertainment7Overall=20/50 wich is a 40% no Boyz N Tha Hood 2 stars
2,disappointment,"I loved the original, but the sequel was a definite disappointment. There are some very funny parts, but those are grossly overshadowed by places where you can tell they were trying to funny, but you're not laughing. Mike Epps is a poor sidekick replacement for Chris Tucker."
1,nothing without tucker,this is alright but it could have been better if chris tucker came back without tucker this is nothing he made the movie funny sure ice cube is funny too but it's not the same the cousin is funny but not like tucker next friday has a few funny moments but nothing like the first one I hear they are working on a third one and they trying to get back chris tucker lets hope they do and lets hope it's much better.
2,can u please tell me what ive been watching for 90 minutes?,"this movie is very bad. i enjoyed the first friday to some degree, and was expecting a more comical sequel give the box office take of NEXT FRIDAY. what i got was more dirty jokes and stereotypes left and right, and not much of it was funny. a lot of the same topics are rehashed and beaten to death by the poor script and horrible acting. i chuckled maybe 4 or 5 times, and that was it in terms of comedic value. the film is confused, leaving the viewer even more confused."
4,NINO,"Although not as funny as the original Friday, I still found next Friday to be full of laughs. Between Day- Day and Sugar, they kept my checks hurting. I didn't see it in the movies, but its worth having at home to watch."
3,funnier than the first.....but not as cool as the first,"this movie was really not as good as the first.worth seeing once,but definetely needs Chris Tucker in it.a lot of people say Day-Day made up for Smokey but he didnt at all.i was expecting this movie to be hilarious but it was just plain funny."
5,best movie ive seen in years,this movie was hilarius.any people who like comedies should see this movie.
4,should have been the third film,"I enjoyed Ice Cube in this movie, but I think Day-day and uncle Elroy could have been funnier, Debo was the best part along with the new character sticky fingaz but wtf happened to Debo?"
1,Horrible,"This movie is an absolute mess.Not that I ever thought Cube had any talent to begin with, but when I found out he wrote this garbage, he sank deeper into the depths of misery. I was shocked an adult actually wrote this.How long can you sit through fart jokes until you've had enough? ""Too much hot sauce on the burrito"" followed by a fart effect. That's hilarious. That's all this movie is. It's not funny, it's not entertaining, and it certainly has no redeeming quality to it if you're older than six.Buy 'Problem Child 2'. It's the same exact thing, but at least the children can actually get away with reading those lines. They're better actors too.Don't buy this movie.The DVD offers a director and Ice Cube commentary that's actually funnier than anything in the film. In the beginning, Cube and Steve Carr actually state that they thought this was an innovative film. Now that's comedy!!"
2,The worst,this movie should no have been made because mike epps(day-day) i mean come on this dude should go back to comedy school.He can't top chris tucker thats fo sure.This movie lacked the prescence of chris tucker simply because the way craig and smokey interacted together it was chemistry.If they make another one hopefully chris is in it.
2,Hilarious,Ice Cube and Mike Epps are funny...Love the scene with Pinky....I can watch this everyday...And laugh like I never seen it before..
1,Wrong product received.,Full title of book was not represented on the web site. Book was part of a series and not the version we needed. We had to send back AT OUR EXPENSE.
4,Easy to Identify Birds,"Being from upstate New York, it is great having a sharp, clear, upclose picture of the birds native to this area without having to filter out the birds of other regions. The descriptions are easy to understand and makes for enjoyable reading. As an amateur bird watcher, I highly recommend this publication which has now become my #1 birding book."
4,Comlpine,The music so beautiful. Wonderful for listing to and very relaxing. I enjoy listing to chants and they are excellent as tme for quiet meditation. I usually play Compline as I fall as sleep at night...I just float away on the genle sounds.
3,Disappointed,"Just like anybody else, I bought this book to improve my newswriting skills.I was hoping for tips on how to write, but instead I got tips on how NOT to write.Great book if you want to read a bunch of poorly written scripts."
5,This is by far the most helpful book used in my preaching.,"I am, admittedly, a bit biased in the reviewing of this book, having been the first recipient of the original copy. However, I have found it to be immensely helpful for me in preparing for sermons, in the act of preaching, and in instructing others on the spiritual act of preaching. I would highly recommend it for anyone involved in any form of public speaking."
3,Helpyourselfish - just dig it!,"These guys are fantastic. You may very well argue whether this album is characteristic to the band - is it that essential, though?This a very well thought out (or rather felt) amalgamation of metal and 'country'. Well executed, indeed. One always wonders where the competition (stupid idea with respect of music) is. Nowhere near - I'd say. Is this worth it? I bet it is."
4,Very soft,"This is one of the better seatbelt covers I have purchased. Its thick and long, covering much of the shoulder/chest area. Product seems true to color and size depicted on the picture."
1,not enough pictures online before placing order,"the shoes have patterns on the ankle area that I did not see online when ordering. And those patterns totally ruined the shoes. if i had seen from pics online, i would have not bought this pair of shoes."
4,pretty cool looking,"they run slightly big, maybe a half-size, tops. but they have some cool looking features."
4,"More adventure in the Universe of the Four Gods, no da!","Miaka's quest continues in her search for the remaining warriors, as does her desire to be reunited with Tamahome, who still is waiting in Kutou with Yui, now the Priestess of Seiryu. Yui also loves Tamahome and refuses to give him up so easily, a fact which Nakago, the general of the Kutou army, uses to his advantage.Miaka faces challenges of bandits, zombies and spies at every turn, but her resolve to find all the warriors and return Tamahome to Konan does not shake. But when all seems successful, a new trial strikes at Miaka's very heart, one that she may not feel she can return from.Vol 3 includes episodes #14-20."
3,very rubbery,"Great looking and bat like feeling wings, nice weight not your usual plastic rubbish. but that is also its downfall the rubber smells really bad like walking around with a condom. If you leave it out for a few days the smell will eventually go."
5,I Don't Know Why I Waited So Long.,"For the longest time, I refused to buy into the hype and legend that surrounded this 1973 LP. Too much was written about it, the songs and their meanings were speculated and debated on by everyone I knew and the fact that it stayed on the Billboard Charts for a million years made it easy for me to dismiss it, after all, what do the masses know? But on Thanksgiving Day, just two weeks ago, I finally picked up a copy and gave it a listen, hmmm...relaxing, nice arrangements, excellent playing and great vocal harmonies throughout, not bad! ""Us & Them"" is my current fave and I now understand why so many millions have fallen under the spell of ""Darkside...."". The sounds and textures truly envelope and soothe you, creating a warm, calming effect that lingers long after the album ends. Roger Waters is one of the most underrated bassists in rock and his playing here ties everything together, truly unifying the disparate parts of this work. I'm a new convert."
5,An Iconic Album for any collection,"This album is an absolute must-have for any Pink Floyd fan, any rock fan, any music fan in general. The CD contains some of the greatest rock songs in history, and I'll never grow tired of it.Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, Jimi Hendrix... what do these three have in common? They're all icons.But Pink Floyd stands out."
3,A Production masterpiece only,"The album deserves to be lauded for it's innovative production, its breadth & sonic scope, and its thematic congruity. Truth be told it's an icy yet breathtaking listening experience. From a song by song basis however, it's not all first rate. 'Brain damage' is especially good, 'Breathe' is nice, 'Money' rocks as does 'Time' but some of the instrumentals don't quite measure up. 'Us and them' has a rousing move into the relative minor key (""...forward he cried..."" etc) which is actually very pedestrian and as a whole the album is produced to make the songs sound better than they really are. I think as far as 'soul' is concerned, Syd Barrett's 'The Madcap Laughs' is streets ahead. 'Dark Side of the Moon' is a good album; moreso, it's a masterful accomplishment in sound production."
2,UGH!,"Probably one of the most recognizable titles in the music industry.Too bad the only tune I consider passable is ""Money"". The rest of themusic on this CD stinks."
1,OH NO!,"Pink Floyd! Holy Christ, they're the worst band EVER! I mean EVER! OH MY GOD! GROTESQUE! THEY'RE HORRID! WOW! MAKE THEM DIE ALREADY! GO CREED! GO CREED! GO CREED!"
1,come on,"This cd is highly overrated. I guess that when it came out all stoners liked so ever since then it's popularity built up. The music is very slow and it makes you want to fall asleep and nothing else. The only good song is ""Money"" but beyond that song this cd is bad unless you want some easy listening music to fall asleep to."
3,where is the end of each song?,"Needless to say, this is a great classic album. The way it was chopped into songs without the full endings, ruined the whole thing for me. I want to hear it ALL, the way I remember it from the album, including the full endings of each song. I know they meld together, but please don't just chop them off!"
3,Another Reason to Own A Turntable,"The CD format of music is great, they last longer, they're portable, etc., but there are albums that need to be heard in their original format to fully be appreciated. This is one of them. If you are truly a fan of Pink Floyd, it is money well spent to buy a quality turntable and locate a pristine copy of this in Album format. Original analog recordings just don't sound correct in a digital format."
3,Possibly the Most Overrated Album of All Time,Money and Time are great tracks and fully account for the three stars in my rating. The rest is pure pretentious drivel.
3,"Good, not as great as all the rave reviews","When people talk about Pink Floyd. The album most often cited as their best album is this one. And I don't really understand why. It is a good album, I can enjoy it front to back. But most of the album is simply good, not great. There are only two stand out track in my opinion: Time and Brain damage. The rest of the album does an excellent job of transition but are not worth listening on its own in my opinion. For a starter Floyd CD I'd much rather recommend Wish You Were Here or Animals. The Wall has more moments of brilliance than this album as well, but the weaker part of the Wall are too weak in my opinion, so much so that I often skip half that album just to get to the good parts(Brick in the wall pt2, Mother, Young Lust, Comfortably Numb ect...)Track RatingSpeak to Me 2/5Breathe 4/5On The Run 3/5Time 5/5*The Great Gig in the Sky 4/5Money 4/5(borderline 5/5)Us And Them 3/5Any Colour You Like 3/5Brain Damage 5/5*Eclipse 4/5*album picks"
3,"ok, overrated","not as good as wish you were here or animals, but better than the pretentious, silly the wall.oh and i heard you can watch this with a movie and it will act like the soundtrack. i think it's lord of the rings or turner and hooch or something. it might be something old, though."
2,Way too overrated album!!!!,"Don't get me wrong, but this album is way to overrated. I don't understand how an album can get so much credit when it is musically shallow. This is what I consider the 5 greatest albums of all time:1. The White Album (The Beatles)2. Revolver (The Beatles)3. Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (The Beatles)4. Rubber Soul (The Beatles)5. Abbey Road (The Beatles)"
1,"""The Wall"" Was Better","Some say this is better than ""The Wall"". I urge you to listen to both albums back to back and conclude which was the better effort. Whereas ""Dark Side of the Moon"" is a mere nine tracks with no real story to follow (just a theme and some instrumental stuff), ""The Wall"" is a feature length production of 26 tunes that was worthy enough to be embelished into a movie. Need I say more?"
1,THUD! THUD! THUD! THE SEVENTIES ARE OVER!!!!!!,"IF you were born after 1965, don't even think of wasting money on this. It's music for old people (i.e. baby boomers) and pimply-faced seventies teens with their awful black t-shirts. Spend your money on a haircut and ""Never Mind The Bullocks"" (and, if you don't get the last reference, you might as well end it all now). This album is slow, boring and took too long to make. If you're saying to yourself ""But it was so popular and it was in the charts for years"", remember that millions wasted money on bell-bottoms and mood rings."
1,Very bland and boring.,This should never be classed as ROCK MUSIC. Its bland boring experimental music. WITH NO GUTS! I blame Pink Floyd for throwing ROCK music of its TRUE path. And now look where it is today. AVOID!!!
1,I am gettin so tired of this!!!,"You know what, why is this stupid record considered so great? So if you're trippy, people like dark side of the moon??? Waters even said they weren't musicians. If you want an album that is trippy, musically innovative and what turned rock music into an artform, then go out and buy a copy of ""real musicians"" music, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. When I first heard Lennon's haunting voice in "" A Day in the Life"", right then I knew why the Beatles are and will be the most important, and greatest band ever. So quit comparing this run on album to anything the Beatles ever did!!!!!""Helter Skelter"" Baby!!!!!!!!"
5,simply amazing,"this cd is not only a cd that everyone should own, but it's one that everyone should tell their children about. pink floyd is not my favorite band, and dark side is not my favorite cd, but it is the one i could listen to the most. after numerous listenings it will never get old, you only appreciate it on deeper and deeper levels."
3,Good album but a little dated now.,"There was a time when all the talk was about this album. It was as if 'Pink Floyd' were the new 'Beatles', they managed to put synthesizers with rock rhythm and survive. And America fell in love with another British born group. This album is good, but I think the 'Wall' and even 'Wish You Were Here' are BETTER. 'Time' is the real gem on this album..."
2,yawn,"It's depressing that this album is the album that bonds newer generation of music fans with older music. I have own ""Dark Side Of The Moon"" since I got into music and still think its as overrated the day I bought it. I do admit its good and listenable but after hearing that it ""inspires generations"" and on top ten-lists then you begin to hate it. Everyone goes on and on about Pink Floyd sounding differnt and creating a new sound...They were just an acid that's it. Do yourself a favor and buy Pink Floyd's ""The Piper At The Gates Of Dawn"". Syd Barret was the real master mind behind Floyd, not this album and ""The Wall""."
2,Not DVD Audio or DTS 5.1 quality. Save your money.,"I know, I know....how can a guy bad mouth DSOTM from 1973? Hey, I was there the first time on vinyl and it is still a landmark recording. However it does not sound like much has improved with the 5.1 re-mix. It would have been better to go all the way and re-mix it in DTS or DVD Audio (5.1) rather than try the hybrid SACD format. I have an excellent BOSE 6.1 sound system and this release of a great album is a real disappointment. If you're looking for bigtime surround sound out of this version...fahgettaboutit, it won't happen. Bummer, dude!"
5,The First Side is by far the best.,"When I was 12 I heard Dark Side of the moon and pretty much left it on the first side. Now, over 20 years later, I am wearing out the other side...actually I've gone digital too, but the point remains the same."
5,Pink Floyd's Greatest,"""Dark Side of the Moon"" is by far the best album Pink Floyd released. ""Dark Side"" continues to grab more listeners and ensure Pink Floyd's popularity for years to come. (And the live version from P.U.L.S.E is even better!)"
5,WOW! GREAT ALBUM,THE ALBUM THAT DOSEN'T GO AWAY. IVE LISTENED TO IT AND NOW I KNOW WHY. HAS MODERN SOUNDS CONSIDERING IT'S 1973 . A MUST FOR EVERY ROCK AND ROLL FAN.IT'LL BLOW YOUR MIND
4,Best of the 70s,"While Pink Floyd will never be held in the same Esteem as the Beatles. They produced some interesting albums in the 70s. DSOTM is by far their most appealing. My only major criticism is the lack of mood and tempo change throughout the album. Otherwise I would've given this 5 stars. But tracks like ""Time"",""Money"" and ""Brain Damage"" ARE really class rock music. And to the person who puts Britney Spears above Pink Floyd (GET REAL) You have no Idea about ""REAL"" music. Britney spears is manufactured pop dross for christ sakes!!!"
5,Blew me away.,This is how I wish all rock groups played. I love Soul and funk music and these guys were actually getting a little funky on this one! I heard this album in my high school psychology class this past year because my teacher wanted to show how it goes along with the Wizard of Oz (it does and it freaked everyone out). I often said Pink Floyd sucked just to piss off some of my white friends. I don't anymore instead I say Hoobastank or whatever crap they listen to sucks but Pink Floyd doesn't suck they are one of the best bands ever (not better than Earth Wind & Fire or Isley Brothers but good enough for me).
5,I love it!,"This is one of my favorite albums of all time! Among my favorite songs are 'Time' 'Money' 'Brain Damage' and 'Elipse.' My favorite line of all time is on this album, in 'Time': 'Words that either come to naught or half a page of scribbled lines.' I highly recommend this album. 'The Wall' is another good one by Pink Floyd."
4,Haunting...,"simply amazing.. on word of mouth only i bought this cd,(which is SOOO unlike me haha) and i was not dissapointed..put this in if you are in a rut,on a high or just simply goin thru the motions. in short.. BUY THIS!!! unparalled in this era,the only group i can see coming close to carryin on floyd's legacy is radiohead."
5,The Classic LP,"This is a classic release. It deserves it's reputation as one of the all-time greats. It rules in sound, content, and emotion. I can't believe there are people here that don't appreciate what are the best lyrics on any Rock release to date! I guess they just don't get it. Live a few more years, listen again, and if you still don't get it, you haven't learned a thing."
5,One of Two,I only own two Pink Floyd CDs. This and Delicate Sound of Thunder. No Music collection is complete without this CD.
5,886 people can't all be wrong - and they aren't,"From listening to this storming through Scotland in a 1973 Triumph Dolomite to blasting it out of my latest THX 5.1 system in California this has always been the greatest album of all. 886 review before me and it's still nearly a 5, well the ones that didn't give it a five probably just slipped on reviewed the wrong album. This is one of the few albums that has really stood the test of time, in the charts for most of my life and still there now."
1,DVDs scratched in shipment,"DVDs scratched in shipment, and one CD has what looks like something lightly sprayed on the playing surface... I'd rather not put that in my player and risk it depositing on the playing laser of the CD player as the CD spins and heats up.A technicality is preventing my ability to return this to Amazon. There's no disputing the album's musical content, but this version of it was poorly packaged. My rating is so harsh because EMI should have known better after so many years as a publisher of music."
5,Someone Missed The Starting Gun On This One...,"Arguably the greatest event in rock history and quite possibly the most influential recording of the 20th century and yet Sony (in their ""infinite"" wisom) decide to release this recording only on a niche format. Why on Earth release this as SACD only, when but a tiny percentage of the music listening market own SACD players? Just why in God's name wont Sony release this 5.1 mix on a DVD format for Joe Punchclock who can't afford the 2000 odd dollars for an SACD player or SACD compatable DVD?Its such money-hungry decisions such as this that turns people against Sony and towards ""alternate"" music sources.Grab that cash with both hands Sony."
4,A great Dark Side remaster for SACD not CD,"I don't think I need to add anything about the content of this classic album. It's a great album ... enough said. However, sound quality of this 30th Anniversary remaster has a split personality. Kenneth Stuart said it well in his review about the quality of the CD layer of this ""Dark Side"" ... not very good. Better versions have been done. I agree with him that the UK Harvest CD of ""Dark Side"" is very good and not available now. The version in Sony's 'Shine On' Pink Floyd box set. is good also but expensive. However, the SACD layer of this 30th Anniversary remaster is outstanding (5 stars). Very natural, open, and dynamic sound. If you have a SACD player buy this one!Why isn't Kenneth Stuart' s review a spotlight review when 69 of 86 found it helpful? Maybe his ""2 star"" rating of the CD layer was hurting record sales ... Ya Think?"
3,Make Sure Your PC Can Read,"One of the best albums ever, and one of the best candidates for an SACD treatment. However, there is at least one gotcha:Before you buy, for use in a PC or PC-based home entertainment system, make sure that you have a DVD or CD player that can read the SACD format. Not all DVD players are SACD-compatible, and it can be quite a rude shock have your computer claim that you've bought a completely blank disk."
5,A brilliant and mysterious album,"Dark Side of the Moon was one the best albums of it's time and continues to appeal to new music fans around the world. It's a short but brilliant album, exploring sonic textures to their fullest. It moves at a relaxed pace, yet still manages to keep you along for the haunting ride it has to offer. Although it has its radio staples ""Money"" and ""Time,"" DSOTM's true ""gem"" is (Us and Them) It's a song that takes you on a roller coaster from start to finish, with it's jazz and blues sounding instrument sections to it's massive buildup into the amazing chorus's. Adding to the Legacy of the album is that it can be played along perfectly to the Wizard of Oz for some Mysterious moments that make it seem as if the album was made to play along to the film. DSOTM is also Pink Floyd's best ""Casual Listener friendly"" album so if your new to the band I recommend starting your Pink Floyd collection with this great album."
2,Blut Ray disc is a bad disc,"I love Pink Floyd (even though my favorite album is Wish You Were Here), but the Disk #6 is Blu Ray and it doesn't work so I have to load the whole package up including the marbles to sent back to exchange the bad disk. Stupid! Has anyone else have this same problem with Amazon?"
3,Not Pleased,"Pink Floyd is my all time favorite band. I listened to my DSTM LP many more times than I can remember. I downloaded this MP3 CD and listened to it with headphones the first time. I was very disappointed to learn who ever remastered this put in ""hard"" brief dead space between songs. It is NOT like listenting to the LP. I wish I could return it."
5,Best of the 70s,"This is the best from one of the best- Pink Floyd. It looks like everyone has said just about all you can say about this one.Led Zeppelin can be credited for having the best collection of 70s studio works, but this album tops everything from that decade. It's in the short list of 'best of the decade'. It's up there with the 60s' Sgt. Peppers album by The Beatles."
3,Review of LP version,"I first heard this soon after moving to the States in the '70s. I had really liked the early Pink Floyd -- See Emily Play, Saucerful of Secrets, Atom Heart Mother -- but my first reaction on hearing this album was that they'd sold out and dumbed down to satisfy American tastes. After their early years on the progressive vanguard with groups like the Soft Machine and King Crimson this was really their first commercial album, and although very slick and beautifully engineered, the creative, experimental, essential Englishness of the early work had gone."
2,Here it goes....I'll be ridiculed to death..................,"Sorry folks. This album is not that good. I know its been on the music charts for years... I know its constantly being played on the radio... I just fail to get it.""Money"" and ""Time"" seem to be the only tunes to my liking - the others just seem to be drug-induced, slow, and depressing. After owning this album back in the late 70s, I never once thought about getting it on CD.Just to let you all know, my favorite Pink Floyd album is 'ANIMALS'. That one you can't miss with."
2,Get The Piper at the Gates of Dawn instead,"I thought this album was just okay when I heard it (and I did give it several chances). And then I heard the best Pink Floyd album there is--Piper at the Gates of Dawn, which absolutely crushes this attempt at music. Anyone who has heard Piper knows what I mean--that is an album that is psychedelic music at its best. So, don't bother with this one--get Piper, the true Floyd masterpiece. Sorry about not talking too much about Dark Side, but I thought I could get through to people who praise Dark Side here better than when reviewing Piper--I don't know how many of you out there have even heard of Piper. Still skeptical? Just try The Piper at the Gates of Dawn."
5,my apology,this is great music. truly a masterpiece put out by a brilliant band. there was once great music like this...now that i'm 15 today's music sucks up the bung hole...take advantage of this one in a lifetime masterpiece and grab it before it's too late. this is really good music. i apologize for the crap that my generation is putting onto radio stations these days...support progressive rock bands like these and buy this album
2,Boring and overrated,"I used to listen to Pink Floyd in High School and college. It is music that is meant to be listened to in an altered state, if you know what I mean :-) But, the fact is, now at the age of 33, I would never pop in a pink floyd album. The music is dull, pessimistic, and it drones on folks.Bottom line: If you are under 22, still in college--buy it.Adults with any Self-worth and sense of hope = don't buy it!BTW=I gave it two stars b/c some of the songs, while in college, were pretty cool."
3,I was hoping for more...,"I now have 3 versions of DSOTM on disc: ""Original Master Recording"", the 30rd Anniversary issue, & now the Experience Version. Maybe my ears are shot from too much loud music over the years but I honestly don't hear any difference between these recordings. So why did I purchase this latest version? I wanted the live performance & I wanted to see if there was more interesting album art. I have a bootleg of a radio broadcast of a live performance of DSOTM & there's very little difference, either in the performance or the quality of the recording. The album art was underwhelming; there were no new photographs or liner notes.If I could do it all over again I'd save my money."
3,Not worth your money.Same as previous remasters.,"This remaster is nothing but another money grab.Years ago I was lucky enough to buy on E-Bay ""The Dark Side"" transferred into DTS by somebody.There is no words to express this version of the recording.The latest remaster of ""The Dark Side"" sounds like mono comparing to DTS.I wish all of them were released in DTS,than you can have your best Pink Floyd to listen to.If you have already a copy of ""The Dark Side"",do not bother and don't buy new one."
2,Great packaging at least...,"The packaging is great, all I had hoped. Unfortunately the manufacturing of the vinyl, or part of the packaging (looks like it was dragged across something) process, was done poorly. The album came scuffed on both sides, one side substantially. Pops and clicks are present throughout. I gave it a thorough cleaning with a Nitty Gritty 1.5 cleaning unit which helped a little but the pops and clicks are still everywhere. Easily the worst sounding new LP I have purchased, very dissapointing."
5,Relevant Over 30 Years Later,"Incredibly, Dark Side Of The Moon, by Pink Floyd, was released almost 35 years ago. The amazing thing is that this excellent CD is still important and relevant today. I can listen to Us and Them over and over again. The hypnotic perfection of this CD is amazing. Most bands would love to have a collection of greatest hits that would rival this one album by this incredible band. If you have not heard this, you are in for a treat. A Five star masterpiece."
5,Pink Floyd,"Pink FloydAll over the globe many people have heard the name, and know that it's a band, just as many others. But some people have never got to know it, or have never ever heard a track, but they just talk 'bout it as if they know it.Pink Floyd has a peculiar studio sound and has one of the best live sound of all bands. In their lyrics they write 'bout the system, 'bout division (no matter what), 'bout war, starvation, policy and politicians, 'bout diseases, and 'bout nothing at all. To show their messages and what they mean, they use everything they can... If you see, messengers like: Bob Marley, Bob Dylan, Jim Morrison, John Lennon, Jimi Hendrix, and so many others, have always said, thought and fought the same way that Floyd does; this messengers use, and used all, the same old basic way that exists to show a deep feeling.That is such a way that, it can get every single soul shaking about. This such misterious way is Music (Art).Many"
3,A little Dissapointed,"Well, I love the album. When it came I could have been any more excited to play it on my new record player but...........it was warped, unplayable. Now, here I am, dark side of the moon-less ( except on my ipod and cds but still) putting my record under my textbooks from school trying to flatten it out.3 stars for the album-2 stars for the condition"
5,Amazing to find cassettes!,Gift for my husband. He loves it. Tore up his old one and was upset and couldn't believe I found a brand new cassette on Amazon!
4,"The Dark Side of the Moon, and then some","I picked up this and the Wish You Were Here Immersion Box Sets when they were Lightning Deals. I am a fan of the Pink Floyd but in no way consider myself a rabid consumer of all things Floyd.The productions on these discs are well done and while I've not played every one, I'm happy with what I've got. Indeed, when the rest of the family is out I sometimes enjoy putting this or WYWH on the stereo.Is this a MUST HAVE item? Hardly. But if you know someone who appreciates all the bells and whistles this box includes, go right ahead."
5,AWESOME CD,AWESOME CD GREAT MUSIC A MUST HAVE FOR ANY COLLECTOR LOVE THIS BAND GREAT MUSIC ANYONE OR ANY AGE WILL ENJOY
5,Timeless Rock,"I had this album when it 1st came out 35 yrs ago - damn near wore it out,but ended up losing it when our basement flooded some years ago. Since then I have owned the Audio cassette and the CD versions but neither compared to the sound of the Dark Side of the Moon on vynl. There was just a seminal sound of the early vynl version that reached into my heador maybe it was just the weed back then, anyways, I now own it on vynl again and it's just as good now as it ever was."
3,Scratched CDs!,"Beautiful edition. I liked all of its content. But how to store CDs, is a joke, mine came loose, scratched."
4,Old Agitated's right again but.....,"I read most of Agy's reviews because he's put me on to some stonkin great stuff, but he works backwards. For me they all are 4-5 star material. I bought Justin Trousersnake on his reccomendation, nuff said. Though this SACD is not the great recording, people are making out. I've only got 2 channel SACD and it lacks that absolute crispness, found on the Stones and Dylans reissues. On my system(2 channel SET) its not master tape clear, maybe the original recording was not that transparent, and the veil cant be lifted . Music wise it cant be faulted, one of the alltime greats, so I give it 95% for music and 85% for sound."
3,"Ummmm..uh..Mr. Emperor, sir? You..err.. have no clothes on","'Dark Side of the Moon' is the least battered album in my Pink Floyd collection. I get it out occasionally to listen to 'Time'. (I listen to 'Brain Damage' and 'Eclipse' off the 'Works' album.) There are other Floyd albums which have superior playing and more interesting lyrical and conceptual ideas. 'The Wall', for all its glaring imperfections, is one of them. 'Wish You Were Here ' is another. Sorry, your Majesty."
2,remastered version poor quality,"This is specifically for the remastered version. Others wrote about getting poor pressings, and I am one of those. It was good until the end of the second side. It sounded like there was a scuff on the record, but a visual inspection shows no scratches, so it must be in the way it was made. Secondly, there are some sonic differences from the original recording. There was something disturbing about the cut: ""on the run"". I think the problem is that there is a slight time offset between the percussion (cymbals) and the rest of the instruments. It is really annoying."
5,just about as close to perfect as an album can get.,"i listen to this album every night while i sleep . just try it put your repeat on and rest easy for the rest of your days. i love the band and the album. i also advise you to watch the movie ""THE WIZARD OF OZ"" while listening to ""THE DARD SIDE OF THE MOON"" enjoy it on me!"
4,Amazing Secrets!,This is a great album.David Gilmour's Voice and guitar playing is totally outstanding.A true Pink Floyd fan know's that there is a secret behind every Pink Floyd Album.This album goes along with The Wizard of Oz.The music tells the story to it.Most people don't think that it fits.But a true Pink Floyd fan can see it!
3,Overplayed,"""Dark Side of the Moon"" is carefully produced, vaguely intelligent, and superior to the vast majority of shlock on the radio today. Unfortunately, it also gets boring and really rather conventional when you get down to it. Nice try, but you need to be in a trance to sit through it all."
3,Buy This Over The Japanese Version With OBI Strip,I recently purchased the Japanese version with the obi strip $200.00. Please save your money and buy this Mo-Fi version. I have both now. The Japanese (so called collectors issue) is slightly and I mean slightly better. The only way to tell the difference is if you have a high end system as I do. So again please save your $$$$$$$$ and buy the Mo-Fi cd which I rate as a 3 and the Japanese version as a 3.1 for sound quality.
5,Amazing,"This album is really painful to listen to-- it's exactly why I love this CD. All of the tracks, specifically ""Time,"" have lyrics that just depress the hell out of me, i can really feel what they're saying. Amazing."
5,"A classic, a masterpiece and a suggestion","This album is clearly a classic (I bought it on vinyl, 8-track, cassette, then CD). Also love Wish You Were Here. Roger Waters' tour this summer was awesome, as he played many of these tracks!A suggestion... finally after 25 years there's another album that can compare with this - ""UP"" from R.E.M. released in 1998. Much resemblance - exceptional harmony, sonic effects, melodically rich and timeless work that gets better with repeated listening!"
5,Outstanding !,"Quite simply, the best 5.1 music mix I have ever heard. You are sat in the middle of an amazing album being played."
5,Pink Floyd album,"The first album I received had an ugly white scratch on the cover. I emailed the vendor and he immediately replaced it. What incredible customer service. I will come back and search for him the next time I am looking for more album covers to hang as art. Thanks, Al!"
5,Dark Side Gold,This is an excellent album from an excellent group. Pink Floyd's best album can only get better.
3,while good it pales in comparison to Zeppelin,"For the record this album is rather impressive and does have it moments, ie Money and Brain Damage but really, comparing Floyd to Zeppelin is really rather odd. I enjoy this album from time to time to be sure but this group never once produced an album worthy to stand next to Zoso or Physical Graffiti. Pink Floyd is good but they do not deserve the near godlike status that they are given so frequently."
2,Dark Side of the Moon,"Music originally recorded on analog tape AND mastered correctly, as was Dark Side of the Moon, make digital re-issues of any format a mute point. While SACD is a step in the right direction, even well-kept, original vinyl is superior. The vinyl, half-speed, two-channel master recording by Stereophile(long out of print)is the best way to experience DSM. Listen to music as it was recorded, not by electronically enhanced bits and bytes. Analog to digital reviews are a waste when the original format is obtainable."
5,Dark Masterpiece-themes are primarily madness and death,"I like the Wall better but you can't really compare the two. This album has a bleak, resigned weariness to life that I've never heard captured by anyone else. The songs really are not so memorable, its the overall sound, the bleak and depressing atmosphere that makes this album a masterpiece. Its an album full of quiet, repressed terror, the knowlege that all life may be worthless and futile, that we spend our life wasting it on petty things and all we have to show in the end is death, that everyones probaly insane and sanity is just a state of mind, you know theres no dark side of the moon, its all dark. Brain Damage/Eclipse are the most powerful and intriguing songs on the album, I've never heard anything quite like them on any other rock album. This is a difficult album to listen to listen to because its so real. To me its like reading Twains The Mysterious Stranger or Candide(Except without the humor of the latter.)"
3,"Great, but......","I have been a fan for 48 years. Have over 30 bootlegs (collectables)and maybe 100 other studio CDs. I was highly anticipating this set, but like other comments here I was disappointed when I opened the box. Nothing really 'new' to me here. I have most of these versions already. But one thing that kinda got me upset was the 'three' marbles. Why not four or five. I can only assume that they represent the three surviving members.I will order the other two 'sets' coming out. 'Wish you were here' and 'The Wall'. simple because I love The Floyd and wish to relive my youth and turn my children on to their timeless music."
2,5.1 Mix Not the Best,"I have many SACD's and this is the worst as far as it doesn't JUMP out at you. My Yamaha V2600 sounded better in the 7 speaker stereo mode which is not typical. Normally the 5.1 SACD is so much crisper and cleaner. This 5.1 on many tracks is muddy, the best way to describe. Also the bass and sub bass not really good. I don't understand the good reviews it got, I would agree more with the bad ones."
5,Simply don't get how there are folks rating this 2 & 3 stars??,"My fellow Amazon'ers...disregard the overanalytical, pessimistic audiophile nerds who gave this two stars. The live disc is awesome and the remastering on the original studio album is good too. But don't miss out on the live disc, if you love live music cd's as much as me and love pf like i do, you'd be shooting yourself in the foot by not getting this."
1,Kinda lame and damaged,"Not only is this box a sort of cool, but not a cool as previous boxes, but the price should have demanded more. In the bottom of the box are four stick on posts to hold the bare discs in. Of course, all four disc are floating around in the box covered in scratches, GOUGES, and a gummy glue substance--no doubt form the two holding posts that were also floating arounds the box. As a record collector of 40 years I am horrified. The only worse product I have seen in a while is The Wall Immersion box which was almost twice the price and even less impressive. Beware."
5,Dark Side Of Oz!,"Try it, I don't know who figured this out, but if you play the Wizard of Oz, and during the 3rd lion's growl on the MGM logo, hit play on Dark Side, and everything matches up. It will blow your mind."
5,True artistic Masterpiece,"Pink FLoyd's ""Dark Side of the Moon"" is one of the albums that proves over and over again that the boundaries of music are limitless. The album holds a special unique place in the universe of art. Every sound, rhythm, and lyric furthers the albums story of life, loss, and death. The whole album melts together to a heartbeat rhythm, with musical highs and lows. From the swirling electronic soundscape of ""on the run"", to the biting sarcasm and anger of ""money"", to the final climax of sound where the message of the album comes full circle, ""dark side of the moon"" takes us on a aural and mental journey that is rarely found in Pop Music. Pink Floyd were truly innovative and creative, pushing back boundaries and redefining the idea of music.For best results, listen with a good pair of headphones in the dark."
4,Not even close to the best of all time,"This I would rate number 38 on my all time greatest albums. Here are my top 5:1. The White Album (The Beatles)2. Revolver (The Beatles)3. Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (The Beatles)4. Abbey Road (The Beatles)5. Rubber Soul (The beatles)If you buy any of these albums, you will be hooked for life.DSOTM is good, but a little eratic."
2,Two 3-letter words: art to pop,This album was the end of Pink Floyd's once mighty tenure as the psychadelic kings. After this album there was no turning back. Darkside of the Moon is just a bad version of Obscured by Clouds and isn't there best work. People can go ahead and concider this their best album but lyrically only Brain Damge is the only appealing selection and musically Eclipse is the only song that displays any effort form the band itself. All and all compared to non-Pink Floyd albums it is a masterpiece but this album introduced Pink Floyd to their doom and that was fame and fortune.
1,Surround mix of SACD is horrible compared to the quad mix!,"This is one of the best albums i ever heard. But, like Hey Mo!! already indicated: The surround mix of the SACD is absolutely horrible compared to the original Alan Parsons quadrophonic mix. Tha SACD mix has only added 'ambient effects', while the AP quad mix is really discrete and adds 3 extra dimensions to the album.It's too bad that the AP mix is not available for the general public, so you can verify my opinion. Let's hope this changes soon!"
4,Sounds great,"The record sounds great for being so old. The only time you can tell its old is when it gets very quiet and you hear some static. Besides that, its great."
2,Overrated,"Everyone keeps rambling how great this CD sounds, and how way ahead of it's time it is. Yeah, back in 1973. Now it sounds as silly and dated as most of the music from that era. So it has been a consistent seller and one of the top albums of all time. So has Michael Jackson's ""Thriller"" and the ""Saturday Night Fever"" soundtrack, but I don't see anyone rambling about how great those CD's are. There is nothing ground-breaking about this CD; it's just plain pseudo-intellectual fodder, designed to make the listener think he/she is really into something deep. DSM has been certified 15x platinum here in the U.S over the last 25 years. The Backstreet Boys debut album has been certified 11x platinum already. Does that mean these are great albums? No, it just means the American public has bad taste when it comes to buying albums."
2,How To Butcher A Classic,"I'd like to know who made the decision on how the tracks were separated and if he was drinking at the time. I understand that one song merges into another and the CD should be listened to as a whole and not individual tracks, but at least whoever put together the version I bought back in the 80's understood that you DO NOT separate tracks in mid-lyric or in the midst of a musical phrase when there is clearly a spot that makes more sense. If I thought I could return this and get my money back, I would; remastered and improved sound or not. As it is, I'm going to try to do my best Alan Parsons and correct the problems with my Roxio software. Failing a suitable fix, I'm sticking with my 20+ year-old copy on my computer/Mp3 player."
3,Poor pressing quality,"The pressing quality is not quite up to par. There was quite a bit of surface noise in the lead-in and the trail-out deadwax. Many annoying pops and ticks while playing on various different tracks. Multiple cleanings helped, but only cut surface noise a bit. The record labels are bubbled around the outer edge. One side of the record has a streak across it from the outer edge to the deadwax. The sound quality is OK but not really impressive compared to the 2003 30th Anniversary edition. The original 1973 U.S. version of the LP actually sounds better than the 2011 version. The U.K. and German SQ quadraphonic versions are superior to all. The gatefold album cover and the extras inside, like the posters and stickers, are the best of the best."
5,One of Pink Floyd's best,"First of all, I have to say that the original copy I received of this was defective near the end of the disc and unfortunatly for me the replacement sounds a tad less great than the original(the bass seemed more up front on the original defective copy)but this is kind of nitpicking I guess. I should also add that some of the other instruments on my new copy seem more up front than on the defective copy. However, to me after owning just about all the other copies out there, this to me, sounds the best. This is my favorite Floyd along with Meddle(so when do we get the SACD of that?). I know some people aren't too happy with the SACD versions but I think they're great. It's funny, but I'm usually the one who complains about favorite albums being changed when there released on cd but I just don't see why anyone wouldn't like this version. Believe me I'm very nitpicky when it comes to cds esp. favs but this one rocks out loud."
1,Devastated,I can't listen to the entire album without the dead time between songs and there is often overlap from one song to the next. I bought the whole album to avoid this. I didn't see it as one piece of music. No more albums for me.
2,Lot of money for this,Nice but really nothing there worth that much unless you play with marbles but enjoy those rare 8 track recordings on CD's. Hard Cores will buy anything.
2,I heard better things,"With the exceptions of The Great Gig In The Sky , Time , Us and them ( truly masterpieces ) the rest of the album never impressed me so much and will never do. The better things that I was talking about in the title of this review have been made by the Floyd themselves especially the overlooked MORE."
2,"""There is no dark side of the Moon. In fact, it's all dark.""","If you come to this album, as I did, having heard nothing from Pink Floyd but -The Wall-, you may be disappointed. If parts of this recording sound like the Alan Parsons Project, or even -Abbey Road-, it's probably because Alan Parsons was an engineer on both albums. In any case, any of those is superior to this (yawn) pretentious and overrated album. Listen for that voice at the very end: a very -Abbey Road- like gimmick."
3,pink floyd,"the concept behind pink floyds dark side of the moon is about everyday life and how it stresses you. songs like ""time"" which is about working and how it wastes all your time."
1,not satisfied,It does not play loud enough to hear it; not satisfied at all. I love Pink Floyd and was very disappointed when I tried to listen to it.
2,Dissapointed Floyd fan,I've been a Pink Floyd fan for 40+ years and was excited about this release after reading reviews. Nothing earth shattering in the remix and the live version leaves a lot to be desired.
1,The most overrated album in music history,"I have no idea why this is one of the best-selling albums ever. It's bad even by Pink Floyd standards; they did so much better on *real* classics such as ""Meddle"", ""Ummagumma"" or ""Animals"". I guess the electronics were kinda progressive in 1973, but whereas other music from that time (and before) still sounds as timeless as ever, this has become remarkably stale. Not to mention the pretentious lyrics. Lame lame lame. I guess this sells only because everybody recognizes the cover. In my humble opinion this is the worst, not the best, Pink Floyd album."
1,Pink Floyd are much better than this.,"I truly couldn't find one song worth keeping on this album, and I love Pink Floyd. They have some really good songs like ""Comfortably Numb"", ""High Hopes"", or ""Hey You"". I didn't like the ""Echoes"" Collection either because the songs were un-naturally spliced together where one song from an album ends and where one song from another album begins on the following track. They had to have altered at least 7 songs from their original endings and beginnings. It's like a complete album there."
1,Just plain silly,I loved DSOTM when I was 17. Which was 18 years ago. Now I can realise what a load of pretentious tripe it really is.
1,hoh!,this is one of the most boring albums ever! the same feeling goes on and on. when will it stop? it makes me sleep!
1,"A horse that badly needs flogging, if only it were dead","More slow-as-sludge Floydisms that everyone's heard billions of times. Will someone please make it stop? Not even the Bible is this overrated. If I hear even a snippet of ""Money"" one more time I'll learn how to build a pipe bomb in order to blow the master tape into another universe."
1,Buy Ringo instead..,"of this overrated CD.Pink Floyd to me died after the departure of Syd Barret.If you want to invest in a Floyd CD I highly recommend Piper at the gates of dawn which is easily their best and most inspired work and recorded right next door to those legendary gods the four horsemen,who were incidentally recording the greatest album ever with Sgt Pepper.Another highly recommended CD Btw. This album is plodding and after listening to it you are reminded of an Iggy Pop lyric that goes like this.""Im bored/Im the chairman of the bored! Get the picture."
3,Decent is about as enthusiastic as I can get,"Some songs/passages are impressive (Breathe, Us and Them), others starkly lacking (Time, Great Gig, Money) on this SACD. Instruments are discretely placed in separate channels about as much or as often as they should/could have been, but various vocal sections and instrumental ones are very hushed or subdued to the point of barely being present. And yes, all my channel levels are set correctly. Not like the original, for sure. This is the least impressive of my 5.1 SACD/DVD-Audio discs. Only a minor improvement over the stereo version letting Dolby Pro-Logic II do the surround. Get ""Avalon"" or ""Brothers In Arms"" and you'll see what I mean. Beatles' ""Love"" DVD-A is also quite impressive."
5,The Greatest Album Ever Made - Bar None,"I notice a reviewer gave this album only 4.5 stars [out of 5]and felt compelled to write in response. This is an album for the those who appreciate rock not for its volume or its pace, but for is ability to consume the listener completely transporting the mind to an altogether different and incredible place. This album is not a group experience. It is to be best enjoyed with earphones and eyes closed. Set some time aside, have a glass of wine or some such thing, and listen to the whole thing straight through. It is the closest you will come to an out of body experience. Devine."
5,Timeless,"I bought this as one of my first CDs in the early 90s. I had heard individual songs from Dark Side of the Moon on the radio, but I had never listened to the whole album. I couldn't understand why it had been on the Billboard charts for so long; sure, the songs were OK, but what made it last so long? When I finally listened to the whole CD it was an epiphany. This CD has to be in your collection, and it has to be heard in its entirity every time. It's not a collection of songs like most CDs. Don't buy it to impress your friends, buy it to impress yourself."
4,"Good SACD mix, but redbook CD mix is flawed.","The other reviews on the 30th anniversary edition are mostly right. While the SACD mix is breathtaking, the the mix on the CD layer has fatal flaws. The level matching was incorrectly done, and there are many clipping in loud passages. The clippings are measurable, and in many case audible as well.http://www.stereophile.com/news/11649/See the measurement done by the popular audio magazine."
4,The Gramaphone co. Ltd.,"The company that made this album should use a little more quality control at the plant. The first one I ordered had tons of scuff marks and a scratch on the second side. My replacement still has scuff marks on it, but sounds good. I'm pretty sure this company is going to press The Wall and Wish you were here. Please, be careful when you make those. I'm sure there were other companies bidding for the HONOR to make these albums, treat it as such, and tell your employees how important these albums are to rock history."
2,Don't Succumb To The Pressure,"I think folks need to finally realize that the continuing sales performance of this record is largely due to peer pressure. At some point it just became ""hip"" to own it, like a lava lamp, or rubik's cube. Unfortunately, for the world, this isn't a fad like the two aforementioned items."
1,dark side stinks,"I really tried to like this album. seen it on all the top album lists + how it was in the charts for a million years. i cant stand it. even tried listening to it every day for a couple of weeks to see if it needed to grow on me. well it did not. whats with all the sound effects????? clocks, running,cash registers, ect. oh, and that chick screaming for what seems to be hours. grew up + still love, beatles, stones , led, zep, hendrix ect but sorry to say , dont dig this album at all!"
3,Listen to it when you're high,"Some songs are brilliant, some are quite boring. It's good, but it's also overrated. Far from the ""greatest album of all time"" as many claim.I'm guessing that it's much easier to enjoy when you're high. Very, very high."
3,The First Pink Album I Bought,Maybe I'll give this CD a 3 star because it was good but notgreat. The best song was probably MONEY. All the songs I thoughtwere pretty good. This still dosen't rank the best album of alltime. It could be better the next time I listen to it.
2,Snore,"The album will cure your insomnia though. Five minutes and you'll be out like a light. Given that I despise Pink Floyd, I will say that this is their finest album. See, there's a compliment after all!I don't do drugs. Maybe I should start taking them if I want to appreciate this band."
1,Seriously overatted music,Don't buy this unless you want to fall asleep its BORING drivel. Britney Spears makes great music. One More Time has much better guitar riffs. And these guys are too...ugly to be popstars. Britney is cute. Buy Britneys albums instead for REAL music.
1,........BORING,"Wow....I am a fan of Wizard of Oz and he CLEARLY copied this as ""his"" soundtrack to the film...You can believe what you want but I really dis-like this cd!"
1,I don't get it,"OK, I guess this album is supposed to be relaxing? You don't hear any words until mid way into the 3rd song. yah really boring, instrumental, sleepy sounds. The song 'Money' is kinda random mabey it should be on another album because this song actually rocks! 'Great Gig in the Sky' is all piano and a woman singing (not words) just screaming (kinda opera like) This album sucks except for 'Money' which is one of my favorite songs. The firs two are extreamly long and all instrumental. and I really don't like this album."
2,One of the most overrated albums of all time.,"There are a couple good songs on here but if your looking for good songwriting look elsewhere. Most of the album is filler. Self indulgent wanking solos that most people would have to be stoned out of their gourd to enjoy. If you want better examples of the american electric heavy metal guitar style I recommend: Bon Jovi, Motley Crue, Judas Priest or the Scorpions."
1,Music for people with a poor taste,"I really detest Pink Floyd. This is one of the lousiest albums ever made in the history of rock music. I never liked Pink Floyd and I almost fell asleep one day when I heard this, this is just noise! Anyone who likes them needs to see a doctor. This is just boring sleep music. Even Neil Young's Greatest Hits has much better music than this. This has two of the lousiest songs ever like Us And Them and Time. Don't make the mistake of buying this boring album, get any of these albums insted.METALLICARide The LightningLoadBlack AlbumMaster Of Puppets...And Justice For AllMARK KNOPFLER SOLO STUFFThe Ragpicker's DreamSailing To PhiladelphiaFOREIGNERForeigner 4GREEN DAYAmerican IdiotWarningREMBest Of R.E.MTOM PETTYThe Last DJForget dirty bands like Pink Floyd and Led Zeppelin who suck and are meant for people with a poor taste. Metallica and Green Day are meant for people with good taste."
1,Bloody awful,"I've been trying to replace music that has been misplaced over the years and I picked up this version as an MP3 download. This remaster has ruined the flow of this album. At the end of every song the smooth transition that existed in the original vinyl and cd versions are gone. After attempting to listen to it once, I can't even bring myself to listen to it in the remastered form again."
2,Not as sturdy as THE WALL,"If anyone ever told you Dark Side of the Moon was Floyd's best album they indeed were left in the Dark. DSOTM is not nearly as durable as The Wall. The Wall both tells a story and presents a theme. DSOTM is merely a collection of songs, which receives too much recognition. With the exception of Breathe, Time, and Us and Them, DSOTM is anything BUT a concept album."
2,Overrated,"Don't believe all the hype about this album. Sure ,it's got some good songs on it, but a lot of it is just something you'd want to put on for background music-it's not something you can actually ""listen"" to attentively.I'm sure it sounds great when you're stoned but for a square person like me who doesn't take drugs much of the album is simply boring."
5,"Yes, this is THE BEST ALBUM ever made","It deserves more than 5 stars. If you are a real music lover,DSOTM must be in your collection. Too many people can't be wrong, allthe time it spent on Billboard Top 200 best selling albums is not a mistake. There's nothing I can say to make you buy this album, but I'm sure that if you listen to it (really listen) you'll become another fan of the band."
3,The Darkest Sale Of The Moon,"I share most every rewiwers opinion about this box set. Who needs the nonsence mercendise?! It only makes the release ""cheap""(!). We need all the cd's, dvd, blueray AND the vinyl AND a hardcover book with the story of making the album, the tours etc. The Stones Excile On Main Street is a gorgeous boxset!! And The Who Quadrophenia seemes to have that great standard. I will not bother with the other Immersion box sets!"
5,Even better than I hoped.,"I just got this SACD version today and my mind was blown. I have a decent sound system with 5 full range speakers (Interlude 40, 25c, 10), JBL PB10 subwoofer, Yamaha receiver, Sony SACD player, and I use really good cables and speaker wire. I previously had the MFSL gold version of this cd and the SACD version just kills it in every possible way."
5,The Classic,"They say that every few years a great album is made, first we had sgt pepper which changed music from then on. Then came this album which changed it again with all the special effects and great lyrics. A Great gig in the sky stands out as a classic with such haunting vocals. The album tracks just blend together with classics like Time and Money and the greatest finish to an album of Eclipse and Brain Damage. This album is a must for any music lover. And the album that made loads of people check out other great floyd albums such as Meddle and Relics."
5,It Gets No Better,"There is no words to explain or to justify this album. This was the first introduction I had with Pink Floyd and from this they gain a lifetime lover of their music. I only regret I couldn't have experience them ""live"" in concert. Driving and listening to this cd or any other cd by them, especially ""Animal or Wish You Were Here"" helps my mind come to terms with the thoughts I have."
5,Best Pink Floyd Album,The first time i heard money i was probably 8 years old. At that time I liked it. It wasn't until i was 18 that heard it again and was told that it was by a band called Pink Floyd.. Now that was about 6 months ago. If you want to get the full effect of Dark Side of the moon.. Sit in a completely dark room and then turn the album up loud. THen you can get the full effect.
3,Smooth but ultimately dull,"I'm all for the careful production and overall intelligent lyrical content of this fairly accessible album. But on the other hand, this gets pretty boring as it meanders on and on through its alienation for high school kids."
5,I love these album and always well!,Its Realy cool I don't care how old it is its steel cool . Pink Floyd is the best no other band is like them.
5,The definition of a classic,"Like the reviewer from Richland, WA, I know this isn't a message board, but I see a lot of people giving this album one-star reviews because they ""love classic rock, but hate this album."" Why would you buy an album that, 25 years later, is still well ahead of its time if you like old music? Go back to some blues and country based Rolling Stones or Bob Dylan. As much as you may dislike them, this band is way more experimental and interesting."
2,Packaging??,For $12 you'd think they could swing a hard jewel case like any CD you buy in a store....instead a soft sleeve..Really??/
3,Lyrics missing,Was expecting lyrics with the seemingly 'home made' cdguess you should mention this when you promote your serviceskinda false information to us consumers
5,Superb,One of the absolute best works in all of modern music! 'Great Gig in the Sky' and 'Time' are at the acme of a whole album of highlights.
4,Very pleased,"Never listened to this type of music but upon hearing some of it, bought it and find it very interesting. My son was surprised I had the CD as he liked it when it first came out and I was singing classical music. Good is good no matter the genra."
5,Makes me just wanna chilllllllllllll........,"I received this album about ten years ago from a friend,on vinyl,because it wasn't his ""style."" I only knew one song from Pink Floyd,""The Wall."" So I listened to this album one day,and was blown away!!So I ordered it and had it sent to me here in Iraq.I come back here to my quarters,let ""Time""play,and all I want to do is sit in the dark and float away!It's the perfect cd to just chill.........."
5,DarkSide of The Moon...box set,"Gift set for my son's Birthday who in turn admires ""PinkFloyd's"" music and talent far more than what is called ""Bands""/""Music"" of today...and Im very pleased that he has enjoyed the boxset that I purchased for him...Tkx Amazon for your sales and service to ""Fathers"" gift to there childern...will use ur svc more often....T..."
3,The packaging of the disc is terrible,"I am putting 3 stars because the music is simply AWESOME, no problem with this, if you're a pink floyd fan you wont regret this purchase, unless it arrives with all the disc flying around in the box (they got out of their socket) resulting in scratches all over them.Seriously for the price they could find a way to make sure all the cd's and dvd's arrive in perfect shape.Still, buy it, the music is great."
4,Great album exceeded by their earlier work,"Another amazing Pink Floyd Album, but Meddle, A Saucerful of Secrets, and Piper at the Gates of Dawn were all superior, reflecting a more psychedelic influence. This album is more of a mid 70s rock style, which is obviously great for the genre. Fortunately they ended on another amazing note with The Final Cut. Anything after that isn't really Pink Floyd."
5,The best of the best,My favorite album ever. The only album I know of that I wouldn't change a single thing. Perfect in every way.
5,Welcome to Oz,"I don't know what I can add anything that hasn't already been said about this landmark album. It would definately be one of my ""desert island"" CDs. I was introduced to it in college (89-93) and it will always be one of my favorite Floyd albums, thus...one of my all-time favorites as well. If by chance you don't own this album, I recommend running out and getting it right now, no matter what your musical tastes.To correct another reviewer...he said to start the disc while watching the Wizard of Oz when Dorothy appears in Oz.I believe the best way to sync them up is to start the CD during the MGM lion's third roar. Turn up the music, down the lights and enjoy...."
3,Box of trinkets.,"To put it simply...the Wembley 74 show is fantastic (five stars for that!) The rest of the contents of the box is so so. I really do not understand the scarf and the marbles. The books are nice as are the coasters. The other odd printed matter is just thrown in and does not bring much value to the release. I personally would have preferred more music content, a hardback book and less tchotchke. Stick with the Experience version and your wallet will be much happier."
3,Whats not to love -- but marbles??,"bought this at a local music store for the same price listed on amazon. the original tag is $160. this is NOT worth $160. Frankly, disc 6 is my favorite and i'm happy to hear a pre-dsotm edit. loved having ""that hard way"" loaded up along with the other gems on this disc.the marbles? wtf? the scarf?? the coasters (that only a fool would crack into and use)... too many odd gimmicks. the books, while they look nice and pretty are a joke. honestly, the die hards that will buy this set will want the music - old and ""new""the music outweighs the novelty. collectible marbles though? did i miss something?"
4,An Early Masterpiece!,"Aye! An excellent masterpiece indeed for Pink Floyd's early days...My favorite track on this album is most definitely ""Us and Them"". The reason why I don't give this one a five is because I compare it to the work done AFTER dark side... Pink Floyd is one band that continues to get better and better.... seeing as how they have had numerous better albums since then, I won't say this is their bast work... however, I do recomment ""The Division Bell"". Gilmour shows his true colors and I haven't heard a finer piece than ""Coming Back to Life""... So my rating for Dark Side is 4.9999999 stars :) and continued improvement!! Kickass!"
4,"Good, but still overated","Dark Side was a great album. But it was not that great. I love the songs, Time, Us and Them, Eclipse, Breath in the Air, and the instramental On the Run. But the song Money? That song was one of the most annoying pieces of garbage I have ever heard. The great gig in the sky is not much better, just some 'soulful wailing'. A good album, but overated."
5,The whole universe aligned for this one,"Forget all those people who have rated this under five stars. They are not to be trusted. What Roger Waters, David Gilmour, Rick Wright and Nick Mason achieved is of such brilliance it's even silly to review it. So I won't. I'm glad there's no light whatsoever on the dark side of the moon because then we should be able to contemplate the whole universe from there. All stars would be shining as bright as they could just like the music on this album does."
3,Disappointed,Look - I wanted to love this boxset! The music is sensational ... But... How can there possibly not be a single live performance of any of the dsotm songs visually?? I assumed the blu ray would have this.. But it's all audio... Be warned - you are not getting any album tracks performed live visually on DVD or blu ray. At this price - you really should have! Gutted.
3,Boring and breathtakingly conventional,"This is certainly Pink Floyd's most accessible album, and their best post-Barrett work. While I repect the fine production techniques that went into the album (it's best with headphones), I've never been able to listen to this methodical stuff from start to finish, all the way through. There's nothing terribly radical about it either, except for the occasional screaming woman. Still, ""Breathe"" and ""Brain Damage"" are fine songs, especially for alienated young men."
3,The beginning of the end of Floyd's innovativeness,"If this album were by any other band I'd probably rate it higher, but my standards for Floyd are higher than for other bands. Sure, Dark Side is far better than their recent works, like the Division Bell, but it can't compare to the truly brilliant albums of the past like Atom Heart Mother, Ummagumma, and Meddle. But, like all of us, I guess they had to pay the bills."
5,I can listen to this album repeatedly.,I love this album. I cannot stress how important it is for every person to have this album as a part of their collection. It is a true classic. If you don't have money to buy this album...steal it. It is that good.
1,I don't get it.,Why is this album so overrated? it's not nearly as good as most of their other recordings. This isn't as much an essential as I'd heard it to be. I wouldn't recommend buying it.
1,A poor attempt to match the Who.,"All the gimmicks in the world couldn't match the brilliance of ""WHO'S NEXT"" by the Who. This album tries to be clever and fails. It lacks that edge and drive to compare to a truly great rock album like the aforementioned. And when people I know have compared the two, they have come to a similar conclusion."
1,Wake me up when its OVER!,"My friend bought this album after buying into all the hype and boy was he dissappointed. I sat through this album and nearly fell asleep. How these boring old farts get so much credit I will never know.A, YOU CAN'T EVEN DANCE TO THIS DRIVELB, THEY CAN'T SING (COME ON ITS LIKE ANDROIDS)C, DON'T BUY THIS BORING CRAP (ITS AWFUL)"
1,Best Album Ever... Worst Issue Ever,"This is, of course a classic in every sense of the word. Every minute of the album is filled with some of the best music ever written and performed. However, this particular version is WAY to quiet to enjoy. Even with a powerful stereo on full blast, it can barely be heard. I don't know what they were thinking when they issued this version. It's like a huge mistake that wasn't caught in time.Buy and enjoy this excellent album, but stay far away from this version or you will be disappointed."
1,"man, this cd sucks","Man, I really expected this to be good, all my friends have been taking about for the last 12 years and then I went out and bought it and it.....well it was really boring and it was just dumb, like you had to smoke pot or something to understand it or enjoy it. man, was I dissapointed."
1,Don't buy! Vinyl is too noisy.,"Ranks as one of noisiest new vinyl records I have ever purchased. Obvious physical imperfections like fingerprints, scuffs, etc. I returned that copy. My 2nd copy had much less of the aforementioned, but still had a nasty tick once every revolution on Us and Them. That defect is in the pressing. Other audible ticks and pops as well. Terrible job. Guess I won't be buying Wish You Were Here and The Wall when they are released. What company pressed this?I cleaned this record using a VPI 16.5 wet-vacuum cleaning machine with L'Art du Son cleaning fluid. It was played back on a VPI Scout turntable."
2,Dark side of the moon,"This is not a rock album. This is a sad,maudlin effort that has enjoyed the benefit of mass hypnosis. It's not really bad, but, it was just a group of young people trying to tell us about life that they hadn't experienced yet. It sounds mostly like teenage angst. I'm sure the halucinogens they were using had stunted their emotional growth and made them think they were being profound. Either that or they knew what they were doing and the jokes on us."
2,Rather Borish,This is rather boring shyza I must say and may I also add in that it is overrated. If you want truly good old music look somewhere else. Rush and the Beatles smoke the pants of these tards.
3,"Not Bad, Not Great","This is an acceptable enjoyable piece; probably the best that Pink Floyd could attain. What is tragic is the cultish aura that surrounds this band, who never did reach the heights of the greats of their time. Memorable, yes, but more in the vein of Boston or ELO than the Beatles or Led Zeppelin. For those enjoy contemplating lesser things, O.K. But there's better music elsewhere. As far as pure Pink Floyd though, this is about as good as any. 3-stars."
1,very average and dated.,"I am very disappointed with this album after all the hype surrounding it.It has no energy and is very depressing. Time is the only decent song of the 9 on this album. And the album relies too much on special effects, and the vocals are void of any emotion. Save your money. Led Zeppelin are 10 times better."
1,My opinion was not wanted,I was threatened by a commenter that I would be sued for voicing my opinion. So I will not give any of my opinion here other than to state the one star is all this product deserves.
5,Pink Ployd - FOREVER!!!,"This is an amazing set, it is a true must have for any real Pink Floud fan. This album is as good now as the day when I got the original Dark Side of the Moon when it first came out."
3,Great Overrated Rock,"""Dark Side Of The Moon"" Is a great album and provocative at that. The errie music totally enthralled. Unfortunatly I was unble to enjoy it to the extent in which I would have. I was expecting more. To me the album was to much Instrimantal. There wasn't enough ""Time"" or ""Money"" type songs. It was mostly just music. GREAT MUSIC. What I am trying to do is to let you know that the albums stereotype as the best Pink Floyd album. Also know it dosn't add up to what the media tagged it. You'll be dissapointed if you beleive these rumors. It's an album worth buying though and it is a masterpeice."
3,"Beatles vs Floyd, enough already!!","Whoever keeps comparing Floyd to the Beatles needs to quit. Floyd is a different and an awesome band. Alright,everybody who is somebody knows the Beatles are the greatest and will always be the greatest, it's no secret people. But Floyd is great in it's own right, sure they aren't musically inclined as the Beatles but darn, Pink floyd is pretty cool"
5,"enough praise, here's a fact you may not have realized","enough has been said about the quality of this album. i'm not here to tell you it's good or bad. that's up to the listener.i'd just like to point out that this is the only album by the original band that has no acoustic guitar on it.it occurred to me that every other pink floyd album has at least one track with gilmour on acoustic guitar. yet, this is their most famous album.makes you think, don't it?"
5,"Come on, whatever you like, it's a shining moment","I was fortunate enough to be at Scope audiotorium the cold early Spring of the original Dark Side Tour in the schizoid spring of 1973, in an altered state sitting next to the campus cop who kept our stash safe in the dorms. Three black kids were sitting in front of us and we found that radical, and hopeful, and they were toking and nodding, and everyone pretty much melted when the planes flew around the coliseum in Quadrophonic, but when the three girls came out and the lead took over ""The Great Gig in the Sky,"" we all knew we were present at something new and special that would define our time.And it did."
5,The Alpha and the Omega,This is one of Pink Floyds BEST albums.If you are a Pink Floyd fan(which you should be!)And you havent heard this album...well nevermind thats impossible...but if you have never heard this album then buy it and listen to it a million times...you will anyway without me telling you to.
5,A modern-day classic.,"This is an album about human existance, our greatest fears, and what keeps us from living in harmony. This album encompasses the feelings and experiences of the entire human race as a whole. A true masterpiece."
5,A KID IS A MORON,"if no one else will do it i guess i will: ""A KID SHUT UP!""What have you got against this masterpiece of an album?It is consistantly voted one of the greatest albums ever made and usually tops most critics lists as the most influential record of all time.Pink Floyd inspired a generation of musicians with their albums. Dave Gilmores guitar playing is imperial and is in my opinion up there with Hendrix and Page as one of the greatest guitarists of all timeIf you've never listened to Pink Floyd this is a great album to begin with it sums up a lot of what Pink Floyd are about and their musical style.The album has sold 40m copies, if i were you i'd make it 40million and one!"
5,Atmospheric,"This is truly a masterpiece. When I was 14 my dad suggested that I buy this album. I did, and wasn't disappointed at all. Roger Waters and the gang pulled off a psychedelic, atmospheric masterpiece that still has intelligent, meaningful lyrics with socio-political views all on one continuous track."
5,darksideofthemoon,"This is one of the few albums that you can listen to the whole way through, notice i said ""you"", i normally skip ""on the run"", which is good, but i'm normally to antsy to get on with the cd to sit through it, but its still a good song. once you get to ""us and them"", you basically lose track of song changes they all just flow into one another so brilliantly, i especially like the change from 'us and them' to 'any color you like' its just great. This is a great first cd to buy, if you have now other floyd cds. i guess i'd say 'us and them' is my favorite song, even though i used to despise that song, then 'time'. David Gilmour is a genius soloist, all his solos seems so desperate, i dunno how that word came up, but it best describes what i'm trying to say. The way he'll bend notes, and hold em i dunno, it's great, makes you wanna cry, i dunno he has a way of crying through his guitar that makes you wanna hug him, haha, idunno. buy the cd."
3,"good, but very, very overrated","I'm sorry to say it, but even if DSofTM is a good album, is very far from be the ""greatest album of all time"", as Pink Floyd from be ""the greatest band of all time"". Just in terms of avant-garde and progressive music, there many bands better than Pink Floyd: King Crimson, Soft Machine, Van der Graaf Generator, Genesis in their good times, and the list can goes on. ""Amicus Platonis, sed magis amicus veritatis..."" So sorry and please, don't hate me!"
3,"""Aaaaahhh""","What's up with that screaming lady? She sure has a powerful voice, and it might have been a good idea to use her briefly once, but she keeps turning up over and over, and after a while her caterwauling drives me nuts."
3,"Overrated, but still good","This, along with ""Sgt. Pepper"" and ""Led Zeppelin IV"" is one of music's most talked about, popular yet way overrated album. I still like it though. ""Money"" is fun, ""Time"" is memorable, and ""Us And Them"" is nice. Sadly, I absolutely HATE ""The Great Gig In The Sky"", and ""Brain Damage"" This album really isn't for everybody (like the guy from Salt Lake City), but it isn't too bad"
5,The 'Kid' sucks,(...).This is a great CD. This is the best selling album and has been on the charts 30 years later from 1973. Have you ever heard of Pink Floyd at all? Where you around in the 70's?
5,What a set!!,The marbles included with this box set are the best marbles ever included with any classic album box set. I love them. They're smooth and round.
2,Buy the UK version,"I bought this at my local record store and was pretty excited to see how it sounded...turns out they did a pretty bad job. The vinyl is noisy and has lots of random pops here and there. Unacceptable for new vinyl. I saw another review saying that the UK version is actually produced properly and sounds as good as the original. Out of curiosity, I decided to buy it and see how it sounded, and yes, it sounds excellent and the vinyl is not noisy like the American version. So, I advise you to go on amazon.co.uk and buy it there and wait it out on the shipping. You won't be disappointed. Also, the UK version has a paper sleeve with a plastic liner. American version only has paper."
5,"To the Kid who said this is ""sissy""","All the bands you listed are the product of the great bands like Floyd, Zepplin, The Who and so on. Too bad you are a kid and will never understand the absolute brilliance of 70's classic rock that paved the way for the (mediocre) bands of today. Pink Floyd will long be rememberd far longer than the bands you listed, dark side of the moon is, and always will be a classic."
3,"Overrated, Overblown, Over-reviewed !!","Hey, what's wrong with the music community ! Haven't we talked enough of this album ? Though it's a good album, but it is definitely over-rated. This CAN'T be the best album of all times ? Being a true PF fan myself (collected all albums except the newer ones from Div Bell onwards) I definitely disagree that this is the best. Yes, in those days PF may be one of the first to use all kinds of electronic gadgetery, but that does not warrant it being the best. I wonder why most praise it like god, probably cause the others are doing it so ! Just follow the crowd ?Well, compared to other PF albums, to me this lie at the lower rung ! I mean this album lacks good melodies, and drags too long on monotonous tunes, like on Us & Them and Any Colour You Like. The best PF albums in order would be Wish, Animals, Wall, Atom Heart, Saucerful, Piper, More, Dark Side, Meddle, Momentary Lapse, Obscured, Ummagumma and Final Cut."
4,Time,"This album is vastly overrated and massively addictive and truthfully is not really a complete album at all. Time towers above all else and the other songs are just supporting players so to speak. One can easily just listen to Time over and over and over again ad nauseum and not even listen to the other tracks whatsoever, and yet Dark Side of the Moon would still serve its purpose and would still be worth owning. Time has never sounded better and is worth everything just to hear this one song alone. The other songs are all good as well and do help to make the album what it is, but if one were to be completely honest with themself they would realize that they have come to buy only Time and not the album as a whole. Sure this album is good, there's no denying that at all, but if Time were the only song on it then it would still be considered a masterpiece by many. Time is The Dark Side of the Moon pure and simple. The rest of the album is just there to make the album longer."
1,More gimmicks than substance,"""Why Pink Floyd"", is what came to my mind as I pondered how great this set could have been. Why include marbles and a scarf instead of the undoubtedly countless additional hours of material that must exist? Why require the Pink Floyd fan to pay over $100 to get the disc 6, the only unheard material for hardcore fans that are not interested in the surround sound, blue ray, etc..? Why hit us with yet another reworking of the iconic cover we all love, when we would prefer to hear what remains in the vaults.Then I come to an understanding... Why? Because Mason needs another new vintage Italian sports car. Not surprising that he needs a second drummer to ghost for him on the rare occasion he bothers to play the kit.Question answered."
1,Music Only a Critic Would Love,"Wow - what a disappointment. I grew up in the 60's and 70's, but I had forgotton how much of this pseudo-intellectual, banal artsy [stuff] there was out there. This is an album that the critics then and now believe was some type of a wonderful breakthrough album that was supposed to have lifted the level of rock music (or whatever) - actually it stinks. If you are still lost in the 60's you'll love this - if you have matured somewhat in the meantime - it will seem like it goes on forever and ever with mindless nothing. It has a couple average cuts on it - in reality - even in the early 70's - if this album had been cut by a less well known and less politically correct band it would never have seen the light of day. Spend your money on something else."
3,super duper,"Pink Floyd's magnum dopus. If super duper hits is what you crave, head on down to Pink Castle and get a 12 pack of Floyd burgers."
2,Get Led Zepellin,"Pink Floyd is by all means original. But if you're new to them, hear them first. You either love them or you hate them. Personally, I don't see why they're so highly esteemed. They've got a good beat, but I am always disappointed after I listen to a song and never catch the riff. Great songwriters ( Beatles, Rolling Stones, LED ZEPELLIN ) get a beat and work off of it. Pink Floyd just sort of dicks around and never gets interesting. Their singer isn't my type either- he doesn't have the energy of a real rock and roll band.I realize that millions of people love this band, but I'm more into music than most people anywhere- I listen to Rock, R&B;, Metallica, Techno, and Classical... and I don't recommend Pink Floyd- but I wouldn't dissuade you from listening to him, as expanding musical taste can never do harm. Just make sure you know what you're buying."
1,Pink Floyd are the most overrated bunch of hack artists EVER!,"This has to be one of the very WORST albums of ALL TIME. I would rather be forced to listen to every single moronic Ocean Colour Scene album than EVER EVER EVER have to listen to this pile of aimless something or other. IT GOES NOWHERE!!! It is just one big pointless experiment in being 'cool' or 'experimental', Scissor Sisters do a much better version of Comfortably Numb than 'the Floyd' could ever hope to do...and I guess they should have tried to record this big mess of an album. Total rubbish."
5,A milestone of rock music,This is a milestone of rock music. This is one of the best LP (or CD) of all time. Music as well as lyrics is simply fantastic. And this new SACD sound brings long forgotten quadrophonic version of the album back to your ears. For better sound some drums and bass guitars had been recorded anew.
4,Production Power,"This album was incredibly produced. It has lush guitars, great lyrical content, and excellent throaty vocals. I recommend this album to anyone that enjoys great rock with a splash of progressive. The only reason I don't give it a 5 star is because it can leave you feeling gray and flat after a few listens. Definitely something you don't want to put into your regular rotation or play at a party when you're trying to pump things up."
5,The greatest album of all time,"What hasn't been said of Dark Side of the Moon? An album that is truly timeless, each song flowing into the next to form a sonic journey which will never bettered.Pink Floyd have created other masterpieces, but what makes DSOTM so special is that it was created by the entire group at their peak, and so draws from the strengths of each member. The result is a fantastically balanced and varied work, and yet one which carries a strong theme throughout.If you only own one album, make it this one."
2,Pretty dull,"This album is very dull and depressing! All those sound affects are designed not so much for sonic innovation, but to distract from the rather dull and ordinary songs. To me an all time great album has to have good song writting as well as good lyrics, and quality performance. My top 10 albums in no particular order are:1)Let it Bleed (Rolling Stones) 2)Revolver (Beatles) 3)Innervisions (Stevie Wonder) 4)Rubber Soul (The Beatles) 5)Arthur (The Kinks) 6)My Aim is True (Elvis Costello) 7)The Velvet Undergroud (The Velvet Underground) 8)Free Wheelin Bob Dylan (Bob Dylan) 9)Who's Next (The Who) 10)Hunky Dory (David Bowie)"
2,The Kids Are Alright,"Wow, the most fascinating thing about this album is the reviews it has garnered from ""the kid"". I'm assuming it's all the same person who has so obviously had such a visceral reaction to this album. Kudos to Pink Floyd for creating ""art"" that has motivated people to react in such a way. Personally, I think the Pink lost it after Syd. One star for ""Money"" (great record) and one more because it isn't The Wall."
2,Does not hold up over time,"This disk simply does not stand the test of time. For example, the echo used on the Us and Them vocals is over produced. Also the song Great Gig in the Sky amounts to nothing more than a bunch of screaming and lacks any direction what so ever. The songs Brain Damage and Eclipse especially have lost its appeal. ""All that you touch....."" seems dry and just lacking in anything thay can be taken seriously. During the ""High School"" days this was very stoney. But now it amounts to little more than overplayed FM dribble. This music simply tries to hard to ""freak out"" the listener. Real music that holds up after 30 years or so is usually not so overproduced, but instead has strong, straight forward song writing."
4,a sure-fire classic,"While this album is not on my list of desert-island discs, and not even close, it is easy for me to see the appeal of it. It appeals to classic rock fans from all generations by expanding that genre incredibly without getting too weird. The Wizard of Oz thing also increases its mystery and analog depth. The phrasing is not the best, but it doesn't matter here. I do think, though, that the fans of this album should go buy ""Piper at the Gates of Dawn"" to see where this music was coming from in a purified form which I think makes it superior to ""Dark Side""."
5,The Music is Timeless and Knows No Bounds,"For every fan of this magnificent quartet this album inspires a different view of the same strange vibe. How could an album recorded over 30 years ago, remain so pertinent to every generation of music lovers? I can only sum it up in the following words... My parents love it and they're in their 60's. I, of course have grown up listening to it played on the radio and on every jukebox during my bar hopping days. And now my son at 3 years old can't seem to put it away. Requesting to listen to it every time we get into the car for a trip to a store. The music needs no explanation as it is as beautiful as it is complex, and every person who has ever heard a song from this record ends up buying it for their collection. A new generation has discovered this gem and I for one can relate to the first time I heard it and still have it in my repretoir of cd's I play without and end in sight.The sound is clean, the music is awesome, Thought I'd something more to say..."
5,Amazing.,"I purchased this album felling fairly doubtful about how good it would feel. I am so glad that I did. This album creates a beautiful peaceful, yet sad atmosphere it is amazing. Just close your eyes and listen. And they throw in time and money, in the mix of sad and beautiful which are both good normal rock songs. This is the kind of album that you get for the sole purpose of listining to it from start to finish, because otherwise its just not as good. For some reason this album perfectly describes the whole atmosphere of the american midwest to me. Its amazing. You can also do the whole wizard of oz thing with this album which is pretty cool too. Buy it, it wont dissapoint."
2,Disappointing,"Look, before you get mad at me, I'm 42 years old. I've heard this recording on Vinyl, 8 track cassette and CD. The CD is flat. Oh sure the songs are still great, but there is nothing there for sound quality. Very disappointed, Alan Parsons did not want this recorded like this."
5,STILL FIRST IN SPACE!,"How many bands can say that their work has been sent out beyond the stars? Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon was included in NASA's VOYAGER space craft program in the mid 70's. The project was a high level sort of time capsule which included photos and sounds of every human language, place on earth, technology, animals, etc. Voyager's primary mission was to journey beyond our Solar System in search of life.If picked up or intercepted by any life form, NASA included very primative instructions to construct a phonograph to play the round disc that included all of the sounds discussed above. That disk also included music as one of many mankind creations. The music included on that disk was the entire recording of Dark Side of the Moon.Voyager is now well beyond any human contact and is basically predicted to ""voyage"" on forever. Or maybe not!"
3,Good. Different yet real good music.,"This is my second favorite Pink Floyd album. There were two problems I have with this album. One is that alot of the songs are too long and draggy. The other one is that it was a Roger Waters controlled album. I know he did most of the writing, but what I mean is that the other memebers of Pink Floyd got in on the writing too. I think when that happens the songs aren't as good. that's just my opinion, but I the think the whole album is pretty good."
3,What's the fuss about ?,"I just can't understand why the whole world rates this as the greatest progressive rock in music history. When I heard this album about 15 years ago, I couldn't care less, and I feel the same way too today. Not that I'm not a Pink Floyd fan, I own 12 of their albums ! I mean the Dark Side is devoid of any good melody, doesn't drown you into that ""moody, dark, mother-nature like, peaceful yet gloomy"" relapse. Not like those in Atom Heart, Wish and Animals. I can't even remember any good tunes, except for ""Money"" which is still played to infinity on the radios. There are some good ones though, Breathe, On the run and Time (the best), but the whole album just doesn't jive in. While it's still a ""good"" album, I wouldn't say it's the best. I would rank 1st, The Wall, then Animals, Wish, Atom Heart, Piper, Early singles, More, Saucerful, DARK SIDE, Meddle, Obscured, Momentary and Ummagumma."
5,One of the Greatest Albums of All Time.,"I am not a great Pink Floyd fan, in fact this is the only cd of theirs that I have but it is intense. Do not be droned out by the music, listen carefully to the lyrics and wait for the interplay between bass, drums, and guitar. Time is the best song. It is so true. Also, the album is filled with little lessons in life. (""All you touch and all you see is all your life will ever be."") Really fantastic work that ranks right up there with Zep's ""Zoso"", and other great albums. Definately worth it."
5,The Quiet Desperation,"Quite possibly the finest album ever put together, from all standpoints: musically, lirically...not to mention breathtaking engineering. This is Floyd at the top of their game..evidently, the whole was much, much larger than the sum of its parts. Listen carefully, this is not ""just"" Floyd...it's God."
3,A little bit of everything,"I don't really need to review the album, if you're a fan you're going to buy this anyway. Still, it seems that the music label and I don't share the same view of what should be called ""High resolution"", but it certainly isn't any lossy format. Still, offering the surround mixes on DVD as ac3 and calling that ""high resolution"" is just a slap in the face. They should have made one of those DVDs a DVD-A for those who don't have a BR-Player. As it is, the set feels pretty ""meh"" to me."
1,Really bad sound for a great album!,"Got it for Xmas! I wouldn't have purchased myself since the reviews here at Amazon seemed really bad. But, it's all true! The sound on this record is very poor and full of noises. I have an old copy that has been trough a lot and the sound is clearly superior. There're a few extras and mp3 downloads but the vinyl itself is crap. Don't waste your money on this one, invest in an old used copy and you'll probably have more fun."
1,This is no surprise!,"This started many years ago with vinyl releases of Division Bell and ever since, the US recordings on Vinyl arent worth buying! Save your money and buy an import or better yet get a ORIGINAL sealed vinyl pressing of DSOTM and other Floyd albums! They still sound better than all the old CD versions until decent remastering came along in the late 90's and 2000's!"
4,Disc 2.,"I enjoyed both discs to this new set, but I wish a bit more thought had been given to the packaging of this and the entire ""Why PF?"" campaign. I actually won this set, brand new, through a contest, and right out of the shrinkwrap, there was some pretty noticeable dents on the inside of the album. Plastic inlays would have fixed that issue.Overall, not the best, but a very nice product, music-wise."
5,Winner winner chicken dinner,"I remember a time when I heard the name Pink Floyd and just laughed. I had no idea what they were about but I didn't think I would like them. Fast forward a few years.This is the fifth (I believe, could be more) time I have purchased this album. This is my first mp3 download, but fifth (I believe) overall purchase. CD's get scratched, lost, stolen, broken, etc. I can't get enough of this album, as I have listened to it 1,000's of times over my life. This is a classic album - period. This is one of the best musical pieces of all time, regardless of the genre.This is timeless. This is classic. This is music. If you have never heard their music, buy this album. If you are curious, spend the few dollars and become a fan like millions of others. The only thing better is seeing them live, which none of us have done for a few years now. The best we have now is replica bands (Aussie! Aussie! Aussie!).Buy it. 'Nuf said."
4,The Floyd,"More please! This would have been absolutely astonishing with more music around more interviews. How did ""Live at Pompeii"" play into ""Dark Side?"" David Gilmour's studio work is better than most bands' live performances. Wish U Were Longer!"
2,Not good,"I have both the original LP and the first issued cd, both sound much better than this remastered POS, don't buy it I just wasted my money on it !!! I have an Ayon Triton II, Sonus Faber speakers and an Accuphase CD, a good enough system and a good ear to be able to tell apart a good well mastered cd or lp from crap, this is crap. Too many sounds effects, sounds dull and compressed. This is bordering on heresy, taking one of the better LP's in the history of music and killing it is simply unacceptable."
5,A great test album for the surround sound,"If you never had the album. buy it for your surround sound. If you owned it, you know what it is capible of. Put it this way; if this sacd disappoints you, take the surround sound back the store and forget it. The music takes you on a trip from the beginning to the end. A very good chill out album after a rough day at work. Pop the top off a cold one, and take the phone off the hook.. that's all that needs to be said. ;-)"
5,"Timeless, Classic, Untouchable","Dark Side will forever be a great record without a doubt! Every new generation of teenagers will hear this and be blown away by it's originality as compared to current music. No band since this has put together such a creative effort and i doubt any band will ever come close....esspecially with the sad direction most popular music has taken. Also check out ""Wish you were here"", ""Animals"", ""Meddle"", & For the newbie ""Echoes"""
2,weird,"The disk came covered in a white residue. The cd case was falling apart, and the disk seemed oddly floppy and made sounds in the drive when I played it."
3,Dark Side of the Moon,"Most of the MP3s were OK. A couple of the songs were bad and had momentary dead space. Other than that, it was nice to hear this music again."
2,"Great Album! But the fidelity just isn't there,","In a word... whatever. The Original Master Recording by MFSL is far better than this. The SACD formatting - to me ear - provides too much information and compromises the ambient naturalness of most original recordings. The resolution is too high, unnaturally high, and causes most of the higher frequencies to be abrasive. I played it on my hi-end system: Arcam FMJ DV139 source player, Arcam FMJ AVR600 processing and amplification, B&W 805s speakers, Velodyne SPL subwoofer."
5,Acually hear more going on than I have for the previous 30 years,This release has opened up a new listening experience. I have worn out several LP's and a few discs of DSotM over the last 30 years so I can say I know this album. This recording has reopened my ears because of either new sounds included or just ones that were previously burried in the mix are more prevalent. Everthing sounds more alive and closer in the room than any previous releases I have heard.
3,Good but not as good as the original.,"Floyd have always been a mystery to me. And I don't mean their sound. Rather their appeal. They are competent songwriters and musicians. And Dark Side Of The Moon is a good album. But there are many greater in the history of popular music. They aren't in the same league as the Beatles. And their sound called space rock, was done earlier and better by the greatest ever guitarist Jimi Hendrix. Listen to 1983 (A Merman I should Turn To Be) from Hendrix Electric Ladyland album. And tell me in all honesty Pink Floyd weren't influenced by this song immensely. To the point they have virtually based their whole career around its sound and adventurous structure. They are good at what they do, but space rock wasn't invented by them, or done best by them."
5,Simply a masterpiece,"This album is absolute sonic perfection. Truly an assault on the senses, track by track twisting into something horribly beautiful. I'll never understand the sad lonely little people who give albums like this a negative review - get a job/hobby/signifigant other and leave the computer alone. Seriously, youre not funny and nobody is laughing. How sad. Back to this cd, and the fact that you absolutely must own this... if youre wondering, you owe it to yourself. You wont be dissapointed."
5,One of the best albums ever!,"No matter how many times I hear this album, I continue to be amazed. Anyone that says this album is overrated needs to have their head checked. Amazing."
4,Overrated but still awesome,"I think Meddle is a better album, but this is the album that everyone will remember Pink Floyd by. And it's better than most bands will ever put out so it's hard to fault it. Anyone who likes rock probably ought to add this to their collection. There is a reason why this is one of the top selling albums of ALL TIME. It is a monument of rock - almost anything Floyd was ever involved with was."
5,Unreleased Awesomeness,"For fans of sex machineguns this is a must own. This is a compilation of unreleased tracks and it is a great mix of heavy and light tracks. Tracks 2,3,4,7, & 10 are pure awesomeness. These are better than a lot of the original album tracks. If you like classic metal, like judas priest, or you just want to hear great rock music, sex machineguns are the way to go. I recommend the album barbe-q michael first and then either sex machinegun, heavy metal thunder, or this album."
5,A British Sitcom! Not a Nature Film!,"Oh, where shall I begin!? This is not a nature film, it's a 70's British sitcom, well, sitcom doesn't do this justice, it is a comedy series about a bored housewife with two teenage sons and a husband, played by the same actor who plays Lionel in As Time Goes By. I think he collects butterflies, but it has been ages since I saw this program, and the videos are exceedingly difficult to find. I have seen them popping up on EBay, for about 14.95. I tried to purchase a copy twice, but both transactions fell through. Also beware that when purchasing VHS tapes from the UK, check to see that the British VHS format is compatable with the US video players, most are not.Anyway, this is one of my Mom's favorite shows, showing a neglected housewife and mother, who meets, by chance another(dashing-ish)man and he spruces up her self esteem and her life. A thoughtful comedy, if you can get your hands on it!"
1,WARNING - This tape is not about butterflies.,"WARNING - The description of this videotape is inaccurate. It is not about butterflies. It is a segment of a television situation comedy. The description shown is identical to the description for a number of other things that are supposedly about butterflies, so those other items may also be mis-described. END"
2,Amor - N. Dessay,"I'm sorry to say that I did not enjoy this CD. When I was listening to the songs from Der Rosenkavalier, all I could think of was: she doesn't have the voice for this - her high notes seem a little thin to me. I realize taste is subjective, but Lucia Popp, Theresa Stich-Randall, Kiri Te Kanawa, Renee Fleming all do much better interpretations of those songs. This is the first CD I've ever heard from her - and I don't want to judge her by this CD alone. I'd say try another CD by her if you've never listened to her before."
1,Poorly done,"I have not read the books, so I don't know if it is just awful material to work with, or an amateur job on the film, but it is a complete waste of time."
2,This is not a Documentary!,"If your desire is to learn more about Tibetan Culture, then this is not the most aproppiated product for you. I recommend you to buy a guide about Tibet, e.g. the Lonely Planet one. The Tibetan landscape is only a complement to the music, not the opposite. Tibet is a beautiful place, and you will find beatiful sceneries in this DVD, but you must be aware that this is not a Documentary, this is a way of traveling through music."
3,Just ok,"I didn't like this product, the lace top was uncomfortable. It seems to me that this was designed for a really thin person. I thought the material was more cotton."
3,Why nylon,"I bought these panties about 20 years ago, IN COTTON why oh why are they only made in nylon ? it is sticky in the hot weather and very unhealthy to wear.I still have my cotton ones, just about, they are so thin they are invisible nearly.these panties fit properly, don't ""ride up"" don't show under tight trousers, don't know you are wearing them. I won't buy any more though because I hate nylon underwear.Please Bali, make them in cotton again and I will order a boxful, I know a few other women that would as well."
1,bali lacy skamp brief,"I felt like I wasted my money buying this product. The quality is so inferior, I wonder if it would survive a washing. I do not recommend it."
1,very tight waistband,"The panty is nicely made. The elastic at the leg is comfortable, and the lace at the waist is pretty and soft. But the waist is so tight and uncomfortable! I own other Bali panties in the exact same size as the ""Skamp Brief"" (who makes up lingerie names?!?) and the waist is more than an inch bigger. I'm glad I bought only the one pair--I won't be wearing this item."
3,Ladies underpanties from Amazon,"These are very nice underpanties if you have a straight shape, but if you are a little thick around the middle, they will roll down. For that reason, I returned them."
2,fabric quality declined,"I have purchased this product for at least 20 years, and the quality of the fabric has declined terribly! Very thin and transparent compared with days gone by. Very discouraging."
2,not what was ordered,This product must have been an older model that is being passed off as the newer one. The whole reason I loved these was because of the slip grip no ride up feature on the panty and it was replaced on the sent item with old school elastic that doesn't quite measure up. Very unhappy with this purchase. :(
4,The Redwyck Charm,I enjoyed reading The Redwyck Charm. As a historical romance it was a fast and easy read that I would recommend to anyone.
3,OKAAAAAAYYYY,"part of a cute series of books. nice to read, not a wild stretch of the imagination....oh no, you want more words..."
4,The Redwyck Charm is very charming,"As a followup to 'The Incorrigible Lady Catherine.' Elena Greene continues her 'three disgraces' series with a charming book, 'The Redwyck Charm.' Both Marcus and Juliana assume disguises so that they can follow their dreams, if only for a short time. Of course, sensuous chaos ensues. I especially liked the hero, Marcus. Miss Greene also has a good sense of the regency period and blends her plot seamlessly. I cannot wait to read her next book with Penelope. I can only assume the hero is bound to be the infamous Lord Verwood. overall, another great story from Miss Greene."
3,Glitz is not enough,"The pity of this release is that the presentation is a luxurious marvel and can hardly be bettered. Also, everyone else is at their best; except, of course, the conductor. I do not take to Nagano's conception of the piece which, to my ears, sounds lame and boring. When you hear Stokowski (in 1951 mono!), Horenstein (in fabulous late 1950s stereo!) Solti (1970s) even Inbal (1980s) you can understand how conductors such as Nagano and Rattle are the result of an overhyped, adoring media. Alas, it has happened before (e.g., Karajan). But history will take care of that."
4,"Outstanding lyrics, they tell a story you can visualize","This guy is really special. He tells stories that put you in a place and time. Billy's music is intelligent, fun and keeps on giving you new things to think about. This guy has star power. Really special new artist"
5,wow,"I recovered this CD from a pile of my brother's old ones when he moved out. Billy Mann is by far one of the most talented and emotional songwriters and musicians I have ever heard. I can't believe that it's out of print. His self-titled CD is also amazing. I'm particularly fond of ""how do I say goodbye,"" but the entire cd is a gem."
5,Lucky find,I love this video & am having transferred to a dvd for ease of use. I am so glad I was able to get it again as my old copy got lost.
2,Precision Sculpting - dissappointing,I think the workout is rigorous but the tape is too slow. After the first 2 or 3 times viewing the tape I did not need her extended explanations. I found I was waiting for the next exercise which made it a tedious experience.
2,THE PAINFUL THRUTH (WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW)(RATE ME!!),"i BOUGHT THIS TAPE, AND WAS SO EXCITED, SO i PUT IT ON AND FOUND OUT THAT IT WAS NOTHING OF WHAT i WAS EXPECTING, SHE STARTS TALKING EXPLAINING THINGS YOU ALREADY KNOW AND THE WORKOUTS ARE VERY BORINGON THE BACK IT SAYS:PART 1- UPPERBODY 15MIN. WORKT USING LIGHTWEIGHTS FOR ARMS, CHEST AND SHOULDERS( THESE ARE THE SAME ROUTINES YOU KNOW THAT IS ON EVERY VIDEO WHICH IS NOT WORTH ITPART 2- 15MIN. WRKT FOR LEGS, BUTTOCKS AND HIPS ( AS USUAL THE SAME THINGS YOU ALREADY KNOW THAT DID NOTHING FOR ME I DIDN'T FEEL ANYTHING IN MY LEGS THAT MADE ME FEEL THAT I HAS A GOOD WORKOUTIN CONCLUSION THIS ARE THE SAME WORKOUTS YOU HAVE IN ALL YOUR OTHER VIDEOS THIS IS JUST MORE OF WHAT YOU ALREADY HAVE--I AM A BIG FAN OF JENNIFER KRIES BUT I WAS VERY DISAPOINTED WITH THIS WORKOUT IT JUST WAS NOT CHALLENGING FOR ME AND MOST OF THE WORKOUT SHE SPEND TALKING INSTEAD OF WORKINGOUT AND THE WORKT WAS SUPER SLOW WHICH GOT VERY BORING--"
1,Don't bother buying this.,This video was so awful that if I could have rated it zero I would have. If you haven't moved in years and are just beginning to think about trying it again don't try this video it will put you straight back to sleep. I can't think of anything I own which is more useless.
4,Precision Toning delivers in a very different way,"Precision Toning is a very refreshing approach to exercise. In an easy to follow (although not so easy to execute) program. Jennifer walks you carefully through the movements that are fairly simple, but very effective. I have noticed lengthening of muscles, greater strength and flexiblity. It seems that you can continue to be challenged by this video for quite a while. This video focuses on abdominal strength and overall flexability. My only complaint is the length of the video. An hour is a bit too long for me."
4,Simple and Works,"The Scosche single DIN kit for the 2006 Hyundai Sonata is just that, simple and works. Its not terribly complicated, same as all other install kits. It installs with the screws from your factory radio, and works well.keep in mind, no aftermarket kit, unless custom fabricated, will ever be a 100% fit, and this is about a 97%. There is still a few mm gap at the bottom of the DIN underneath the radio, but you never notice it with the faceplate on.Use it, it works."
5,Very good quality,VEry god quality telephone cable made from cat 5e twisted pair wire (instead of standard flat tele wire). Good shielding. Definitely a must for dsl users to use form their wall jack to their modem.
1,Can't get it right,"I ordered an RJ-11 cable for my DSL modem from Ucable.(#28721) This cable is designed to reject interference from various outside sources. The first one they sent me was just a standard RJ45 network connector which of course would not fit into my telephone jack. They have just sent my replacement which is just a standard telephone cable I could get from my local Radio Shack. Buyer BEWARE with this company!!!!! Their employees apparenetly can't even read product codes before shipping!!! I will pay the extra $2.00 and order the cable I wanted long ago from the original manufacture (Cables to Go) a great company. Shame on me for trying to save a few bucks, order from Amazon and not from the people who make the damn thing."
1,Must Have High Speed Package to Work !!,"I ordered this phone cord because I noticed that businesses and public libraries using broadband phone cables for high speed connections, but apparently for home users you must have the total high speed materials installed for it to work. My internet connection is still the same as it was with my narrow phone line no different, except for not being disconnected as much. If you want high speed connection just chalk up the extra money to have some company hook it up for you, doing it yourself will not WORK !!"
4,How to teach your baby to swim,"I like it a lot, but I don't think I will apply the method. I go to the swimming pool with my son and he's almost 3. He wants to have fun and is not interested in doing any of the exercises for more than 1 minute. And it's a kiddie pool, because in that Summer club the kids have to be over 3 to go to the deep pool. I will be joining the YMCA for his swimming classes and of course, I will put in practice her advice to listen to your child so he trusts you and not force him, but that is just common sense/maternal instinct: I wouldn't force my son to get underwater if he doesn't want it.... What I really like was the foreword: I hadn't heard of Glenn Doman and now I got all of his books about child development."
3,"lots of detail, but too fussy","My son received this for his 3rd birthday along with some of the other coordinating sets. The detail is incredible and accurate to the movie, but I would not suggest this for kids under 5. So many of the pieces are tiny and others are fragile. The instructions on how to put this together are fairly easy to follow for an adult, but you may need an extra set of hands. I haven't tried it in water, so I don't know if it actually floats. He does enjoy playing with it, but often needs help when something comes off.Not a bad toy, but not really appropriate for the 3-year-old set."
2,Disappointed in the Quality,"I bought this item for my son's 3rd birthday. He absolutely loved it and it really does do a lot of things, HOWEVER, it completely fell apart in one day. Captain Hook's head came right off and when I tried to fix it, it broke into about 7 pieces. The masts refuse to stay on and the doors won't stay closed. The box says it floats but it sinks in the tub. It's a shame because it was very cute and a great idea but it should have been better quality. I would buy it again if they would improve the design and materials."
3,Not a lot of story but some funny stuff,"There are some rather slow parts in this film and it could have used more music. However, it is a fairly fun ride with a group of people trying to combat a bunch of bugs which have grown much larger than any bug should be.If you like a blend of horror with silliness and some gross comedy thrown in, you might enjoy this."
4,Better than I expected,"Giant bugs? Usually thats not something that catch's my attention, to be honest I dont know why I bought this, but I'm glad I did. There are some, bad CGI parts, but you soon forget them because of all the comedy relief moments. For some reason, this movie was for the most part believable, with a few exceptions. But funny, enjoy!"
2,"Could Have Been Great, If Not For The Ending!!","I loved this movie! Great B-Movie fun with a great cast and then it got to the ending, and it was ruined by a cliffhanger ending. I listened to the commentary at the end of the film and the director talks about the ending he was going to do and should have done, then goes on to say he hates how directors end films hoping for a sequel and that's what he does, but worst of all, ends with a cliffhanger. This film would have been so much better if it had a real ending!!"
4,THERE WILL BE BUGS,Surprisingly effective giant bug movie with good effects and a wry sense of humor. Christopher Marquette makes good work of his role as the geeky antihero while Ray Wise is perfect as his military fanatic father. The low budget thriller doesn't look cheap and has a great musical score. I haven't decided about the ending but it's admittedly courageous.All in all a pleasant surprise.
2,CREEPY CRAWLIES,"NEVER HEARD OF THIS MOVIE BEFORE UNTIL I SEEN IT AT A FRIENDS HOUSE. HAD TO HAVE MY OWN COPY FOR MY MOVIE COLLECTION. THIS MOVIE IS ENTERTAINING, FUNNY AND A LITTLE CREEPY IN SOME PARTS."
1,Do not waste your time!,"This movie was terrible. Everyone on this board who gave this film a positive review must have been paid by the makers or involved in the movie somehow. I rented this film with very low expectations. It being such a low budget film, I only anticipated a good story...... but was disappointed. The story is terrible. The acting is terrible. The effects are terrible.The biggest disappointment was the story. I get ignore everything else if the story at least made sense. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME! I rented it for $1 and I want the time I wasted watching it more than the money!"
5,Simple Fix for What I Needed,"It seems like such an effort to get this feather-light item shipped to me to finish the job of installing my SATA 1TB drive, since getting it at a local store would have been much quicker and involve less ""energy"", it would seem. However, I honestly don't know of any store (mom and pop OR big box like Best Buy) that would supply such a cable.I was a little leery from the description wondering whether it would be exactly what I needed. I needed a power adapter to transfer from an LP4 female connector to the back of a new SATA hard drive. This was exactly what I needed - I was happy when I opened the package and saw the male LP4 plug, just like the picture showed. Yes, it *is* 6'' long so be sure you don't need more length than that before you commit to buy.I would recommend it, but then again if it ""fits"" your need, then it would seem there's really nothing much that could go wrong."
1,Loose wire on arrival,"How could anything go wrong with something so simple? For me it did!One of the four wires connecting to the white plastic connector was disconnected on arrival. I pushed it back in and it managed to work. However, it finally gave out after several months, and I had to order another one.For something so cheap I did not bother go through the troubles of returning it."
3,sata power cable,This item is ok ... it would have been better if it would have given a one to two connection coversion.
4,Rapid Page Turner,"A good book, a catchy story, but after reading Altman's first novel, ""A Gathering of Spies,"" this novel almost seems like a romp, written quickly and with far less twists and credible turns. In fact, at the end, Eva Bernhardt's 'sudden' awareness that the Gestapo had set her up with false information to take back to England feels like an anticlimax. Nevertheless, it is a gripping quick read and worth buying."
5,WWII spy thriller,"Although I'm not generally a reader of World War II nazi spy stories, a friend whose judgment I usually trust recommended this author#s work very highly and lent me the book. I was hooked from the first chapter and could hardly put the book down. I can't judge the historical accuracy of the book, but in terms of interesting characters and complex, fast moving plot, this book was intriguing and well written. I give it 5 stars!"
1,Believe the few negative reviews,"I've been reading espionage novels and thrillers for over forty years now and ""A Game of Spies"" is a lackluster effort unworthy of four or five stars. The main characters are poorly developed and uninteresting. I began to hope they'd be nailed by the Gestapo just to bring this thing to an end. Come to that, the secondary characters, who Altman has the irritating habit of never giving a first name to, are just as lifeless and flat. Finally, many thriller writers have done a much better job of bringing WWII-era Europe to life. I suspect the author got as bored writing this book as I did reading it."
3,A good spy book,"i liked his first novel much better, but this one is pretty good, it reads fast, pick up a copy one quiet weekend and enjoy it."
3,flawed plot,"""A Game of Spies"" was a page turner with many flaws. It made no sense to me to have William Hobbs as a spy in Germany when he only had a school boy's knowledge of the German language. That really spoiled the book for me. He wins all his many gun battles with this old rifle that he even acknowledges was off kilter. He has serious wounds to his leg and manages to make it half way across Germany. The plot premise is good but it isn't developed well. Beyond all that I did enjoy the book."
2,:-(,"All 6 pairs were itchy enough to be distracting during a run.On the bright side, I didn't have any trouble with the seams.I tossed these on the top shelf of my closet and bought a 6-pack of balega running socks, which are great."
2,"Okay for bikers, not for runners","These are very light weight socks, but they are intended for biking. For running, the toe seam is too thick for comfort and will chafe right at the knuckle behind your toe nail. They are okay for walking, or gym work, but not for any exercise that involves foot strikes. Despite the light weight, they are no less hot after exertion, and there is no wicking effect as there is in higher quality running sock."
3,More like a collection of hymns...,"Than a cohesive, well composed, work or mass. The recording and performance are excellent. So, if you like the music, by all means, go for it. Just don't think you're getting something on the order of the Rutter Requiem or a piece by Vaughn Williams."
2,Color issue,"The only problem I have with this product is color. On the product details they show 3 different colors (I think it was yellow, green, and blue), but don't give you a choice - which was fine. However, when I received the product the scissors were pink. I have an 8yr old BOY. I am not going to send him to school with pink scissors."
1,Useless,"This is amazingly useless. The black light is nice and attracts bugs from all around, but the zapper is so weak, the bugs crawl across the wires with no harm done. Piece of junk."
3,How do you change the bulb?,"This is a handsome rechargeable battery indoor bug zapper which does work as an indoor bug killer. The problem is that it is a sealed unit. I purchased two units and within two weeks the bulb burned out on one unit. I can find no instructions on how this bulb can be changed. Without the bug-attracting light, the unit simply does not work."
1,Third Exterior Makeover,"This unit is in its third exterior makeover, but the guts to the system are the same. Bulb life is less then one year, and the cost to ship it back to the vendor exceed a new purchase price. We tried putting a new bulb in it, and it did not work, so was trashed. Guess they think that if they make a quality product, no one will purchase a second one. Such a waste of what could be a very nice item. We are working with modifying it to work with LED lights."
3,"Works okay, but no replacement bulbs","I've had pretty good success with this unit, using it indoors in a city apartment that doesn't have a lot of mosquitoes, but enough to make them a nuisance. It's not perfect, but it gets most of the bugs. I put it in my bedroom bathroom and it doubles as a nitelight.The problem is that I can't find any replacement bulbs and the last one I owned lasted only one season and the one before lasted for two seasons. I would have bought a different kind, but I don't like the way others look for indoor use. I'll probably keep buying this unit until they come out with a model that allows you to change the bulb and looks good, but if you don't care about the looks, I'd encourage you to find find a different model that allows you to replace the bulb.If anyone figures out how to replace the bulb, please let me know!"
1,WEak,"The UV light is so faint that it will attract bugs only if there are no other lights on that they can be lured to. The zapper only creates 2000 volts which sounds like a lot but only the smallest bugs are fried by it. The grid was designed to let in only small bugs and is hard to alter, but I did it with a diamond bit. Then some bigger moths got in there and just played around all night!"
2,after needing my 4th one - I'm switching brands,"I have a gnat problem and these work well but they dont last, seems like the more they kill the shorter the bulb lasts. A few weeks at best when it's highly utilized."
4,Sunbeam Bug Zapper,"You have to purchase a product with what you need in mind. This is an excellent product for what I need. NoSeeums (Sand gnats)dearly love me. They never bother my husband or daughter, just me. They are so tiny that they slip through the screens or any pin hole. They even bite me in the bed under the covers. This zapper gets them all. They are attracted to white and to light. The only problem is that you cannot replace the bug light and it burns out in about a year. You have to send it back to the factory which costs more than a new one. I just wait until they go on sale at CVS and buy a new one. It has never caught anything but sand gnats that I know of but this suits me just fine."
1,Paper weight,"This thing was a waste of money,in the time that I have had it,all that it killed was 2 UFO bugs,and added to my electric bill,I would NOT tell anyone to buy this."
1,SUCKY,"OK, I got this item at Borders, and I was so excited at the time, because I thought it was a DVD, with really cool HIM footage. I get home, pop it into my DVD player, and then I hear this woman talking. It's not a DVD. It's boring as shit, throughout the whole thing, this woman just talks about the band. It's hard to follow along with, and I got bored of it after listening to it for about 20 minutes. I completely lost interest. It feels like you're in class hearing the teacher drone on and on in a monotone voice. If you're a HIM fan, just get Love Metal Archives, the Singles Collection, the Video Archives DVD from 1997-2003, or just simply wait for the new album by HIM called Venus Doom which is to be released on September 18th in the US.And, by the way, the woman even pronounced Ville's name wrong. She said it like this: ""Vill"" or ""Veal"", it's actually ""Vill-uh"""
5,A very real example of the thoughts and concerns of children,"This is a story of a little girl whose grandmother has died and she has to travel with her family for the funeral. It takes her through the stages of wondering what it is like to go to the funeral home and to see her parents and grandfather going through some of the grief. It is a very realistic approach to way Americans approach the process of grief. This includes the funeral home, the cemetery, and even a consolation breakfast.This book allows the child to see death as a real part of life and allows for the discussion of death with children. They will see how even when people are sad they can still laugh, remember, and talk about the person who died. It helps the healing process.Excellent book for young children."
1,HORRIBLE!! WAY TOO GRAPHIC FOR A FIVE YEAR OLD!,"My five year old checked this book out of the school library. Way too much for a five year old. Discusses listening to grandpa cry, touching grandma's hand - and it was COLD! Children playing capture the flag in a room full of empty caskets??? I thought this book was terrible and am fighting to have it removed from the school library.Probobly OK in the right situation...not just a leisurely book to check out from the library for the heck of it..."
1,Ghost Stories,I don't like ghost stories. And if you believe EMILY OF NEW MOON would be good because of the author Montgomery then you will be disappointed. This is not the Montgomery you would have expected after reading the books. This series is not from the hands that brought us ANNE OF GREEN GABLES and ROAD TO AVONLEA! This is from somebody called Marlene Mathews. This series loves to engage in the paranormal; Emily always see dead people in all but one episode.
2,Disappointed,"I own ""Anne of Green Gables"". I was hoping this would be as good since it was the same author. I was very disappointed. Managed to watch the entire series, but would not watch it again, as I have Anne. Too much ""ghost sightings"" and she was always screaming and running after someone or something. The characters were not true to the time frame. The younger girls acted too young for their characters age. When Laura became pregnant, she was pregnant for two years! I would not recommend this series."
2,Disappointed,"Seasons one and two were fantastic except for last episode, which unforunately carried onto 3rd and 4th seasons. I'm very sorry I wasted money on the following seasons."
4,"Once a fan, always a fan","Being slightly disappointed by ""Lovechild"" and ""Second album"", I wondered if I should buy another Curved Air record. Finally, I decided to get this one. Well, I have to say that this is a very good album, equally fine as their debut ""Air conditioning"". ""Airborne"" continues with the jazz-rock of ""Midnight wire"", but on a more melodic and less pretentious note. The playing of the band (once again featuring drummer Stewart Copeland who also co-wrote some songs) is tighter and more engaged. Without getting trite, the music flows like a well-oiled machine. The delicate pop song ""Desiree"" leaves you wallking on air for the rest of the day. Other standout tracks are ""Kids to blame"", ""Hot and bothered"", and ""Baby please.."", but everything here is good, even the 11-minute megawork ""Moonshine"". Unfortunately, this album failed to chart and Curved Air soon disbanded after its release."
4,Interesting,"I found this topic to be interesting. I'm not sure that limerence doesn't fall under other categories, but it's interesting to read this take on this topic. Worthwhile read, never-the-less."
1,Worthless,"I read the book 'Women Who Love Too Much' which suggested this book as a reading. It also stated that this book would make you not be so crazy in love again. All that Dorothy Tennov did in this book was put what other authors have written. She put others people's stories in there, and repeated herself over and over again until she hit over page 200. I am very disappinted in this book, and wish I had never read such a useless piece of material. It gave no help to anybody, only confusion, and a boring reading experience."
2,less good than i had remembered,"I had first read ""Love and Limerance"" 25 years ago, and remembered it as being a fascinating book because it described ""limerance"" (a word which the author made up herself) as that heart-pounding excitement when one first encounters a love object. Accordingly, I ordered 3 copies (one for myself and two to offer to therapy clients.) However, I was able to get through only 1/2 of the book before laying it aside (and determining to donate the other 2 copies to the library) because after it makes its [very worthwhile] point in the first 25-50 pages, it repeats and repeats it to death."
5,Original and meaningful,"I had this book when it first was printed. It gave me a new word to use to descripe the mania you feel when you first become so attracted to someone that you can think of nothing else. It really isn't love, although you think it must be. It's painful and obsessive. It makes no sense. It's out of your control. Well, the word Limerence is meant to describe the whole feeling. I mistakenly loaned the book to someone who never returned it. Today, just to see if it could still be found, I searched on Amazon, and here is a new printing! I'm eagerly ordering it."
4,Seger Struts,"Bob Seger & The Silver Bullet Band changed their sound a bit for the release of 1980's Against The Wind. While the album included songs like the great ""Her Strut"", ""Horizontal Bop"" and ""Betty Lou's Getting Out Tonight"" which are rockers in the classic Seger vein, much of the album takes on a country tone. Having co-written The Eagles' number one hit ""Heartache Tonight"" which has a country rock flavor, Mr. Seger follows that course on the album. The title track is a lamenting song that has a somber tone while ""You'll Accomp'ny Me"" is a pretty and longing. The best song on the album is the powerful and foreboding ""Fire Lake"" which Eagles Don Henley & Glenn Frey return the favor by lending back up vocals. Against The Wind become Mr. Seger's one and only number one album and spent six weeks at the top."
4,Classic Rock,"This album was always my favourite Seger album. Includes hits such as 'Against The Wind', 'Fire Lake' and another that should have been a huge hit ""Betty Lou's Gettin Out Tonight'. For some unknown reason, 'Fire Lake' wasn't included in his greatest hits collection. Great sax on several selections and vocal backups by the likes of Don Henley and Glen Frey. This remastered version has none of the flat sound of the origional nor are the highs ultra sharp. Great remastering job on a really wonderful disc."
5,Bob Seger Against The Wind,"Bob Seger's Against The Wind, to me was his best work yet, the music is fast pace and to me there is a certain sincerity to the songs almost as if every song was a experience, I changed from listening to nothing but hard Rock, to Bob Seger, at the time it was a great transition, for I absolutely refused to listen to DISCO. Against The wind is a fantastic Album I would recommend to all who like to get caught up in there music. I originally owned all of Bob Segers music, but this album remains my favourite."
5,Against the Wind,"This album is a must have for any Bob Seger fan or for anyone who enjoys Rock and Roll. Their albums are hard to find any where else and a friend of mine told me totry Amazon.com and I'm glad I did. Along with Against the Wind I also bought Stranger in Town, and Live Bullet by Bob Seger and the Silver Bullet Band two more great albums."
3,Polished Seger,"""Against the Wind"" has two classic Bob Seger performances, the title track and ""You'll Accompany Me,"" both ballads. The rest of the album is a bit of a letdown after the two great previous albums ""Night Moves"" and ""Stranger in Town."" The more rocking material seems particularly bland, with songs like ""Her Strut"" and ""Betty Lou's Gettin' Out Tonight"" just not measuring up to the high standard that Seger had set for himself. ""Against the Wind"" is not a bad album, it is just a lesser one from an artist capable of much better."
2,Seger's album is OK but not the best and a favorite here!,"Only a couple of songs that's included on my Bob Seger's Greatest Hits CD from ""Against The Wind"" to ""You'll Accomp'ny Me"" I like by him!"
3,***1/2 - typical Bob Seger,"Typical in the sense that Bob Seger's albums almost always include a number of excellent songs and a handful of forgettable ones as well.""Against The Wind"" is the last of Seger's ""classic"" albums. Originally issued in 1980, it features one of Seger's very best ballads, the simple but superbly melodic ""You'll Accomp'ny Me"", as well as the slow rock of ""Fire Lake"", the title track (another ballad), and a couple of grinding rockers, most notably ""Betty Lou's Gettin' Out Tonight"" and ""Her Strut"". And then there's all the filler...bland, formulaic numbers like ""Long Twin Silver Line"" and ""The Horizontal Bop"" (honestly!).So, as is the case with most Bob Seger albums, this one is mostly for hardcore fans. There's a lot of good music here, but all of it is available on Seger's two ""Greatest Hits"" albums, and the best of the best is on the superb 1981 live album ""Nine Tonight"" as well."
5,THREE FOR THE PRICE OF 2,"HAVE BEEN USING THIS MOUSE FOR THE LAST 8 OR 9 YEARS, ON THREE COMPUTERS.JUST HAD MY FIRST ONE GO BAD. THE PRICE WAS GREAT FOR THREE.NOW HAVE ONE FOR COMPUTER REPAIRS AND ONE SPARE. GREAT PRODUCT."
5,excellent book,"It is an excellent reference book for the Cmos designers and wannabes, it is a very easy follow through and has very detailed examples, very good."
5,"Go West, Young Reader","Damn, this is a funny book! Sorrentino subverts the Western novel with a ludicrous tale of hunting for gold narrated entirely in interrogative sentences. Reminiscent in some ways of the boys' novel parody in ""Misterioso,"" Sorrentino has a field day with the traditions and lingo of the Western, as well as going off on riffs concerning contemporary culture. Throughout, Sorrentino interrogates our use of language, especially our reliance on cliches; a linguistic hygienist, Sorrentino questions any sloppy misuse of language, knowing that sloppy language can lead to sloppy thinking. The Western genre has attracted many innovative writers--Coover, Brautigan, Kesey, even William Gaddis wrote a Western screenplay, unfortunately never produced--but Sorrentino's inquisitorial contribution is the funniest."
2,FOR THE BIRDS,"After seeing this film at least 6 times in 45 years, I keep coming away disappointed. First, Taylor's acting is subpar and Hedren's is positively terrible, almost statuesque. It's as though she were reading Kipling's ""If"" for women before every scene. Only Taylor's mother seems to have some idea of acting. Secondly, the plot is ridiculous, unless I'm missing some sort of symbolism of mother nature rising up against man for all the harm he's caused to wildlife. If that's it, then why simply a local outbreak? Next, where is Bernard Herrmann? Perhaps, Hitchcock decided that a film lacking background music would be more effective, Strike three! Finally, the last scene with the birds quietly sequestered and our protagonists heading for a San Francisco hospital, leaves this reviewer with an empty feeling. Paying good money to stare at the cinematic equivalent of viewing a museum painting for 2 hours is just not my cup of tea. I'd rather sit and watch the grass grow."
3,Good points were overshadowed by Paglia's sexual immaturity,"I'm a big fan of Hitchcock and have read a lot books about his films. The Birds is my favorite of his films. Paglia made some interesting observations and pointed things out that even die-hard fans may have missed. Still, I got tired of Paglia's sexual immaturity - every scene between two family members was ""all about incest"" and every object whose length is longer than its width was a ""phallic symbol"".They really should have assigned this task to someone who's not an adult still stuck in the early phases of adolescence. Pity. Such a terrific film deserved to be taken seriously and not be used as a canvas for an overrated and perverse mind such as Paglia."
1,Clinical,"If you like music with your work out this is not the DVD for you. We know what muscle groups are getting the work out, but my enthusiasm for the work out gets burst by the dull instruction."
3,Whoops,"I thought I was getting the bands, my mistake probably when I looked closer it did have dvd written rather small I think but anyway guess you will get another sale now that I have the dvd and not the bands.Thanks Deb"
2,Very good idea in a not so great book.,"I likes the story of this book. It had a very big potential. Unfortunately, I was quite bored by it not long after I started reading it. I took a break and picked it up again some weeks later and finished it, not so much because I wanted to know what would happen but because I don't like leaving books unfinished. It has glimpses of humour and good writing but most of the time it's quite uninteresting and I never goot a good mental picture of the action.Those who are interested in Hubbard may want to read this short novel, but it's not a very good one. I don't recommend buying it at full price."
4,The Perfect Traveling Bible!,"This bible is just small enough to take with you everywhere, and still contains the same inspirational message as regular size King James Bibles. I have found it truely helpful when daily life presents a problem, and im not at home to look at my regular bible,i always keep it with me wherever i go!"
3,Beware never know what you will end up with!,"This is a great product, but my husband does a men's Jail Ministry & when we received this Bible it was a very pretty girly pink. It would have been nice to know that we were not getting the actual Bible pictured. It would have helped us to order the correct color. We tried to wrap the front & back cover in brown postal paper, but the Jail Administration would not let us give it to the inmate because it had been altered. It was considered contraband in its altered state. So just be careful & ask questions when you order. You never can tell what you will get I guess."
3,Foux Leather?,"I was looking for a new bible for church... when i found this i was excited to get it. the description said the cover is foux leather, but this is glorified plastic...the bible itself is great as is all of God's word, it has Red Letter which I was looking for. the pages are a pretty thin... and a plastic cover. it will get the job done for the price."
3,Print is too small,"The New King James is a great translation and this is a beautiful gift bible; but for those of us with older eyes, the small print is a bit much."
5,Great for ages 11-21,I love this Bible its the best all though its not real leather it is very durable .. and it is very easy to keep up in suday school or bible study.. I am so glad i purchased this bible.!!
3,Caption not quite right.,"With the 4-for-3 promotion these are a good buy, but buyers should be aware that these Bibles are NOT leather bound, but rather imitation leather. These are just your standard award NKJVs. And the covers are purple. But they are still a good buy."
5,Prodcut again in excellent condition,"The product purchased, (RVR 1960 Gift and Award Bible (Black Hardcover)) is a bible of good material, medium point, in very good condition. The product delivery was made without any inconvenience in the stipulated time. Thank you very much. May God bless you."
5,A very good cover and the whole book itself,"The cover is very nice, and the pages are of great quality. Very good price for the item... I would recomend buying this if you want a nice Bible in Spanish."
2,No merece la pena,"Es una edición barata y como tal está muy mal encuadernada. La mía llegó rota, venía rajada por la parte que se une la tapa a las hojas. Además estaba sucia, casi dando la impresión de estar usada. Aparte de eso, el texto por algunas zonas está borroso y cuesta leerlo. No la recomiendo."
3,Good movies - Marred by serious DVD flaws,"I love Bond movies. And this set contains some of my most favorite Bond movies. But to my disappointment I found many mastering errors on 3 of the DVDs in this set. ""The living daylights"" and ""Octopussy"" have missing footage. ""A view to a kill"" has the title song missing. ""Never say never again"", which is not part of this set, has an entire scene missing. MGM is not recalling the DVDs sent to retailers, but they are issuing fixed DVDs to people who send e-mail to them at 4you@mgm.com free of cost. You have to send your discs back to them by UPS and they will send the new repaired DVDs free of cost.Apart from these problems, the DVDs have good clean anamorphic picture free of grain. The audio is adequate but not stellar."
5,Bond.... the best!,"This third boxset contains not the best Bond films, but (we all know) the Bond films are the best! One thing that amazes me after watching various LDs and DVDs in my collection, is that one consistently returns to watching Bond, even after years of absence. They are supremely well made (how many movies have their own dedicated studio and special effects/stunt etc. teams? Are there any such competitors? ), and basically are the best, however much one compares between the films and highlights relatively small differentials. The long duration of the films alone - usually with several genres per film - makes them good value for money. Bottomline, this is a must-buy for any DVD collector."
1,Disappointing!,"As others have said in this and the other Bond Box reviews, I'll say it again. Greedy! I was unable to get the original ""Volume 3"" before it was discontinued. So I have an incomplete set. I was dissapointed to learn in order to complete that set I would have to order Volumes 2 and 3 of the new release. All I can suggest is that if your looking for a James Bond Collection, be sure to buy all three volumes before this happens to you."
3,Go ahead and complete your set,"A mixed bag but worth having:Thunderball - some good scenes but I'd suggest you either read the novel or watch the first Austin Powers movie.On Her Majesty's Secret Service - very faithful to the novel and one of the better Bond movies. Good fight scenes, but still not sure about Lazenby.Live and Let Die - an intense movie where Bond uses his wits to survive long enough for the showdown, then the gadgets save him. The movie probably has held up better over time than the novel (even with J W Pepper), but the novel gives more motivation for the villain.View to a Kill - weak (but hot) heroine, boring fire engine chase. Otherwise a watchable flick. Great performance by Walken.Octopussy - best title song of the series! Plenty of eye candy and good action.Die Another Day - taking Bond in a new direction? Didn't care much for this movie the first time I saw it, but seems to get better after you get over the CGI effects."
2,Why should I not wait 1.5 more years?,"When the dts-remastered versions of all the Bond films come out in 2005 with more features? They're being remastered right now.Ever wonder why Die Another Day and The World is Not Enough, good DVDs as they are, didn't include deleted/extended/alternate scenes? Probably because they're part of the rereleases."
