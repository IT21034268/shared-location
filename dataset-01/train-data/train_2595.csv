3,Simplistic workbook aimed at psychology undergrads,"I came across this book by accident and ordered it due to the strength of the online reviews. However, had I had a quick browse of it first I wouldn't have.I expected a serious attempt at systematically categorizing fallacies in thinking. What it actually is is a very rudimentary workbook for undergraduate psychology students that introduces some common failures in reasoning in a very simplistic way. For that purpose it may be fine. If you have already done much thinking or reading in this area you are likely to find this book dissapointing, and in a number of areas surprisingly naive."
4,How I rated Hageerty Silveer Foam,"I used it on several pieces of old jewelry and one beautiful silver vase. So far so good. I have used the paste for so many years, I'm out of touch with the liquids.So, until I've tried it out on other silver I'll not use the word ""love"" yet."
5,Best silver polish,"I've used Hagerty's silver foam polish for years on my sterling flatware. It is by far the best on the market -- easy to use, safe for one's hands, and gentle for one's silver."
4,"Great product, packing problems","Like at least two other reviewers reported, my shipment of this product arrived spilling intp a plastic container bag around the jar. The caps are not being put securely onto the jars sometime before packing. The spillage lost maybe 6-8 ounces and was a bit of a pain to cleanup, but not worth trying to complain for credit or return it. The remaining 12 or so ounces will probably last me a couple of years, and there's nothing wrong with the jar when the lid is secured tightly. I don't see how this could happen. I deducted a star for this.The product itself is very good. I used it to clean silverware. It is gentle, brings out a great shine, and doesn't seem to leave any residue.I also use theirSilversmiths' Silver Wash(which, by the way, arrived with no spillage issue) on decorative silver. It is also good, but it contains some sort of protectant tarnish inhibitor that it leaves on the silver, so I wouldn't use that one for dinnerware."
4,The only brand my wife will use!,"One time, I bought another ""new & improved super silver cleaner"" for cleaning our silver.It did not perform as well as this Hagerty paste that we had always used before. Cleaning silverware is a thankless job, but Hagerty makes it a little easier."
1,This product is no good,"I bought this product because I wanted to clean my silver necklace. The package says that it is supposed to remove all tarnish, however after soaking the necklace in the foam for literally an hour I managed to remove just a small portion of the tarnish. The necklace looks a little bit shiner but I would not say it's a noticeable difference. The foam is just a baking soda paste and I think there's no need to pay 6 dollars to get baking soda delivered to your door. Very disappointing.Clarification. After I got no results from vehemently rubbing and lathering the product on for about 15 minutes I decided I might as well dip the necklace inside the container and leave it there for a few hours. After more rubbing and lathering the results were minimal. It might be safe for gemstones but it doesn't really work for silver."
5,useful for cleaning all sorts of things,"I bought this product to clean some silver jewelry items, which it did just fine, but who knew that it could also be used to clean old cupboard hinges and non-silver jewelries too? We used this product on all sorts of metal surfaces and it did a great job! It's easy to use, washes off with water, and doesn't smell too bad :)"
5,Best stuff ever!,"Seriously - don't waste your time with anything else. This is the only stuff I've ever found that cleans silver. Amazing. Works really well for anything that's been exposed to sulfur, too."
2,VERY POOR Packaging,This product was completely spilled in the packaging.What a mess!! I sent a comment when this happened but as yet have not recieved a response.I certainly won't order this again.It is too bad because this is the first bad experience that I have had with Amazon.
3,Not as the reviews promised,The reviews were pretty great for this product and I was a bit disappointed. It seems to work if you scrub REALLY hard but its so messy.
3,interesting,"I had expected something a bit different with this book -- I thought it would focus on the Brearley experience and lifestyle. Instead, it really concentrated on the girls' lives after prep school. It was interesting to find that many of them faced problems like anyone else would. Although this book did describe the experience of attending Brearley, it did so in the beginning, and then followed how its traditional education left the women unprepared for the rapidly changing society of the 60s and 70s."
5,A Lesson Learned,"I think Rosemary Wells wants us to know that we need to keep our dogs safe. In this story, McDuff is in his chair listening to the voices he loves, when he sees a fat rabbit. He chases after the rabbit. He gets lost. He feels scared. He wants to go home. Read to see if McDuff makes it home safely...Austin H."
4,A Smart Dog,"In McDuff Comes Home, McDuff learns a lesson, not to chase rabbits. One day McDuff saw a rabbit and he started to chase it. His collar came off. Then he fell asleep in a garden. When he woke up he didn't know where he was. You have to read this book to see if McDuff gets home. I liked this book because I learned you need to keep your dogs in a safe fenced area...Paige B."
5,McDuff is not a Yorkshire,"I just wanted to point out that the synopsis of this book says that McDuff is a Yorkshire. He is clearly a West Highland White Terrier (""Westie""). Whatever you call him, though, McDuff's stories are wonderful."
5,...LOVED this Rosemary Wells book!,I am a 2nd grader...I have been reading books by RosemaryWells. My favorite book is McDUFF COMES HOME. I loved the part in the book when McDuff went over the fence and saw a rabbit.
1,VERY DISAPPOINTED,"SAID IT COULD HOLD THE SIZE GARBAGE CANS WE HAD, BUT COULD NOT. WE HAD TO GO OUT AND BUY SMALLER CANS, THAT STILL DON'T FIT WITH EASE."
4,"Easy read, interesting and informative","This book was needed for a special education course, but there is a new edition/version of this book out that I was required to purchase for the course. I made the mistake and bought this version. The newer edition has chapters in a slightly different order and more example lessons, but there is supplemental information on this book online by the publisher including questions to make sure that you are understanding to assist anyone.I would recommend this edition or the newer edition of the book."
5,Great thriller,"Book ""The Quiet Assassin!"" written by Thomas Kirkwood is a great thriller. The plot is set in the heart of the Eastern Germany police state and it features an interesting heroine named Kate. She is a resistance fighter but at the same time she is a wife, a mother, a scientist, and a lover. She is equipped with wisdom, but also with pen and paper. Such combination became her essential weapon in her transformation into a quiet assassin.The author did a great job creating all of the characters, and at the same time, keeping the plot interesting while building up thesuspense. To me, it seemed like a giant, live game of chess. At the beginning, chess pieces were set on the board, and it was interesting to follow the plot and discover how the author's sentences move the pieces around the board. Tactically, it was a very well played game. I really enjoyed reading ""The Quiet Assassin"", and would recommend it to anyone seeking a novel full of action, romance, and suspense."
5,The Quiet Assassin,"The Quiet Assassin was an excellent thriller. This book took place in Germany during the fall of the Berlin Wall. Kate, a mother and a wife, is also an assassin. This book gives everyone hope that they could live an exciting and a normal life. It was a very suspenseful novel that kept me guessing what would happen next. I really enjoyed reading this and would recommend it to those who want edge of their seat excitement. This story makes me wonder what life would be like to live it as two different people. Definitely five out of five stars."
1,No scent at all,"I got three votives in macintosh and vanilla, after buring for an hour, there is no scent at all. Not sure if there are defective or expired. Won't repurchase again."
1,Won't draw attention outdoors,"This alarm is so shrill that it won't attract attention, for example, in a parking lot. It's loud in a closed-in space (inside a car), but the high frequency dissolves outdoors and wouldn't help."
1,Piece of junk,"Item did not work right out of the box. Cheap piece of junk. I used two different, new 9 volt batteries. It didn't make a difference."
1,Very disappointed,After receiving this product I tested it and everything was in working order. The next day it broke. The pin wouldn't turn the siren off. It just kept ringing.
2,Alarm wont work with belt clip,"With the belt clip used, when you pull on the cord the whole device slips from the belt and no alarm goes off.I would think with little modifications this could have been designed better.For a emergency device that is not acceptable, the manufacturer needs to redesign the holder."
5,Loud as Hell!!!,"As a word of advice, wear earplugs when testing this gadget! This thing is loud as hell. If this is not enough to deafen and scare a burglar away then I don't know what will. I hooked this up to every single door we have in the house. There is no friggin way someone can open a door (when armed) without me hearing it. Definitely alot better than paying a security company a monthly fee. I give this 6 stars."
4,very loud security,"hadnt used until i got to rio , was with a friend and decided to show him how loud it was , so i pulled the pin gave it a blast, and went to put the pin back in but it wouldnt stop the alarm , so there iam one street of copacabana in rio , with this alarm against my stomach going off. We went to a key cutting booth and got a screw driver to open the alarm to disengage the battery , then i threw it in the bin , i still have the other one in my bum bag , not sure wether or not to pull the pin , incase i cant stop the thing"
4,"The Arado Company, Beginning, World War 2","The book was very interesting but focuses mainly on the history of the corporation with actual documentation copies. It has an excellent section on each of the aircraft from World War 2, their beginning, versions, cancellations and other data. I enjoyed the book because it had information on some of the aircraft that information is difficult to find like the Ar240 and 440. The pictures were okay but minimal, but all in all it was a very informative book."
5,I absolutely loved this book!,"The story is about an English widow Juliana who was unwanted by her dead husband's family and her own family and how she found love with a Scottish Laird ... the only one who ever wanted her. It's a beautiful, touching story, I've read this book a dozen times and I never tire."
5,Wonderful story!!,This author never disappoints! Loved the characters and the rich historical detail.
3,I LOVE LINA,"Hey, I admit it--I'm a Lina Inverse mark and proud of it.As for this volume of SUPER-EXPLOSIVE, things start off with a bang--literally--with a classic manga hot springs episode. And as you all know by now, any hot springs episode has to end with everything going awry-if not actually exploding-- which is what exactly happens!This book starts tying together the mega-intricate SLAYERS plotline, but it sure doesn't skimp on the over-the-top comedy. Lina and Gourry also have excellent rapport.The humoungous plot shouldn't scare you away if you haven't experienced SLAYERS before, because the wacky artwork and the ridiculous situations are the real jewel in the crown with this series. And if you've seen the anime, you'll get a real kick out of seeing extra details that they couldn't fit into that series.Check it out!"
3,Graphic SF Reader,"A lighthearted comedy style story it appears. A young female magic user travels with some companions, including an impressive swordsman. She mostly wants to laze around in a hot spring and have fun, but demons, a priest with dodgy motives, and a dragon monster get in the way.Some of the lines could be straight out of The Tick :-""You Thugs. Prepare to taste the succulent fists of justice!"""
1,"Conversations with ""myself""","Walsch holds the belief that we are all part of the divinity that is god and our purpose is to remember that we are god.So, if we are god and Walsch is having a conversation with god then he is having a conversation with himself!!! This explains Walsch's moral relativism. For Walsch morality is relative, there is not a right or wrong, there is no sin and Jesus was just another teacher.This book and his others are NOT Christian nor Biblically based, they are New Age philosophy.Christian readers should avoid this book and others written by Walsch."
1,Conversations with god (emphasis on small g),"If you are a teen or a parent of a teen looking for a book that will help explain who the God of all creation/the God of the Bible is, then this book is NOT for you. If you would like to know who the god of this world is and how he has twisted and distorted the truth of the Word of God, then this book seems to flow right in line."
1,Not my God,"The God that the author talkes about is definately not the God that I serve. If you want to get deceived then by all means buy this book.Just one verse from the God I know (Matthew 18:6 But whoever shall cause one of these little ones to stumble, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he be drowned in the depth of the sea.)Those are strong words, and I think that could include people that promote this book, not just the author.If you want the truth then read the word of God.(The Bible)BEWARE!!!!"
1,Conversations with Neale Donald Walsch ?? Bad advice!,"Conversations with God? No, more like converstations with Mr. Walsch who thinks he is God, but doesn't know any thing about the Biblical God. If you want a book for your teens on life matters, open up the bible and sit down with 'em, read it together. The book of Proverbs is a great place to start and there is one for every day of the month."
1,Not for Christians!!!,The title of this book is would have one believe that it is actually conversations with God. IT IS NOT! It is conversations with a god...the god of this world. It sounds great but is definitely not a Christian book and should DEFINITELY not be bought for your teen if you are a Christian.
2,NOT for Christians!,"I picked this up at a thrift store for my 15 year-old son, without reading it first. Fortunately my son read it on a long car trip, so I could hear him say things like, what a load of crap!and this sounds more like a conversation with Satan!So, I asked to see the book and I was shocked! This is definitely not written from a Christian perspective. Relative truth, situational ethics and man-centered views abound. My son disliked the book so much that he tore it up and threw it away!"
5,"BANNED BY FUNDAMENTALISTS, MAKES THIS A MUST READ!","All you have to look at is how many fundamentalists have giveN this book a negative review. This will make you want to pick up the book. If you believe in a loving God and want answers to the hard questions this is for you. Yes Mr Walsch says you are OK, Especially if you are a gay teen. PLease read all the negative reviews and then see what all the fuss is about, but this book."
1,Which GOD?,God has already written a book. It's called the Holy Bible. Which god wrote this book? Mr. Walsch should not be so deceitful.
1,Does truth exist?,"It is clear to me that Mr. Walsch's conversations were not with the holy God.No one should read this book with the idea that Mr. Walsch has some ""inside connection"" to the sovereign God. In John 14:6, Jesus said, ""I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me."" NIV"
3,???????,"This boook provides a lot of ideas and concepts, logically explaning some of the order and entropy in human moral, values, liasons. Numerous remarkable 'uncommon sense' ideas are exploited, too. Several ancient philosophical concepts are also modified to the current world society.It is highly recommended for people who are interested in philosophy.The Theory of Knowledge: Knowledge is neither created nor destroyed."
1,Who Cares?,"Who cares about the content? This book was just poorly written. What God would talk like that? Didn't this book have an editor? Doesn't God know proper english grammar, or how to write in such a way that doesn't put the reader right to sleep? I don't know of any teens that have an attention span long enough to read a book this boring. The only redeeming factor is the intro by Alanis Morisette, allthough I don't know many teens who even know who she is, and even less who think she is cool! In the words of one teenager ""this book is like... so 2000"""
1,Good questions - Very bad answers,"Create God in your OWN image instead of the other way around. That way you can justify and rationalize away any behavior or faulty mindset. If you think your teens are confused and disillusioned now, give them this book to really push them over the edge. What they need is truth that lasts, not the ""flavor of the day.""Do you want answers from God? Try these eternal truths: Genesis 1:1, Isaiah 59:1-2, Matthew 3:17, 4:17, John 1: 1-5, 3: 15-21, 3:36, Luke 24:7, Acts 2:8, Romans 8-12, 1 Corinthians 13, Colossians 3: 1-17, Hebrews 10-12, Revelation 22: 12-17, and many, many others.Your teens need more than ""I'm OK Your OK"" platitudes. They need love and guidance. This book is not the answer."
1,Not like any 'god' I know (and the 1 being very generous),"Walsch couldn't be further from the truth about his 'god.' As a person who has grown up in a Christian household, the fact that Walsch refers to his 'god' as Jehovah-Lord is quite irritating. If you're looking for a religion where there is no accountability to anyone, just what ""feels good"" and ""what works"" then this book is for you. If, however, you're looking for a true religion that actually requires discipline, then turn away. Walsch is a tree-huggin' new age-ist who is trying to justiy his 'god' as the eternal Lord. Frankly, this book flat out disgusted me. Walsch contradicts himself by stating that ""there can be no up without down"" and ""no right or wrong (just what works and what doesn't)"" but there can somehow be a Heaven with no Hell? Gimme a break..this guy just wants to give everyone a ""warm fuzzy"" while at the same time trying to make himself into a theologian. This books is horrible."
1,No Truth Here,"You have got to be kidding!! This man knows nothing about God (big G) nor the truth! This book will NEVER be on my library shelf, nor will I recommend it for reading by anyone I know. Blasphemous and totally in error. God's Word certainly does not agree with this poorly written book of lies."
1,horrible book,"This is a horrible book to give to ANYONE, especially someone still forming his/her values. I would not want to be the author who has answer for this content someday, or someone who has given this book to a teen."
1,Did man create God? Or did God Create man,"This book is bad - I am not sure where this persons information comes from. The god discribed in this book is not the God of the Bible. This god was created by this author, not by truth. The advice given in this book will be harmfull to anyone who is seeking TRUTH. This is not Gods view. God is Holy and calls us to a standard that is His, not mans. Teens: If you want answers to what God has to say about stuff, read the Truth. The BIBLE!!!"
1,This is not a coversation with my God.,"You know, I suppose it depends on who your god is. This certainly is not the God of the Bible. ...P>For any person looking for a good devotional for teens, this book definitely is not it. My God is a Holy God, very much different from the one this author professes. BEWARE! The title is very deceptive."
5,****Best Book : Must Read*** Will Change your Life for the better,"This is one of the best books ever written. It changed my life in amazing ways for I was no longer a sinner worshiping a wrathful and vengeful God who may condemn you to hell if you do not obey his commands. Instead I now love a very caring and loving God. I feel now more free and more responsible and happy in my life.I very much recommend that every one read this book. It will present you ideas which are quite interesting.The core message in this book is that God is not a small minded fearful or wrathful God who is sitting on a big golden throne willing to send his children to burn in hell. Instead, Walsch suggests that God is an all caring and loving God who loves you UNCONDITIONALLY.N-Joy."
1,So Sad,"It is so sad that something like this is allowed to be out there for our teenagers. I am a youth group teacher at my church and I am a Christian. There is only one God, and He answers our questions through His Holy Word, the Bible. This book needs to be done away with. It is nothing but deceitful and a lie to all who read it. I am also apalled that Oprah would promote such a book. There is a right and there is a wrong. Our children need to know this. I gave this book one star only because I had to so it would show my review. I actually give it nothing because that is what it is.....nothing."
1,Conversations with Neale Donald Walsch,"I am not sure why Walsch thinks he has the authority to speak as God. This book is way off. If you want to have a conversation with God, pray. Talk to him like He is your best friend, because He wants to be. Don't read a book by someone who thinks he has it all figured out, because none of us do. If you want written advice, read the Bible."
1,God Bless This Man!!!,"All I could think when I heard about this book was complete disbelief. I had to come to Amazon to see that it really existed. I can not believe that someone would actually write something like this and put my Father's name to it. This was an eye opening experience because I have a teenage son and now I will be sure to screen what he's reading even if it has God's name in the title. Satan is a horrible ugly liar, but thank God he loses in the end. Hallelujah!!!"
1,teaching immoraliy,"The author writes, ""There is no such thing as right or wrong and that is what I have been trying to tell everyone."" If that is the moral stance you want your teenager to take, this is the book for you. Think about it for a while. What would the world be like if we all decided to live as though there is no right and wrong?"
1,What God is This?,What God is Walsch talking to? I have never seen any religion with such a liberal carefree god. If you are getting this book for a teenager to help them with their spirtual growth in every day problems this is by far one of the worst books I've seen.This God basically says do what ever you want as long as you are okay with it... it doesn't matter to me. This seems to be a better book for rapist and murderer's because it lets everyone off the hook.
1,"Good idea, but the execution... :(","Great concept for a book - the teen years are ones that are full of all kinds of questions. The problem becomes that when writing a book that gives the 'God' side of a conversation between God and a teen, you better be really careful what you have God saying. And after browsing the book before giving it to my teen, I came to the conclusion that God sure had changed a lot from the one I read about in the Bible. Presuming to be able to speak for God is a big undertaking; Idon't think the author was up to it. Or at the very least, the author's opinions just don't match with mine - 'God' comes off as a very hip, new-age kind of being.My advice - browse the book before you buy it to make sure your views ( that you'd like to present to your teen ) agree with the author's."
1,Parents Beware,"Parents must beware that this author's ""god"" is a subjective new age god of his own imagination that is partically amoral, not the GOD revealed in Scripture. Mr. Walsch, speaking for his god, will answer a young lesbian that she was simply made that way (like being left-handed or blue-eyed) and go celebrate your difference (...). Mr Walsch promotes promiscuity, that living together before marriag is okay with this little god. He also advises impressionable, young minds that there is no need for forgiveness because there is no sin, no wrong anyone can do that needs forgiving. This author is dangerous for young, impressionable minds!"
1,KEEP YOUR CHILD AWAY FROM THIS BOOK!!!,"This is completely ridiculous. Full of lies and inaccuracies. Do not put this book into the hands of your child. The dialogue is absolutely not Bible-based. Who in their right mind would tell a teenager that there ""is no right or wrong""??!"
1,Conversation with God-less,This book is obviously written by someone who doesn't believe in God -- it's just more liberal trash being thrown at our kids. Moral relativism is so trite -- as is this book -- total garbage.
1,NOT a Christian Book!,Just a few minutes ago I was flipping through the pages of this book and I could not believe the answers to the questions in this book. My assumption was this was a Biblically based book. Let it be known that this book is based on a miriad of theologies none of which have derived from Christian Biblical principles. Beware to parents who allow their kids to gain perspective or principles from this book.
1,Conversations with God for Teens,"The author decided what he wanted God to be like and what he wanted God to believe, and then created that God out of his own imagination and became his spokesman, putting his own words into this God's mouth. This bears about as much of a relationship to reality as a ventriloquist dummy does when he ""speaks"" at the behest of the one manipulating him. This book is simply the author's fantasy of what he would like God to be like, and he is in for a rude awakening when he meets the real God of the Bible and has to answer for how he misrepresented Him. The book is designed to decieve young people so as to encourage them into the most immoral kind of behavior. Do not buy it if you care at all about forming any kind of intelligent ethical and moral principles in your teens."
1,VERY DANGEROUS BOOK.......,"I agree with others, If ever there was a book that deserves a zero rating.. this is the book! I can't imagine putting this trash into the hands of any child or teen. The author, who answers the questions of teens as if he were God.. couldn't be further from a Christian. This is satin's work, folks!...."
1,a false prophet,"This man is akin to a cult leader, where he decides he has God's ear and is a mouthpiece for God. The things he writes are his own interpretations and would lead astray some impressionable teenagers."
1,Load of Cr*p. Ignore this book for the sake of your soul.,"Need I say more? Not only are these books the false doctrine of the devil, but in some instances quote (in error) the Word of God.And the list goes on. These books (and others like it) are being sold to school children through (The Scholastic Book Club), and we need to be aware of what is being fed to our children.Our children are under attack. So, I pray you be sober and vigilant about teaching your children the Word of God, and guarding their exposure to worldly mediums, because our adversary, the devil, roams about as a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour (1 Peter 5:8). We know that lions usually hunt for the slowest, weakest and YOUNGEST of its prey."
1,"Not Biblical, this is NOT for your Christian teen.","This book teaches things that are contrary to Biblical Christianity:- It supports Lesbianism- It teaches that there are no bad people- It teaches Pantheism and other New-Age beliefs- It teaches that God does not make judgements- It teaches that forgiveness is not necessary- It teaches that living together before marriage is not a sin against GodThis book is dangerous, because even though it has a Christian title, the content does not agree with Biblical Christianity. This book promotes secular humanism and other new age beliefs.As such, I would not recommend this book for your Christian teen."
1,"So, murder and molestation are ok?","A question asks about God's forgiveness of sin.His reply, ""I do not forgive anyone because there is nothing to forgive... There is no such thing as right or wrong and that is what I have been trying to tell everyone, do not judge people. People have chosen to judge one another and this is wrong, because the rule is ""'judge not lest ye be judged.""Um...no."
5,GREAT BOOK,"I just want to share what i think, first i think this is an amazing non religous book, the author is not having a conversation with GOD (the one the you all believe in)this is the god that we all have inside the one that we all want to believe in the one that could really change the world! this book says taht god is life itself and we all are life itself , so we are all god pieces of god , life is god.. we have created the world ( you should read some antropologist book as well) nothing exist without the meaning that we gave to anything without that meaning theres nothing.well i think everybody in the world should read a conversations with god book , specially teens , that way the world would be a lot more different.excelente introduccion by Alanis Morissette...the final part of the foreword it is just what we all would like to hear.really great book!why it is so hard to catholics and christians to accept? anything different? wel.. this book does nothing but accept ."
4,Great footnotes,"I collect stories to have as a resource. But the most important part of any story book is when they cite their resources. Ms. Frankel cites all the places she's seen a story: Citing midrashim and talmud. I haven't even started reading the stories, but I am already so excited. And there really are 300 stories in here! And the table of contents is also user friendly for choosing appropriate stories. In the back, it even tells you which stories are related to which parsha or haftorah reading! (The only reason I gave it four stars, is because I haven't read the stories yet... but I can't imagine that the stories won't be great)"
4,It works for me!,"Daz has compiled a collective of info that is essentially offered up on a lot of help pages. But, he has put it together in a very concise format. The spiral binding lays open without a hassle. The info about the ""deep Web"" is a new one for me and I found this section well worth what I paid for the book. This is an excellent resource for teaching groups or classes how to use the Internet for serious research."
3,Close But No Cigar,"I only gave this 3 stars, but one simple change would give it 5. The constellation lines are drawn in red. What's bad about that? Well, astronomers use red lights at night to preserve their night vision. Red light makes red lines invisible, so this planisphere is useless at the telescope where it's most needed. Changing the color to black would improve this by 1000%. As a result, this planisphere sits home never used."
4,My first shpere,"Many many objects available and so simple to use. My only regret is I maybe should have got the smaller version. The print is also quite small, but a good red light cures that. Extremely helpful for the newcomer."
1,Thumbs down,"I purchased the Firefly Planisphere Deluxe well over a year ago ""second hand"" from another individual on ""cloudy nights"" astronomy forum. It was received in excellent condition along with all of the original documentation as well as the folder and original shipping container.While this Planisphere is very large with a tremendous amount of information and capability the print size is so small it is barely readable even in bright light without a magnifier and totally useless to me as an aid for observing. Subsequently I purchased a similar product with far less stars and one inch larger in diameter. The other planisphere print size and color is much more suitable as a guide to the night skies for the beginning user.John"
5,Excellent Album,"Sorry to the above reviewer, but in my opinion, Dynasty beats any Black Uhuru recording outside of M. Rose days (although I agree that Now was the best Don Carlos-involved Black Uhuru album, then again it was not hard to top mediocre albums like Strong and Mystical Truth).Both Unification and Dynasty are the closest to original Black Uhuru sound that I have heard. With Brutal and Positive, it was still a good mix but nothing like ""Black Sounds of Freedom"", ""Sinsemilla"" or ""Red"". And then for several years, it was average stuff with the exception of Now.Outside of the three above that I mentioned from the M. Rose days, both Unification and Dynasty are terrific."
3,Nice Type Reference,"A very nice resource for type, style, and era. However, from an instructional or educational perspective it is essentially a picture book. It leaves me with plenty of questions regarding the entire subject area. But all in all it is still handy as a reference and was worth the price."
5,Mimosa- Rocks,"This album is the best- well done lads. I think that its slightly less upbeat than the last two, as it includes many schmoove versions of previous songs like 'scooby snacks'.However 'bomin' the L' and 'crazy train' are wicked- the song has to be 'shinning star'. This album really shows Hueys, Fasts and Mackies great talents to be so versitile in the different styles they adopt in each song."
1,Lamas is an idiot,"This movie sucked, why the hell was a non-breakdancer like Lamas cast in this? He can't b-boy to save his life. PLEASE save your money and time and avoid this complete turkey."
1,Body Yuck,Body Rock is the 2nd worst movie I have ever seen coming in right behind Meatballs 2. Lorenzo Lamas must wish everyday that this one would disappear. Dreadful movie.
4,Beautiful Picture Book,"This book is absolutely gorgeous and will provide lots of inspiration.What it won't provide is lots of words or step by step instructions. There are many close up shots of the very large murals which are helpful for discerning the details, but still not enough to be able to recreate it yourself, unless, as the book suggests, you've read his other book: Handbook of Painted Decoration.Beautiful book, but if you're looking for instruction, this isn't the one."
5,good reference material,"When looking for a book on trompe l'oeil, an art which is in itself a difficult thing to master. If you are a novice, look for book reviews where they tell you that it is a step by step manual. Then you will have a foundation and a valuable starting point to begin your artistic journey. Books such as this are basically good for reference material, the artist here is showing off so to speak his works of art, which is okay but if he or she offers no help in the way of instruction all you have is a pretty picture book. An author like Roberta Gordon-Smith is a better bet for the beginner. Janet Shearer offers good advice for intermediate and above. If a person praises it up and down and is overwhelmed by the quality of the artists work, that's just it...they are simply overwhelmed. The book in and of itself may not be that helpful. So read those reviews and try to read between the lines so you won't throw away your hard earned money. Best Wishes, Rick"
2,pretentious,"This book looks big and impressive on the outside, but inside, it is of very little use to the average commercial mural artist. I was very disappointed, especially considering the hefty price tag. Would not recommend."
1,Outdated and Worthless,"I was very disappointed in this book. The suggestions were out of date, not specific and the books not worth the paper it's printed on. The author should consider a new edition with real advice."
2,Not recomended,"If you want know about general use or MAs, run away from this book. I'm still looking for a good one, but definetly this one is the worse.It gives some good clues about using MA, specially for trading futures, but nothing say on stocks.The pattern suggested by the author is based only in his intuition and experience, but not in any structured theory."
1,Not recommended,"I bought this book thinking it might be about the general use of moving averages for trading. It is not. The author describes a single setup opportunity which he describes as happening very rarely. This book could be of some help to people who trade multiple markets using daily charts. To those who trade only one or a few markets this is not for you. I am not going to say this doesn`t work, but most traders I believe would be disapointed with the book, due to its very narrow scope."
2,Not a leading edge indicator,"If you are looking for a leading edge indicator this might not be your best bet....Moving averages are lagging indicators and by the time you get into some of the moves you are getting in after a lot of people are already in making it a high risk proposition.Also remember that moving averages do not work well in sideways markets as they can whip-saw you a lot. This is definetively not suited for daytraders or for stock traders as it focuses on futures only. Most charts show ideal conditions and all charts dated 1995-1997. Markets have become more electronic based and have changed a lot since then....Overall, I think the author shows some interesting set-ups but a lot of them are already well known to professional traders who might tradeagainst this type of position.This is not holy grail...."
3,A would confuse trading system book,"Actually I like this trading system, coz it was very simple, by just using 3 moving averages.Problem is, the author didn't show exactly how to define the trend. Many times, I got trouble to know what was the trend of the weekly chart. May be the author assumed that all reader will be understand his thinking.I wish he could re-published this book by applying the 'dummies' way."
2,I read the book and I'm still not rich,It's just another system book and I've read most of them.There is no system to beat the market. If there were the market wouldn't work.If you'r just getting started in stock trading and want to read some systems then go ahead and read it but don't expect to find the magic bullet that will make you Warren Buffet.In any case if someone really knew how to beat the market do you thinkthey would sell the goose that lays the golden egg?
3,just ok,"not worth the money paid. the leather is not that durable. and unfortunately, after i was finally able to use it about 3 months after i bought it, i noticed it had a slice across the nose band. almost looks likea careless box cutter cut. i don't know if horses in australia are bigger, but i had to do some serious adjusting to get this to fit. and had to drill a new holes in this brand new bridle before i could even use it. the reins feel like really cheap leather as does the halter side of this. i fear that if i have my horse tied up from the halter, he would snap it right away. it's a shame too, because i thought the brand was trustworthy."
3,Not quite what I expected...,"I was looking for a CD version of the Jim Reeves classic album ""He'll Have to Go"" and found this. Since many of the songs were the same, I took a chance that this import was a repackaging of singles.It's not. These are live performances taken off the radio - in fact they sound like they might have been recorded off the air. The sound is tinny and the editing is a bit rough (some songs cut off suddenly during applause, but on another you get to hear Jim clear his throat after a song).After all that though, the album has its charms. The tracks are all live and Jim introduces several of them. If you're a big Jim Reeves fan, this is a chance to hear him in a more open context than a studio album. Still, his voice without any bass does seem a bit of a waste."
4,Works fine.,"Bought 2 of these. Installed them with the bracked that lowers them away from the ceiling. Fairly easy to install. Light is not quite as bright as I expected & a little on the ""cold"" side, but quite satisfactory for an 18 ft long hallway (both fixtures). They look great. Not the most durably constructed, but how often do you handle a ceiling light?! We are happy with them & feel we got a bargain when you compare other models of similar style. Delivery was no problem & I would reccommend this light."
1,Not worth it.. not bright.. special light bulb,the light isn't very bright.. the plastic is kinda cheaply made.. it requires a special light bulb.. i don't know why amazon removed my previous review. i returned the product.
3,"Nice looks, but can see the outline of the bulbs","The Lithonia lighting has great looks, are easy to install and fit perfectly. The only complaint if you will as seen in other reviews is that one can see the outline of the bulbs. OK for hallway and good for basement where there are not many people coming in and out."
4,Basic but nice,"This light isn't anything spectacular but they look very nice. I put one in my office, loft, and extra bedroom and they get the job done. Not extremely bright."
4,I'll never invest in a mutual fund again....,"Clear and concise. Managed accounts used to be for the wealthy. Things have changed though...investors can get into a separate account for $25,000 or less. The Jury is in... there is no doubt that many money managers beat the indexs (the good ones). These guys are professional money managers NOT MARKETERS who sell for commissions. Consequently, this allows them to focus on what's important, managing assets. Further, after one calculates the true costs (including transaction costs) mutual funds are slightly more expensive than the average separate account manager. The problem with mutual funds is that they typically are required to invest a minimum of 75% of the investors assets at ALL TIMES! Remember 9-11? Who wants to be in full-on in the market then?! Separate account managers were able to flee the equities markets because they aren't bound by the ""diversification"" restrictions that mutual funds are. Stuff to think about...."
4,Spiritual traveler,"Floating lyrical melodies, violin arabesques, sensuous rythms, leading us throught sinuous corridors into the eastern mediterranean light!"
1,Easy to administer,My vet recommended these for my dog; she has soft stools and is having a problem with her anal glands. I sprinkle a capsule over her food twice a day and have been doing so for close to 3 months and it has not helped at all.
5,THE PERFECT REMEDY FOR A CONSTIPATED CAT!,"I have a 20 lb cat(not fat,just BIG)that has always had issues with being constipated. I have tried many remedies: pumpkin, Lactulose (an Rx laxative from the vet), special food,etc. After hours of researching products on the web, I stumbled across Vetasyl fiber caps. This stuff gets mixed in with the food and now the cat actually likes the taste of his wet food better!! He gets one capsule every day and it has solved the problem completely. My other cat tends to lean a little on the loose end of the spectrum so he also gets it and it has solved his problem as well. I highly recommend this and will continue to use it."
3,Above average science fiction,"This book was more interesting in the last 100 or so pages than elsewhere. I found the parts on Martian life and the physics of the basis of the plot to be borderline fantasy. However, nanotechnology was included and covered rather nicely as a backdrop to the times. For a book that is much 'harder' science fiction, read MARS by Ben Bova, but this novel does not include nanotech, and to me not including nanotechnology in a science fiction novel today is a major mistake! For a near term SF novel that includes nanotech read the excellent THE FIRST IMMORTAL by James Halperin."
3,could have used an editor . . .,"Remember when Asimov, Bester, Clarke, Clement, Heinlein, etc. could pack action, characterization, and thought provoking social, political, and scientific speculation into 200 page classics? Was ""Dune"" the turning point, after which all ""sci-fi"" novels had to be as epic as ""War and Peace""? I don't know, but this last generation of sawdust filled 500, 600, and 700 page doorstops has definitely soured me on science fiction. Nevertheless, I thought I'd try ""Moving Mars"" - after all, it was a Hugo nominee, so it must be great, right? Wrong. When Bear finally gets down to business, he's a pretty good read, but the first 350 pages of ""Moving Mars"" is mostly filler. Unfortunately, the author doesn't seem to have too much empathy with his first person narrator, either, and the science? well, what about tidal forces, for instance? Just call me an old fogey, but I'm going to go back and reread ""Double Star"" now."
3,moving mars - excellent concept,"Ive never come across a premise of ""tweaking"" descriptors to move matter ( and i'll say no more to spoil...). One big disappontment came from how Character Driven the story is (the reason I stopped RED MARS half way through); also, the side tracks Bear takes with virtual reality, somthing that's been done to death. But the prose is great elsewhere. The description at the end of Casseia's memorial stays in mind, & was worth it just for this."
1,Worst Protagonists Ever,"Anything I say about the reasoning for my title would give away too much of the plot if you are unfortunate enough to read this book. The general vision of the future was interesting, the social interactions and the like, but the main character was about a thick as the door of a bank vault. She progresses in society through no talent of her own; people keep picking her as some sort of special case (perhaps they know she is the main character of a book). At no point is she ever able to really step up and do what needs to be done."
2,A Romance Novel..apparently,"Maybe my title isn't fair since I didn't finish the book...but I just couldn't. I tried to stick with it but after 100 pages of sappy, juvenile romance peppered with only the tiniest bit of anything resembling sci-fi, I just couldn't take it anymore. Bear seems like he's probably a good writer if he can lay off the estrogen since the (very) few sci-fi bits in the first 1/3 of the book were decent. I'll probably try something else of his to be sure...but I'll pass on this one. Glad I got it used for dirt cheap."
3,A dissapointing read,"I can't believe this is the same guy who wrote the brilliant ""Queen of Angels"". Most of the novel is about politics, but doesn't adequately explain why we should be rooting for Mars, other than the narrator is Martian. It gets pretty good in the last 150 pages or so, when it becomes a story about science and gains some suspense. It feels like Bear took his wonderful scientific speculations and hid them away in a couple of pages, probably for broader appeal. I guess it made for more sales, but it did not make for a great read"
3,The title says it all...,"Bear has written some really great science fiction, but this book is a bit stale. I just realized it won the Nebula, and aren't I surprised. The thing I like most about the novel was the 'quantum descriptor' stuff. The part I like least was; well, the title really does sum up the story. The reader has so suspense or feeling of surprise. The entire novel comes off as just a vehicle to get to the end and, you guessed it, move Mars."
4,Matian Revolution,"Mars doesn't like to be treated like a colony. Problem is, Earth runs everything. How do you break free of Earth's grip without risking interplanetary war? Moving Mars has a great mix of politics and tech. The book takes place in the same universe as Queen of Angels and Slant. It helps to read the other two first but it's not essential."
2,Sucked.,"Maybe I didn't get it. I thought the book was juvenile, the characters one-dimensional, and the plot didn't grab me. Well below Greg Bear at his best"
2,Not Impressed....,"I gave this book 2 stars because Greag Bear is a fantastic writer. He is excellent with complex story lines and characters. Unfortunately, I did not enjoy this book at all. I found the first 300 pages boring (i can't believe i made it through the book!). I dont understand how such an interesting plot can be written in such a ""blah"" manner. Well, I'm glad I read Blood Music before Moving Mars or I would have never read it. LOVED that book! One more thing, the main reason I dont think I enjoyed this book is I don't feel he writes women (or at least Cassiea) very well."
4,Ambition that delivers. Wow.,"Other viewers have covered all the ground and believe them. My two cents: Over the top hard science fiction that still holds up as semi-plausible 15 years later. And that is no small feat.I ding it one star for not being the best narrative ever. There are plenty of terrific engrossing dramas and character studies out there and this book doesn't come close. But if you crave that hard science fiction ""sense of wonder"" this is truly as good as it gets. Go."
4,Slow Start.....Strong Finish!,"Initially, Moving Mars is a ponderous story of a young woman's sojourn into adulthood and her career. However about mid-point in the story, Bear picks up the plot pace and the science, writing on the level of Robinson technically and higher in story line. Strong characters are weakened by the slow start, but they come on strong and realistically later. The wrap up is a bit convenient, but still believable."
4,A story about the fight for freedom,"An excellent read. It took awhile to get into at first, but is worth persevering with. The plot is basically about a revolution to remain free. The view of the future political process is depressingly familiar."
3,Not his best work,"I read this book and Kim Stanley Robinson's Red Mars back-to-back, and this book really suffered in comparison. I was disappointed, because Greg Bear is one of my favorite authors. For Greg Bear at his best, read ""Forge of God"", ""Eternity"" or ""Eon""."
4,Ann Lee does it again!,"This single is the third single taken from the 'Dreams' album, following '2 Times' and 'Voices'. In fact it's a shame that 'they' have chosen to release a cover version of ""ring my bell' when there are so many great ORIGINAL songs on the album,but it's a good song anyway... It translates the old version bang up to the new millenium with up-to-date dancebeats with that typical eurodance-flavour. All remixes are well done and substantionally different from the album version that it's even worth buying if you have the album already... so go buy it! The German bonus-remixes of '2 Times' and 'Voices' make this great value!"
2,Tries to cover too much material,"I have the 4.5 version of this book and the book has gotten worse. A significant portion of the book is now provided on CD-ROM, which I don't like. In my opinion, it would be better if the publishers would either produce two volumes or narrow the topic down to a length suitable for a single book.The coverage of 4.6 features is very spotty. Some features the book covers fairly well, some features poorly, and some not at all.I hope this book will be completely revamped and refocused for R5.I'd recommend against the book for most people. It doesn't work as a reference. It doesn't cover topics in enough depth to be a suitable introduction. It also doesn't follow application development progression enough to be a tutorial. So I'm not sure who the audience should be.You can't be all things to all people, and unfortunately, this book tries anyway."
3,Tries to cover too much?,"I read most of this in a very boring week. Notes/Domino is now such a big product that trying to cover the usage, development and administration aspects is too big a job for one book - even one as thick as this. I think this is tacitly acknowlegded as extra chapters are on CD. In particular the admin elements are very basic.I was impressed by the LotusScript chapters - I had struggled with OO concepts but this book sorted me out with the basics.There were a few instances were the examples were still 4.5 rather than the 4.6 equivalent. I tried to mail the publisher on the e-mail address supplied (brave I thought) but the mail bounced (not so brave I thought).I hope the next version is available in three volumes or a boxed set."
2,If you really want to read about it so...,"As usual, the Unleashed books about Notes/Domino tends to be very boring to read, it doesn't inspire you to continue looking up things in this book. It does not show all new web design stuff that you actually can do with 4.6. Covers alot, so if you have Great patience then this could be something for you , but spending 10 pages describing a single simple function really is to much."
4,"Good book, wish there was more detail on new 4.6 features","I had the 4.5 version of this book, and am happy I bought the new version, but for mine I wished there was alot more coverage of new 4.6 features for development. But at this stage there ain't alot of choices available for books on 4.6.Otherwise it is very thorough, and covers alot of ground. Having the CD containing the book content in a Notes database is very handy."
4,Great Book on Notes 4.6 - A nice reference book,"After having read many books, this is probably one of my favourites. For novice to intermediate users the coverage is excellent. For advanced users, it's a good refresher on the basics. Good detail related to Notes and the Net."
3,It's ok,It's ok product. It's stable and can hold my Canon 7D with 70-200mm without any issues.The pro et contra of this product is its weight. While providing stable platform for photography - because of the weigh! - carrying this tripod on field trips becomes a challenge. Another downside is construction of the head - with heavy equipment installed it may not firmly hold when turned 90 degrees.Otherwise I would recommend this product if you are using it at home (or studio) or as a beginner's tripod.
5,Slik 615-315,This is a very sturdy and proffessional piece of equipment. Compared to the other pro brands this is the best bang for the buck. The head is very strong as it hold my canon 30d and 24-70 in place with no problems. That includes the verticle position. Those two together are pretty heavy.I am completely satisfied
5,Great Tripod,"The greatest thing I have found, besides the rock steady and easy use of this tripod, is the fact that by getting one now, with carbon fiber being the rage, I have what would have been the top of the line, hundreds of dollars tripod for a fraction of the cost. I'd rather pay $100 for ""heavy"" (not that heavy really) steel, than the same tripod, weighing 1/4 the weight and four times the price. It is one slick ""SLIK""."
5,GREAT TRIPOD!,Outstanding features. Well built. Only concern is the material covering the upper legs. This material is a foam type of texture and I am concerned about its durability during heavy use.
5,Great Deal!,Why can't everything be so well made? Fantastic tripod especially for the price. If you need a strong and sturdy tripod with a nice smooth head- then look no further then the 700DX.
4,Get the legs and purchase another head,"This is a really solid tripod and the foam part adds to its light yet sturdy feel. I can put it in the supplied bag and walk around with it without it feeling too heavy (though I'm a big guy, 6'5 225lbs). The panhead is too slow and gets in the way of quickly changing orientation. You have to loosen one or two of the handles, adjust the camera, and re-tighten them again. They are too large and awkward to be operated smoothly.I suggest you get the legs for around 100 bucks on here and get you a decent head, even though it might be more expensive. If you take landscape shots and don't need to quickly change from one angle or orientation to another, then I think this one is for you."
5,Smooth tripod,This tripod is the first one that I've owned that really feels solid. I'm a tall guy and the tripod range of height is perfect for me. The action is smooth and the feel is professional. It is heavier than other tripods but it hasn't been a problem. My camera is completely secure resting on this platform. The adjustments to angle or panning are easy to operate and very smooth. I'm very happy with this purchase.
5,solid and tall,"When using the Slik Pro 700DX for my cameras I have not used the total height, but I apreciate how solid it holds the cameras. The cameras I'm using are a Panasonic video camera and a Nikon 8700.Where I am really impressed is how well it holds my 25 x 100 binoculars. The weight and change of balance of the binocs when I am moving around and changing position has been more than some other tripods have handled well. The Slik Pro handles them very well and the height is fantastic for allowing me to stand and still look up at the sky."
4,Great Tripod!,"This is a well built, strong tripod. Ive been using this product to hold a Sony digital camera to record my kids athletic events. I grew tired of buying cheap tripods every year due to the fact that they kept breaking. I suspect Ive bought my last tripod for a while. The sucker is strong as an ox and should hold up in a tornado. It is a little heavy to carry, but not bad. The carrying case makes toting it around easy. It sets up in a few seconds and holds my camera still. If I have any complaint, it's that the head jerks a little when I'm trying to make slow rotational turns to follow the actions. Be aware, this tripod does come with a good carrying case. You do not need to order the one they suggest you order with it."
4,"Rock solid, weighs a ton","This is a super tripod that's rock solid, extends to great height, and has built-in levels and a smoothly panning head. Just be aware that it weighs a ton, so if you're looking for a tripod to carry around all day this might not be your best choice."
5,Strong and solid though you pay for it with weight.,"I love this tripod. Very solid and rigid with no issues at all in the 18 months since purchase. Plenty of height (I am 6'3"" and it goes more than high enough). I like the padded legs - especially when carrying in winter. Lots of adjustment and everything is smooth.My only complaint is that I find myself carrying this along less and less - just too heavy to haul along on a backpack that is already loaded with gear. I am now shopping for a CF tripod for field work.Great tripod but not light. For the $$ it is a great value and will hold up some pretty serious weight. But be prepared for the weight."
4,Great step up from cheapo tripod,"Solid build. Once you have the base attached to your camera, very quick to release or fasten it on. Leg adjusters are good, but there are styles out there that are easier to snap open. The neck is easy to lower and raise.Only complaint is having to unscrew the handles to get it in the bag, but I don't think there's any way around that."
4,sturdy and smooth operator,this is very nice product. very steady very reliable. Couple this with the wired/wireless remote and you have got yourself a stand alone system. Operation is smooth and effortless -- you will have to know where the knobs for each hinge is at.Timelapse movies :).the only thing is the lowest is height is not very low and the weight. I have to carry it as a separate baggage when i travel -- not so cool.
4,SLIK PRO 700DX Professional Tripod with Panhead (625=315),"Perfect tripod for many applications, spotting scope, camera etc. Easy to use, has great movement. The only thing that I did not like was the weight, a little heavy. I guess that is something to have to get use to, and if you want a well made and (professional) tripod you have to expect that little inconvience. Overall a great tripod"
4,Nice Tripod Replace the Head,This stable tripod is both durable and has a great build quality for the price. The stock tripod head is small and has a plastic build quality which has been insufficient for some of my early time lapses. I have opted to purchase a more durable tripod head to go along with this tripod. These tripod legs in conjunction with the Manfrotto 501HDV complete the basis for my tripod set up.The tripod head is not very good if you are serious about video. I recommend upgrading to something like a Manfrotto 501HDV. They complement each other very well.
4,Solid sturdy Tripod,Tripod is excellent. Purchased to take using my Digital SLR to the next level and love this tripod. Considered it a bit heavy when first taking it from the box. But packed it around for 2 hours taking night pictures of christmas lights and never noticed its weight. Windy night and worked great! Definitely recommend
4,Pros and Cons of the Slik Pro 700 AMT,It is a very well constructed product. Camera is very secure and easy to maneuver to any angle. The only draw back is that it is heavy. Not something you would want to go treking in the wilderness with for a long period.
1,Cheap,Do not buy this is a poorly made and cheap product. I bought it and never placed it on my vehicle.
3,Nice feel but expect lots of wrinkles after the 1st wash!,"Well-made all cotton sheets. I was dissapointed in the excessive wrinkles that these particular sheets showed after the first washing. If your not a stickler for how wrinkle-free your sheets should look, then these are okay for you. If you want a nice looking as well as comfortable sheet, go with another, this one is high maintenance on the appearance because they will need hand ironing to look nice..."
4,Great product......good condition...too long to get to me,"So the product was in good to great condition. the book is easy to read, have just started. My only complaint it that it took almost 1.5 weeks to get o me. I have never waited this long for a book."
4,A good overall general puppy book,"This is a simple guide to train your puppy. But it doesn't give a deep insight to understand the canine behaviors. So if you really want to understand your puppy, read other books too along with this one."
5,Good book to add to your puppy reading,"I've read a lot of puppy books lately, and although I would not use this book as a complete overview for the new owner, it did cover a lot of information that is not in the standard puppy books, yet still valuable to know. Clearly organized with very useful information."
3,Pretty good,"This book is full of GREAT information and was very helpful since I had never owned a dog before. But I only gave it three stars because it doesn't have anything that you can't already find online for free! It will be a good reference if I am in a training situation and the power goes out, thus limiting my access to the internet!"
4,Great Book for everyone,"I bought this book before I got my puppy. It is full of great advice on all aspects of getting and rasing your puppy into the problem-free dog you want. It has full colour photographs and step by step guides to teaching your dog basic commands and lots more. it is a very good book. the only thing which could be improved is the basic training section, where i think it should be explained further. but overall this book is very useful and I recommend it."
1,Caveat Emptor,"I'm not sure how a cable can rate two-four stars. It either works or it doesn't (one or a five). This cable came shipped in a cardboard box, and was bound within the box in plastic. I can only assume that since the packaging wasn't damaged the cable left the factory and arrived at my door. It doesn't work, the video came through, but the sound was erratic (cut in and out, sometimes the video was pixelated). I trouble shot it with a known HDMI cable, and that worked with my TV (Samsung Aquos 32"" inch), the component outs worked fine as well.I didn't have too high of hopes for this cable, since it was cheap, but it proved as such to my dissatisfaction. They do give a full refund (normally returns incur a 15% restocking fee (SAVE YOUR PACKAGING TO AVOID THIS)) if their technicians ""verify"" the product was faulty.I bought a few mediabridge 6' cables and they were cheap and THEY WORKED!"
5,It is digital,"When it comes to traditional speaker wire or component video wire, there is a big difference with the high-end and low-end, as shielding and quality of material makes a big difference with analog signals; any spurious interference comes across as pops, hiss or picture disturbances etc... With digital, you DO want to eliminate as much interference as possible, but as long as bits can be determined as either being in an on or off state, your signal will go through perfectly. As technology improves, the bit rate increases, making tolerances tighter for a good connection.Look at Ethernet... CAT5 cable works great for speeds up and around 100 Mbps... often it will work fine at 1 Gbps, but at 1 Gbps, it is recommended to use a cable that passes higher quality standards, so CAT6 is recommended. At the moment, as long as an HDMI cable is HDMI 1.3 compliant, it should work fine... probably a 1.2 would be fine too."
2,works but broke after a few weeks,"i have been using this too hook my computer to my tv but that means I am constantly removing and replacing it in my computer and after a few weeks and about 20 or so hook ups, i pulled the cable and it left the metal connector in my hdmi port. so if your just hooking it up and its gunna stay hooked up then this will work fine for you but if your like me your going to need something with the connector more secure on the wire. so don't let my review discourage you from buying it unless you plan on using it like i did.MC"
4,Excellent Prouct,I just received this cable and boy did i want to test it out!!!Granted the cable looks flimsy but it works like a charm. I connected my Dell XPS to my TV and its painfully clear!!!I searched a lot of websites for a HDMI to HDMI cable under $5 and i found it finally here on Amazon. It ships for a total of under $5 and is 15 feet long and is in perfect working condition. It does take 5 days to reach you but fir the price and the quality of the product its worth the wait! Go for it and don't think too much its 5 bucks!PS:The image may seem as if the two ends are of different sizes when in fact they are not. Its the same size on both ends.
5,they work. its all they have to do.,"I ordered 2 of these cables for my home theater PC.These cables only have two expectations to fulfill: be 15 feet long, and reliably move electrons. they do both flawlessly.build quality is cheap, but good. there are no parts of this cable that look like they are an obvious weak link.I don't know what the heck people are doing to their cables, but you generally plug it in, and never think about it again. there's no real way these things could fail unless you keep messing with them."
2,It works....but,"It works with my setup, X220, display port to hdmi adapter, and every random HDTV I could find. It only gets two stars because my 15' cable is 10' long."
2,low quality,"I primarily use the HDMI cable to connect my laptop to my TV. However, after carefully using it for about a week, one end of the cable began to fall apart. The cable is low quality."
3,Didn't work but seller reimbursed the cost,"We got this cable from eforcity and it ended not working for us. The TV wouldn't recognize the cable unless it was already in HDMI mode. The seller did refund the money, so we are happy with the seller but not the product."
5,HDMI cable at an unbelieveable price,This cable works great-and at 1/50th the price the stores wold sell it for. It might not work for 3D Tv but it works great for a laptop to Sony LCD TV
5,HDMI Why Pay MORE,Stores try to get you to pay over a hundred dollars for a 15 feet HDMI cable. A HDMI cable is a HDMI cable. Why pay $100 when you can pay $5?
5,HDMI Cables,"While I haven't tested these cables side-by-side agains the more expensive ones, they seem to do an adequate job, especially for the money. I notice that darker scenes seem less clear and tend to pixelate while ""finding"" the right shade of black, but all-in-all a very worthwhile investment."
1,GOT SCREWED,"IT'S REALLY SIMPLE - THE HDMI CABLE DOES NOT WORK - THE PICTURE CAME ON, BUT NO SOUND - TRIED IT 20 TIMES AND STILL NO LUCK. I GOT SCREWED, PERIOD. EDDIE E."
4,Works,"I am not a expert on HDMI cables, but as far as functioning.... well it works. I got 2 of these and they both worked out of the box. They are very sturdy in fact maybe to much so. They are thicker than I expected, close to the thickness of a coax cable. Not sure if thats really a negative, I don't think so or care as long as they work. So all in all great product."
5,"HDMI, Buy online!","Looking for HDMI cables couldn't be easier stop wasting time in the malls and stores you are going to be paying outlandish prices for the HDMI cables. I looked at all the discount stores and their cables were of poor quality and high prices.Save time and money and look online. I found this HDMI cable from Amazon buy watching the sales on ""DealNews.com"" and then jumped on it when i saw the price best $2 dollars plus S/H. I have ever spent. The quality is comparable to the $50 HDMI cables in the Electronic Stores. and the length is more than enough.The picture quality of my TV is nice and sharp and I can now watch Netflix in 1080p using my PS3."
1,JUNK,I shouldn't have expected more than what I got (JUNK) for the price of this cable. I went with a nice Mediabridge cable instead.
1,Terrible quality!,"I was excited to find this cable at such a cheap price, but am very glad I didn't pay more for it. It works ok once in a while, but usually I just get pixelated circles all over my tv screen when I turn on the Blu-Ray player. I was really hoping this would work so I wouldn't have to spend more money on a cord. I would not waste your money on this product. I will be going to a store to buy another one soon."
1,Not much to it...,"Bottom-line, if I were to shop for this cable in a store where I could have seen it first, I wouldn't have bought it. Poor plating, very thin wire and an overall question of whether this cable could achieve the minimum specs for a HDMI cable. The cable shielding is so thin one would guess that it would become an antenna for RF interference. Pass on this one."
1,Never received it!,"I never received this shipment but paid for it. I checked with the receiving dock and mail room at work as well as the local post office but it is nowhere to be found.Didn't get any help from the merchant, either. I have a couple of other missing shipments and of the three, one merchant was helpful and issued a refund."
2,Seems like a cheap product,It is one of those cheap products made in china. No complaints as I only paid less than 2 Dollars. I wouldn't expect miracles from 2 Dollars. But one shouldn't be deceived the fact that they were getting more than 70 Dollars value for 2 dollars.
1,"no picutre, no sound","I had no picture and no sound when I connected Directv to my television. Paid so little for it, I'm not returning it, but thought I should write a review to let others know it didn't work at all."
1,Poor picture quality.,"Bought this item for the usual purpose, attaching a cable box to my TV. Picture quality was poor. Product had to be returned."
3,You get what you pay for.,"Well this is what I expected it would be. Don't get me wrong, it works but it is a cheaply produced, ""made in china"" cable. It definitly serves its purpose though."
1,Not very good.,"First off the cable is very, very skinny, not a good sign. Bought 2 for my 2 22"" Asus Monitors. One was hooked up HDMI to HDMI, the other was HDMI to Displayport adapter. Got massive pixelation on both monitors. Then hooked up my tv to the same HDMI port with a quality 50ft cable, no issues. This is a no buy, shame for the price."
1,Worst cable I have ever bought.,"Cheap piece of junk, the diameter of the cable is very small and doesn't carry a signal very well. Immediately plugged my laptop into the TV to test and all I was able to get was the dreaded green screen. I reluctantly replaced it with a different HDMI cable off Amazon and was actually really impressed with the quality of what I got. If you are looking for a really good quality cable for cheap, I recommend you get a BlueRigger brand cord."
5,"wow, nice cable","I was skeptical at first when I looked at the price, but when I received the item I could not believe how well made the item was. The cable alone is super heavy duty, like an outdoor extension cord. I'm using the cable to go from my HDMI out on my computer to my TV, works perfectly. Thank you so much for a great deal and saving me from overpriced cables, like those purchased @ B Buy."
3,Missing Theme Song - but otherwise not bad,"If you've watched the previews for this film, you're likely expecting a song called Jesus Walks by Kanye West to be on the soundtrack but it's not there - very annoying. But otherwise it's a pretty good CD of music to listen to while you work out or drive fast."
2,NOt happy,"Didn't really like this book as I thought it would help with digital photos. But this was for photos done way back when they still did airbrushing. Oh, well."
3,Size...,"I bought this item for my twin brothers who are pretty close in size (5'11, 180ish lbs) . However, one fit the other didnt and had to be returned. So this item is not an ""one size fits all"". So those who are a thin build, this item would work great. In respect, it was good quality for the price."
2,About what I expected for the price,"This was very cheaply made and the pull strings are already ripping out after a couple weeks use. It is very difficult to get a sock on the device and, for anything other than ankle socks, the socks stick to the terry cloth and do not pull up. Would not recommend."
4,"Beautiful model, but painting should be better",The model is well designed and I liked the overall shape. Just the painting work should be better. It is really different from the prototype model (which is the one photographed on the box).
5,"Information on Single Wing Offense with the Spinning Fullback, by John Aldrich","I am John Aldrich's daughter, Lea. For those of you who are unaware, my dad passed away last June. Unfortunately, we ran out of copies of his original book. However, due to popular demand, we are in the process of republishing the original, hardback book, as well as, putting the videotape that accompanied it onto CD for coaches to purchase as either a keepsake of our dad's work or to use to coach their youth football teams. If you are interested in being put on a waiting list for his book and CD, please contact me at spinningfullback@mchsi.com. We will let you know, as soon as possible, when his book will be available for purchase. Thank you for your interest in our father's passion, the Single Wing, through all of you his legend lives on.... Best Wishes, Lea Aldrich"
3,Good In Small Doses,"This compilation of Bill Wyman's favorite blues songs gives a decent history of blues music. While listening to this music, it is quite interesting to note the influence it had on many rock n roll bands.However, the versions presented here are a stark in arrangement. Although they are performed well, usually its just a guitar and a vocal or a piano and a vocal. A few instrumentals thrown in for good measure. Unfortuantely after a while it all sounds pretty similar in spite of some good performances.Truthfully, I would prefer a smaller compilation of blues standards as opposed to this extensive batch. Nonetheless, big time fans of blues music might want to at least preview this collection."
5,Helping Me on My Diet,"delicious and not too high on sodium....These help me eat more salads, which are necessary on my summer diet! Fresh, crispy, tasty, just the right salty crunch to add a savory touch to my salads. I love them!"
2,"4 pages ""expanded"" to 150 pages","The book was a big disappointment! There is enough ""good"" information for perhaps a short magazine article. One gets the impression the author was trying to fill up the pages much the way we did when we had to write a 150-word essay in school.I also question the validity of many of the so-called secrets he reveals. I've worked in the area of National Defense for many years. Much of what he claims as fact I seriously doubt is true. All-in-all the material should have been covered in about a 1000 word article.A disappointment! A least it is a fast read - since there are only 172 pages of text."
1,Money is the root !,"I read this book with a open mind and my heart is telling me the Spy here should not have the right to defect to our country . Lunev in my mind is still a Spy and always will be a Spy ! The only thing the reader learns is , that Lunev is a Spy ! I was counting on learning more about weapons etc in Russia . I think Lunev is lying to keep his stay in the US . We have enough problems of our own . The FBI , CIA ,NSA , and many more should be ashamed of the way they do bussiness with Russia . All they do is bring in more problems for us . You can read this book if you have a couple of hours to waste on reading about how a Russian Spy is now Spying on the US with the help of our government . Lunev should have a good life now and I wish him the best . I only hope and pray that Lunev keeps his wish for the U.S to have it's freedom ."
1,NEETS are free on Navy websites!!!,"You can download the NEETS books for free over a large number of Navy Sites. Once more if your in the Navy, check with your ESO who should already have a copy of the NEETS for you."
3,Update to my review,"This is a great scanner. Unfortunately my computer crashed over the summer and I was upable to find the installation disk. When I called the company to see about getting another disk, they suggested that I buy the Microtek 3740 instead. They were absolutely no help."
3,Not the originals!,"While the songs on this collection are well done, and Freddy is in reasonably good voice, make no mistake -- these are live ""remakes"" (from God-knows-when -- the set has essentially no annotation) and not the originals. For the real hits from the mid-seventies, you'll need to go elsewhere."
1,Out of Synch.,"This product takes over the whole of the PC desktop and blocks access to any other program while it is running (which might be reasonable if the PC processor will only cope with one program at a time which is not the case with most up-to-date PC's) The authoring and burning program results in audio out of snych in every case with clips of any reasonable length, other than a few seconds. (A half-hour clip of captured video will, when authored or burnt result is audio so 'out' that it is unwatchable). This does not seem to be correctable. I would not recommend this product."
3,Good For Basic Home Movies,"This is a pretty good product for BASIC home video. However, in most cases Windows Movie Maker 2.1 is the way to go. Ulead VideoStudio 8 lacks in creative titles, credits, and can only be used for reasonably short movies without rapidly slowing down the process. The only way it can be used over Windows Movie Maker is that VideoStudio 8 can be used with Windows Media Player, QuickTime, and Real Player while Windows Movie Maker only accepts Windows Media."
4,Good product for beginners,"This is a good product for beginners because of one very important reason... it comes with a disc that shows you how to do each step. I've used this to create a DVD for my nephew's 5th birthday. My in-laws had tons of video on VHS that I went through, transferred much of it to my digital camcorder, then to my computer via this product. Worked like a charm. Added tons of effects, graphics, and music. Turned out great. I really like this product. Only knock I have against it... I'd like the ability to add words in the stock footage provided, replacing the words within that footage. For example, there footage of the world, with ""ulead"" going around it. I'd like to put my own words. Other than that, I think this program is easy to use, fun to use, and worth every penny."
5,You can't beat it for the price,"Does exactly what it's supposed to. Some complain of a steep learning curve - I watched their online tutorials before starting, and it was pretty easy. Captures sharp-looking video from my Sony MiniDV camcorder via IEEE1394. I can edit all my clips together, insert titles, voice-over track, scene transition effects and burn a DVD with menu, all just with mouse clicks. Hasn't crashed yet. My only complaint is that the controls for tweaking the audio levels on the main video track are very fiddly, and the user guide is a bit sparse on exactly how this aspect is supposed to work."
3,The Flight suit is okay,"The material is light and airy, good for summer in southern afghanistan (think west texas or phoenix). The waist tabs don't work very well, but the the rest of the suit is fine for my purposes and the price was right."
1,burn ward candidate,"Polyester might be OK for Halloween, but not for aviation. You are only issued one set of skin. Spend the extra money and buy something fire resistant."
1,i feel like CRYING!,"i bought this after christmas.it just plain FREAKED ME OUT!when you don't play with her for a few days(even if she's in sleep mode)she comes down the stairs looking mad,makes a mean face,then walks out the door carrying a suitcase.and when she's gone,a ghost floats around in the house!she freaks me out.she's left the house TWICE!i took the batteries out and put her away so i wouldn't have to look at her.she was supposed to be so fun!i spent almost $30 on her!30 bucks down the drain!do not buy this if you don't want to frighten your daughter or make her want to give this to her friend!PS.they made a toy where if you don't play with it for a few days,the fun part goes away!i hope they stop selling these by my birthday"
1,Not Nearly Worth the Price,Got this early for Christmas and held it for our daughter.It either eats batteries like nothing I've ever seen or it'sjust broken. Very difficult for our daughter to use and onlyseems to work intermittently. When it does work our daughterjust doesn't seem to enjoy playing with it much. Quite adud given the fact that it's pretty expensive.
5,My dream toy!,I love pixel chix! She teaches you to take care of others. The changes I would make are:1 more levels 2 in color and 3 you can program in a name. if you can get 2 it's worth it so you can connect all the time!
1,Pixel ChEAP Doll House,"I purchased the toy for one of my nieces...the toy NEVER worked and once I was able to, wasn't possible to connect with other units...worst gift ever"
5,Grandgirls Love the Pixel Chix Dollhouse,This item is an add-on to other Pixel Chix products that can be interconnected. Grandgirls love this. Item arrived promptly and in excellent condition.
5,Awsome Toy,Pixel Chix is so much fun! I love it.Kinda pricey but alot of fun evry girl should have one! It's Awsome!!! :) Best toy EVER!!!!!
1,Pixel chixs sux!,"At first i bought this pixel chix for a plane flight but now i hate it & want to get my money back. At first it is fun for a while, but i finished all the levels and went back to the beginning and since i was so busy on my holiday, then when i turned it on by accident it said ""HEY!where have you been I thought you were my friend!"" and I saw cobwebs and then when I played with her she said ""NO WAY"". I stopped playing with her for a day and then she came down the stairs with a suit case and stuck her tounge out and then a ghost came out to haunt the house then it gives you a second chance but when you push any button she walks out again so it is a good dust catcher and we got it in england and it is double the price 60$!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!waste of time and money"
4,Tight,"joe mon has really come into his own with his vocal style and lyrical ability. A mellow yet gritty sound, I THORoughly enjoy the album. I am looking forward to seeing the band live in INDY this weekend."
2,pretty boring i must say,"i heard ""gravitate"" on music choice one day, and figured the cd was worth a shot used on amazon.ehh not really.""gravitate"" is a very good catchy rock track sounding like fuel,tonic,and prime sth.other than that it just falls flat.pretty bland and uninspiring.i guess they just got lost in the heaps of other mellow modern rock bands that just couldnt make it."
1,Transmatic,"I am in shock of how boring this music is. I can't believe major labels are still signing bands that sound this lame!?! When will good original, dare I say 'groundbreaking', bands start getting signed to majors? Or are the majors to scared to take a risk? This band is not a risk. This band is part of a gigantic group of stagnant music that makes bright new bands cringe. The dinosaurs of rock music."
1,"Arrived damaged, and doesn't work for small bikes","I just put this rack together today, and one of the major pieces (the ""arm"" of the rack, which is the piece which actually holds the bike) was broken. This meant that half the bike rack is unusable.This was not the deal-breaker for me, though. This rack doesn't work for small bikes!!!! I have a 44 cm frame, women's specific racing bike, and the ""arm"" was too large to fit my bike frame, so there is literally no way to hang my bike on this rack. Small cyclists, beware!"
1,not happy...,Very flimsy construction.Poor quality for the actual bike holder itself. The pads have already fallen off after two days of use !!!!
2,wood grain dash,"this produce looks very good,except when installing it tears in the thin spots,and tha instrument around the gauges does not fit,i do not have the company information,i woulg get replacemeny parts as they garanteed all of them,i have 4 pieces that need to be replaced,raymond scott 360 281 1728"
5,Lots of trips to keep one busy kayaking South Florida,"Nigel Foster has finally turned his excellent writing skills to South Florida. Having kayaked in South Florida for the past 6 years, I have personally done most of the trips described in the book. Mr. Foster's descriptions are brief, but his attention to detail, and excellent on-water guides make the book very useful. Short accounts of the history of some areas (i.e., ""The Watson Mystery"") enliven the book. It is written in the style of a travel guide - a bit unusual for a guide to kayak touring, but it lends itself to the area. His ""Caution"" tips, e.g., ""Watch out for racoons at your picnic site."" are well-chosen. Trip ratings are very reasoned and appropriate, e.g., ""Paddling the outer coast is committing, with exposure to the Gulf...Waves across Whitewater Bay generally produce a short chop...No one lives in this area, and there's no way out of it except at the camping sites...."" A concisely written book. Well done!"
5,Great for planning your eco-trip,"Thank you Nigel Foster for such a complete and wonderful guide! I have been to a few areas in Florida, and can not wait to go this February and ""try"" out a few more of the recommended trips. A friend and I are going to go to Ding Darling Refuge and the Black Island (Lover's Key) trip at the very least. The trip descriptions have me longing for my vacation to get here. Very good maps, and I appreciate the section on places to stay and camp!"
4,Very good book if you don't know the area,"This is a really good book for kayakers, if you are not familiar with the area or the weather habits. Each location in Florida is a little different. From tides to weather. What I like about it is it gives you alot of info BEFORE you get out there. This helps make the kayaking adventure more fun, as you are more prepared and aware. If you are not familiar with the area, get this book! I live here in FL, and travel all around. Fortunately, I am already aware of the majority of the info in this book. I was merely looking for more areas to use the kayaks. If you are a beginner, or from out of state...get this book before you head out and become a statistic! ha ha. But really, some good preperation and info will help with a great day of kayaking in the many great areas of Florida!"
3,This should be titled The Yardbirds live w/Eric Clapton,"This Cd is a fairly decent rendition of some classic songs, but there is not a single Eric Clapton vocal and it's clearily a Yardbirds era collection (which isn't half bad) The songs aren't as juiced or as primal as say George Thorogood or some other roots based groups but I won't dish them either. They're just early songs that Clapton played on. Since I enjoy the yardbirds and Clapton's playing, I kind of enjoyed the album but once again it IS NOT Eric Calpton and friend it's if anything Friends and Eric Calpton or as I said the Yardbirds w/ Eric Clapton play live."
4,Works great,::EDIT::Disregard any complaints of range in my review. I guess I was just getting interference from something else because it seems to be working very well now! 4 stars!I bought this to use my Apple Magic Mouse on my new Hackintosh. It works well but the reach on it is verrrrrry disappointing. I don't know if i just have a bad model but I can't go more than 3-4 feet without my mouse lagging terribly. I also used it to connect my ps3 controller to my hackintosh but switched to USB because I get more reach with that than with this USB bluetooth adapter.
2,Be careful about PROFILES before you purchase,"Looked like it should do what I needed. After an hour of trying to discover and connect I came across the TARGUS website with some technical details about what PROFILES are not supported by this little device.[...]Might be helpful for those who are considering to check their current device PROFILES and make sure they are on the list. Mine, for a PLATRONICS VOYAGER PRO.. is not on the list. Therefore, there is no way this can work.. and now I must go through the return process.Hope to help the next guy (gal) out there."
3,targus usb bluetooth,The range is very short. I hade to use a extension. but it works. It works well with the extension.
1,recieved the merchandise and it doesnt work,"I recieved it opened the packed, connected to my computer and...nothing. did not work tried it on another computer and still nothing. Read the return policy from the company and they say you have to return items in original ""unopened""package...really? how are you supposed to do that? And you have to pay for shipping...thats just wrong. I have bought alot of merchandise from amazon and their affilliates..and never had an issue if the item was damaged and needed to be returned....cross this company (BuyAccessories) off the list! I will never buy from them again"
1,Doesn't work with Creative D100 and windows 7,"I purchased this adapter to play music wirelessly through my Creative D100 bluetooth speaker. The speaker works with my iphone, and sounds very well. Since I have more music on my laptop, I was excited at the thought of connecting this to my computer. But, it doesn't work. It will identify the speaker, but will not connect."
2,broke on 3rd day (with some help by me ),"Bought this from Office Depot. It worked fine with my wireless Bluetooth mouse. While I was charging my laptop, I forgot the adapter was in and set the computer down on its side. Not a good move. When I came back to my computer, I saw a very bent adapter. Couldn't get it to work afterwards. I'm now gonna buy a microadapter that doesn't stick out so far."
3,Windows 7 64 bit users,"If you're using 64 Bit Windows 7 software, the drivers included on the CD may not work with your computer. What I did to make it work: Uninstall the Broadcom drivers that come with the adapter, go to your computer manufacturer's website, find the bluetooth driver that's compatible with your machine, install it. This fixed the issues. Pain in the A-- though.Hope this helps someone. This probably applies to other bluetooth adapters as well."
5,plug n played.,"in the most bizarre hackintosh build ever, i plugged this thing in and 10 feet away saw my keyboard and even have a cool blue LED on it which they don't even show."
1,Will NOT WORK more than 10 ft. away.,i've used it in my bedroom and walked to the bathroom just outside my room and it loses signal. it just can't go further than 10 ft. funny thing is my friend has the same one but paid $20 for it at best buy. guess i should've done the same cuz her's works more than 30 ft away. weird huh? i think this one is a fake. wtvr. paid for it already and will never buy again.
3,"Great toy, if they would last","My son loves this toy so much we bought a second one after the first one broke....and the second one is now on its way out. Its a fun toy, they just need to make it better."
5,Life Changing,"This book is amazing!I have no idea why this is out of print, but in my opinion Susan Page is a genius!At first I felt like all she was saying was to give in and suppress your own needs.But after reading all the details and reading the examples it started to make more sense and became so much more fulfilling.I highly recommend this to anyone who is having trouble in their relationship or for anyone who simply wants to improve their quality of life."
3,O Brother,"""Raise Up"" was a major hit and played over the radio. In that song, he displayed great lyrical talent, good flow, and nice delivery plus the production was at the point. You would think his album would be like that, but O BROTHER. Only a couple of the other songs are listenable and showed the same as ""Raise UP"". His voice really brings energy, some may compare him to Mystikal, but they are different. However, his rhymes are foolish stuff, they make no sense, even in ""Raise Up"", the production sounds minor league except for ""raise uP"". You have to skip alot, and his rhymes can put you to sleep. I am not saying he is wack, he does have talent, it is just that this is his debut and listening to him, you can tell theres improvements to be made. I would check out his sequel despite the facts of this album.Production: C+Lyrics: B-Delivery: B+Overall: B-"
4,North Carolina's first Star...,Petey Pablo did one good thing with this album and that's..he put North Carolina on the map...this is my home state so I can appreciate that...This cat can flow and the beats are hot but.........for whatever reason...this mc makes North Carolina look a little too much like the dirty south...did you see the video? i though he was in Georgia or Alabama...Stonewash jeans......not in my hood..lol
2,Far From His Full Potential,"Petey Pablo is a rapper from North Carolina who can rap, sing and has great potential. He's came up with songs ""Raise Up"", ""I"", and ""Petey Pablo""(which are all produced by Timberland I might add)and are by far the best tracks on the record. The rest of the songs have nothing special and offer nothing new. Wait and see if Petey can break through in the next few years. He has the potential to."
4,We're ready for it.,"Petey's lyrics are really tight. My fav is Y'all Aint Ready. The South is comin' up big time! Timbaland, as usual, hooked the tracks that just get you bouncin'. I don't dig the slower songs toward the end, but they are saying something. Pick up this cd, you won't regret it."
1,Worst Dirty South Album!,"This CD was the most messed up CD, I ever listened to especially because there was no hot songs on there except for ""Raise Up"", ""Raise Up (All Cities)"", and ""Told Y'all"". That's about it nothing else is hard. Do not buy this CD."
3,Very Diverse!!,"This album is different from the usual rap albums of today. It has a various feel to it which gives it a edge. Its more like 3 and a half stars to me. I expected it to be more krunk but its still a good album. The songs I really dig is: PETEY PABLO, RAISE UP, Y'ALL AIN'T READY, FOOL FOR LOVE, DIARY OF A SINNER, and 919. There are other songs thats close to those like one track called FUNROOM(which is the sickest track I have ever heard but yet straight ridin in a weird way)!! Basically, the more u listen to this album the more u will like it ya heard!!!"
3,"Good, but not ""The Good Times""","Petey's flow is on fire like a match, true, but it doesn't seem to match up to Afroman's ""The Good Times"" which could be the best album of all time. Actually let's forget I said could, and lets just stick with the word IS! But ""Diary of a sinner"" definetly is a good album, just way too much swearing, it hurts my ears a little bit.One love!-Steve"
3,Petey shouldnt team up with Timbaland next time,"This CD is sweet. Bottom Line. Some songs do (...) but Raise Up makes this CD the bomb.I listen to that song about 5 times in a row every time the CD's playing. That song alone makes the CD 5 stars. But, with (...) songs like pretty much the rest of the CD makes it boring sometimes. Raise Up All Cities Remix is pretty much the same as Raise UP. 919, I, and maybe the Fun Room make it a little better. Just a little. but who needs other good songs on the CD when Raise Up can be heard over and over again without the song getting boring? Oh yeah Jive ain't a big rap company but Petey is a good rapper so who cares about companies and ditch Timbaland on your next one Petey, PLEASE!!!!! He makes the album worse with Timbaland on the album he doesnt give Petey time to shine cus he is on just about every song and I dont really like Timbaland that much so I hate those songs hes on. DITCH HIM PETEY!!!!!"
3,Pablo,"Mine friend. He tries to sound like DMX. other than that, I think the songs are pretty good. Raise it Up is a good song. beats are hot. Worth downloading on the net. If you have the money then I would suggest picking it up, but not before you pick up The Great Depression."
1,Horrible!!!!!!! Just Plain Horrible!!!!!!,"This debut from Petey Pablo was just plain disgusting. The only good songs on this album were I, Raise Up, and Petey Pablo. Every other song on here sucked. I got this album for Christmas a couple of years ago and was very disappointed. Fun Room has got to be the worst song on the album. It has a stupid beat and some very elementary lyrics. I didnt like this album from the first time I heard it and then I saw people on here talking about how great it was and XXL Magazine rated it XL a couple of years ago so I thought ""Maybe I should listen to it again with an open mind"" but sorry I still hated it!!!!!!! Petey I know you can do better than this. Please, Im begging you, Please give us something better on your next release becuase you are way too talented to be feeding us this garbage."
2,I realy do not like him.,I really do not care for this guy he is alright but he realy is no Busta Rhymes or DMX. (He's bad) and he needs to go back to the country with the rest of the country folk and eat some hog maws and chitlins.
3,french cafe,"not a bad cd, much closer to being more authentic than others. It does have more of the accordions one hears on the side walks"
5,Simply The Best,"Beautiful album with gorgeous renditions of ""Comes Love"", ""Deep Purple"", and ""Two Sleepy People"". Perfect album to go with ""Sweeter as the Years Go By"". You will not be dissapointed."
1,mayhew,"It is not a toy as I thought but a very fragile collectable. It reads for children over 3. No child can play with this, or adult for that matter."
3,Schindler Schminndler,Eh. Smith knows how to talk. But the subject at hand isn't the greatest for an entire book.
3,comfy but flat,"Just received our chair in the mail yesterday. It took a while for it to expand. Did have a funky smell, but already fading. Girls LOVE it. My husband came home from work and fell asleep in it.The only complaint I have is that its SO NOT as stuffed as it appears to be in the picture. When We sit on it our feet are on the ground , but it is WIDE. This morning I cured up in it with my 4 yr old and watched TV. Hope this helps with your decision to buy or not to buy."
3,It has fuf'd anemically :(,"Well, it's been over a week, and I've repeatedly shaken, stomped on, thrown, and cursed at this thing. It's still pretty un-fuf'd. Meh.I guess you do get what you pay for."
4,It's really big!,"As others have said, you really have to fluff it and roll it around for it to fill out it's full shape. And it is super comfortable! My only mistake is that it is too big for the room I want to put it in. The large fuf is LARGE - like a big mushroom. It's hard to judge size from the product pictures. I just assumed that the women in the photos were probably very petit. Wrong. Fortunately, we can move it to the den, where it will be much loved and I will order a small sized one for the sunroom."
4,Size is Everything !,"I must say, I ""Totally"" underestimated the size of this thing. Dont' get me wrong its great. Comfy as all get out. Better suited for a rumpus or basement family room. As others had mentioned, there is a bit of a platic/chemical like odor that'll goes away with time. A little Frebreeze helps. Other than that ENJOY!"
5,"If there is only one pasta video you ever buy, this is it...",This video taught me all of the fundementals of pasta making and a whole lot more. Mrs. Loretta Paganini the instuctor of this video is also a culinary instructor and her dinamic teaching skills are not only captivating they are hipnotizing as well.
2,American Cast Deserves a CD,"I have to say--Donna in this CD is horrible. She sounds like a little girl and that is so not her charactor in this musical. Sure Louise Pitre did a good job of Donna, but she sounds like an old record playering singing those songs. The ones who deserve a CD is the American Tour with Dee Hoty, she was incredible as Donna and actually sounds like the Donna that she plays so PLEASE come out with a CD of the American Tour!!!!!This CD should not be sold in the US, they say ""hand-bag"" instead of purse for christ sake."
2,Disappointed,This vendor listed the condition of this used CD as very good. It came in a broken case and 4 tracks are so damaged that they ere unplayable and had to be skipped. I'll not order from them again
5,Perfect!!!,"I love this musical.This CD has a raletively high quality, especially on this price.However, cannot copy the music in it nor this CD itself."
1,Mamma Mia,"I didn't care for this CD, so I returned it. However, the transaction in doing so was wonderful. I appreciate the expert service!"
2,Why do the do this?,Muscals aren't just random pop song tied together by an awkward plot line.A decent musical demands in fact a little more. It is a shame that good (if cheesy) ABBA songs and the genre of musical theatre bring each other down this way.The songs are great - they just don't make a musical.Please put an end to the embarassing trend of juke box musicals!
1,What Is Happening to Broadway?,"This is probably the worst musical ever! And yet people still love it!? What is going on? The CD was even worse than the live production (hard to believe.) If I could give it zero stars I would. This goes right up there with Footloose in my bad musical category. To think that it was even nominated for a TONY is beyond me. Someone needs to tell the writers of shows like this that you can't just throw random songs into a script. ""Dancing Queen"" was so random that I wanted to get up and laugh at the people on stage."
2,london cast not broadway,"I just purchased the so-called Broadway version of Mamma Mia. I recently saw the Broadway play and it was spectacular; one of the high spots was the lead voice and supporting voices, as well. This album is NOT of the Broadway version but of the London cast. The lead sounds like a chipmunk and is an insult to the Broadway version. I believe this was sold without telling the consumer that it was not the Broadway version. Since ABBA was in itself a musical phenomenon, the London version should not have even been recorded. And, in addition, there were no encores and it was NOT recorded live. I am a huge Amazon customer and this was the worst mis-advertised purchase I have made. If you want the Broadway version, buy it onsite."
2,"Sorry Brits, But Your Voices Are the Pits","I recently saw the Broadway performance of ""Mamma Mia,"" and it was an incredible show. The songs are all recognizable ABBA, and the great encore tunes of ""Dancing Queen,"" ""Mamma Mia,"" and ""Waterloo"" have everyone dancing, clapping and swaying in the aisles. Sadly, this CD is a recording of the London cast, and the voices are weak. The compilation lacks the incredible energy of the Broadway performance, and the CD's biggest void is the incredible voice of lead Broadway performer Louise Pitre (as Donna). The CD also does not offer the three encore tunes. If you have attended the Broadway performace, you'll probably be disappointed in this CD. I hope a record label soon will record the incredible, current Broadway cast. In the interim, this CD makes a great coaster!"
3,Great Show! Ok CD,"I recently saw a production of the show at the Mandalay Bay in Veagas. The show was one of the sweetest things I have ever seen and, at the end, most of the crowd was dancing in the aisles. While the Veagas show had better vocies, this cd is still a great way to remember the fun that I had. I agree with the the other reviewers who said that you do not need the special edition cd as you are paying extra money for only one extra song."
1,Love The Music But Hate This Version,"I should have paid closer attention to the writeup. All I saw was ""Broadway"", not the London cast. I would have been better off buying the original songs sung by ABBA."
1,Mama Mia dvd,"Rented the movie ""Mama Mia"" before purchasing. I am glad I did. Very disappointed as ABBA is one of my favorite groups and was looking forward to adding this to my collection. I could only take the first 10-15 minutes. Gratuitous foul language and over the top performance by the actors soured this for me. I would expect the exaggerated gestures, facial expressions, and volume at a live performance where the audience is far from the actors. But in a movie where everyone is 5-10 feet fron the tv set it seemed odd and out of place. Maybe if I would have watched a little longer things would have improved, however, by then I was totally turned off."
1,Not good at all,This is not what we wanted. The British accents throw it was off. We just saw it in NY and this is not what we were looking for.
1,Don't be an idiot- do not buy this.,This cd is stupid. Going to see Mama Mia is one thing. It's fun. But why the hell would you want to listen to the cast singing ABBA songs instead of just getting The Definitive Collection or ABBA GOLD? Don't waste your money on this karaoke crap. Get the real deal.
2,"ABBA, YOU ROCK, MAMA MIA, YOU DON'T","I DO NOT SAY THIS IS A BAD MUSICAL, IT'S JUST THIS CD MAKES IT SEEM LIKE IT. I AM TOTALLY LOST. IS THIS THE ORIGINAL BROADWAY SOUNDTRACK OR THE ORIGINAL LONDON CD? (...)"
5,Great!!,"This CD is great! It has all the songs from the play, and you'd probably have to see the play before you rate the CD. I just saw the play in London, and it is definitely worth seeing. The ABBA versions may be better (because they are the originals), but the Mamma Mia! CD is a must-have!"
4,JUST GREAT MUSIC,"I RECENTLY SAW THE SHOW MAMMA MIA IN LAS VEGAS. ALWAYS LIKES THE MUSIC OF ABBA, AND THOUGH THE PLOT WAS THIN, THE MUSIC WAS WELL PERFORMED. IN THIS PARTICULAR ALBUM, THE ENGLISH ACCENTS WERE A BIT MUCH, BUT THE SONGS WERE GREAT. ALL I CAN SAY IS THANK YOU FOR THE MUSIC, ABBA."
4,A belated appreciation of Abba,"I went to see ""Mamma Mia"" under pressure from my relatives. I have never been an Abba fan. Euro-wimps. Music with the character and texture of a Swedish meatball. Forced to sit and listen for two hours, to my surprise I rather liked the music. There's a beat and some decent lyrics hidden under all all the oozy, cream sauce instrumentation spooned over Abba songs. So, I bought ""Mamma Mia"" and I enjoy listening to it -- although I can't hear ""Chiquitita"" without thinking of a Latin woman in a peasant blouse with a banana on her head. And why was ""Waterloo"" omitted from the CD? They sang it as an encore when I attended the play."
4,Good music!,"Music is great. The casting is good, although not as good as the cast in the Las Vegas production!"
3,"In a word, insipid...","A bought this recording as I exited the theatre in Chicago... Now THAT performance of ""Mama Mia"" was spectacular! Either the Broadway performance was poor by comparison (which I strongly doubt) or this cast recording was done in a studio on a Monday morning. While technically excellent, the singing is passionless and totally lacking in the kind of energy and fun that ABBA brought to popular music 27 years ago. Every song on the CD sounds pretty much the same. I suggest that instead, you go see the show in your local theatre, which you'll remember forever!"
1,Wait for the Broadway cd or stick with ABBA's greatest hits,I saw the Broadway performance & loved it & couldn't wait to get the cd. But once I listened to it I was very disappointed. I agree with the other reviewers that the singing lacked the spunk & enthusiasm that the live version brings. I kept thinking that the next song will be better but I was disapointed right to the end. Why ruin a great show with such a bad cd? I'm sticking with the Greatest Hits until the cd of the Broadway cast is released.
5,Thank You For the Music,"Even if you did not see the Broadway Production, the soundtrack to Mama Mia! by The Universal Music Company will keep you rocking through the night with some of ABBA's greatest hits of the 70's. Some of the songs featured on this soundtrack are Mama Mia, Dancing Queen, Super Trouper, Chiquitita, and 20 other great hits. No matter what year you were born, these upbeat songs will for sure keep you happy and will help you to be cheerful on a busy day."
3,Ehhhhh.,"Saw it in London, it was a cute idea, BUT... It's not Broadway. It's pop music put into a cute, fluffy plot.If you like Abba, buy their cds, not this. The voices aren't spectacular. I liked the London cast better."
2,Don't miss this great musical,"It's seldom that a good musical comes out that the entire audience is really into it all. The music is something that everyone will love. I'm glad that I was in the front row in the lodge area because everyone on the lower floor was standing up to most all the music.This week of August 2002, I saw the musical in San Francisco. Its been such a great success that it has been extended through September 2002. DON'T MISS THIS MUSICAL. You'll love it. It truly was a great evening of entertainment and fun. The play is not 'Gone with the Wind' yet everyone was good and some great voices by nearly all the cast. I can't vouch for the CD but I surely hope they make one from this cast. Both characters of Donna (mother) and Sophie (daughter) have great voices and did a great job of singing. I guarantee you that you will enjoy this performance."
2,You can do better than that.,"I actually bought this CD becuase I am a HUGE fan of Benny Andersson and Bjorn Ulvaues' musical CHESS. I have to say that I was kind of dissapointed. I know that these are ABBA's old pop songs, but I figured that the great musical talent displayed in Chess would be put forth here too, but all the songs sound sappy, poppy, and they all sound the same! I guess it serves its purpose, ""The Musical Based On The Songs of ABBA"" but its still dissapointed me. If you like this or not, find a copy of Chess, and I promise you will find something worth listening to."
3,Does it work?,"Listening to this CD I kept wondering if the songs actually worked on stage. They sounded as though they were recorded as songs for an album, not songs that came from a musical. Since I have not yet seen the musical, I will have to see. The album itself tells a little bit about the story. On the whole it was not very entertaining nor the music riveting."
5,Crank up the Volume!,"Loved the show - love the CD. This London cast recording perfectly captures the fun of the stage production. And for all those who were not ABBA fans before seeing the show, know that every word is crystal clear and that you'll be playing this one long and loud. Have fun!"
3,Wonderful play!,"I recently saw the play, and it was absolutely outstanding. Unfortunately, this CD is of the London cast, which is not nearly as good. The New York singers are much better, especially Loise Pitre, who plays Donna. I'm hoping that the recording companies will come to their senses and make a CD of the current cast."
4,"The Original ""Catalog"" Musical","Sure the musical merely ties a couple dozen ABBA songs together to form a loose story ...Sure the concept is a bit cheesey ...Sure the songs are best performed by ABBA themselves ...But it works! ... and it's fun!Broadway's first ""catalog"" musical (though the cd is actually the London cast despite the misleading cover) is fast, fun & worthy of repeat listenings.Best tracks:Mamma MiaDancing QueenGimme! Gimme! Gimme!Voulez-VousThe Winner Takes It AllRelive the 70s & 80s!"
2,"Ok CD, Incredible Live Show! No Comparison!","I saw the show in Los Angeles, and it was incredibly entertaining. Weaving this simple plot line with SO MANY songs was an amazing feat that didn't feel forced. I can honestly say the CD doesn't do the live show justice. If I had heard the CD first, I probably would not have gone to see the show. The cast in L.A. was phenomenal. And from what I here from friends in N.Y., the N.Y. cast was also better than the London cast. I would recommend the show before the CD. However, if you want to buy the CD, I would say going to the show afterward would be very exhilarating. You'll spend the whole show in anticipation waiting to find out when, where and how the next song fits into the story. Quite amazing. I can't think of too many artists that have enough material, let along make sense to have it all together. Go See The Show!"
4,A Good Starting Point,"A good book for beginners and those who are just beginning research on the various mythical beasts. She covers nearly every creature within mythology, quite a few of which I never heard of. At times it felt as though she wasn't saying enough about a creature but she did give enough to go on to further research each one."
4,Great book,This book details more about spirts and even totems that are not the standred totems and this book talks about some of things on astral. Over all a nice book good infomation on finding and understand these other worldy creature this book is just a guide and i would do read on myth on creature and go with your gut feeling. I found the book fun to read i would recommed this one for semi advanced because most that are new are just beginning.This book was one better ones and one of few the touches this subject.Blessed Be;
1,Amazon Hype Sells Books,"Amazon must have a huge profit sharing deal with the author because there is no way anyone with any literary sense whatsoever at Amazon could have read this and enjoyed it. As an avid reader and amazon customer(though I will be more careful in the future) I found this book to be silly and poorly executed. I will agree that the premise is unique, but it ends there. Dig deeper in to all that amazon has to offer and don't fall for this one."
2,Blah,"I find it bizarre that so many people loved this book. It begins fairly strongly, the early character development is complete, but by the middle of the book Mr. Donohue had lost my interest. The characters were no longer emotionally engaging - perhaps he couldn't see the adults as well as the children, the plot meandered off to nowhere, and the ending was a meaningless blank - it was like he just got tired of writing and decided to quit. Thankfully that meant I could quit reading."
5,One Man's ceiling is another Man's floor.,I started reading this book with an uncertainty caused by some of the negative reviews I read here at Amazon. I was pleasantly surprised by how good this book is and was. It is fantasy for those who say it's not. But it's not the fantasy of Tolkien or Lewis. It is more of an adult fantasy in that it includes adult emotions and characters. It's the fantasy of Keith Donohue's mind. This book is not for everyone as no book is for everyone. The tale is exceptionally written for a first novel. I can't wait for his next. I always been told that one man's ceiling is another man's floor. Take all reviews with a grain of salt.
4,"Perhaps the ""Peter Pan"" of our era.","In our world growing up and the difference between childhood and adulthood is very different from Barrie's day. Although this boo is set in 50's-80's, it still is relevant in regards to todays youth.The idea of exploring manhood through the myth of the stolen child is a BRILLIANT idea. Donohue succeeds in telling the story well.His language and style, however, make it obvious that he is not yet in his linguistic prime. Hopefully he will follow with a second novel that is as intersting and well told, but will improve is means.Definitely worth the 50 page test."
2,Not that exciting,I was expecting more of a subtle plot with better character development due to the nature of the story (children who don't age until they go back out into the real world) - in my mind the story wasn't plausible. After a 100 years I would expect the characters to have more depth. I was bored with this novel and put it down around 2/3rds of the way through.
2,No connection,"I made it about 100 pages into the book, but I don't think I'll keep going. I found it very hard to connect or care about any of the characters in the novel. He tries so hard to be accurate on the horrible lives these changelings live both in the forest and once they return, that there is no humanity to connect with."
2,I'm not sure what this book was about,"Perhaps this is a novel for an older crowd, but I personally didn't get it, being 21 years old. I thought that story wasn't terrible, but considering how predictable, uneventful, and inconclusive it was, I would have expected that there would be some moving theme or message below the surface. But I still can't figure it out. What is it about growing up and identity that the author is saying? Is it that it sucks no matter what? I think that maybe I just don't have the life experience of ""growing up"" so I don't connect with this book. I wouldn't recommend this book for people who haven't grown up yet!"
1,Donohue has a tin ear,"The book deserves more stars than I have given it, but the praise others have heaped on this book has hardened my heart. Donohue has a tin ear -- his language strikes the wrong tone, again and again -- and his book has very little internal coherence. He has his unschooled wild children going to the library to read Flannery O'Conner and Wallace Stevens."
3,A little slow in the beginning,"I think the book is very well written; however, the story didn't really get interesting until I was about 2/3 through the book.I just didn't connect with the characters until later in the book. The author did a really good job of overlaying the 2 different perspectives of Henry Day and Aniday and it really became interesting in the end.Overall, I thought the book was very well written and I'm only giving the book a 3 because it did drag until 1/2-2/3 into the book. I've certainly read worse."
4,"Good, but not Great...","I saw this book written up in Newsweek a while back and added it to my wish list for future purchase. I finally got around to buying it and was able to read it in several sittings. It is well written, but doesn't capture the reader as do several other books I've reviewed. I'd definitely recommend it as a good read for adults, but not for any child who might be impressionable or easily upset. The book is interesting and worth reading, but it's not one I'll keep to add to my library."
1,Disappointing,"Afetr reading most of the reviews, I bought this book with great expectations. I can not believe there were so many positive reviews.My recommendation is don't waste your time, skip it!!!"
3,The Stolen Child,I thought this book would be a lot better. Never really pulled me in to the story. I would only buy the book if it was on sale.
4,Great Book for what it is,"I agree with the other reviewer that the ""simple writing"" actually detracts from the story and had wished there had been more depth in the prose. As a page turner it works extremely well as you want to know ""what happens"" next but for me there was little cause for me to pause and reflect on what I had read. If you want a book that will move you, I highly urge you to read The Book Thief. Don't miss that book this year. Don't let the fact that that book is listed as a young adult novel as I think it has been put in wrong category. Where as I think the Stolen Child would have been better place in the young adult category. While The Stolen Child is not great literature it is a satisfying read."
2,Did we all read the same book?,"My apologies to the author and take this critique with a grain of salt. But... this was worse than a mix of Children of Dune and Thanatopsis. Wow, what a bad book.Maybe it's just because I don't and didn't have coming of age issues growing up. Maybe its because I don't understand the horrible disconnect generation x felt from their parents or the desperate need for validation that generation y is haunted by.But... so its about a kid trapped at age 7 in someone elses body and another kid trying to fit in with the hobgoblins. *YAWN*There was a lot of potential here and while I tip my hat off to the author for his creative literary technique, I have to say that this book ranks as one of the least entertaining reads I have had in a while."
2,"Great premise, poor execution","I heard about this novel on NPR more than once, and while I'm not one for fantasy fiction, was intrigued by the premise. Indeed, the premise is terrific, but the prose and plotting compete with one another for obviousness and banality."
3,O-K,"I borrowed this book from the library after seeing the high ratings on Amazon. I am almost finished with it and I don't quite like it. It kind of drones on (not really in a boring way), but more in a mysterious way, like you want to find out what happens, and that's the only thing that really keeps you going, plus the fact that it's written pretty well. It seems like an interesting, unique story, but it's actually quite just dreary and different from most fairy tales. I found it a bit scary and honestly would not recommend it to someone."
4,who among us is one of them?,"It is a great novel, full of fantasy and fright!Fairies living among us, and not being quite the fairies we imagine! I found it entertaining and fun. It leaves you with a feeling of ""who is among us?""Filled with twists and turns, not wknowing what will happen next, creepy images that haunt you! Found it a bit slow at times that is why I rated it 4 stars, but in general it is amazing!"
4,Missed Credit...,"I have to agree with most of the reviews but need to add that none of these picked up on the obvious reference to the Irish poet, William Butler Yeats and his poem ""The Lost Child""."
2,not magical like I had hoped,"So many good reviews, I was SO excited for this book to arrive in the mail. This book is definitely not for everyone. I can see how it will relate to certain people but to me it was boring. In the beginning I was excited because the way things were described were almost poetic. The writing felt charming. Once the newness is over though the story, to me, just becomes a series of events, and not all that exciting of events. The book was altogether anti-climatic. It had it's moments but they were brief. While I have read worse books, I didn't finish those, so having said that I can tell you this is the most disappointing book that I've ever finished."
3,Just Doesn't Work for Me,"It's an interesting take on the whole changeling idea...and while I enjoyed the interplay between the two narratives (Henry Day as the Stolen Child living with the pack of ""hobgoblins"" and Henry Day the Hobgoblin trying to make peace with his new life)...but a lot of the narrative drags on unnecessarily and the entire life of the changlings is rather sad, bleak and depressing. It wasn't magickal, exciting or even just a little bit Peter Panish. It was a good read, but it never really took off and got exciting and the whole build up to the end never really paid off. It was ok...but not great. Should be interesting to see where this first time novelist goes in the future. I'd rate it about a C+ to maybe a B-."
5,an amazing imagination,"I do consider myself a slow reader and I read this book in 2 days. Keith Donohue is an outstanding writer. I was so lost in this book that when it came to the end, I was disapointed because it was not longer. Others who had borrowed the book from me felt the same. I do hope that he is planing on writing another book."
5,The best book I read in 2006!,"An AWESOME story - a rare and surprising story of a boy stolen by changelings, and of the changeling who replaced him. The parallel chapters, narrated by Aniday and by the new Henry Day, were very effective, and I was incredibly moved by this story."
3,A Fair Attempt,"Having read lots of science fiction and fantasy, and given the reviews in the paper, I expected more from this novel. The story was easy enough to follow, though the ending was disappointing and the writing style was confusing at times."
3,Kept me captivated,I just wish the the ending had more. I love the storyline but as a reader I wanted to know if he found his true love.
2,Where's the heart?,"My first impression of this book that it was very choppy and I did not like the way in which it was written at all. The plot has holes in it, and the characters were weakly described. It sort of reminds me of ""The Meq,"" another book I didn't care for. It is suprising the number of years that this book covers and yet, the past is, at times, agonizingly slow. The main thing that it lacks is heart. I just couldn't feel anything for the characters. With that said, I liked the idea, and I liked that the story was told from two view points. I am suprised how highly toted this book is, both by Amazon, and other authors whom I admire (Peter S. Beagle especially). This was a big miss in my eyes.***Updated*** Please read Solstice Wood by Patricia McKillip for a much better story about changlings and all things fay."
2,Disappointing,"I bought this because of amazon's ravings, and I thought a bit of fantasy would make a good summer read, but I was sorely disappointed. I don't know much about the changeling mythology, which may explain why I found the author's fairy world to make little sense--- a stolen child can't run home because the fairies will be really angry???! I did not find the author's style particularly impressive either. Lyrical? I found it very flat. A modern fairytale exploring themes of childhood fears and adult regrets? Maybe. I'll stick to the Grimms."
2,Leaves a lot to be desired...,"The idea sounded great! The story line has so much potential, yet never reached greatness nor anything close to that. Actually, it was just boring..."
2,Stolen Time,"Much overhyped. If you've read The Meq by Steve Cash it has a similar feel. Sort of plodding, no emotional connection to characters, just an ongoing narrative of events. At least it was short, but still, what was with all this arbitrary praise from everyone? If you must read it, get it at a library. It's barely a rental, not a must-buy."
1,less than engaging,I do like this genre of book and the premise was promising but the author didn't do a good enough job to keep me engaged. It lacked that unnameable something that makes a story a good story. I think the premise demanded an ethereal quality that the actual story lacked.
5,Finally!,"I have been sitting for months sifting through my old books lookng for an adventure or an experience to take me from the boredom of summer. While these books were great, it just wasn't the same as reading a book for the first time. Then I discovered ""The Stolen Child"" by Keith Donohue. This was the book that I had been waiting for. The wonderful fairy tale of Aniday and Henry Day entirely enthralled me, and the suprising twists and turns kept me never wanting to put this book down. A truly amazing read that I would recommend to anyone. Your summer won't be complete untill you read this."
1,This is no Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell,"With some books, reaching the end is bittersweet--you hate for it to end but happy to learn the conclusion. With The Stolen Child, reaching the end was just sweet. I bought this book because I really liked Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell, but this is not even close to the level of that book. Tee characters remain the same, the story drags on and on, and the writing is childish. For some reason, I decided I would finish this book, but it really deserved to be stopped 1/2 way through or better yet avoided all together. Don't make my mistake. Try Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell if you haven't read it and if you have, don't buy this thinking it might be as much fun. Not even close!"
3,"A book for ""Time Traveler's Wife"" and Gregory Maquire's ""Lost "" Fans","This is a book for those who loved, ""The Time Traveler's Wife"" by Audrey Niffenegger and ""Lost"" by Gregory Maquire. A morose meandering story that wallows in the neurosis and depression of the characters. While the premise and narrative style are both intriguing (similar to ""The Time Traveler's Wife), the more fantasic and supernatural details of the story are not as well developed and seem a bit flat, a la ""Lost"". Therefore, book will not find many fans among horror, gothic, sci-fi or other fantasy afficionados.After the expansive and personal narrative of the two Henry's, the ending leaves a certain psychological space to be filled in the reader. At the end of the book, I found myself searching for the last chapter that must have inadertantly been edited out."
4,Don't mistake this for a Fantasy,"Descriptions of this book led me to believe it was a fantasy. It is actually a story of childhood, how childhood shapes one's life, and the importance of children in our society. A thought provoking and unusual book."
4,Thar's creatures in the forest!,"A pretty bittersweet tale, a ""what if"" there were little evilish fairies in the forest stealing & swapping places with children. What happens to a child and a fairy when lives are swapped and the long reaching effects. A nice summer read. Not Tolkien, but clever and original."
5,Loved it!,"Loved it, loved it, loved it.Did I mention I loved it!?Rarely comes a book that I can make that claim about. Can not wait for another release from this author!"
3,Adult Fairytale,"I enjoyed it but it was one of those books where I kept waiting for the ""big thing"" to happen. It was a little sad and erie but OK."
4,Excellent Story,"I really enjoyed ""The Stolen Child"". I was intrigued by the description given on Amazon.com. I was not disappointed. I felt sorry for Aniday and, at times, mad at Henry Day for taking his childhood away. The saving grace is the love that Aniday finds. I loved the characters and the two versions told by the main characters. I would love to see this book in a movie version, although movie versions rarely live up to the book. A must read."
3,"Pleasant, but could be better...","Like many people here, I enjoyed the book. Liked the idea. And unlike many people, I actually like the ending. I think it shows that once you accept who you are, you can begin to enjoy it. It also shows that there are good sides to be found in any situation: no matter how miserable you think your life is.What I did not like, is that both Henrys speak as the same person, and this person is an English literature professor. Which is not likely with one of them in the forest (even with some trips to the library), and another saying at some point that he does not read at all. And I had a strong impression that one character is growing (the child in the forest), while another stays the same (the one in real world). But maybe it was the author's intention all along?"
3,A Decent Read...,This book took me a long time to read. It was not a page turner as I think I expected. The chapters jump back and forth to the two different characters which is a fine concept if done well. These characters and names were mildly complicated and at times it was hard to switch gears like that. I also expected a different ending...something more exciting.I do give the author credit for a wonderfully unique story idea...it's what makes this an interesting read.
1,A lot of hype for a disappointing book,"I generally enjoy the fairy-tale type novel, even modern day fairy tales appeal. But this novel attempts to charm and beguile and instead just drags on endlessly with little point and no charm whatsoever. The premise is interesting, if ghoulish, the hobgoblins steal a child and take over it's life while the ""stolen child"" becomes a hobgoblin and waits for his turn to reenter another person's life perpetuating the cycle. The potential is there for interesting and perhaps even comical situations as each character becomes accustomed to their new lives, but instead neither character ever becomes accustomed and the feelings are disconnected, jarring and hollow. Nothing ever happens except more stumbling and emotionless action. The characters are almost completely unsympathetic and the reader simply keeps reading in the hope the SOMETHING will actually happen. It never does.Seldom am I completely disappointed in a book but this is one I advise everyone to skip."
4,lovely,"I thought the book was beautifully written, although, how a child with a first year education can obtain such skill with a stub pencil is beyond me. The story was heartfelt, strange, and a more than a bit scary at some points. This is not a typical faery tale, mind you. I didn't like the ending because it left too many unanswered questions concerning Aniday, whereas Henry's life problems were solved. I'm not quite sure why this book deserved such an outpouring of hits and buys. Granted, it is pretty good, but I've read authors which much more skill and practice."
4,Wonderful storytelling,A well-written and well crafted tale appears magical when it is finally presented to the world and one finally gets to sit down and read and get lost in the story. Keith Donohue has created such magic with the prose in this book. I really enjoyed it and look forward to reading more from this author.
5,The Stolen Child,"I found this book in a little out of the way bookstore in Berkeley, CA. I was both fasinated and drawn in to the story immediately. I had never read this kind of fiction. I was pleasantly surprised and want more! Will you be adding another book with this genre from the cast of characters?"
3,Caught between a failed fantasy and a far-fetched coming-of-age Tale,"I read a LOT. While I really likeed the plot and the first few chapters showed promise, I found it all very misleading. It never really caught the spark and thrill of a fantasy book and for a tale on growing up i felt that it wasn't thoughtful enough. In fact it got rather boring. I really did not feel that care or concern about the characters for the ending to hold much sway.When I read about this book I was expecting more of a fantasy book with some action in it. For a more purposeful coming-of-age story try ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower""."
2,The writing was very flat,"I bought this book on the basis of a review I read in Newsweek. It really didn't live up to expectations. I've read lots of contemporary fiction and lots of fantasy, and this excelled in neither category. The writing was very flat; the characters were not at all engaging, and it lacked any kind of compelling voice or style. As a coming-of-age novel, you could do much better."
2,hmmm chemicals on fish ?,"While the taste was ok, i wish i had seen the ingredient list. I just had a case of polar kippers, with only salt added, and i assumed these would be the same.the polar ones are better, but they went up in price , and the crown prince are good, but not as good as the polar. But these - you can taste a chemical. ...and therefore...i would avoid them"
5,ABSOLUTELY DYNAMIC!,"This album is wonderfully refreshing! The lyrics, the melodies, the flavor...Every part of this album is awesome! And I especially love how she speaks directly to the Believer! Lejuene, thanks so much for allowing the Lord to use this album to truly inspire me and remind me that I am His child, and He deserves all of my praise!"
3,Practice makes Perfect,"I bought this CD witht the intent to get the same reaction every one had when they bought this CD. I, on the other hand gave this CD 3 stars b/c I thought the CD was okay, but not awful either. There are a few songs I like-How can You Walk Away, and Heaven. The remix of the Clark Sisters was ok also. Lejuene has a beautiful voice no doubt, but I think some of her songs could have been a little better. I didn't like the beats or the actual music to her songs. Never the less as said before, Lejuene has a beautiful voice...she definately reminds me of Kim Burell. Her voice range is off the hook."
2,Anticlimax,"I am a Tri-City fan, and especially fond of a few lead singers - Lejuene being one of them. I was so excited when I heard she had a new cd out, I could hardly wait to tear the wrapping and listen to what i knew would be comparable to Kim Burrell and Karen Clark-Sheard's projects, but it wasn't. I was sooooo disappointed, because I know this sister loves God, and has been blessed with a truly powerful, phenomenal voice. I mean, she can really sing. Forreal. But it wasn't evident throughout most of the cd. With her husband's backing and Donald's blessing, they could have done much better. She fell prey to this recent trend in gospel music when talented artists tread the r&b, hip-hop, and yet i'm still saved line. It was way too much and far too little; not enough traditional where her anointing could really flow. Sorry, Lejuene. I still love you and will buy your next cd (after a sampling, of course). But the one I have now is collecting dust..."
4,Good bio and sampler,"The biography that opens this volume is short but well reasoned. Rebenich attempts to give a new view of Jerome: revising, for example, the common picture of his lonely sojourn in the desert to one of a man living on a country estate with a team of copyists (although he did no doubt spend some time in solitary meditation). The texts have been selected to show the range of Jerome's literary activities. There is also a good bibliography. On the whole, I would recommend this book overKelly's excellent biographyas a first book on Jerome, simply because it is impossible to understand the man without reading more extensive excerpts from his writings than Kelly provides."
2,Purely a costume belt,"I received this belt as a present (off my wish list). The buckle has a nice enough look, but the belt was cheesy from the start with unfinished edges on the retaining loop and made of very thin material. After one wearing, the eyelet was tearing free and the surrounding naugahyde material was deformed. I wore the belt maybe 15 hours this year and it is ready for the trash bin. The buckle still looks fine, it's a shame the belt couldn't keep pace. If you buy this item, just be aware that you are more likely 'renting' it at a rate of $2 per hour!"
4,Santa Belt nice,"The buckle on this is the star. Beautiful bright gold and decorated with holly leaves. Really sets off the santa suit. Belt itself is ok, but a patent leather one would be better. I got the XL and had to cut it and reattach to buckle as it was really big on a 40"" waist. The large would probably be better. Even with his padding Santa couldn't fill it out."
4,Worth the price,"This is a good business quality scanner. Duplex mode, batch scanner that handles card stock. Plenty of options for profile settings."
5,honda accord manuelservice,it took a while to get the manuel but it was worth it.it was as advertised and arrived in good shape.thank you
5,The best book for all you do it your selfers,This is one of the best books for all of you do it yourselfers. Save yourself a lot of TIME and MONEY with this book. When i bought this book it saved me at least so far about 20 hours worth of looking around for the wrong thing! You can save yourself money by not having to take your car to a mechanic to get the simple stuff done. Defintly buy this book!
4,A good book for DIY,"This book is a must have for the DIY. Almost all areas are covered, from body work to electronic, engine, central console, etc. I don't have the original service manual, which cost over $60, but I think this book is already good enough for most of the tasks.However, some photos are not very clear and some diagrams do not clearly identify which part of the engine it is drawing, and you will have to find it by yourself."
3,It could use more details and pictures.,I was interested mainly in door replacement information and could have used more detailed information and illustrations. It was generally helpful.
5,"M&M's = ""They DO Exist!""","In case no one understands my review title, it refers to the M&M commercial where Santa runs into the M&M's and the M&M's say, ""He does exist"" and Santa says, ""They do exist!"" Anyway ..... This game is for my childhood friend that collects ""anything M&M's"" I have not given it to her yet, since we always get together a couple months after Christmas when everything has died down. She will adore this game, I don't believe she has it. I haven't opened it since it is a gift, but the contents shown on the box look awesome and the board looks cool! Anyone who collects M&M's stuff or Monopoly Games should have it!"
3,Plenty of activities,It works great for me because it has the same activities in English and Spanish side by side. For the Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS) works fine.
3,Broad Brushstrokes,"I took a chance and ordered this book based on fellow reader reviews. I just finished it and find myself wanting more. I liked both of the protagonists but I feel things were a little ""rushed"" in this book. The characters were one dimensional and painted with broad brushstrokes. Ms. North goes to a great deal of trouble to create an extended family that we never see again. I will say this though, Ms. North does an excellent job creating dialog between the children and the adults. That's my two cents worth."
5,I was so sad when this book ended I wanted more More MORE,It is a great book but I was so sad when this book ended. I just felt like I was getting to know the characters and I didn't want to put the book down. i wanted to find out just what happened with Parker and Meg. There were a few strings left untied... maybe there will be a sequel in the future... I want to know more about what happens to them...
3,A nice get-away,"I actually thought this was a pretty good book, though it was slow getting started. I was constantly wondering how everything was going to work out. It's an easy read with enough twists to make it interesting. The front cover does boast that it's ""fast and funny"". I don't remember anything particularly funny about the book, so if you're looking for a good laugh, this is not it, but it is a nice, light book if you just want to read something for once where there's not something terrible happening. It is a great romance read with some nice erotic scenes as well."
3,Kids Review (Angelcia 6 years old),"I have a Pixel Boutique and the 2 story house, but I don't have the Beverly Hills Mansion yet. My mommy is buying the mansion today. The Pixel Boutique is kind of normal but mean and the 2 story house is cute. I hope the Beverly Hills Mansion will be better then my boutique. I'll send a review once I received the Mansion house. I was playing with my two other Pixels today and guess what one of them (the boutique) stuck her tongue at me and made faces. I'm telling you girlfriends send your money back is she is mean to you!!!"
4,So much fun!,"I love this thing! It's so much fun! I just enabled the dating option, and I laughed so hard when the guy gave her a rose and she just said, ""Thank you,"" with almost no emotion! I love the cat and the dog! The dancing and guitar games are fun, too! My brother loves it, too! I wonder if they'll ever make a guy version... it could be called Digital Dudes! Hee hee!"
5,IT sounds like fun,I BET i WOULD LOVE THIS GAME I ORDER IT. PEOPLE SAY IT IS A BATTERY GOBBLER SO i AM GONING TO GO WITH THERE ADVICE AND BUYA BIG PACK OF BATTERYS.
3,Over Priced!,"My daughter obviously loves this toy after playing with it at a toy store but it's way too expensive. Thank God I can afford to spend lots of money on my princess but I refuse to indulge her every desire. If other children are the same, which I bet they are, this ""cool"" toy is going to be close to the bottom of the toy box in less than a month. I am much more willing to spend my money on similar toys that are ""cool"" and less expensive. Bring the price down and I'll be the first in line to buy the Pixel Chics."
2,OMG!!!IT IS LIKE SOOOOOO COOOLL!!!!,IT IS SO WORTH YOR $ B/C U NEVER GET BORED @ ALL u CAN DO ANYTHING W/ IT!OMG!ITS LIKE SOOO COOOL!!rATING:5STARS ALL THE WAY! AGES 9-13!
5,Gotta Have It,I would recommend this toy for girls 7 and up.Its so cool to take care of the girls inside the house.Pixel chix is worth the $30 because you never get bored of it and can take it on the go.
1,60 mph to 0 mph in one day!,"This toy came out hopping and left my girls VERY disappointed. It's such a cool idea with witty things for the ""chix"" to do. But within one day (two hours of play), the batteries went dead with no warning, the ""chix"" had met most goals and the girls were bummed. We tried to reset and start over but we were going through batteries like crazy. One finally just stopped working altogether. I hope they get the glitches worked out. Until, then this ""chick"" passes on those ""pixel chix"""
1,BORING!!!!,"We thought this would be better than Tamagotchi's, but WE WERE WRONG!! These get boring really fast, not many choices of things to do (wear or eat), and the ""games"" aren't even games at all (just answering a phone or eating and watching TV). I don't understand how kids can play with this all day long; they must be just doing the same boring things over and over. At least Tamagotchis have real games and you can buy things for them (and you can pause the games). Pixel Chix is a cute idea, if only they did more to hold our attention."
3,Pixel Chix,"I got this for my eight year old for Christmas. She loves it. I am not so sure. The portability is great. We have had to reset it 3 times since she got it Christmas day. The instructions says it will react to photostatic, so we are waiting to see if there is a pattern before we decide if to return it. It is a cute game. Too bad no volume control."
3,This Toy Scared My Children,"Well, it started out like a normal night. Then the ghosts came out and the girl had ""x"" on her eyes and she started vomiting. This isn't the first time this has happened to a toy in our house. In fact, even if the toy is completely inanimate, it still happens. Personally, I like the toy. I think that the change from being all light and happy to glum and dismal is rather great. We were going to return it, but then I thought, hey, my kids can learn that if you don't feed yourself and bathe then you will have ghosts flying around you too. So, it stays."
1,I thought 5 stars:(,I thought when I shelled out $30 for it would be awesome.But sadly I was wrong.Pixel Chix is fun for the first hour or so but soon its boring because you accurique the items much too quickly.Then the game started over once then it countied to start over and over.I got my 30 well earn dollars back after returning it to TRU .My advice : save the $$$ for swapping styles a much better toy for the dough.
3,Snotty Chix,"I think this is an enjoyable toy/game, especially when trying to entertain siblings on long drives. Kids can link their pixel chix houses together and then play together.Be warned though; pay attention to the age recommendation and also note that the virtual chix are similar to virtual pets. You MUST feed and play with them.My five, soon-to-be-six year old, was crushed when she turned on her toy after not playing with it while we were on vacation. The character stuck her tongue out at my daughter, grabbed her suitcase and moved out. My daughter burst into tears, feeling that she left her little friend to starve. I'm sure she won't end up in therapy as an adult because of it, but the point is that young kids won't get the humor.Also, your older child might bug you to play it for them to prevent the same thing. You can tell your character to go to bed when you're tired of playing, but there are level up consequences."
4,Pixel Chix Beverly Hill House,"Fun Fun Fun!!! I got this for my 4 year old daughter and she loves it! She plays with it most every day, and usually several times a day. She realizes that she must care for the girl in the house and keep her company...and amazingly enough she dosen't forget. This is not a toy that a child plays with a few times and then lays down never to be played with again. It is also very durable."
3,"Cutest Toy Ever, But with a Few Glitches","I bought the Pixel Chix Beverly HIlls House for my 8-year-old for Christmas. It is such a cute toy, and she was thrilled. One of her cousins also got one, and they had a terrific time playing with them together. They couldn't seem to hook them up successfully because the cousin said she'd been playing with hers all day and was on ""level 3,"" whereas my daughter was only on ""level 1"" and they would have to be on the same level to interract. Is this true? She also complained about the toy being a battery guzzler, and that has proved to be true. In three hours of play, we had to replace the batteries. Also, at one point, the toy just ""zoned out,"" and my daughter lost all of the progress she had made and had to start at the beginning all over again by pressing the reset to get it to start up. If anyone has run into these problems and knows any tricks for improving the toy's performance, I'd love to know. Aside from my complaints, my daughter loves this toy."
2,Over Priced Dust Collecter,"10 y/o daughter had birthday money burning a hole in her purse. She enjoys Tamagotchis and thought she'd try this. It was her birthday money, so even when I balked at the price tag...it did not deter her from getting it. I think she played with it for a few hours total. It's been over a month since she bought it. I have not seen it and have no idea where it is. Probably in some deep dark drawer where all the other unwanted, over priced, mind numbing gadgets are tossed. I'm sure the pixel ""chic"" has died from neglect by now. (If they do die, I have no idea). I guess I'll be listing this with all the other things on ebay soon. Check there for a great deal on this wonderful. fun toy! (That was for resale purposes only and not to distract from the actual waste of money this toy truly is :)"
4,When Friends become liabilities!,"Let's face it, most true crime books today are about spouses who kill. In this book, Phelps uncovers and write about Gary Charles Evans, a little known serial killer and burglar of antiques in New England. For the most part, Gary C. Evans is a complicated criminal. He can survive in the wilderness but can't survive prison life. He killed three of his best childhood friends who were his partners in crime rather than face jailtime. Maybe he thought that he wanted to see what he could get away with crimewise. With a determined police detective like Jim Horton, he gets his man after he ran for his life."
3,"Should be subtitled ""Keystone Cops Get Lucky""","A fair read, but much too long--more than anyone would want to know about Gary Evans. It also shows, however, how a plea-bargaining system rife with expediency fails to protect us. And that a rare book is worth more than lives :(."
5,"I love it, I love it, I love it","Well, a friend told me to read this book, I'm not much into true crime. Well after reading this book, I must say I need to start reading more of these books. This book really is a page turner. I could not put it down. The author does a great job in capturing the readers immediate attention. I like that style. Some books take a few chapters for you too get hooked. Not the case here. Gary Evans is one crazy s.o.b. They have to make this into a movie, it really is an incredible story. Mr Phelps, you now have a new fan. I guess I'll have to read your other books mow. Great job !"
4,"Three Legged ""Dogs"" Ain't Half Bad!","With the untimely passing of Gene Eugene, I wondered how well the next project from Lost Dogs would turn out, or if they would even continue to record without him. 'Real Men Cry' definitely lacks Gene's contribution, but with Terry Taylor's creative genius, it is a toe-tapping collection of country style numbers with a touch of bluegrass (In fact, every time I listen to the CD, I picture myself sitting on the front porch in a rocking chair with a cold glass of lemonade in hand, head bobbing in rhythm to the music). Harmonic vocals and great guitar work permiate each track. And once again, Terry's lyrical talent shines. NO SHADOW OF TURNING is my favorite tune, but A CERTAIN LOVE comes in a close second. I get the impression that Terry was thinking of the band when he penned THREE LEGGED DOG and it seems he's returning to his 'roots' with the style of music performed on this and the last project 'Gift Horse'."
2,No character growth or development; some good writing.,"I suspect the tag lines about ""hip hop"" are to bring you into the novel, though, this book had very little to do with hip hop; even tangentially. Not a particularly good book, but the story is a good one and rich with possibilities - it's the plot that doesn't quite work. None of the characters were remotely interesting and if you're going to fill a novel with so much angst and unhappiness there needs to be a balance or character growth in the process and there was none here. All characters (major and minor) lacked any growth, development, or an ""ah ha"" moment and maybe that was the point of the novel. Some of the writing, however, is very good - you can see the author has talent. The story is timely and needed, but you may have to look a little further for a cohesive and compelling tale of being gay in the hip hop culture of the 1990's."
2,"""OEM"" ipod earbud headphones?","the ad said OEM ipod earbuds headphones and the picture looks like the real thing. they looked more like the real thing than some of the other ones offered on Amazon, but when I received the earbuds I thought the cord was a little long. so I barrowed a friend's pair of REAL earbuds and compared the two. four(could be more) things that I found wrong were...1)the cord was indeed about 2in longer, 2)the place where the cord splits into two and enters the actually earbud piece in the ear is longer than the REAL thing, 3)the speaker in each earbud is different than the REAL thing, 4)there is no sliding piece on the headphones that lengthens and shortens the earpieces. it was a close replica of the REAL OEM ipod earbuds, but upon closer examination, NOT the real thing."
2,...same as what the person below me said,"They aren't the real thing. And they don't sound like the real ones, either (not that the real ones sound fantastic or anything, but they sound better than these). Just go to the apple store and buy the real ones."
4,Good for singles and small families!,"I wanted a book that would help me make better use of my combination counter top oven. The recipes are really good and the portions are perfect. I plan to makes good use of this book in both my full size oven and my countertop. Although my goal is to not use the big oven if I don't have to.The author suggests use of a food processor in many of the recipes which, if you have one, encourages the use of an appliance that often sits on the counter unused in many kitchens. If you don't have one, consider getting a small 3 to 7 cup model. They are affordable, take up less space and very quickly become indispensable on a daily basis.I'm happy with this intelligently written recipe book."
5,I love it!,I am enjoying reading through this cookbook and am happily planning what I will make first. It seems like it has a very good selection of recipes.
2,Should be called The Gourmet Toaster Oven AND FOOD PROCESSOR,"Who writes a book about recipes for a toaster oven and then throws in a bunch of requirements for a food processor? I don't own a food processor, and if I did, I probably wouldn't be looking at recipes for a toaster oven. Had I known beforehand the recipes were going to be this way, I never would have bought the book. I will say it's beautifully illustrated. But I've owned it about a year, and have never used it to make a single thing."
3,Some culinary experience required,"I din't like the overall formal reading.It promised a lot of pictures... there were some.I would recommend it to people that, already know, how to cook."
2,I wish there were more photos,"I love using my toaster oven to make things, and was extremely excited about this book. But I'm a visual person and it's hard to be motivated to try out these recipes because most of them do not have photos. So if you like to see what you're about to make, I don't recommend this cookbook."
1,The Gourmet Toaster Oven,"I was very disappointed with this book and I am in the process of returning it for a refund. It advertises as a ""simple yet sophisticated"" cookbook... Well, it may be sophisticated, but simple, it is not. Many recipes call for ingredients which are not readily available for the average, working person (really, who buys buttermilk anymore? Give me a break!). The cooking instructions are involved (marinating and soaking overnight, making ""tapinade"", etc.) This may be great for the individual who has lots of time on their hands; it is useless for a person who works full time, and has a family, and just wants to make something simple, but tasty and healthy, in their toaster oven. This book would be great for a coffee table, but in the kitchen, it's a dud."
1,Refund never submitted,I ordered this product from this company through Amazon.com. After checking my current unit I found a cable became loose and I did not need the merchandise. I tried to cancel the order via email and was told I was to late to stop the order but I could try to refuse the delivery for a full refund. I was not home when the item was delivered and the carrier left it at the door. I contacted the company again and the sent a return confirmation slip. I took the item to UPS as instructed on Jan 13th. I have not received credit for my return as of today January 29th.
2,"Works great, but scroll wheel on mouse won't work.","If you like using the scroll wheel, forget it, I'm taking mine back for one that supports a wheel mouse."
3,Does not work with Vista and Microsoft wireless keyboard,"The switch worked fine with my xp laptop but did not work at all with my Vista desktop with a Microsoft wireless keyboard. Heard different responses from Belkin support but finally appeared to be incompatible with Vista and the Wireless keyboard. The switch worked fine when I plugged in a wired keyboard. Was not willing to give up my Microsoft Natural Wireless keyboard for the sake of the switch. So, returned this one and bought a IOGEAR (GCS42UW6) switch which is compatible.Wish the product info mentioned incompatible hardware setups clearly. Could have saved me plenty of time and effort.Prospective buyers please make sure that your hardware setup is compatible with this device before making the purchase. I was told some Microsoft and Logitech wireless keyboards and mice are not compatible with this switch.Hope that helps."
4,"Charming tale, good detail.. should have been longer","The tale itself is well done, De Lint is always a masterful storyteller. The world he brings alive is robust, diverse and very reminscent of the cyberpunk genre. The only problem with the book is i think it should have been longer. About half way through i felt as if i was being dragged through the plot, and it started to get predictable as the pace picked up. When i finished, it was very anti-climactic. Still, its a beautiful tale - i like the style of telling a story from several viewpoints - its not done enough."
2,Not his best,"Like other reviewers here, I love Mr. de Lint's work. His more recent books, particularly, have great characters and a clear-sighted take on human nature. This one, however, was full of predictable stereotypes and painfully bombastic Japanese. (I'm surprised and a bit appalled that the editor didn't address this.) Unless you're a diehard de Lint fan, you can skip <u>Svaha</u>."
2,Not worth the money,"This book is way too expensive for what you get. Most of the forms you can find on the internet. They go into great detail about office procedures and paper work which is good, but that was most of the book. If your looking for in dept pet sitting advice I would buy ""Pet Sitting for Profit"", it's actually a much better book."
2,Pet Sitting Guide,I thought this book was just average. It is very over priced for what the book actually has to offer.
4,Very helpful,The Professional Pet Sitter was full of helpful information that helped me get my buisness going. This book helped bring to my attention some issues about starting a buisness I might have otherwise overlooked.
1,This is NOT the Rodney Atkins CD!!!,"If you're looking for the Rodney Atkin's album with ""Cleaning this Gun"" then go to here:If You're Going Through Hell. This album, ""Pickin' on Rodney Atkins"" is NOT by Rodney Atkins, but is instead a cleverly marketed and placed banjo-only rip of his music. Suffice to say, I didn't read the fine details, but didn't figure I needed to do so because it was the #1 item returned in the Amazon search when I searched on Rodney Atkins. Be forewarned: there are no vocals on the disc, and frankly, it's really very boring (what's Atkins' without the lyrics?!?)."
5,Holding My Heart!!,"When I first sat down with Holding the Ladder, I had no idea of the emotional journey I was about to undertake. Nancy Bailey is an excellent tour guide. She reaches into the heart and soul of Avery, and presents her journey of grief and resolution with uncommon empathy, compassion, realism, and even humor. By the end of this book, I was avowed Nancy Bailey fan. I look forward to future books by this author. Holding the Ladder is a wonderful novel!!"
4,"Holding the Ladder, a struggle shared","Nancy Bailey does a marvelous job in this short novel describing a heartbreaking loss of life, love and friendship as well as the joy of each. Based upon events that she is all too farmiliar with, the book walks one through the crushing loss of love and reestablishment of relationships which must withstand, or not, the trials of tragedy. Nancy has an uncanny sense of symbolism and is not unpoetic in her rendering of this episode taken from her own experience. It is well worth the investment of time and attention to share these moments with her."
5,Absolutely recommend,"Although I am a relatively new member of the Jane Austen fan club, I have been reading my fair share of fan-fiction. This first book in Pamela Aiden's trilogy takes you through the first section of Pride & Prejudice from Darcy's eyes. Pamela Aiden brings Darcy to life."
2,A book for a well-defined audience,"This book is Fan Fiction, pure and simple. If you will devour anything just to get more of Jane Austen, you may as well try this series, and check out Stephanie Barron's ""Jane Austen"" murder mysteries. Barron more closely approximates the Austen style.As for me, I find the writing sententious and tedious. And why is it that Jane Austen, or another favorite, Anthony Trollope, could write long paragraphs spelling out a scene in detail, without merely presenting sentences full of words but devoid of meaning? I find that I put down this book for a moment, and cannot find my place when I look at the page again because the words are not put together in a manner that seizes the eye.Again, if you like to read novelizations of classic movies, or the endless ""Star Wars"" books, you will probably find these books appealing. I may not finish the first one."
3,Fairly reasonable retelling,"I was interested in Darcy's point of view in falling in love with Elizabeth. I ended up enjoying this book but felt a little like Darcy fell too hard too fast. I know he must really care for Elizabeth to put himself out there as the story moves along but it seemed a bit strained. Also, the author adds many extra Darcy/Elizabeth moments that Austen never had and even extends some scenes longer than Austen did. This is tolerable though, because often it adds to the story and provides more interactions. :)"
5,Great Buy,"This is the first book in a three part series. I enjoyed the book and the whole series tremendously. While Aidan is true to the original story and characters, she adds her own flavor of interesting characters. She describes exactly what is going on with Darcy in Pride and Prejudice from the beginning aquaintance with Elizabeth. She fills in his side of the story enjoyably and realistically. A nice, easy read. Very fulfilling for the avid Jane Austen fan. After finishing this book in the series, I couldn't wait to read the other two."
2,Ridiculously short,"This book was good reading except that the print is large, it is not very long and the story ends with Darcy leaving the area with Bingly, as in not very far into the timeline of the original Pride & Prejudice story. Then you're expected to buy at least another couple of small books, large print to complete the entirety of the Pride and Prejudice tale. That was a turn-off, an obvious splitting of a average size story into three parts so you will buy more books. Get Mr. Darcy's Diary by Grange...much better read and complete within itself."
5,Best Variation,"Bought and Read over a year ago, still rates No.1 on my Austen variation list. Even if you take out the Austen factor it still provides an interesting read. Much like the Edward account of ""Twilight""."
5,A 'must' for any Jane Austen fan,"If you are dying to read more about Lizzy and Darcy in between readings of ""Pride and Prejudice"" then this is the book for you! I love how Aidan uses the actual text from P&P and ties in this whole separate world of Mr Darcy's that is actually interesting! At times I did wonder if the feelings Aidan described Darcy to be feeling were a little too 'feminine'. I don't know if men would really struggle with their feelings as much as Mr Darcy did but, it's romantic to read anyway. I also liked how Aidan seemed to use scenes or particular 'visions' from the BBC version of P&P. It really helped with the visualization of the story and makes watching the movie even more exciting! I will definitely read this again and again."
5,THE BEST novel on Mr Darcy and on P&P from his perspective,"I've read all three novels in this series by Pamela Aidan. Ms Aidan is a wonderful writer. Her success in writing an interesting and new book about Pride and Prejudice from Mr Darcy's point of view is amazing. She is not only accurate in quoting Jane Austen's novel, she is very acurate on writing in the romantic style of the period. She intimately knows all the characters of P&P and how they would talk or react to different events. Anyone who likes Jane Austen's style will be pleased to read this novel and the other two in the series."
5,A MUST for Austen Fans!,"This is truly a wonderful book! Being both a doctoral candidate in 18th-century literature and a hopeless romantic, I was extremely gratified to find that this book satisfied both of these aspects. It is rare that a modern author can emulate the style and expound on the story of such a great writer as Austen, but Aidan accomplishes this admirably. For devoted Austen fans as well as those who are new to her works, this book is a wonderful interpretation of Mr. Darcy, thus making it an excellent companion to Austen's original work. Aidan stays true to the spirit of Pride and Predjudice but also takes the reader on an exciting journey into Mr. Darcy's mind and actions, no little feat, considering the enigmatic nature of his character. This is definitely the best of all the Pride and Predjudice sequels/additions, and I would recommend it as the best book I have read in quite a while!"
5,The elusive Darcy meets his match,"Ever wonder what Darcy was thinking in Pride and Prejudice? Pamela Aiden gives us Pride and Prejudice from Darcy's point of view. The cool headed Mr. Darcy's composure is breeched by the witty, graceful and lovely Elizabeth Bennet. Darcy is caught in a dilemma between being a ""man of property"" of high social status, and his desire for a woman that out classes the women of his class.We get to meet some of Darcy's people, like Fletcher the Shakespeare quoting valet, and the ever faithful butler, Wicher. I esp. enjoyed the behind the scenes machininations of Fletcher attempting to aid Darcy in his campaign to win Miss Elizabeth's heart. Darcy's disdain for Caroline Bingley is also very amusing.Ms. Aiden also gives the reader an interesting view of Darcy's high class world. I await the next in this series of books with anticipation."
5,Wonderful P&P Version Through Darcy's Eyes! Love it!,I love this version of Pride and Prejudice as told through Darcy's perspective instead of Elizabeth's. I love that the author expanded upon the scenes in the P&P; Novel and gave us a deeper understanding of Darcy's character and emotions as they evolve over time and yet the author stayed faithful to the book and characters.I would highly recommend this novel trilogy to any fan of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice! It's definitely worth adding to your collection.
5,truly enjoyable,"Finally on paper the 1st part of a new, still in progress, austenian 'novel' which goes far beyond the average fanfiction and compliments almost perfectly Pride & Prejudice. If you ever missed anything in the best JA masterpiece, and usually is more in depth analysis of Darcy's feelings and what he did when not in the tale, now you have it in this most likely reconstruction of the Darcy's side of the romance. It is not a prequel, it is not a sequel: it is the true P&P in a male and modern perspective. Very well designed and even better written. Enjoy. I couldn't wait for its availability in Europe for having it in my hands."
5,A Well done Pastiche,"This pastiche of Pride and Prejudice tells basically the same story as Pride and Prejudice but from a different viewpoint. Ms. Aidan has rounded out Jane Austen's hero Fitzwilliam Darcy to give him a background, and a view into the thoughts and emotions behind Ms. Austen's stoic exterior.While no one can ever replace Jane Austen's masterpiece, she remained unmarried through her unfortunately short life. I find her male characters to be much weaker than her female characters. With Ms. Aidan I find that her descriptions of men somewhat better. (I'm not so sure that any female could understand males any better than male writers understand the female mind.)These books have been well received, and deservedly so. Not, perhaps, the classics that Jane Austen produced, but an enjoyable read."
1,Not at all how I would see Darcy,"I bought the trilogy after all the rav reviews. This was a hard book to swallow. I forced myself to read the first and trying to get through the second. What I question is if the people that actually wrote a good review read P&P? The biggest part that I disagree with completely is that Darcy had a bigger hand in the separating of Charles and Jane! I would not think him to be that low. I imagined Darcy giving advice to Charles against the match once. I never pictured him to plot and plan with Miss Bingley, who he really could not stand, to keep Charles and Jane apart! How Charles is going to forgive him in the 3rd book is beyond me. If you want Darcy's true feelings re-read (or to some read for the first time) the original P&P. You will see Darcy's struggle with his feelings through Austen's version. He shows through his actions how much he loves Lizzy. Leave this one alone!"
5,Is an excellant read,I had just finished P&P the day after this book arrived. It is an awesome perspective from Darcy view. It captivated me. I enjoyed it so much that I finished it in three days time. Now onto Book 2.
1,A travesty such as this...,"I was severely disappointed with this book - after reading so many good reviews of it, I was sorry to discover that it was insipid and drab from page one. I felt the author's portrayal of Darcy was completely untrue to Austin's novels, and her use of language was awkward, confounding and improper. I expected an intriguing look into a complex man and instead was handed a limp, wheedling shadow of Austin's character. The author tried to capture the essence of Regency language without the artistry to carry it off. This author's editor needed a better red pen - this book would have been much better with a few less trips to the thesaurus, a few more trips to the dictionary, and a few more nods to Jane Austin's contemporaries (and not to Georgette Heyer).*sigh*"
1,Don't waste your money,"I cannot understand the good reviews people give this book. Only the bad ones I agree with. She has twisted all the characters into aliens: Darcy, Elizabeth, Bingley....they don't resemble the characters I love. They don't speak or think anything like P&P. When she steals the lines from P&P they look jarring on the page! It deserves 0 star. I have found ALL sequals to Jane Austen's work awful! They are like Harlequin romance books, and all poorly written! If you are a true fan, re-read her works and get a deeper appreciation of her genius. If you are really curious, borrow it from the library, don't waste your time and money buying this thing."
5,eye opener,"i was so fascinated to keep reading this even though you know the story and its outcome, it made me buy book 2 and book 3 and have recommended them to friends who also love all 3."
4,Very Entertaining,It was nice to read a believable version of P&P from Darcy's perspective. I can't wait for the two remaining volumes.
5,An Assembly Such as This,"Pamela Aidan is a fabulous writer and she has captured the Austen genre, added some sex appeal, yet still remains within the spirit of 19th century England. Can't wait for the next two volumes."
2,Fair reading,"This book is ok,but it really stretches Darcy's character. Given his reserved character I cannot see him allowing himself to be so easily involved in some of the things he did. it is really a letdown. I thought it would be more on his thoughts of Miss Elizabeth."
5,Darcy's delightful viewpoint,An Assembly Such As This gives the reader a view of Darcy's mind and modivation--expanding upon the pride or prejudice theme... delving into his thoughts and reasoning. The book tickles the fancy of Austen or Darcy lovers. It's rather difficult to believe that a little lady from Idaho penned this fine work. Delightful!
4,Pleasantly Surprised,"I am not the type of person who usually goes in for ""fan-fiction"" but I really enjoyed this series. There were moments when I felt the characters were a bit over dramatic or when I was just sick of Darcy's endless inner monologs, but I really loved the perspective Pamela Aidan added to the traditional Pride and Prejudice story.I can sympathize with the people who felt this book was boring because it followed the Jane Austen Pride and Prejudice to closely, but it's well worth the read because the rest of the series proved to me to be very rewarding.If you are the kind of person who has read Pride and prejudice till it fell apart, and who's BBC (ala Colin Firth) Pride and Prejudice DVD set is scratched and now only plays the story, then this is just the series for you! Pamela Aiden has expanded on the Darcy we all know and love, not to mention trampled on the Caroline Bingley none of us can stand."
5,Very Pleased,I was skeptical to read this after reading a horrible fan fiction about what happened after Darcy and Elizabeth got married but the high ratings of this book pulled me in and I'm so glad they did! This book was truly delightful to read and contained all of the witty conversations between Darcy and Elizabeth from Austen's P&P. The exploration of Darcy's life was obviously very researched and thought over by Aidan to correctly portray him as living in high society Britain at that time. She also adds some great new characters like Darcy's valet Fletcher. Although Darcy appeared a little too obsessive to me sometimes the author molded her Darcy character and what happens to him very well in to the conversations he has with Elizabeth (that are rewritten from P&P) well enough that I didn't mind it. I loved this trilogy and recommend it to all P&P fans.
3,Entertaining,"Though this is by no means a great book, I did enjoy reading it. I enjoyed how the author fleshed out the relationship between Darcy and his cousin, Col. Fitzwilliam, and it's nice to meet some of his friends as well. Aiden spends a lot of time on the relationship between Darcy and his servants however. Okay, so he had servants, but if Aiden had truly been keeping with the tradition of P&P she would have relegated them to the background like Austen did. I admit to getting really tired of Darcy's valet ""Fletcher"" and his constant preening of Darcy. It seemed like all Darcy ever did was get dressed and undressed 24/7 - oh with tea in between of course. Oh well, I still enjoyed it."
5,Loved it!,"I absolutely LOVED this trilogy! I wasn't too worried about how similar it would be to Jane Austen, because obviously no one will probably ever come close to emulating her. Saying that, I thought all three books were very entertaining. The second one gets a bit boring, but it's worth it once you get to the third one.I would highly recommend this series to anyone who wants to see the other side of the coin."
4,A Fun Read,"I'm a huge Pride & Prejudice fan, and I'd like to believe I'm kind of discriminating about which sequels or prequels I find well-written. Despite what some of the others have said, I found this book enjoyable. It's very slow-moving, since it's only book 1 in a trilogy that covers the duration of P&P;, but I didn't find that a turn-off. It fills in all the little gaps involving Darcy and then some. For instance, maybe Jane Austen wrote that Elizabeth saw Darcy at some gathering the night before; Pamela Aiden goes into detail about exactly what took place there. Additionally, you get a thorough look into Darcy's life in London and Pemberley, including his relationship with Georgiana, which I thought Aiden did a great job portraying.Though the second book was definitely a filler, and my least favorite of the three (the third being the best), I'd still recommend them all to anyone who likes P&P; and enjoys a new perspective."
3,"An interesting read, but grammatically distracting","Aidan spins an interesting yarn, but the violence she does to English grammar (particularly with regard to the apostrophe) distracts from her story. She, her editor, and her publisher need to pay more attention to detail!"
2,Darcy reduced to a hormone ravenged teenager,I could not finish this book. I found it very boring and completely agree with other reviewers who say that the author turned Darcy into a teen-aged girl. They couldn't have said it better.
4,Dovetails Beautifully,"I think this book dovetails beautifully with Pride and Prejudice. I actually read it twice and referred to the original P & P for comparison. My only negatives are the use of the word ""electrify"" (page 90) which is out of place, as I don't think it fits with the time period, and there are some proofreading oversights. The character of Mr. Darcy, as created by Jane Austen, is broadened by Pamela Aiden in a manner so consistent with the original that it is almost seamless."
3,"OK, but where was the editor?","A fun attempt at exploring Darcy's character, but I was put off by the many typos and basic grammatical errors: misused apostrophes (""it's"" vs ""its""), spelling mistakes (""Hurst"" vs ""Hearst""), etc. Perhaps this book was self-published and the author did not have the benefit of a good proofreader. One is enough for me; I'll not engage in the rest of the trilogy."
5,Loved it.,I was so enchaned I stayed up all night reading. I can hardly wait for book 2 and book 3. Please hurry Ms Aiden!
2,Incredibly boring,"I managed to get halfway through the second book in this series before I just had to stop. Others have commented on the author's writing style, but this didn't bother me. She isn't Jane Austen and I was not expecting perfection, but the details! Oh my goodness, I just couldn't take it. Aidan feels the need to detail every inane thought or action of Darcy's and I just could not plow through the rest of the series. She concentrates on too many things that don't matter and I feel like the plot gets lost, I just couldn't stay interested. Perhaps if she could have shaved it down to one or two books I would have liked them more and finished the series but it was just too boring for me to deal with."
3,"Not bad, if you skip the parts created from scratch","*spoiler alert* Being a P&P addict, I enjoyed this book, until I came to the parts totally invented by the author, about the life of Mr Darcy in London after he and Mr Bingley's sisters ""escaped"" from Netherfield in order to prevent the marriage of Mr Bingley with Miss Jane Bennet. I found that parts utterly boring, with Mr Darcy being dressed and undressed like a mannequin by his servant, and attending assemblies into the high society of London. I decided to avoid buying the second book of the trilogy, which continues on the life of Darcy far from Elizabeth, and some day or other I will read the third one, but it's not a priority! Anyway, Aidan's style of writing is good."
3,"On the slow side, but worth reading","Although I enjoyed the beginnings of Darcy's side of the story in this book, I think it moved a bit slowly. Some chapters seemed dragged out, especially when Elizabeth wasn't present in the narrative. The scenes with them together are the most fun, since we see Austen's dialogue juxtaposed with Aiden's take on Darcy's mind. If this wasn't the story of Pride & Prejudice, I probably wouldn't have finished the series out, but I couldn't help continuing to find out what went through Darcy's mind in the rest of it. The third book absolutely makes it worth struggling through the first two."
4,Pride and Prejudice from Darcy's view,This is the first of three book retelling the Pride and Prejudice story from Darcy's perspective. This book and the third are very satisfying and use enough of the original conversations to keep the fan reading.
2,Abominable,"As a dedicated JA fan, and someone who has read ""Pride and Prejudice"" more than several times, I found this book boring and unconvincing. It offered no new insights, and I find myself even less interested in what the other two books in this series have to say. The author fails to capture the sparkling wit that makes Jane Austen's work so wonderful (and famous). Granted, Ms. Aidan is not Jane Austen, nor do I expect her to copy Austen, but this work felt brittle and dead. Where is the vibrancy? Where is the animation to compliment the style laid down in """"Pride and Prejudice""? Also, there were several typos (which always bother me). I wonder that this book was published at all. I have read much, much better fan fiction on the web. ""An Assembly Such as This"" isn't worth your time and money. If you really want to know what Mr. Darcy was thinking during the events of ""Pride and Prejudice"", you should imagine it yourself instead of adding Ms. Aidan's sterile interpretation to your bookshelf."
4,Not very Jane Austen but a great writer,"I started reading this book a day ago, haven't finished it. I read Pride and Prejudice so many times (ordered soundtrack, watch the DVD (old and new, series, etc.) and therefore I wouldn't have mistaken Pamela for Jane. Jane's choice of wordings are much more moving. However, the book is thus very good and I can hardly put it down to take a nap. It is very fun to read and I've just ordered book2 and book3 as well as ""Darcy's Diary""."
4,Mixed review,"This is the first Pride & Predjudice sequel I've read. Although I enjoyed reading the book I'm disappointed on 2 counts. First, the book is a teaser. You have to read all 3 (2 of which don't seem to be published yet) to get the whole story. Secondly, I find it hard to believe that a man really thinks the way this author has Mr. Darcy thinking. Perhaps a man should write a book of Mr Darcy's side of the story. The author has contributed some extra elements to the plot, but I'm not sure the servant's intrigues and the Christian view point are in keeping with Jane Austen's original. Too bad she didn't write a sequel herself."
1,Vapid and inane,"A total embarrassment to the author. Dull and poorly written. After forcing myself to get through the first 45 pages, I gave up. This book is perhaps faithful to the A&E movie---certainly not to the original Austen book. It has Bingley as OWNER of Netherfield (he is only renting it!) and ignores the fact that the BENNETS are the first family of the village; hence Caroline would have had to socialize with them whether she wanted to or not---certainly before accepting an invitation from Colonel Forster!! This is only the beginning of the ludicrous inaccuracies. The book is also dreadfully copy-edited; I found the same kinds of errors my high school students routinely make. Reviewers who raved about this just aren't very discriminating."
1,Plodding through Pride and Prejudice,"I enjoy Austen greatly, and have had some fun recently sampling spin-offs on Pride and Prejudice, so I looked forward to Aidan's book. Unfortunately, I had to force myself to finish this one...and if it hadn't been for my fondness for the original, I wouldn't have tried. This is of the ""I got up, brushed my teeth, washed my face, got dressed and went downstairs. I opened the refrigerator and took out the milk and juice...etc. etc."" school of writing. We are treated to nearly every thought that passes through Darcy's head, every casual conversation, etc. in an effort to build up his character. Overkill! Austen told a wonderful story in one short volume, but Ms. Aidan wants to drag out the same story for three volumes. I don't plan to read the second two."
1,Bad,"This book reads as bad Mary-sue fan-fiction. I barely made it past the first chapter and by the third I had just put it away. I have no interest in ever picking up this book again, I do not even care to know what the ending was.It was as some people say ""not my cup of tea"".I was looking for a more realistic and in character sequel type of book."
5,Great Read!,"After stumbling upon Elizabeth Aston's ""Mr. Darcy"" books, I was searching for some more ""Austenesque"" works, and saw this series recommended over Aston. Somewhat skeptical, I decided to buy only the first one in the series, and by the time I was half way through I was frantically ordering the last two on Amazon. I then spent the next five or so days haunting the mailbox (I'm too cheap to pay expedited shipping) so I could find out what in the world Darcy was going to do...In other words I LOVED this series, and I would absolutely recommend it. I kept telling my husband it was like Jane Austen was alive again and writing the other side of P&P. Just learn from my mistake and buy all three at the same time!"
4,A wonderful companion piece,"I enjoyed this peak into Darcy's mind. At times, I found myself thinking it was too over the top but the more I read the more I understood his behavior and his way of thinking. I would recommend this to any Pride and Prejudice fan."
5,Loved this Book!,"Out of all the Jane Austen continuation books that I have read, this was the best. Instead of taking characters out of Pride and Prejudice and creating a new story about them, this book tells Mr. Darcy's side of the story. We get a picture of what he was thinking about Elizabeth Bennett from his first sight. We get some insight as to why he felt it expedient to remove Mr. Bingley from Netherfield.This book stops at the removal of the Darcy/Bingley party from Netherfield. I cannot wait to delve into the next book. I usually speed read through books but for this one I made myself slow down and enjoy."
5,Most Excellent!!,"I found this book to be a most excellent parallel companion book to Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice. I feel that Ms. Aidan completely captured the Mr. Darcy whom we have all grown to dislike and love. In this book Mr. Darcy is quite beside himself with pride, arrogance and conceit towards the good country folks of Meryton, until he finds himself unwillingly attracted to Elizabeth Bennet. Elizabeth's lovely eyes captivate him even though he tries in vein to resist. As the story progresses, Elizabeth's vivacious, intellectual wit and boisterous personality unknowingly begins to hook Mr. Darcy and his resistance becomes futile. I read this book from cover to cover and was quite upset when I had finished. I wanted more and couldn't wait to get my hands on Ms. Aiden's next book ""Duty and Desire - Book 2."""
3,A basic movie song,"This is the love theme from Daylight. Why Daylight needed a love theme is beyond me. The words are very nice and the melody is very nice, as well. The problem is that this song is just too nice. Still, it is 100% better than the love theme from Titanic.The GREAT version of this song is the dance remix found on Dance Across The Universe, volume 1."
5,go fish,This book turned out to be a handy guide to one of the quietest corners of California where the fishing can't be beat. I took it with me when fishing season opened and the snow was just melting off the highest peaks. The book distilled out the lower elevation hikes which made choosing trailheads and streams very easy. I car camped near the ghost town of Bodie and followed their day hike suggestions around the base of Tioga Pass and Mono Lake. This is a one-of-a-kind book that's alot of fun to read with amusing insights and historical lore.
5,"Unconvential, and well rounded","We are a family of four and live at Lake Tahoe. For the past two years we've used this book for all sorts of outings. It has its own style and personality and sense of humor. The authors are local and go beyond just dryly listing trails. The maps and photos are just enough to whet the appetite and help you know what to expect. We also like it because most of the listings are reachable within two hours of our house. We're checking the hikes off one by one and now have completed a little over thirty, saving the Sonora Pass Yosemite areas for this summer. For local lore, fishing, kayaking, skiing and that extra spark that most authors aren't allowed to include, this book can't be beat."
4,"Excellent photos of Tibet, including Lhasa, Gyantse, Mount Kailash and the Guge Kingdom","An excellent coffee-table-type photographic account of Tibet. The cover is Tsaparang. There is a 22-page section on Mount Kailash, and a 24-page section on the Guge Kingdom and Tsaparang and Tholing. There is an introduction by His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama, another introduction by Robert Thurman, and brief overviews of each photographic area of Tibet in the book. There are some photos of Gyantse, Tingri, and Lhasa, among the other parts of Tibet."
2,Tea & Lack of Sympathy (or should that be vinegar?),"Cooley writes as though she lived the story and the emotions behind it. Although I get caught up thinking about the characters even when I'm not reading a book, I felt no sympathy for any of the characters in this book. I wanted to scream at Alice, ""Bad things happen - get over it and run as far from Madeline as you can."" Women were portrayed as neurotic and men as either weak or users. I know it was fiction but still...attention to detail was lacking. The Wizard of Oz debuted on TV in the late fifties, not 1949. The bits about the midnight drives and shared clothes were inconsistent from one mention to the next. A much better read is ""Was"" by Geoff Ryman which also explores the themes of home and family with a little Judy Garland thrown in. I was really glad when I finished reading ""Judy Garland, Ginger Love."""
1,"Judy Garland, Ginger Love","I think that the author is one of those ""Oh, I know everything about Judy Garland"" type of people. This woman knows no more than my five-year-old nephew does. I can rightly say this because I have read many articles and interviews with her children, Lorna and Liza, and I have had the pleasure of reading Lorna's book. Fifty percent of the information in ""Judy Garland, Ginger Love"" was incorrect and a slander to someone not around to defend herself. People should not read incorrect information not only because it would mislead them, but because it shows the author's ignorance."
2,"Judy Garland, Ginger Love-Remember, it's FICTION.","Nicole Cooley's book ""Judy Garland, Ginger Love"" does NOTHING for the memory of Judy Garland. More than anything else, it is a way to use Judy's name to sell a book. Material in this book regarding Judy Garland is so larded with error and misinformation that from an historic perspecive, it is useless, perpetuating the myths and half-truths that still surround this woman 30 years after her untimely death."
1,"I Agree--""WAS"" is a much better book!",I found this one a bit too wacked out for my taste--and agree with the reviewer who said it was inconsistent. It doesn't make sense a lot of the time.
5,Lush Electronica...,"If you have ever heard of Ulrich Schnauss and have bought one of his cds, then I suggest you get this one..it has a similar vibe, dreamy synth pads, lush strings, etc...This is one of my favorite cds of 2004. Favorite songs are:1. Gone-AMAZING!2. On A White Lake, Near a Green Mountain-so smooth......!3. Unrecorded-Synths with some distorted guitar(I think)..GREAT!4. In Church.Bascially most all the songs are pretty good to great...only one or two are weak in my opinion.Get this now, if you enjoy lush/melodic electronic music."
3,"Pleasant, but ultimately shallow.","This album was a disappointment for me. My first experience with M83 was a spectacular live show, and the recording just doesn't measure up. Obviously, the potential for greatness remains, but the performances are hollow and unsatisfying, and the mixing and mastering is downright bad.Don't get me wrong, it's a decent piece of work overall, and my high expectations may be making it out to be worse than it really is. It's definitely worth a listen, particularly if you've never heard M83 before, but make sure you've got enough in the piggy bank for the next time M83 comes to town."
3,Musical Snowstorm,"M83s chaotic and scratchy start soon blooms into hypnotic lyrics that suddenly end. The next track is somewhat hypnotic in its awakening and fuzzy and static in sleepy ways.Electronic voices seem to be exploring the landscape without any direction, wandering like lost souls across a newly found bliss. If you like white noise, this may intrigue you. It feels like you are walking through a snowstorm of sound on the first CD.The second CD seemed much more grounded and Tsuase was intriguing. Dead Cities, Red Seas & Lost Ghosts seems to be the creative high of the two albums and while there is a consistent humming, nature sounds explore the heights.~The Rebecca Review"
1,Boring Stuff,Why should you listen to this stuff when Kraftwerk already did the same thing 25 years ago? All the compositions are weak and very straightforward. They don't even on the same league with the mighty My Bloody Valentine who did it much much better with their legendary dense multi layered sounds.Save your $$$ and don't buy this garbage.
2,TV Fuzz,"This is about as deconstructed as you can get.It's like turning to a non-working channel on your television and listening to the fuzz, with a few bleeps, squeaks, low vocal samples, and scratches thrown in.If that sounds like something you'd like, by all means, pick this up.If not...You'll have two CDs FULL of random low-key noise."
1,Don't Believe The Hype,"This album is filled with pretentious, endlessly simple doodles. Anyone with Apple Garage Band and some very rudimentary musical ability would be able to churn it out in a weekend--and M83's reward for such effort is legions of people who will listen and say ""Far out..."". (sigh)"
5,it's a perfect day for shoegazing,"With a wealth of bands, mostly from obsecenely cold climates in places with hard to pronounce names, carrying the torch for Kevin Shield and the like (yes, there were others), M83 arrive with some slightly different tactics. There are hints of electronic twitterings, such as those we've grown to love thanks to artists such as Radiohead, Sigur Ros, and Mum. Then there also seems to be some sort of dialogue, though in a much more succinct manner than the likes of Godspeed You Black Emperor or Mogwai. So instead of only getting to hear part of your favorite track when you're in a rush for a shoegazing fix, you can listen to the whole song a few times. So if you've been longing for Slowdive to reappear (which I'm assured by Neil Halstead will never happen) and wearing out your Pale Saints tapes (yes, they really did come on tape), put an end to your disillusionment and pick up this cd. NOW!"
4,This makes a great gift,Sorry I cannot review this music. I purchased it as a gift for a woman that said she loved it.
5,My favorite book,"This was the first book I've ever read that I will read over and over again! The romance is increadoble, and it leaves you wanting more. Garwood's ""The wedding"" is the perfect sequel! I loved this book"
5,Typical Garwood...doesn't get old for me,"When I read a romance novel I want it to take me through many emotions, not just happy happy happy. Garwood takes me through the roller coaster ride but not enough. I loved her other books more than this, but I still can't bring myself to give it any less than 5! I highly recommend. It is a fast read."
5,Fantastic,I love Garwood and all her highlander books. Even her other books are great. I would suggest reading the highlander books in order though because some of these books hint at other characters from her other books and some even interact with each other. Garwood has neverdissapointed me yet. However she did start writing modern day romance and I never read those. I like historical romance more. I hope she goes back to it.
5,Wonderously funny and enlightening.,"Julie Garwood always seems to amaze me with the wonderful qualities of all her heroines. They always seem to have so many facets in their personalities, sense of humor, loveability and extremely down to earth. If only we should all be so lucky to find a love as pure and sincere as that love that is in all of Garwood's stories."
2,Lets You Down!,"Start out very good. Great humor. Half way through, it becomes very simple and silly. Very unrealistic for the times. So, first half you think you have a great book and then what a let down."
3,Okay but Could Have Been Better,"Let me start off by saying - I love Julie Garwood books, The Lyon's Lady is one of my all time favorites! I liked the Wedding and the Bride as well, but this book just didn't do a thing for me! It was so boring! And to tell us the secret and have the hero find out so soon! The book read a little too typical for my liking. If you like Garwood books, get it, but if you're looking for page after page of excitement - try another! I'm still going to get Ransom to see if the Ramsey and Brodick story turns out better."
2,Middle School romance...,"I feel like I have read this same story at least six times. Maiden falls for the EXTEMELY HUGE Scott. Big tough guy who turns out to be a big ol' Pooh Bear. Silly. The romance was the equivalent of a Medieval Middle School fling. Not even high school.Also no Scottish dialet to keep you in the setting, and the language was way too modern.There was very little background story about the H.Just not my cup of tea."
4,Enjoyable read.,One of those books that I found hard to put down. The story flowed easily and I was sorry to find I was at the end.
3,Not bad at all,"I usually read something other than romance, but I decided to read this as a break from heavy fiction.The beginning ""resistance"" phase between Judith and Iain was exciting. Also, when Judith helped others in the town, made friends, and changed things for the better, it was heartwarming.However, I felt that one of the ""secrets,"" when revealed, could have created more of a dramatic rift between the two characters. As it was, the setback seemed minor, and I never feared that they would not be reconciled.The bottom line was that this was a fun read, but I did not leave with very deep or enduring feelings about the characters."
1,Quickest read for me ever!,"This was my first Julie Garwood book and maybe not fair to read after The Outlander series but I felt it was a story for a younger audience. The main characters calling each other ""husband"" and ""wife"" was a bit silly. Many of the characters seemed so immature, one wanting to leave her husband because he ""yelled"" at her. I did read it in a day so the fact that I finished it deems a 1 star but overall a silly book."
4,The Secret's worth keeping,"This book was a nice twist on the love/hate English & Scott relationships that had some pretty good suspense, romance, and a happy ending. The only thing I found a little different was the strange/odd personalities of all the Scott's in this particular clan. It became annoying at a point, but who knows.......I'm not a history expert so maybe this is true to character for some of the clans.Overall it was a good read with a masculine but cold clan laird who warms to an English beauty with an identity secret that don't realize her worth. She comes from England to Scottland to fulfill a childhood promise to a lass she befriends at the festivals held on the border. I again enjoyed the uncharacteristically strong female, Judith, in the story who defies age-old rules and regulations to be who she wants to be......you go girl!"
3,Okay,"I read ""The Bride"" before I read ""The Secret"", and I was disappointed. I really liked ""the Bride"" and expected much of the same from the Secret. It just wasn't there."
4,The Secret,This is a wonderful book!! I enjoy reading it again and again. I actually had the book in paperback and enjoyed it so much I repurchased it so that I could read it anytime.
4,A Romance That Changes A Laird And His Clan Forever!!!!!,"Judith & Frances Catherine became friends as children. They didn't know at the time that they were supposed to be enemies. They kept in touch thru-out their childhood and even after Frances Catherine married and moved to the north Highlands. Frances Catherine was scared that she would not survive childbirth as both her mother and her grandmother had died in childbirth. Judith had promised her friend that she would be there for her when Frances Catherine delivered her 1st child. Fulfilling this promise sets off a series of events that will bespell a clan Laird and change a clan forever. I loved this story... and have already started reading the 2nd in this series, Ransom."
5,Janet,Julie Garwood never disappoints. Her blend of humorous encounters and sizzling attractions promotes lifting of gloom on even the rainiest of days. :)
4,"Pictures, Pictures and more Pictures","Sing Blue Silver is an awesome Duran Duran book that captures photos from their first major US world tour which was sponsored by Coca-Cola. This book is a great companion piece to the Sing Blue Silver DVD. The book doesn't have many words, it's basically pictures of various sizes in color and black and white. If you want to check out some pics of the group from back in the day, then Sing Blue Silver is a book that you should check out."
1,Dissapointing,"When I bought this CD I expected it to be Malmsteen's version of these classics, but then when I got it I realized that it was just a compilation of classical music.Anyway, if you like Symphonic metal or Malmsteen, it is good to have this compilation."
4,A good book but for specialist,"The book provides a lot of material but it left me the impression of a core material hidden in ""a bit too many"" technicalities, being the textbook more likely suitable as a reference for a specialist (I am not) than for a reader interested in the subject. I really appreciated the chapter ""Fractal Functions and Wavelets"", a good description of links beetween wavelets and fractals."
3,Not Quite what I was hoping for...,"Well, I bought this book from a book store, because I thought it look like it had good info even though it was small. Leter, I regretted not reading betweeen the lines. I was appalled by the negative veiw point of chinchillas by the author. She explained that they had a tendency to be neurotic, and untamed. She ealso explained that 'if your planning on breding for a profit, think again. There are far too many chinchillas already, and you will probably end up giving them away.' I bought his book when it was fairly new, and now, almost a year later, I have two wonderful chinchillas, and my girl, phoebe is pregnant, and I already have five people lined up that would like to purchase a baby. I'm afraid I'll have to dissapoint a few by telling them to wait until the next littter! Of course, it may have a certain effect on 'us Americans'(laugh) because the author is German and it was published there first."
2,Booty book for Jacqui's photos...,"We bought Booty Food after reading the reviews raving about the book posted on Amazon.com and because we used to enjoy Jacqui Malouf's show Hot off the Grill with Bobby Flay on Food Network Channel. However, we are extremely disappointed with the contents of Booty Food. The book is full of photos of Jacqui Malouf specifically choreographed for this book and the recipes are nothing to write home about. We had such high hopes for this book, but they all faded away after trying few recipes in the book. If you really want a cookbook for special occasions to give your girlfriend or wife, buy instead Intercourses: An Aphrodisiac Cookbook by Martha Hopkins and Randall Lockridge. But if you find Ms. Malouf attractive and want a book of her photos with her significant other then buy this book. I guess our standards for good food are much higher than other reviewers'."
2,Fast delivery but not a good buckle,"The delivery was very fast but, I hadn't been using the belt for long when the buckle fell off, it fell off after 2 hours of usage, the first time I tried it on:(A very beautiful belt so I'm bummed out..RED SEXY ULTRA SOFT SQUARE BUCKLE WIDE SASH CINCH BELT"
1,Junk,"You can never have enough wide belts, as there are so many outfits you can make with them. This one, however, fell apart the first time I tried to put it on and I threw it away."
4,Palmieri Boogaloo!!!,"Great album from the days of good salsa music. Here you have Cheo Feliciano (of Joe Cuba Sexttet fame) and Ismael Quintana sharing the vocal duties, while Eddie & Co. blow the house down.A couple of boogaloos (Ay Que Rico, Cinturita, Palo de Mango), with some guaguanco (Busca Lo Tuyo and Yo No Engaño A Las Nenas) and a throw-away twist (African Twist).This one also has a really cool cover. Get it for the boogaloo and guaguanco, skip the twist. You will really dig it!!"
4,Better than nothing,"Not a substitute for old fashion water and soap, but it will let you feeling fresh - at least for a while."
3,"Not great value, but good at what it does","This product is a little pricey for just 8 sheets. It's very thick and great for what it does, but I wouldn't buy it again."
2,Really not worth the the money...,"I have been a big fan of the Unofficial Guide to Disney World for several years now. I have purchased one yearly for the past twelve years. We recently decided to purchase the Companion book to the Unofficial Guide to WDW, believing it would provide some interesting background Information. Instead we were basically given a book of pretty much useless drivel. It's really hard to see where she even likes or enjoys WDW. The author completely lambasted the Hall of presidents; going off on some bizarre 'white guilt' rant (after a bit of looking around it turns out she was a former Washington Post reporter, which explains quite a bit). The entire book is more or less a weird overview of the 'World' through eyes of a liberal elitist. If that's your thing, enjoy. Otherwise, don't waste your time or money."
2,This could have been a good book,"This book has a good deal of information and some very interesting stories, but Zibart's writing style leaves a lot to be desired. I found myself rereading some paragraphs four or five times and still I had no idea what she was trying to say. Does the publisher not employ editors?"
2,Not what I expected,"After reading the many reviews here, I purchased this CD with the impression it would be similar to Particle. However, New Deal does not come close to the energy that I have found on Particle and other similar albums. Their mix of instruments is predictable and at times monotonous. It's hard for me to really get into this CD and find the groove where the music carries me. Perhaps they should add some vocals as something is missing."
4,One of my favorite bands.....,"I saw these guys a couple of years ago in Portland, Maine. I never even heard of them until we went to the club they were playing at. Well, long story short, these guys blew me away. Really incredible stuff. The fact that they put out so much sound with only three guys on stage was amazing.Their website hasn't been updated in a while, so I can only hope they're still together (I would love to see them live again). To be honest, although this CD has better sonics then their live discs, I would get the live stuff first. On the live discs, if you didn't hear the crowd you wouldn't believe it actually was live. If I remember correctly, their live performances were recorded on Mini-Disc, so the sound isn't as full as this CD. Doesn't matter. The live stuff is the best. Start there and get this one last. Not that this is bad."
2,Cheap compilation under the title of original LP,"In 1974.Ike and Tina Turner recorded their last great LP titled ""Nutbush City Limits"",based around Tina's fictional childhood memories and graced with beautiful art cover.This CD is shameless compilation of their work from different years,LP's and sources - nothing close to original LP,the only thing they have in common is the title."
4,Nice addition to my grill tools,"I could survive without it but it does do a nice job of hooking into my slab of roast beef and flipping it over, making the most minimal puncture in the meat, keeping the juices in. Just don't wave it around anyone. Very pointy sharp edge. No animals were harmed in the making of this review."
5,The perfect grilling tool,"You would think that here in Florida you would be able to find a Meat Hook at any stores that sell grilling equipment. Unfortunately, with most larger stores headquartered in the North, most buyers do not even know the difference between barbecue and grilling. Once again Amazon was a lifesaver for me by stocking not one, but three or four different choices of meat hooks when I ordered mine. Seriously, how else would a serious griller turn a steak or various kinds of chops without looking like a rank amateur?"
1,All the juice drains out when you use this thing,"it's well made but every time you hook the meat the juices run out. Why on earth would you want that? Use tongs so the juices stay sealed in, not this thing. it works, it moves the meat, but the resulting loss of juice isn't worth it. TONGS...get TONGS and use them. I used this twice and going to toss it."
4,barbecue meat hook,"The only complaint I have about this product is that if you use it while camping, over an open fire it is too short."
2,Not enough meat,"I like the concept of this book and I have no problem with its selections. However, I find that there isn't very much said about each of these business books. While historical context is provided for each, there is little that gives me a new perpective on things or provides me with something that I can apply. It is like viewing historical documents in a museum without there being a description of why they're relevant or how they impact the present day. I prefer the more vibrant discussion found in ""The Guru Guide."""
4,Good summaries and reading list,"Wow, do I have a lot of reading to do now..This book did a great job of really reaching out to some management classics and I am excited to start tackling this reading list. Although many selections seem quite ""dated"", truths know no age. Before I hand this book a 5 start rating I would like to know if the books are really that great and that only happens when the list falls. In summary, if you are looking for management books gold, this is a great place to start."
2,"Great information, very poorly conveyed","I agree with earlier reviewers that the book is hard to follow and does not have a coherent line of delivery of the material. Nonetheless, the content is excellent, with many valuable insights and information. My impression is that the author has great expertise in the material but was either rushed or careless in the writing of the book."
2,Caution...,"I found this book very difficult to follow. There are far too many mathematical derivations, and little explanation about what the equations derived are useful for. It is an extremely specialist book and not really for general reading. A lot of material is presented, but it is poorly described."
5,Funky Spunky Girlz Called Pixel Chix,These Pixel Chix are off da hook! I love them!! They are totally awesome fun! I think they should make Pixel Guys!THE END!
2,Not a great toy,"The pixel chix girl is annoying. She always needs somthing to do. You can't just let her sit there and if you do she leaves. It's not worth 30 dollars, trust me. So don't waste your money."
4,what I think about pixel chix...,"pixel chix are so cool,yet,the batteries run out really fast so I recomend to buy 2 rechargeable battery kits,the packaging says there are only 3 types of houses,yet there are 2 colours for each pixel chix house,the common one,and the special edition colour one,the colours for the houses are the following,Miami loft=light pink/common Miami loft=Aqua green/special edition colourContry cottage=yellow/common Contry cottage=fusha/special edition colourBeverley hills house=blue/common Beverley hills house=purple/special edition colour(If you see a special edition colour house, buy it for you daughter emeadiately because they are really hard to find)after you get one you get up to level 5 but over time you slowly lose interest in this absoloutly fabulous toy"
1,broken,my husband got my daughter and myself pixel chicks for xmas.I replaced the batteries in hers 3 times within a week and half and finally brought it back for an exchange. We went to play them and now mine is dead. Tried to replace the batteries and reset but nothing works. She really likes this toy but we are having the worst luck with them.
3,Parent disappointment,I think this toy is a waste. The instructions are not too clear and the toy is TOOOOOOOOOOO LOUD. Now they came out with the car and that is a waste TOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!! In order to connect to the house the child has to play with the car for about a week in order to earn points to move to the house. Those instructions give no mention of that. I only found out because I called Matel.The house is too much money to spend on such a tiny toy!!!!!
1,This sux,"Trust me, I bought this game hoping it would be entertaining and fun but I was wrong. You accumulate things way too fast and if you don't play with it for a couple days she gets upset(you'll have cobwebs in the house and will lose your things). I believe this has got to be the most BORINGEST game in the world. *yawn*"
5,eveyone,if you get a pixel chix car hook it with a pixel chix house and the girl will go into the house from the car or into the car from the house
1,i hate it!!!!!!!!,"this is the worst toy i have ever got. i absolutely hate these. If i were to ever get another, i would rather die. My mom gave it to me as a i hate you present. I hate these!!!! i hate it sooo much!!!1"
1,Not good bad .......... DREAM life is better,this game was baughten for my daughter. She liked it for about an hour after that she beat the whole game. Its very boring. Dream life is better more selections. Its 30.00 dollars to a waste of money dont get it
1,I HATE THIS TOY!,"This toy i can describe in only two words: boring and horrible! This is the worst toy, and you can never shut it up. You can't take off the volume, and it is escpescially bad for little kids, because it is a spoiled brat."
1,Can someone please tell me...,"...just what is ""Miami"" about this? Way too tacky even for Miami. More likely Palm Springs, or *somewhere* in So. Cal. In your dreams Pixel Chix."
3,A lot of money to spend on a toy whose fun only lasts for about 12 hours,"My daughter played lots with this at first, then when she got through all the levels, she was done with it. Done. She played with it no more. That's a lot of money to spend on a toy that only lasts for about 12 hours."
5,pixel chix 5 stars,My daughter who is [...] of age and I love this toy. We both look forward to see what these 2-d girls are gonna do next. right now we have the pink and blue houses. Our next will be the cars. Even after she's finished all of the levels she stills plays with them. This is one toy that will get good use out of. I hope they make more homes since you can connect 10 house together.
3,Great Idea but too many problems,"My 6 year old got this for Christmas and she loves it - or I should say loved it. So much that when the screen went black and the Pixel Chick died suddenly, it caused a great deal of upset and tears. I returned it to the store and exchanged for another one. I checked it out in the store but by the time I got back to the car, this one had the fatal black screen sickness too! I was very disappointed and sad for my little girl who loved her Pixel Chick so dearly. This is a great toy and a fabulous idea for the younger set but with so many problems it makes me wonder if they released it too quickly without working out the glitches."
4,"Good book, but Kelby's other ones are better.","Compared to Down & Dirty Tricks for Photoshop 6, and the newer Down & Dirty Tricks for Photoshop 7, I didn't find Killer Tips as good or as much fun. This may be an unfair statement as I got the D&D6 book at the same time and may have suffered from information overload. But these three books should be part of all Photoshop user libraries."
3,Filler tips not Killer,"Some of the tips are 'Killer', the rest are just 'Filler'. Sad, because Kelby/Nelson kept repeating some of the same tips in a different way. On the other hand, its well written & not boring with only one mistake that I could find, which was the 'Undocumented shortcut' to bring the fill dialog box up and instead it was the shortcut to lock transparent pixels/fill, but later-on he does give the right shortcut. I apparently knew most of the 'Killer Tips' already. If you don't know that the bracket keys [ ] increase/decrease your brush size, then this book will be very useful. But don't expect to be godly enlightened, because there is actually a tip in this book that says to use 'image > image size' to make your files smaller or larger in size, ah this reminds me of when he said, 'We wrote it to get free drugs', in the introduction. I don't think he was kidding! ;)"
2,Not the best pet home.,"The hampsters learned to open the door pretty quickly. We have to put a twist tie on it so they can't escape. The wheel being on top seemed like a good idea but when they poop and pee in it (not to mention hoard all their food in it) and then run, the contents of the wheel get sprayed all over everything around the cage about 2 feet around. Ugh. The tubes are difficult to get on and off if you buy the extra tunnels to add-on. They also don't fit the holes in some instances. If you want to remove the wheel, nothing else will fit in that hole so it's pretty impossible to replace the wheel."
1,Do NOT buy this - a hazard to your pet,Our hamster learned to open the cage the second day. She got out and fell into a sump pump and died. Do NOT buy this.
2,Not as cool as it looks,"I bought this cage thinking it would be fun for the hamster with all the cool spaces and compartments. It was fun until she decided to make her nest in the wheel AND still run in it. So not only is it a mess from all the bits of bedding, food and urine that get out through vented holes in the wheel, she also makes a racket when she runs in there with all the food and bedding at night."
2,"Great, except for that wheel.","I have owned Critter Trail products before, with previous pets. They have always been wonderful. They are easy to assemble, easy to clean, and give enough space and things to do for the hamsters. This time, I got a dwarf hamster, so I went with a smaller model. The X comes in cool colors, still easy to disassemble and reassemble, plenty of space, plenty to do. But like other reviewers mention, that wheel isn't the best planning. The wheel is vented, naturally, so everything that occurs in there (eating, peeing, pooping) is let loose on the top of the cage and the surroundings. In previous Critter Trails, my hamsters have always made the ""petting zone"" their bed. But I suppose the wheel is more comfortable, and that's where my hamster eats, sleeps, and pees. I imagine he only comes down for water. It makes a horrible mess."
1,TOO HIGH,I agree with the other reviewer. I can buy them for $2.48 at Walmart. The only problem is they don't carry very many in stock. I love the sugar free wafer cookies Voortman makes - they are really good. This company needs to lower the price and not try to take advantage of people!!
2,too complex for beginners,"I'm new to scrapbooking so got this book for ideas. There were few interesting ideas but...1) Required too many tools and supplies that I didn't have (I already have several hundred $s worth of tool and supplies).2) Too many steps! The design process seemed too complex. It seemed like it'd take me an hour just to get the first 5 steps done, let alone the remaing 15 steps.3) The designs weren't to my taste. I thought lot of the designs seem to ""folksy"" or too busy looking. I prefer more clean and ""modern"" look.Overall, I found the book to be more discouraging to a new scrapbooker like me than inspiring."
3,Not For Everyone,"I like scrapbooking but am not interested in this book. I bought based on the descriptions and reviews. Very disappointed in that most of the pages, if not all, have something too thick on them. I like my pages to lay flat and not bulk up my albums. Cute ideas for framing or displays... but a lot of the best parts don't lay flat enough for me and my scrapbook albums. Lots of techniques are shown, but many are also too time-consuming or too involved or, as other said, require too many different materials/tools (thus cost too much) for me. I want cute and quick. Precious yet balanced with my time and effort."
5,Love this Book,"I have been scrapbooking for several years and found this book to be a breath of fresh air for me. I love borders, but never seem to come up with enough ideas on my own to make them look truly creative. Some of the ideas in this book are quite time consuming others,simple and fairly quick. I like using both depending on how much time I have to scrap,how creative I am feeling or how special the pictures I am using are. I have really enjoyed using this book for layouts with my Grandchildren. I would definitely recomend this book to those who love borders!"
2,Disappointed,"I was hoping this book had more pizzazz to it, but was disappointed in the majority of the boarders. The instructions and the templates were very well written, but not a book for the beginner for certain. I just thought the book was dull."
2,For Future Use,"I am not yet qualified to review this book. I scanned it, was somewhat pleased with the content and put it up on my bookshelf to be used in the future."
5,An East Coast experience moves west,"I was introduced to Green Goddess dressing while living in the eastern part of the US. It's a great taste, but since living in the West, it has been inaccessible. Until I discovered it on Amazon. Do yourself a favor and give it a try! And if you don't like it, you can always send me your leftovers. :-)"
1,never order from this company,I ordered this game thinking i was getting a good deal when i installed the game it only contained the menu screen when i clicked on the game itself it only loaded a black screen and froze my pc. when i got ahold of the company they tried to tell me my pc couldnt handle the game however i tried to install it on both of my laptops one is a brand new hp running windows 7 and the other is a bit older running windows xp both have the minimum requirements to run the game and i got the same result in both pcs. this company doesnt stand by their products and i will never purchase anything from them again.
4,Great classic,"This game keeps me entertained for hours years ago. I recently found the disc and tried to install it on my newer laptop. Unfortunately, it hasn't been revamped to work with Vista, and an attempted installation yielded very pixelated graphics. :(If you have XP, get this game! It is very cheap, and just as fun as the newer, similar games."
1,Doesn't work,It's a very cheap remake by sold out and even in compatibility mode across almost every OS will not run for me.
3,Its OK,Joan makes some interesting comments about people in the dance world but not enough. I enjoyed learningher perspective on the difference in training and dance techniques among the dance companies.
3,Not good for replacement!,"This seems to be a good lock, pretty solid, but if you want to replace your existing the most popular in NYC cheap jimmy proof lock it won't work for you. There is a difference in mounting holes about 1/8 of an inch. So you won't be able to screw it into existing holes either you can't drill a new holes that close. For your reference the distance between vertical holes 2-1/8 and 1-15/16 by horizontal. I think that Yale is not so popular to setup his own holes pattern and should comply the size with the dominant locks on the market, even with no name brands, just because those cheap locks installed in the most NYC apartments. Also the pictured color is gray, but I have received bronze."
5,"WONDERFUL, HIGHLY ANOINTED, CD",I really enjoyed this CD from track 1 to the very end. I have heard great things from their minsitry as well! The CD took me from high praise to pure worship to the Holy Ghost club!! It is a must buy!!!! I can say more but I dont have time!! Simply WONDERFUL!!!
3,Not Enough for your Money,I was very impressed with the concept of this gift because I know a few movie lover's so it caught my eye. But I was NOT impressed (let's even say very disappointed) with the quantity of product for the heavy price. in conclusion - price vs quantity did not add up. I would not recommend spending your money...you could put a nicer box together yourself for about half the price - ordering thru this vendor is just convenience.
5,I Want To Be A Chick!!!,"I can't express just how excited my girlfriends and I were to read this book. It is like a step-by-step process of how to set up a club, and appears to leave nothing out! All 8 of us have bought one and read it, and cannot wait to get started! Once I picked it up, I couldn't put it down. I went to a book signing by one of the Chicks, and appreciated their honesty about not being ""experts."" More than anything, they have given my friends and I (ages 37 to 62) the courage to just do it! I strongly encourage anyone even considering getting started in a club to get this book. It sets the framework and makes it easy and FUN!"
1,Clean out the Coop == This Book STINKS!!,"Investment clubs are great. This book, however, is a stinker.Why listen to a bunch of strangers complain and yack about their lives? It sure won't help your financial returns.Get some better and free advice from the organizations that show people how to start and manage a succcessful investment club (The National Association of Investment Clubs is one). That's what the Beardstown Ladies did and that's what my friends and I did. Our investment returns have consistently outperformed these pampered==actually spoiled==chicks. Why make them rich when the money would be better spent on your own investments?"
3,Great for Beginners,"This book is written in a coffee klatch style, with great ideas and simple explanations. While there is a lot more chatting than content, it keeps the book from being dry and boring. And the content IS good, especially for those who are starting at the very beginning and need the basics explained. I recommend that you read the excerpts to see if her style is okay for you. If so then buy the book!"
1,Save your money . Go to the Motley Fool site,"There is nothing new here that the Motley Fool doesn't offer for free. While the author attempts to appear as a free-thinking , independent women, every time her name is mentioned it is followed by ""wife of a hockey player"". While her stories are upbeat, her stock choices are downgraded. As a longtime investor, i find some of her advice lacking. Its P/E shows that this book is overpriced."
1,Their INvestment Secret : Marry Money,"It's easy to make a small fortune in the market when you invested a few years ago and used money that your wealthy husbands gave you to play with.The more honorable among us, who make our money the old-fashioned way, by earning it, will find this book shoddily written, carelessly researched and extremely superficial.Investment clubs can give you the basics. There, I said it, so you don't need to waste your money on this ridiculous piece of nonsense. Stick with real advice from people who earned their money through good portfolios not those who married wealthy men.They may like to call themselves chicks but that's too polite for their tactics."
1,Would fly away if it was any more superficial,"The title is cute, though somewhat insulting to women. But my quarrel is with the substance, or should I say the lack of substance, in this fluff.Would a man ever buy a book with such a shallow and sexist title? No way. And for good reason. Men know that books that talk down to readers are never a good investment but only a marketing strategy. Don't fall for it.Women still earn less than men and following this poorly written and superficial advice is only going to make the wealth gap between women and men even larger.Women can do as well, if not better than men, at investing. But not with books like this pitiful one."
1,Lots of Clucking But To No Purpose,"They yack and yack and yack but there's no point to their pointless chats. Geez, you can get this kind of shallow talk at the local beauty parlor. If you want investing advice you should turn to a book by someone with true investing expertise, such as Peter Lynch or Burt Malkiel. These women are just selling you a snow job and lining their own pockets at our expense.Most of the advice is already out of date and the book has been out less than a month. Should be called ""Chicks Laying An Expensive Joke On An Unsuspecting Public"""
5,FUN READING WHILE LEARNING TO INVEST!!,"I NEVER thought I would be interested in the Market, then a friend contacted me about starting a club. Our start was this fun and exciting book, it was SO easy to follow and understand and I just couldn't put it down. When you are starting out with no knowledge of where to start, they help you to really understand while getting a chuckle too. I WANT to know where our money is going (while reading our statements each time) and make MORE money while I'm doing it. I recommed this book if you want to have fun and learn at the same time. :) GO CHICKS!"
2,A Stereotype at Any Latitude Smells the Same,"Christians are all anti-Semitic, boys are all violent, girls are all kind, [insert monodimensional thought here], blah blah blah. Two stars instead of one because it is set in Canada rather than the Midwest which is about the only deviation from the stereotypical formula."
3,Nice album but not the right color as shown,"This album really is adorable and its a good quality. The product is how described and is a good buy. The only complaint I have is that in the photos, the left side of the cover looks to be pink in color. The pink and green is what led me to purchase the album. But I was disappointed when I opened the box to see that the pink isnt really pink but rather peach. I was totally bummed and unfortunately will be sending back as I was looking for the pink and green theme, not peach and green."
5,great book-fiercly independent,"'leo@fergusrules.com' is one of those rare books that should have more teenagers reading on their own without having to rely on television as their means of entertainment. Leonora; a filopino-italian-american teenager lives with her grandmother in Manila, where she spends all of her free time out of school on a computer-gaming network called 'Apeiron' A friend from school, Bri, is lost on the network and it is up to Leonora (accompanied by an obese monk) to save him. They meet odd encounters on the way, and if you were ever an awkward teenager (or are now) you've probably had dreams similar to this."
2,Lewis Carroll may rest in peace,"I hated this book and give it two stars only because I actually finished it in hopes of gaining some reflective and introspective insight which seemed so evasive during the actual reading. Sadly, none such occurred. To compare this novella with the likes of Lewis Carroll is beyond insult. Mr. Carroll's Alice wanders aimlessly through a dreamland while addressing political, social and philosophical quandries. Tangherlini's Leo is a pinball bouncing aimlessly around as she erratically runs into various buzzers and bells only to quietly disappear between the flippers at the end of a too long and low scoring game. Imature and tideous and with the excitement of a comicbook without pictures, I wish I could get my money back."
2,Not So Fast,"As a retired LA cop, I can tell you that Hawley lacks street experience. However, his book is entertaining, and the story is told in the typical crime story fashion most people are accustomed to. With his second book out, I am wondering how Hawley has the time to be a sheriff? Of course, I have been hardened by the streets of LA."
5,A Must Read,"This book was very interesting to me. The stories it tells reveal a lot about the way people are still treated in America. I believe that Dr. Barnes would want people to change their minds and eliminate prejudices. However, I agree with her that we must address the problem of how people act. The way that people act is what hurts others. We have seen many instances of legal means changing the majority of people's actions. This has indeed helped minorities tremendously. Whether or not a person has hatred in their heart, you cannot tell. No one is a mind reader. However, you can easily tell and become hurt when an act is committed against you. The first step is definitely curtailing behavior. Along with that, of course, we hope that people's minds change as well.I recommend this book because so many people who are in the majority are not even aware that minorities suffer so many slights and in so many ways. This book is definitely an eye-opener that I believe whites should read."
1,Not useful,"Definitely there is still racism. And definitely every American should continue to be informed it still exists. But this book, as evidenced by many reviewers, simply incites emotions of solidarity between certain population groups instead of teaching, explaining, and attempting to solve the problem. I believe Ms. Barnes' book hurts, not helps, our common goal."
1,more harm than good,"I picked up this book excited to use it in a class on race, but immediately put it down. I'm afraid this book could do more harm than good. There is no analysis that helps frame these personal accounts. The understandings of race and racism ignore much of the progress social scientists have made in figuring out what these terms mean and how they function. Very simplistic, and very misleading. I feel this could increase misunderstandings she is trying to lessen. The distance between those she writes about (people who consciously experience a raced reality) and the targeted audience of her book (whites who do not recognize the role race plays in others' lives) may be increased by this text."
5,Racism Is Real But Can Be Eliminated,"One can easily find books on racism, but not a book like Everyday Racism. Dr. Barnes has taken writing about racism to a new plane. In this book, we actually experience racism in its many forms that blacks are subjected to every day and in every walk of life. Dr. Barnes tells both blacks and whites how to end racism, which will not only give adult blacks and whites better mental health and happier lives, but will give little black children and little white children better growing up environments, better mental health, and happier lives as children and adults. Hate, dislike, avoidance, etc. are adverse to one's mental and physical health, and happiness.While there is racism against races other than blacks, this book focuses on racism against blacks by whites. However, I think the solutions presented by Dr. Barnes are applicable to racism against all ethnic groups."
1,a waste of time,"We all want to get rid of racism, and for those of us who are black, the problem is of particular interest. The trouble with this book is that the author, like so many in our black community, figures that an appeal to white America to just ""stop being racist"" is sufficient. It is not. We need to stop acting like victims and start acting like competent human beings. We need to stop engaging in criminal behavior, get a job, go to school, speak proper English, and so on. Read John McWhorter instead of this tripe. Or, if you would prefer to sit around and bemoan your fate, read this book, I suppose."
1,A very bad author...,"The author needs some serious help. I am surprised so many readers have reviewed this book positively. The stories told are so minute, so pointless, it takes away from real racist acts that really do occur everyday. In fact, most of the stories are from people's pasts, 20, 30 or more years ago. That was yesterday, let's work on tomorrow.The author, Annie Barnes, is anything but an intellectual. She offers no useful answers to stop racism, even intimating that racism is okay as long as people don't act out on their hateful beliefs.Please don't support this book, try something like Race, Crime, and the Law by Randall Kennedy, a well respected black author who really has something to say."
1,"Very , very , very behind","After reading this book, and finishing it I noticed a them when it came to barnes' perception of america's racism. It is the same tired and know completely false image that ""'bl**ky''s always the victim,'wh**ey''s always the culprit"". Even I , a black american 21-year-old, know this is not true. Rascims comes from all derections. Not once did Barnes mention any examples that included the following:Racism among non-white groups.Intra-racism (common among the black popluation)Racism against biracial or multiracial people.racism AGAINST whites BY blacks.If there's one major mistake made with this book it was giving it the mistitle ""Everyday Racism,a book for all Americans"" beacause it isn't , and it's not."
1,please!!!,"Not only can I not recommend this book, I actually have an extremely negative reaction towards the book. The author, a black female (who is a professor but not a researcher or scholar) actually says thinking racist thoughts is okay as long as one does not act on these thoughts! This is obviously not the way to solve any long term problems.There are also several grammatical errors in the first several pages..."
5,HOME SWEET HOME!!,"If you ever get homesick for pow wows, 49'ers, and GREAT songs - Then you have to get this one to add to the collection. Black Lodge Singers do it again!! Good combination of many greats you've heard around. Rock On! Bring it with you on the highway and your drive will definitely be a BETTER experience.Hoka Hey!! Mitakuye Oyasin"
3,Not Very Scary,"To say this is the best Halloween film in 30 years might be the truth since there aren't many movies about Halloween itself that are any good. With that said, Trick r Treat is a decent movie and nicely filmed. The movies problem is that it is not very scary. If you stripped away the sexual content from the film and a few blood scenes like a severed head, it could be a TV movie for a younger audience. I expected better from this since there was a lot of talk about it, but I was disappointed. Fifteen year old girls might scream at the lame and predictable hooks the film deleivers, but veterans of horror movies like me will be let down. Tom C."
3,A HALLOWEEN TREAT,If you want something entertaining and scary then this is pretty good saw it last year for halloween we loved it escpecially the ending
3,GOOD MOVIE,"I thgought this movie was really good considering it wasn't released in the movies. the idea was great, good job."
2,Hello? This is far from a classic!,"I was expecting so much after hearing al the news about this film. I was really let down. It was different and unique in its own way. However, it was not that remomorable for me. It had a great feel to it, I mean color/camera work, however, the stories were just not that interesting to me. In many ways it felt like an 80's horro film, so I should have liked it. Let me just say this, I recently watched ""The Gate"" agaain after several years. After watching this film I had that same feeling. Sort of like, okay, but.....where is the punchline.."
1,Awful,"Horrible acting, bad plot and no Bruce Campbell. Here are some more words to describe this film: awful, boring, lame, and dull."
2,Just Another Straight To DVD Movie Dressed Up As A Cinema One,"Don't waste your time or money on this load of old cods wallop, it plays out like a straight to dvd film and although the stories do intermix with each other they border on tedious to down right stupid. They should have called this film Happy Thanksgiving because it is a real turkey. Don't get me wrong, when I first saw the trailer to this before it was released I was excited and wanted to like this movie. After watching it once I thought, in the words of Mad Magazine, Yeeech what a let down.The only bright spark in this whole fiasco is the last story but that is too little too late, so if you see this in the $2 bin by all means grab it but don't pay any more for it, as it's just not worth it."
3,"Pretty good, but the hype spoiled it for me","Thanks to all the online hype surrounding this film, I expected to be totally blown away by it. I expected it to be as thrilling as all the great Halloween horror classics, including Carpenter's Halloween and Hitchcock's Psycho. I expected so much more from this -- but didn't get it. Trick 'r Treat was decent as far as horror films go, and it had its good moments. But parts of it were a disappointment: The vampire scene was TOO campy; other characters were TOO silly to work with the dark humor that was attempted. Had I not been so pumped up about this ahead of time, I wouldn't have been as underwhelmed. Before I saw the film, I really wanted to give it five stars. The previews were amazing, and the online reviews and promo were a bit misleading."
3,"Okay, but more humorous than scary","I pre-ordered this movie, because I was so excited to see it. I was disappointed, but I'm still glad I saw it because I love halloween movies. Trick 'r Treat is not a scary movie. It's like Goosebumps, but with blood, death, and some nudity. It was okay, but I should have just rented the movie instead of buying it."
3,Liked the movie,"I liked the movie but the DVD seems to be having troubles with the player, will start up and then stop and the DVD player makes a loud click click click sound like its dying trying to get the movie going but then will get going."
3,Slasher Shocker,"I should qualify my comments by saying up front that I am not a shock/slasher fan and prefer more atmospheric style horror films. My favorite horror film is a ghost story starring George C. Scott, called ""The Changeling"". Very, very, scary and no blood, knives, or deranged psycho-killers are included.With several adventures involving different groups of people on one Halloween night, Trick 'r Treat came across a bit under-developed to me. I liked how the stories intertwined, sort of a Halloween Pulp Fiction, but some segments did seem stunted by their brevity. The Red Ridinghood segment in particular seemed more like a (albeit effective) punchline than a well presented story.I can't say Trick 'r Treat was bad, and there were a few elements I liked, but there was very little that made you think or feel anything other than the jolts of shock or disgust with grizzly human behavior. I'd prefer if they put the knives away and came up with a more creative approach to scaring people."
1,BOOOO,I was happy the movie arrived so fast so my family and I sat down to watch it and we were so disappointed.Half way through the movie my son fell asleep.It wasn't scary at all.For a real horror fan this was a waste of time but for someone who easily gets scared this is for you.To each is own but I say NEXT!!!
1,GOOD REVIEWS MUST BE FROM THE MOVIE CREW! BEWARE!,"What a LETDOWN! It made for a great trailer but it was a MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT overall! It played like a VERY politically correct episode of 'Tales From the Crypt'! The lame PC twists are clearly designed to appeal to preppy mainstream fans but will make real horror movie fans roll their eyes in disgust! I wanted to really like this movie but it was TOTALLY generic in every possible way! People like this only because so many new movies suck, but that's no reason to elevate this crap! Don't buy it or you'll be sorry. If you must watch it rent it. You'll be saving yourself some money because you most likely won't want to watch it twice."
4,A fun horror movie,"I'm a fan of classic monster movies and I liked this film quite a bit. I liked that it created a mythology around the holiday, like Jack 'O Lanterns are used to protect us from evil spirits, etc. I liked that we see what happens when those evil spirits are unchecked. Most of the scares are in the vein of the Creepshow movies, but that's OK. I'm sick of seeing endless slasher flicks. Serial killers are so boring, you see them on the news every day. Give me a monster any day. Monsters suggest that maybe we don't know all the rules; that our world does offer some magic and mystery.I thought that the film's flexible timeline a la Pulp Fiction was quite inventive. The individual stories are woven together by the presence of a kid in a creepy costume with a burlap mask. We learn that all is not what it seems.If you're after maximum shock and gore, this film is not for you. If you enjoy the spirit of the better horror films, you will find this one to be quite fun."
5,instant halloween classic,"Trick R Treat is a fantastic film that deserves to been seen, it is without a doubt, an instant Halloween classic. It will be watched every October in my house. The movie is a must see, a true original idea, not another run of the mill, bad horror movie remake, this movie is the real deal. See it."
1,TRICK R TRASH,"THIS MOVIE WAS TERRIBLE. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. THE PREVIEW LOOKED GOD, BUT THE MOVIE IS NOT WORTH A DIME. NO STORY, JUST RANDOM SCENES OF GORE AND NONSENSE. BY THE WAY, DOES ANYONE WANT TO BUY A MOVIE?"
1,Junk!,"Yet another pile of trash to come out of Hollywood. This movie was horrible for the following reasons:1. Garbage storyline.2. Way too cliche but what do you expect coming out of Crappywood?3. Boring (I started to fall asleep during this one).4. NOT scary at all.5. Too much ""politically correct"" nonsense. Hollywood needs to stop pushing it's dirt-ridden agenda and let people think for themselves. Time to wake up people and stop letting these scumbags in Hollywood dictate what you see in movies/television.It's a shame what kind of trash is passed off as entertainment in this day and age. The people in Hollywood really are a disgrace. Too bad most of the target audience is brainwashed to accept this filth without a second thought. This movie was an absolute waste of money but I'm glad I only rented it from Amazon. If I had actually bought the DVD then it would be sitting in the dumpster where it belongs with the rest of Hollywood."
1,just tricked no treat,one of the worst horror dvd ever came out since the attack of the tomatos bad acting bad script
1,Bad Buy,"This movie was bad. You witness a few killings, but none of them are relative to anything. There is no real story line, you never know what that guy is on the cover of the film or what his significance is. I think there are like 5+ different killers, and like I said, it is just random killings. Waste of money if you ask me."
1,"so bad, should never been released on dvd","there are better horror movies on the sci-fi channel.this movie is one of the worst halloween movies made.no wonder they never released it in theaters.smart move by the movie company to rip you off on the dvd, and don't listen to all the fake reviews the people who work for the movie company put out."
1,Confusing and Lacking.,"This movie was about five plots in one. It jumped around so much and not everything came together in the end. I gave it one star because it was a little wierd and creepie but lacked a lot. If you watch it, be prepared to be confused."
3,Probably not for horror fans.,"Here's the thing: I liked this movie, but I hate scary movies. That should tell you something. It's too predictable to be frightening even to a wimp like me, but it is creepy in an atmospheric sort of way. It is also a little bit funny. I thought the disjointedness of the scenes worked well, since it's not supposed to be a flowing, natural night.That said, a few of the plot devices are ones that I'm tired of, and as I said, I don't watch a lot of horror movies. I won't talk about the things later on in the movie, but I will say, showing us the world through the killer's eyes at the beginning? Veeerrry original."
5,Trick 'r Treat Review,"Received this new DVD as advertised (New), great response time in shipment. Very Happy!!!!"
5,Creepiest movie I've ever seen,"I've seen alot of Crap, No Budget Horror flicks as wells as, Crap big budget horror flicks waiting for some movie to make some sort of impression on me. Most of the time they are very un inspiring. They are full of terrible acting and try to scare using gore or torture or some other overused vehicle. That being said, this movie blew them all out of the water. I was terrified. The stories were wonderful. The acting was great. I was having nightmares for days, and I havent had that since I watched the original Friday the Thirteenth when I was 8. This movie at least twice as good as that. If you like horror, buy this movie. Buy it now. Today!"
2,trick,A mess. No wonder it was never released on screen. Several stories going in many directions with nothing to tie them together except Ricci.
3,Horror movies,"This relates one story, but uses the short story format to pull them all together. It was interesting and a good one for the holiday (Halloween). I would watch again. It's a little confusing in trying to figure out who one character is, but the storyline works so it's not a big deal. Fun to watch."
4,all in the spirit of halloween!,"This movie was super cool.had everything it need it for a good halloween movie.It wasn't too silly and not too serious,just enough of everything to make this little movie good."
5,ONE of the better ones!,WOW!!! Aired this flic 2 years ago and was very disappointed at the DISTRIBUTION of this OUTSTANDING film. This film is in my top 5 of over the top films.
1,"Uhhmmmm, Noo.","Did not live up to its expectations, and shure as hell didnt live up to its trailor, not even worth renting, cast was bland (some other people think differently though, really makes me wonder..), straight to DVD for a reason.STAY AWAY."
1,garcia0607,"This movie was horrible. This movie just might be as worse or even more worse than the old B rated movies that Elvira use to show. It wasn't scary. It was VERY CONFUSING and hard to follow. I would have given it no stars, but Amazon won't let me. It's beyond me why anyone would give it the 4-5 star ratings that they did. Sooo buy Trick-r-Treat at your risk!!!!"
1,is this a joke ?,"I bought this movie based on the glowing reviews not only on this site but others as well. Huh??? This movie sucks!!!!Not, I repeat, not scary at all. For a movie to be scary there has to be the possibility that the same fate could happen to you. Thats what makes youcheck to see if your door is locked and your windows are closed..and what was that sound you just heard? This movie has none of that. If I had to picksomething positive to say, I guess I would say that the acting is decent by all, including the kids. The musical score delivered the usual frightening undertones.Overall though, I'm starting to doubt the quality of the Amazon reviews which started with the Wolf shirt and apparently continues with this terrible movie."
5,AWESOME HORROR FILM!,"Just adding in my two cents...this is a great horror film. NOT LOW BUDGET!!! Well produced, well acted, fun little story...a cool movie for the Halloween season...one of the better horror flicks....certain to become a classic. Great movie...entertaining as hell."
4,Pretty dang cool,"I really like this movie. It's actually several different stories combined into one. It's really awesome how they weaved all of the stories together. The stories are integrated with one another so well, that it's like you're watching an entire movie. I especially love the twists and the unsuspecting ending. The little trick or treater known as ""Sam"" is freakin awesome. Love this movie. I can't wait til next Halloween when I can watch it again!"
5,Very fun movie! Excellent production quality.,This movie was a really fun ride! The production quality was great. The dark sense of humor was amazing and the special effects were very well done. I especially enjoyed Dylan Baker's character. Give this movie a shot and I hope you enjoy it!(I watched this movie in streaming format on Amazon's video on demand in high quality (480p).
4,New & Different,"It's a different kind of horror movie, and I am about to watch it again because I loved this film."
2,Overrated,"I was very excited for this movie from the reviews I read and about it being a classic that got missed by most audiences. I did not like the movie at all and I love almost every horror movies. The plot was odd, the acting was sub-par. But the movie got shipped in a timely manner. So it's up to you!"
5,An Awesome HALLOWEEN Film!!!,"I have waited two long years for this HALLOWEEN film, and I am glad that they finally released it! I loved everything about it; the cool costumes, the sweet HALLOWEEN decorations, all the jack 'o lanterns, the Marilyn Manson music, the HALLOWEEN parade and much more. The movie tells four stories that occur on this dark HALLOWEEN night. Some things happen out of order, but told again later through the perspective of another character. We meet Principal Wilkins who poisons candy. Have a 'killer' party with a beautiful woman named Laurie who will a blood feast with her sisters. Revisit the HALLOWEEN School Bus Massacre as a few kids play a nasty prank on a girl named Rhonda, but it turns out that the dead kids on the bus wanna come out and play. Finally, we meet a pint-sized trick-or-treater with a burlap pumpkin mask named Sam (Samhain) who will kill for a candy bar. If you love anything and everything regarding HALLOWEEN, you'll love TRICK 'R TREAT!!!"
2,Not that Good,"I was really expecting more based upon all the hype about this movie. I was not impressed. I've seen better scary movies on LMN. Make sure you watch it for free, don't pay anything to rent this awful movie."
1,Dirty Movie,The nudity and general smut in this movie was very unnecessary. It ruined the entire movie. It could have been a decent movie had they not thrown sexuality into it. Plus this movie isn't scary at all. The witch was a very likeable character and the little pumpkin man on the front is actually very cute so it's hard to see him as an evil being when he is so adorable. There are better movies out there to watch on Halloween.
2,A huge disappointment,"This movie did not live up to my expectations at all. It felt very slight, and undercooked. It has an extremely shot running time and is not very scary. The characters in the movie could have used a backstory that gave them more weight and substance. In the end, none of the stories add to much at all and the movie feels highly insubstantial. The only thing I would praise about this movie was its cinematography, which was excellent. Overall the movie did not live up to the buzz and was very underwhelming. I do not recommend this film to horror fans."
3,"Lots of imagination, nowhere to go with it","If you're a fan of comic-book horror anthologies such as Tales from the Crypt or Creepshow then you'll definitely like Trick 'R Treat. Although more cohesive then the independent stories of the aforementioned series' Trick 'R Treat may not end up as fondly remembered.Four stories featuring a serial killing principal, a desperate virgin, bullying teenagers, and a lonely old man are linked together by a recurring demonic little character called Sam, apparently a child with a bag over his head. Sounds interesting, but virtually nothing is explained and the existence of all the most imaginative elements is skipped over entirely. It's like the filmmakers had loads of great ideas but absolutely no foundation for them.Still, it's very slick, highly atmospheric, mildly scary and occasionally funny. A film any horror fan should pick up for cheap.The Blu Ray has a great-looking 1080p 2.40:1 picture with a decent Dolby TrueHD sound design. Extras are plentiful."
5,It's About Time!,"Finally a new age original, well thought out horror film! What a breath of fresh air, this film had everything that makes a horror movie great. A great plot that keeps the viewers attention, some humorous comedy, a beautifully executed lead killer, good acting and casting, and just enough gore to make it a complete horror film. The film did a great job of substituting cheap scares using loud noises with non-predictable twists and turns. The biggest shock in this film is how well thought out and made it is and how important it will become in the Halloween/Horror genre of movies. I only hope they don't ruin it with 10 brain dead sequels (Halloween 3-8). HIGHLY HIGHLY recommended to any patiently waiting horror fan."
3,Trick 'r Treat,"I do enjoy this movie but... It is not as good as everyone is making it out to be. Don't get me wrong it is a good movie and is fun, just NOT ""one of the best horror movies ever!""!...thats all"
4,A New Halloween Tradition,"This film is a neat little anthology centered on Halloween in which all of the stories interweave and interconnect with each other, rather than being presented as stand-alone segments. This approach works very well. Some scenes that don't make clear sense when first viewed will be perfectly understandable when put into context the next time they are glimpsed. Vampires, boogeymen, the dangers trick-or-treaters face, and a small goblin-like creature are just some of the film's goodies. Viewers should be warned that certain themes might not be appropriate for children, especially young children. The best thing about the film is that it captures the spirit of the holiday like no film since John Carpenter's Halloween did, and around here, at least, it will be brought out every October to celebrate Halloween, a new tradition. Recommended."
5,The perfect blend of everything a Horror movie should be,I just watched Trick 'r Treat and thought it was very original and entertaining..I loved the throwback cheese appeal and the the way the stories intertwined was genius..This isn't a film for someone expecting a hard core gore fest although it did have it's moments~!The cinematography and costume design were awesome..I'm sure it will be a new movie tradition for halloween.A horror icon is born in Sam who already has his own action figure..If you are a fan of movies that aren't intended to take themselves to seriously then this is for you..I loved it.. It is touted as Horror/Comedy so remember this before viewing~!I have watched it twice.The Characters were cleverly thought out and the casting perfect.A winner~!
2,So So,The movie is fun but really nothing to crow about. If you can get it cheap enough then its worth it.
3,trick r treat,some of the bad reviews i saw talked about how the characters who died where undeserving.its a horror movie what do you expect.when you first walk into a theater ready to watch a horror movie.do you say i hope no fat or special kids die in this movie.then this isnt the movie for you.who cares who dies its a horror movie.its just actors.do you want it to be a life time movie.here is my problem with it. it looks like it was made to be a HBO movieand for you who have watched HBO you know what im talking about.
5,A Halloween Gift,Thoroughly enjoyed movie - new classic to watch at Halloween. It arrived in a prompt and timely manner and was packaged very nicely. I would recommend this vendor as a reputable dealer with quality products.
2,"Not bad, but certainly not a classic","After seeing the trailer and reading many positive reviews, I purchased this movie. It has some solid moments, but, overall it is not that good. It does have scary moments and is a horror movie that is not completely based on a slasher theme or a torture theme, which is prevalent in many current horror movies. It does have some humor and at times a campy element to it. It does have a halloween theme to it, but that does not make this a seasonal classic. For diehard horror fans, it is worth seeing, but it is no masterpiece. I can understand why this movie did not get a theatrical release. It deserves to be a straight-to-video movie."
2,Not Very Good,As a dedicated Horry Movie Person I have to say this one is not that good especially with all the cool actors and who produced the Movie. I'd skip this DVD.
2,Average at best,"This movie looks really good as it was shot quite well , but i spent more time laughing , there really is nothing scary here at all , average run of the mill cheap gore , average acting , loose stories at best .... if your into Horror you have seen all this before & much better , Anna paquin fans , she is not in the movie that much (in case you were buying for that reason.I liked how they tied the stories together , but the end result is another run of the mill Fail-fest ...oh well , maybe Next time ."
1,Poor Script,Vapid dialogue. All characters are one-dimensional. Each story is fundamentally boring. No scares or suspense.
1,Sore disappointment,This movie was nothing I thought it would be. I got bored watching it. I thought it was pretty dumb.
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR HARD EARNED ON IT!,"All the hype around this film was just that,HYPE. It's nothing special or scary in the least.Don't compare it to ""Creepshow"" or ""Tales from the Darkside"" movies because these a Great Horror Films! This one is just a waste."
1,Not scary at all.,"Others have compared Trick r Treat to CREEPSHOW. I would agree with that. For me that movie was/is not scary. When I saw the cover to the DVD I thought it looked like it could give me a ""jump"" or two. But I sat there very disappointed. The movie itself looked beautiful, but it's just not scary. I guess I expected a Michael Myers or Jason type movie. IMOP it's a very ""safe"" horror movie. Definitely rent it first."
1,Uninspired and not scary at all,All the short stories were underdeveloped and uninspired. They were not scary or creepy in the least. Stay away from this poorly executed film.
1,This movie is junk...,"i own over 100 bluray movies and watch movies frequently. After reading many reviews, i was excited to finally see this movie. Trick r Treat is a terrible movie. This movie should not even be classified as a horror movie. The stories within this movie are junk. This movie is not scary nor creepy. Trust me, this film is awful. There is always a reason why movies come straight to dvd rather than hitting the theaters before hand. I laughed through half the movie because the acting and storyline was just plain stupid. I'm still pissed i spent 5.00 to rent it at blockbuster. I cant imagine why you would pay 20.00-25.00 to buy this garbage movie."
4,A New Halloween Tradition In The Making,"I just got done watching this, and I thought it was great. It was just a fun movie to watch. It wasn't to scary (all though it did have its moments) it was more suspencefull and unsettling/disturbing at times, cause alot of stuff has to do with children. The different stories tie in well and will definitely warrant a second viewing because I'm sure I'll pick up some things I missed. I'm only giving it 4 stars because I wish it had been longer with more developed characters. A couple of these stories could be made into full length movies in my opinion; and because of that I felt like I needed more story from them. But they do a good job getting the point across in the time they have so this is a minor complaint. So if you're thinking of getting this, go for it, this is a great watch."
4,Now this is just plain fun,"I'm not sure if this is the best Halloween movie in 30 years, but there is not much here not to like (how anyone could give it one star is beyond me). Excellent pacing, rarely a dull moment, and it is shot in a style you'd expect to find in the cinema. The acting is beyond what you'd get in an average slasher movie, and the variety makes this film a treat. You get fangs, deadly children, demented neighbors, and curious little imp that appears in each of the stories.Aside from the comic book comparison, I find little in common with Creepshow, and it has more intensity and less black humor than Tales from the Crypt. Each of the four tales in the story are unique, though with a common theme, and occur in the same town on Halloween night. The stories are seamless and at times interweave with each other, making for a satisfying, if not fairly hurried, conclusion. It's a town with a secret, and the journey through its frightening underbelly is a treat."
4,Will become THE Halloween tradition.,"Nothing infuriated me more to know that Warner Bros. was withholding what some trustworthy horror critics were calling their favorite horror anthology since Creepshow and while this film still deserves the big screen treatment, I am very thankful that everyone can now witness the perfect razor blade caramel apple that is Trick 'R Treat.Trick 'R Treat is that film that deserves a yearly revisit before the kids go out to leech treats from people's hands or toilet paper their ex-girlfriend's house.I won't even bother spoiling one moment of this lovingly written, directed and photographed masterpiece. Instead, like any fine candy, just pop it in and savor."
4,"NO CLASSIC but NO DUD, either!","OK, LOTSA FOLKS HERE GOIN' OVERBOARD w/ the reviews! 'TrT' isn't exactly a classic but it's not horrible crap either. It moved at a good clip, didn't take itself too seriously, it's got Anna Paquin (sweet!) & Dylan Baker, a few surprises (but no major jolts, unless you are under 15 years old), plenty of refs to other horror movies...is sorta 'Creepshow' crossed w/ 'Pulp Fiction' style-wise, altho not nearly as swell as either of 'em. Minor spoiler: Nice touch having some pre-teenage victims (most movies of this sort have stupid, evil, and/or horny teens or adults as the killed). Well-worth a rental or a cheap purchase as long as yr expectations aren't too high!"
5,4.5 stars,"It's very good! It's very entertaining, pretty funny, it has some nice twists and it reminds a lot of the first 2 Creepshow movies, BUT the people who think that it's one of the best horror movies ever are crazy! Hell, I can name 3 or 4 horror movies from THIS YEAR that are better! Anyway, not one of the best horror movies ever or of the last 30 years or of the last 20 years, but probably one of the best horror movies of the last 6 years. Definitely wouldn't mind more horror movies like it."
4,"No Trick, it's a Treat","T r T is a cool little flick.Full of hotties, candy and nice storylines.Paquin is attractive, as usual, and her cast mates do a pretty good job of bringing the spirit of Halloween to the screen.pick this one up for some nice little spookytime.>:-)"
4,A fun Halloween Horror Movie,"I am not usually one for remakes but this was edgy, fun, and well done. It's one of my favorite movies to watch during the Halloween season. Just remember: always check your candy, never blow out the jack o' lanterns before morning, and ALWAYS have treats for the trick or treaters. ;)"
1,not good,"sorry, but I think is not good the envelope because the glue not seal well, I have to get another box with another system to close the envelope, may be the box you send me, whith the envelopes Quality Park # 10, Rediseal was too old and the glue in bad conditions to seal"
4,military rifles,"Very nice book. I think it goes into detail very well and includes many popular Military rifles. Some rifles that I was more interested in did not have an individual chapter but were lumped in one chapter as ""Others"". I would like to see more on them and not quite so in depth on the others. I think the author touched on what he liked and did not give all rifles equal research and coverage. Just my opinion."
2,Broad but shallow,"This book is a broad and moderately detailed history of the development of the military bolt action. For someone just getting interested in the subject, it would provide a useful general guide, but it lacks sufficient detail and depth to be useful as a reference for anyone other than the most casual collector. In fact, I was quite dissapointed by the paucity of information related to actually collecting these rifles, given that that is what the book purports to be. If the book were titled as a history it would certainly have fulfilled my expectations, but even with that it is too expensive for what it delivers. I returned mine."
3,reference only,Lacks substance. You may not find this book very helpful if your more than a beginer at collecting guns.
3,Good history,"This book is a pretty good history for bolt action military rifles, however a serious collector will find little value in this book."
1,Too much not well done not worth the money,I have the 2.0 of this and it was wonderful my Dad pasted away and had the 4.0. I loaded it up what a mess it is. I can't find anything on it. Don't waste the money if you don't use the web to get stuff free just get the 2.0 It will have all you could ever need unless you are working on you Dr. and need every version of the Bible ever print even in Spanish! With notes from a dozen men.
4,"Dark tale of loss, murder, and revenge","After a four year hiatus, the German progressive metal act returns with a concept album based on the Count of Monte Christo. Say what you want about the subject matter, but Vanden Plas churn out a dark tale of loss, murder, and revenge set to a back drop of excessive riffs, striking vocals, and dynamic orchestral elements."
2,Predictably derivative,"Bland, boring, generic second-rate Dream Theater clones exhibit all the bombast and little of the songwriting intellect only a few bands of the prog-metal genre posses."
5,Top of the Line for Progressive Concept Albums!,"I bought this cd because I was looking for concept albums after getting into the genre through Coheed & Cambria. Although this album is nothing like that band, like CoCa, Vanden Plas has some incredible keyboard and guitar riffs straight from heaven! Don't miss ""Silently"", easily one of the most complex songs I have ever heard in this genre. The lyrics are incredibly intelligent, based (sorta) on the story of the Count of Monte Christo. This cd hasn't left my cd player for a full year, it has only been outlasted by Beyond the Veil from Tristania (different genre, but just as intelligent.) My favorite song on this cd is easily ""Fireroses Dance"", it has everything from a slower, epic beginning to angry choruses. If you are looking for a cd with meaning and killer composition, don't pass this up!"
1,poor quality,"So very disappointed! I was excited to see these earrings online as my mother had lost one that looked very similar. Sadly, my mother and I were disappointed with the quality of the posts and gold around the cameo. The posts were not only short but the posts were very thin and frail. One post broke off within two days and the other would bend with every attempt my mother made to insert it into her ear. I can not recommend these earrings."
1,Bad design,"It doesn't have a separate cover for each compartment. Instead, there is one cover for each day's morning & noon, and another for bed and evening. The covers have a hinge in the middle so that you can open one compartment at a time -- supposedly. When I lift the section over the ""morning"" compartment, the ""noon"" compartment won't stay shut.Also, since the covers are attached in the middle, the bottom compartments have to be switched so that ""evening"" (the bottom one) opens first, and ""bed"" opens after that. It would be easy to get these mixed up."
3,Same act...different CD...,"If you don't have Jeff's prior album ""I'll Flip You Like a Cheese Omelette"" you'll appreciate this one. The sound is great. However, if you do own the prior CD, this is basically the same act... I was disappointed--I really like Jeff Altman and was looking forward to some different stuff."
4,Shipped quickly and Jeff Altman is really funny.,Was sent right away & just like it stated I would buy again as I don't like games & they did not play any.
5,Review from AIDS Book Review Journal,"""Excellent...A highly recommended book for all academic and medical libraries...Should be read by anyone who is administering and HIV prevention program."""
4,OK,"For the price, I got what I paid for($3.sumthin + shipping). Nothing against the seller. The seller was great! I accidently placed a double order, then cancelled, and the seller contacted me right away asking if I wanted the other. The game is fun. There are 5 games to play. Each game has different segments. The only thing is once you have played 1 of the games, it doesnt change. It doesnt have a bunch of trivia that is pulled up randomly after a game is played for same game(If that makes sense). Again seller was great! Super fast shipping!"
2,No replay value,"As other reviewers have pointed out, the game has no replay value. There are a number of pre-determined games on the DVD and nothing else once you are done with them. But for five bucks, it's decently entertaining."
4,Not bad,"I enjoy family guy. But I am not so ""into it"" that I would personally choose to order this game.I ordered it for the boyfriend.He thoroughly enjoyed it, though it's a little confusing at first and pretty fast.We've only played it twice in four months. Thought we do try to switch our games up regularly, so it's no fault of the game's."
4,Not bad,You go through all of the questions pretty fast - if yu play more than and hour. But all in all not a bad game for true Family Guy fans.
3,"Fun, but not much too it.",The title pretty much says it all. The game is TONS of fun. Especially for Family Guy Fans..but there's not a whole lot too it. Granted it's nice not to have to worry about score keeping (The Game does it for you)
3,Family Guy isn't my thing but great gift for a fan,"I purchased this for two reasons:1. My son is a fan2. It was a really good priceFor the price I purchased this game at, it's a fun ""stocking stuffer"" type gift. He loved it, it provided a bit of entertainment and worked as described."
4,Well worth the money,"The game is really amusing, and there is definitely a good amount of variety! There are only 10 games total, but it was enough to keep me and my friends entertained. Some of the questions were a little weird and difficult, such as fill-in-the-blank and putting different images in the right chronological order...but overall a pretty good mix for all sorts of fans. Plus, it's probably one of the only Family Guy games of its kind out there!"
3,Family Guy,"instructions are a little confusing at first, but gets easier. Fun game but you need to know your Family Guy characters."
3,gift,the item came promptly and was easy to purchase. It was a gift. I have no feedback on how well it was enjoyed by the recipiant.
2,"It was a gift and I got the dreaded complaint, yikes!","I gave this DVD game to a friend as a gift, someone who loves ""Family Guy"" and the other night was asked if i could return it. OOps, that isn't what you expect to hear about a gift. I asked why? And they informed me that the game wasn't enjoyable because it would constantly freeze up and have trouble playing. I asked perhaps it was the dvd player? They told me the bottom of the disc appeared scratched and they take excellent care of how they handle DVD's so it must have come that way.I said, I would take it to my home and test it on my DVD player when I had time. I will update the review when I test it on my DVD player. Anyway, today i got asked for a review from amazon and am just writing my experience with this purchase so far. I hope this helps prepare others."
4,"If you're a Family Guy fan, it's a lot of fun","This game is the ultimate game for the Family Guy fan. All you need is the DVD. There are no other elements to worry about. I'm a big fan and I can tell that they've selected some of the best clips from the series; in short, my friends and I laughed our butts off as we played. And contrary to what the guy said above, there are a lot more than 5 games, and while there are only two teams, it just makes the game play faster and smoother. It has plenty of content for a few hours of game play, and the only gripe I have is that I wish it had a little more. Maybe they'll release a follow up. All in all, it's worth the money."
3,Cool the first time around,"We were so excited to find this game and bought it expecting to have a lot of fun with it. In fact, the first few times we played it we thought it was great. But unfortunately, there is absolutely no replay value. Where there are 10 game options to choose from, the questions are always the same and in the same order whenever you choose a game you have played previously. Since I own other DVD games that do not do this I was very disappointed when we figured this out."
5,"""You have smelly dog farts...""","Lots of fun! Hilarious video and sound clips, but remember this is a DVD game! There are only 10 games and they do not rotate the questions. For the price, it is worth it. Great for the casual fan to the fan-atic. The questions rang from ""duh!"" to ""huh?"". You don't have to worry about keeping score. At the end of each round you check off which team answered correctly on screen. Great game, Tons of fun! Recommended!"
4,Fun For Family Competition,My whole family really enjoyed the game. We love the Family Guy and it was great to test our knowledge.It was a definite break from just sitting together and watching TV. It caused us some hilarious moments!The directions were very clear and it was so easy to use!
4,Family Guy,"I love anything family guy, so does my fiance and we had so much fun competing to see who would win."
2,Don't spend more than $6 - $7 for this (including shipping),"The game is fun, especially for Family Guy fans. There are 10 levels each with 5 questions per level. Problem is once you go through all of them they repeat the same questions in the same order. Fun the first time around but that's about it. I got it from a privaate seller here at Amazon for a good price so it was worth it for me."
4,GURPS Martial Arts,"GURPS Martial Arts is a book with lots of different martial arts styles for your characters. It also includes maneuvers, which are like skill subsets. I really like how this book lets you build your own martial arts styles. Martial Arts also includes tables for all the weaponry, such as Sai (for anyone who's ever watched Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Raf uses a pair of these).A lot of the illustrations are gory, reminding you that GURPS was never meant for kids (Steve Jackson Games should make that clearer, I think). BUT, aside from the ""Silly Combat Rule"" Bulletproof Nudety, there's no adult content! And while there's gore in some of the pictures, everyone's fully clothed. That's really, really nice."
1,Wait for other recordings,"It's maddening to be a Luciano Virgili fan, finally get a Cd to replace some of your worn out recordings, only to find they've chosen the wrong recordings to transfer. Virgili has suffered enormously from transferrals to discs. The brassy, noisy, intrusive accompaniment on this and other CDs currently available detracts from his beautiful voice. There are better recordings, but why they haven't decided to transfer those, I just don't understand. For me, the discs currently available are unlistenable."
4,Very good Intro to DB2,"If you aren't a database expert and you want to learn DB2, this book will do it. After using this book, you will be able to use DB2 very effectively. The authors did a great job.The CD contains an older version of DB2, but it is sufficient to learn DB2. You can quickly learn the later versions, which can usually be downloaded from IBM as evaluation copies."
3,DB2 for Dummies,"I have not had a chance to fully evaluate the text, but I would like to inform others about the CD that contains a version of DB2. This version according to the book is for PC's which have either Windows NT or Windows 2000."
3,"Not Great Storytelling, but Not Painfully Inaccurate","As with her other Circle of Three Books, the author is telling the story of three high school girls becoming active with the Wiccan Religion. The story is ok, though not the most exciting. I give her good marks for not resorting to Hollywood special effects type of magick and striving to be more accurate in the depiction of Wicca than similar books. Probably the most unbelievable part, three high school girls under 18 being allowed to study with a coven (highly unlikely without parental written permission, if even then), has to be accepted with a willing suspension of disbelief for the series to work."
3,Failed to meet my high expectations,"This was a pretty good book, but a lot of the 1,001 ""secrets"" left a lot to be desired. Most of the info was simple common sense. Didn't much care for the author's arrogance, either. Be advised that this is a fairly expensive book, considering what you get for your money."
3,"Sort of an Update of ""Tao of Jeet Kune Do""","The format and layout is similar to ""Tao of JKD"" but also covers weapons, including handguns. Offers some (about 300 ""secrets"") useful ""concepts/principles"" but if you are expecting instruction on techniques, you'll be disappointed. Many (another 600 ""secrets"") of the 1001 ""secrets"" are really so obvious that readers will find themselves saying-""duh."" The rest of the so called street-fighting principles (that leaves 101) are just the author's recitation of his political philosophy. All in all, not junk, but you'll get more for your money (...""1001 Secrets"" is expensive) out of Bruce Lee's original than out of this imitation."
5,The Final Word,"In this book Sammy Franco gives the final word (until his next book comes out) on what is needed to survive the violent streets of today's world. It lays a strong foundation for both the how to and the philosophy and theory underlying actual streetfighting. It warns of the dangers of many old formal schools, and provides the tools needed in the ""no rules"" situations we risk facing in real life. An excellent book."
5,Onderweg- Wonderful,"Saw the Music Video for the title song while in Amsterdam Feb. 2000... I don't know Dutch, nonetheless found the tune and words haunting and lyrical... I assumed it was from a newly released album and found myself searching for two days the many, many ""mom and pop"" music stores in Amsterdam. ONLY to be told it was the band's first single- and not even out on a CD single... I have been looking forward to the ""entire album"" since that time.... and have found it to be wonderful."
5,"Great, Hard To Find CD Of Album","I looked around everywhere for this as a CD. Even as the original record album, this is a difficult title to obtain. One of the problems is that the actual title of the album is ""Sweet Soul Sensation"", but many searches of it can only be pulled up if you key in ""Sweet Soul Sensations"" (with an 's' at the end of Sensation) - even this CD album was only found when keying it in with the 's'. This was the first single I had ever purchased as a child, and cannot tell you how happy I am in getting the whole album, much less in CD form, despite its price. Thanks for a very quick delivery."
3,Industrial hits,"I thought it wasn't bad. I use to listen to this stuff like twenty years ago, still like it. Brought back a lot of good memories. Good compulation of industrial music."
2,What'sTHISfor!?!,"In what universe is this a compilation of ""hits"". There is certainly a preponderance of remixes and cover versions of Industrial hits but only a handful of songs that would have got anyone up on a dancefloor in the 90s, at least here in Australia. It seems like a ham-fisted effort, at best, and I think people woudl be better off looking for some old compilations fromn back in the day."
1,Older info,This book is very general mostly about the condition of the russian airforce at the beginning of WW11 and how it was wiped out very little new information
3,Remember Me&#65533;,"Raw hurt, challenge, sensitivity and anger leads most to stand up for what you believe in and what you won't stand for. In SEEDS OF REMEMBRANCE, Adria Husband reveals all that she was, is, and chooses to be. With unquestionable feeling, these poetry selections allow readers to understand, relate and empathize with real-life situations in which she writes.The depth of emotion outlined within these pages weaves a tale of betrayal, disgust, rooting for your man and giving up when you know it's over. This passionate display of innermost thoughts captures and grabs your attention. Although some may not be able to relate, this is definitely a pick-me up book for someone nursing heartache. While there were a few typographical errors, it did not detract from the overall intended message. One thing is certain - if the person(s) who gave Adria Husband the inspiration read this, they would definitely remember her...Reviewed by T. Belinda Williamsof The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers"
5,Fun Food for All,"We bought this for my two year olds birthday and he loved it. He loves slicing the food apart, stacking the sandwich and giving it to us to eat. It is much better then that flimsy plastic food you can buy in bulk. It is a good size (not too tiny) and strong enough to hold up to little boy hands. Plus, not too girly for my husband. (smile) Highly recommend this and the veggie/fruit set we bought that was the same style."
3,Not very impressed,"This set is fine, but the bread is a little small. The other items are pretty thick, making the sandwich very thick. The tuna can is cute, the lid is velcroed on. Overall, I didn't care much for it. The Subway set is a much nicer sandwich set."
5,Beautiful watch,"Seiko makes a great product and this is one of the lovliest watches I have even seen made by them. It is a delicate timepiece perfect for someone that wants a subtle look, and it was a great price."
4,Seiko Watch Women's,The Seiko Women's SUJB30 Watch is an excellent product - it is silver and gold so can go with any jewelry you wear. It can be casual or dress up. I have owned it for 3 years and the battery is still good. The face is easy to see. Highly recommended.
5,Hildago,"Great movie, alot of action. I loved the horse; if you're a horse lover, this is a great one to watch. Really liked the main character."
5,makes you legal for not a lot of $$,"good value. the bag is nice to have, keeps them together and clean. The mesh on the bag is a nice touch as it lets the bag breath."
5,mmmm,"These incense smell amazing, i was reading the histories by Herodotus and it always talks about how people would receive as gifts frankincense and myrrh because they were extremely valuable(and used in many religious ceremonies), Kings would receive them and offer them to those they thought of as worthy, and you can tell why!!!!!"
2,"Very soft metal, bad packaging","These skewers are made of a very soft steel. It feels like aluminium.The outside cardboard box was intact, but the actual product package inside was open. I bet someone gave me a returned purchase."
5,Outset Skewers with Rosewood Handles,"These skewers are great. At first I thought they were too long, but in using them I think they are the perfect length. They have a point to use inserting the food and are flat so when I turn the skewers the food doesn't turn too. I highly recommend."
4,Maui fun in the great outdoors,"Maui begs to be explored and Trailblazer never ceases to provide hours upon hours of excitement, adventure, and exceptional hiking. No other guide remotely comes close to the detail or precision that trailblazer has in regards to hiking. If you're the type of individual who yearns to see the great outdoors, the scenery that is often forgotten in paradise, then Trailblazer is a must."
3,Its a book and goes out of date fast.,"When you spend a lot of money on a trip to Maui, you want your vacation to be great. This book helps out, but the problem is that all books go out of date fast. Places change, I would recommend you save your money and use the internet to get up to date reviews."
3,"Lots of information, but usability is lacking","When I first got this book, I was so excited. SO excited! It's chock-full of information about lots of fun destinations. However, when I started to plan places to go, I found the book very hard to use. The book will give an instruction like ""drive on Hwy 30 towards Lahaina"". Since no starting point is established, it's up to you to figure out if the instructions are for drivers headed north vs. south! This is key. Maui Revealed is much better in this regard, because it uses terms like ""mauka"" (meaning mountain-side) and ""makai"" (meaning water-side). Hence, the directions make sense regardless of your approach! With much effort, one can use the maps provided in Maui Trailblazer, along with relative positions of sites listed in the text, to figure out how to find these fantastic sounding places. But when you're on the road, actually *navigating*, you don't have time to mess about with that kind of work. This is vacation, after all."
3,a suggestion,"This book has some excellent info in it, but has one glaring weakness, in my opinion: It needs more maps!! There are great trail details, but essentially no detailed maps. For me this was a problem. I need maps to find places. I used this book in conjunction with Maui Revealed, which makes a nice combination. I will say that I used Maui Revealed much more because of its many excellent detailed maps."
2,better books out there,"The setup of the book seemed odd to me...it is not set up for on the go reading. SOME directions, walking and driving, in this book are confusing at best, with draw-backs to earlier mentions in the book. The best part of this book, is the table of contents lists (best snorkeling beaches, best people watching beaches, best hike-to beaches); It IS very helpful for kayaking and hiking. I wouldn't buy it as a stand alone guide."
2,Rather boring,I would not recommend this book. It was hard to follow at times and not as fun to read compared to Maui revealed. On our last day we stayed at a place that had Maui Revealed and we were sorry we didn't have it in the first place.
4,Good book,Maui Trailblazer is a good guidebook to have. Not as detailed as other guidebooks but still worth it to have.
2,Maps and information missing,"The Book includes a lot of hikes and nice spots on Maui but it was not a big help anyway. Some parts are written nicely, but this applies mostly to the car parts.The different hikes are not rated by difficulty and also no estimated time is given. Even worse is that maps of the hikes are missing so you lack orientation when you are on your way - I personally would even appreciate topographical maps - but not even knowing which trails I would cross or whether there were any alternative routs was very annoying. Furthermore description of the trail heads is unclear. Different hikes that are not alternative routes are described in the same chapter which makes reading confusing. All together I can not recommend this book, especially not as a full travel guide to Maui or as your only hiking guide there."
4,Very Handy Magnifier - Recommended!,"The OptiCard is a wallet card sized magnifier with a built in light. I found the magnification to be fairly good and it doesn't cause too much distortion if viewed straight on. The light is surprisingly bright and can be turned on by pressing a small button on the card.This is a convenient sized, functional gadget that works as expected. Note that the Opticard comes in several designs and styles, but they all work the same.Recommended!"
4,exactly as advertised,I am very happy with the magnify readers. It would have been nice to be able to pick out the design but that is not a deal breaker.
4,Get Old; Buy This,Sitting in the dark in restaurants and can't read the menu? Buy this for yourself and all your friends.
1,Seemed like such a good idea,"I bought this from my local yarn shop. Before buying it, I looked it over, saw the four screws, and assumed that it could be maintained indefinately. When it stopped lighting up, I removed the little screws to change the battery. Well apparently those screws are just for show, because I could not get the card apart. If I had known this was disposable, I would never have bought it."
3,Competent adaptor for a lo&#447; price,"Even ou&#541; e title does not give e name, is is a D-Tech Bluetoo USB Adaptor 100M (meaning t it hs a range of 100 meters, compared to 300 for ne&#447;er adaptors). e package contains e adaptor nd a USB exten&#383;ion cable. One plus is t it u&#383;es &#383;tandard protocols, &#447;hich means t it is compatible &#447;i Linux (Ich am u&#383;ing e 2.6.16 kernel). One dra&#447;bck is t e ca&#383;e for e adaptor is flim&#383;y, nd Ich ea&#383;ily lo&#383;t e antenna fter e ca&#383;e &#447;s t&#447;i&#383;ted. Fortunately, e adaptor &#383;till &#447;orked even &#447;i e loß of e antenna. e adaptor al&#383;o did not &#447;ork &#447;ell &#447;i interference on e bck of a large computer ca&#383;e. is is &#447;hre e USB exten&#383;ion cable came in handy. But for a &#383;imple adaptor for u&#383;e next to a cell phone (in is ca&#383;e, a Sony Ericsson Z520a) it &#447;orked fine."
2,Piece of junk,"I encourage many to stay away from this usb product; like previous reviewers said, just spend the extra money on a better usb dongle. As soon as i got this thing out of its package, i almost snapped the casing off due to its poor construction.The main problem that i have experienced with this product is that although its range is ok(not the 100 meters that it claims), as soon as i go into a room thats only 10 feet away, has doors or walls in the way, the reception starts to fluctuate in and out every 2 minutes."
1,Ditto to what everyone else wrote,"Poor construction, software that is difficult to install, unable to run when installed, and requires you to purchase a license to get a working copy. Buy something else that actually works."
1,Basic bluetooth dongle,"I am not using this bluetooth dongle because the accessory software was so darned difficult to set up. Instead, I cut my loses and purchased a different dongle which was truely plug-and-play."
3,It works BUT...,"Please note this review relates to the IVT BluesoleilWhen I saw the price I said WOW.That was about all the good news I had since, other than it works.Since then I've had (and continue to experience) several times when it hasn't connected properly. Restarting the computer fixed that.So far it doesn't work with the Sony Ericsson's SOFTWARE to connect via bluetooth (but that software's GUI is VERY poor itself). I had to run an update for the Nokia's SOFTWARE to get it to work.The BIGGEST problem is you cannot update the (IVT) Bluesoleil software without ""registering it"" for $20.00 as it doesn't come with a registration key at the initial purchase.You can check out this link for additional info: http://www.bluesoleil.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=37&PN;=1Read the last 3 posts especially and decide for yourselves."
1,PRODUCTO MAS PURA MIERDA,"ESTE PRODUCTO NO ES LO QUE ANUNCIAN,100 METROS DE ALCANCE Y SOLO PALABRAS NO SIRVE, NO LA DEBUELVO PORQUE ME SALE MAS CARO EL ENVIO DE LO QUE CUESTA ESTA PORQUERIA"
3,Quien diseño esto?,"El producto cumple su funcion, pero le pusieron una antena que aparte de inutil (porque es solo plastico y no cumple ninguna funcion dentro del producto), es estorbosa.Pero lo importante es que cumple su funcion"
1,"Shallow, disappointing and frustrating","This book had the potential to be great. Instead it falls short of the mark by a wide margin.Although the book provides a sound framework for developing and deploying solutions, it has a major flaw. Throughout the author raises interesting issues in the form of rhetorical questions, then ... nothing. Quite disapponting. Had the questions been followed by solutions or recommendations, then the book would have both substance and value. Substance by stepping up and providing viable answers and solutions to problems faced when developing and implementing internet solutions. Value by saving us from having to discover the answers on our own, wasting resources along the way.The whole point of buying a book such as this is to benefit from lessons learned. It is frustrating to realize that the book could have been a valuable resource had the author only taken the time to provide answers to the very questions he raised."
1,A waste of time and money!,This book gives a (poor) high level overview of project management and very little (worthless)information on Internet/Intranet specific issues. Does not offer value to any level of project manager. The first mention of anything to do with the Internet comes along in chapter 5 and is very weak.
3,Not Their Best,"I'm a Memory Makers fan and I tend to like their idea books. This one, however, seemed fairly uninspired to me. Lots of cute pages of cute toddlers doing cute toddler things -- but nothing that really sparked my creativity for scrapping the hundreds of photos that I have of my own cute toddler.A general scrapbooking book would probably take you just as far as this book would."
5,A great read,This is a great story nicely written. Enjoyed it very much would recommend highly to anyone who love to read about history.
3,"Some good, some average","Overall this selection of four short stories is a good read but frankly I was a little disappointed. ""A Proper Englishwoman"" by Eloisa James, was actually ""To Wed A Rake"" under a different title, so I was not off to a good start, particularly as I'd bought the book based on it featuring two of my favourite authors in Eloisa James and Julia London. Having said that, Julia London's contribution was light, entertaining, witty and well written so my spirits lifted, only to be somewhat flattened by the other two offerings, which I found to be pretty ordinary as far as the sentence structure, plot, dialogue and knowledge of the times. These things aren't all always necessary but one of two of these features would be good. I'm afraid I left the book feeling relieved to have reached the end."
5,Loved It,"Targ and Hurtak manage to pull together the best spiritual resources that humanity has at its disposal in order to illuminate the human dilemma of duality and suffering. The book is not a mere theoretical discussion of the problem (though there is a decent amount of that as well), but includes a number of helpful and practical spiritual tools. Some teachers that the work engages are: Buddha, Nagarjuna, Ramana Marashi, Shankara, Lao Tse, Aristotle, and many others.I suspect the book is not popular only because the consciousness level of mankind is simply not ready for it. 5/5"
5,I love it,Yes this is an excellent book - profound answers about life in the 3rd dimension - I have been studying for years and this had added information for my spiritual life journey - thanks
3,I Neither Liked Nor Disliked This Book,"Essentially, this book is a scattered assortment of topics from psi research, quantum theory and Buddhism which are supposed to culminate in the reader a sense of connectivity to the universe and in turn trivialize our earthy sufferings; sort of a new age version of the ""Don't Sweat the Small Stuff."" However, I really don't think that the authors have delivered on this premise. Although to some readers this book may serve as a semi-decent introduction to such topics as psychic phenomenon, quantum mechanics and Buddhism, overall, the explanations are superficial and don't come together in a coherent fashion to support what the book claims in its title. If you are looking for a more meaningful coverage of the relationship between quantum theory and psi, may I recommend ""Entangled Minds: Extrasensory Experiences in a Quantum Reality"" by Dean Radin."
5,Great Quality,"Top quality comforter at a very fair price. Heavy and isn't bulky like some expensive comforters that tent up and fall off of you, this one stays on you all night."
3,Nothing else available,I would think today mantles would be available which are not so fragile & would be much longer lasting....Would buy if I could find them
4,OK,"Bought this for my outdoor lamppost. The mantles were nearly too big for it. After giving it an initial burn then lighting the lamp, one of the mantles already developed a hole. Its been a couple of months now and the hole hasn't grown and they are still fairly bright. Since they are by far the cheapest I found, I feel it was a good buy. Even if the one mantle doesn't last terribly long, I have a couple of spares since this is a four pack."
5,Excellent product,Just what you'd expect from Coleman name. Good to be able to purchase in bulk. Expensive but you get what you pay for.
1,Typos,"I love Orwell. This review is about the Kindle edition, not the author: it has a problem with punctuation or a typo on every third page. Shame on Penguin."
5,Le Grandi Voci della canzone Italiana,"Translated into English the Title means "" The Greatest Voices of the Italian Song.""Luciano Tajoli is one of the greats of the Italian Serenade. He is in the same league as Claudio Villa , Carlo Buti etc. The voice of these artists was very good for the interpretation of the Italian serenade. Luciano Tajoli`s style oozed with the feeling of unrequited love. I have a number of disks , cassets, and long playing plastics records of this great singer. I often listen and never tire of them."
3,No Extras and Poor Duplication Quality!,"My two main gripes are the lack of any extras whatsoever, and the duplication quality was very underpar for being DVD!"
3,Some fun to be found here,"but I do wish I could have bought season one. I don't think I would have bought the follow up. After a while, it just gets to be more of the same."
1,WHERE ARE THE JAM PACKED NEWER VERSIONS,"I AM A DIE HARD FAN AND AM STILL WAITING FOR THE ""SUPERIOR BOX SET"""
5,Classic Pee Wee!!! Season's 1 and 2 in one great box set from Image!,"Classic fun for the whole family,this 5 DVD set contains 23 episodes 2 of which are ""lost"" shows never before released in sparkling DVD clarity! Now its available at a very low price! Get it before it goes out of print!"
5,My Own Personal Theme Park!,"I am a child of the 80's and am sooooo thrilled to be able to watch Pee Wee when I want for as long as I want. Of course I bought the DVD's and in a world of computers, cell phones and ipods, Pee Wee's Playhouse is the best way to escape to a magical, simpler time. It's like having my very own theme park right in the living room, and I'm staying and playing all day!"
3,More of the same.,"Yu Watase, Fushigi Yugi: Rival (ViZ, 2001)Installment five in the long-running, insanely popular manga finds the last of the Celestial Warriors of Suzaku, but Miaka barely notices; she's too busy waiting for Tamahome to fulfill his promise that he'd return once all seven celestial warriors are gathered. Now here's the problem: Miaka's best friend Yui is also smitten with Tamahome, and will do anything in her power to make Tamahome forget Miaka ever existed...more soap opera-esque fun from Yu Watase. She's come up with quite the roadblock this time, I have to say; if you're reading the series, no matter how slowly you're going, you'll rush out and buy volume six the second you finish this one, because it's that kind of cliffhanger. Which is naked emotional manipulation, of course, but then, that's what soap operas are all about, no?If you liked the first four, you'll like this one. ***"
3,So what?,"It's just badly spliced bits of sketches and songs from a stage show with fuzzy sound and inconsistent video quality. Worst rendition of ""The Lumberjack Song"" I've ever heard. Granted, some very funny bits, and nice live performances from Phil Collins, Pete Townshend, Bob Geldof, and Dame Edna, but not enough to make it worth owning. Rent it for some fun. If you feel guilty about ripping off Amnesty International (who received a portion of the movie's sales), send them a check."
4,"Intriguing book, good author, sad outcome!","This book was simply well written, interesting and a fantastic read! I had a hard time putting this book down. While I enjoyed the book I can't say that I enjoyed the fact that the writer put his opinion in his writing before the reader was able to make their own.This book hits hard at home if you have children and will make you think about the entire case whether you share the opinion of the writer or not is up to you. I think if I am to read another of Phelps' work I will do some background reading about the case first! Otherwise, enjoy this well written and amazingly shocking book!"
3,Typical Phelps,The story is interesting but once again Phelps had to drag it out so that it became excruciatingly painful to go from page to page. It was like reading court testimony 11600 pages of it. I still haven't finished it. I usually read five to six book at a time every couple of days but this one is taking a lot longer 2 weeks so far and hopefully I'll be done by the end of the month.I could keep going but then I would be pulling a Phelps.
4,Sad tale,The author does a good job of keeping the story interesting even during the trial section where I often lose interest. I read it because it is true but makes me sad for humanity.
4,a wedding present,"I was disapointed that the base was plastic, but my daughter and son-in-law are pleased with it."
2,Rest Of Uriah Heep,"Not as good as vol. 1. (really?). Some nice moments, but their worse stuff (pop, disco, mainstream). Okay , some hard rock."
3,buttons are a big problem,"Hi, I've been using this timer for about two years, and have been having problems with the buttons. They are very hard to push and get the desired numbers, or to stop. I end up holding and pressing buttons for 15-20 seconds!! I was surprised reading another review where buttons worked perfectly. Anyways, I am looking for a different timer. Otherwise it's a good timer with not annoying alarm and good size of numbers."
4,Ease of use is what we like,My wife is disabled and the ability to put minutes in by the tens as well as singles is a big bonus for her. It makes it much faster to enter times other than full hours.
5,Norman W. Walker great again,"The book is called Fresh Vegetable and Fruit Juices by Norman W. Walker does it again. This is the best book yet. This is the same as the Raw Vegetable Juice book by the Norman W. Walker, but in an update larger, letters and a little cheaper. This is the book everybody needs and I will always caring around to help other people get a new start on life. The best."
5,I absolutely LOVED this book!!!,"I am a huge Kimberly Cates fan - and this book has to rank as one of her best!! The romance between Ashleen and Garrett is so strong - you really believe these two belong together. Both characters have overcome so much, yet they are still strong and able to care about others. The kids and their relationship to each other and the adults was heartwarming. And the bad guys were REALLY BAD!! I would highly recommend this book as well as all her others."
2,Imagine Women Keely Hi-heel wedge sandal Not True Size,"Shoes were very stylist and just like the picture. They are of the same good quality of the Vince Camuto brand. I love them, just could not wear them. I did not return them because my daughter wears a size 8 in shoes and they fit her perfectly. The rating is low because the size runs too small. I always go up a size when ordering shoes online because you do not have the benefit of trying the shoes on. Going up a size did not work this time as the shoes were too small. There was no size in the shoes only the pull off sticker with the size on it under the bottom of the shoes. Just a mixup somewhere with the size. There's no way that size 10 shoes of this brand should fit a size 8. I buy the Camuto brand regularly and a size 9 fit great."
1,Internal battery has very short life,"I bought several of these Belkin 900VA UPS and had the same experience with all of them. For the first 6 - 8 months, the battery provides a pretty good amount of backup time before it dies (when the outside power fails). After 6 - 8 months, my battery has such little capacity left that it can run my one computer for less than 30 seconds before it dies. For a 900VA UPS, this number should be 15 minutes. Since I have three Belkin UPS units and they all degraded about the same rate, I am very disappointed. I won't buy any more UPS from Belkin. I also have an APC UPS, it degrades too over time too but its battery seems to last about 18 - 20 months."
2,DURO-MED REACH EXTENDER HIP KIT,THE SHOE HORN IS METAL IN THE PICTURE WHICH IS WHY I PURCHASED THE PRODUCT. IT IS HARD TO FIND A METAL SHOE HORN IN TOWN BUT WHEN THE PACKAGE ARRIVED IT CONTAINED A PLASTIC SHOE HORN. FALSE ADVERTISING AT ITS BEST.
2,cant play it,"I can't tell if this is for a gaming system or pc. Anyway it is an old edition, and I did not expect to be able to play it. Nostolgia again. But I was hoping to make it work."
1,dubious icon,"The dubious distinction that ""the captain"" has besides being a rabid nationalist, anti-semite, and murderer not to mention traitor to Romania is that he spawned modern Europe's first home grown ""suicide bombers"" so to speak; the suicide assisins of the Iron Guard, who gained cultic status within the orginization and as usual used church and state and culture to legitimize their hatred. A sad epoc for Romania, it's Orthodox Church and culture and a sad comentary, judging from the reviews that some people will always prefer delusion to the truth."
1,Bloodthirsty fascist,"For those deceived by the laudatory reviews of this book, Codreanu was a rabidly bigoted and violent founder of Romania's Iron Guard, which carried out assassinations of politicians and intellectuals and propagated vicious anti-Semitism during the interwar years, before going on to perform even more horrific deeds of brutality against Jews and others during the Second World War, following Codreanu's 1938 murder by Romanian authorities.Codreanu's book is doubtless useful as a primary source for those interested in learning about the mentality, rhetoric and propaganda style of Romanian fascism, just as Mein Kampf is a source of similar information about the Nazi movement. But to find inspiration in the writings of such a purveyor of political smut is another matter altogether."
1,not happy w/product or service,The product is an electric rechargeable airplane.On the first recharge after flight the on-off-recharge switch fell off. There was no response from the on line 24 hour help service.The phone customer service representative said if I paid shipping the company would send another plane. I agreed. That was over a month ago and still no new plane.
2,I love it.. to bad its broken already.,"I just got this plane two days ago for my birthday. I charged it up and flew it right away. I had a blast. I crashed alot, but it was still fun. The next day I try flying it and its rotor spins slowly and then turns off. I try it again and it doesn't turn on. I don't know what the problem is, but I'm quite disapointed. For 40 dollars you think you'd get a plane that would last longer than two days. I also didn't like how they put indoor plane. I noticed it could fly outdoors, and if crashing to much was the thing that broke it, it sure would of helped flying outdoors in wide open space. Not flying around vases and chairs in my living room."
4,R/C avion plane,Very easy to fly and works indoors and outdoors. Suitable for older teens and adults as if can be fragile.
1,Remote control broke in less than 10 minutes.,"Gave this product as a gift on Christmas. The remote control broke after playing with it for a few minutes - very disappointing, as we were looking forward to flying it. Extremely fragile plane, also."
4,Megatech Avion Airplane,"I bought it as a Christmas present for my 5-year old grandson, whose face literally lit up when he opened it. I don't know who's having more fun with it so far, my grandson or his dad! It's definitely kid-friendly but adults like it, too."
2,radio control,This thing is very light weight & fragile but the main issue I had with it was the range of the transmitter / controller. It only worked for aprox 10ft away. So not worth it. I would have rather spent another $25 or so & get something MUCH better. :o(
1,this is a piece of junk,"Bought this for my grandsons birthday, He got it on a Saturday and by Sunday the charger switch fell off along with some other piece and quit working, Not worth the money. Might as well go buy a cheap plane for a couple of bucks with the rubber band that winds up (I'm sure it would last longer)"
4,"What a fun, fun (indoor) blast!!!","The Avion biplane is a total blast to fly - either indoors in a *LARGE* room or outdoors ***AFTER SUNSET*** (that part is rather important!!!).It's very easy to fly (as R/C aircraft go), and durable enough to withstand crashes into lamps, couches, chairs, walls, etc. when you're learning to fly it. I say ""when"" because you very likely *WILL* crash while learning how to fly it.I also purchased the optional landing gear (wheels) that should allow it to take off without your having to hand-launch it; though I have honestly not had a chance to attempt a ""tabletop takeoff"" just yet.My full review of it (including four videos) can be found at the following URL: [...]This is my own website, [...] so I'm not just linking to another user's review here."
3,Large peanut filled bones for dogs,"My dogs loved the bones, however the bones that I purchased in the past at ""Pet Smart"" lasted much, much longer! For the price and shipping charge I could have spent the money more wisely. The bones that I bought in the past held their interest long after the peanut butter was gone and the ones I got from ""Redbarn"" don't seem to interest them any more and 1 of them was chewed down to the ""throw away"" size in a week.I won't be ordering these again and will look for another brand that is from the USA."
3,Just ok,The peanut butter is mixed with other stuff so it's all hard. Not sure what the ingredients are. The bone is all sterilized so other than the filling it's not an interesting treat.
3,Good product but dog lost interest,"After my dog could no longer get to the remaining filling in the center of the bone, he seemed to lose interest. However, the first few days he had it he wouldn't leave it alone. He still picks it up every once in a while but doesn't chew it very long."
2,Not a hit with my dog,My dog would not touch these. She wouldn't even go after the soft peanut butter. May be for a dog larger than a Maltese.
2,Filled Bone,"St Bernards didn't like it. They are the ones making the decision. They liked it as long as they could reah the peanut butter, about 10 minutes."
3,NOT TOO BAD MY DOG LIKES RAWHIDE,DOG PLAY WITH IT FOR AWHILE TRY IT IS A DEAL ALL DOG DIFFERENTONCE IS A GOOD DEAL TO TRY
2,don't buy,The bone was easy to break and also splintered into sharp pieces. We will not buy for our dog again.
1,Very dissapointing,"I was very excited to give this toy to my dog - he loves peanut butter. However, after only an hour with the bone he started to get very sick with diarrhea. We took the bone away but it continued well into the next day. There must be some strange additive in the peanut butter, since he's had regular peanut butter plenty of times before. He's always had a very strong digestive system. Very few things bother him, but I guess we found one of those things. I have nothing to do now but throw it away. Such a waste of money. Now I have a very sick dog and feel very guilty for being the one who gave it to him."
2,variable quality,we ordered one of these and our dog loved it - the peanut butter in the center was hard for her to get at and kept her occupied for weeks.she liked them so much we ordered a bunch more. we opened our first one today and she pushed the peanut butter out one end in under 30 seconds and ate it. so we paid for about 30 seconds of fun. really too bad.
4,Dogs love it,my two yellow labs love this bone as they cannot stop trying to get to the peanut butter. It is so funny watching them battle back and forth as to who gets the bone. They would practically devour this thing in a matter of minutes if we let them. We leave it for a treat.
3,One dog likes it one dog doesnt,like the title says one of my German shepherds likes it the other one doesn't. Its a very hard both almost feels like a hard plastic bone. My puppy loves it she carries it everywhere now wit that being said I have restricted that bone to her cage only that thing is so strong and heavy when she carries it around the house and drops it it could/will leave marks in floors. I have tile and wood floors and she dropped it on the tile one day and chipped a little of the tile. One dog likes it so thats all that matters probably wont buy again though I can't wait to see how she is going to get the filling out of the very middle.
2,Contains chicken!,"Why does this bone have to contain chicken meal and poultry flavor??? It's a PEANUT BUTTER bone. The reason I purchased it is because it was advertised as PEANUT BUTTER. My dog has a chicken sensitivity and would've gotten the runs like mad had I not read the label before giving it to him. Rather than return it because the shipping would've cost the same as what I paid for the item, I took the filling out and gave him the plain bone. I'll refill it with some regular Jiff if need be. It would've been helpful for the company to disclose the ingredients in these so-called peanut butter flavored things. Chicken is not peanut butter."
2,Thought this would have been a great find,"I was so excited when we got this in and even though i tend to only give my baby ""new"" treats, etc. when she is close to finishing one or gets tired of the one she's had i couldn't hold myself (i mean who doesn't LOVE peanut-butter??!!) and i gave it to her right out the box.Unfortunately this turned out to be such a disappointment! She sniffed it and that was all folks..For a 7 month old Labrador Retriever that says a lot to me because my baby can chew through anything. We got through toys almost on a daily bases and then all her chew bones and raw hides don't tend to last as too long either.She has chewed on it a few times but i think its because its been laying around for so long its just something else in the house. I'm not quite sure what the outside part is made of either because it does not seem to be real raw hide.I would definitely not buy again and will not recommend."
1,boycott made in China products,"I can't believe Amazon won't add where these products are made. After all the deaths of dogs this year with dog treats made in China, read about the deaths on msn, it's a sin to sell that posion to us and our pets. PLEASE Amazon state clearly where these items are made."
1,PRICE?,"The list price can not be right. I have looked online at other sites and have never seen it priced that much. Found it actually for the price it is selling for. WEIRD Might be a good product, but sneaky selling tacticts."
4,Exposing copyright bullies,"I've recently begun reading up on the subject of corporate efforts to take control of our culture,. While the material here may be familiar turf to many , it was eye opening to me. I had no idea that copyright law had been distorted and bent against the interests of those it was meant to serve: the public (for it's a bargain between the creator and the public, not simply a property right interest, as many people commonly assume).Bollier's book brings these issues to light in an entertaining, enlightening way. Imagine, ASCAP going after the girl scouts for singing songs around the campfire! Imagine charging royalties for croonng ""Happy birthday"" at a public event.If you're not familiar with these issues, ""Brand Name Bullies"" is a good primer. Read up, get educated, get mad, then fight back!"
4,My Opinion (C) (R) tm,"The topic of this book is incredible. Hard to beleive it's gone this far. It boggles the mind.That said, I found large parts of the book to be repetitive, and didn't really give enough background/details on the various examples. I would have liked some more finger pointing, but as it stands, I'll boycott Ralph Lauren-Polo for being a putz about the name!Recommended reading, but wish the writing was a bit better."
4,'humor and horror juxtaposed',"Lovely book that can only be described as the literary equivalent of naive art! Comyns recounts episodes from her childhood, brought up in a genteel if debt-laden family. It put me in mind of Nancy Mitford's account of her own family. Irascible Daddy, vague, deaf Mammy and six children who for want of outside company spend much time together.Comyns writes in a unique childlike style with eccentric spelling and an antipathy for semicolons, so that phrases run into each other.Far from being a sentimental account, Comyns recalls the horrific alongside the magical- villagers are drowned in the flood, Daddy has violent tempers, animals get ill-treated- yet with a childlike acceptance.I LOVE Comyns' work!"
3,Not Great For Necks,The neck portion of this product does not come up high enough to provide any neck pain relief. It is also very heavy.I think it probably would be useful for back pain relief.
3,Probably much more comfortable for men than women,I got this for warmth on my back and it is OK but not great. When heating in the microwave on must fold it this way and that to fit it in and this tends to result in some hot spots and some areas that don't get warmed enough. The strap across the chest is in just the wrong position for women and so you have to choose to have it either too high or too low. It also would be much better if the buckle was not all the way off to the side but centered.
2,Not a good cold-pack,"Makes a very poor cold pack. I don't know if that's typical for this Elasto-Gel material, but contrary to what's claimed for this product, it quickly warms to just cool within 5-10 minutes after taking it out of the freezer."
3,good,"I liked it, and works as for I bought it. The only thing is that you have to beware of the fabric cover, heat it very carefully, and DO NOT FORGET to clean the micro before you put it in. I may be wrong, but thought I read it was washable, but you cannot take of the cover. So, try to wash it with mild soap, and this, and that... a bit complicated"
3,helps but attachment system needs attention,"I bought this product because I have chronic pain and icing helps. The whole back pad helps a great deal. I like to lean back against the product, but the attachments don't work very well."
1,NOT fragrance free,"I bought this thinking that ""Hypoallergenic no harsh fragrances"" meant that it didn't have, well, harsh fragrances. Wrong. It contains one of the harsher fragrance chemicals ""Parfum"" to which I am allergic. So I now have four gallons of soap that causes a rash on my skin. I consider this false advertising."
2,BIG-BUTTON SPKRPHONE,"As a speakerphone, the amplifier is not powerful enough to be heard.Max adjustment still requires the person to put his ear right near the phone in arder to hear anything.I would not buy it as a speakerphone."
3,Not what I thought it would be.,"The scale has 999 preset food items, many of which I'll never use and it does not have many of the foods that I do need. One example, fresh shrimp is not in the presets, but canned shrimp is?!? Does anyone really eat canned shrimp? There are no directions on how to change the presets, if that is even possible, which I assume is not since it doesn't give any instructions on how to change them. It falls way short of what I thought it would do."
3,This is a really old book people...,"This book was bought by my parents in the 1980's. Though it probably was more complete when it was printed, it's really old. There has been numerous revisions and reprints to it...now called Tokyo City Atlas by the same publisher, Kodansha. I don't know why its still for sale when 4 new revisions and 20 to 30 years have come and gone..."
4,Great Maps but be careful...,"I currently am in Tokyo and have been for 3 months and have use used this map book extensively throughout the Metro area. I happen to have the first edition (1993) that I bought in the US. I have tried to see if this book has been updated but Amazon.com is unclear about this - leading me to believe it has i in fact, not been updated. There are entire trains and subway lines not listed because they are new since 93. I was on the tiny Tamagawa line yesterday and two of the station names have been changed! Seems like some residents didn't like living means in front of a cemetary (Tamabochi-mae). Other than the old edition this is a great map book , especially for the essential area of train/subway travel. domo."
4,How to wrong-foot casual listeners,"Sydney-based Leonardo's Bride wrong-footed its casual listeners with this first taste of their new album, 'Open Sesame'.Well known for producing beautiful, slow acoustic ballads as single releases, 'Sonic' is about as different as you can get.Fast paced, loads of electric guitar and a memorable -- albeit nonsense -- lyric culminating in singer Abby Dobson asking the listener, ""Can I be sonic too? "" the song is a cute pop number, played by a real working band, nothing more, nothing less.Of the song itself, guitarist Dean Manning says: ""Sonic I liken to arriving at a party very drunk. But it's OK 'cause there's friends there,"" while singer Abby says ""It's great fun; I love it. It's the only song we play that you could vaguely consider moshing to.""The hidden gems, as always, lurk on the band's b-sides. Neither of these two tracks are on the CD, and are well worth buying the single for... but only if you're in the habit of listening to b-sides."
3,"these are ok, not the best I have had","some dirt from time to time. a few rotten bags too, moldy. I would not buy this brand again. I never believe the organic lables if it is south of the border or from overseas, and this is no exception. Probalby not safe to eat for small children."
3,Its okay,"I really wanted a dimmer for the bathroom light for bath time, and this seemed great when we decided to go with push-buttons. What I don't like is that side by side with another push button, the top button sticks out about 1/4"" further than the other buttons. As it shares a box with a standard push button, this is quite noticeable.Installed, it also pushes out the light switch cover. Also, we had to drill out the hole on the light switch cover to get the top button to fit because its has a slightly larger diameter.So, if you absolutely must have a dimmer, this will do, but it is certainly not perfect."
5,Book Review,"A must read book for US sharpshooter enthusiasts and reenactors. The book is a first hand account of soldier's lives and the battles involving the Berdan's regiments. Nothing is more intriguing to me, than reading the words of one who was there."
4,An Overall Good Book,"This book was a very good one. It was about a little girl named June Cameron growing up along the B.C. coast. Her discriptions of the area are extremely well written, considering i am her grandaughter and visit the area she grew up in every year. This might not be a good chapter book for younger children, because it is a little hard to read. However, the book is filled with interesting facts and bits of humor."
4,Worth it for the last 14-15 Tracks,"I'm not crazy about the first 13 tracks, but tracks 14-28 are wonderful. Definitely worth buying, if you can swing a good discount in the used category. Exquisite baroque."
4,"Great Recording, but","At first, I have to say I cannot measure Eiji Oue's thought with my own scale. But I have to inform the reason I rate this CD 4 stars inspite all reviewers give 5 stars.When you start listening, I promise you can find this recording exceptional of all you've listened. It successfully pulls out an attraction that Respighi's works originally possess. As everyone wrote on his review, sound is clear, gorgeous and dynamic. I basically agree with all those comments. It is true the sound is supurb and I was completely knocked down by ""The Pines of Rome,"" but still cannot get involved fully in both ""Belkis"" and ""Dance of the Gnomes."" What's wrong? In my opinion, Eiji Oue might be bound by Respighi's sound itself. Although he had to choose the best way, I think, so that the sound could be re-constructed completely, he failed at the same time to give the wilderness which ""Belkis"" and ""Gnomes"" should have originally. These are too smart for me."
2,poorly assembled,"While I have no complaint about the contents of this order, half of the purpose for paying so much for some tea and trinkets is the arrangement. This item arrived looking like it was simply tossed together as an afterthought. The appeal of sending a gift basket is that it is supposed to look pretty (like the image). If the vendor can't take the time to properly arrange a gift basket, especially if I paid extra for wrapping on top of the cost of the basket itself, I would be hesitant to order such an item from amazon in the future. Might I suggest using FTD or your local florist..."
1,Vast Disappointment,"I am a rabid lifelong fan of Patton, Dunn, Secret Chiefs 3, Zorn, etc. So I looked forward to this album with great anticipation.Instead to my horror I found the most unbearable CD I have ever encountered. I am incredulous that the great Trevor Dunn could produce such uninspired crap. Why he hooked up with the world's most annoying guitar player and such a horrendous drummer I'll never understand. This is quite literally the worst CD I own in 30+ years of collecting. I rather listen beat my head against a wall, or be forced to listen to Yoko Ono or Phil Collins (!!!)than ever suffer through this garbage again. Please don't even fart in the general direction of this CD...it really is THAT bad. :("
4,Another quality release from Trevor Dunn,"This album is an instrumental fusion of jazz, metal, and rock. Trevor Dunn's skills as a bassist and composer continue to impress, and the chemistry between him and his trio is electric. Listening to this album, I was reminded of Naked City, Fima Ephron, and Mr. Bungle's Disco Volante (well, the Trevor Dunn tracks, especially ""Carry Stress in the Jaw""). I would recommend this album to any fans of the previously mentioned artists, as well as anyone interested in contemporary avant-garde jazz."
2,Thrazzy shortcomings,"2 1/2SPOF has its moments of asymmetrical thrash jazz-metal glee, and a few songs hint at the fantastic work this fractured bassist can provide with a little conscious refinement, but for the most part this Bungle-boy continues to indulge in too much style with not enough substance, articulated by constant overuse of scraggly guitar lines which serve only to provide pseudo-edge to deflated momentum."
5,Great Shoes,"These shoes are comfortable, stylish, and extremely well-made.I plan to order them in other colors, and know they will last a long time."
1,Not worth the paper it's printed on,"This ""study guide"" is worthless and a complete waste of time. It is full of inaccurate & seriously outdated information as well as blatent contradictions. I took the DANTES exam in May 2002 and the information in this book is not even remotely representative of what is on the exam."
2,Meh... Not for the price,I like the looks but the cover feels like it may fall apart if I ever need to wash it. I would buy it for a guest room for ~$39 but can't give it a good rating compared to similarly priced Duvets.
5,You will NOT be disappointed!!!,This duvet is FABULOUS. It is SO SOFT. The colors are beautiful and exactly as shown. I am highly impressed with this duvet - especially for the price.
4,Great Duvet set,"I was a little skeptical about a microsuede duvet cover. When the set arrived, i was pleasantly surprised. it looks nice and fits our oversized down comforter perfectly....now if i can just figure out how to keep the darn comforter in place, i'd be happy, but that is not because of the duvet. The set matches very nicely with our furniture and is super comfy too. I have matched it with gold sheets and then chocolate....Not the cafe color that was recommended, it's too orangey for the camel shade of tan. I was super happy with this set for the price, i couldn't pass it up.. Now i am just waiting for my matching curtains to arrive."
2,Too Hot For Summer!,"Both my wife and I are very uncomfortable using this duvet cover set. It causes us to sweat and we spend more time adjusting the duvet and pillows than we do sleeping. To be fair, if you're interested in saving energy this winter, by all means jump in!"
3,wow,i would not have read it if i knew there was a part two that she never worked on. s***maybe i should write part two. how u promise a release date then dont give your fans what they hoping for?
4,Good Read,This was a pretty good read. Had me interested. I don't like how it ended. I need a part 2.
4,Good but could have been better!,"This story was a great romance with some drama thrown in. Blossom and Dude's relationship took off from the beginning of the book. I would have loved for Queen Pen to elaborate more on the physical relationship, expecially with her being a virgin and all. I really hope part II tells more of this exciting tale also what happens with Kandi and Darlene and Black. I can't wait!!!"
5,need a sequel now,"Okay I'm a little late to the party but I finally made it.Just finished reading this today and I'm blownaway! This was an amazing read,the characters just jumped off the pages at the. I was so hurt about what Dude did to Blossom and Maria, he doesn't deserve either of them. I can't believe how she flipped the script and on her wedding day of all days. I can't wait for a sequel this was a five star for me!"
3,"SURPRISE, SURPRISE...","I guess you CAN separte the different artistry and talents of artists. I NEVER have been a fan of queen pen's music career (or lack there of) but I know am a fan of her work as an author. A friend of mines reccommended this book and if she didn't I would've never thought twice to read it. This book had both predictable and unpredictable parts to it. I love how it ended. I hope theres a part two to this strong, young, determined sister Blossom who have endured so much pain and agony that it's unspeakable. This would make a great sequel."
4,All Hail The Queen! 4.5 stars,"I was actually shocked it was so good! This is a True Ghetto Fairytale indeed! I kept second guessing reading this one because she's a rapper, Now I have read rapper autobio's but fiction? Boy was I sleepin on this one! This was one of the best books I read in '06! I would of gave it a 5 if she wouldn't of left room for a part two :0) Which I'am bitting my nails waiting for! If you haven't gave this book a try...what are you waiting for?"
3,Days of Our Lives....,"This book reads like a soap opera....which is not really a bad thing...no real depth here....but, it's entertaining and that's what I bought if for....also left plenty much room for a sequel...just like friday on a soap opera...."
5,In Full Bloom,"This novel was written with the excellent pen of the urban world. Queen told this story as if she were one of the many young women who had dreams of living in the lap of luxury but, also didn't want to feel the shame of compromising themselves to have such a lfe. I really fell in love with the character Blossom. She was a strong young lady and she in the end was able to walk away with her head held high. I am hoping that there is a sequel to ""Blossom"", to see how she fared after leaving all the other crabs in the barrel snapping at her feet!!!! Big ups to Queen Pen, this one is a winner.Peace and BlessingsQawiyah"
5,The greates,I loved Blossom because it was so real! Her man blew up but so did their relationship and everyhing else. This was the best book ever I reccomend it for anyone!
4,I was surprised,I was surprised that I really liked this book. I can not wait for the sequel. I gave it 4 stars only because I did not know it part1 or I would have waited until the second book came to buy this one. But I like it just the same. Good read for those who like urban books.
2,Blossom,This book was alright although I felt it had some unrealistic parts. It was a decent read I must say the end was not what I expected and I felt like Blossom herself was playing games herself. So her sister actions were not really worth all that it was made out to be. I really would had liked her to finish this story with this book. Dont feel like a part 2 was necessary. She is a good writer her first book was very good and much more realistic. Now I would like her to bring part 2 of the story she left to continue from her first book. Truly can wait for part 2 of this one.
5,A Hitt,"A great read from the jump, read the book in a day. I can't wait for the Sequel. Blossom, her sister and rest of her friends were like real everyday people. Loved the book...."
2,Who is the rapper,The CD has some good songs thats the only reason I give it two stars. the rapper or DJ(and I'm thinking this is the same guy on some of the other tracks) as some would call him is trying too hard to sound caribbean so he sounds fake. especially the first track come on now. maybe if he just did it normal and not try so hard to have a caribbean accent it would have been better.
1,Waste,This was a waste of money. It's like reading an english teacher's lecture and who wants to do that? I don't. If you have to get this for a class. I wouldn't waste your money.
5,"If you love country, you have to have this","I am not a Country Home magazine subscriber (although this book suggests that I ought to become one), but I first saw this book at a book store where I sat down and went through it page by page. An hour later, I realized that I was still sitting there not wanting to put the book down, so I ordered it from amazon (better price). The book is is a large size with lovely heavy paper and gorgeous BIG photos showing a variety of current country looks (romantic, modern, traditional). This is one of the prettiest and most inspiring books I have seen in a long time. Highly recommend."
2,THE GREAT BOOKSEARCH FOR THE CLASSICAL ORDERS OF ARCHITECTUR,"This semi demi-short story starts out ..... I was swimming in a virtual sea of t-squares, triangles, and circular templates. A voice from somewhere far off shouts in a very soft and calm voice: ""THE CLASSICAL ORDERS OF ARCHITECTURE"". Or something like that, becasuse even though mumbling is the same in all languages, I am not certain those are the exact words that were spoken. The voice was so...bombardic? . Slowly subliminal assurity whispers bombastically that the words spoke of a book title and that I must find it yet. Although to my utter and true amazement no visual discription accompanies this sageistic soliliquis.And so in the stead of a ""review"" I submit for your perusal an e-based effort: To whom it may concern. While your website is absolutely fantastic it is surely lacking in one blatantly subtle area.....Where are the pictures of the ""BOOKCOVERS""?Just one man's answer to perhaps an unasked question.Regards,Papastein"
2,Asynchronous Circuit Theory?,"I'm actually pretty disappointed in the book. I was hoping for asynchronous circuits. A better title for the book would be ""Asynchronous Circuit Theory"". The book is more of an Ivory Tower book that describes theory, with not as much practical information as would be hoped. The VHDL examples in the back are so completely removed from what could ever be synthesized, that they're useless from an HDL standpoint. It would even be helpful if he gave us an idea of what simulator could actually simulate his VHDL, because none of mine could. And without any comments or descriptions of the code, I couldn't even figure out what he was trying to do to make it work.However. If you want to be caught up in the latest asynchronous theory, this book is excellent. It uses a very simple ""wine shop"" paradigm throughout the book to help the reader understand each new principle."
5,LTL on circuit,"This book is good to start the asynchronous circuit and to verify linear time temporal logic(LTL).This book show the circuit by the VHDL.The title should be ""Asynchronous Circuit Design Concept, Description with VHDL and Verification with LTL."""
3,"Not the best Disch on the table, but tasty in its own way...","Disch takes us through the lives of several people living at 334 11th Street, an apartment complex contolled by MODICOM; a modern day welfare system of social case workers.The time frame jumps between 2020 and 2026, and especially in Part III the time frames jump from chapter to chapter, even with the same characters. It got a little frustrating when something would happen to one of them, and suddenly you are back in a time frame with this same character that you read about already, 50 pages ago. Some of Disch's characters are fully formed and multi-dimensional, but unfortunatly those are not the ones we get to see the most of.Mainly, the story follows the Hansen's and the people they know and come in contact with in 334. Despite not being the best story Disch has written, the prose and poetry of his writing is still very much present, and at only 250 pages this is still a good addition to your reading pile."
4,A well-observed sci-fi book..,"I really enjoyed this book. Even tough sometimes pretentious, this book is really vivid in the description of the desperate lives of a bunch of humans in the future..."
2,bleh,"This is the book that made me decide I would never ever recommend a book to someone without reading it first myself. Whatever literary value 334 might have, I found it to be a painful unenjoyable read."
1,334,"One keeps bouncing off nebulous plot lines. Inimical to the reader, it is like scaling the perpetual slippery slope.Thomas Disch's use of historical retrospectives obfuscates the message here.This work was better left as a collection of personal cameos of the destitute characters written in short story format. This work has no claim to higher level fiction.Finishing this should be rewarded with a money back guarantee."
5,"An unsettling, and moving experience.","This is a totally convincing book about life in the inner city of New York, 2020's. The story follows the lives of several characters, many who live in bldg. 334, a large multi-family government subsidized housing project. Technology has marched ever onward, and the need for unskilled labor has largely disappeared. Yet, with all of the advances, the poor, uneducated and misfortunates live largely unnoticed. They are assisted only by some innefective social programs. The people of 334 fight continual battles for hope, respect and a place among a society that has largely left them behind. The book doesn't attempt to place blame, or offer solutions, but proceeds only with the full reality of the setting. The characters, and the readers, are left to sort it all out. This is a challenging, serious book for serious readers of any genre."
4,334,"The book 334 is a journey into the future, where babies are grown in bottles and promiscuity is no longer ""promiscuous."" But it is also liquid: the scenes and years jump back and forth, and it can be hard to keep track of. I thought this book was very developed; the character of the different mini-stories were all connected in different ways, and the plots shared similar themes. It was very entertaining to read, and it really made me think about what the world will be like if society continues on the path it is currently on. Thomas Disch wrote this book in the seventies, but it still seems like a plausible scenario for the future (unlike 1984 must have seemed in the sixties), though perhaps not quite as early as Disch envisioned. All in all, I think it is a very entertaining and enlightening book."
3,3.5 Stars,"Pretty Good, just I wonder why wasnt he more advertised, I never heard of him and I was in this store 1 day and bought it for a dollar and it turned out to be pretty good....He is a good singer and has pretty good production"
1,I know this is only fiction BUT....,"I have never, ever seen a more doormat of a character than Christobel. The hero of this book, Judd, treats poor Chrissy terribly throughout the entire book and yet she just takes his emotional abuse with love. I wanted her to realize that she could divorce Judd and have a happier life. I don't know what I found more offensive: the emerald ""engagement"" ring Judd buys Tippy or Judd forgetting Chrissy's 21st b-day while out at a party with Tippy. I was almost hoping somebody would shoot Judd because he was that awful."
3,"Cupcakes, anyone?","I recently reviewed Cattleman's Pride and lamented that I had only to wait until page 98 for the leading man to say ""In fact,"" he bit off against her lips, ""neither are you, cupcake."" I got my cupcake on page 23 of Lawless: ""About as much as you do, cupcake,"" he mused. My friends in Texas assure me that they don't call their girlfriends cupcake. Please, Ms. Palmer, drop the overused endearment.The author does her best work with full length novels, so, ""cupcake"" aside, this is not a bad book. The storyline was typical: strong older man and the virginal young woman, with some speed bumps tossed in for interest. Personally, I thought that Judd was a dud and Chrissy would have done better with Cash Grier. Tippy was so bitchy throughout that it defied belief that everyone was able to ""make nice"" with her at the end of the book.If you need a few hours of escape, you could do worse."
2,"Shallow, cliche and at times, utterly ridiculous!",This is what I'd call a shallow read. The reader doesn't have to use their brain much. The author tells you everything that's going to happen right before ti happens. The drama and misunderstandings are so drawn out. This is the first and only book I'll read from this author.
5,The best!!!,I just got done reading this book and I loved it. I couldn't put it down. It is truely a great love story. I haven't read any other Palmer books but I'm definelty looking for another one by Palmer-
4,Humorous,"I've read almost all of Ms. Palmers books. Some have been cheesy and some have been repetitive, but this one, well, I really enjoyed it.It was FUNNY. There were several good lines and I laughed aloud quite a few times. It was only about 3/4 of the way thru the book that it got a little cheesy, but the earlier humor made up for that.One of Palmers best - in a long time...."
4,Great DP Read,"I am new to DP, but have read several in the past 2 months. This was one of her longer books, but still went at a quick pace. I enjoyed the joking nature of Christabel as well as the fact that she was not at all shy about her attraction to Judd and her desire to sleep with him. Even though she was inexperienced, she knew what she wanted! Sparks flew between Judd and Crissy and they didn't hold back during their love scenes. Very passionate! This is a book in which you will become very emotionally involved with the characters. It seemed to evoke more emotion to me than some of her other books. Great DP read!"
5,Lots of emotions...,I loved it! Definitely made me feel a lot of emotions. That to me is a good story.
2,"There, But Not There","I ordered this brush for a friend of mine that has mobility issues. They wanted to be able to clean throughly when they showered. However, according to them, the brush handle bends way to easy and the sponge is to thick. The length of the handle is wonderful, IF it was made from a stronger material."
1,Cheap sponge and construction,"Unlike product description, the handle cannot be bent to reach all back areas. The handle is cheap plastic that will break if attempting to bend it.Not worth the price."
4,Turn up the volume,"Sony's newest style is visually stunning with lots of cool features, but..... the speakers suck. They are way too quiet and they don't have any bass or treble control. Since they market it as a computer/tv, you would think that they would put a decent sound system in it. Luckily, I have been able to hook up an external set of speakers to it, but it takes away from the sleekness and versatility of the computer. It also comes preinstalled with way to much junk software, and no operating system cd's for reformatting.Given that, I would still buy it because it's fresh new style. The computer itself is really thin and the screen is really nice. It is cool to look at web pages in widescreen format. I would suggest to buy it, but only if you are ok with adding external speakers."
3,Good Power Metal CD,"Forget the history lesson here most everyone knows about this band.I like this album. Songs are very catchy and have power. Not all the songs are good but most are, making This power Metal Album worth the money.I am into 80's metal and it has that feel to it.Vocals and music are excellent.Out of all the Helloween Albums this CD and Keeper...Keys {though this album is not the classic as Keeper was} still get play time.I would suggest this a must buy for Helloween and Power metal fan alike."
1,80's rock continuing into the new era...,"I first heard of Helloween back in the early 90's in Japan of all places. They were a big rock band over there but I had never heard of them in the US. It was basically another glamor rock band of the 80's. Fast forward to current times and this music is just out dated, still trying to push the 80's music style 'Butt Rock' back into 2001. If your a big fan of 80's rock then get the classics like: Quiet Riot, Def Leppard, Scorpions, Guns and Roses ect. ""you get the idea"". I just don't see this band doing anything special today that would excel them to the old classics of 80's Rock...."
5,Let me tell you something...,"... ""Master of the Rings"" is THE comback of Helloween! There are a few bands who managed to make it back with a new singer, and Helloween is one of them. ""Master"" is the first album featuring Andi Deris (ex-Pink Cream 69), who stepped in after Michael Kiske took off in 1993. Obviously Helloween put a lot on this album and if it would fail, the band probably wouldn't exist now. But fortunately, the material of the CD is a total blast from the first notes of the ""Irritation"" to the last chords of ""Still We Go"".And another good thing about this album is that Deris is not trying to repeat Kiske (which is simply impossible anyway), but does his own thing and does it very profesionally.Very fresh, very funny, very multisided. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED and a MUST for Melodic Metal fans!"
3,Solid Effort,"This is a pretty typical album we'd come to expect from Helloween. It is very heavy through most of the album's tracks with pristine operatic vocals from a new singer. It thrashes like mad. Key tracks are: Soul Survivor, Where the Rain Grows, Mr. Ego, Secret Alibi and Still We Go. If you're not familiar with Helloween, they are a German power metal band since the 1980s, I wanna say German's second biggest metal act behind Scorpions. Pro wrestler Chris Jericho takes his ""Walls of Jericho"" finisher from one of Helloween's early albums. They are elite. I would recommend this if for nothing else than to fill your collection."
4,"A real mix, from traditional to pop","I like this CD very much, with the exception of, I think, 2 tracks. One problem with the CD (for me) is that it is a huge mix of styles, so while there is something for everyone, there probably aren't many people who will love all of it. However, it is all exceptionally well done. I actually prefer listening to the video with the video turned off because the rhythmic pounding of the tap/step dancing isn't part of the CD (or at least not the recording I have -- I have an early British release that only has half the tunes of this version. I gather it is an evolving product.)"
5,Echoes of infinity,"The Celts are one of the Old Peoples. Like Indian ragas, North American and !San chants and rhythms, the aching melodies of Celtic music reach out into the spaces behind the stars. Riverdance invites us to feel the resonance, the poignant and the exciting - and it's bloody good fun, too, lest we wax too philosophical! No collection is complete without it."
4,"Emotional, eclectic, exhilirating - excellent!","Bill Whelan has, in this critic's opinion, captured the Irish spirit in song. The instrumentals are comforting, yet at the same time, awe-inspiring. The vocals touch your heart in a way that it perhaps has not been touched in a very long time, if ever. If you think you will never enjoy the Irish-style of music, try this one - it may very well change your mind forever!"
4,Mixed feelings,"I watched Riverdance on PBS,,, loved it live! This is a studio remix without the performance feel. The dancing is almost non-existent, but the music is dead on. Make sure the music is what you wanted,,, otherwise you'll be disappointed. Still a great grouping of Irish music. There is no song more evocative or haunting than ""Caoineadh Cu Chulainn (Lament)"", performed by Davy Spillane on Uilleann Pipes. It always makes a chill go up my spine."
2,Not quite the real soundtrack,"I am disappointed and a bit upset. This is NOT a soundtrack. The music of Riverdance IS wonderful! I have a tape that is several years old and wanted a CD since I never get tired of this soundtrack. But I was very disappointed. The soundtrack of Riverdance includes the sounds of the dancers when they are ""clogging."" This is very much a part of this music. The first track includes the dancing, but none of the others. I was very disappointed that this CD is not as I expected it to be. The music is still good, but an important part of it is most definitely missing. :~("
5,Getting started in bonds,The book is very thorough and easy to understand. I gave it to someone interested in learning about the subject and he found it the perfect introduction to the subject.
3,So-so,"This book contains some good information, but could have been better organized. Technical terms, for instance, are used before they are defined. While not terrible, it's certainly not great either."
2,An example of how NOT to write a book,"I picked up this book at the library hoping to learn a little more about bonds. Unfortunately, this book is poorly organized and doesn't spend enough time introducing the basics of bonds. It has some helpful pictures, but I couldn't make it past the first 50 pages before I gave up. I borrowed ""All About Bonds, Bond Mutual Funds, and Bond ETFs, 3rd Edition"" and this is much clearer to me."
2,Possible remedy for the scroll wheel problem,"It appears that the following steps may remedy the scroll wheel problem:1. Turn on your computer with the USB receiver plugged in.2. Once your computer has booted up, remove the batteries from your mouse.3. Re-insert your batteries.The scroll wheel should work normally now.I know the above may sound silly, but I have tried it on two separate mouse and they worked (for me)."
1,"lousy: hard to scroll, no way to power off","I've used Microsoft mice in the past and they've been great, but this one is terrible.The good: it's shape and size are good, it's precise and it came with 2 alkaline batteries (AA).The bad: scroll wheel is difficult to turn because the click indents are too big. You tend to accidentally click it instead because you have to press down a bit to get enough grip to turn the wheel. And there's no way to turn the mouse off except by removing the batteries, and the batteries are not easy to take out. Poor design."
3,"OK, but not great...","The mouse works great as long as you don't use the scroll button. You have to scroll very slow, and it still skips. Everything else about it is very good."
2,terrible scroll wheel,"If you use (or want to use) the scroll wheel, don't buy this mouse.The general shape and design is good. Reasonably comfortable and usable for left and right handers.The signal range is poor. If I put the receiver on the other side of my small desk, movement is erratic. You really need to have it within a foot or two.The scroll wheel is terrible. You feel a click every time you scroll the wheel up or down, but every third or forth click isn't registered on the computer. Using the scroll wheel as a middle mouse button is also terrible. When I try to use it to middle click on a link inside my web browser to open the page in a new tab, it sometimes scrolls the page up or down instead of registering the click. I don't have this problem with other mice, so I suspect it's related to the problem with the scrolling.Many others here have the same problems. I can't recommend this mouse."
2,Unresponsive,The mouse becomes unresponsive for about 30 seconds a few times a day. I have since added it to my electronics time capsule.
2,"fine mechanics, frustrating shape for large hands","I have found this mouse to be just fine for desktop use, it is roughly the same size as the standard Microsoft wired mice. Sadly, it seems to suffer from a common mouse design flaw: the sides of the mouse slope outward, so that while gripping the mouse and moving, it constantly feels like it's slipping out of your hand. This is exacerbated by the weight: naturally, wireless mice are heavier than wired mice by dint of their need to include a battery.I've normally avoided all such mice because of this frustrating feeling, but I got this one for just $10 including shipping from Overstock. Sadly, though, it seems that we get what we pay for."
2,Low Quality Wireless Mouse,"I usually like Microsoft hardware, but this mouse was a piece of junk. The scroll wheel didn't scroll smoothly, as other reviews have pointed out, but my biggest problem with it was that the pointer jumped all over the screen and often just moved slowly to the top of the screen.The receiver was really close to the mouse, so that wasn't the problem. I think if you want the convenience of a wireless optical mouse you just need to spend a little more dough."
2,This mouse is a dog!,"Good design.My optical mouse 2.0 will connect to the ps2 port with a usb to ps2 adapter. Not this one. You must connect it to a usb port. The instructions don't say that. The instructions don't say much at all. And they shouldn't. Installing a mouse should take more the the time it takes to connect it. You shouldn't have to search the web for help. How long should I press the buttons on the receiver and mouse. What am I looking for. The 2000 receive has no light like the 2.0. Anyway, I finally got the thing to work and I hate it. Like many other reviewer, I agree the the wheel isnt' as smooth or reactive as it should be. Microsoft is very impressed with themselves that they've include 6+ month batteries. It's on the box at least 6 times. To you and me, that 2 Engergizer AA's. WOW!.The mouse does work but not as well as 100 others in the same price range. Shop around."
1,$40 Down the Drain,"If we hadn't tossed the receipt away, I'd be taking this product back to the store. If my husband is using his computer (with a different brand mouse), my curser moves all over the screen and clicks on random things. Basically, I am unable to use it at all when my husband is on his PC. If there is a way to change the frequency, I haven't found it. Attempted to contact the Microsoft support, but can't find a product ID on the mouse. The only number there is not the right format.I guess I'll give this expensive garbage to one of my kids and stick with Logitech."
1,Worst mouse I've ever owned,"I have had 32 mice, wired and wireless in the past 10 years. Do not buy this one, it is by far the worst mouse I have ever owned. I had one last year I threw away, and this is not worth returning. YOU WERE WARNED!!!"
2,Worst mouse I have owned in a while,"This is by far the worst mouse I have ever owned or used in the past 15 years. Horribly inaccurate and sticks to surfaces (as opposed to glides). The wheel skips like crazy and forget about using the middle (wheel) button. The reason I am rating it 2 stars instead of ZERO star is because battery life is good, but that's about it."
2,Doesn't work very well,"The scroll wheel does not work properly, it intermittenly refuses to scroll instead often goes to the ""automatic scroll"" mode and scroll the screen to end of the page. Also it often won't work after I click on it to get me to certain site."
1,non functioning scroll wheel,"I'm on my second one. Have the same problem with the scroll wheel, works initially then quits. Removing and reinstalling batteries fixs it, but you have to do this everytime you reboot. About to feed it to the cat!"
3,Scroll Wheel problems,"I had the same problem but took the advice that someone else posted about switching the system on then taking the batteries out of the mouse then putting them back in and it worked, solved all the problems just as i was about to return the mouse as broken."
1,Batteries!,Don't buy this product. I've been through 10 sets of batteries in 6 months. The only way to turn it off is take the batteries out - if you remember!!. Tried to contact microsoft online but their system doesn't recognise the PID and they want my credit card details before I can submit a query. For some reason the option in Settings to 'Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power' is disabled. Microsoft should recall all these and replace FOC and whoever designed it shot!Peter
2,Scroll wheel is terrible,"So the fix someone suggested for the scroll wheel seems to work (removing and reinserting the batteries with the pc turned on), but the fact that that needs to be done and the feel/movement of the scroll wheel makes this mouse rather undesirable. I've got it for free at work, but I'd never buy one myself."
2,Unresponsive scroll wheel,"I had to take this mouse back because the scroll wheel was too unresponsive. I liked everything else, but the horrible scroll wheel was a deal breaker."
2,What a terrible mouse.,"This mouse is really bad. There is almost nothing good about it, only the size and battery life are good.CONS:- Absolutely terrible scroll wheel. It makes a really loud plastic-sounding click noise, and the intervals are really big so you end up scrolling down 6 inches of the page when you only want to scroll down maybe two.- The entire thing just feels fake, all plastic like and hollow.- It constantly registers double clicks when you only click once.- All of the clicking mechanics sound hollow.- The mouse never turns off! The only way you can turn it off is by taking both of the batteries out, which isn't too easy.Overall I do not think this was a good investment, so I am buying a new mouse. Unfortunately I bought this mouse as a package with the Microsoft Wireless Keyboard 1000, which is pretty good, so I cannot return it."
2,Microsoft Keyboard and Mouse 2000,"The keyboard is great. It feels solid and has most of the features anyone would want. I love it!But the mouse is the worst thing I've ever used! The main problem is that the scroll wheel is intermittent. But the resolution is also poor. It doesn't seem to be a product that you would expect in the 21st century.However, I took another reviewer's advice and removed the batteries from the mouse after the computer had booted, and reinstalled them. The scroll wheel now works much better. It's still not great, but it's more or less usable. Many thanks goes to the reviewer who provided this suggestion!"
2,Bad Mouse,"I got this mouse with a wireless microsoft keyboard, and while the keyboard works great, the mouse leaves much to be desired. It moves the cursor around fine and the laser generally picks up well when using a mousepad. Without a mousepad you might be in trouble. The problem is with the scrolling. It sometimes skips and does not always move as you are turning the wheel. I saw a review that said taking out the batteries fixes this, which it does for a while, but having to take out the batteries is annoying, and only a short term solution. I would never buy this mouse again knowing what I know now."
2,A poor device,Purchased at Office Depot.Wished I read reviews here firstNice size.Left and right click buttons feel nice.Other than that this mouse falls short.Responsiveness is weak and sometimes it just doesn't pick up.Scroll wheel feels cheap.I does not glide well on any surface including mouse pad.I would recommend considering another mouse. I intend to try to return this.
2,"I have trouble with scroll wheel, too","I like everything else about this mouse, but my scroll wheel works erratically. Anyone have any ideas about how to fix it? It's too late for me to return."
2,Promising but too many annoyances,"I found this mouse after long search for a simple, comfortable mouse. The mouse feels good in the hand, but after one day, I plan to return it.The biggest problem is that the wireless mouse uses 2 AA batteries, so it is very heavy! That is bad news for people how push mice around their desk all day. The scroll wheel feels good, but sometimes the first ""click"" of the scroll wheel doesn't scroll.The mouse is not Bluetooth. You must use an ugly ""wireless basestation"" USB dongle that looks like a big hockey puck (it's larger than the mouse itself).Also, I'm using this mouse on a Mac and Microsoft's Intellipoint software has astrange un-Mac-like mouse speed/acceleration."
2,Aggravating,"I received this mouse packaged with a keyboard as a Christmas present. The keyboard works 100% (although now I've probably put the whammy on myself), the mouse is one of the most irritating pieces of technology I've ever owned. For no good reason it constantly quits working. I've been through all the ""help"" (yeah, right) and nothing I've tried fixes it. It's not even 10 inches from the receiver with nothing blocking the signal, yet the cursor will totally freeze on-screen and nothing I try will make it start working. I end up having to re-boot to get it working again. I may keep the keyboard, but the mouse is going."
4,"Good wireless mouse, works well","Despite some of the previous bad reviews, I have found this mouse to be very good. Yes, the middle wheels clicks as you scroll, but this is carried over from the regular Microsoft corded mouse that has been so popular for 10 years. It works well. One of the best things about this mouse is that it requires no extra driver software to be installed. Many of the newer-style mice (like the Microsoft 5000 laser wireless mouse) require up to 100MB of hard drive space to install it's drivers. Hard drive space isn't the problem - it's all the extra software constantly running in the background that can cause conflicts with other programs and unnecessary RAM usage.All in all, I love this mouse - it has the same feel as my trusty ""regular"" Microsoft mouse, without having to worry about the cord getting hung up. No conflicts with my 2.4GHz phone or router, both sitting on the same desk. Recommended."

3,Brew Some Tea,I tried this for a while when the vet failed to diagnose my cat's thyroid problem. He and his brother stopped cuddling and started fighting so I looked for remedy to calm them. I'm not sure this did much for the cats at all. My sister just brews chamomile tea for hers.
3,Great in Theory,"The seller was very prompt in delivery and the product was packaged well. I wasn't extremely pleased with the product itself. It made my cat initially a bit more tolerant of her surroundings, but seemed to agitate her more after she'd taken it."
2,doesnt work all the well,"Does not work for more then an hour or soHad to keep trying to give more and more to my cat after surgery, she kept waking up trying to pull out the stitchesI would not recommend this product"
4,Fun book to have even after the wedding...,This was a nice book to have while planning my daughter's wedding. My family love all the Lion House recipes and so it was very special to have them for the wedding reception too. I would like to see an update of the pictures though.
4,VAIO VGN FS760,"Great screen and decent keyboard. The battery life is pretty good for me, I've gotten 3 hours out of it if wlan is off and I'm only running Word or Excell. What keeps me from giving it 5 stars is the software bundle (no nero burning rom, and roxio sucks) and the graphics card. Dedicated or not, 128 or not, virtually no ATI products, including tv tuners work with this machine. I'm not sure if this is ATI's fault or Nvida's but I'm still stuck with my TV Wonder USB 2 and I can't get it to work."
2,Not all that exciting.... and not too terribly robust.,"It's a PC after all. Anyway, a bit on the slow side, but used it from time to time to do things that were not supported via Mac.Worked pretty OK. Until today. The Ethernet connection no longer works... no matter what I plug into it, it does not recognize anything as being plugged in.Probably used it all of 80 hours, maybe... Pretty cr***y, if you ask me.(Personally never had anything so significant fail on any of my Macs.)"
4,Great book -- cute illustrations,"We bought this book through my son's Scholastic book club and it has quickly become a favorite. Even moms and dads can relate to Smudge as her morning goes horribly wrong (stubbed toe, buttons askew)! It's also a great book to illustrate to kids that everyone has a bad day that can get better and that everything will be OK."
2,The rosters are gone!,"The original edition of this book contained both a fine narrative of the operations of Pickett's Division at Gettysburg, and a detailed roster containing the most complete listing obtainable of the soldiers involved in the division's actions on 3 July 1863 (""Pickett's Charge""). Thomas Publications' reprint of this book, which is now the only version offered for sale, has deleted John W. Busey's roster portion entirely! While the narrative by Kathy Georg Harrison is first rate, those of you interested in the details of the division's organization at the battle will be most disappointed in this latest edition. The original 600+ page book is now only 168 pages long and contains only the narrative! If you are interested in the division's roster information, do not buy this most recent version! The roster is simply not there any longer!"
4,Nothing but Glory: Pickett's Division at Gettysburg,Wanted book for a gift to my son. Our GGrandfather is listed on the roster for the 1st Virginia in Kemper's Brigade
2,The mints that aren't very minty.,"These sound like they're going to be absolutely amazing. I'm a big fan of sencha/green tea in general and to combine it with lemongrass and/or pear? How can you go wrong? Unfortunately, these have an odd sort of aftertaste to them. They say they're completely organic on the packaging, but maybe they'd have done better to use regular sugar instead of whatever they used to sweeten them."
5,Simply delicious!,"Bought these to try as I was looking for something unique for tea party favors. I'm sorry now I didn't buy the 9 pack!First off, they are not traditional mints. In fact, there is no mint flavor at all in any of these. They are not mints in the flavor, but mints as a breathe freshener.The lemongrass is my favorite of the three flavors. Very strong lemongrass flavor over the green tea, but really well done.Pear is okay, but not overly pear flavored. Simple.And the regular, is a delicious green tea flavor. Simple, yet tastey.Good price for the three pack if you want to test them out like I did. I would reccommend buying the 9 pack once you decide which flavor you like best.My friends are going to love finding these in their goodies bags. I'm sure they are going to be a big hit!"
4,Decent mints,I got these a while back for me and my wife. They are good but it is an acquired taste. I handed them out to people and the majority of them liked it. I kept the tins and use them for other things to put in.
1,Doesn't hold a charge,"I bought this for a Canon SD10 to replace the stock battery which had a long and useful life. Right from the start the new battery didn't hold a charge anywhere near as long, and after a few charges it would only take four or five pictures before the low battery warning. I returned it for a new one and am having the same problem with it. Very disappointing.I'm back to buy a stock Canon battery, which despite having a lower rating (790ah versus 1000ah) performs much better. Beware ""equivalent"" batteries!"
2,turbo trackball,"The ball clogs regularly with dust, making it impossible to use the trackball until it is cleaned. This can be involved due to archiac design. Good concept, poor design. Save your money."
2,Disappointed,"After searching high and low for a replacement for the Logitech Trackman FX, with the large marble, we found the Turboball. The trackball was close to the same, large size, and we were hopeful that it would work out. However, less than 2 months after installing it, it stopped working. Very disappointing. I can't recommend this trackball."
4,So close to perfect...,"I don't think I've found a trackball that's come so close to perfect in so many ways as this one. This one has an exceptional hand-fit, four programmage keys, an essential scroll function, and that superb Kensington software. The fact that it's also so handtome only adds to the overall appeal. it's a joy to use.To a point. If you live in dusty environments (like mine), you'll have to clean the rollers of a worrisome accumulation of fibers and dirt. This is not only an inconveneince in the short term; it cuts down on the life of the trackball. This is not an optical device, so the movement becomes less than smooth over time.It's too bad, because the device is stellar - and in the simplest ways. If there were to be an optical version of this trackball, it would be a dream come true. As it is, I prefer it by a stretch over comparable devices by Logitech or Microsoft."
2,"Loud, stiff no fine control",I got this to replace a Logitech Optical mouse. This one has far less control and finesse. The buttons are LOUD when you click things so using it for gaming is really annoying. The whole thing is very large. It is like using a sizeable rock to rest your hand on.It is servicable but not recommended.
2,"Some good stuff, but weak overall.","I am a java programmer, eager to learn Flash fast. This book was only slightly useful. I found the chatty style just long-winded and condescending.Here's one example (p.56):""You're probably wondering just what the panel is, anyway. In effect, a panel is effectively what is known as a nonmodal dialog box. That is, a panel can be thought of as a dialog box that does not need to be closed.""In effect, this author needs effectively what is known as a good editor.The later chapters on actionScript are particularly weak. Too much ink spent defining terms and listing actions out of context. I needed more worked examples. I found the built-in lessons in the Flash Help more useful than this book.On a postive note, my tired old eyes really liked the large easy-to-read font used in this book. Why the heck do so many software texts have small fonts surrounded by acres of white space?"
2,Mac Users Beware!,"Although this book might be fine for someone who wants to use Flash MX strictly on a PC platform, Mac users will feel totally ignored. Not one single illustration of the Flash MX user features in this book is pictured using either the Mac OS9 or OSX interface. In fact, the only place in the entire 401 pages that Macintosh is even mentioned is in relation to how animations can be projected using a Mac. Bad form! Also, all potential buyers of this book, whether using a PC or a Mac, should be made aware that the exercises and illustrations used in this book to teach the Flash MX features are terribly juvenile. I returned this book the day I received it. I'll wait for a more ""grown up"" introduction to Flash MX that also incorporates Mac users."
1,Terribly wordy,I got really frustrated with the book. Long chapters with little substance. Very hard to find what you are looking for.Unnecessary repetition is annoying. Definitely not a book for me.
2,"Great Book, can't find refills","I love this book. It is adorable, but I have had the most horrible luck buying page refills. The pages measure 12.5 X 12. Not your standard size :(So if any one has a clue where to find these darn refills, let me know :)"
4,compucessory optical wireless mouse,This mouse is great that it is rechargeable. It is very sensitive to the touch but very comfortable. I really haven't had it long enough to know how well it will last over time. I recommend this product.
4,Great Overview of New Functionality,"This book came out when SQL Server 2005 was still in Beta. Even though the product has already shipped, I would still recommend this book to anyone wanting a broad overview of the product suite. It covers what's new in the development and administration tools, T-SQL enhancements, and overviews of Notification Services, SQL Server Service Broker, XML Integration, Reporting Services, Integration Services, and Analysis Services. Even though it's a high-level perspective there are enough code snippets and technical details to keep it interesting. The author is Senior Technical Editor of SQL Server Magazine, and the book is excellently written."
4,Writing to Heal,"I found the exercises in this book easy to do. I also found it interesting that you were asked to limit the number of days you wrote. I guess I have a tendancy to want to dwell on things. Writing as I did, did seem to help me deal with the issue on which I focused. Pennebaker is a credible researcher and this approach is based on empirical study. I recommend it to others."
4,"Great Price, Pretty good TV","Got this at Sam's Club for $998.00. A very nice TV for this price. Sure, it might not compare to those $3,000 TV's, but its very worth it. If anything, a great bedroom TV.I've only had one problem with it so far. Upon turning it on for the first time, I noticed some white spots in the upper left corner of the screen. Everyone is telling me that these are dead pixels and happens now and again to all kinds of LCD TV's. Typical defect, so all I need to do is find that pesky receipt and exchange it.Hope this reviews helps."
4,"Great picture, good value","We got this set at Sam's Club. It's a fine set with a good picture even in a well-lit room. The only small issue with it is that when the room is cold, it takes a little time for it to turn on. We keep the thermostat turned down to 50 when we're not home and it can take as long as four or five minutes before it comes on. This is our first LCD set, so I can't say if this is a general characteristic of LCD sets or just this model.Based on our experience, I would definitely by this set again."
5,Dream Seasons Collection I Dream of Winter,"Barbie is absolutely beautiful. I collect Barbies and she is a great addition to my collection. Durability is not a problem for me, as the Barbie dolls stay in the box."
5,A winter fantasy,She is stunning in her light blue dress and white cape. The color of her dress makes her light skin and blond hair stand out. She is dressed more like a cloud then winter.
3,Good read but not a keeper.....,"I enjoyed this book but I wasn't blown away. The heroine (a female robin hood) and hero (carefree rake) were both believable and likable but were missing that certain something that makes readers feel that they were actually there. The story was comical at times and had me laughing out loud and it had it's share of sensual scenes, but it was just too predictable. You were just waiting for him to find out he was taken in by the ""Black Angel"" and when he did it lacked intensity. The ending seemed rather forced and was not terribly exciting.It was entertaining and worth reading, just don't expect it to knock your socks off. Although, I can't say it's one of my favorites, I won't hesitate to buy another of her novels."
3,my least favorite of this series,What a disappointment. I couldn't wait to read this one. I'd read the others and they were wonderful. This one is lacking. Maybe the writer was being rushed to meet a deadline? Wish I could say something good about it. I will not share details and spoil it for you.
5,Another hit!,"This was my first Carlyle book and I am hooked!I have since read a few more, but this one is definitely a hit!Fun story with excellent sizzlin' scenes."
4,A female robin hood ............,"is our heroine in this regency with a different angle. She's the illegitimate daughter of a noble and is 'teaching' ruthless rakes a lesson. Sidonie is very creative and very daring thus making a delightful lead. The reader enjoys every minute of the justice she metes out with glee. But it's hard not to love the devil duke she has robbed. He is so tormented and has a heart to die for........Seconardy characters are sound and vivid. Not sure I'll ""keep"" this one but it certainly was an enjoyable read."
4,Funny and different!,"Laugh-out-loud-funny! I laughed on the bus while I was reading this and then I had to explain, ""Sorry. Funny book."" It was embarrassing, but worth it. Besides being funny (in situation and dialogue), it was also a well-written historical, atypical in its characters. We got BOTH a rough-around-the-edges hero AND heroine, which you hardly ever see, especially in a historical. Great, fun read!"
1,...,"This book was terrible! I couldn't believe there were no bad reviews on this. I HATED the ""hero."" He was so awful, and the sex scene was really borderline rape. Half the time I had no clue what was even going because there were so many characters and too much dialogue. I was so thoroughly disgusted by this book, and I wanted SO much to like it, but Devellyn was so mean! He acted drunk half the time as well, making me wonder if he was even conscious of what was going on around him. I felt that I should feel somewhat sympathetic with him, but he was so cruel for so long that I just didn't care anymore what his problem was."
5,Lovely,"I love this watch. It is can go from dressy to casual with no problem. I have the silver with gold tones. The gold does not show as prevalent as it does in the photo, but it still looks great. You will never have this watch fall off your arm. It is very difficult to get the two sides of the bracelet apart after the clasp is loosened. It took me a day or so to learn how to shake my arm just right while holding the watch to get the ends to separate. Great looking watch."
1,Thanks from the UK,"Just a wee note to let you know Cloud Nine has arrived safely in Kintore and I am toe tappin', thigh slappin', hand clappin' and head bobbin' as I listen to the CD with the occasional yelp of sheet joy at the wonderful tune selection, arrangements and awesome playing. a wonderful pick me up after a hard day's slog at work."
5,Highly Recommeded Book,"When reading books that serve as Design Guides, the litmus test for it's effectives lies in the answer to the following question, - ""Did this book really help me in implementing a solution?"" The answer for me was a resounding ""YES"" especially with regards to Label Security and Proxy Authentication. David Knox does a great job of explaining database security concepts through his examples. Furthermore the passage of an identity through the various layers of an n-tier computing model is clearly explained. The author has done a marvelous job of distilling and articulating his experiences in the information security space."
3,Good book if you use Enterprise flavor of Oracle,"This book is simple and complete security book for Oracle, but it is necessary to use Oracle Enterprise solution and Oracle Identity Management components.50% of these book it is not possible to use with Oracle Standard DBMS"
3,Not too helpful for the security beginner,"I'm trying to set up proxy authentication and the book made a lot of assumptions about what I know. The author uses the SCOTT, BLAKE and APP_USER accounts and assumes that we know exactly how these accounts where set up. It would seem that the APP_USER account seems to be the schema owner, or is it the SCOTT and BLAKE accounts. Am I to assume that the SCOTT account is the defualt demo account that is setup by oracle? Being new to high level Oracle security I would have preferred a step-by-step approach to solving my security problems. I noticed that all other reviews where by people that seem to have a handle on this and just needed hints. Even the setting up of an LDAP sever was confusing, we never got it to work and even after following the steps did not get the same things that the author got. Even though I have not been a DBA for too long I have been using Oracle for 20 years now, so I'm not a novice."
3,Straight-up Thin Lizzy-style material,"If you are a Thin Lizzy fan you'll enjoy this album. If you're not you won't. Strength: the Lizzy guitar sound, from one of its architects, Brian Robertson, whose project this is. Weaknesses: the singing and, even though it's expected, the cliched lyrics, especially on the first song, which is about that depressingly overused heavy metal topic, the plight of the American Indian. The CD has two bonus tracks from a concert in Japan that aren't that good."
3,Worth getting for Brian Robertson's guitar playing,"Songs on the album reminded variously of Thin Lizzy, Boston, the Beatles and Super Tramp. Although the songs are polished and professional there are no obvious ""blockbusters"" and the vocals seemed bland (perhaps Phil Lynotts cool distinctive tones could have given the necessary lift?). However, this album does sound pretty good in spite of that. I enjoyed listening to it straight away -- mainly I think for Brian Robertson's guitar playing. His playing seems always to be tasteful, fresh and exciting. The 2 new bonus live tracks at the end are fun: Rocky Mountain Way (Eagles?) & Saturday Night. One of the songs seemed a bit more pop than I would have expected (like Thin Lizzy plays ""Video Killed the Radio star"") - not bad though."
2,Great Idea---Pesky Zippers!,"I eagerly anticipated the Bundle Me Big's arrival to my house. It worked great in conjunction with my jogging stroller for about 2 weeks. I removed it to wash EXACTLY per the manufacturer's instructions and when dry, the zippers were stuck and one had broken. First of all, it makes no sense to have 4 zippers on one simple product. Secondly, the teeth are very hard to match up. I have been disappointed by this product and will probably end up rigging something for my stroller that doesn't come in at such a high price--especially for an item that will be too short by the time my son reaches 18 months!"
3,Good value,"This product is a good value when compared to other stroller covers. It is nice and warm, and even my busy 18-mo-old doesn't mind being bundled up in it. However, the zippers do get stuck a lot. I had the same problem with the zippers on the infant bundle me, but it didn't stop me from purchasing the toddler version because I didn't want to spend twice as much."
5,A Must Have for Winters,"This is a must have for toddlers in the winter--better than carrying blankets for strollers and carseats. At first I was debating if I should spend $50 on the bundler, but it is worth the money."
5,Grammy made a big hit!,"I bought the Bundle Me for my grandson for Christmas. It's a little big for him, but it keeps him warm right now and it will continue to work for at least the next year, which was the idea. Now his Mommy (my daughter) and he can take a walk on a cold winter day with no cold toes. We just went to the Albuquerque Aquarium (which is indoors and heated) and the botanical gardens (which are outdoors and cold) and he was snug as a bug in a rug."
2,Not as advertised - you still need a coat,"Do not believe the manufactures claims that you don't need a jacket if you have this bunting.We had a 7am Enfant bunting for our daughter for her first winter and loved it. It had a hood (that could be unzipped) and completely covered her up and kept her toasty warm without any extra clothing. Now she has outgrown it and I bought one of these as a replacement.There is no way by any stretch of anyones imagination that you can use this bunting without needing a coat and hat as well. The zip only zips to about half way up the chest of my one year old. Yes you could pull up the flap to cover her chest but she just pushes it down again since there is no way to keep it up!It did keep her just about warm enough with a coat, hat and mittens at a temp of 35F, but I want something that you can use without a coat.After much research I am returning this (after a single outing) and getting a Little Kazook instead (which zips all the way up and has a hood)."
1,definitely too small,"Well, I just tried the Bundle Me (toddler size) with my 20-month old in our jog stroller for the first time today and I am disappointed because it is definitely already too small. He really can't sit in the bag unless his legs are bent, which he hates. Plus, when I have the bag pulled as far down as possible in the stroller (the only way I can get him in at all), then it only zips to just above his waist -- definitely not high enough to really get warm and snuggly.I'll keep the bag for baby #2, but I'm really disappointed I can't use it with my not quite 2-year old."
3,Not safe in car seat,"I bought this for the stroller and car seat. The openings aren't long enough for the car seat straps - I had to loosen the straps a LOT to pull them through and buckle my child in. I have read that loose straps aren't safe, so I have to buckle my child in and tuck the Bundle Me in around her legs. I do love it in the stroller, it's just not safe in the car seat. One that wraps around the seat (like the Fleece Warmer) is probably safer."
5,Love It!,"We love the Bundle Me! Our daughter just grew out of the infant size and we purchased the toddler. We like it for the fact that it doesn't completely smother her and zip up to her face! She never liked her arms being swaddled as a new born and this is perfect because it still keeps her body, legs and feet warm, but she can keep her arms out and move them. If it's really cold out then we put on a jacket. If it's not very cold, then we don't have to! Perfect =)"
1,NOT BIG ENOUGH!,I bought this item despite the review that said it was too small. Big mistake. It is small! It's not big enough for my 21 months old. I'm very dissapointed because I liked the infant version.
3,The zippers are too short,"It looks cute and the sherpa-style material feels really good. However, when I tried to zip it around my baby, I found the zippers don't go high enough to cover my baby's chest. It may be a good blanket for spring and fall, but definitely not a coat for winter. You can't eliminate coat/jacket if you take your baby out in a cold day unless you want her to get a cold. I hope they improve the product by letting the zippers go higher to cover the chest and even the shoulders."
2,Too small,I bought this for my daughter when she was 1 year old. I could barely zip it around b/c it is so small. I keep checking the tags to make sure I got the right size and not the infant one. I looked at some other reviews and saw many people were having the same problem. It's a great product for smaller children.
2,Not so big,"I actually bought two of these in the diva urban style. I have two girls 11 months and 29 months. It wasn't big enough for the two year old it only went half way up her chest. She is not that big either--- weighs 29lbs. I really liked the way it looked and the material but for the cost I couldn't see keeping it. I don't think it would have lasted through the winter. I wish they would make them bigger. So I ended up purchasing the Kiddopotomus brand ""Go Cozy"". It is not as pretty and it secures with velcro but it is much larger and it goes up to 4years. It is also much less expensive."
5,Worked great in the stroller,This is a must for Canadian winters and it worked just great. It kept my little one dry and warm when we went for walks. I had no problems with the zipper as I have had with other ones and it washes well.
4,Fun New Christmas Songs,"Some sleepers, but on the whole a fun upbeat album. Our favoritesChristmas time again at Neiman Marcus, My Top Ten,Elvis has been sighted at the North Pole, Christmas time in Texas and Red Christmas."
5,Supercade: A Visual History of the Videogame Age '71-'84,"The video industry took the world by storm on the 70s and 80s.In many ways- it still does. Children of all ages are fascinated with the legendary Pac-Man, Ape Escape, bubble boble, Snowbounding, Wings of Fury and a host of other action games.This book chronicles the development of the video culture intoa virtual frenzy. It is perfect for video enthusiasts everywhere."
4,a bit unfocused,"I did enjoy this book and it was entertaining and informative, but it was really long (and heavy!). I think it would have been much better if she had made this either a book on the history of video games or a photography book focusing on video games. It is comprehensive of the era it covers (1979-1984?), including both coin-op and console games, which is different from the similar book ""Arcade Fever"" by John Sellers. If you are looking to impress your guests with a coffee-table book on video games, this is it. If you are looking to read a book on the history of video games, check out The Ultimate History of Video Games by Steve L. Kent."
5,Beautiful. Stunning.,"Not much to say-- it's really awesome, the interviews are great and the screen art is fantastic. The book ends at the bust of the industry but you'll love the glory years."
2,"Interesting content, but the book itself is horribly made","For anyone interested in early videogame history, this is a nice coffee table book to have lying around. It's filled with interesting information and game trivia. Nothing deep, but there are other books for that (""Understanding Video Games"" is one that comes to mind). However, what really kills this book is that, unless you plan to have it sitting sexily on some book shelf, it WILL fall apart. The pages and cover are of excellent quality, but the binding appears to be double-sided tape. Open the book up at the middle, and there goes your spine."
5,Gorgeous and beautiful,"Finally, a book about the classic era of videogames that strikes a gorgeous balance between history lesson, nostalgia trip, and that initial lo-tech excitement that videogames garnered back in their early '80s heyday. The design of this coffeetable book is beautiful, jam-packed with images, many familiar, others of rarely-seen videogame gems. The articles that are interspersed amongst the large images are well-written and informative. A very immersive book, one that belongs on every classic gamer's coffeetable -- perfect for a quick flipping through of pages by curious house guests, after which you will soon be suckering them into a few quick rounds of arcade classics on your Playstation (or hell, even your Atari 2600, if you still have one.) A bit pricey, but hey, it's a huge, hefty, HARDCOVER book, so what do you expect? It's worth it."
3,Good readance,"This is an incredibly informative book (better be for the price). It's not fun reading, though. Doesn't capture the pure nostalgia of what the era was all about. Was a little text-booky, which doesn't seem to be quite the right tone. Very cool images, though. If you can afford it."
2,"large, big book","this is a rather large book, more of a visual treat than a book. It has a generous helping of photographs, all of them in colour. That alone is worth the price of the book. A good coffee table book."
2,"Photos of Old Games? Try the Internet, they're free.","Okay, I love games and I especially love classic games. But I don't love this book.I seriously can't imagine who would enjoy paying big bucks for a heavy collection of photos of old arcade games when the same pictures are available for free on the Internet. The games themselves are available for free, too! And do I really need to read tiny bits of history (essentially copied verbatim from other, better books on video game history) interspersed between these pictures?If I wanted a book on gaming history, I would definitely do better to spend my money elsewhere. And if I wanted to relive my old arcade fantasies, I would do it by playing the games, not looking at a book of photos. Supercade is a lot of hype, a lot of style, and no substance."
4,Creating a new life in Georgetown and exploring a tragic past,"Faith finds her world falling apart as she discovers that her husband, a conservative activist, has been having an affair with another man. She must find means to support her children in the DC area and help them with the upheaval in their lives. Her mother agrees to allow them to live in the row house in Georgetown, site of the tragic disappearance of Faith's older sister as a baby. The place is a wreck after years of being a rental. Faith finds two friends, one in the long time next door neighbor and one in a stranger who offers help with getting the piano moved. Faith begins to research her family's past and the kidnapping as she struggles with putting together a new life, with one child starting to blossom in the new environment and one beginning to self destruct. While there were several points that stretched credulity, overall it was an interesting novel."
3,Enjoyable.,"This CD was actually one of my first introductions to gothic and darkwave music. Its really not the best compilation, but its good for background music, lazying about the house, and late nights with the lights out and candles lit. =) The most outstanding artists on this I think are Voltaire and Black Tape for a Blue Girl. Voltaire has an amusing song that reminded me of a certian anime character. (cookies if you guess who it is.) If you liked Voltaire I reccomend him muchly. I espically love his song ""Dead Girls."" Very amusing. I also loved the song ""A Girl Called Harmony"" by Attrition. Another is ""Don't Fear The Reaper"" by Unto Ashes... If you love this kind of music, Id also reccomend you check out the singer Rasputina. =)"
4,Successful Projekt!,A very nice intro cd. Great opportunity to list to a selection of songs. I've since purchased CDs by several of the featured artists. Do more!
3,Typical but cute,"Didn't have high hopes for this one, but wasn't disappointed by it, either. Typical historical romance, with a heroine falling in love with a fellow whom her parents disapprove of, and a reluctant love interest whose inner demons keep him from pursuing a meaningful relationship. The inner demons turn out to be pretty cliche, as does the ""independent"" heroine archetype, but the writing and quick progression of events keep everything from getting too boring. I liked the setting--had never heard how integral salvaging was to the Key West economy. If you want a sweet story with some history, a little sex, and a lot of happenings, this one is for you."
2,spelling counts!,"a fascinating and fast-moving story spoiled by spelling and usage errors [including listing a year as in the 1950's which should have been in the 1850's and the use of wrong like-sounding words.] i don't have the time to go back to the exact spots where errors occurred [one of the disadvantages of kindle reading], but there were quite a few, and i've seen this in other low-cost kindle books also. if that's the price we have to pay for the low cost of these books, i guess i'll live with it, but it takes away from the pleasure of reading them.that said, i want to praise the author for her on-target portrayals of female sexuality and of how a sensitive and caring man can please a woman."
5,"A timeless classic from ""El Sonero Mayor"".","This 1974 release from Ismael Rivera is truly indispensable. Timeless Salsa classics like ""El Nazareno"", ""Que Te Pasa A Ti"", ""Witinila"", ""Yo No Quiero Piedras En Mi Camino"" and the title track were all huge hits that sound as great today as they did back in 1974. When you listen to (and enjoy) this ageless classic of Puerto Rican Salsa you will understand why Ismael is regarded as Puerto Rico's greatest Salsa sonero (improvising Salsa singer). To top it all off, this CD reissue's sound quality is EXCELLENT (Thank You, Emusica Records!). Enjoy!"
4,THe perfect storm,"In my opinion, their best release, downloaded it from amazon, owned 3 copies over the few years it has been released. Will buy it again if I need to. The way the vocals sit in the mix is sick, overwhelming at first listen, in a good way. Buy it."
2,Tool offspring??,"Okay, so the references to the band Tool are well deserved. However, they blatantly milk the Tool sound so much that you'd believe it was Tool until the dude starts growling into the mix. Did they say to themselves, ""We know we wanna sound just like Tool, so maybe if we growl a bunch of nonsense over the music, people will think we're original."" It would seem so.So if you enjoy the instrumental side of Tool, and you can get past the dude's growling drivel, you may actually like this."
3,Not something I'd listen to much,"I'm all for change and growth, but this is still easily my least favorite Isis album. The material isn't necessarily bad, it's just so over-produced that it comes off as plodding and mechanical, and the band's vocals never have been and probably never will be strong enough to be given such a prominent place in the mix. There are a couple of good tracks on there, but, for my money, it's not as strong as their previous works."
5,ISIS's most consistent album,"While I love the raw sounds of Oceanic and Celestial, ISIS's newer material has intrigued me the most. Panopticon seemed untouchable - and the came In the Absence of Truth: a masterpiece of post-rock, metal, sludge, and everything in between. The standout tracks on In the Absence of Truth are Wrists of Kings, Dulcinea, Holy Tears, and Garden of Light. Vocals go from normal to growling to more experimental than before, and the drumming on this album outdoes anything on previous ISIS albums. This is one of the finest albums of 2006, without a doubt. Highly recommended."
2,a dissapointment through the eye's of isis...,"i will start off by saying that i have been a die hard isis fan since the early days of mosquito control..and no im am not going to rag on this album b/c it isnt as heavy as their previous releases...however i am going to rag on this album b/c with the exeption of maybe three songs THE ENTIRE ALBUM SOUNDS THE SAME...now this wouldnt even be a bad thing if what it sounded like was actually interesting and or innovative as all of isis's previous releases have been..but i.t.a.o.t isnt...now im sure that all of these people that have given it a 5 star rating are extreme tool obsessionists who have very little relavence as far as im concerened about a professional rating of an isis' album..in conclusion this cd is dry,elementry (compared to previous releases),substantially unbalanced,and ultimatly dissapointing..."
3,Not True Isis,"This album makes me wonder if Isis has gotten too wrapped up in the attention they have been receiving. Almost like an underground sell-out. I have been a fan of Isis for years. I own everything they have ever made, with the exception of demos, and own all of their side projects but when i listened to this and read their interview in a magazine i began to feel that our great Isis is softening up, and watering down. True Isis lies in the albums Red Sea and maybe Panopticon, but not this piece. Very dissapointed."
5,A Good Book for Introducing III-V Devices,"This is a popular book for introducing III-V semiconductor devices, and I think this will be the best one for beginners. However, the author can't put too much information in this book due to the restriction of volume. Thus, sometimes this book is also not very clear in some details, but this is still a very good book!"
5,Great for recording meetings,"This device has incredible reception capability. Put it in a large room with lots of people, and it picks up from across the room with ease. It stores many hours of interviewing. Is easy to transfer to laptop and listen there. Within the laptop, you can adjust where you want to start listening.I found the features like bookmarks to be confusing, and can actually make it hard to find recordings. If you want to listen to a recording with the device, no fun as you cannot start in the middle or fast forward (but again, can when transferred to the laptop or PC). Software for this is solid.I am a consultant who continually interviews and do not want to have to take too detailed of notes. This device is excellent for those who want high quality recordings. It would be easy to put in shirt pocket and record that way too.For MP3, while it takes them, why bother.It does have a speaker that works fairly well if 2 or more people wanted to listen to."
5,Handy little recorder & MP3 player,I really love my Irock combo voice recorder and MP3 player. The software is straightforward and easy to use. The features I love the most are: 1) its tiny size - fits in any pocket and you can carry it everywhere - it's about the size of a pack of gum; 2) the voice recorder - the sound quality is pretty good and I use it frequently. On the downside the erase function is a bit awkward to use. But this is a minor flaw in an overall excellent little gadget.
1,Not Very Long Lasting,"I had and used this little piece of plastic for a few months and put it in a drawer for another three. When it came out for the next use and a fresh battery installed, it was completely dead. Don't waste your time or money."
3,A Long Term Review,"It seems as if there are a lot of over zealous reviews coming in from brand new users. Indeed, my experience with this computer was quite good when I first purchased it 2 years ago, but it is starting to wear a little thin now. It just seems outdated in terms of design, and slightly underpowered in comparison to other computers. Rather good, though, for basic ( I mean basic too!) multimedia needs, and should be accessorized with good Adobe software (Photoshop, etc.)"
1,wrong part for my car,"i took my car in and my mechanic said it's the wrong part. not sure what went wrong, i followed Amazon's recommendation based on the my car's year and model. i wish to return it."
3,The quest for the Golden Cat,"Ed Lowe was an entrepeneur extrordinaire. He created an industry and lived to see it grow into a major category. With his wealth, he helped many young people become successful entrepeneurs. He left behind a strong legacy as outlined in his book."
4,The D-devils are back!,"Loved it!, But not quite up to par with my favorite ""Sex and Drugs and House""."
2,NOT SO GREEN,"THIS IS A LIVE ALBUM & AUSTRALIAN IMPORT. THE PACKAGING IS A LITTLE SKIMPY, AND ALTHOUGH SONGWRITING CREDITS ARE PROVIDED (SOME INACCURATELY), THE SOURCE OF THE MATERIAL ISN'T. AN EDUCATED GUESS IS THAT THIS WAS RECORDED IN THE LATE 70'S, EARLY 80'S; DEFINITELY BEFORE JONES' COMEBACK. ALTHOUGH THERE IS A GENEROUS SELECTION OF GREAT SONGS, THE ARRANGEMENTS ARE SPARE & JONES DOESN'T SOUND VERY INSPIRED... HE JUST PLOWS THROUGH THE MATERIAL LETHARGICALLY. THE PRICE IS VERY REASONABLE, THOUGH, & THE SOUND QUALITY IS GOOD & IF THESE VERSIONS ARE UNAVAILABLE ELSEWHERE, THIS COULD APPEAL TO RABID FANS & COMPLETIONISTS. OTHERWISE, LOOK FOR A CAREFULLY SELECTED ANTHOLOGY OF THE MAN DOING HIS PRIME MATERIAL."
4,"lots of fun, better phrasing than volume 1","i like this record mostly. my absolute favorite on here is the giuliani grand overture op.61...romero's playing here is absolutely goregous...breathtaking. also exceptional are the mudarra and the rodrigo and scarlatti. its only like 7 bucks so just buy it. some people complained of weird phrasing on vol. 1 of this series, but i am glad to say that this problem isnt really present here. the only thing that i dislike really is guardame las vacas...i feel that he sacrafices good phrasing for the sake of a display of speed...such playing isnt needed for a traditional piece like this."
5,"functional, and stylish","When i first saw a piece of knork flatware, I had to get a set. The design is not only stylish, but ergonomic too."
5,Individual Wrap is the Best,"Twizzlers are so much better when they are individually wrapped and this product hits the nail on the head. It ships fast, stores great anywhere in your house, and is really nice when you get a craving for that red rope like candy!"
3,Shoe Shopaholic,"I bought this because of the brand, but they feel very narrow. Perhaps if you get 1/2 size larger they'll fit better."
3,"Not bad, not great",Whatever sagacity I sought from Wittgenstein regarding religion was somewhat lacking. The conversation he has regarding religion really touches more on death than on theology. Not quite what I was looking for. The section on religion is a bit of a misnomer.
4,SHADES OF GRAM,"I'm a big Gram Parsons' fan and I'd just like to alert newer Gram fans to this album and the accompanying Drinkin' album. Gram was a big Merle fan, and these albums certainly show how much he was influenced by Merle's vocal phrasing and his musical arrangements. There's also versions of Sing Me Back Home (a Merle composition) and Green Green Grass Of Home, both of which Gram covered. Buy these albums - and a Louvin Brothers compilation - to see what inspired young Gram.May the spirit of Gram be with us always,Cherokee Bonnet"
4,Nice tool.,Cuts clean and makes nice turns. Does require a sold air supply. Average compressor at home might not provide enough air pressure to make long cuts.
1,Reviving the Shepherding Movement,"Although Bynum does not have enough historical knowledge to be aware of it, this dangerous little book attempts to revive the dangerous teachings of the shepherding movement of the '70s, which elevated the authority of pastors over that of the still, small, internal voice of the Spirit. Bottom line: Obey your pastor, even if he's wrong. God will bless you for it. If you don't, you'll never get your ""spiritual inheritance."""
3,much better Esleman books out there,"Estleman has written dozens of books over the years, most of them stellar examples of crime fiction (he also writes Westerns once in a while). His Amos Walker series of crime fiction novels is particularly good. This novel, however, is one in his Peter Macklin series about a Detroit hit man, published in 1985. I had never read any of the Macklin books before, so I was looking forward to this one. While it was fairly interesting, I didn't think it was nearly as well written as the Amos Walker books or his excellent Detroit historical crime fiction series (Whiskey River, Motown, King of the Corner, Edsel, Jitterbug, etc.). Still, this is a writer more mystery fans should read."
4,Pure pleasure,"Ah, Richard Tauber. He brings back memories of summer. His voice is like a light and refreshing breeze. This selection of songs suits his voice and he sings them with great feeling and warmth.He never was one of the great tenors but had a sweetness in his voice that was unmistakable. Not too many people remember him but he is worth listening to even if only to take you back if you are of a certain age.I highly recommend this little collection for the music enthusiast."
3,Listening to Tauber,"Take ""Very Best of"" out of the title and the result and its purchase will be fair. Anyway, it is nice to have, but I'll keep on looking for a recording with clearer unveiled sound."
4,Roots of decline,"Islam's relying on Slave soldiers to protect and defend its empire was the root of its decline. The slave soldier neither has the interest or the caring to defend his homeland, rather like a mercenary he fights for his life and runs away at the earliest possible moment when all seems lost. This book develops the scholarship on Islam's early use of slave soldiers, making the arguemtn that the weakness and distrust of the early Islamic rulers led them to adopt slaves, who had no kin, no tribe, and therefore would be apolitical. The fact that all four of the first Caliphs were assasinated certainly helped this idea on its way. The second major factor in choosing slaves is that the Bedouin soldiers and raiders who propelled Islam out of Arabia were not reliable soldiers and could not wage set piece battles, all though this military fact is overlooked this is a good study and goes half way to explaining the failure of Islamic Jihadist armies at Lepanto and Poiters.Seth J. Frantzman"
1,bad,I bought this to replace a broken one of the same brand (for a coworker). This one broke (with light duty) within a week. We decided to replace it with a different brand screw driver.
4,Excellent costume -- a little big,"I am 5'6"" and of a medium build, and this costume was just slightly too large for me. It was not a big deal, but the red booties flopped all over. The costume held up very well, I am just not too certain how easy it will be to clean it.The cardboard/styrofoam chest piece is very easy to crease, but the way they packed/shipped it minimized any creases. When I packed it up to store it though, it was a little more difficult."
2,Disappointing,"I am returning this costume. The cape's stitching is coming undone out of the package. Like most kids age 4-7 costumes are not just worn on halloween and this will not last. As mentioned, the muscles are not soft but a hard substance. Ours came flattened and never popped back out giving a lopsided muscle chest and producing a very disappointed 4 year old."
3,"looks great, but...","this is a really great looking suit. but they should really make it in more sizes. we were disappointed that the chest piece was so big. the size as far as height was fine for the medium, but there is a really big difference between a 38in chest and a 40in chest. they should have made it in the three different chest sizes. after spending another $70 to get it taylored it fits great now. to put the sizing into perspective I have a 38in chest, the taylor had to cut off 3 inches from each sholder, and removed a total of 7 inches of material and added a zipper up the back to pull the whole torso tighter, also she put toe cups on so that the boot pieces would stay in place. I think most people that are spening $100 or more on a costume would not mind spending a few extra $ initially to get a product that fits better."
5,Another Winner,This book was even better than the first! I love Susan's character. Even though she betrayed Steph's trust with Tiffany Susan was willing to fess up. My heart ached for her when she found Johnnie and Steph together. Johnnie is a nasty character and I wouldn't mind her being booted from the story! This book had me in tears! Another well written masterpiece from Ms. Chatelain!
2,black hand crocheted beanie,It was a nice cute hat however it is EXTREMELY tight on my head. So it doesn't really fit how I was hopinh because it slides off my head often which ruins the whole point of it.
1,Unhappy with product,"I ordered a gray/blue ""beanie"" and was very happy with it....so I thought I'd get a black one. It was tiny: child sized and barely fits on my head. As with the blue gray one I had to cut the elastic to make it wearable (and unreturnable), but even loosened up it did not fit. Really poor quality item. Stick with the other colors (or have a crafty friend make you one!)."
1,Looks better in photo,"I've been wanting a nice, somewhat loose, crochet beanie. Should have saw the red flag when I saw that the price was cheaper than the rest. This fit horribly and did not look good at all. It was kind of disgusting... would not recommend."
2,okay...,"wasn't what i was looking for, it's bigger than the other's i purchased but it's still too tight and small. don't buy unless you're looking to suffocate your head -.-"
2,small,"This is not sized for an adult, unless you have a particularly small head! I was lured by the price, but save your money."
2,not sure if it's the service or the phone...,"Well I do know that at various times, the service just drops calls...some times worse than others. The phones, however, seem to pick up and amplify sound to the person on the other end...people are always asking what's that noise...and seem annoyed at even the slightest sound. So I think the main problem is the phone. We've had ours just about 2 years and now we are replacing the batteries because they've lost their ability to stay charged...we'll see if that helps any other problems???? Sometimes I feel like the cell phone commericals ""...can you hear me now?"""
4,Thumbs Up!,I use these for my businees phones and at $29.99 you can't really go wrong. Lots of features and unlimited use.... what's not to like? The phones work great and installed with no problems. Simply made a call to Vonage to add the Mac Address and that was it..... my service is up and running!
4,"Works great, nice phone","I bought these for my Vonage service about 6 months ago. I connected them behind my router, per their instructions, and was up and running within 10 minutes. Since then, I've had one minor complaint that was fixed within minutes by Vonage (the time/date on the phone was not correct for my area code). Otherwise, these phones work as advertised.I won't review Vonage, except to say that as a reasonably technically savvy person, I've had zero problems with the service in my year of being with them. I have the $14.99 a month plan, and it all works just fine for me."
2,Several standard features are lacking on this phone.,"I purchased this phone several (5-6) months ago. The appearance is very similar to my previous VTech phone. I was interested in the phone because I thought it would be a good fit with my Vonage service. What I've found is that this phone is inferior in many ways to the VTech phone I purchased 5 years ago. There is no message light on the phones themselves. Yes, there is a blinking light on the base unit and ""message waiting"" text appears in the display on the phones, but this is MUCH less visable than having a blinking light on the actual phones (like my old VTech phones). Also, the display on the phones lacks information like the time of day and remaining battery charge. I don't understand why VTech removed useful features - I assumed a new phone would have new technological features and instead it is a big step backwards. I am very disappointed I purchased this phone."
5,"Works great, big money saver...","This is a great product, and I'm saving money every month. I wanted to change over to VoIP but didn't want to mess around with phone wiring and such. The VTech 8100-2 system was a great solution for me. All I needed to do was to connect it to my cable modem and with it's wireless handsets, my whole house was online with VoIP.The only problem I've run into has been if my computer is heavily downloading, and using up most of my bandwidth. With that happening, I've had the sound cut out on my phone calls. I've been told that if I had a router that supported QOS, I could avoid that problem.I was paying about $36 a month for my old phone service, plus about $20 a month for Long Distance charges. Now, $24.95 gets me unlimited long distance in the US, Canada, and PR... So I'm saving a bit over $30 a month."
1,Save your money,"These phones suck! I'm on my second set and have yet to be able to get it to connect. It just sits on yellow. Apparently this is a common problem. If you are one of the lucky few who actually got them to work, yeah for you.The problem is with the software used in the phones. They should have gone with a simple sip config such as what's used on linksys units, but no. Vonage has no clue how to fix it, you get nothing from VTech and even the computer geeks in the forums are at a loss. They all say the same thing the software in the phones suck!Save yourself time, money and aggravation and get the linksys product."
2,Description was deceiving,The description of the product was deceiving. The photo showed a router and 2 handsets. The description talked about the router and both handsets. All I received was 1 handset.
1,Vonage Yes - VTech No!,"I've had vonage for a couple of years and it works great! I live in a suburban area with great utility wiring and maintenance and we have Comcast - this makes a difference in how well Vonage works. In our old house Comcast took over from Jones cable and we had more problems until Comcast invested in replacing old Jones wiring and equipment since then it has worked great.VTech Broadband Phone -When we moved I thought I would just get this instead of altering the phone lines to use our linksis router - big mistake! This turkey did not even cluck. Vonage customer service did their best but nothing ever happened.I returned this, had vonage register my phone with my old device again got a friend to set up the phone lines to work for us and have been happy ever since.If it is supposed to be easy to set up and use then a company should ensure that is the case before they send out a product marketed as easy that actually requires a membership card to the techie club to figure out."
1,Very Disappointing Product and Documentation,"I was under whelmed with this unit. As stated in the previous review, this is a very expensive pass through for HDMI signals. The documentation was miserable to follow often referring the user to diagrams on pages 3+ pages away -- leads to constant flipping through the manual. The user's manual was obviously written by an engineer and very difficult to follow. I tried to set up my 6.1 Bose System and repeated attempts failed. When I attempted to get help from Harmon Kardon, they didn't even have a toll free number to call. This product is a bust and I strongly suggest you spend you money on a receiver where the company has kept the end user in mind."
3,Good explanation of game,"After buying the game I didn't play it much because I couldn't get the hang of it. This book helped quite a bit, although I think the writing would be a bit confusing for younger players. It gives good tips and strategies as well as some known and some not known cheats. I was finally able to send my ""son"" off to college, get on the dean's list and graduate without being placed on probation or getting expelled. It made the game more enjoyable."
4,Don't Buy Both - Wasting Simoleans,"This is a good overall book for understanding how to play the game. Don't make my mistake though. I bought the Sims 2 and the Sims University Cheat Books. Sims University comes with a bonus copy of the Sims 2 book in it. So it was a waste of money to buy both. Save and just buy the Sims University Cheat Book. Also, don't expect a lot of cheat codes, and if you know how to play already, a lot of the info in here is redundant or can be discovered in the first hour of game play."
4,Good guide,This is a good guide for Sims 2. I have never played so this was quite helpful in getting me started and will be even more so once I get into the game. There is a lot of information though and it is difficult to find the answer to any one particular question without going through page after page. Perhaps with more use I will be able to find what I need quickly. Otherwise it would have been five stars.
4,Worth buying.,"This is better value than other Prima strategy guides as it is actually a guide for both Sims University and for Sims 2.... however it's not such good value if you've already bought the original Sims 2 book.Prima, as ever, have packed a lot of information into their book and it is stuffed to the gills with useful tips and ideas. It gives a rundown on what your adolescent Sims need in order to survive, and ultimately graduate from college whilst still managing to party hard and have a good time. There are details on the new features to be found and goodies to be bought as well as a useful list of careers and what is needed to reach the top of career ladder.The original guide, which is included here, gives a useful run down on playing the game and provides lots of additional information for the budding architect making building a lot simpler. Even the die-hard Sims player is sure to find new ideas and helpful advice in this book, it's worth every penny."
4,INDEX TOO!!!,"Ok, im a mac user so i don't even have this game yet. BUT IT WILL BE OUT VERY SOON!!! but i did play this game @ my friends house, and this guide was quite helpful. Plus, for those of us that have macs (and are sims 2 freaks) will enjoy just reading about sims 2 university (fantasizing; if only i had sims 2 university). This book has all the little tips and tricks you need to know, true, you could just find it all scattered across the web. But its always nice to have all the answers in the palm of your hand (those of us who have really big hands). AND WITH A INDEX TOO!!!."
1,How?,How can you spend your money on something so worthless? You can buy the game The sims1 for this price. worthless...
4,Prima Does It Again,"I just got this book today and it's almost 400 pages long. I must say it really does help a lot. I did say that you didn't really need a strategy guide for a game like this but I may have been wrong. The book explains everything in detail and it does so in an easy to read font and FULL COLOR. I do recommend this guide only because The Sims 2 is a lot more advanced, complicated and harder to grasp at times. Just brezze through it if you have to as a refrence or read it from beginning to end. Your choice. Either way, you'll have hours of enjoyment from both."
1,Not worth the money,"This book is not worth twenty bucks. Most of the book is taken up by a reprint of the original Sims2 guide. They did not even bother to correct the errors (of which there were plenty) in the original guide before simply reprinting it and selling it all over again. The part of the guide that is actually about University is sparse, leaves out too many details, and only takes up a few dozen pages. You can find all the information they have in there (and MORE) by doing a google search on Sims2 University. Trust me. Save your money."
1,Forget it!,"What a total disappointment. It's too bad that Prima thinks that they can put about 100 pages of University information together with 300 pages of a repeat of the Sims2 guide and expect us to pay $19.99 for it. This is one comsumer who's walking away. I have the Sims2 guide already, I'm not forking out more for a piddly amount of information on the new expansion pack. I'll spend the time searching the fan sites for what I need to know. And you can bet I let all my Sim buds know- don't bother with this book UNLESS you don't already have the Sims2 guide. If Prima wises up and prints guides of just the expansion packs- I'll be the first to buy. Otherwise, forget it."
5,A Very Helpful Guide,"I was very happy with this guide because it explains almost everything in the game! It gives helpful tips that I never would have thought about otherwise. I've heard that it doesn't have a table of contents, but it does on the page right before part one begins. It is in the small print. Overall, I am very happy with this 366-paged, full color guide"
5,"Great book, has all you'll probably ever need!","Well, the title says it all! The Sims 2 would have been much more challenging (not necessarily a bad thing) without this book. And it was cheap, too (gift certificate). For that Sim Addict in your family, I have to recommend this guide! It's great!"
3,So-so,"If the book had an index I would have given it 5 stars, but as is I find myself flipping through the book back and forth looking for the answer to my question.I actually sat down one day and started to read it cover to cover but never finished. Who wants to ""study"" for a game?"
5,Perfect fit,"These refills are the exact refill to fit 1969 amc amx factory trico wiper blades, could not be more pleased!"
2,not what you see,"I was disappointed in the product-the Teddy Bear and Block are cheap looking-roses are larger than expected, also pink,red, and white-not as pictured-tower was also flattened due to shipment packing. I had intended to use this for baby shower, will not be.Too bad-it could have been lovely."
5,great collaboration!,"The fruits of tape trading between Acid Mothers Temple shaman & the adventurous minimalist composer, this album's five untitled tracks are immensely listenable. The first is beautiful and optimistic (surprising in the experimental genre, where art damage is the order of the day and debasement is the name of the game): Youngs' strong tenor intones, ""You're so much better now,"" and ""There's so much beauty now"" while acoustic guitars chime and a shimmering sea of drone slowly builds in the background. The remaining tracks are all instrumental. Tracks 2, 4 & 5 embed a beautiful acoustic guitar melody in gauzy layers of drone. Track 3 is more aggressive, an extended drone piece that reminds you just who these two cats are, though still in keeping with the mindtrip nature of the music. Transporting & transcendent."
3,weak,"One would think there'd be little reason for a bad review of compressed air but the ""straws"" on these cans are too narrow in diameter and produce a very weak air jet. With the straws off they are typical compressed air canisters and are fine."
5,Not as greaat as Riverdance and Lord of the Dance but music's still good.,"Although the music's doesn't compete with Riverdance, let alone ""Lord of the Dance"" this is still filled with lovely songs once again great music. ""Timedance"" and ""Chetvorno Horo"" are my favorite songs, but I also like ""Mystic Seacliffs"" and ""Bridge Attack"" and of course, ""Women of the Sidhe"" from Riverdance. It's all pretty good music, and if you like Riverdance, then well, enjoy"
5,Gloucester 42,"This is not just an excellent read it is a great ""reference"" work. For those who have any of Joel Whitburn's tomes this is a fine complementary book. Who knew that Phil Spector's most successful song as a producer was ""My Sweet Lord/Isn't It A Pity"" while John Mellencamp's ""Pink Houses"" turned out to be only his 9th best seller.For those who are into this kind of ""info""-don't take this too seriously-there are about another million similar bits in this book. I use it often."
3,Great Lists,"Great lists of music, especially the decade. The way some of the data is compiled (by calendar year) skews a lot of the data. There should be a list of singles and artists with points total and # of weeks in top 100, top 40, top 10. that would help with the fact that you really explain the fact that not a single Beatles song made the top 50 (because they didn't live on the chart as long) while one-off's by Lee Ann Rimes placed super-high. I mean, I love ""How Do I Live?"" but it never even topped the charts. They should award bonus points for weeks at #1 and weeks in the top 10 maybe or something..."
5,Hours of info!!!,For any Billboard Chart enthusiest this is a great book. It is a great addition to Joel's other books.!!!
5,Bronson's Charts Smart!,"Fred Bronson has painstakingly compiled a chart lovers'companion filled with vital statistics, facts, and glorious pictures. What really sets this book apart is Mr. Bronson's seemingly unending wealth of often fascinating, and sometimes uncanny, chart revelations. Fred Bronson spins his tales of pop culture into gritty bites of timeless trivia. Highlights include The Top 100 Songs from Motion Pictures with fun anecdotes such as 1976 Romanian gymnast Nadia Comaneci's connection to the movies and The Top 100 Songs of 1963, the year before The Beatles broke and forever changed America's musical landscape.Many writers have created other chart compendiums of a similar nature, but no one tackles the Rock Era with the zest and creativity of a true chart champion and enthusiast quite like Fred Bronson."
3,tremendous album,This is the perfect album for the traditional gospel lover it will inspire you to love traditional gospel even the more. Good job on this project mr. branch and the singing stars. Hope to hear more from yall.
3,"A few great songs, but Wes has gone trivial","First off, I am a big fan of Wes King. His music/ministry has meant much to me over the years and his last album was one of the great Christian music CDs ever. That is why I am so very disappointed with this CD which he touts as ""a proverb"" to his sons - if that was his intent, he succeeded with three songs, failed miserable with three and knows about the other four?Several of the songs appear to be closer to Bob Carlisle than Wes King from a theological perspective (both lyric flow and content).Worth buying? Perhaps, but not if you are expecting a full CD of worthwhile, meaningfull songs."
4,Good Stuff For Argento Lovers,"i purchased this C.D. becuase I am a Goblin ""freak"" (ha-ha), and really wanted to see how the new group stacks up. I was not dissapointed! The songs featured on this disc are quite good, with the smooth Goblin style very much in evidence. In addition to the hard to find stuff(the ""Killer,Killer"" theme from Demons,for example), there's the usual haunting themes that by now are very much old favorites, such as Suspiria's main theme, tracks from Deep Red,and a great alternate theme from Tenebrae. Highly recomended."
3,"Not much to say, really.","I bought this to have a matching set with my Volume II.Decent enough for reference, but that's about it.Yeah...that's about it."
2,"Works OK, but keep your laptop plugged in","I've used a couple different types of these USB to serial converters and this is the first one that doesn't work when my laptop is on battery power. If this functionality is important to you, buy a different converter."
2,Incorrect label,I purchased the Sabrent USB-Serial under the impression that it was a FTDI chip. When it arrives I find that it is Prolific (nice and cheap). The Prolific have flakey drivers based on past experience which is why I was hoping for the FTDI. Luckily the prolific driver seems to work. (I have many USB-Parallel Prolifics that dont.)
2,doesn't work with a macbook,This cable will not work with the macbook I have running 10.6.2. It came with the drivers on a mini cd which won't work with the macbook's internal drive anyway. I tried both the stock drivers on my laptop as well as the ones downloaded off of their site. I noticed after purchasing this cable unfortunately that one of the other reviews mentions it not working for them when their system is running on its battery. I haven't tried plugging my laptop in to get it to work as the situations I will need this cable in may not have extra power available for me to plug my laptop in.
3,Good for the price,The cable works well for at least Windows XP and did the trick for allowing me to connect to the serial port of a Sun server via USB. The description indicates that it provides drivers for Windows Vista but there are no drivers on the disk provided that will install. Prolific drivers only does OEM so will not provide drivers directly to the end user. The Vista drivers appear to be available on the Sabrent website at http://www.sabrent.com/products/index.htm although I haven't tried them yet. There also appear to be some MAC drivers that weren't on the vendor media.
1,Cable does not work.,"We decided to try this cable because we needed the serial port on an Apple computer, but we should have heeded what other people said. This cable does not work. I recommend against purchasing one."
1,Pokemon battery operated toothbrush,"I, nor my son was impressed with this $10 (plus shipping) toothbrush. It is hard to manuver around when you have to hold down a ""plate"" to operate. It is inevitable that it will turn off 100 times during your recommended ""2 minute"" brush time."
4,Classic Marley,"The reviews for this product are pretty pitiful. Don't look at the aggregate stars for this product, it has been brought down by reviewers who 1) are complaining about shipping TWICE and 2) wrote something incoherent.Bob Marley is a legend. That said, this is missing a lot of Marley's best songs. Get 'Legend' instead."
5,Slumping,This album is slumpnig don't listen to that scrap cry baby if you like woodie and you a norteno buy this.14 4 Life
1,ANTIOCH 13 X3 L.M.T Cry-Baby,"First of all what makes this cd so bad is he doesn't even live the life he's promoting.Yeah he's a chap, oh a mera vista Chap.L.M.T BABY Cry- Baby..Don't help him by buying this.Pick up Lil Rob,Lil Blacky and south siders chapter 13.."
3,Demonz in my sleep,This has to be the least threatening rap cover I have ever seen. He looks like he is totally ready to handle tax season - biiaatch! I would not be surprised if he dropped mad deductions on the IRS ~ Representtttt!!!!! I wouldn't even be scared if he was carring a chinese guy with a machete and chicken flu towards me.
2,I've seen better.,"A true Wushu has a heavy handle (usually metal) and the blade will bend all the way to the hilt without breaking. This one will only bend about 1/2 way and then you have a ""warped"" blade. Also, the zippers on the case were broken when I received my package. For ""show"" and not actual battle this is a good buy... it's ""pretty""."
5,Very interesting aspect of social history,"If you're looking for an interesting book about social history in the United States, take a look at this book. A lot of the book asks very personal question like, ""what is obscenity? can a society define morality?The book also can easily be connected with things that are happening today, birth control availability in high schools, for example.It's a very interesting read."
4,clear and practical,"Above all, this book is clear and practical; it provides very specific techniques to help alleviate depression. I especially like the suggestions for uncovering and clarifying our most deep-seated beliefs (core beliefs)---the beliefs which are an integral part of depression. I also think the emphasis on the need to enter into the physical reality of our experience, via mindfulness techniques, is a welcome addition to the psychological approach of cognitive therapy. By giving equal emphasis to the mindfulness and cognitive therapy approaches, the authors offer powerful tools for living more awake and free."
2,Disappointing,"Having read Zindel et al. MBCT for Depression, I was interested in reading a version for clients and laypeople. Unfortunately, this book is very superficial compared to the theory outlined in Zindel. Not helpful for me."
1,You get what you pay for.,"I bought this mouse less than six months ago, and before I'd even had it a couple of months the cursor had started jumping around my screen, I can't control where it goes half the time, and the wheel doesn't scroll well. It's like I don't even have a wheel. Also, a newer problem is that after I've stopped scrolling (or zooming), several minutes after I've stopped, the screen will scroll or zoom by itself, because the wheel isn't reading right. It's torture to use this mouse. I'm ordering a different one from a different company, and I will never ever buy another mouse from Compucessory.Considering I only paid about $10 for it, you can sort of expect to have problems. But for a mouse to become unusable after less than six months of normal every-day use, that's just pathetic."
4,What is Teenage Romance?,"This book is all about what life is like for a teenager. It gives you those embarassing moments plus what to do about them. I wouldn't take any of the advice seriously, but it's a great thing to read! It also proves that you can overcome anything you wish as a teenager. However, it also helps teenagers to see how obsessed they are with image. If you are a teenager, I highly recommend this book. If not, you'll still get a good laugh."
4,Maelo's swansong.,"A likable album by Ismael Rivera who was past his prime. But don't be fooled! What he lacked in vocal range at this point, he made up in feeling and soul. It is still a joy to listen and reminisce. He is sorely missed.Good remastering and informative liner notes round up this fine offering."
3,music,The box of the CD was broken fortunely the disc was ok but could recive a sratch easily and that is unascceptable.
2,Very basic material,"If you just want to improve your breathing to a good basic level and want a ""vanilla"" reading, this is a good book. I finished it in less than a day and the real important tips can probably be sumarized in a couple of pages. For intermediate levels try ""Power Breathing"" by Sang Kim or to really go deep, try ""Refining the Breath"" by Doug Keller"
3,Very short book - more of an article,"This is not really a book - its a long article and that too not very long. Author spends half of the very short book talking about importance of breathing. I would have though liked some scientif references.In short, this is good stuff but not worthy of being called a book. I don't regret paying $4 for this book but I do feel short-changed after reading the 'whole book' in 15-20 minutes.Most of the informaton contained in the book can be found in public domain if you like searching the internet."
2,Don't Bother,"If you have a book or article that describes the Yoga Complete Breath, you have most of the content of this book."
5,Another Page Turner from Margaret Miles,"No Rest for the Doves was a fun read. I have read the other three books in this series, and this one was my favorite. I became immersed in the rich and wonderful details of colonial New England. It was truly a ""who done it"" and kept me turning pages when I should have been turning out the light. The protagonist, Charlotte Willett, is a woman to reckon with. She is smart . She is pretty. She can cook a delicous meal from an old hamhock hanging in a cold cellar, iceskate across a frozen river wearing heavy skirts and cloaks, milk cows and create chesses and coddled creams and carry on intelligent conversations with the most educated men. To top if off, she is always one step ahead of everyone else. I can't wait to find out what she does in the next book."
3,"Interesting historical detail, but uninteresting characters","This is the second Bracebridge mystery I've read, and it will probably be the last. The historical detail in the books are fascinating; readers will pick up a lot of information about the politics of the day, what people wore, and how they lived. Still, the characters lack depth and are very predictable."
2,1.5 stars if it was available... and I'm a charismatic!,"I'm a charismatic and want to agree with Pinnock, but he is just wrong on too many issues. I am grateful for other Charismatic teachers who find more solid grounds to stand on. Much of Pinnock's work is man-centered and subjective. He doesn't even seem to be ""evangelical"" on the authority of Scripture issue, rather speculating on many things without authentic concern for what the Bible says. It seems he is more interested in considering the human perspective rather than God's perspective, which is the Bible. If you want a better charismatic AND biblical perspective on the Holy Spirit look for systematic theologies by Wayne Grudem, J. Rodman Williams, or D. Martyn Lloyd-Jones. Pinnock's book isn't worth the harm it can cause, unless you're looking for the god he's painting a picture of... a god void of many Scriptural attributes."
4,Considering spending seven months of your life in a grueling endeavour?,"Read this book first. For one thing, someone considering a thru hike of one of the three major north/south trails of America has to decide which one, or at least which one first. This book provides a general overview of the those three trails, but in itself will not be sufficient to plan any of them. That's not a fatal flaw in that when you actually get ready to plan a specific trip, you would want to buy a single book dedicated to that hike that you could carry with you the whole of the trip.Really, my only criticism of it is that I wish it had more photos. Most of those that are in here are grainy black and whites that just don't do justice to their subject matter. I would have paid double for something a little more photo journalistic."
5,For the dreamer,Excellent book for anyone planning a long distance hike or for anyone who dreams of adventure. Provides great background information of all three trails. A must read.
4,"Fast shipper, as described","Fast shipper, as described Fast shipper, as described Fast shipper, as described Fast shipper, as described Fast shipper, as described . .g g g."
2,SUPER salty!,"These have really increased in salt over the years - I've been using them occasionally for about 20 years now and after buying them for a quick dinner, that certainly won't be happening again! The salt, UGH! May as well go to the ocean and swallow a mouthful, or even the Dead Sea. I don't normally buy prepackaged items like this because of all the preservatives, but this one is quite ridiculous. It would really be nice if someone could invent a prepackaged item like this without all the salt and whatever else you don't recognize on the label! It's just SO unhealthy for kids and adults, especially those with high blood pressure. PLEASE, we're busy moms. SOMEONE invent something that's quick, easy, and HEALTHY! Can't recommend this one - I was asked to not buy them again from a family of hungry boys. You know, that says about everything!"
3,scalloped potatoes,I have found that this product has either increased the salt content or I have become very sensitive to OVERSALTING. I will watch the labeling to see if they reduce- but probably will not use betty croker box products again.
4,"Dont get angry about privacy violations, fight back",J.J. Luna provides great tips for protecting your privacy- charles
5,works on several levels,"This is a well-written, entertaining, and useful book for anyone in the modern society of snoops. The hardcore privacy protectors will find practical advice, but so will the more casual reader who merely wants to defend a little of his precious privacy."
3,Not all it claims to be,"I bought this book a few weks ago and I found it lacking certain key elements like clarity and detail. 90% of it consists of made up anectdotes that have no real point. If you want to get an idea of what you need to do to become invisible, buy this book. But don't expect to walk away from knowing HOW to do it. I would compare this book to a college textbook: all theory, with no practical advice. Buy it as a means to familiarize yourself with the many techniques of financial invisibility, then buy a book that will actually tell you how."
5,Choose Your Privacy,"It's ironic that as much as we lament our loss of privacy,often times we inadvertantly invite it or even outrightgive it away in exchange for the chance at a drawing for aprize. This book will make you realize a greater degreeof privacy is attainable. You can choose a few ideas orlive like a hermit.This is the best book I've read on Privacy."
5,The plant camellia sinensis,"The book ""Tea Chings"" is very informative specially for not a tea lover. I am a coffee lover but knowing more about 'teas' and its virtues changed my mind. I bought it as a gift to someone who loves tea and I am sure she will enjoy it as much as I did. It is a great gift and very affordable."
5,The first modern Army,"Richards provides an excellent account of the Landsknecht mercenaries of the renaissance in this work. I particularly enjoyed his section on the structure of a Landsknecht regiment and the officers that led it- the roles of the nachrichter and hurenweibel were quite amusing. Richards certainly proves in this work that the Landsknechts were the first to make use of a modern regimental structure. He also goes into vivid detail describing the Landsknecht costume. I have only one major complaint- Richards spends almost no time in detailing the weapons of the Landsknecht or their battle tactics. He does briefly mention (in the caption of an illustration), the significance of the katzbalger, a Landsknecht's favourite sword, and in his colour plates displays the tactics of a regiment during a battle, but he doesn't write much on either subject. Nonetheless the book was very enjoyable, and worth buying if you're keen on the subject."
4,Durable and easy to use,"I bought this machete to replace a cheaper 18 inch one I'd used for years. This machete is terrific for cutting vines in deep brush. The blade doesn't rust easily if cleaned after use, holds an edge, and doesn't bow out when used for chopping, unlike the thinner, cheaper ones on the market. The best feature is the rubberized handle, which helps reduce shock to the hand and improves grip. The only drawback is that it doesn't come with a sheath, which I had to buy separately. The cardboard packaging will keep the blade safe for a while, in the trunk of your car, for example, but it won't last forever."
1,"Four strokes, one broken machete","I lost my old machete with enclosed handle that had been used for years. So I went to Home Depot and bought what they had, which appears to be this Corona model. I started cutting side limbs off bamboo, a standard job in our yard. After three of four strokes the Chinese ""hardened steel for long life"" blade broke in two and the detached end bounced close to my leg."
1,No good for the money,Bought better at Wall mart for less money this is totally dull had to sharpen with file! Does not keep a good edge. I do not like it I am looking for a real Machete.
1,Wrong description,"The product description said carbon steel, but mine came labeled 'stainless steel'. And of course it was made in the big ""C""."
2,"So so, ok","Andre Watts is a gifted pianist ; and this recording might be an exception, or perhaps the music did not speak to him.I thought I heard the most boring La Campanella, the piece that usually brings tears to my eyes, the harmonic progressions in this bravura music really give me goosebumps. Watts' interpretation sounds sort of thin, short on bells, actually, no fireworks, no champagne in his music. He hit a couple of wrong notes in la Campanella and took a wrong accord in La Chasse. I don't mind the wrong notes, Rubinstein had plenty of them, it just did not sound like the Liszt I am used to listening. From the contemporaries, I like Kissin. I guess it is a matter of taste."
5,Joe Alessi Succeeds Again!,"Joseph Alessi has proven himself to be accomplished in all musical styles on this fantastic album. ""Improvisation No. 1"" (Enrique Crespo) is my absolute favorite of those listed on this album. A Grade 7/virtuoso piece, it demands many unusual techniques and effects. It is a contemporary work, but can't be written off as ""one of those weird contemporary pieces"" because it makes as much musical sense as anything by Mozart or Beethoven. It contains every extreme: fast and slow, soft and loud, rhythmic music and recetative candenza-esque sections. It is truly a must-hear for any lover of classical music, trombonist or otherwise."
5,Dog Beds,"After ordering, I received the beds within a couple of days. They were a hit with my dogs. I would welcome an opportunity to do business with this company again."
2,Good idea but not well made,"I bought this to use after hip replacement surgery. This is one of the items I took to the hospital with me. Unfortunately, when the physical therapist prepared the foot loop for my first use, we could see that the stritching was not secure and some stitches were broken. I managed to use it for a few days at the hospital and then a friend gave me another one that she does not use and that one was much better made."
5,Helpful aid for post-hip replacement patients,"Got this for my mother-in-law after hip replacement, helped her a lot moving her leg on and off her bed and for PT exercises. Thank you!"
