3,Fanboys,"Okay sure this will appeal more to Star Trek and Star Wars fans, and the ladies may find it a little gross at points, but overall it's a funny movie. Steven Spielberg put together a decent cast with a reasonably good story. Some friends that have been long time fans of Star Wars decide to take their dieing friend to raid George Lucas's Ranch. Along the way there are some hilarious incidents, the fights with the Star Trek fans being some of the best. Overall a decent guy movie that some ladies may find amusing as well. Good quality DVD with decent replayability. If you enjoyed this catchSpaceballs.CA Luster"
3,"Light humor, but true to Star Wars fans","Very short (only 1.5 hours). Funny, but not terribly so. Interesting idea for the plot. Though I enjoyed this film, it is not the best Star Wars-themed film out there; though technically not a ""film"", Robot Chicken's foray into the Star Wars universe was much, much better.If you're a Star Wars fan, you'll like this movie. It's worth the price you pay."
5,Funniest movie I have seen in a LONG time.,"Hands down, this was the most enjoyable movie I have seen in a long time. As a late 30 something, I grew up on Star Wars and remember the hype and remember the hype for the new movies in the late 90s. I watched this on my dvd player on the plane and laughed out loud to myself many times and couldn't wait to tell everyone I've ever known about this and I'm not usually a gusher about a movie. Anyhow, its an enjoyable little romp that has a bunch of great cameos. It was hilariously funny, but also had a lot of heart which is what made it all come together. I can't recommend this movie ENOUGH!"
2,Too crude to fully enjoy,"As a huge Star Wars fan and general geek, I enjoyed a lot of things about the main story. However, the unrelenting stream of vulgarity finally overwhelmed the fun for me, not unlike when your toilet backs up and finally spills over onto your floor.This movie deserves an R rating for its large quantity of bad language, sexual references, drug use, and other ""mature"" elements. I wish it had been rated R, so I would have known that offensive content would make it not worth watching. I certainly wouldn't recommend this movie for anyone under 17. However, it seems aimed at Gen Y types who I presume have been desensitized to such things by media like this movie."
4,it's a hoot,"some cool covers and neat originals by a Japanese psychedelic 60's band. they actually sing ""right my fire"". pretty sure it's tongue in cheek, cuz then they sing it correctly. also white rabbit, somebody to love, and San Franciscan nights. a bit eclectic for sure."
3,"good case, bulky clip","The case looks good, and protects the screens and number keys. The plastic covering is a bit loose and produces glare over the screens. Something more elastic might have been better. The clip, which rotates and can be removed, it very bulky."
5,Great case for the price,"The cell case came quicker than expected and was exactly what I wanted. Real leather, fit perfectly, good clip."
4,OK case,"Does an excellent job of protecting the phone & it's easy to use. Phone, camera, etc. is fully functional while in the case. Good belt clip. A little bulky, and I don't like the 2 piece design."
1,Not as depicted!,"The item I received was not what's illustrated on the web page. What I got was not an ""Avanti"", but a ""Platinum"", and for the v710 only. I realize the two are similar, but it didn't really fit my e815, with the holes in poor alignment. It may be fine for a v710, but again, it's not as depicted and is a poor fit for an e815. Pass it by."
3,Works as well as any,"I have had the E815 phone for almost two years now. This style case is commonly available under several different brands. The clip is a poor design that stretches out in about 2 to 3 months. The piece that goes into the clip and is attached to the case will last 4 to 6 months. Therefore, I will have used about 4 extra clips and 4 complete cases in the course of two years. Hopefully when my contract runs out, I can find a phone with a better case design."
1,Bicycle Casino,"Previous editions of Bicycle Casino were far better than this one. The cards are so small, they are difficult to see. Too much effort was put into showing various LasVegas scenes that have nothing to do with this game."
2,Mediocre stooges' films,"This tape was pretty weak. However, there was one short that could have made it much better... A PAIN IN THE PULLMAN!"
5,"WHOOPS,I'M A STOOGE!!","This tape has three of their better shorts.In particular,i like how BUD JAIMSON got alot of screen time in this one.If your like me,you'll know that bud jaimson is one of the best stooge supporting players along with VERNON DENT.Also,if your a true stooge fanatic like i am you'll know who these fine actors were."
2,Pretty weak tape.,"A pretty weak tape. WHOOPS, I'M AN INDIAN is too boring for my likes. The short goes into too many different plots. The only highlight for me is the scene where the canoe appears to be jet propelled. ROCKIN' THRU THE ROCKIES was actually pretty good. The scene with the bear was funny, and so was the fishing scene. A funny short. CACTUS MAKES PERFECT was just too slowly paced for my likes. The scene where Moe is stuck goes on too long.Notice that all three of these shorts take place in the forest, where the Stooges meet indians."
4,HEY !!!,"Hey, you should not be reading this if you've still got not THE UNEXPECTED GUEST. RUn and buy it before it goes out of catalogue again. This is the source of inspiration for so many American bands: the new wave of British heavy metal. DEMON was unlucky to choose so bad a name for their band (I mean, people have prejudices against a name like that), and later they lost momentum after releasing weak album THE PLAGUE. But this one here contains the astonishing Don't Break the Circle and other metal gems."
2,"superb singer, lame band","I started off with Demon's third album ""The Plague"", which I really like because of its diversity and well-written songs. The first problem with Demon is that the drummer sounds uninspired and monotonous and that you can hardly hear the bass player. The second problem is that writing a whole album about summoning up ghosts and the dangers involved can get a bit naive or childish as is the case with this one. Lines that go like: Toootal possessiooon, I think he's possessed ! illustrate the mediocrity of the lyrics... Dave Hill is a great singer though and only his voice saves the band. The guitars are very predictable and every song sounds like the other. As stated before ""The Plague"" is so much better on all levels and it shows that these guys can be captivating."
2,Opera-ish,"I'm working my way through the Classical section at my library. This was filed under Axelrod and was thus one of the first CDs I brought home. It wasn't what I was expecting.The music style is similar to Opera, but not as good. The tracks are short and there are only 12 of them, so it makes for a very short CD. The cover art is beautiful, though!"
2,A Great Value???,"I had watched one of these video magazine episodes a few years back and liked it, but now it just seems to be a string of advertisements with clips of snowboarding in between."
5,An unusual and worthwhile read,"As baseball books go, this one is unusual. Instead of mimicking the tried-and-true journalistic voice of authority, the author lets his subject do most of the talking, about baseball in general and the Red Sox in particular, as well as on things that have little to do with sport but are nonetheless interesting, such as the Ramsey murder, life in the Army during the Vietnam era, race, and psychology. In one lengthy passage, the author uses old and new James analysis to make a case for Lou Whitaker being severly underrated and having had more value to his teams than Ernie Banks or Lou Brock to theirs. Whether you agree or disagree, or you like Bill James or don't, this book is pretty fascinating. Some reviewers have complained about the structure, but I found it a fun and easy read. If you're a Red Sox fan, you'll dig the ""Pedro Martinez / London pub"" story."
4,Bill James,Interesting book. Gives some insight into who Bill James is and what he has written and impact on Baseball and writing.
2,Just read Bill James himself...,"This book could have been titled ""The Best of Bill James"" instead of ""The Mind of Bill James."" About 70% of the book is just excerpts from old publications of James', often inserted without any real context or additional insight. Gray, when he appears, is a decent writer but not a great one, and I agree with an earlier reviewer who said that his writing style often seems derivative of James himself.Fun in parts, but poorly edited, disorganized, and ultimately a very sparse book."
2,"Wanted to like it, but in the end couldn't","I'd already read Moneyball, and turned to this book hoping for some more details. They're not here. The biography chapters are pretty boring; so far as I can tell from the book, Bill James isn't that personally interesting a guy, and Gray isn't that engaging a writer. But I wasn't looking for James's biography so much as for an account of his ideas. (That's why I bought a book called ""The MIND of Bill James""!) But it was all pretty thin. The appendix, which contains brief presentations of several of James's more influential ideas, was the most promising part of the book, but it was far too rushed. What I realized I wanted after reading this book was a good anthology collecting several of James's essays that are still relevant. I haven't seen that book yet, but I'll probably buy it if it comes out."
3,Great content - lacks role playing activities,Teacher's book (Lesson Planner) is owesome. However the student book lacks activities for students to work in pairs/role playing dialogues. That really sucks because if you don't create those activities by yourself you are going to have much more TTT than STT.
1,Be carefulmou get the current version,The one i bought on amazon was an old version. I had to return it and buy off ebay. I am sure his book is well done though.
4,An impressive shaver,"I have been using several Norelco triple header models for many years. This is a great improvement. My shaving needs are a little unusual: I shave my neck and my head, but I have a beard. The coarse hairs on the back of my head are difficult to shave by any means, including a wet razor. But this shaver gets it smooth if I persist. The shaver is easy to use and easy to clean. I like the wet shave option, but in reality it works just as well dry. I have had no skin irritation, even with the first use. This shaver is highly recommended."
2,Poor value for your money,"The 8092 gave me the best shave of any electric razor I have tried, especially when you use foam. Which is why I have owned three of these!The first one a gift from my girlfriend and I was hooked. Around the six month mark it just stopped working. So I bought a second one and it broke down in the same way - just stopped working. But I was addicted to the shave so paid for another one and lo and behold it broke down last week. I had enough. The shave is great but not good enough to justify the high cost and short life. I'm going back to Remington.If you're rich and you can afford to buy a new one every few months go for the 8092. Otherwise look elsewhere."
2,"Good ""wet"" shaver, awful when dry","You'd think that for this much you could buy a decent shaver. When wet, this shaver really excels. It's smooth, it cuts close to the skin, and the results are great. That said, if I wanted wet, I'd use razors instead. When dry, however, the shaver is just awful. It doesn't give you that close a shave, has issues with hairs on the neck that go almost parallel to the skin (won't pick them up) and sometimes it catches hair in it and pulls it, which is very unpleasant. It just reminded me why I hate electric razors so much, and being a personal hygiene item, it's not something I can return.Two stars for wet shave only. It'd be one star otherwise."
4,"Good shaver, problematic charger","This is a truly great shaver, one of best shavers I've ever used. The problem is the charger/cleaner. In just over a year, it's malfunctioned a number of times, although the warranty did cover it for a year."
1,Unreliable,"I have been using Panasonic wet/dry shavers since 1991 when I switched from Braun to Panasonic. I've owned just about every high end model Panasonic came up with during that period as I typically change shavers once a year. I was initially very happy with this model it used to give me a nice smooth shave and I like the fast recharge time. I had a been using it a little over 6 months when it started malfunctioning. It shuts down within minutes of a full recharge and during the few minutes it's working it doesn't seem to be operating at full power. I am very disappointed and would not recommend it because of its unreliability. You'd be better off with one of the simpler, cheaper and more reliable models."
2,Lasted only for a year,"I bought the ES8092 NC on December 2003 with confidence that this will be the best shaver I will ever have. Two weeks ago, it died on me. Warranty is only 1 year. Called Panasonic Headquarters, sent them email too but could not do anything about it. I will never purchase this again."
2,Not as good as the old design like Panasonic ES8086...,"For a shaver that costs nearly $120.00, I expect it to be great. But the performance of this shaver is very disappointing. I still have the old Panasoncie ES8086 at home, it shaves far faster and closer than this new ES8092. If you shave dry, it is even worse. If you expect sonic shaving, forget about it. It is more like slow mo for this ES8092. Take my advice for real, buy something else that can really shave away your beard in a flash. It just too damn slow."
4,Replacements,best place for replacements is from the manufacturer. they always have heads and foils in stock. Same goes for all electric razors. I see so many people looking for razor heads or cleaning solutions and yet they always forget about the manufacturer sells the things they are looking for!
2,Higher Price= Better Shaver,"I bought this shaver thinking I would get a closer, faster shave but it did not deliver as expected. I have to say I put it up against a much cheaper rotary shaver and the rotary was just as good if not better. If you skip a day, and then try to use this razor, it and you will have a hard time of it. I use it in the car, on the way to work most often because it takes so long to get a good shave out of it. As for the build, it is excellent but efficiency is lacking. As for the wet feature what guy is shaving in the shower, give me a break and it does not better wet then dry? Note: William' Lectric Shave, is a must use pre-shave, if you can stand the stink and chemicals. I wash my face after using Lectra Shave and I would suggest that to anyone, check the ingredients."
1,Not worth $1.24 never mind $124,I bought this razor for my grandfathers 85th birthday. He had tried several razors that he wasn't happy with and with his hands growing more unsteady each year he did not want to continue using a standard blade. He hated it. Kept saying it didn't cut good. I tried it on my next visit and was surprised to find that he was nottttttt mistaken. I took it and told him I would exchange it for another knowing perfectly well I couldn't get my money back. I tried wet and dry for a couple weeks and was totally disapointed. This coming from a man that can use a 50 cent disposable for two weeks before it gets dull. I have a 10 year old norelco that works 10x better. I bought him a new norelco and he is completly satisfied :) I tried switching the blades around on this thing but no good. Maybe I just got a defective one or something. I cant believe this is what $124 buys. LOL
3,Looks great but shave is just OK.,I bought this razor to replace an inexpensive Remington I've had for years. I thought the idea of shaving in the shower sounded good and would cut down on the dust created from shaving with the Remington. I've had it for over a year and I've never gotten a really complete shave with it. I use the Remington to finish or just a regular razor.I think the Panasonic quality is first rate....however the performance does not justify the price.
1,Vornado filters-do not buy-it's a BIG MESS,The Vornado works sensationally for the first 2 or 3 days. Then the filter paper dries up and accumulates water contaminants. Even with filtered water the filter'S lifespan only increases to about 12 days. This means new filterS every 2 weeks which is approximately $... Plus the filter SMELLS BAD by this point as well as the humidified air.I have already spent $... in filter costs. It seems like a scam so that you can continue to keep spending lots of $$$$ on Vornado products....
1,Sanyo Xacti Junk,"I bought a Sanyo Xacti. This ended up being the the worst camera purchase. The screen that folds out is a faulty design. It will fail, just depends on when. Our Xacti happened to fail the second day into our trip to Europe. For the $350 dollars we spent on this camera you would expect a better product, we bought it because it was the ""Editors Pick"" in Wired. It wasn't even a week old, and then to repair it was gonna cost $200 dollars, to which i have found other forums saying it would still fail again, sometimes within the first week of getting it back. The customer service is horrible, everything about Sanyo is a waste of money. Look at a Canon or Panasonic camera cause you will only be disappointed with this junk."
4,Great Fun Camera,"Camera works great. Underwater option is amazing. Easy fast download to my mac and youtube. I would say the only small issue is that it is not super clear, but for a fun all purpose camera that goes underwater it is more than clear enough."
3,Handy but poor quality stills,"This camera is uncomfortable to hold, making it hard to hold still. The still photos are okay (and only okay) out in the sunlight but in any other surrounding the photos are pretty rotten. Changing settings didn't help much. Red eye is the worst I've ever seen in any camera. Still, it is fun to jump in the rapids while filming and the super macro focus is handy. The small size and dual use are the main attraction for this camera. It serves a purpose but keep another camera for the still photos that really matter."
2,defected image,"It is a nice camcorder. But for $400, I expected a reasonable quality. There is a white spot in all images or videos I took. I remembered one previous review mentioned about this issue. He did an exchange, and still have the same issue.Also, the navigation button is too small. It is hard not to accidentally hit the wrong button. Another previous review also mentioned this problem.The image is ok if the light is good. Otherwise, the 6m (10m as claimed) is worse than my 3m Olympus.Also, the focus is also kind of slow. If the subject has a sudden move, it takes a noticeable time to focus. Again, for $400, it should have issues like this."
1,Broke after 2 years,"After two year's use, I opened it up to shoot and the Display was upside down with no solution to correct the issue. I'm not the only one who has had this problem according to web searches. Funny thing is Sanyo has not heard heard on this problem. The their site is not user friendly to ask how to resolve this issue. As for when the camera worked - the underwater images were fantastic. Just not worth the money to break after two years."
2,not an accessory,"It is great to have a camera that can be used for video and still shots. HOWEVER, my battery charger broke down after using only a few times. The item a lemon since I had only had the camera for 4 months. I called Sanyo asking for a free replacement since it had broken in less than a year. They said since it was an accessory, it was not under warranty so I would have to buy a new one. It is ridiculous to consider a charger as an accessory."
2,"Nice idea, poor ergonomics, and stopped working in four months","Nice, compact to carry around but really poor ergonomics. It is tough to hold it in a ""pistol"" grip and use the thumb to press the various buttons. My index finger almost always ends up over the lens.Kept it because I liked filming my kids under water occasionally. Should have sent it back as it stopped working after four months of limited use. I find out that they only have a 90 day labor warranty on this unit and I have to ship it from California to some ""TV Repair"" store in Illinois to get it fixed. It is now lying around in my junk bin. No thanks, I am not throwing good money after bad money.Unless you really need to shoot under water, stay away!"
4,Great Camera,"Pros: compact, great video quality, waterproofCons: poor audio quality, low battery lifeOther thoughts: I bought 5 additional batteries on eBay (for $20). The camera died while I was snorkeling, be very careful when you are using controls under the water. Anyway I'm very glad I bought this camera."
1,This is NOT waterproof!,"This was purchased December of 2007, it was used 3 times, and never submerged. I brought it to the lake and it was splashed a few times. I went to take a picture with it, and the view was all cloudy. I turned it around and there were water bubbles inside the lens! 3 days later the moisture remains, and there is no possible way to contact Sanyo from their website, or some place to send my camera to have it repaired. 380 dollars down the drain."
4,LOVE IT!!!,"I love the camara/video waterproof capabilites. It took fabulous videos and also 85% pictures. You have to practice to get yur best videos, but once you perfect it the videos are wonderful to have."
1,Bum Battery,"Camera had a bad battery. Never worked. Clearly, it wasn't tested before it was shipped. Very poor quality control. I think this will be my last Sanyo purchase."
1,Dead Camera,Camera died for no reason. Still trying to find out if it can be fixed. Buttons are too small for me so you want to be sure to have small fingers to be able to use it well. The lense has odd ratios so aspect is a bit unusual.
2,Video quality reminiscent of 1980s VHS,"Build quality is crisp and precise and the unit is attractive. Screen picture quality is average. Controls are surprisingly limited. But the biggest problem is the video quality. Connected to a TV, I was surprised to see that for shots taken both indoors and outdoors on a sunny day, greens looked oversaturated, outlines were blurry, and very noticeable digital artifacting occurred in images of a running child. Overall I was reminded of my first VHS camera circa 1983.For shooting underwater it's affordable and brilliantly small. Unfortunately I won't get that far as I'm returning it for picture quality reasons."
1,Do not buy******beware!!!! design flaw,"I purchased the Sanyo Xacti VPC-E1 6MP Waterproof... I really liked the product. Video and photo quality was very good...but there is a really bad design flaw...the cable that feeds the screen will FOR SURE go bad. This is a flat cable that lets you see what you will take a picture or video of. Without this screen your whole camera is worthless.****DO YOUR RESEARCH*******This flat cable WILL GO BAD and you will have a brick on your hand. The repairs are more expensive than buying a new camera. So you been warned!Do an internet search for ""problem SANYO Xacti VPC flat cable"" (without quotes) and you will see what I'm talking about.If you want a paper weight I got one at home!"
5,Dieses Buch ist ausgezeichnet!,"Dr. Graves did a fine job in putting together a clear, accessible guide to the grammar of the German language. The different points of grammar are presented in a manner that is very easy to understand and retain... I highly recommend it to anyone who is learning German, especially if you are studying it on your own."
4,Intriguing Plot,"I've recently discovered Linda Hall and am glad I did. Her plots are intiguing with surprise twists. This book was a quick read, just right for a relaxing weekend. I'm looking forward to more by this author."
5,Edge of your chair read!,"This author is so good. She keeps you on the edge of your seat as you read...in fact, very unlikely you can sleep until it's done."
1,The worst of the worst!,"This is possibly the worst V.C. Andrews book I have ever read (it and Cinnemon are in a close race), and it is definitely in the worst series. I don't know why I continue reading these mini-series books when I know they are all basically the same book rewritten with new characters. Like other Andrews characters, Rose has to deal with the death of a parent, the self-centeredness of another parent, and meeting relatives she never knew she had. Sounds really familiar, doesn't it? Unlike the original Andrews books, where the writing was so descriptive that I could almost feel like I was there living through the events along with the characters (and did not want to put the book down for anything), the new books are so bland that it is a chore just to finish one chapter."
1,Blah,"You know how some people say that 'so-and-so comes out smelling like roses', right? Not so for this book. Cinnamon and Ice were okay reads with bits of interest in them, but I don't know what book was worse, this one or Honey. This book just had such contrived twists and turns that in its own way, actually turned out to be rather predictable. So much is made of Rose's beauty, and the way she dances - the way she is described as dancing and feeling - are very cheesy and almost child-like. This book just doesn't work well in a series or on its own, it was just not very well-written."
1,Rosacea,"This book is a tease. It promised shocking secrets, incest, ruination, and then it never delivered. Better it never promised anything at all.And Rose is not that weird of a name. The way they talk about it you'd think the girl was named Rosacea."
1,What I've noticed...,"Hmmm...is it just me or are people reviewing these new books less than the older ones? I wonder why? Could it be that less people are buying her books now that they are beginning to suck? That has to be it. This book did stink. I didn't like it at all. Too boring and bland. In grocery stores, you know that you have Charmin toilet paper and then there's generic toilet paper (which is cheaper). You have the big, wonderful brand names (FITA and Heaven) and then there's this cheaper, not so great generic stuff (The Hudson series and the Shooting Stars). That's what I think. Not as good. These are cheap carbon copies of the better books. Kind of like K-mart clothes compared to Kohl's. K-mart is the cheaper stuff, while Kohl's is better quality. Catch my meaning? I didn't like this book at all, though. The Runaways and the books prior to that were by far better. Ever since the Wildflowers, I was turned off.Did you know that Keebler soda crackers taste better than Saltines?"
5,Highly recommended!,"If you can manage to get your hands on a copy of this book,grab it. I'm a great fan of Brin's ever since I read Sundiver 4 yearsago.This collection of short stories is both original and thought-provoking. He is one of a few writers that I have read who can delve into atmospheric theory, Greek legends, and some serious speculative stuff in one science fiction volume, and have it all come off as a cohesive volume of stories.If you're new to Brin, or if you're a seasoned fan, this book is worth reading 100%. Not as developed as his novels, but of course you can't expect that from short stories. Very satisfying read."
3,"Brin shows us his early work, good and bad.","One of the defining characteristics of science fiction as a genre is the ability to write stories that answer the questions ""what if?"" and ""why?"" Almost every one of the short stories in this collection evolves from one of these questions. Some of them, in particular the heavily awarded and thought provoking ""Crystal Spheres"", are well polished and enjoyable. Others, such as the abominable 250 word story, are obviously included because the author has a soft spot in his heart for them. Overall this collection is a good buy for those who are die-hard fans of the author himself, but I would have been happier if a number of the stories had been omitted and the book filled out with quality works from the latter part of Brin's career."
2,"nuh uh, no beats, no melodies, no nothing","This isn't a bad disc if you're a fan of beatless, melody-less ambient music. I am not which is why I gave this two stars (and returned it to the music store). Intriguing cover art and packaging but unfortunately that's the only interesting thing here. Pulseprogramming's tracks consists of slow waves of droning synth which lazily shifts tones and notes, kind of like listening to underwater recordings or white noise. Good for background music if you're meditating and occasionally an interesting bleep or blip will make an appearance. Overall, I found this to be a bit boring and not very meaty. It's missing substance, almost as if it's all surface with no depth. If you like beat oriented ambient this is not the disc for you."
3,Tie straps,"I use a lot of tie straps and needed some colored ones for I.D. These worked okay but they are narrow and not nearly as strong as ""regular"" tie straps. ""Cheap"" is the word that comes to mind. I wouldn't buy again."
5,Review,"Prompt service. Finally found the best RAZR pouch after AT&T quit selling them. Great price, too. (At&T ripped you off by charging $35 for one.)"
3,Not as described,"Seems to be a well made pouch, but does not have a magnetic closure as described. Instead it has a snap closure. I suppose time will tell with regard to the durability of that feature."
1,Does not meet expectations,"The fur on these boots does not look or feel real. The fur is not soft, and does not fluff up. I bought 2 pair for my daughters, one brown and one black. I am sending both back for a full refund. They looked a little big, too, but the girls didn't get a chance to try them on before I sent them back."
2,Effie tall boot disappointing,the faux fur was lighter than the picture and i didn't like how it felt. It felt very poorly made and not worth the price at all.
5,Always in my CD player,"I bought this CD without having heard any of the songs and has become one of my all-time favorites. The album overall has a very cool theme - life in the Southwest and how small town America has changed. The songs are great, some upbeat, some laid-back, all definitely worth hearing."
2,Good. Not Great.,"Don't get me wrong...I'm pleased with the CD, but I was expecting a Robt Earl Keen or Pat Green sound. This is much more laid back and at times reminds me of some slower George Strait. A good CD if that's what you're looking for. STILL BETTER THAN MAINSTREAM COUNTRY RADIO! By far."
4,EXCELLENT!!!,I really enjoyed this book. Although this book is for a more mature reader and you have to pay close attention to what you are reading so you do not get lost it is definitely a page turner.
1,Too many characters...,"This is one of the worst stories, I have tried to read this year. I was unable to finish this book. It was too many characters and not a story line to follow. Everyone woman is telling her story and I just couldn't get into it."
2,zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.................,This book was WACK. NOt at all what I was expecting the concept that it was supose to didn't turn out they way it should. DOn't waste your money buy a paper back or better yet a used it's not worth the money
3,Just okay,"These ""shims"" were rather expensive for what they are. And the plastic they are made from is very hard. I think they would be better if the plastic was little more rubbery."
4,fast drying choli,This is just like the stretch cotton cholis now so popular but it's made of nylon which means it dries FAST. That's useful if you're handwashing while traveling in India.
4,ALMOST as cute as the shorts,"The shorts to this matched set were so cute, that I had to go back and get the top. Nothing wrong with it, but the cut just wasn't as sexy. Still a very good product that will really turn on your boyfriend/husband. But few women would be daring enough to wear this out in public."
1,Worst FPS ive ever seen,"This is definately one of the worst FPS games ive ever seen. I spent $10 at best buy and probabaly got about 20 minutes of playing out of it before I threw it out the window. First of all It's got horrible graphics, there are invisible walls everywhere. Secondly you can only use muskets once, before you have to find a new one (the enemy uses it over and over again), or if you want to use the calvery sword you have to hit someone about 15 times by which time they have already killed you with there super fast reloading muskets. And lastly, the game is so short, in the 20 minutes I played it I beat the game. There are I think 5 easy levels. I think if you are going to spend $10 on a FPS save it until you have enough to buy Medal of Honor or Delta Force. Even to the biggest Cicil War fans. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!"
3,"If you are into the Civil War, this may not be a bad buy...","A Civil War buff myself, I've always wanted a first person shooter for the Civil War... and here it is! Although the music is annoying at best (5 sec. clip repeated over and over), I found if I popped in one of my Civil War music cd's as a substitute, the game still worked fine. The graphics are a bit weak, and it takes a bit of time to learn compared to other first person shooters, but it's a nice change from the ordinary. At Amazon.com zShop prices, this game is certainly worth the $3.50 plus shipping. However, I would avoid going to a retail shop and paying the list price of $20, you may be dissappointed."
3,A little aprehensive,"I keep seeing this game but the price is low, it just came out, and I don't know anything about it. I think I might wait a while before I go and buy this."
3,Learn Filipino,The book is very good and for being used it was in good condition but Amazon made a mistake in the description and said the CD was included and when I received the book the CD was missing so I contacted the seller and was issued a partial refund because I still wanted to keep the book. so the seller was very good but I am a little dissapointed with Amazon and I'm sure the seller is too.
4,A very good Filipino language book,"I think this book is probably the best Filipino language book I've come across. I'm a native Filipino speaker and bought this for somebody else, who I'm helping to learn the language. I've seen so many other Filipino books, but they were almost always not so comprehensive and not well-structured. This book, however, is easy to follow and understand. There are tiny mistakes though (usually, typographical errors)... that could easily be rectified by somebody acting as a tutor. The author(s) also cleverly incorporated the older style of writing in Filipino -- with the accented words, which is very useful for a first-time learner to get a grip on the pronunciation, without constantly being supervised. DON'T LOOK FOR OTHER BOOKS, BUY THIS ONE!"
5,Learn Filipino Book One,"If you are serious about learning the language then this is theright book. I have read various college texts and have come tothe conclusion that the majority are rather dry and plain boring.This is definitely not the case with this book. Through the useof illustrations, cartoons and other informational tidbits thisbook rises above the rest. The trouble with college texts theyrequire a native Filipino (Tagalog) speaker to be in the classroom.With the included compact disc you will gain the ability toconverse with Filipino friends and family, because you will learnproper pronunciation and sentence structure as you read along inthe book in the comfort of your home. With all good things, itrequires time and effort to gain proficiency. This book gives youthe tools to succeed, I recommended this book to friends andfamily, so have no problem recommending it to others. I am gladI purchased this book and so are my friends."
2,CD Lessons Don't Match the Book,"The book is good and gives you the information you need to learn Filpino, but the CD is very hard to follow. The CD lessons don't match the book, and you will find yourself jumping from one page to the next trying to figure out where the speakers are at in the lesson. The speakers don't tell you when they are moving onto the next subject and just ramble on. You will get lost quickly with this CD. The CD has you repeat words and sentences, but does not teach you to make for theses sentences. A good book with a very bad CD."
5,Learn Filipino one,"I've also tried several other books, cd's and cd-rom's to learn tagalog. They're ok for phrases and some vocabulary, but with studying Learn Filipino I'm finally understanding grammar, making sentences, and basic conversation skills. Learning the complex verbs in Tagalog seems overwhelming at first, but I've found this book's approach to be very helpful.The cd and website add even more to the book's effectiveness. This is how language books should be done. Maraming salamat to the author and staff who put this together. I'm looking forward to book 2!"
3,Check the CDs!,"I have visited the Philippines many times and love it dearly; plan to retire there. Received Learn Filipino book and CDs and, like others, I found the CDs cracked. Received replacement book and good CDs next day (thank you Amazon). This is not Amazon's fault, this is poor packaging by the publisher or distributor.I think the book is good but, like others, I am a little disappointed with the CDs. I wish there was much more work on correct pronunciation which is key to communicating effectively. For me, this is the most difficult part of learning Tagalog because the stresses and accents of most of the words are so different from English. Say it wrong and it has a completely different meaning - or none at all. I also think the guitar piece that precedes every single aralin should be limited to once per CD."
4,"Learn Filipino, Book One","This book is quite easy to read and understand. Having the CD to work with helps to pronounce the words correctly and understand the symantics of the language. If you want to repeat some of the sayings on the CD, it is best to have the book handy so that you can read along at the same time (see the spelling of the words). Victor Romero was very helpful and responsive to questions I have had regarding the language."
5,Classic!,"Exactly as advertised, this shaving cream has a classic barbershop scent. Lathers up extremely well and doesn't dry out my face. Highly recommended."
3,A quality product,"A good shaving cream you should probably try. Very few creams lather as well as Musgo, and the shaving comfort is also quite good. The scent is a problem for me and why I can't use it but scent is mostly subjective. Lots of people love the Musgo scent. This and Speick are two of the best quality values available in a shaving cream."
4,Decent Product,"I am trying this product now. I can say it has a good amount of lather and the aroma is very pleasant. The lather is not as rich as either Taylor of Old Bond Street, Proraso, or Geo. Trumper. The product comes out of the tube a bit too freely for my taste, but I figured that if you squeeze the tube in the middle, it works better. You won't be disappointed."
3,It gives me a rash,"The soap smells great, lathers thicker than anything I have ever used but it causes me to breakout in a rash. I did a little research and apparently I have a lanolin allergy. If your not allergic to lanolin you should love this soap."
3,There Are Better Products for This Price,"I thought I'd give this a try after having used Proraso for a while as my main shaving cream. I'd heard that Musgo Real was a good, inexpensive cream. On the positive side, it does lather easily with a brush. But in my experience I noticed I got cuts a little more frequently when using this cream than with Proraso, Omega, or Crabtree & Evelyn (my favorite so far, but more expensive). Also, I was not a fan of the scent. It wasn't bad, but I didn't like it either. It had a real cologne element to it that was quite strong and would linger for a while after shaving. It's not bad shaving cream, but I definitely prefer Proraso for the price."
3,Shaves great but doesn't smell great,"I heard a lot about this smell, one of the reasons I wanted to try this shaving cream. It lathers up really well and when it lathers one the face it almost warms up a little bit. It also provides a nice cushion. I am knocking off two stars since I think the smell is not great, it smells like soap and a little medicinal. This is still better than Gillette and considering this is a relatively expensive cream (compared to Gillette, Barbasol, etc) you get what you pay for. I just ordered Speick and it's coming tomorrow. I would say it's worth a shot if your are looking at something old school, just don't expect a super modern scent."
3,AN OK Shaving Cream with oldschool scent,This cream is just OK - the lather is not as thick and lubricated compared to others like Proraso. The smell is quite nice and lingers on your face forever it seems. It is that old school barber smell which I love. I will use this as back up or mix it with shaving soap if needed.
3,Not bad but thin lather & no strong scent,I expected more scent & the lather wasn't very impressive. OK but not for me. Some love it - no problem but I expect lather.
3,Just OK,"A nice design, but the quality is below standards. Lots of loose threads, and the fabric just isn't the same quality as other jerseys I've bought."
3,Depressing but Very Thought Provoking,"Not a very enjoyable film but watching it can add to one's understanding of humanity...Very real characters with no answers but attempting to find them with great courage...""We don't love people because they are perfect because if we did, we'd have no one to love""""A person who falls in love with themselves will have no competition"
2,Do we really care for these people?,"Are those people who give this little film more than a 2 merely being PC because of those involved in making the film? I wonder. In any event, I cared little for this film because I cared little (or nothing at all) for anyone or anything in the film, except maybe the tree. As noted elsewhere, there were many starts that went nowhere as did the film itself. Perhaps this made it such a dysfunctional experience, portrayed at its best? It's a dysfunctional film about dysfunctional people living in dysfunctional situation in their own private dysfunctional world. I'm glad I rented it. I wouldn't buy it even though it's chock full of excellent actors. I also wonder how successful this film would have been with equally talented but unknowns filling the roles."
2,Family feud....boring,"I love Nicole Kidman but I waded thru this boring movie just to see her. Jennifer Leigh's whining voice grates on my nerves. I couldn't understand for a long time why Nicole was calling her ""daughter"" Claude! Guess I'm getting old and have a hard time sorting out the long hair and dress of the sexes.I have seen family conflict/dysfunctional movies but this is not one of the good ones. Debra Winger, Donald Sutherland and some others have made much more interesting movies on the dysfunctional family subject.I did enjoy the man-child bride groom of Jennifer's. How many of these have I seen running around in real life.Rent this movie...before you buy it. Maybe I'm wrong in not liking it."
2,Disturbing and pointless,"Wow- every actor in this film is superb- but the script and the directing left me feeling hopeless, confused and annoyed. So many disturbing scenes that lead nowhere. I wish I hadn't wasted two hours of my life on this movie."
2,"A Poisonous ""Annie Hall""","It's a well-acted and produced movie, but is rather depressing -- unless watching horribly-painful family dysfunctions and individual neuroses play out is to your liking. Nicole Kidman's narcissistic (sic) character is like ""Annie Hall"" taken to poisonous extremes. There are a few humorous moments in the story, but overall it's like watching a human train wreck. If you're lucky enough not to deal with ""successful"" but neurotic, destructive people (lots of 'em in NYC for instance) and family pain in real-life, then this film may be of voyeuristic interest. But otherwise I can't recommend it."
1,One of the movies that made me distrust all independent films,"Just pure torture to watch! I had to shut it off because I refused to waste any more time on it. The previews made this movie look so good, and I think that is what made actually watching it sting so bad. You expect something funny and poignant, deep but not heavy-handed and you end up with a bunch of mush that makes no sense and makes you feel terrible while watching.I don't mind movies that make me uncomfortable at times, but please have some sort of point for the discomfort!Total waste of actors' talents.I approach all ""independent"" movies with deep trepidation now because of duds like this."
2,pointless,"What was the point? I don't get it. Margot is a horrid manipulative person and I am sorry i let her into my head space for any length of time. I guess most of the people in the moview are too, so that must be the point."
1,What was the point????,Terrible movie. I actually sat through the entire painstaking movie only to find that there was no point to it. Three great actors and nothing to show for it. Sad!
2,No one really talks like this...,"Wow, this movie was a big disappointment. I realize that movies don't always have true-to-life dialogue (""Juno,"" anyone?), but this went way off the rails as far as the script. It felt very ""stage-y"" and overwritten.The reason I'm giving it two stars instead of one is that although I didn't like the film, I DID watch all the way to the end, just to see what happened. So in that odd way, it DID hold my interest. But overall it was not a worthwhile use of my time."
1,This is defnitely not another wedding comedy,"Each to their own. For me, it was like being locked in a small room with a group of people I either loathed, or merely disliked. There wasn't one person in the film I even wanted to know. Plus, the plot meanders, and introduces various red herrings that are never fully developed or explained, like the tree and the strange next door neighbors who appear to have escaped from Deliverance. Not to mention, they never seemed to know what to do with Ciaran Hinds."
1,A very horrible film,"Well i must say Nicole kidman did not do such a good job on this one, acting was ok, the writing was suckish jack black was the only person who really made me laugh most of the time. But for some reason i watched this out of luck cause a friend gave this to me & said it was funny ehhh! Wrong horrible would never see this again in my life.I do like her other movies tho but not this one.The Others"
3,"INTERESTING, BUT FLAWED!","The first half of 'Margot At The Wedding is very promising, but it's one of the longest 90 minutes I have spent watching a film. Even though the actors do a fine job, the characters never evolve. We get to know who we're dealing with right away and that is it! I grew to care less about the characters as the film progressed. This is never a good thing and it really hurts this film. It's OK, but it loses steam half way through. Watch it on cable."
2,Congratulations are in order.,"I gave this movie two stars instead of one for just one reason. It did deal with personality disorders which seems to be at epidemic proportions in our culture right now. However, the character of Margot has Narcissistic Personality Disorder not borderline as is discussed in the movie. I give it congratulations for unintentionally grossing me out more times than any other film I've seen recently.As far as the story of the movie, I would say that you can't make a silk purse out of a sow's ear. The actors are very good, no question about it. Each one gives very fine performances. The problem lies in the script itself. It should have never went into production.This movie is definitely a rental if that."
2,"Star Power is about all that's going for ""Margot at the Wedding""","When I found out about Margot at the wedding, I was a little hesitant, but thought that Nicole Kidman and Jack Black might be able to pull it off. Well, I was wrong! Sneaking to DVD past theatres Margot at the Wedding is a negative on Nicole's and Jack's resume with this poor scripted movie. The mood is very dreary, deppresing, and...Bad. You're introduced with Nicole Kidman and her son on a boat to visit her sister, who she can't get along with, to someone's wedding. Her son is chubby, long haired, and ghastly, yet we are supposed to believe it's Nicole's son. Everybody is very disturbed with an obviously messed up family. Anyhow, I am deeply dissapoited, and saw no point to continue watching with Jack Black cursing here and there and throwing things, to Nicole climbing trees, and... climbing trees. So if you haven't yet been plagued by this film, then stay far away from Margot at the wedding."
2,Couldn't finish the movie,"I tried - I really did - the house and Southampton setting lured me in. I quit 20 minutes in - there is just nothing to recommend this film. And no, I don't need happy ending movies either. It was the script I guess - maybe the acting as well. And some scenes you wondered why they were there at all - skip this one."
1,NOT COMPLETE,Always read the reviews. As stated in another review this mount requires another purchase to mount to the ceiling. So the extra cash I paid for 2 day shipping was a waste. Now I have to locate the other peice.
5,A True Classic,"Sit back and enjoy the ride. From start to finish, this is a fascinating and at times horrfying book.The Beast In Man was first published in 1890 and is remarkable for its depiction of a world of harsh brutality and the startling frankness of its descriptions of sexual passion.If ever a book could be described as being ahead of its time, then this is it. Hard-hitting, fast paced, tragic, brutal, erotic and tear jerking, this book has it all.The plot is exceptional with characters that leap off the page and allow you, the reader, to fully experience their traumatic lives in 19th century France.All-in-all a fantastic book, written by a true genius who has undoubtedly influenced many of today's most successful scribes."
3,Good concrete detail but questionable thematic statement.,"Really evokes the local color of the Arabian peninsula and for me flashbacks to the year I spent there in the 1980s. Slow in places so you might want to skim a bit. The main question I have about this book is the ideology that seems to underly it. Americans are depicted as an inhuman, invading force devoid of all humanity. Modern science and technology seem to be condemned with the same brush, including modern medicine. You can imagine Taliban fighters in Pakistan and Afghanistan being encouraged by this book in something as crazy as killing health workers who are vaccinating kids against polio, which has actually been happening lately. Collaborators with the Americans are depicted as pure evil. Reminds me of The Kite Runner, a good book which finally lapses into propanda, but this one for the other side."
4,how arabs don't relate to each other,"There are no fewer than 50 instances in this book in which one Arab has no idea what another Arab is saying, and it has nothing to do with language or dialect. In these instances they just plainly do not understand what the other guy is talking about.This reads very well in English thanks to Peter Theroux, whose book ""Sandstorms"" is also an excellent insight into that region and its people."
4,Penny for Candy,"I ordered this children's book because it is one from my childhood that went missing at one point and I had some of the words still in my head. The book wasn't in the greatest of shape, had to repair it, tape the book text to the cover, but I don't care because I am so happy to have found a book I have been looking for for 30 years!"
3,"Works, but transmitters could be better","I had to be very careful about placing the receiver (chime unit), because the transmitters don't have anywhere near the range advertised when the signal has to pass through walls, which is exactly how doorbells need to work. My second bell is less than 50' away, and it's just barely in range. There's also a delay of two to five seconds from the time the button is pushed to when the receiver begins the chime. If I'd known this before buying it, I would have paid more to get a unit with better transmitters, or gotten two separate single bell units."
3,Not A Help For Teachers,"I purchased this with the thought that it would add another dimension to my lesson plans introducing classical music and orchestration to young children in primary grades. It did not meet my objective. The narration is a bit high-brow and dull for kids. I hoped that the CD would have tracks to go with each section of the book but that was not the case. I have been able to pull some tidbits of information from the book to include in lesson plans but overall it hasn't been useful. I would highly recommend ""The Story of the Orchestra"" by Robert Levine.I do give the book 3 stars for those who may have a young music student (maybe between 8-10 yrs. old) who is self motivated and might enjoy this book as an individual endeavor."
2,Terrible mixing! Hard to listen to.,"I LOVE the content in this book and CD. Unfortunately, this version with Ben Kingsley is almost impossible to listen to. His voice is very soft and low--difficult to understand unless you have the sound turned up very loud. Then the music comes in and blasts your eardrums out. When I listen to this with my kids I have to be near a volume control for constant adjusting. Very disappointing."
4,Better for older children(5+),"Bought this for our daughter who just turned 4 and who loves classical music. We thought she would enjoy this. I have to say that the only positive was the pictures in the book where we can show her the various orchestra instruments. The audio is really targeted to older children yet still has good pieces. The text in the book is also geared towards older children(not even appropriate for us to read it word for word to her). It will be great for our daughter when she's a little bit older. So if you're hoping that this will work out for your pre 5-6-7 year old child, keep these elements in mind since we clearly were hoping for the best."
5,Good quality battery,"Purchased this battery for my phone. Easy to install, is working great. Holds a charge well. Good purchase item. Highly recommend."
3,Very interesting,"As a relative newcomer to Old Testament textual criticism, I found this book most helpful. It taught me a lot, and provided me with a lot of information that I would otherwise not know where to find. It is, though, marred by a few slips. They may sound trivial, but textual criticism is largely concerned with what seem to be trivial slips! For example, Hendel fails to realise that the Italian scholar U Cassuto and the Israeli M D Cassuto are one and the same person. He does not note that he is referring to the second edition of Spurrell's book, though given that he dismisses it as of little value, he may not have noticed the fact that it is a second edition. But I do not want to suggest that these minor blots detract too much from the book."
5,Wonderful Read!,This book is entertaining and will have you turning the pages until the end! Jova and Davan are great characters with genuine depth that you can relate to. Get this book! You don't want to miss this romance!
2,I am glad,"that I no longer can dance after seeing what the world of dance seemingly have turned out to be.Anorexia has always been a problem, but this beautiful girl . . . I also didn't realize that ""torture"" has become an accepted form of exercise. When one dancer, never mind how light, will stand on the out-turned thighs of another dancer, lying on the floor, in order to enhance turnout????Watch the blond (older) teacher and compare the poise and natural ability, including natural turnout, to that of the main character who unfortunately seems to have tried to force her turnout beyond her physical ability and has become somewhat knock-kneed which unfortunately hurts her otherwise beautiful lines. Another donation to a survival center as this is not a movie I enjoyed nor would I want to watch it again"
5,the first of great dance movies,This movie always reminded me of training in new york for my career on stage. The focus was more on the music than on the dancing
1,skin care,"I have used Formula 405 products for 43 years and have had great results with my skin. However I was sent this one instead of the cream I ordered -Formula 405 night cream (heavier)- and to tell the truth, it is still in my cabinet as I can't stand the smell of it and that is all night. I am dissatisfied with the AHA Facial Night Cream."
3,EBD textbook review,"This was my textbook for a class on EBD. The chapters are kinda long and took me a long time to read, but the information is great. I wouldn't even say it's hard to read, it's just a lot to digest. There is a lot of info on the theoretical models (a chapter on each) and educational applications for each. There is also a chapter each on internalizing and externalizing disorder which covers depression, anxiety, ADHD, and conduct disorder. The chapter on adolescence talks about sex, drugs, etc, transition planning and behavior strategies. The last chapter deals with youth violence, PBS, specific academic intervention (and RTI) and inclusion. Overall I'd say this is a good book, not too hard to read, with lots of good info. But if you're looking for something to just sit down and read this wouldn't be my choice."
2,Emotional & Behavioral Disorders: Theory and Practice Review,"This book is very ""dry,"" and it's hard to get through one chapter without yawning a few times. However, you do learn a lot. I do not recommend this book if you're reading it ""just for fun!"""
2,Love this bag but.....,"I have this bag in the light camel color and I have enjoyed using it for the last 9 or 10 months. However, the welt that goes around the bottom shows wear and tear. I do not put it on the floor in restaurants or restrooms, so I can only conclude that it has received wear just from brushing up against people and things. None of my Louis Vuitton (or even Coach) bags have ever shown wear like this. I love the look and design of the bag. I just wish the quality and longevity of the bag was better. I doubt if I will ever buy another Tod's bag or shoes because the quality is not what you would expect for a bag in the $1,000 range. If you are looking to spend this much for a bag, choose another designer if you want the bag to last a few years--this one won't."
4,Kimono is Wonderful,"The Kimono is beautiful because it captures the right details. However, the Japanese barbie still needs work. Her eyes should looks more innocent like grace."
5,THE BEST BOOK OF SHAKESPEARE'S WORKS YOU CAN BUY!,"THE LIBRARY SHAKESPEARE IS EXCELLANT. IT CONTAINS ALL OF SHAKESPERARE'S PLAYS, POEMS, AND SONNETS. IT HAS A BEAUTIFUL HARDCOVER, YET IT IS STILL THE EXACT SAME WORDS THAT SHAKESPEARE WROTE. I HIGHLY RECCOMEND THIS BOOK TO EVERYONE!"
4,Pogorelich: The Master of Rubato,"Mr Pogorelich gives a well articulated and clear version of Mussorgsky's Pictures, however, the expansion on phrases doesn't make sense. All of his playing is a Masterclass of technique and talent, it would be simply much better if the music could be left as the most important part of his creation. Ivo is one of the greatest pianists of the century, he should be just ""Ivo "" and not ""Il Divo""."
1,Don't believe the hype,"look at the ""reviewer"" with the multiple glorious postings from Oakbrook, IL. If it were actually a quality machine you wouldn't need to falsify reviews, would you?"
2,Don't have but wouldn't buy,"Was looking at high-end home espresso makers (about $1,500) this fall and a word of warning to anyone considering this unit: most people who care about espresso consider two separate water boilers to be a must. You need the boilers not only for hot water but for pressure to properly force the water through and to generate steam for your lattes and cappuccinos. So the way it normally works is you have one boiler for water and pressure for your espresso and a separate, second boiler to do your steaming. This unit only has one.Something to think about if you think you're getting a real ""high-end"" machine for really cheap."
3,Don't forget the bandaids!!,I bought this machine as a house warming gift for my son and his girl friend. It is a fine proformer and impressive looking but the one we recieved has many very sharp edges in places where hand and finger contact is unavoidable. I will probably end up fixing it myself as sending it back is more trouble then it is worth. At this price the bandaids should be included.KDM
5,comfy and sturdy,"I love these socks (and don't care if that green shade is available or not). They stay up well, are wonderfully comfortable, and haven't faded with multiple runs through the laundry."
5,Great Socks! Perfect length,"These are my first sets of argyle knee socks. I bought two, (navy and black color schemes) though the whole collection looks wonderful too.Thickness and length were my first concerns, but I'm wonderfully surprised. The length hits right below the knee, (I'm sure you could stretch them slightly more) and they're warm but not too thick that it would bother how your shoes would fit. They even fit well with my heels.Again, great socks and a great buy!"
4,I love these socks!,"I love these socks. The color is rich, they reach to just below the knee (I have very long legs) and stay up nicely."
2,Premature Failure,"We used this KSM2 grinder for 3 years for spices only. Used it for about 20 grinds per year, or total of 60 times. When it stopped working the other day, I took it apart and discovered the problem. The micro switch extends about 5 inches into an area where is it secured by a very flimsy plastic part. This is, of course, the part that broke and the switch was rendered useless.I will admit that the grinder did a very good job with spices. However, 60 uses does not qualify as a well made product.For all the other reviewers who primarily use blade grinders for coffee beans and complain about dust and timing issues, I would highly recommend a burr-type coffee mill. Once you use one, you will never go back to a blade grinder."
3,ok grinder,"Grinder works fine, and is expected for the price. Like most coffee grinders out there, it is difficult to clean and it's loud!"
2,Broke after less than 5 yrs of low use,"Had this one for less than 5 yrs. Used it less than once per month. Motor froze and it no longer works. If you are going to use as a spice grinder, beware that the metal bowl is hard to clean and cannot be put in the dishwasher."
1,died after only 2 uses,"first 2 time i used it worked, third time i found only some sound comes as if motor is trying to function but thats it. Very disappointed. Will contact amazon and see if they would have any suggestions!"
4,Braun KSM2 - Black Automatic Coffee Grinder,Good coffee bean grinder that can also be used to grind herbs and spices as well.
1,Braun Coffee Grinder,This coffee grinder leaked coffee down inside the motor rendering it useless within two weeks of receiving it.
5,It does its job.,I have been using it for a few weeks now. So far so good. Highly recommended. It does its job making fresh coffee.
2,poor choice,"I have bought 2 of these grinders. The first one lasted a year and the second one 6 months. I should have known better after the first one died, but I guess it was the price, and also that I'm an optimist, that made me try it a second time."
4,"A good, inexpensive, no frills grinder","As a coffee addict, my Braun coffee grinder is one of my favorite small kitchen appliances. It grinds quickly and evenly, and has lasted me for years already. Although a teaspoon or so of grounds gets packed into the bottom, a quick rap on the side generally frees them. The grinder is fairly small (a little over seven inches high) so it does not take up much counter space, a big plus for most kitchens.If you like freshly ground coffee, you can't go wrong with this simple and efficient grinder. Package this with a pound of whole beans, and you've got a great gift."
4,"Not bad, but the Krups works better for us","A little over 6 months ago we read about the benefits of grinding flaxseed and eating it with cereal, and decided to try it. So we bought this grinder for the purpose, and it worked reasonably well.However, while staying at a friend's house we tried the same thing with a Krups grinder, and found that1. it ground the flaxseeds more thoroughly (we think it is because of the oval shape), and2. it was quieterWe like the Braun's space for cord storage, and the Braun seems sturdy enough, so it's not a bad unit. But we bought the Krups 203-70 and have been using it for a few weeks now, and prefer it."
4,In Search Of . . .,"I've had this grinder for about three years now and it's slowly dieing. I tend to use it about once a week and have noticed that it's starting to slow down so it must be on its way out. I just thought I'd mention it since there were some reviews saying they had theirs for 15+ years.It's a little loud, but you are grinding hard beans not jelly beans so that should be expected. So as to not wake the baby, I wrap mine with a hand towel and that's usually all that's needed.It also does a nice job of quickly making a fine ground.All and all, it has been a good grinder. I may buy the same one again, but I would like something that lasted a little longer. Still three years for fifteen bucks isn't bad. I may lean towards the Bosch since I really like the brand and have read that their home appliances are some of the best, but that's still to be determined."
4,Nice grinder,"I use it for coffee and dry herbs. It works great, but don't use it for big batches or it will overheat."
4,Perfect for the office,"Some of us in the office prefer to not drink the office swill and chip in on higher quality coffee, which typically tastes best fresh ground. I bought this for the office, and it works great. We put the beans for the whole pot in and they are ground in 30 seconds or less (depending on who does the grinding!).I also have and older Braun at home that I use from time to time to grind nuts and spices. Great little machines."
4,simple and efficient,"bought this grinder recently, and for it's price, this is a definite keeper. it's compact so it takes very little counter space and sturdily built. i love the fact that you can safely wind the cord at the base of the grinder; makes for a very clean storage.one thing i don't quite like about this grinder is that i can't detach the blade and grinding container from the base. this makes it hard to clean, especially since i use mine to grind spices as well (works like magic). as a struggling student, i can't really afford to get a separate grinder for my spices, not to mention space being an issue, so i make do. however, i guess for its price, this is a great bargain.with it's sleek construction, yhis is one snazzy addition to any kitchen."
4,coffee grinder,I received bag of coffee beans as a gift. bought the grinder to usethem. Works great and coffee tastes good.Easy to use and has plently of power.
5,Little Workhorse,"I bought one of these in 1993 and have used it twice daily ever since. The hub developed cracks long ago and I've long feared that the blades would fall off, but so far, so good.It is true that with finely ground coffee the grounds tend to get compressed below the blade, but I usually stop grinding just before that point. Also, the grounds stick to the lid, so there is invariably a mess when you remove the grounds.And it does make a horrendous racket. Still how many things can you think of that cost [$$]and have functioned flawlessly every day for seven years straight?I use it to make strong open-pot drip coffee. [A coffee shop] does not compare. And it is rare that I find coffee in a good restaurant that I prefer."
4,Powerful and simple,Compact yet works very well. A little loud but you cant beat it for the price! I only wish there were a more idiot-proof measuring system.
5,another approach,This is a excellent book for those who want a deeper more fulfilling way to work the steps. Great for the spirit and very uplifting.
5,"Joe Arroyo ""20 Exitos Originales""","Here are a collection of tracks by Joe Arroyo taken from various albums recorded for Sony during the 1990's. The style of music is mainly salsa, and all 20 tracks on this double CD are excellent in my opinion. I have always liked Arroyo's music going back to his earlier recordings for Colombian record label Discos Fuentes, and these more recent recordings are worthy of any Latin music lovers collection."
2,Not Durable,"I used this mixer 5 times and the last few times the beater fell out of the mixer. Could be that the dough was too heavy, but it was just cookie dough. I am now searching for a new mixer."
5,Works so great I bought a second one as a backup...,"12/07/06 - MY FIRST BEATER SWITCH FAILED AND IT WON'T WORK AT ALL. THE THING IS IMPOSSIBLE TO TAKE APART SO FIXING IT SEEMS DIFFICULT. I BOUGHT ANOTHER ANYWAY AS THIS IS A GREAT MIXER AND I USE THE WHIPPER FREQUENTLY FOR HOT CHOCOLATE.2004 - I do not understand the bad reviews...I read this was the quietest mixer and boy it is! I works great and the design is real handy. The drink mixer tool works great for hot choclate, mixing and grinding items for salad dressing and puree of soup. I have had none of the problems others with low reviews give. This is top notch and I find when I locate a great product at a great price I buy a backup because one day I may wear out the one I have."
1,Beware of this product,"We bought a Braun Multimix 880 to replace an old Sunbeam mixer that had soldiered on for about 30 years. Having used a Braun coffee grinder for about 25 years with no problems, we anticipated a good, reliable device. However, the thing was a piece of junk. It was underpowered, didn't mix batters particularly well and, after the second use, it broke completely. It will simply not even turn on. I made several attempts to get help replacing it and was sent to a service center 70 miles away; they told me it wasn't worth gettung the thing repaired. Trying to navigate the Braun/Procter and Gamble website to register my disatisfaction was an additional nightmare. The Braun Multimix 880 is not worth the money being charged. There must be better products out there than this."
4,Braun M880 Multimix 4-in-1 Handmixer,"This has to be the best handmixer I've ever used. It has more power and is faster than I expected. I absolutly love it.When I first saw the beaters, I was skeptic because they looked so flimsy, but not so. And when the company claimed the splash is held down, I didn't believe it but, it is the truth.I would recommend this mixer to anyone."
5,Braun mixer,This is a great mixer. After having several other brands fail we found this one and did not know if it would last or we would like it. We find ourselves reaching for it for lots of different uses. Love the chopper part of the mixer. It has been in use well over a year and still doing great.
4,best mixer ever!,"I promise I will never be without a Braun mixer! I have one and i loved it so much that i got one for my daughter a few years ago for Christmas. She told me she already had a mixer and asked where i got it (amazon). she decided that it was too much trouble to return it. Whan she fianally tried it she fell totally in love! So much so that she bought her mother in law one for Christmas the next year, who fell in love as well! This one replaced my daughter's first one which met it's tragic end. So if you think you already have a mixer, trust me, you don't unless it's one of these! i rarely use my kitchen aid,preferring the Braun. My only complaint is, if you drop them, they're toast! Did you hear that, BRAUN??!! Buy it! you'll love it!! I promise!"
4,Works great!,Makes short work of thick batters. This is the first mixer I've had with wire beaters and am very pleased.
2,Power unimpressive,"I had a wonderful mixer that got heavy use for years and it finally gave while I was doing my Christmas baking. I did my homework and decided to purchase the Braun MultiMix. I love the concept of the all in one. I was, however, sorely disappointed when I plugged it in and discovered that the mixer didn't have nearly the power or rpm's that my old mixer had. Needless to say, this mixer went right back into the box and back to the store. This is not the mixer for you if you do alot of baking. I ended up testing the power of various mixers in the store before I bought and chose a Cuisinart 5 speed that I'm tickled with:-)"
3,Not for me,"Usually like Braun products, but this one is not for me--didn't inspire any confidence in handling tough jobs.1. Too many plastic parts2. Flimsy looking beaters3. Flimsy looking cutting tool"
3,short life poor warranty service,"I really love the multimix. I use all the features and have owned 8 of them in the last 12 years. It has two major problems, though. The switch problem where it stops working on all but high speed; and the problem of ""stripping the wand/beaters where they spin out under load. I bought 4 of them on sale and when one of them broke within the first year, Braun would not honor the warranty because I had purchased it so long ago even though I had used it less than a year. I like the versatility of this product so much I just ordered another one. (call me stupid) I do use the wand every day, though."
2,Not up to Braun Standards IMO,"I ordered the Braun MultiMixer on the strength of reviews and based on my experience with their mini-chopper/stick blender which I have had for years.What a disappointment! The first one we brought home from the store did not work at all. The replacement was less than wonderfull:- the beaters wobble- the power is not impressive- it is awkward to hold- and there is no way to balance the unit on the edge of your bowl while you mix.Finally after less the 3 months of use, the unit cuts off in use due to a problem with the cord. A call to Braun reveals that I have to ship it to a Braun Service Center in a another city at my expense to have it fixed.Am I happy with this $40 purchase? NOT!Woulod I buy another one? NO WAY!"
5,Love This Machine,"This is my third multimix, and I have to say I can't live without one! I use this all the time, I make alot of soups and cutting vegetables is not my favorite thing to do. The chopper makes very quick work with very little mess, easy to clean and easy to use.And the reason this is my third one is my fault! I beat them up and then twice have tossed them off the counter by mistake."
4,Braun Multi Mixer - good choice,"Delivery was prompt. The number of accessories was surprising, considering the reasonable cost. Have not yet tried the dough hooks but the clever cutting blade feature, in its own container, does a great job choppping onions with just a few ""pulses"". Great addition to the modern kitchen.Downside is the many-sided chopping container rather than a smooth, round one for quick cleaning, but immediate rinsing after use ameliorates this design flaw."
2,not powerful enough,even though this has a strong motor it did not meet my standards of rpm. i like a mixer to have a good speed and this one just did NOT i sent it back and bought a sunbeam 2551 and it is terrific
2,Still not worth it at 75% off,"Needing to replace my much loved 10+ year old KitchenAid Ultra Power Plus 5 speed handmixer (I damaged the cord) I succombed to a 75% off sale and bought the 350 watt Braun. What a disappointment. The beaters keep getting out of alignment and make a terrible racket. When they are working properly, thick batters creep up the stems. This one is going in the charity bag.That said, I also have a Braun multiquick handblender which was indispensible grinding up baby food for all three of my children, and still seeing almost daily use."
5,Workhorse,"I do not have this new model, but rather an older version. I can honestly say this hand mixer has been a workhorse in my kitchen for over 13 years. I have a larger Kitchen-Aid stand mixer which is great for big jobs, but on small jobs and chopping, nothing beats this mixer. In addition to heavy use of the mixer attachment, I find the chopping attachment particularly useful for everything from salsa to salad dressing to cutting vegetables. Again, I don't think mine is the M880 (if it is, it is a MUCH earlier version!), but I can say that my little mixer continues to power on. It was a worth while investment 13+ years ago, and continues to work hard for me today!"
4,"Braun M880 Mixer a fine product, but with a flaw","A fine hand mixer with useful attachments. We have our own and have given several as gifts. BUT, some have a flaw that causes a failure where the only speed is full on. The problem is lead breakage of the control transistor on the printed circuit board. The leads were preformed for insertion with too sharp a bend causing metal fatigue and eventual breakage with use. Disassembly and soldering across this break restores the product to its excellent normal performance."
5,Better than expected,This mixer is powerful and easy to use. I actually got it to use in my soap making business - however discovered I liked it better in my kitchen and have already purchased a 2nd Braun M880 for mixing the soap products. The blender works great for making mayonnaise and the chopper attachment works very well (however the capacity is a bit small). I recommend this mixer. Unless you like the looks of the more expensive counter top type mixers - this one will do the job.
5,Handy & Versatile,"I was looking for an immersion blender and purchased this after reading the reviews.I've had it for about a month and have used everything but the dough hooks. It's super easy to snap together, and also easy to clean and put away. I have a tiny tiny kitchen and this lives in its box above my top shelf of cabinets, but I'm always dragging out the stepstool because this gadget is so useful (I've considered awarding it some of my precious 2 sq feet of counter space, but I really need the coffeemaker out there).I used to bake banana bread using nothing but a fork and a bowl and a bread pan (really!) and this treat that used to take me over an hour (not including bake time) is now an easy convenience food!!I've also made my own healthy dip by using the food chopper for veggies and then stirring them into nonfat yogurt, and I use the immersion blender to liquefy my banana/melted butter ingredients because I like my banana bread homogenous.This thing is fantastic! Highly recommended."
4,Great for small batches of baby food!,"I would give this mixer 5 stars, except that I need to buy my third mixer in 11 years. Its nice to have one tool that is a mixer, can make healthy fruit smoothies, AND can make small batches of homemade baby food. I used this small chopper to make baby food for all 4 of my kids, the mixer to make cakes and other things, and the blender for smoothies for the kids. If you have babies, or plan on having them, this is great to have. The bad thing, is that the motor burns out. I don't feel I abuse it, or overuse it, but my first mixer burned out in about 5 years, my second in another 5 years. This is not a long term appliance. My current multimix is a 280 watt, but my first one was smaller wattage I believe."
4,powerful,"Really like this multimix, lots of power. I was concerned buying off the net, I like to see things in person but was not disappointed."
3,great while it lasted,"Worked fine for a few years, then something broke inside and it would only work on the highest speed setting which makes mash potatos kind of interesting to make (need goggles). Should of been more durable. I may purchase another one because it was so handy, I just wish it was more durable."
2,"Great while it works, bad when it does not.",I purchased this 11/06. On 2/08 it stopped working except for high speed.When it worked it was terrific. I especially loved the chopper attachment.It is disappointing to pay for a product that lasts a little over 2 years.Not sure I could honestly recommend buying it unless you do not mind having to shell out for a new one in two years.
4,Multiple Attachments Make This A Winner,"I've used this little mixer more in the past couple of weeks than I ever used my stand mixer in ten years. It is so convenient to use, and it's small enough for easy storage.The chopper attachment is powerful and the cleanup is easy. I've used it for all sorts of veggies, and even minced fresh ginger in it. Fresh salsa was a breeze and SO much better than store bought.The stick blender works great. The motor is so powerful that you actually get a suction effect on the bottom of the bowl. The mixer is also powerful--it handled a cake mix with ease.I would have given it five stars, but I thought (from reading another review) that it came with a wall mount to hang it. This does not come with a wall mount, so storage isn't quite as convenient as I had hoped."
3,Great mixer but it doesn't last long.,"I bought this mixer on sale about two years ago. It has done a great job on mixing and kneading, and the attachments are great too. The problem is that I picked it up to mix a cake the other day, and found that it now only works on the high speed. I had just used it the previous week and it worked well. I use my hand mixer a lot, but not so frequently that it should have worn out. I think an appliance like this should last more than two years. I have always found Braun appliances high in quality, so I am very disappointed,"
3,Also broke in 2 years,At first I adored this mixer...however...it also broke in 2 years. As stated by another review....the mixer began to work only on high speed...and a few weeks later....completely broke. I do not use my mixer every day...mainly around holidays.....and feel that a mixer should last longer.
2,Does not last,"It was very handy while it lasted, but after about two years it only works at highest speed, just like another reviewer wrote. I have had higher expectations for Braun..."
5,BraunM880 Mixer,"I love this mixer. I had one that finally burned out after many years of heavy use. This is the most convenient little mixer as it has all the attachments that you need. It gets more use than my food processor, it's easier to set up, use, clean up and works just as well for most jobs. I was very happy to find this on Amazon after looking for it in department stores. Thank you Amazon!"
4,"Not on the same level as the original, but still strong","Marty again checks in with a high-quality tip book in the same format as his stellar ""Points Schmoints"". Bergen digs a little deeper into many of the topics he only touched in the original. Again, the material should hit a home run with novice to intermediate players, who will find a wealth of points to ponder.The humor is not quite as pithy here, but the content is still solid."
4,Must for Business Owners,"Ed Rogoff gives an in depth but workable plan for developing a new business. ""Bankable Business Plans"" gives you what you need to go from your initial idea to your financial source. Examples, forms and step-by-step instructions are included in this comprehensive book. This book is a must for business owners of any size business."
5,You can bank on this book,"This book is terrific because it directly addresses the issue that probably undermines more business plans than any other: unrealistic assumptions. After 20 years as a banker and financial advisor to growth companies, both large and small, I believe that professional equity investors judge entrepreneurs by their ideas, their ability, and the reasonableness of their assumptions. Aggressive business plan assumptions raise significant doubts in the minds of investors, who don't just want 25% IRRs but want 25% IRRs that are achievable. Rogoff wisely advises entrepreneurs to ground their plans in reality, using solid industry data and benchmarking techniques. He teaches you to think like an investor or banker before writing your plan. Very solid advice. A must-read before going to market with your plan."
5,A really good practical guide,"I found this book easy to undersatnd and very user friendly.It serves as a really good practical guide that cuts thorugh complications and irrelevant material usually associate with business plans.It has special relevance for small business owners who may not be accustomed to dealing with banks and major ivestmentors. It allows you to cut to the chase and put your best thinking, assumptions and business strategy right out front where it beloongs.A great tool and easy to use - I found it invaluable"
3,Disappointed,"I was all excited when I purchased this as a gift for my daughters. When I received the item I wrapped it up and gave it to my girls. When they opened it they were so excited. Once I plugged it in we realized that the FM radio didn't work. The radio doesn't pick up any stations unless its on the floor. Plus, when I bought it the description said it comes with 5 Ipod adapters but it NEVER did. My daughters cannot connect the Ipod without the adapters. We have looked every where for an adapter and still have not been able to locate one for this radio/alarm clock. :-( The only thing good about this item is that the alarm clock works. Overall, its very pretty in design but not much else is good about it unless you have the adapters. I would not recommend this item to anyone."
2,Misleading Description,"Although this is cute, it gives the impression that it works with MP3 players - including the matching Barbie Petal MP3 player - but it does not. There is even a picture of the Barbie MP3 player on the box. You cannot dock the MP3 player, only plug it in and play it. We bought it specifically for my 7-year to go with her new very own MP3 player, and it did not work as advertised. They are very vague about it even in the instructions. It is perfect if you have an Ipod, but not an MP3 player."
2,Does not play video output,This unit would have been perfect for my daughter's room to play videos off the ipod and display on her tv. Problem is it would not pass the video from either my 5th generation Ipod Classic nor my Ipod Nano 3G through the unit's video output. Maybe I have a lemon as this product does advertise that it has this ability and it even specifies 5G Ipod compatible with the video output.
5,El eslabón perdido de la historia de la humanidad,"Cuando uno estudia historia siempre se hace enfasis a los aspectos humanos de nuestro devenir. Pero uno escasamente conoce la CAUSA de cada evento, limitándose, en cada caso, a los aspectos económicos, políticos o ""socio-culturales"".Por eso, un libro como este, te hace comprender la posición de la humanidad dentro del esquema Divino en el que realmente está y entonces sólo te queda decir ""Gracias Padre"" por haberlo encontrado en una edición EXCELENTE en tu propio idioma y al alcance de todo el mundo."
4,Pretty good mouse & excellent service.,"This mouse arrived completely dead. I've never had to return anything through Amazon, but did not look forward to the process. However, to my surprise the online for took less than 5 minutes and they had shipped the replacement before I had mailed the dud. Service couldn't be better in my opinion. The mouse itself, other than it initially being a dud, is acceptable. The only complaint I have with it is that the radio frequency range is very short (on the order of inches). The range is so short that I have to use an extension chord to reach around my laptop, so that the little transmitter will be close enough to the mouse. Otherwise, it is a nice little portable mouse."
4,First wireless mouse owned gave it 4 stars,"In regards to several posts on this product, I have not had a problem yet; had this device for over a month now. I'm using a MacBook Pro. Worth the price (IMO)."
3,EXTREMELY SMALL,"WOW, this is a small mouse, i knew it was going to be a mini mouse but WOW doesen't get much mini then this. not so comfortable"
4,"Considering it's age, one of the best!","Yes, in this day of DSL and cable-modems, occasionally you need a real good-old fax-modem. This is the one to get! As an external you don't need to worry about internal card compatibility, and this thing is a brick! Unless you run it over with a tank it will simply keep working! We use several in a fax role and are very pleased with how they work.So why not 5*? Simple, unless you know you want what this provides (solid stability, for a cost in performance and $$) you want to look at something else. This isn't the modem you buy for your old PC to connect to AOL, it's the modem you buy when you want pure stability!"
3,Interesting how facts are left out...,"I like these guys, but what the reviews and note fail to mention is that they are gay. They are a couple and the fact is that Jason was actually kicked out the band Truth because he was gay. So, these two met and made music together. I think it is amazing that two christian guys have the faith to make christian music. What i find not so amazing is that amazon.com left out that they were gay in the intro. These guys are making a bold move into new territory and they can be role models to other christian youth. I am a gay christian, thirty-one years old, and these guys are an inspiration. And their music ain't half bad either. Buy it because we need to support those that hold their faith strong and go out on a limb to be role models for others."
5,Truly insiprational music,"This has been one of the most enjoyable CDs that I have purchased in long time. The tight harmonies of Jason and DeMarco are absolutely beautiful on their duets and their range as soloists are incredible. Having grown up in the church, this collection of songs brings back many wonderful memories. Each time that I listen to the CD it is a worshipful experience. I've especially enjoyed the cut, ""You've Always Been There for Me"" as it affirms my believe that no matter where we are in our journey that God has always and will always be there for us."
5,Inspiring music,"Alaskan Spring is my favorite song on this CD. It's enjoyable and refreshing music. The entire CD changed my thoughts about jazz - this is great listening music with a variety of tunes. I'm waiting for their next CD to come out, if it's anything like 'Reach' it will be well worth it!"
1,Piece of crap,"Do not buy this camera! I implore you, by everything held holy in this world, do not!I used to have a very nice Canon A70, but I had to give it up, due to monetary concerns. It was replaced by this very low priced camera. The pictures are the lowest quality I have ever had the displeasure to view. Even if you can get one that isn't blurred, at the highest quality settings and resolution, the pictures come out grainy and still slightly out of focus. If you use the flash the colours will be washed out and the brights glow like the sun. Save your money, this camera is an unbelievable waste of it. I would give it no stars, if that were even an option. It should be."
1,Not a deal at all.,"I was excited to see this ""6 megapixel"" camera at such a great price, but it is not really 6 megapixels at all. Although it seems easy to use, the pictures take an unreasonable time to load to the screen. The picture quality is poor, and every picture is blurred. I also found out that the price is not great at all, for a 3.2 megapixel camera. Buy something else."
1,No Memories,"When I purchased this digital camera, I wanted a camera which would provide me with digital photographs which I could preserve as memories of certain events, and this was what was basically advertised. Since I've purchased the camera, I have taken a number of photographs upon each of three special events, and each time, after taking many photographs, and wanting to take more, I would turn on the camera only to find a message of disc failure, and all of my photographs were gone, with only a memory of what I had tried to photograph remaining. My purpose in purchasing this camera was to have a means of taking and preserving photographic memories. This camera is not providing me with the advertised or desired results, and as such, in my opinion is defective. I would strongly urge anyone to reconsider their thoughts prior to purchasing this particular digital camera."
1,Not Even Worth $100 !,"Purchased this camera at Safeway for a hundred-bucks. Great interface, nice form-factor, lots of features. Too bad it consistently takes blurred and grainy photos ! Returned this camera and got a refund."
1,HORRIBLE-do NOT buy,"As you can problably see- this camera is not worth buying!I bought it because I wanted a nice tiny camera (I have the wonderful digital rebel) in addition to my real camera, but it takes HORRIBLE pictures, and it is NOT 6mp as stated. After using it for 1 month, I had to return it- it was just awful! I went for a Canon SD10 instead- I love Canon!There are too many cons on this camera to list. My advice-DO NOT BUY!"
5,Great Sound,"I can't believe I didn't buy this years ago! My ipod sounds fantastic. No static, No feedback or buzzing. It's wonderful."
4,Liked for it to last longer but it was Great,"Its great. Works well in my car, however for some odd reason i plugged this into my Phone one day and i one of teh channels go out. Turns out its damaged right at the connector piece where it looks extra protected. I'm buying another one in case this was a fluke that happened but over all, its a good product. Just remember,Keep your mp3 player, phone or ipod on Medium volume when using this and turn up the music from your car. Then put up the volume on the device as another way to adjust the bass but never have it all the way up or more than 3/4 way maximum on the device otherwise bass lines distort. I've been using these things for years in general. :)"
2,XM Auto Cassette Adapter,I ordered this and when it arrived I was surprised to find that I did not actually receive the model described or shown. I instead got a Philips model that works just fine which is the only reason I am giving it 2 stars instead of 1. If you are buying this don't expect to get the product promised because this seller is apparently blind.
2,not very nice sound,The sound is very fuzzy but it is probably better than any of the other ones. I ended up buying a new stereo and getting it installed and that sounded very well. I payed a total of $185 for all of that new system.
4,Works great / as expected,"Received this in no time at all after ordering. Have been using for about one month consistently and have encountered no issues, which from my perspective, has it already paid for itself. Sound seems to be much better than other similar units that I've had as well. Recommended."
1,Item not as described.,"I, like many others, received the Philips model, not the Belkin. Sellers should sell what they're advertising! To do so otherwise is unethical."
1,Not for Subaru,"This product will not work in my 1999 Subaru Legacy. The company was very cooperative, they sent me a second unit within 2 days which unfortunately also did not work. Yes, cassettes do play in the player, this unit is just incompatible. I was refunded the purchase price almost immediately."
3,Works but not great.,"The connection to my phone doesn't stay in place often, causing the sound to suddenly go out or (maybe worse) causing annoying static. The sound volume is lower than I would expect, and even when I max the volume on the transmitting device, I have to raise the volume high on my car speakers. While this may not sound that awful, it means that sometimes the volume is blasting when you switch from tape to radio or CD. Also, the loud volume further decreases sound quality and brings in more noise to the background. Overall, it works okay, but there are probably better options."
3,Does the job,"As many people note, the sound quality isn't excellent with this product, but I would think that's a given. But if you need a quick way to play your iPod through your car cassette deck, this certainly fits the bill."
1,Noisy and unacceptable,I got this with my XM radio.The cheap plastic parts made too much noise when they turned. It was annoying.I bought a different brand and that is much better. This one is WAY TOO CHEAPLY MADE. Spend the extra couple of bucks on a model that doesn't make noise.
1,it was a Phillips not a belkin...,"this was not even a belkin it was a phillips, it works, but i don't particularly like being lied to."
1,Keep getting ejected,"The sound quality was good, and it worked for a couple of weeks or months, then it started to get ejected once in a while. Then, It is getting ejected more and more frequently to the point that I cannot use it anymore. I see other reviewers have the same issue, so it may be due to its inherent design problem."
4,Works well,"I bought this since my car does not have the A/V input, and I wanted to stream slacker radio from my Droid incredible through my cars speakers. I was worried about static, fuzz, or issues with the tape ""flipping"" sides, and haven't experienced any of those issues. The sound is easily as clear as the radio. When there isn't music on, if I try I can hear a VERY faint clicking, but the music drowns it out...and I just turn up the volume through the phone so that I use the phone to raise the output and not the car volume (since turning up the car stereo volume would increase the faint clicking). The construction isn't exactly sturdy or high grade, but it doesn't need to be and this was very inexpensive. I'd recommend it."
1,You get what you pay for :(,I bought this to replace a 10 year old cassette adapter whose wire finally broke. I never imagined there could be any problems but this item causes my tape player to reverse directions back and forth about once a minute creating a 5 second break in playback. Since my old adapter worked flawlessly I know the problem is not with my cassette deck. The cord is also not configurable like my old adapter for different types of cassette players. Avoid this product and spend a little more money on something of high quality.
4,"Best Customer Service, Could improve on quality of item",I received one of these with faulty wiring and I sent in an e-mail with an inquisition and the seller replied within 40 minutes and sent me another one. I have had almost no problems with the new one. Only problem is that it starts to make a weird rackety sound when it's being started up.
2,eh. seems like a knockoff,"The tape would play for a minute., then keep flipping back and forth and then eject itself. I went to walmart to purchase a ten dollar philips one and it works flawlessly"
4,Cassette adapter works !,I bought this unit for my son so he could use the music on his I-phone in his car. So far the unit seems to work flawlessly !
4,Left a buzzing noise.,"Every time i play a song, you can hear a small fuzzy noise in the background.So far so good though."
3,"Poor quality sound, flimsy",Should have gone with the more expensive Phillips... :(Doesn't feel like it will last long and sound quality is mediocre compared to the adapter I'm replacing (loose wire)
3,Not bad,Nit bad I play my music in my car with this its pretty good just nt as clear as I expectes bt gets the job done
2,Makes iPod Pause,"This worked fine with my iPad, but with my iPod, the audiobook I was listening to paused every few seconds. This was very annoying and I gave up using it."
2,Worked for a NYC minute!,"I ordered this to use in my car a few months ago, at first it worked fine but then for some reason the sound would just come out from my driver side speakers. tossed it!"
2,Adapter stuck in car after a day,"I got a '99 Camry. It has a tape player. I used this adapter for my first trip, which was about two hour long. It was working for the two hours. But after a stop at a fast food joint, the adapter stopped playing. The eject button wouldn't eject the tape out. It is completely stuck.I tried pulling it out. It's either melted in there or hooked up in some mechanics. The radio doesn't function. The stereo makes annoying clicking noises. I would probably have to replace the whole stereo because of this $4 adapter. Having a tape stereo is pretty cool and I definitely didn't anticipate having to change the stereo so soon!I am going to give it a 2nd star for the benefit of the doubt, that it might had to do with my car model. Turns out my car manual warned not to put ""low-quality tape"" into the player. Well, now I know..."
3,It works,"It works, but noisy, they all are. It really doesn't take much volume to drown out the sound of the unit."
3,It works,"This is no better or worse than any other adapter I've had. After a year or so of constant use, the roller started to squeek, so I pitched it and bought another."
5,I wish I had found this before I went with the FM Transmitter,"This came VERY quickly, was only about 4 days. I was of course very excited because I had wasted $10 on a FM Transmitter that was just awful. I had lost hope and was almost about to purchase a $100 car stereo upgrade - and then I found it. I didn't even know these things existed, but it saved me $195 so thank God I found it in time. It works perfectly. Sound quality is as good as having the radio on. I can keep it pretty loud and not hear any static. No complaints whatsoever."
4,works perfectly,"I brought a car with Tape and no AUX, so I wanted to buy a cassette to 3.5 mm adapter. Researched online and saw all cheap adapters , until I saw this from Bellkin. And for the price it was better than the cheap ones. So purchased it . And product arrived on time and was in a bulk package.Till now working just fine. Only issue i felt is volume is lowered than that of FM . But it Ok and at 50% the sound is great.Now using for about 2 weeks,I recommend this to anyone..."
3,XM Auto Cassette Adapter,"I don't have any problems with the cassette ejecting itself but I haven't quite figured out how to make the volume remain consistant. One day I'll have my iPod plugged in and the max out volume will blow my ears off and the next it's as quiet as a whisper. I've played around with both the volume on my car sterio and my iPod itself and neither seem to do much good. Overall the product is worth the price you pay, you just have to be willing to get over the volume control."
3,Ya get what ya pay for,"It works, but there is some background noise. I have BOSE speakers in my car and use this with Pandora. I would recommend it if you don't want to invest too much money."
5,Thanks for a quick replacement.,Bought 2. One was replaced with a good one. Both are good now. Thanks.Product's quality is excellent considering the price I have to pay.
2,Poor quality.,"There were a couple things wrong with this product. First, the 3.5 mm jack didn't fit into my device. It constantly popped out and wouldn't stay in. Also the sound quality wasn't quite as good as another cassette that I had. However the sound quality wasn't terrible. These issues could be specific to me and you can't expect much more from such a cheap product."
5,Works great so far.,"Used it a couple times and its been working great for me, no complaints at all. Worth the money if youre looking for one of these."
4,quick shipping and,"the piece around the aux is made to move so if you jerk it out by accident you wont ruin it like the ones from radio shack and its perfect size to fit in a fat ass note 2 otter box case!!! and cheaper!!! only reason this is a 4 star is because side A is kinda screechy on and off don't know if its my player or not cause its old but hasn't ever made that sound, but side B is perfect."
4,Belkin XM Auto Cassette Adapter for Apple iPod / Apple iPhone,"works well as expected, my son says he hears a little skipping, but i don'tmore practical than installing aux plug and sounds fine!"
1,Negative,"This product if for sure not original, using the XM trademark, I'm super discouraged. Well, what goes around comes around"
3,Ok Cassette Adapter,I have 2003 Mercedes E320 with premium audio with multi discs. The sound quality for this cassette is good as long as you don't turn up the volume on your media player all the way since if you do then you will hear some noises. So my suggestion is turn up the volume around 75%-80% on your media player and if you like to play it loud then turn up your car audio instead.
4,"Decent, but a little tinny","I can't get past the feeling that the sound from this is ""tinnier"" than what the GigaWare cassette adapter I picked up at Radio Shack (for more money) puts out. I feel like the sound is just a little weaker, but perceptibly so. Enough to be annoying.They did the right thing by using a right-angle jack/connector, though. That's the reason why I had to buy a new one to begin with- the wiring in my GigaWare adapter finally started to give way near the jack connector."
4,Good for the price,"You get what you pay. It's a good adapter. If you don't mind turning your speaker volume up to hear the music then your fine. But beware if you take that Cassette adapter out your ears may bleed. I have to turn it up quiet a bit to hear it decently and if it needs to be taken off either turn off the sound or turn the radio off. But it's a great product for the price and this is my second one, as I am giving them out as gifts for such a great price and decent quality."
4,Great aux imput for old school radios.,This is great for my old school radio. The tape player itself is kinda loud or it could be my radio. Works great for my ipod!!
5,"Works great, never pops out","This is a great, simple, affordable cassette adapter. I use it with my iPod touch in my 2002 BMW. I've had problems with other cassettes in the past, where they'll pop out in the middle of a song and I'll have to hold the cassette in (one finger in the slot) to make it stay. No problems like that with this one.The wire is nice and long too, so I can pass my iPod to passengers in the back to DJ. Great buy."
3,uneven,It works but you have to postion it so that you can hear both speakers and not just one. It annoying.
1,Poor sound quality,"The device works but, the sound quality is very poor. There was significant distortion and static when music is played at any level."
5,Awwwwesome,"I have been going from radio transmitter to radio transmitter and finally decided to try the cassette adapter. It is awesome. No static, nice crisp sound and it fits perfectly into my iPhone without having to take off my case. If you have a tape player in your car and want to be able to play your iDevice, this is totally the way to go!!"
3,Better Sound Than iCarPlay (but still not working in my car),"I ended up buying both this adapter and an iCarPlay one at the same time because my car (older Honda) cassette player was ejecting the cassette (on both brands it turns out). I followed some online advice and opened up the cassette and removed extra gears that supposedly trigger an auto reverse on the tape. Well, that still didn't fix my car eject problem, but it made the quality of the adapter 100 times better when I used the adapter in a cassette player in a home stereo system, and sounds better than the iCarPlay, which had some distortion in the sound quality.So, I really like this adapter in a home stereo, but disappointed it isn't working in the car."
2,Plays no bass.,"I purchased this to replace my Monster brand cassete converter. I used it on my iPhone 4 on a 2004 Inifiniti G35x and decided to get a new one because the Monster one produced an irritating screaching/interference type noise which was difficult to get rid of. However, when I put in the Belkin Cassette Adapter, it didn't play any bass. Not that the bass was bad or not enough of it...it completely left it out. I swapped b/w the Monster and the Belkin to check a few songs and played with the settings on my car, but the Belkin just didn't produce any bass. The sound quality was horrible.Returning."
2,Makes a loud HISSING sound,"Not a good adapter - you can clearly hear a static hissing sound in the background...even if it's not turned up high. Yes, it mostly gets drown out when the music plays - but it still feels like listening to an old record. So unless you're nostalgic for the good ol' times - I would NOT recommend getting this."
3,Worked for a about 7 months then stopped working,"This adapter worked fine for about 7 months, then it stopped working. My tape player auto-reverse kept activating and eventually my tape deck would spit this adapter out. I bought another adapter and it works fine, so I know it's not an issue with my tape deck.This adapter is ok if you don't mind having to replace it after ~6 months usage."
2,belkin adapter,"Vendor delivered on time and product was in new condition. Good job!I did not receive the adapter pictured on this page. The one I received was covered with ""BELKIN"" and a blue circles pattern printed over the black adapter with NO XM logo. Belkin adapter did not perform well. To much distortion and generally the sound was not clear. This would be in comparison to the USED XM adapter, which looks like the product pictured here, and which I purchased on the same day. Later, still not completely happy with the sound quality I was getting, I went to Radio Shack and bought a Gigaware brand adapter, (much more costly), but it is performing very well. Sorry Belkin, you just don't cut it for me."
2,Barely works,"Maybe I got a defective unit, but mine does not work right at all. As soon as it is in the tape deck it starts clicking very loudly. Also the sound is very low and lacks bass. Bought as a gift for a friend without an AUX input, and now going to try something else."
1,Doesnt work,"i used this cassette adapter 3 times and then it didnt work anymore so i threw it away. when it was working it was nice, though it did over heat a lot after using it for 10 min. at first i thought maybe it was my cars player but it wasnt because my other cassette tapes worked. im pretty sure i just got a bad one out of the bunch."
2,Doesn't last for long enough,Had a Phillips one that did the job perfectly. This one continually clicks like it needs to change sides or something. Disappointed in this purchase.
3,Good quality when it works,"I have a '99 BMW and it has a stereo with cassette player on it...so instead of waisting a whole bunch on upgarding it I decided to get this to be able to hear my iPod. Now sound quality is better than expected and better than others that I've heard...but sometimes my stereo reads cassette error so it stops, I have to reinsert the cassette in order for it to work again but this happens quite a few times so that would be my only issue. Although Ill admit that it may be a stereo problem but not sure still i would recommend it."
2,Not satisfied with this item.,"Unfortunately, you get what you pay for. While this item is on the lower end price wise for a car adapter, the quality of your music is terrible when used with an Ipod. Even with turning my Ipod's volume on high, it still comes through with little to no bass with the radio being at it's maximum volume. I will go back to buying the $19.95 Sony ones."
3,1/2 worked,I bought this Belkin XM Auto Cassette Adapter after my old Sony Tape adaptor broke. It had good reviews on Amazon so I thought I'd go for it.I bought 2 knowing how fickle and easily breakable these things are. 1 out of the 2 adapters was dead on arrival. The other had worked well so far (3 days). The one that was dead kept reversing directions to the unusable side in my tape deck; the other one has not had this problem.I wish both had worked.
3,Ordered Belkin gor Phillips Instead,"Like many people on here i ordered the Belkin because it was reviewed as the better quality adapter but i recieved a phillips instead. The sound quality is really good so far but i notice after a while one side becaomes ""weak"" and a balance adjustment is required. But when i first start the sound is very clear and full on both sides. For $12 though would have much prefered the Belkin. Also after about a week it makes very loud noises from the ""wheels"" turning."
1,Won't work keeps ejecting!,"I got this today and was so excited, I thought wow I will finally be able to play my MP3 player through my van cassette player. Boy, was my bubble of excitement short lived and burst quick, ugh! Well, could not wait until I had a reason to go out and get in my van and go to CVS. I'm disabled so I rarely go out much. I would love to be able to listen to my MP3 music in my old van. Get in the van start it up, plug in the adapter into my Mp3 player, push it in the cassette player and BAM NOTHING! It stays in a hot second and ejects! Tried it over and over again and to no avail it will not work. I'm so very disappointed! Guess I will research online see anyone having the same problem and what they did to fixed it."
4,Does what I wanted it to do.,"I purchased this adapter to play my mp3 player on a long road trip in a 2005 MB that didn't have an aux input. Other reviewers had said that there was a slight hum and there is, but with road noise, you don't really notice it. We listed to an audio book and had no problem hearing it and thought the sound quality was just as good as the music we listened to. It is a great alternative to the FM transmitter that really hums and breaks up. WELL worth the money."
4,Works well,"Easy to use. Product arrived promptly, and now my cassette deck is useful. I don't even think I've ever used the cassette deck since I the day I got the car."
5,Works Great,"The item is exactly as pictured. A black XM cassette, but works perfectly for an iPhone. It fits well into the audio port. The sound is great. The shipping is also very fast."
4,liked it..,works great in my car.. mine is a 2003 Acura so dont have an aux .. this gives me great music experience for my Bose system.earlier had a radio transmitter which sucked..this is great!!
1,I am using it to rebuild my old one!!!,Well it does not work... I actually got three because they were cheap and I could not find it in the store. All three of them were garbage. The casett player would change directions every other minute. First I blamed the player so I found some old tapes and they work like a champ... 80's technology for you... and quality sucked back then... anyway back to this product... bottom line DO NOT BUY IT!!! unless you enjoy littering the high way or dragging objects from your car while going at the speed limit of course…
5,Worked great,"I've used it for some time now and have no complaints. It works well, the sound quality is fine, it has held up without problems with quite a bit of use (I commute daily 1 1/2 hours and use it most of the time."
4,Adpater is a good value,"The Belkin XM Auto Cassette Adapter has worked flawlessly for us. We use it with our Android Smartphones to listen to our mp3 selections and the quality is quite good considering how affordable this unit is. We decided not to replace the cassette player in my son's truck, since we do not listen to CD's anymore. We will buy a second unit as a back-up."
1,"Buyer beware, not worth your time.",Adapter had a muffled left channel and unusable. Confirmed that it was not my deck. Not worth the hassle to return.
1,worthless,Plugged this into several portable music devices and even with the volume set to max the music is nearly inaudible and lacking in any depth. Pointless.
1,SUCKS!!,"I have a 1999 Infinity. This tape plays clearly when it feels like it (which isn't often), from day one of me receiving this cassette. Most of the time there is static when Im listening to my music. The static level varies, not even day to day but hour to hour. Each day I get in the car wondering if the tape is going to act right. I got so tired of wondering that I just stopped use all together and am looking for a new, different, and more updated brand to buy. Only have had for a couple of weeks also."
1,wendy,This product came and it never worked. It was junk from day one. I hooked it up to my ipod in the car and all I got was a loud humming noise.
5,Great product,"This cassette adapter works wonders. With so many different brands, Belkin Xm does the job and does it well. I definitely recommend this product for anyone who is interested in listening to books or music from an ipod, phone, etc..."
1,Put the money towards a good one,"Worked for about a week, now doesn't. The tape remained in the stereo, so I see no reason for it to stop working.Upon inspection, it does look cheaply/poorly made. You get what you pay for, but still for the price I expect better. My recommendation is to just put the money toward a better product that will last.Good luck out there!"
1,wasting money,"It didn't work. When I insert it, it just popped put right away. I wasted my money for this junk :("
2,Its works but not well.,"You get what you pay for. In most cases. Well, at least in this case. It is fully functional but the overall quality of the sound is poor. Even if it was to cost less than the 9 or 10 dollars I paid, I would still not purchase this product again."
5,Works As It Is Supposed To.,Everything about this sale was positive. It runs quiet and has a good reproduction of the sound.The only thing that I cannot comment on is its longevity.
1,wasted $,"Although it does play my mp3s though the cassette deck in my car , it also creates a loud humming noise over the music when the car is running, making this product completely useless."
2,Awful sound,Awful sound. I had actually gotten two of them and both had the same awful sound. I wound up just buying a replacement for my existing adapter (Griffin Direct Deck from Target) and it worked beautifully.
4,good for price,It came quickly enough so no issues there. I use it to play songs from my mobile. It connects well with mine but there seemed to be some connection issues with my friends mobile . My player has not rejected the tape even once. It doesn't give me the greatest quality sound but it doesn't have any noise or interference either. it's good value for money.
3,belkin,"This adapter provide a good sound quality even in a old radio cassette this work really good to me, i really recommend this adapter"
3,XM Adapter,The product is a representation for your $. It gets the job done but not with the best quality. Does work fine but with a little bit of muffled sound. Shipping was extremely quick.
4,great!,this item was a great price & it worked perfectly.note: it's pretty noisy when you don't have any music playing - other than that I highly suggest this item!
1,Product doesn't work as advertised,"One star simply because the adapter doesn't work as the description says. From the decription: 'Works with iPod, MP3, CD, or any other portable player through the headphone jack'. Not compatible with iPod Touch or any other device with a headphone jack that I've tried. After I purchased the item, I received an e-mail that said the product that was being shipped was not the same as the one that was listed on the product's respective Amazon page. If you are looking for a cassette adapter, this is not the one for you unless you're planning on using it with XM radio."
2,Works but...,"I ordered this to replace an older Phillips adapter that started to go bad. While this does work, it works poorly. The audio quality just isn't there. I have to turn up the volume on my car stereo almost all the way just to get it to a reasonable level. Even then the audio is distorted because the car stereo can only amplify so much before it starts to sound like garbage. The cable on the adapter is very thin so I think that's probably what's causing the problem. The cable on my older adapter was much thicker. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this if you want any sort of audio quality."
1,Lost of money,Please be aware that this is not a genuine XM cassette adapter. The item came in the envelope in just a small plastic bag with no indication of brand/company address or whatsoever. The adapter is 100% not-working. I plugged it into the car cassette player. After 5 seconds it gets ejected. Tried 5 times. Spend couple more bucks and buy original adapter. This thing is completely useless!! My first bad experience on amazon.
1,Not Worth it,I purchased this product for cheap hoping I wouldnt have to buy and expensive one. Big mistake. This was a waste of a few of my dollars and ended up buying a more expensive one in store.
1,crap,this product is absolute crap... take my word on it and spend a little more money for something that actually works.
1,bad impression about amazon!!!!!!,"I'm really frustrated with this purchase.I was a bit suspicious about internet shopping, but now I'm really negatively impacted. I purchases this cassette adapter as a Belkin XM brand, but I found that it was a scam as they sent me a Philips one. I really don't know what to do!!!! If I thought about returning it I would pay for the shipment!!!"
1,Does Not Work,"The item did not work out of the box(well envelope in this case). Spent half an hour trying to get it to play my car. Finally gave up and considered the fact that it might have been my cars cassette player that was to blame. However I tried it in my mates car and it dint work either. Like the other reviews on this page say, customer care is very nice. But as they dont pay for shipping you would only get a bulk and half back if you returned it.This product is like a coin toss, you might be the lucky few who get a good piece or unfortunate like me and get a dud."
1,Don't buy this,"This item did not work properly when it arrived. It played mono, not stereo. Item was faulty and we proved it by running various tests.Don't buy this one."
4,pretty good,When the package right arrived it was a little rough around the edges and flimsy in my hand. But plugging it into my cassette player i was pleasantly pleased. It's a little shaky underneath but the music covers it up. Great product for the price!
5,Hands down the best deal for the money,"I would imgaine like many other Sirius subscribers, I was getting very frustrated with the my FM transmitter. Everytime I drove into a new county or city, I would have to change the station on both the radio and the receiver so I could get a clear signal. When I saw this product and realised that I had a tape player in my truck I decided to give the XM cassette adapter a try. I could not be happier with the results. The sound is crisp and clear and I never have to mess with changing the stations again. I can now enjoy my Sirius. Finally!"
5,works great,This adapter works great with my ipod and LG smart phone. I am very satisfied and for the price you cant go wrong!
3,Nice but not great!,"The product is good and works to play music from my phone. However, there is some static that can be heard in background."
4,Decent,"For this price, I think this cassette adapter really works well. The sound is clear and crisp.The only complaint I have about it is that when it is in, it makes a low but hearable winding gear sound. So unless you have your volume at a decent level, you can hear a slight humming."
1,Terrible,Shouldn't have gone cheap with this...I have a Hyundai Sonata 2002 and it does NOT work AT ALL...thanks for nothing
5,Gift for my daughter,"Nice, useful, minimal cost, when my daughter breaks this one or loses it, I won't be troubled since basically it's very replaceable."
2,Static is heard,Static is heard when playing. Tried two different devices with same result. But then what do you expect for 4 bucks.
1,didn't work for me,"I have an Iphone 4 and wanted to use this in my car. It didn't work. I contacted the seller and got a reply email asking me to call to arrange for a return label. Since the item was very inexpensive, I didn't try to make arrangements. I would have liked an email with the return details as is typical for amazon returns. Oh well."
2,worthless,"I bought this to replace a similar model I had that had gotten old and was wearing out, but this one has terrible sound. I don't know if it's just the connection of the wire or the device, but there's just constant background static. I had to go back to the old one."
4,Nice device for older vehicles,"I purchased this device for my son. He drives an older truck that does not have a radio with external inputs or Bluetooth so he can't hook up his iPod. The device performs well. The only issue he has had is with distortion, which is somewhat common with these types of devices. I told him to turn down the volume on his iPod (or whatever device is being used for input) and that should take care of the distortion. Once he did that, he has been very happy with the adapter (except that he can't play it quite as loud since his iPod is not at full volume). Great adapter for radios without any external inputs! I would recommend it with the caveat that you need to turn down the volume on the input device if you get the distortion."
1,Turd...,"Product malfunctioned literally 1 day after I could get a full refund on it. Sound quality is horrible...like fingers on a chalkboard. Popping, crackling, static. It sounds terrible. My wife has one for the iPod that works beautifully in my car, so obviously not the car tape player causing this. It was cheap, so I assume you get what you pay for. I'm going to contact seller today to see if we can work something out. If not, waste of $3.00!"
1,DEFECTIVE,"Got the item on time. Plugged it in, worked fine until I stopped the car. Started the car again, and then I was getting a very loud screeching noise. Tried it in another car with a different media (IPHONE instead of Blackberry), same problem. Now, no more noise, but it does'nt work anymore. To much of a hassle to send it back, since I'm across the border in Canada.My loss I guess!"
1,Poor Quality,"I ordered this it, but unfortunately the first one did not work- from the get-go, it had so much static and one could not hear the music. I called the CS, and I got a free replacement (customer service is excellent; however, sad to say, the second one only worked for fifteen minutes then it became ""staticky"". During the time it worked, the sound output was great; nonetheless, it still had static. I thought that my system may have had a problem, but after testing two others from two different people, I realized that something is definitely wrong with this product. I would definitely not recommend it, but I would recommend the store/merchant-very good customer service!!!"
2,"good fidelity, but rattling noises from cassette","I decided to purchase this cassette-to-mp3 adapter after having tried an FM transmitter and getting too much interference/noise. The audio fidelity of this adapter is good, but its cassette mechanism makes a lot of rattling and clicking noises. I ended up buying a cassette-to-mp3 adapter made by Phillips (SAA2051H/17). The mechanical noise from the Phillips adapter is noticably lower, while it too has good fidelity, and the cost was also low (I paid $9 for a new one).By the way, the Belkin XM adapter did not come in manufacturer's packaging (not a good sign), and there is no Belkin or other labeling on it other than the XM logo. The Phillips adapter I bought from another vendor came in the manufacturer's high quality, unopened packaging."
2,Item are different from picture,"The cassette adapter I received is not in the box, it's in a plastic bag . No instruction or anything, I compare the adapter with the picture the seller povided and notice on the picture it have the NOTE: instruction on how to use the adapter print on it. The adapter I received don't have the NOTE: print on it. Sound quality is ok, same quality as a cassette itseft. So I suspect this adapter may not be a real one, could be FAKE,"
5,It works well,It works supper well better then the radio transmitter buy it. The sound is as good with no skips or anything
5,Awesome,It definitely gets the job done and is not fuzzy and does not have any static like my previous adapters. I was actually surprised at how well it sounded for being so cheap. Awesome so far!
5,Just what I needed for an old iPod in an old truck.,This is an excellent product and will provide you with much better sound than FM transmitters of which I've had a few.
5,Works Perfect.,"I bought this to replace a Sony version that I was borrowing from someone. The Sony always got stuck in the tape deck because the cable ran out the top of the cassette and would get caught. On the Belkin Xm, the cable comes directly out the back of the cassette so it ejects perfectly and won't wear on the cable over time.It sounds perfect. I am using it with an iPod touch and often listen to podcasts and music. There is no background noise, it plays evenly in all speakers and does exactly what it is made to do. No reason to pay any more than 5.99 to get your electronic device playing through your car stereo.The cord is really long, in fact it's a bit too long for my purposes but I simply used a twisty tie to keep it from getting tangled. However, it would be nice for anyone who wants to hand control of the mp3 player to the person in the backseat."
3,"Sounded great in one car, didn't work in another","Worked great in the cassette player in my Acura. I heard a loud hissing from the speakers, but when I turned up the volume on the iPhone and turned down the volume on the car stereo, it went away. The sound was very good. This device did not work in the cassette player of my Ford Windstar. The cassette player did not recognize that there was anything in the deck. If it works for you, then I'd give it 5 stars; obviously 0 stars if it doesn't work."
4,Cassette adapter for iphone,Product was as described. Sounds great! Would recommend for purchase for anyone needing an adapter to listen to their iphone music.
4,I Would Recommend,"The Belkin Auto Cassette Adapter is certainly worth its value. The sound quality is surprising clear for a device of this nature. The high and mid frequency response is exceptional. This really surprised me as it sounds as good as playing a CD. The low frequency is not as good though. On most songs, I have to set my car deck to the highest bass setting. The quality of the bass response is good, its just that the level is a bit low. Another good thing about this adapter is the very low backgroud noice it produces. This pleased me a great deal because the adapter I used previously was horrible in this regard.The only challenge I have with using this adapter is that I have to insert it a couple of times before it will stay in the deck. I will put it in the deck, the player will try to load it but after a few seconds, eject the adpater. I have to try a few times before it eventually stays. Even so, I consider it a worthwhile purchase. BTW, I use it with an Apple Ipod Touch G4."
5,Great for My VW!,"This worked perfectly in my 01 Jetta. The Jetta has a great sound system and I did not want to replace it. Great quility, easy to use and works perfectly with my droid phone. Good buy, cheap and fast."
2,Loud Clicking Noise,"Makes a loud clicking noise in my car cassette player. The clicking is easily audible through my music, even when playing the music at the loudest level I can tolerate. I am someone who can usually tune out extraneous noise easily. However, the clicking gets quite annoying very quickly. On the positive side, the product arrived quickly and the sound quality is otherwise good."
4,Works Great if your car is adaptable to it,"There are many mixed reviws on this, but since it was only $3 i thought why not. I got it and it didnt work in my car('99 Toyota Solara). I tried it in a friends car and it worked perfectly :( Lucky friend of mine. I gave it to him and it has GREAT sound quality...Sad that i couldnt use it in my car, but at least i could give it to a friend, and it was only $3 so i wasnt really losing very much money. If this were more around $15 i would not buy it if i didnt know if it worked. But i would just give it a try."
2,Poor Sound Quality,"I bought this because the original XM adapter cassette I received with my radio about 7 years finally wore out. This adapter seemed a lot cheaper. The quality was poor, and the sound quality was pretty bad. It works without problem, it just doesn't sound good."
4,XM Cassette,"This device allows me to play my external XM Radio System clearly through my car's stereo system. Out was ready to install, easy to use and plays clearly."
1,Poor Sound Quality,"The sound quality on this is terrible. I have an old Sony cassette adapter that is almost 20 years old and it sounds great. I got this for my wife's car and it's terrible. I ordered the Phillips one instead and it sounds fine. I would return it, but it's probably not worth the postage. Don't waste your money on this one."
2,Disappointing,"It worked great the first few times. I was surprised how well it worked until it started making a clicking sound and it would not play anything. It was only $4, so what can you expect."
5,great product at a great price,"I have purchased many of these cassette adapters in stores for much more money that did not work as well as this specific adapter. At about $5 I did not expect the adapter to work so well! I am currently using it in an older Toyota Sienna with an iPod touch and it sounds great. The bass does get distorted if the volume on the iPod is too high, but is assuaged by lowering the volume a bit.This is a great adapter, and for $5 I couldn't be happier. Just keep in mind to not have the source volume too high, and if you hear distortion dial back the volume on your source a bit."
2,Not what I expected,"Within a few weeks it stopped working. I would plug it in and the music would play and my the mode would go from TAPE to FM radio. It was getting jammed in my tape player, therefore I had to fiddle around with ALL the buttons instead of just the eject button.I don't recommend this product at all."
2,Worked for about 5 days,Worked pretty good for five days. Cheaply made plastic pieces inside broke and it would no longer play music. Not even worth returning.
4,It Works,"Not much to say about this product - it works fine, sound is good, and I now have Pandora in my car via my iPhone. Can't beat the price."
2,ONE worked well,"I ordered two of these just in case...It was a good thing I did as well, as one of them was broken. When I put it in my player, it made the player cycle back and forth from forward and backward play. It was incredibly annoying, as I could hear audio of 5 seconds, then nothing, then audio for 5 more seconds. At first I thought it was a function of my tape player, but then I decided to give the second one a shot, and it works like a charm. Not sure what is wrong with the first one, but at that price, I guess you get what you pay for."
1,Very Bad,There is constant noise coming through it while music is on. It's so irritating. Totally disaster.. Disappointing so much..not even worth it for free.
2,Low Quality Audio,I've tried two different brands of these and neither works well. You have to be desperate to play your ipod music to use one of these. Better to save your money for a new radio that has the proper connectors included. That's what I'm doing.
2,I should have splurged.,"I bought this because it was the cheapest tape deck adapter on Amazon. It performs like it. The cord is thin and feels like I may break it easily. The sound quality is subpar. My cheapo Wal Mart brand adapter sounded great, it was as good through the car speakers as a CD. With this unit, I get static, hissing, pops, and scratchy audio. Also, somehow, the levels are off. I've had to tweak all the settings on my stereo to make my music even passable. I will be replacing this one at my earliest opportunity, and recommend you spend a couple bucks more."
1,Wrong item,Ordered the Belkin XM adapter...received a Phillips version...realize they are universal...but had picked the Belkin based on reviews and previous experience...the Phillips is quite 'tinny.'
4,****,"Four Stars!!!!! 18 more words required, 14 more words required, 10 more words required, 6 more words required, I'm done!"
1,Did not work,"Sigh. The 3rd in a series of worthless cassette adapters (3 different brands) I've bought from Amazon trying to replace one wonderful one I bought years ago. Maybe I just got a bad apple, but who knows. It had a very loud hiss in the background and the volume would only go up to ""barely audible."" I just threw it away (I was tired of returning them)."
4,Everything I could want from an audio adapter but initailly deffective gear,I use this both in my ford truck tape deck and mid 90s RCA boomboox. Initially one of the gears had a small piece of plastic attached to it which prevented it from turning freely. After removing the screws on the back of the adapter and shaving the defective gear with a knife the gears rotated smoothly. During the repair period I did discover that using the pause button on the tape deck allowed the adapter to still play even with out the heads spinning which is also helpful on older tape decks where the spinning mechanism might be broken or dirty. Since the initial repair the adapter has worked perfectly for connecting my I phone 3S to both audio systems. The flexability of being able to secure the cord to either side of the tape adapter is a huge plus allowing the wire to be less cumbersome when inserting it in different directions. The mini plug has a nice click and secure fit into the iphone and the clarity seems perfect.
4,Slightly noisy,"Like any cassette player, this adapter makes a little gear noise when operated. Works well to plug an MP3-4 player into an old car!"
5,Love it to death.,I use it very often. A must if you don't have a factory MP3 player. Good quality for the price.
1,waste of money!!!,"The saying you get what you pay for truly applies for this product. The sound quality is horrible, music plays unclear with lots of static. I chose this product over the monster brand because of its great product reviews but now im definitely regretting it."
1,Auto reverses and ejects,"The sound quality was very poor for the 5 seconds this played my MP3 player in my car's cassette player. Then it starts auto reversing. Then it ejects. Bought one at Best Buy and the sound was great until the auto reverse started happening on that one, too."
2,Incorrect product,The product I received is not the one advertised. Buyer beware. I'm disappointed but not completely surprised. This review may change later after i've used it for a while.
4,"Worked well with iphone, but not with Galaxy S3","This worked well with iphone 4 with out any issues, but when I connected my Galaxy S3 I am getting very loud distraction sound.. I guess it works only well with iphone"
2,Unhappy,False advertising. What I received was not a Belkin product and I was overcharged even according to their catalog. Weak on high volume sound.
3,Works but not BELKIN,"The product I received was a cassette adapter however not BELKIN. The only reason I give it three stars is because it works (for now), I just would like to not be mislead on the brand I am spending my money on."
1,Waste of money.,"Worked for about 3 days, now ejects itself regularly. So frustrating. I had one made by Dynex that lasted me well over 3 years- only threw it out recently because the wires were getting frayed. Will be on the look out for a new one."
2,No Good,"I'm assuming most people that give this a good review haven't had extensive use of other cassette adapters.Basically my wire on my adapter has had enough so I looked into finding a new one online,purchased the XM considering it was a reputable company. When I got it hooked it up to my iPod the sound quality was below par. The cheap Phillips one at Wal-Mart is what I ended up getting again,(same as the old one)The sound quality was far more superior.There's possibly one out there with better sound quality. Though comparing the Phillips to this XM there's no contest. Sadly it went right in the trash it was not worth sending back as it was already very cheap,just a waste of time that I could've saved going to Wal-Mart."
1,Defective,I purchased this Cassette Adapter by XM to play my iPod in my car. Things were great for a week and then sound stopped coming out of the right speakers. I made sure it wasn't my iPod by checking the connection and trying my phone on the adapter instead. Same result. Pretty unfortunate because sound was good until it broke.
4,"Cassette Adapter, Great Quality","Pleasant surprises abound at Amazon. It's hard to rate the sound quality of a cassette adapter in a car, because the cassette deck in a noisy car isn't the best starting point, but there doesn't seem to be any significant hum or clip from this. It appears to be a good quality device, good plastic, probably a descent head component, and a good price because Belkin (for XM) probably made too many of these and the XM logo is probably the reason these are on the cheap. Pick up a few of them because $5 is cheap enough to keep one handy for travel or rental cars.Side note, what's with auto sound system manufacturers that they didn't build in an audio input back in the 1980's with the advent of the Walkman, or at least in the 1990s with portable CD players and the advent of the MP3 player. It's about a 10 cost to add a jack to a stereo in the factory, $5 for an after market adapter (like this one), or $50 plus for a professionally installed audio wiring harness."
5,this is the one you want to buy,"best value in a tape deck converter. Much better sound quality than the cheap ones I got from china off fleabay that did not even work. pay the extra $3 dollars for this.works well, good sound quality (not like playing a CD, but pretty darn good - as good as it gets for a tape converter), build quality seems decent. Don't look elsewhere, get this one."
2,not too good,"i bought this expecting there is no hassle in listening.HOwever, the cassette just keeps on rewinding and rewinding from time to time, making it hard on me to listen to my fav music.:("
2,Beware of cool weather...,"I was pleased to have this item, even at $5.00, until the weather became cool. All of sudden, my tape deck began auto-reversing because the spool became harder to turn. At first, I was concerned that my tape player had a problem, but when I checked it out with a standard music cassette, there were no such issues. It does get slightly better as my car warms up, but not enough to continue using it, as I've not had this problem with other adapters."
1,Really bad,I've been through tape adapters through the years and this is definitely the worst one I've ever used. The volume is very low and the sound quality is scratchy and muffled. It's just really bad. Don't buy it.
1,Too Cheap - Even at this price it is not worth it,"Xm Auto Cassette AdapterWithin minutes of using this product, I realized that this was too cheap and that I could not use it. Don't waste your money."
1,bad,"doesnt work, spits it out and makes a weird noise. second time i bought one. and neither of them work"
1,Does not work correctly,"From the moment I took it out of the package and put it in my car, this thing has only played the music out of the car's passenger-side speakers. Originally, I figured it might be my speakers since this thing was brand new, but the radio still works fine and I can even plug in my old cassette adapter and use that fine (the connection was a bit loose so I wanted a new one, but now I'm using that again anyways). I have tried jiggling the cord around a bit, thinking I might have gotten one with a loose connection, but haven't made any progress. I've also tried putting the tape in both ways but get the same result. I am VERY dissatisfied.If I am doing something wrong, someone please let me know how to fix it and I will get rid of the negative review. This is the first negative experience I've had with Amazon. However, I would not recommend this product to anyone."
3,okay sound,"This cassette adapter is much easier to use and sounds better than the FM transmitters. There is still some distortion, but it's not that bad."
1,Garbage,Seller shipped generic version of advertised product. Worse than the 10 year old tape adapter I already own. Poor sound quality on both sides.
4,Does what it says it does.,"No problems so far after several weeks of use. Absolutely quiet with no unexpected/unwanted ejects. The ad shows the ""XM"" logo on the cassette but the product itself came completely unbranded. Was it really an XM marketed adapter?Update:After 8 months of use, stored in a vehicle that sits outside in the heat and cold, this device still works just fine!"
2,Very scratchy sound,"This XM Cassette adapter worked great the first few times I used it. Very clear sound. After about five uses, the sound deteriorated rapidly, and now, only a month after I started using it, listening to music is mostly listening to scratchiness. There is very poor sound quality across a range of music and podcasts. I do not drive my car every day, so in total, I've probably only used the adapter 10 times. Considering my limited use, I hoped to get at least a few months out of a cassette adapter. I would not buy this one again."
2,Not as advertized,The adapter I got was not the one illustrated on this website. It was a Philips brand with a sticker on the package saying Belkin. It works fine so I just kept it instead of all the hassle of return etc. That is probably what the shipper hoped. Dissappointed!
1,Didn't work,"This tape was immediately ejected by my tape player in my car, I attempted to put in many different ways and still it was immediately ejected"
4,Good product,"The sound is ok, well is not fantastic but sounds well and is really cheap, so is definetly a bargain."
2,Great seller. Poor product.,"This is definitely a case of ""you get what you pay for"". The first adapter I got worked for about 30 minutes. After that, my cassette player would spit out the adapter every 15 seconds or so. No exactly a great way to enjoy your music. I made a claim and the seller quickly sent me a replacement adapter but the item still has problems. Every time I start my car there's either an ""error"" on my display, the tape jams, or the music only plays really soft. I would not reccommend this item, but I would happily order from the seller again."
2,It sorta works,Not sure the deal... I use it with my iPhone and iPod and it plays but only out of one speaker in my car. My other one works fine with my system.
1,Useless,"I don't think it ever actually worked, and it was just too cheap to return. I should have listened to the other reviewers."
1,Waste of money.,"This thing is a piece of junk. I bought because an older one I had was worn out. Since this new one just caused my tape player to display an error message, I decided to take it apart and swap the new cable with the damaged cable on my old unit. This thing has no guts compared to my old unit which has 2 resistors, 2 capacitors and a much thicker cord. The wire on the cord was so flimsy, that I couldn't even swap it with my old unit.Don't waste your money on this. Spend at least $10 for a good one."
2,Hit and miss,"This product worked great the first time I used it. But it seems like every time I start my car the quality changes. One day its crystal clear, one day it sounds like the music is being played through a walkie talkie...Im not very satisfied with this product."
1,Product did not work,This didn't work in my 1999 Toyota Corolla. The lyrics could not be heard while playing my iphone through this cassette adapter.
3,Worked for a little while....,"Now I have to tug the cord to the side to make the sound come out of the left speakers in my car. If left as is with no fiddling with the cord, only sound plays through the right side speakers. It's inconvenient, but it still works. I just have to keep tugging on it every few minutes."
1,Has a loud clicking sound,Makes a gear griding/popping sound about twice a second. Also causes my deck to auto reverse now and then and eject the tape.
5,So relieved!,This device works perfectly even with my crappy old IPod. Which makes me very happy because I just bought a new IPod so I won't have to wonder if I'll be disappointed in this product. It arrived well packaged and ON TIME!
2,Noisy,"I can hear the reels moving/grinding/squeaking quite loudly. It works fine and isn't as noticeable with the volume up, but it can be very annoying at times. My old Maxell adapter didn't have this problem in the same car. I do not recommend purchasing this product."
2,Decent sound quality but it only lasted me a week,"I bought this thinking it would be a nice cheap alternative to buying a whole new stereo system with an auxillary port just to play my mp3s in my car. it was actually a pretty decent sound quality compared to other cassettes and even some fm transmitters. The only problem I had was the build quality, as soon as I took it out of it's packaging a piece of plastic chipped off on it's own. Then a week later the case came undown and now I'm left with a mess to clean out of my tape deck. 2 in my opinion is very generous for this adapter."
1,Its not a low rating because its a bad product,"I'm among those people who got the Panisonic one as opposed to this Belkin one that I was promised. Don't get me wrong, the Panisonic one is okay and more or less does what I want it to do, but I was expecting the Belkin one and, to be honest, somewhat excited for it.I guess for the price, I really can't complain too much. Just remember that this rating is not based around how bad the Belkin one is, just that I didn't actually get it and got another one instead."
1,CRAPPY ADAPTER,IT WORKED FOR 3 WEEKS AND THEN ONLY THE RIGHT SPEAKERS WORKED. BUY A BETTER QUALITY ONE. I ENDED UP BUYING IMONSTER ADAPTER THAT WORKS 200 TIMES BETTER.
4,Good product,"First time I used it, the sound was distorted and sounded very bad. After lowering the volume on my iPhone to about half it sounded perfect. Very happy with the purchase."
1,Doesn't work!,"After reading the mixed reviews, I took a chance on this item... It simply doesn't work in my car. The auto-reverse keeps clicking back and forth and then ejects the tape..."
1,DOA,"It was DOA from a torn cable. Cheap enough I didn't bother with an RMA, but certainly not a high-quality item."
1,sux,"It sux. Plain and simple. Constant buzzing sound, and would repeatedly skip sides, never allowing a smooth flow of music. Meant to ask for a refund or replacement, but since it was so cheap I just trashed it. See for yourself, it just sux."
2,Pavillion supplied PHILIPS adapter- then refunded me,"== My original review is below this comment: I stated the brand of adapter was switched which disappointed me greatly. Pavillion issued a refund and an apology which was a proper business response.While I am still sorry not to have had the correct product I was glad they were responsive. ==ORIGINAL COMMENTSI purchased from Pavillion because their ad copy clear stated, and the photo also represented, a BELKIN brand MP3 adapter which is more desirable than a Philips product they supplied. This type of adapter can be prone to cord and shell problems galore and I wanted a top quality brand to avoid these headaches. This dealer switched the brand the supplied and sent a cheaper product from another manufacturer."
4,great value,"This is such a convenient way to listen to my ipod or pandora on my phone. The sound quality isn't quite as clean as I'd hoped, but it was awfully close, so I'm pretty happy with it. At this price, I don't think it can be beat!"
3,To be fair...,"This is not working properly in my car with iPod attached. It starts playing music, stops, reverses, starts again, stops, reverses, etc. To be fair, it could be the cassette system in the car. I guess I will need to buy another to see."
1,Cassette Tape,"Bought this for my girlfriend and when we popped it in the car, all we heard was static. The problem with the tape was that the cord was damaged in the mail. Does not work at all."
1,Terrible,It did not work at all. It woul play music for a minute then pop out.... Even if it did play music it would make a clicking sound and the audio was terrible. Don't buy it and bite the bullet and buy a higher end product
1,Don`t Buy this,I thought i had a good deal when i purchased this but problem is it keeps cutting in and out when im trying to play my music and i won`t buy this again i was very disappointed
1,not worth it,This worked great the first few times then it started making a loud clicking noise. It didn't cost much and wasn't work the time or money to return it so I just trashed it.
3,"Great buy, not made to last though.","I bought this about 2 years ago when I started driving. When I first used it, it gave me a very trebley sound. I just played around with the EQ on my iPod and the car and it worked fine. It worked for a few months, but then the cable started to be very troublesome. It would only work if I held the cable bent at certain angles, but that was ridiculous to do when driving. I guess that happened from putting my iPod in the cup holder and bending the cable. If you can keep the cable straight, it is a great buy!"
4,Great for the price,"I must say this product is awsome. I havent tried any other adapter from another brand but this one gets the job done pefectly. I first tried it in my girlfriends Accord and it was great, now I use it on my Acura RSX and it tunes beutifully with Bose audio system. I recommend this product to everyone."
2,Terrible sound quality.,"Bought this for my Saab with a nine-speaker Harman/Kardon sound system. My glorious sounding audio system was reduced to quality lesser than a cheap boom box from the mid-1980s with this adapter. It only played through two of the nine speakers and you could barely hear it. After working with the settings on my iPod and sound system to no avail, I decided to just pitch it in the trash.I hope it was just that I got a faulty one or something along those lines, but my experience with this product was very poor."
4,Good value,Bought to replace an old unit and this one worked well. The audio output is a little lower than the old one but not enogh to be a problem. Recommended.
4,Casset adaptor for iPod iPhone,It is very simple and works well especially with iPhone4. Shipment is also quick enough and prompt.The sound is better with iPhone than iPod
3,Not iphone compatible,"Ordered this after reading some of the reviews saying that it worked with ipod, but it will not work with my iphone. The plug is wrong on the end. I gave it 3 stars just as a middle of the road, since it doesn't work with my phone, I can't speak to whether it works well or not. Not the sellers fault, I should have researched better. Shipping was quick though."
4,Great Product!,I would have to say that after trying this product out in my car..it's amazing. The sound quality is pretty decent and I have no complaints so far.
4,Works!!,"It works as expected. Nothing more, nothing less. What a great utilization of the otherwise obsolete tape deck! Go for it!"
4,2 months later...still no problems!,"It provides good sound quality, and i have to experience any audio issues with its use. I use it in conjuction with my Volvo S80, and a Pandigital Tablet i use for music, 2 months later...still no problems! (4 stars)"
2,Cheap,The good news is that it is very simple and very inexpensive. The bad news is that it sounds terrible. It sounds muffled and there is a hum.
3,so so,it works but like some have said when a song is not playing it will have that hissing sound. would give it top rating if it did't have the sound
2,Not so great.,"I ordered these and it worked great for about 2 months. Then the sound started going bad...sometimes it would only play on one side of the car stereo or the sound was fuzzy. Then it stopped working completely. I bought another one and it did the same thing, this time it only lasted for two weeks though. Very disappointed with the product."
2,"Very Disappointed. Plays out of only 1 speaker,","Very Disappointed because it has highly recommended. Plays out of only 1 speaker. In the car and other cassette players I own, still plays out of just 1 speaker."
5,works perfect in my '98 toyota camry!,"bought this and was a little hesitant with my cassette player never being used before.. but it works great! sound quality is great, only time i hear a buzz is with my lower quality songs. its perfect for my drive to school.. super happy with the product!"
1,Does not work? What is the point of it,"I place it in my console and it makes a few noises then pops back out. I looked up troubleshooting tips to no avail. I tried a normal cassette and it worked so i know it is not my player. Product is useless, definitely don't buy."
2,Value for money - exactly!!,"For $3.75 it is Value for money - exactly!!worked for few days, had a distinct hum in the background - may be from day 2.One hot summer day left it in the car seat and after that it would not work - meaning it will constantly try forward and backward and eject."
5,Great advice from sophomores to freshmen!!!,"What a great idea--- students advising students on the freshman year in high school. This book is full of wonderful advice; the students have really researched their topics, and they know what they are writing about. Every high school, middle school, and public library should have copies of this invaluable book! How lucky these students are to have a teacher like Dawn Burnette. Keep up the great work!"
4,Please explain,"I work in a Ninth Grade Academy. We have this book on our shelves. It is a fantastic book for Freshman. It is engaging and on their ""level"". But...Can someone tell me why the price on this book is so high? I can't seem to find any information on the reason for the increase."
5,"Great gear, impressive prices and very fast shipping",As good as a Columbia if not better for less than 25% of the price. Need I say more?
2,Not enough detail/Priced too high,"I'm not sure if I missed something or not but I could not find the size of the canisters listed anywhere. As far as price, I was in a Kohl's Department store yesterday and the same canisters without the wine sealer was less. On another web site without the wine sealer it was less. I do not drink wine and really do not want the wine sealer.ThanksCharlotte Spencer"
2,Does not hold seal.,"I love the Vacu Vin wine bottle stoppers, so a year ago I purchased the marinator and a set of canisters. Big mistake. I can't get the seal to hold most of the time. This happened after a few uses, so it's not that they're old or anything. Every month or so I give it another try, to no avail. The seal and edges are clean, and I can't figure out what to do."
3,nice saree!!,In the picture this saree looks very expensive but in real life it's not so. But the color is beautiful and saree is beautiful too but the prize is little higher then the quality.
5,"Ghost Dogs ... Good, Family Fun","I worked this by myself, but ended up needing the help of my daughters (12, 10), and we had a GREAT time working on the mystery together ... with a cold winter, nothing like some shivers up your spine with a little mystery solving! It's one of those things, once you start, you can't put it down until you've solved the mystery. Excellent for puzzle-solving and a few shivers as well. Love it!"
5,Still playing this one...,"Another success for Dreamcatcher. Please keep making them :) This game is a bit scarier than previous games, so keep that in mind when purchasing for younger kids. At one point, you are required to go to the graveyard and snoop and if that is not bad enough, later you have to go back in the dark. To add to the intensity, it's like a maze to even get out there and back... ever tried doing a maze in the dark??A Very good game so far - has kept my interest and my mind engaged. From an adult who loves mysteries, that is saying a LOT about a kids' game :)"
4,Surprising,This game was great. The theme was awesome the graphics were great. I have 5 nancy drew games. And I realized when I finished this game that it was short. I finished it in 2 long sittings. But I was amazed because usually nancy drew games are difficult for me and I would have to download the strategy guide. But with this game it was simple. When I was done I sat open mouth thinking thats it!?:( Usually it takes me a couple of weeks before I finish games. I thought that this game didnt have alot of puzzles also. But overall this game was good. I enjoyed it but In my mind I thought there has to be more. But you should still get this game. If you are a beginner this is a great game to play. HINT: BEFORE GOING IN THE WOODS LOOK IN THE CABINET OVER THE SINK AND GET A MAP. TRUST ME YOU DO NOT WANT TO GO OUT THERE WITHOUT MAP. ALSO THERE ARE ALOT OF TURNS. SO YOU SHOULD HAVE SOMEONE HELP YOU IF YOU ARE LITTLE. Hope I helped!
4,ghost Dogs review,"This game was very fun. It gets sorrta scary too, which makes it more fun. There was alot of suspense in this game. When you find out who the culprit is you'll be very surprised. Everyone seems suspicious so you never know what to ask!Have Fun!"
5,Coolest game eva!,"I love the nancy drew series and ghost dogs of moon lake was awesome! i did get stuck on some parts, but its fun, and has great graphics. All of the other ones were great too."
5,"Kind of creepy but, very entertaining","In the begining of the game you arrive at your friend Sally McDonald's cottage/house at Moon Lake. You see her note and find out that she has abandoned you. She calls and tells you she's sorry (that's not good enough for me). You hear noises outside so naturally you go outside to find out what it is. You meet some wierd guy named Red Knott (strange isn't it). You talk to him and find out about the ""gost dogs"". Then the real fun starts. You go back inside because you hear the dogs howling in the distance. So you got a mysterie on your hands. The game is very exciting and has some creepy parts to it (including the cemetary on your property). I enjoyed playing this game and it is a bit less challenging than the other Nancy Drew games. This game deffinitly deserves 5 stars."
1,not a good game,"i thought that this game was awful.. it was wicked boring and there weren't many places to go and people to see. Mainly you were stuck on the lake and you had a boat to go to like two other places. To me having a lot of places to go is fun and this was not. Me and my friend did it in about 4 hours.. a waste of money and a waste of time, since it was suppose to be at least 21 hours of fun. A much better one i reccomend is Message in a Haunted Mansion. One other awful ones are danger on deception island (which i didn't even finish it was so bad). The others werent as bad though"
3,not good as a gift,"The weld had popped off one end of one of the cross-wires, and one of the cups had a spot of rust that caused the non-stick coating to bubble and flake off. Neither of these defects are cause for returning the pan since it is for my own use - it will still work just fine - but it would not be acceptable to give as a gift.There was no problem with the packaging, the delivery was prompt, and when I contacted the seller to warn him of these issues, he was most appreciative. He would have replaced the item instantly if I had requested it. But, well...Made in China...caveat emptor. If you need a perfect pan, ask the seller to inspect it first."
2,Cheap,"Overall cheap product. Ordered three, one cup needed to be spot welded upon arrival, the other two that I have started to use, the non stick surface has already begun to flake. Ultimately, spend more money on a better product. I have moved onto cast iron."
5,Great pan!,This is a great quality pan. I've made several batches of popovers and the pan is great. I just need to perfect my popover skills as they are very touchy to make!
5,Norpro popover pan,We had popovers before and my wife wanted to make some - this popover pan was exactly the size she wanted and made just the right sized popovers. Great item
2,Quite Disappointing,This book really disappointed me. Dr. Dobson took over eighty (80) pages to say basically one thing: don't mistake infatuation for true love.
3,little banged up,Product did not come packaged very good. Little pieces of the enamel had broken off and I had to try and glue back on. I also had to buy some paint to try and cover the pieces that were too small. I did not contact the company though to report the damages just fixed it myself.
2,OK but not worth it,this product makes your skin soft but does nothing for wrinkles and lines. Where is the truth in advertising? I would not buy this again since I find no difference in my skin after using it.
2,"Like Aveeno, but better age-defying products available","I use Aveeno lotion as my everyday regular moisturizer. For whatever reason it is the only cream my face accepts without causing pimples or flakes. At age 29 I've decided it's time to start an anti-aging regimine and it made sense to me to start with what Aveeno offers. I have this product and I have several Olay products (for eye, thermal peel, and the tinted concealer) and this by Aveeno seems to be performing the least. I've noticed it can dry out my skin, and I've yet to see a change in my skin from this lotion.That said, I've not tried Olay's anti-aging lotions, but I can say their Thermal Mini-Peel and under eye products are working enough for me to keep buying!"
5,Punchy!,"Can't believe I had the same bass beater for 15 years! This one is great, sturdy and will probably last another 15. I probably should have bought one from my local drum store, but I did just buy a new Zildjian cymbal and was feeling frugal."
2,To The Limit : The Don Henley Selective Memory Memoirs,"As an Eagles fan, I began reading this book with high hopes. But then reality set in. ""To The Limit"" centers around Don Henley, and must have been written with his cooperation because stunningly, no mention is made of Henley's scandal with the two girls in a hot tub, which made headlines and inspired his songs ""Nobody's Business"" and ""Dirty Laundry."" Joe Walsh is all but ignored, which is strange since he is the group's most popular member. All in all, it sounds like the book was dictated by Henley. The ""Untold"" stories of the Eagles in this book are the stories of any band member not named Frey or Henley."
3,Take it Easy with all the record business details,Having been a major Eagles fan and not really knowing much about them I read this book.I did learn some things however I was also somewhat dissapointed.To the Limit focuses way too much on the internal workings of the recording business.Although we need to understand some of the workings of the business I found myself getting bored with all the details of managers producers and executives of the record business.I was hoping to learn more about the songs of the Eagles.I wanted to know how Hotel California was conceived.I found it odd that Marc mentions nothing about Felders contribution to the song[Hotel California] and very little about his musical contributions in general.I also would have liked to hear from Frey first hand rather than just a few second hand quotes.The Eagles have always been primarily about the music.I just wish this book focused more on the music.
2,There was something in here untold?,"File this book under ""heard it all before"". This book is little more than a Don Henley puff piece with a picture or two thrown in. Approximately a third of the book concerns itself with blbliography, the index, and what has to be the most incredibly overstated discography ever to grace a book of this type. Not only do you get an Eagles discography, but also one on each band member, INCLUDING any and all side projects they ever appeared on. There's very little new in here, in fact, there's very little in here at all, which leads one to believe that the Eagles were one of the most boring bands ever to survive to tiresome middle age. The only book I've read of this ilk that I consider worse is the Zep book by their former road manager. Do yourself a favor and do like I did, check this out of the library when you're sick, it's nasty out, and you'll be in bed anyway, only don't block off a large amount of time."
2,Forget It - and buy Don Felder's book!,"I found this book rather cynical and a bit too Henley centric (maybe because Henley granted interviews and the others didn't) - but I got the feeling of biting the hand that feeds you was here.Writing style is average (being a published author of several rock n roll books I have a right to that judgement) and others have already pointed out obvious errors and ommissions, which I won't repeat here.I got rid of my copy.If you want a good read, to laugh and to cry - get Don Felder's book. The first day I was reading that on the train I was so absorbed (and that was the pre-Eagles section on the David Blue / CSN era) I missed my stop and was late for work ...."
1,An Unfortunate Wasted Time,"While the Eagles are surely worth a comprehensive, accurate and historical review, To the Limit is not that book. Eliot's look at the LA music scene in the 70's and the music business are the book's only redeeming features. New fans to the band should be warned there are plenty of factual errors here -- the Superbowl has never been played in October, for instance -- and the text focuses heavily on Henley and Frey. Perhaps the publisher was so busy lawyering the book because of Henley's outcries, copy editing was ignored. In addition, while Eliot acknowledges assistance from Joe Walsh, who gets very little attention (as does Timothy B.), Walsh's management denies he ever spoke with Eliot or participated in the book in any way. Perhaps if fans really want to know the Eagles, they'd be better off listening to their music. Thankfully I borrowed my copy instead of paying for it. Hard to believe they killed trees for this."
2,nothing really new,"if you're looking for the dirt on the sex and the drugs, its tamed down. if you're looking for the conflict between geffon, the band, the managers and irv azoff, its toned down. the book comes down to henley and frey became starts, didn't think they received the respect they thought they deserved and were angry about it. but it does have a complete discophraphy of all members of the band."
3,Reads like a textbook,"After reading Don Felder's whiny autobiography, I thought this might provide some objective views on the Eagles. It does for the most part, but there are glaring errors throughout that any person with cursory knowledge of the Eagles will see immediately. Also, it almost reads like a textbook in some places, as if this book was written for an Eagles 101 course. The author doesn't help his cause by writing an addendum dumping on Don Henley, who apparently was not pleased with the book. And the fact that there is no first-hand information from Glenn Frey doesn't help either. The bottom line is that it's interesting, but not as good as I had hoped."
3,"Great music, not so great personalities","As a fan of the music of The Eagles, I am very glad I never had to spend one minute in the same room with any of these obnoxious, egotistical and petty men. Tension between members of rock groups is common, but Henley and Frey brought it to new heights. The text was entertaining and even touched upon a little rock history(California sound), but by far the best part of the book was the extensive discography which ran 65 pages. Now I can find the albums on CD that are missing from my collection. I must stop reading about the lives of rock musicians so I can continue to enjoy the music. I'll probably never be able to listen to The Eagles again without a slightly slanted view of the group."
5,Beautiful table! My daughter loves it!,This table is beautiful. We bought it for my daughters 4th birthday present. It is very well made with solid construction and the paint is flawless. We also bought the matching chairs and they are also very good quality. It was very easy to assemble. Well worth the money. The little jewelry box is my daughters absolute favorite. We put this in her room after she fell asleep so she would wake up on her birthday morning and see it but instead we woke up at 3 am and found her having a full fledge tea party with stuffed animals and all.
1,Rediculously slow on my new Macintosh,"This title runs rediculously slow on my new Macintosh. Some of the mini-games take 10 minutes or more to complete (race-a-long, for example)!!! Stay away from this dog."
4,Love the Seasons,"I agree with the reviews that Four Seasons is a little tight, that you're not sure which clothes go with which season(coordinate by color), and when Caillou spins (in the racing game) it's suppose to be a bad thing; however, my son and I LOVE this CD. He is 5, and we love discussing the seasons of the year and learning the exciting characteristics of each. I haven't seen any other software that teaches this. See-saw, build a snowman, rake leaves, ice skate, and roller blade thru the year. As you work thru the activities you collect items for your ""Nature Book."" When you've completed a season you can print the nature book, staple, and color. My son loves Four Seasons, and I reminisce about going through the seasons in my own childhood. Educational, fun, sweet - you can't miss!"
4,Season Sensation!,"While there are some valid points to the earlier criticsm of Caillou Seasons this is really a fun program that offers kids tons of choices. I bought this for my neice and ended up being the hero of the birthday party. The game is really cute and held her attention as well as bringing about lots of discussion about the various seasons, her likes and dislikes about them and plans for the upcoming fall. It looks like it will be Caillou for Christmas if I want to keep my prefered uncle status going. Just hope my brother and his wife can cope with the theme song that gets stuck in your head."
2,scisors,"They are ok, but hard to use on construction paper. I have found other products to work much better."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"A so-so book about a computer geek guy that ends up sucked into his own computer world. He ends up getting to play some pretty cool computer games for real, though, even if the stakes are really a little on the high side for your average game geek's fancy.You won't just be losing your twenty cent piece to the Galaga machine here."
1,"a waste of money....worse, a waste of time",i found this book boring. it also went beyond my ability to suspend disbelief.
1,Has he lost his touch?,"I found this book incredibly boring and difficult to follow, and I'm a huge LN fan. I do not recommend this to anyone."
1,Poor,"This is actually a fantasy book disguised as SF. That, of itself, isn't a bad thing. But Niven's writing style is very disjointed and erratic; it has none of the polish that his novels with Jerry Pournelle (and Steve Barnes) have. It's as if Niven is writing with a wink and a nod to his huge fan base--the wink being for ""in"" jokes and a nod given to the hard-core fan who understands what he's writing about. He writes in such a way as to leave things out, such as transitional phrases or descriptions, assuming (I think) that the reader will fill in the rest. This was an awful book in a great package. Tor seems to be doing this lately: great packages for lousy novels (Card is one, Williamson is another)."
1,Mixture of Old (Wonderful) and New (Lackluster),"Larry Niven has written some wonderful books featuring some of the best ideas in science fiction. This book is half-and-half. The wonderful part contains a handful of delightful short stories from his 1976 book ""Flight of the Horse,"" now sadly out of print. The not-so-wonderful is an almost unreadable new novella set in the same universe. Mars is popular these days, and Niven should have been able to do a smash-bang job of working it into the ""Horse"" universe. Instead, he wrote a lot of dismal dialog and murky exposition with none of the life of the older stories (which I eagerly reread, confirming that they've stood the test of time).I could give this a mixed review: a compromise between five stars for the old material, and one star for the new. But save your money and look for a used copy of ""Flight of the Horse."" And shame on Niven's publisher for not just reissuing a great older book and leaving well enough alone."
1,Ripped off,"I seldom buy hardbacks since very few are worth the price. The exception is anything from Larry Niven. I have always purchased his hardback first editions as soon as they are released. Especially when he makes the effort to write on his own and not with that idiot Pournelle. Rainbow Mars was a mistake. A marginal work at best and only half the book. He reprints some old ho hum work from his early days to fill space. If you have to read it, wait for a used paperback edition."
2,A collection of Time Travel Tales,"Each of the stories in this book, some of which were previously published as shorts in magazines, centers on a xenophobic and somewhat reluctant time traveler being sent through time to find things to appease/entertain the ruler and/or encourage funding for the time travel agency he works for. But unbeknownst to him or his agency, he is being sent not just backwards and forwards in time but sideways to parallel universes populated with creatures from myth and fiction.The concept is interesting and it could have made for a very whimsical series of tales. Somehow it falls short. The potential isn't realized. Niven, a highly competent science fiction writer, was apparently trying to stretch himself to write fantasy after meeting with Terry Pratchett but Niven simply does not have Pratchett's skill with words and ideas necessary to pull this off."
2,"Niven - 75% new, the rest old.","Thinking that this would be a good Niven tale I sprang for the full hard cover book. The main novel ended abruptly after 224 pages. The story could have been finished with success at Mars, leaving room for future work. Instead the remaining ninety pages are filled with reprints of old short stories on Svetz's time travels. I was very disappointed, if I could of opened a window on the jet I would of thrown it out."
1,Very confusing and not a lot of fun.,"I picked up Rainbow Mars without having read the earlier stories and found this book confusing and worse, boring. I did not care about the environment or the world in which it took place. I put the book down halfway and do not care to finish it."
1,disappointing,"Larry Niven has written some of the best science fiction ever, but this book is very disappointing. It reads a bit like a fever dream, and is never very coherent nor logical."
2,Surprisingly Bad,"I have never written to pan a book or record before but this book was so dissappointing, and the synopsis on the back of the book was so misleading that I felt I had no choice. I have read many great books by Larry Niven, and when I read the back cover I felt that I was in for another. What I got instead was an almost incoherent jumbled chaotic mess that barely had enough to it to limp to a two star rating. I found the fantasy intrusions to be particularly annoying. I didn't buy this book to read about Unicorns, Midgard Serpents, Rocs, Dragons, etc... As a matter of fact, had I even seen the word Unicorn on the back cover I would have dropped the book like so much nuclear waste. Not to mention the absurdity of the ridiculous ""allied races"" living on the Beanstalk (hangtree) Believe everything you have read, do not buy this book."
4,I Liked It,"I've read the reviews for this book and most people seem to hate it. I'm a big Niven fan and despite the reviews, I read the book anyway and I enjoyed it. Yes it's odd that the 3rd 1/3 of the book is a collection of short stories that is not noted anywhere on the cover. But I did enjoy reading the main story quite a bit."
1,Terrible,"I am a Larry Niven fan and liked most of his books. (Integral Trees was mediocre, but I finished.) However, I gave up on this book pretty soon, and I almost never give up on a book before finishing. I returned it to the library after I started the very confusing time/space (?) travel to Mars (?) chapter. Maybe I should have followed some of the other reviewers advise and read the short stories first so I could understand what was going on. The dialoge was trite and unbelievable. Even for science fiction/fantasy, none of the concepts made any sense.I consider myself even dumber for having wasted 1/2 hour on starting this book."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"A collection of Svetz stories, taking those that were in Flight of the Horse and adding the title story from much later, basically. It is also a short novel. A brief Svetz timeline is given before the other stories.Rainbow Mars : Rainbow Mars - Larry NivenRainbow Mars : The Flight of the Horse - Larry NivenRainbow Mars : Leviathan! - Larry NivenRainbow Mars : Bird in the Hand - Larry NivenRainbow Mars : There's a Wolf in My Time Machine - Larry NivenRainbow Mars : Death in a Cage - Larry NivenGoing for a Barsoomy feel with a really big tree3 out of 5I wish he would get his own bloody unicorn.3.5 out of 5Appearances in the record should not be taken as gospel for massive mythical monsters.3 out of 5Roc the plasma.3.5 out of 5Werewolf girl following time.3 out of 5Don't see this doctor.2.5 out of 52.5 out of 5"
2,Hard or Soft Science?,"I found myself having difficulty classifying this book. From its lingering descriptions of the bizarre things going on, I at first assumed that it was 'hard sci-fi' where the scientific speculation is more important than the plot. But the science is ludicrous! It's filled with the kind of hand-waving one sees in 'soft sci-fi' where the science is there only to further the plot, and need not be more than superficially plausible.So is the focus on the story? The story is passable but doesn't set your heart racing. The bottom line is that it doesn't take itself seriously either.What Niven seems to be going for is a conversion of fantasy and old science-fiction ideas to a modern science-fictional genre. It's an entertaining idea, but everything still ends up feeling like fantasy. He's made a few cosmetic changes, is all--what Orson Scott Card described as ""science fiction has rivets, fantasy has trees."" Rainbow Mars can't seem to do away with the trees."
3,What's to gush about?,"This isn't a bad book. The original Svetz stories are buried in the back, which makes the new material disappointingly lean by comparison. Actually, I wish the space had been used to elongate the Mars story, because there are some beautiful things in here that just seem to get hurried along. Niven's ""rationalization"" of some of Burrough's and Bradbury's material is nifty.Sadly, I can't give this book a whole-hearted recommendation, though. If it were ONLY one or two classic Martian tales in play here, it would have been better. Instead the story gets bogged down with too many things to take care of and the beautiful ideas seem lost in it. If you're a Niven fan, as many others writing reviews here are, then you'll probably like it... but not love it."
2,Niven missed....,"I'm a hardcore Niven fan and have been ever since I first read ""A Gift From Earth"", but with that said - this book is mediocre at best. I suppose it is just a matter of taste, but I found this book to be tedious and confusing. I usually appreciate his sense of humor, (anyone who hasn't read Man Of Steel/Woman of Kleenex is really missing out) but this time I have to say I just don't get it."
2,Adding a story does not make a new book,"I was pleased to see a new Niven--until I realized that this was a repackaging of The Flight of the Horse with a single new story, Rainbow Mars. The publisher's blurb makes it sound like a novel, which it is not._Flight of the Horse_ is probably out of print, so if you haven't read the Svetz stories, you may enjoy the book. They are something of a flight of fancy for Niven, not unlike the warlock stories. This is not his best sub-genre."
2,Niven needs to get back his Muse!,"I reluctanctly say this is not exactly what I expect from Niven. This is not Science Fiction as much as total Fantasy.He has created a menagerie of genres, borrowed from other writers, to create an impossible set of possibilities. Alternate time lines, unicorns, world trees, Barsoom and Megalomaniac feudal lords.I like to think of Science Fiction as a plausible future. This novel is too far removed from that premise. But this is not to say someone else might not enjoy it."
3,"An enjoyable, but short, read.","Includes an original 260 page novelette, and reprints of some short stories. I'd previously read some of the shorts in other anthologies, and felt a bit disappointed that the new novelette, although a good read if you are a Niven fan, was too short."
2,Style gets in the way of substance.,"An author is entitled to experiment. This is one a failure of style. Should the reader have to persist so far down a bad road of staccato prose that he risks ruining the suspension of disbelief, or of trust that the style will get better enough to finish the book? I don't think so. Sufficient self-indulgence merits self-publishing. Didn't and won't finish this piece of corduroy."
4,"A lot of fun, even if you don't get all the inside jokes.","I enjoyed this book, but I suspect I would've enjoyed it more if I were more familiar with the Edgar Rice Burroughs Barsoom stories. Recursive SF is like alternate history in that you have to be familiar with the original material in order to get full enjoyment out of it. Also, this is not much like most of Niven's other work, so that may be a problem for some of those who prefer only ""Hard"" science fiction. That said, I recommend this book for a quick, entertaining read. It does help, as a previous reviewer stated, to read the short stories first. In fact, I think the book should've been printed in that order."
2,Disappointing,"I felt that the story telling was rather confused, and that the premise wasn't working at novel length. Note: I re-read the older Svezt stories first, which I recommend doing to facilitate following the story better."
4,Don't listen to the naysayers -- she's the real deal.,"Ok, enough of the Donald Duck comparisons, and the (...) opinion that Macy Gray has no talent.Macy has talent aplenty. You can *not like* her voice, but to suggest that she has no talent is ridiculous. Her vocal style is different, but by no means lacking talent. She's emotive, sexual, keeps a very funky beat, and throws her confidence around in her lyrics just like you want her to.I guess the straight-laced-set might just not *get* Macy, but even that is suspicious, because several of her songs are very infectous. ""Relating to a Psychopath"" and ""Sexual Revolution"" demand multiple listenings right off the bat, and the rest of the album carries a similar theme, very listenable.Personally, I find her voice extremely emotive and pure, with a fine command of her range. To top it off, there's more intelligence within this CD than you'd expect from a typical MTV artist.And, oh yeah, the band is very tight and the sound is well-produced."
4,The Id,"I was late to purchase this CD. I started my Macy collection with Big (5 stars) and decided to keep it going. I'm glad I did. I really like this CD. I didn't care for Macy's voice when she first came out with I Try, but another reveiwer mentioned that after a while it can grow on you. And it did just that. Macy is soulful and I love her style and raspy delivery. Also her lyrics are entertaining, different, funny at times.Fave tracks:* Gimme All Your Lovin or I Will Kill You* Don't Come Around* Relating to a Psychopath* Harry* Shed (Hidden track)I think this CD is definitely worth picking up, especially at the price. I am thoroughly pleased! Go Macy~!Happy listening!"
3,Disappointment,"I really *L O V E * Macy's first album.It was different, unusual, her warm voice, the sexy lyrics, great tunes!!After I saw her performance in Israel I loved her even more - what an energy! What a performance! What a funky groove! What a WOMAN!!!I waited impatiently for her new CD, and now - there it is -Almost a copy of her debut....One or two ballads (that becoming radio and MTV hits in a week), same sexy lyrics and almost the same tunes.I don't know why I was disappointed so much - I loved her debut so what's wrong with the second if it just the same? I don't know, maybe I was waiting for some inventiveness."
3,The Id,"When I first heard Macy Gray's voice, I feared that the mass public would jump on her bandwagon because of her unique vocal styling then dump her by her second disc. I truly enjoyed her debut disc for the more soulful vibe but this one definitely had to grow on me because it exposed a lot more of her vocal weaknesses than her debut did. But what she lacks in vocal prowess was more than made up for in the funky production of the overall disc.My favorite tracks are: SWEET BABY, DON'T COME AROUND, FORGIVENESS, SEXUAL REVOLUTION & RELATING TO A PSYCHOPATH.Two other songs that I enjoyed are: HEY YOUNG WORLD PT II & HARRY (love the organs & overall music production).I like the comparison between Macy & Billie Holliday because both have very unique singing voices which may take the uninitiated a little time to truly appreciate but once you give yourself a chance & time to listen, I think you'll like more than you dislike."
3,Forgettable funk jams,"""On How Life Is"" was one of the best records of the last few years. Sadly, however, Macy Gray's follow up isn't in the same league.The songwriting is much weaker here, with most of the songs turning into old school funk jams. Luckily, I like old schoo l funk jams so the record gets a passing grade from me.Also, whoever mastered this CD needs to go back to engineering school. The record sounds like sonic mush.I thought this record would grow on me, but after several listens I've decided that it do e sn't get any better with repeated listens.Let's hope Macy hires some better songwriters and producers for her third effort!"
2,2.5 stars,"Well... at least the album has a fitting title.In the liner notes, 'the id' is defined as the actions one does before thinking. That perfectly describes this album. It sounds jumbled and very spur of the moment. She made this album before thinking about how bad it was and how it would ruin the reputation she established with her debut. Almost every song is a half-baked idea that wears out its welcome at the 2 minute mark. They are funky, I'll give them that, but otherwise this is not worth the buy. I would suggest her debut or her third album. Both are much better."
4,Sophomore slump not for Macy,"Hot on the heels of 'On How Life Is' comes Macy Gray's 2nd album, 'The Id'. And like its predecessor, this album is an impressive mix of catchy melodies, freaky lyrics and Macy's unique voice.While there really isn't anything that screams MASSIVE HIT like I Try did, there are a large number of standout tracks on the disc, with a good blend of mid and uptempo songs. The highlights on the album include the somewhat rock-y 'Relating to a Psychopath', the jaunty and fun 'Sexual Revolution' and the tender 'Sweet Baby'. However my favourite track is definitely the bizaare circus/carnival tune that is 'Oblivion', which includes sparkling lyrical gems like 'I eat my marimbas' and 'I tingle when I sing/Bling bling bling ting ting ting'.I could have done without the instrumental 'Blowin' Up Your Speakers' though, which threatens to do just that with its weird cacophony of noises.However, on the whole, this is a great album and is definitely worth spending your money on."
3,Tough act to follow,Macy Gray made the album of her career the first time out. If she had not made such a benchmark on her debut she might be getting better reviews this time out. This CD is a fine R&B album. It has 3 or 4 potential hits that will carry this CD into the best seller list for months. Is it as good as On How life is? No way. For me the two biggest problems with this Cd are 1. she was worried about making dance music and 2. There is too much B.S. bantering and tinkering within the songs. I do own this disc and will keep it in my collection because when she applies herself she still shines.
1,"ugh, she's awful","Hold your nose together, then sing: that's just about how she sings. Oh wait, the same works for Britney Spears too. Either way, they're awful!!! Why are they getting so much exposure for NO amount of talent whatsoever?? It's really sad that people can actually tolerate this."
1,Garbage,"Sore Throat + huge rotating fan + chalkboard scratching = Macy Gray. If thats music to your ears then go for it, but im just trying to save you some cash. Macy Gray is THE WORST vocalist I have EVER heard in my entire life. Professional that is. Do not support this whatchamacallit. You know what I mean but you know I can't say it. I honestly believe that my vocals screaming when I'm falling from the bridge I jumped off of after I listened to this trash is better than her best singin on a good day. Thank You."
1,DONALD DUCK?,"The first time I heard ""I Try"" on the radio I thought a new Disney album had been released and Donald Duck was singing a tune. It was quite amusing.Then I find out that it was someone seriously trying to sing! Seriously people, Macy Gray CANNOT sing! Her voice is horrible. Some people say that she is very talented?! What is she talented at? It's definitely not singing.So far this album is bombing on the Billboard charts compared to her first one. Let's hope people don't buy this album, she'll be a one hit wonder and then she will go away!"
2,after the Shock wore off,"the thing about Macy Gray is that to Me She isn't the worst thing in the Business far from it&in fact She is a Bit Different as a Artist for what goes for being nowadays but having said that, Her voice is still hard to Digest.Somewhere Between Mary J.Bliege,Rod Stewart,Eartha Kitt,&Tracy Chapman is Macy Gray&it isn't moving me except to crack up.Now the music has Funk Elements there but Her voice&Lyrics Never Rise to take it anywhere.Her concepts at times are interesting but that Voice Shoots it down as do Her Lyrics.also with some of Her Subject Matter&Lyrical Content you feel there is a Shock Value trying to Be Reflected but it wears off really soon&The Material never Recovers."
4,"Much improved over ""On How Life Is""...","I was initially disappointed by Macy Gray's debut release, ""On How Life Is"", due to its sparse number of tracks (only ten, no hidden tracks or anything) and the similarity of some (most notably ""I Try"" and ""Still""). It was still an awesome album, but I'll have to give top points to ""The Id"" as the current best Macy Gray album. Thirteen tracks, including the hidden track, ""Shed"", is more than enough. And the offerings are plentiful. ""Relating to a Psychopath"" is just as good, if not better, than her first album's opener ""Why Didn't You Call Me?"" Also excellent is ""Sexual Revolution"" with its slow intro and disco transition, ""Freak Like Me"" for its oldies-style melody and ""Sweet Baby"" just because it's the best! (Do you really need another reason?) And, despite other fans' hatred for it, I thought that the end track, ""Blowin' Up Your Speakers"" was awesome! Macy Gray truly struts her stuff on ""The Id""."
2,Are You Kidding Me?,"Second best CD of the year? Yes, Macy Gray has some songwriting skills, but in case you hadn't noticed, the womancan't sing.This alone makes any Macy Gray CD 3 stars at best. Not to mention the fact that the music on this CD is one big collage of cliches. She should take up writing poetry books or perhaps letting other artists perform her stuff, becausesongwriting is the ONLY skill that her music displays. Two stars is generous."
1,Price must be a typo!,"I was about to purchase these because they are so hard to find; but fortunately, it struck me that $60 is a lot to pay for paper towells. I googled and found Select-a-Size prints 12-pack for $16 (160 sheets) - That's half of the Amazon price.I love Amazon, but this price has to be an error."
5,like double the paper towels,"They're paper towels. The great thing is the select-a-size, which usually means I get about twice as much use out of a roll."
5,Loved this book,The book has a terrific plot and is very well written. I enjoyed seeing Venice through the author's eyes and appreciated the translation of the sporadic Italian phrases
3,It was just ok,"Found this a little boring, will not read the rest of the series. Disappointed, thought it would be more romantic"
5,A fantastic book,"Few books make me both misty-eyed and laugh out loud... This was one of them. Can't recommend it highly enough, even if you don't care to move to Venice in the near future."
3,Book Club selection,"This book was our August Book club selection. The club was split on liking it and hating it, it certainly gave a good discussion. Personally I liked it. Though I was just in venice a week before reading it, so perhaps I was biased. Marlena did acurately portray Venice as to the locations and sights in the book matching real life, but she left a lot of questions in peoples minds, such as she answered What and where a lot, but never a why, as in Why did she fall for peter sellers fernando? why did she move why were they leaving why why why.. though she is a cook, we did like her descriptions of things using food ajectives, but it needed to be mixed up a bit, we all got really tired of the term Blueberry eyes.. the recipes in the end are amazing.So I guess in summary, I'd reccomend A Thousand Days in Venice, if you have been, or ever plan to go there. otherwise, you might want to make a different selection.Eric"
3,A slow-moving romance,"I love books that detail the intricacies of a place and culture; In this regard, ""A Thousand Days in Venice"" does not disappoint. Marlena di Blasi paints as vivid a picture of Venice as anyone could hope for - when she walks through the market, you smell the cheese and taste the wine. My problem with this book is the romantic interest - Fernando, or the Stranger. He is romantic in his impulsiveness, his disregard for convention, but that's it. In every other way, he's just completely ordinary. It's no fun reading about someone who is so dull, who actually complains when his (chef) wife wants to cook a gourmet meal. The main characters are so incompatible, I became frustrated with the long drawn out passages about how di Blasi was going to make their relationship work. I could have read an entire book about her own experience in Venice (the places she saw, things she ate, people she met) without Fernando and been better off."
3,"Romantic, sensual tale.........","Venice immediately conjures up visions of romance and beauty, so with a wonderful backdrop this love story has a sensual headstart. This is the story of two unlikely people that fall in love in Venice and then through a series of events that are both funny and endearing, decide to spend their lives together. It is the tale of them learning about each other and in this process, they also learn about themselves. Venice is so delicately and intimately described that the author's love for this city is clear. The discussions of the meals and wines and the strolls through the shops paint a warm and vivid picture. When the author learns to adjust to the cultural differences of her new life in Venice and her life in the United States she learns much about herself, her lover and the people in general. This is a romantic adventure that is a delight to read."
4,A cookbook disguised as a romance,"I very much enjoyed this story of accidental romance, but by far the biggest benefit of owning this book has been the recipes in the back: we have cooked most of them and added each new dish to our list of favorites."
1,Boring,"Surely it's many women's dream to be attracting a stranger and marry off to a Venetian, but this is a really boring story. I tried to read it many times and just can't get into it, although I'm a big fan of Italy and Venice is one of my favorite cities. I enjoyed reading the ""Mediterranean Summer"" by David Shalleck much better."
5,A thousand days in venice review,"What a wonderful little novel! If you love Italy as I do, you will love this story as it leads you through the day to day life of this interesting and colorful heroine throughout the city of Venice. Diplaced, lonely, living in this city that couldnt be further away from Saint Louis, Missouri in every way, she builds a new life for herself. The story is full of cooking, eating and enjoying the food of Venice as well as the people who live there."
2,Overuse of words,"Her passion is evident, but it didn't need to be described in so many words. It was almost an overabuse of adjectives. It's fine to paint a picture, but it need not be the Sistine Chapel. The cover, which is spectacular, actually said it all."
2,1000 Days in Venice,"Very unlikely secenario. Confusing read. Is she a writer, is she a cook, does she write about cooking. Not clear. The stranger's character, not well developed. The unlikely romance is bizarre and storyline gets put aside for home decorating and cooking issues at times. I don't get it."
4,Venice-- great; love story -- incomprehensible!,"Just have to echo what others have said. On the whole I liked this; I read it on the plane to Venice, then skimmed through it again near the end of our stay. I loved her descriptions of Venice, food, culture clashes, getting the wedding dress made... but I could NOT understand the appeal of her husband, Fernando! He just sounds like a desperate, dorky, nerdy loser who throws himself at her just because he ""fell in love with her profile"" -- and he gets worse, not better, as the book progresses. I'm an impulsive romantic and tend to wear my heart on my sleeve, but I can't believe I'd be so reckless and dumb as to throw my life away on a guy I didn't even know. I'm amazed that their relationship has lasted even five years."
5,A book to savor...,"Most of my favorite books vividly evoke a place, and this one is no different. De Blasi shares her Venice, and her romance, in this delightful memoir. It's been well described, so I won't summarize it. It's a book that, like a good meal, must be experienced to be appreciated.Readers looking for a travelogue or cookbook may be disappointed, but that isn't de Blasi's fault-- she beautifully accomplishes what she sets out to do, which is to offer a glimpse of romance and beauty, and a look at a different world. The story of her romance isn't strange to me, as my own marriage began similarly nearly 25 years ago. It happens, but only, I think to those open to serendipity, and de Blasi certainly is.Although there will be prosaic naysayers who simply don't get it, this is a book I'l read many times. I highly recommend it for armchair travellers and those who believe in serendipity!"
1,Pretty Boring,I am a person who always reads a book to the end.... even if its bad. This is one I just can't seem to get through. I've read 3/4 of it and I just can't waste another minute on it. The author does describe Venice in great detail and the nice cafes etc. I kept waiting for this story to get interesting and it didn't. I kept waiting for the love story to blossom and it didn't. I don't understand why all the high marks for this book. I don't leave many reviews unless I really like a book or unless I really disliked a book. I just felt the reviews on this book are a bit misleading.
5,Great Read,"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. I do rate it a five. Besides, I got a few extra ideas for dinner. What more can anyone want? It's a book about love, and the changes one makes in their life for love. It has a beautiful ending. I liked this book so well that I purchased several of Marlena De Blasi's other books."
2,Eh.....its wasnt the worst book I have ever read.,"This books starts out ok....then it slows WAY down. The author jumps around alot. She will describe something happening in September then goes back to August, which I wouldnt mind if that were the tone of the book, I personally think it is just unorganized writing.It appears that the author refers to her husband as the strange (really --- you did marry him) when she is angry with him and as Fernando (his name) when she is not...its weird to me.Oh well, I did make it to the end but this short book took me weeks to power through it (I can normally read a book in days)...I kept waiting for the book to reach an interesting point or a turn of events, it just never did."
2,Overrated,"The author assumes we all have the ability to acquire a 4,000 bottle collection of wine, and at times looks down upon those of us who enjoy wine, but don't have the proper credentials to qualify as wine snobs. This book needs more practical support for those people who want to collect a variety of good value wines, and store them over time. This book does not deliver on that point."
2,Keep searching,"In my opinion this book is really more about wine collecting then it is wine cellars. There is some decent info about building and keeping a wine cellar but the most of the pertinent information on that subject in this book could have ended on chapter 3 possibly 4 if you're interested in cataloging your wine. The bulk of this book is made up the author's personal antidotes that might give some insight into wine cellaring but can be difficult to trudge through while he uses terms like ""grocery store wine"", blasts the wine critic in the Wall Street Journal for recommending cheap wine (gasp!), or tells the story of how his dad first started cellaring wine using the closet in the maids room in the back of his house ""leaving just enough space for the poor woman to hang a single with dress uniform on a single wire hanger"". If you need a 152 page book that has 70 pages on the core components of building a wine cellar shouted down to you from a very high horse... this is the book for you."
2,Practical but off-putting,"Beyond the valuable practical advice offered in this book, particularly in using Excel to organize a wine collection, and helpful delineation of wine collector ""types"", I was put off by the obvious focus on über expensive wines and the sexist nature of many of the comments and stories."
3,Cadfael's pictures,"This is most useful as a guide to Elis Peters' novels. The index of plants is oriented toward the fictional Cadfael and his uses, rather than to mediaval practice.The pictures are coffee table book quality.A must for gardeners who are Brother Cadfael fans, or Cadfael fans who are gardeners, but not a serious work."
5,It is a wonderful and informitive book on herbs.,This book was very informitive on the uses of herbs for medicines in the Middle Ages. I happen to be a fan of Cadfael and thought the pictures were wonderful. I had been doing a project on medical herbs in the Middle Ages and it was my best resource.
5,A Treasure of Medieval Herb Lore,"Brother Cadfael's Herb Garden: An Illustrated Companion to Medieval Plants and Their UsesDon't be put off by negative reviews; in addition to being a gorgeous picture book, this volume is also a treasure trove of useful information on the medicinal and culinary uses of herbs. A wonderful introduction gives a history of herbs and gardens of the twelfth century, then the chapters go into detail about monastic gardens, Brother Cadfael's herbal kingdom and the superb A to Z index of the known herbs of the period.Interspersed with the text are gorgeous photos of Wales, herbs, methods of storing them and much more. Also in sidebars we get a glimpse of related herbal lore straight from the pages of Ellis Peters' wonderful Cadfael Chronicles. What could be more wonderful for the Medievalist or Cadfael afficionado?Highly recommended."
5,Delightful,This book is a joy-containing not only the facts about the Medieval herbs and plants-but also charming references to the amazing character of Cadfael.Don't be put off by negative comments-this book's a gem.
1,Misleading Title,"I believe that this book is much more of a picture book than anything else. Within the text, it describes Brother Cadfeal more than it does his gardens or how he planned them or used them. This book is nicely done but it is not worth the price if you are looking for a comprehensive reference for how to grow and use herbs. Please look somewhere else. There are many out there which hold better information."
5,Beautiful monastic garden,"Was there ever another like Brother Cadfael? This absolutely gorgeous book shows the Shrewsbury Quest medieval herb garden Cadfael worked in. Alas, the town of Shrewsbury couldn't pull together enough to preserve this lovely place and it's closed to the public now. But the book has not only the glowing photographs but also a great deal of information on monastic medieval gardens. Well worth your while if you are at all interested in medieval or monastic gardens or Cadfael or the Marches, or herbs of any kind. Highly recommended. This is my second copy -- now I have one to keep close (chained to my library, if I carry the medieval theme out) and the other to lend."
1,False Advertising,"I ordered this boxed set as well as the Spring Bouquet boxed set of handkerchiefs. Although they appear to be two different sets, in actuality they are the same. Had that been clear in the listing, I would not have ordered as I did."
3,Made in China?,"One of the key buying decisions for this product was that I was lead to believe it was Made in USA. After receiving this, I was very disappointed to see it was in fact Made in China. Should have bought the Peerless (which I think is still made in USA). I haven't even unboxed this yet, so to be fair, I can't comment on build quality or anything else."
5,Rock Solid Wall Mount,"This wall mount is distinguished from other products in the market, the back plate can be easily expanded to 3 studs wide, while the other products usually cover 2 studs. The only alternative I found is from Peerless but this one looks stronger."
2,"This product does not work with Sharp Aquous 65"" for which it is recommended","I bought this wall mount along with the Sharp 65"" Aquos LCD TV because Amazon recommended it. Turns out the the bolts in the wall mount kit do not fit the available holes in the back of the Sharp TV and I have to order an M10 kit from Sanus to adapt this wall mount for the Sharp TV.Delays, irritation, aggravation. Now I have to wait 3 days for the M10 kit to arrive and pay another $30 for it."
3,It works,The system was installed by professional installer and he was happy with it. Only issue is that is does not come with the brackets and bolts that are needed for a Sharp LC65D64U...they have to be ordered separately. Amazon should make sure to have that on its recommended products list when ordering a Sharp TV
3,Bolts won't fit the Sharp 65 in HDLCD,It's a great product but you will have to go to the hardware store and buy 3/8 bolts to fit the 65 in Sharp HDLCD TV.david
2,Does not work in all configurations,"I purchased this mount because I was installing my Sony 52"" Bravia 52V5100 on a wall that had 3 studs to attach to - 1 being in the center. This mount advertised it would accommodate a 3 stud installation ... which is true, except they fail to mention that expanded in the 3 stud configuration, it won't accept mounting of some TVs.According to Sanus, my TV has a 12"" mounting pattern on the back which is too narrow for the mount when it is expanded. Their solution was to offer to sell me expansion brackets and even charge me shipping on them!If you decide to use this mount expanded, make sure that your TV still will mount to it!Oh, on top of that, the bolts and screws are metric... if you need to pick up longer lag screws (in my case) it will be impossible to find longer ones at your local Home Depot!"
3,Flat Panel Wall mount,"Average wall mount but I do not see how it can be listed to support upto a 84"" TV when it can only be extended to 42"". I purchased this product for my 65"" plasma, but found out it could not extend far enough to catch the spacing of the brackets on the back of the TV. Otherwise, its a standard wall mount with tilt."
4,"couldn't ask for much more but then, I guess I could","Easy to follow instructions and incredibly sturdy. My only complaint would be that my TV must have been in the 2% range in that I was not able to hit three studs AND keep the TV centered on my wall. I'm about 2"" off to the right which 98% of the population won't even notice but I have to nag about something. Oh yea, it's really heavy too (see ""incredibly sturdy"" comment above) so I did need an extra set of hands when bolting it to the wall. I will say this, if you've never hung more than a collage of 4 x 6 prints of your kids on the wall, hire someone to hang your TV. There are plenty of home theater installers out there that you can hire to do this and most will have some nice tricks to hide all the wires that still need to be run to the TV. If you've bought a nice big plasma or LCD, spend the extra money and get it installed correctly. You'll be much happier."
2,"No support for Sharp Aquos 65"" LCD","Come on guys, would it kill you to add the 4 m10-5-30mm $0.80 bolts to the package and make the slots on the brakers wide enought to take the 10mm bolt? After all, it is the only 65"" lcd on the market, so it sounds like a great idea to support it, but groteskly overlooked by some rookie engineers!?With regards to the bolts, Home Depot has them, but the other user who left a review on the bolts left some importan information out (cost me 3 trips to the store), there are 3 types of M10 sizes, M10-1 M10-5 and M10-25. The right size is M10-5-30mm. You will have to file the slots on each of the 4 corners in order to fit the new bolts. This is a bit tedious and it takes about 30 mins to complete."
4,Heavy gauge steel,Installed easily and appears to be more than adequate to hold my 50 inch LG plasma. I like the tilting feature.
4,Great deal,"After much researching, we finally decided purchasing this product from Amazon at a much cheaper price compared to competitors. We received the product quicker than we anticipated. Quick, simple installation. Make sure you have an extra pair of hands to mount the TV to the wall bracket. I love the fact you can adjust and angle your TV with ease once mounted..so far so good."
4,well made,this is a great wall mount but to get three studs it's a little wide for the mounts on my Sharp lcd. that's more the tv's fault than the mount though.
4,Works Great for a 65in Plasma,Easy to install. Bolted to 3 studs 16 inches appart. Very secure and sturdy. It is designed to support larger TVs so there were a lot of left over parts.
5,Extremely Strong,"Just hung up my 60 inch plasma using this mount. I love that it can span to 3 studs. That is what sold me on it. It only took about an hour to set this up. The instructions are fairly easy to follow. One other thing is there are bracket extensions for the TV if needed. It would be almost impossible for this mount not to fit on the back of your TV. If you are going to hang a TV over maybe 75 pounds, I would definitely get this mount."
4,Sturdy and expensive,"This is a very sturdy item, and I have no fears about wall mounting my tv on it. The reasons I chose this over the Chief mount of the same size are (1) this Sanus includes hardware to hang the TV both as a slim profile mount, or a tilting mount. I used the tilt mount, mainly because I don't think my plugs would fit behind the slim mount); and (2) on some configurations, you can put this into 3 studs, not just two.This product is expensive, though, and if you compare the wall mounts on monoprice, they are 80% less. The reason I went with the more expensive mount is that I didn't want my TV to fall, and what is a couple hundred dollars compared to that? Anyway, it would be interesting to know if this mount is really worth that much more than a cheaper one, and I honestly find myself doubting it. I wonder if Consumer Reports would deign to review such products as these?"
5,Another good review,"I just wanted to drop a note that I received this for Christmas. I got it installed yesterday and I have to say that the only thing I needed that wasn't in the box (besides the screwderiver/drill) is the second person to help lift the TV. I mounted my 58"" Samsung plasma that weighs approxiamtely 85lbs and I was always hesitant until I mounted this heavy duty wall plate onto the wall. I only mounted it to 2 wood studs and I could do pull-ups on the wall plate.I would have no problems reccomending both the construction quality or the appearance of this product. I would say that you should always measure twice and cut once. I can't really see how this mount would fail if installed properly. It tilts very easily, comes with the low-profile option as well. It also comes with everything neccessary to install it into concrete/brick too. All-in-all, I am very happy with this product."
4,almost perfect!,Great product. Lots of hardware as others have noted but did have slight problem with fitting screws and ended up having to shorten them ONLY because we did not think to look at hardware that CAME with the Samsung for hanging it! Found that after it was up. Great value.
4,Very sturdy wall mount,"This wall mount is heavy, and it is very sturdy. After I got it on the wall, I had no doubt the TV would be there until I took it down. The tilt feature works like a charm. The instructions could have been a little more clear, and the main problem I encountered was incorrect hardware. I probably had at least 20 bolts left over for different TV installations, but the ones for my TV were not in there. I trip to Home Depot solved this, but you have to be careful you are getting the right size, length, and thread count."
4,Positive,This product was very easy to install. We had it on the wall with our tv on it in about 1 hour.It received in very good shape and within the time frame given to be received.Thank youDL
1,Piece of junk !,Bought this bat house because of the description. It seemed correctly priced. For what was offered. It was delivered in a timely manner. However it was stapled together with split wood and was not sealed in as much as it would allow light in and bats do not like light. I returned it the following day. Don'waste your time.Dave
3,Not thrilled,"Not very thrilled about this grill. Was easy to put together, but the burner knobs don't work very well. The one to the far right won't shut off. At one point, flames were going every where when I started the grill. Not sure what I'm going to do about it yet, it's not very safe. Other than that it seems fine."
4,excellent grill,"I've had the grill for a couple of years now and we're really pleased with the performance. Everything has worked very well except for the side burner which only heats at full throttle...it won't turn down...it's something that I need to fix and my be a result of my assembly for all I know. We also use a Weber Silver and I much prefer to use the Ducane - it heats up MUCH faster and cooks better at high temp. I get the ducane upto 500 (to sear steaks, etc) in about 7 minutes whereas the (more expensive) Weber Silver might take 15 minutes to achieve that heat.The steel (porcelain coated) heat plates haven't held up very well, though and will have to be replaced soon. The Weber on the other hand, still has good plates in it after about 5 years...so there is one result of the price difference."
5,Excellent Play Kitchen!,This Kitchen was bought for my two nices that are ages 2 and 3. They had a blast with this kichen! It was the hit of Christmas morning! Their other 5 brothers sisters even had fun playing with it! I highly recommend it!
4,Dream Kitchen Cooks,"This product took about 30 minutes of time to assemble and the cardboard backer did not line up with the pre-made holes. The kids were so excited, they were playing with it while we built it. The 5 yr old seemed more interested than the 2 yr old. It has a lot of interaction for the kids and many accessory pieces included. It took a beating and should hold up well to years of play."
4,My 2 year daughter loves to play with this,Pros:It is a nice kitchen set. Little pricey but nice.Cons:1. Need a lot of time to assemble.2. Needs 8-9 batteries.
3,No storage = big mess!,"My 3 year old son loves this kitchen, and has since he got it at about 18 months. And it always gets a lot of use when any friends come over.My biggest complaint is that all of the drawers and cabinets are very small and so it doesn't really have enough space to store all of his kitchen appliances. (The drawers are even smaller than their face plates so they don't fit much of anything!) As a result it is always very messy, which makes him less inclined to use it. The microwave is also small so his cups from a different playset don't fit in it. Our friends have a Kidcraft kitchen that has a much bigger refrigerator where they can store all the toys when not in use.I'm also not a big fan of the noise from all the buttons - when we first got it he would just push the buttons to hear the noises and I felt it distracted him from creative play."
5,Kitchen Review,My husband and I purchased this kitchen for our two year old twin boys.They love this kitchen. It is played with almost all day.It took us less than an hour to put together and seems to be very sturdy.
4,Mother of 2,"My in-laws had bought this kitchen for my daughter who was 18 month old Christmas 2003. My daughter still loves it and has tons of tea parties. My younger daughter who will be 2 loves playing with the kitchen also. So much so we are buying her, her own kitchen. The batteries on the light above the sink runs out to fast. And it is a little disappointing that the sink does not make running water sounds. My daughter actually puts one of the pots on the burner to make the running water sound. One of our neighbors has a 9 year old that sometimes comes over and she enjoys playing with the kitchen also. It is also very sturdy. We just purchased the kitchen with the washer and dryer for my other daughter and I hope they love that as much as they love this kitchen and I hope it holds up as well."
4,Play kitchen,"My daughter LOVES this kitchen! She got it months ago for christmas and plays with it constantly. It wasn't too much of a pain to put together but there is one flaw that I feel is worth mentioning. The two compartments that house the batteries for the sound functions are a bit of a pain to put on and off and the connectors that hold them are very brittle. So the combination of the two ended in breaking some clips. I think they could have designed this a little smarter considering the rest of the is so well built. Also our sticker set that we got was printed incorrectly, we got a new one pretty fast though from step 2."
4,Kids love the Kitchen sets!,"Any parent cannot go wrong with this kitchen set, it is a blast for kids and the sturdy construction and thick plastic will ensure it lasts a long time. My daughter will constantly pretend to make food and all of her friends think it is fun as well. The only problem with it is the storage for fake food items is limited and you will soon find that there is no where to go with it all, so its a good idea to have a storage place for extras because it seems unavoidable as your fake food collection grows over time. The electronic phone, microwave, oven, and cook top bring some sense of action to the set. Be careful when putting this together that the screws dont come through the back side or front side of the kitchen set, because there are no pilot holes so you have to use your judgement on screw locations."
4,My kids love it!,"We bought this kitchen for our 20 month year old daughter for Christmas. I did my research before I bought it and I am very happy I chose this kitchen. Not only does our daughter love it but our 4 yr old son does also. It does take a lot of batteries but, the sounds are so realistic. My husband got a 24 hour virus on Christmas Eve. I had to put the kitchen together alone. It was not that hard. It took about 1 1/2 hours. Make sure you use a power drill and it is charged. Our drill wasn't charged enough. You have to screw in about 50 screws. My hands were hurting when I was finished. The only bad thing about the kitchen was the stickers. I don't know what was wrong with mine. As I peeled each sticker, only the picture would come off. The sticky part wouldn't. I couldn't put all the stickers on the kitchen. At first I was mad but, then I thought, I'm sure my kids will eventually try to peel the stickers off."
5,Love this Kitchen!,"We bought this kitchen for our 2 1/2 year old son for Christmas. He LOVES it! The microwave, oven, phone, burner and light all turn on and make noises (exept light). It's great! It has a lot of doors and places for the kids to put things in (which my son loves). It does require 12 batteries and since Christmas I have already replaced the batteries in the burner but that could have been becuase I had bad batts. It doesn't matter anyway, it's great all around! I also love the fact that it's not girly colors, and seems to be very durable. As far as the assembly goes, my husband had no problems and he was doing it while watching football! Follow the directions and take your time (it is not a quick put together). I hope your children(s) love it as much as mine!"
5,Grandchildren love it.,"Grandchildren ages 2 and 3 1/2 love this set. It is smaller and less bulky than others, but has all ""appliances"" needed for their play."
4,"Nothing special, but good toy","I bought this for my twin daughters for Christmas and they love it. They were getting to the point where they were pretending to serve me food so a kitchen toy was the next logical step.The kitchen itself looked a little small out of the box, but as soon as the girls started to play with it, it seemed to be appropriately sized.I'm honestly confused with other reviewers saying it took hours to build and had confusing instructions. It took a friend and I less than an hour to build, that includes placing all the decals."
4,Great little kitchen - be prepared for a nightmare when you assemble,"The kitchen itself is great. After researching kitchen sets for weeks, we picked this one and are happy with our choice. That's not the bad part. My husband, who was once a foreman on a steel crew, usually can assemble anything you can imagine with relative ease and efficiency. That said, he had a HELL of a time putting this kitchen together. It took about two hours, whereas if the instructions had been written properly it should take 1/3 of that time. He says he has never seen a set of instructions so poorly designed. Be prepared to tear your hair out when it comes time to assemble this thing."
4,great toy kitchen,"I opted for a plastic kitchen set because we are moving in two years. The reviews on this one are great and I have seen it in person at various homes.After reading the reviews I thought it would have been harder to put together by myself. But I was able to complete it in 95 minutes, with a quick break to get more batteries and a more precise phillips head screw driver. As noted by the others, take your time, read the direction and it will come together. There were a few areas where the screw hole was not put through the plastic so I had to do it as I went.My hands are a little tired from the longer screws, but it is all together and looks great.My only annoyance is the drawers not being very big and they fall out if you pull them out too far. But I knew that was an issue from seeing the kitchen in person. The stove burner doesn't lay flat. I reinstalled it twice just to make sure it was in properly. It appears to be...I can't wait for my son to see it on Christmas morning!"
5,"Great kitchen, but.....","My 2yr old daughter loves this kitchen. I think it is so neat even though it could use a few more sounds. My only problem with this kitchen is the dish rack, does it work for everyone else? The dishes on ours keep falling off and it's really frustrating so I finally gave up trying, so it just sits there unused. It would be nice if we could use it since we paid good money for it.But aside from that LITTLE problem everything else is great. It gets alot of 'ooohs' and 'ahhs' from our nieces when they come over to play."
5,Truly a Dream - Step 2 listens!,"My 20 month old daughter cannot get enough of this toy. She plays with this everyday, making us muffins and macaroni, and even warms up her milk in her own microwave. She loves the light that she can turn on herself, as well as the boiling and frying sounds that she can make while cooking. I think that one of the things that really sets this apart is the attention to detail on this kitchen. Everything makes the right sounds, but nothing is too obnoxios.About the assembly, it does seem odd that the holes aren't there for the backsplash. However, you don't need a drill to make it work. Although it's not easy, the screws will go into the plastic all by themselves without drilling a hole first. Other than that, there were no problems with the assembly and it was a fun toy to put together. We have not experienced the problems of the doors staying closed. It also seems like the problem with the dish rack has been fixed."
3,Education can be funner,"We have several of the Reader Rabbit programs so buying this one seemed like a good idea. I would give it the ""ok"" my 5 year old will play the game but it is not his first choice. The fact that you have to do things in a certain sequence is boring to him because it is always the same. Slow moving game.(It might be just us!)There are a couple of cute places like reading the word and dressing a hamster and bubble blowing dragons. But overall I wish we would have waited on this one."
1,Tells kids wrong sounds for some letters! Many mistakes!,"I liked the design of the program. I played briefly with my daughter and then started letting her play alone. Today I played with her and was surprized to see it telling her incorrect sounds for some letters! ""Click on the letter to hear its sound."" She clicked on E and it made the sound for A! The same thing happened with O and I in this section of the game. My husband said he saw it giving her incorrect info in another area of the game. Now she's sad that I took her game away and I can't get a refund because I lost my receipt and the toy store won't take opened software. Apparently, there was poor quality control on this program. This could really confuse a young child learning phonics! Or perhaps the creators of this game could use some basic phonics lessons?Note added 2/15/12: Please note that I wrote this review in February of 2003. I am told by another Amazon customer that the current program is free of errors."
1,Doesn't Work on Latest Mac OS,"We owned Reader Rabbit products for years, and my children loved them. This version does not work on the latest OS. Email from their technical support indicates that the software is ""very old,"" and therefore doesn't run properly."
4,Well thought out,"We graduated our 4 year old up to this program. Unlike some of the other reviewers, we didnt have any issues with the installation (on XP Professional SP2).The graphics are not quite as slick as some of the other Reader Rabbit programs (like Reader Rabbit Preschool, etc).The pace is very good, and the program repeats basic sounds, so this follows the 'phonics' method. A group of chipmunks teach the sounds and reading skills, and they have kept my 4 year old engaged, and she has made great progress.A 2nd CD comes with this that gives you some printable games, a collection of the Reader Rabbit sounds, and some sample-training games."
2,Rolie-Polie,"Combine an unhappy psychologist, a rolie-polie police investigator, urban runaways, wealthy dysfunctional siblings, robot acting students, a festering home boy, fazed girlfriends, a chambermaid ex, pocketbook lawyers, a vexatious psychologist, murders, decapitation, programmed sex, taxidermy, money tree, Los Angeles and a few other disconnected deprecations and you have a pestiferous horizontal story, which looses the readers interest.I'm the author of the psychological drama KISSING FREUD, the action adventure DUBROVNIK, and the newly published IT'S ALL MAKE BELIEVE, ISN'T IT? *Marilyn Monroe Returns*. You can preview and purchase my books here on amazon.com or my secure site at [...]"
5,Gone,"This book is excellant!! as to be expected from Jonathon Kellerman, full of suspence and keeps u guessing right to the end"
2,I don't know.,"I hate to give a J K a low rate review. Since he is like like my best page turner writer,13 novels i think i read.So i am not goin to elaborate, it's still a good book, but not like past ones.for a newbiew Kellerman, do read it. IT's still boiling."
1,Gone,"I am tired of John Kellerman's books. It was very disapointing to me as was his other books. I keep trying to see if he would change his style. This is it, no more for me. I wish him well."
2,Easy to put down,"An OK read, but rather slow tedious until about three quarters of the way through and then a bit over the top. Still catching up on several in the Alex Delaware series that I haven't read yet; hope the next one is better."
2,Plodding,"It seemed to take forever to get through this one. The theories that get thrown back and forth between Milo and Alex take up way too much space in this book. The ending was ok, but that's the only reason I gave it two stars."
4,"Great Audio book, maybe not so good a read...","I listened to this book in the car on audio CD and really enjoyed it but I can see how it might be difficult even boring to read. I could just tune out of the boring bits..but readers have to actually read them.Anyway, I am a little confused about the Dowd family tree (probably because I wasn't paying close attention). If Nora and Billy had the same mother and Brad was abandoned by his mother who was her sister, how come they weren't related? My understanding is that the cop lady's father, Reynold's father, Brad's mom and Nora/Billy's mom were all siblings, which would make them all 1st cousins. But the book kept saying Brad, Cop Lady and Reynold Petey were cousins but Nora/Billy weren't.Can someone help me out as I don't want to listen to the book all over again...Apart from that, the book was OKAY. I personally prefer Faye Kellerman and only read Jonathan when there's no Faye available."
3,Predictable yet fun,"Despite having never read an Alex Delaware novel, Kellerman's lead player, I didn't feel lost or a lack of character development. The detectives are hard-boiled but show a relieving amount of sympathy once the bad guys are caught. While some may find the outfits of the characters a repetitious sort of description, I was actually impressed at the man's eye for detail in clothing for both men and women, and it helped to picture the people better.The clues he dropped were glaringly obvious of tell-tale horror to come, yet I still was kept gripped to the ending with the fast-paced action and several interesting side plots.[...]"
3,Less than riveting,"A pair of young, would-be movie stars, Michaela and Dylan, stage a publicity stunt, hoping to garner attention and film offers. Both attend the drama school run by a wealthy, eccentric older woman who never made it as an actor herself. Psychologist Alex Delaware is hired to evaluate Michaela in preparation for her trial for wasting police resources. When, weeks later, Michaela is murdered, Alex assists the cops with the investigation. The school, it seems, is a very dangerous place to enroll.As a thriller, Gone simply never takes off. The investigation is a plodding, rather dull one, and the upshot of the case is less than surprising. Alex's clinical skills are way underutilized. This novel's OK, but if you're looking for better, better look elsewhere."
1,Plodded Through...,"This is the second book by Jonathan Kellerman I've read, ""Billy Straight"" being the first. I really enjoyed that one and anticipated a good read with ""Gone"". Wrong! This book was extremely tedious, from start to finish. I kept at it longer than I should have, to the point I just started skimming through the details to just find out who did it..so that I could give them book away to some unsuspecting victim."
3,Reviews by Nan Kilar-This one is so-so,"Two wannabe actors stage their abduction, get caught, and a few days later the young woman is dead. As homicide detective Milo Sturgis and Alex Delaware try to figure out whodunit, I had a pretty good idea who was responsible as the bodies kept turning up. And talk about a wacko family that's introduced! The story is not exciting; it just plods along and should have ended with the killer's death. But there is a happy note in Alex's life.Hopefully the author will put some life into his next Alex Delaware story...if there is another one. They just aren't quite as exciting as they used to be."
2,Blah,"This was just so so. It took me several days to get thru it, hoping each time I picked it up it would get better, but it didn't. Maybe this was just not one of his best."
2,dissappointed,little bit dissappointed with the last couple of the Delaware series. not nearly as strong as they used to be.
4,Jonathan Kellerman is always good,"I bought 3 of Jonathan Kellerman's paperback novels a few months ago. I've read 2 of them so far, and I still have the 3rd one. I don't remember which is which. If I read this one already, it was good. If I didn't, I ""know"" it'll be good, because all his books are good. (His wife Faye is too gory for my taste, but Jonathan is OK.)"
2,"Going, going, gone","I agree with a previous reviewer here. It seems as though the formula for Kellerman's novels is becoming predictable and stale.I can almost tell you the exact steps the book will take you on from beginning to end. It doesn't matter who was killed or why, it's the same formula.But is it hard to read? No. Gone is easy to read but if you've read the books before this one this will seem familiar."
3,Middle of the road murder mystery,"Other than Alex being a shrink, there wasn't much psychological about this not-quite thriller. The much more interesting storyline, dealing with the vengeful Dr. Hauser was eons more interesting than the creepy sibling story in the foreground.Well paced and smooth flowing, save for tedious descriptions of rooms and what people were wearing, the not-as-interesting-as-it-could-be story was the only thing keeping this from being a better read."
1,Something to do.....at best,"I have read a lot of books and to be honest I haven't really found a reason to rate a book and give a review, until now. This book has to be the most linear book I have ever read. By that I mean that there is no ups, downs, or twists to this book. I wouldn't suggest it to anyone unless you are very bored."
3,Not his best,"I usually devour Kellerman's books, he is one of the better writers of this decade. But this book dragged somewhat. It wasn't a bad book, just a little too long, and the end seemed to go on forever. I wasn't too fond of Robin - she was pretty dull - therefore, I had high hopes for Allison and am sorry that he brought Robin back. Maybe he will develop her character more..........."
2,Lacks plot,"As in other Kellerman novels, the plot is loose and unconvincing.If all the pieces come together at the end, it is because of the same old ""deus ex machina"" Kellerman uses in other novels, not because of the natural, deductive progression one would expect from a police mystery work.The author uses his signature resources: detailed physical descriptions of characters and their clothes, infinite Californian car drives, discussions about the case over meals, impersonal Los Angeles atmosphere. However, without real plot depth to sustain, these scenes seem repetitive and unjustified.The action is slow and the outcome is predictable and anticlimactic.The rendition by actor John Rubinstein is excellent, especially his versatility in switching between the characters' voice registers and timbres."
1,Gone for good,"Boring is the only word to describe Kellerman's latest. I rarely put a book down before finishing...kept hoping it would get better, but it didn't happen. Finally gave up about halfway through."
3,Another great Kellerman mystery,"Gone by Jonathan Kellerman is a great fast paced mystery thriller. In this one Kellerman tells us what kind of things can happen to naive young people who go to Hollywood hoping to become stars. It's an old shtick, but Kellerman makes it feel fresh and new. As in most of his books, we learn of yet another group of people that are vulnerable to exploitation because they are somewhat invisible to the rest of us. (I'm not talking about Hollywood wannabes here). The great thing about Kellerman's stories is right from the beginning you think you know where it's going, and you're always wrong. Kellerman's villains are all different and motivated, each one brings a new meaning to Evil."
4,Enjoyed It...,"Unlike many reviewers here, I enjoyed the book. Maybe it's because I am a new Jonathan Kellerman reader, and not having read all of his previous Alex Delaware novels (I've only read Obsession), I don't find them repetitive or disappointing. This one is about Hollywood, and the dream that brings so many into the Hollywood scene, the idea of being a star. A young couple creates a hoax where they have been carjacked and held against their will for attention. Soon, one of them is found murdered and the other is missing, and the body count soon rises.By not reading them in order, I have missed out on the relationships between Allison and Alex and Robin and Alex, which are also in this book. I do look forward to reading more of the series."
4,"Suspense....no, but still a good read","It is hard to believe that this is the 20th Alex Delaware novel. I haven't read them all, but instead have picked some of the better titles to read...Rage, Monster and Time Bomb. I'm sure everyone has their own list of Kellerman favorites.In Gone, two aspiring actors, Dylan Meserve and Michaela Brand, fake their abduction and torture. After they are found out, Michaela is brutally murdered and the case is turned over to Milo Sturgis. The case eventually leads to an acting school run by an interesting character named Nora Dowd. Ultimately more people are killed and the mystery broadens. I was surprised at how fast I was drawn into the story.One of Kellerman's strengths in my opinion is his ability to build good stories with interesting characters. In Gone, Kellerman is at his bet in this regard.While some of his other stories have been more suspenseful, Gone will keep you reading.A good book for a dull weekend."
2,Gone,"I read all Jonathan Kellerman books, but this one put me to sleep. I was disappointed. I also think he should resolve this love interest and get Robin back. Allison needs to go. His books were better with Robin. These issues get boring after awhile."
1,Disappointing... !,"Bill Cosby's sense of humour makes you laugh in places but as one of the readers said earlier ""this book has no sense of direction"". So, after reading it the question ""now what?"" still remains unanswered. And quite honestly you don't even get a hint to guess what the answer is...Mr. Cosby is an undoubtedly clever man but maybe in this particular piece of work he gives us an insight into what he was like during his university years?The book is fun but very disappointing in sense that this isn't what you'd expect from the title. Maybe he should've called it: ""You're at university. Now what? Depends on you..."""
1,pessimistic awful book,"This book has nothing positive and uplifting to tell college graduates. Rather it depresses them. I read it as I will graduate in January and Cosby seems to think you don't learn anything in college. He also seems to assume all students are stupid and incapable of even simple things. He also puts down liberal arts colleges. I would not read this if you want to be inspired after you finish college, only if you want to be depressed."
2,Negative outlook for graduates,"This was a tremendous disappointment. The book is awful. Mr. Cosby is very negative and there is little humor here. We gave the book to our college graduate as a gift and she hated it, so I read it and subsequently apologized to her. Don't waste your money or your time on this book."
2,How about the kids?,"This book seems to take the parents' perspective, not the student who is getting ready to be out on his own. It's not overly helpful but a book that would be great for college grads serious about starting out right isWelcome to the Real World: You Got an Education, Now Get a Life!, Revised and Updated Edition. If the seriousness of Welcome to the Real World is too much for you and you'd like to start out with something helpful but light hearted, then you should check out 50 Ways to Leave Your Mother, a funny, easy to read guide to living on your own, whether you are a college student or just a kid who's ready to leave home but not quite into studying up on how to do it. Both of these books though, take the kids' point a view, while the Cosby book sounds more like it's parent-directed. Mr. Cosby is a very funny man, but this is not one of his best efforts."
3,"Wrong Audience, Wrong Tone","The most booked commencement speaker seems to be out of place in this book for college graduates. Rather than giving humorous advice to graduates, he takes the role of a disgruntled parent. While I will not argue with his assessment that the college curriculum has been ""dumbed down"", Cosby seems to be suggesting that college lacks any purpose. As a consequence of this, graduates are not prepared for anything in the real world. This problem does not even address the greatest contradiction of this book. If this is a book for graduates, why is Cosby's voice that of an angry parent telling his children to get out of the house.There are many better books in this mold. I have liked Cosby's other books and I am in disbelief that he wrote this book. The book is neither humorous, not does the book speak to its intended audience. In reality, the book is just as misguided as the college students that the book allegedly targets."
2,An angry book from cosby?,"As Bill Cosby is one of my favorite authors and storytellers I was quite excited to read this book. Having completed this read I must admit to a real sense of disappointment; while the book tries to come across as tongue in cheek it reads more as a rant against higher education.In fact, it is a clean alternative to George Carlin's rantings which seem also to have gone from biting and funny to just biting.The entire book basically rants that your diploma is worthless and a slings out a ""might as well give up now"" attitude. The more I read, the more I kept waiting for Cosby to yell ""Just Kidding!"" but it never happened. No, it seems that we are getting a glimpse of the anger building up in him back in 1999 which has been driving his lectures of late.While the book is funny in a dark sort of way I cannot recommend it as a gift for any new graduate as it would probably not deliver on your expectations."
5,This book is so true,"Bill Cosby does it again. Being a recent College grad, I found this book very amusing and enjoyable to read. He hits the nail on the head in talking about apartments, job interviews, and leaving home.Final Word: A DEFINITE buy for any graduate!"
1,A Big Disapointment!,"I have two sons in college at the present time. I read this thinking it would make a great present and I was sadly mistaken. His other books added humor and insight - this one added neither insight or humor. I will not be buying it for my sons, who are headed in the right direction towards a career in their chosen fields of study."
3,Good CD not great,These guys had a lot of potential. They have some great riffs but just could never really put it all together. The vocalist gets annoying after a while. I think if these guys had a good singer that wrote good lyrics and knew how to make catchy verses this band could honestly be a huge force in the metal world. But the lack of good lyrics and average song writing will keep them as unknown
4,cute story,Jen and Sarah are sisters. Jen wants to have a room like her older sister Sarah's. Jen's family thinks that she's too young to care for nice things like dollhouses and wallpaper. One day Jen sneaks into Sarah's room and plays very nicely. Her mother and realize that she is growing up and can take care of nice things. They decide to redo Jen's room!The book was short but I did like it because it was fun and full of imaganation.It's great for children of all ages. Especially girls who have sisters. They will be able to relate to the characters in the book.
4,Fine with me,"Worth it if you need to control grind setting for different brewing methods (I use it for regular filter and espresso). Unlike one of the other reviewer's mine behaves correctly at different fineness settings.The mess? Big deal, use a towel."
3,"It's ok, a little messy but nothing seemd better","It works well, looks good, is not that big and does a credible job. Not too noisy. Cons are that dial is calibrated in seconds 20, 25 etc., so it is hard to remember and equate how much per cup. Seal between output hole and plastic cup is not that great, so there is always some grounds that spill out on the base of the unit and on the counter for each use. It also stupidly has a black cords though it is white. I guess I'd give it a 3 1/2 if I could.No other brands that were reviewed seemed better at a moderate price."
1,Too fine,My usual method for coffee is a french press. The coarse setting isn't course enough to use in a french press. The coarse setting grinds the beans finer than what you will get from a coffee shop for a drip maker. This makes for a very cloudy cup of coffee. I have gotten a better grind using my old blade grinder.
3,"Usable, but not great!","Pluses: Very compact with small counter-top footprint. Fairly quiet. Minuses: Unfortunately, it grinds all beans to the same texture despite whatever setting. Being mostly plastic, it creates a great deal of static electricity which makes transferring the ground coffee from the mill to the coffee maker basket a truly messy job best done in or near the sink. On-off rotary switch is calibrated in seconds which is less convenient than quantities. I am still looking for the ""perfect"" coffee mill. Given a second chance and knowing what I now know, I would not buy this product."
2,Does not do well on espresso grinds,"I just got one of these babies, and it works great for drip coffee. However, it is NOT useable for espresso grinds. As far as I can tell changing the grind setting has no effect whatsoever."
3,OK Grind but Messy Messy Messy ...,"The chute leading from the grinding wheel gets clogged, and grinds go all over the counter when you detach the ground coffee compartment from the unit. The consistency of the ground coffee is good however."
3,"Does a great job, but what a mess!","I've had this coffee mill for about 4 years, and it does a great job grinding coffee, but it also spews powdery coffee residue with abandon. I could live with this, but recently the lid of the cup that catches the grounds will not stay in place, no matter how much I clean the thing. I don't know why it started doing this, but I find it annoying to have to hold the lid down while the coffee is grinding, when I could be using that time to do the other tasks associated with brewing a pot of coffee. So, I'm looking for another grinder. It's adequate, but I wouldn't buy it again."
2,Very Messy,"I feel this unit grinds the coffee just fine. There are a number of sizes; however, be ready for a mess. It is impossible to empty this unit without the grounds going everywhere. I put a towel down and it still manages to go everywhere - the floor, next to the towel and on the towel. There are too many areas on the grinder where coffee grounds accumulate - on the lid, where the grinding comes out, when emptying the collection container - it is a mess."
2,Not for the Avid Coffee Drinker,"It's too slow, too messy, and it is noisy. Dismantling and cleaning usually results in changing the grind setting."
2,Wouldn't buy it again,"I've owned mine for about three years and am now looking for something less messy and less loud. It takes a good couple of minutes to grind enough for a single cup of coffee, and if you're trying to do this while someone is still asleep, household discord can arise. Because the canister for the grounds does not sit firmly onto the grinder, you have to stand around while its grinding to keep it from coming off. Perhaps because the burrs have become dull, for about a year now I have to regularly hit the top of the container to keep feeding the beans through the grinder as it operates; otherwise it gets stuck and no beans are ground. All of this fuss leads to a pretty messy counter. Braun definitely needs to improve on this design."
4,"Good, but not without its drawbacks.","I've had this grinder for about 3 years now, and have generally been pleased with the quality of the coffee. Nevertheless, the design is a lot less than ideal, especially its reliance on a timer and its lack of a readily visible measurement. Accordingly, the only practical way to use it is to determine via trial and error how much grind time equals the amount of coffee you want - and grind only that amount for each use. In my case, 25 seconds is right for my morning mug-and-a-half.Fly-away coffee grounds are also a bit annoying. That said, grinding only what you need and dumping the whole ground-cofee bin into the coffee filter helps. As for cleaning the machine itself, I find no need to do so other than wiping down the exterior and putting the bin through the dishwasher every few weeks."
4,Good value for the money,"I had no problems with coffee fines spilling onto the counter. If others did then they had the lid(s) loose or the catcher was not snugged up against the machine. You should hear a ""click"" when the catcher snaps into place.Yes there is static electricity - thats a characteristic of plastic. Just get a small paint brush and brush out the fines. The use of metal or glass for the catcher would cause other, more annoying problems and would also add to the cost.I had a Krupp before this and the Braun works as well with one minor exception. The Braun throat design for the feed into the grinding mechanism is such that the last few beans fly around and take extra time to be ""captured"" and ground. The Kraup design was such that the beans slid smoothly down the shoot and the last few did not bounce around to the extent that they do in the Braun. Without that I would have rated it 5 Star."
4,Works good but is messy,"The big bean hopper is nice and holds a lot of beans, making grinding very convenient. But, just like the other reviews say, the thing makes a mess. It gets coffee dust all over. But I suspect they all do. I order beans from all over the world and grind fresh for each pot. One morning my wife beat me up and made the coffee. When I tasted it I said ""hey this is really good! What is it?"". She says ""Folgers, right out of the red plastic container"". Go figure."
1,It didn't last 6 months,"Before it was 6 months old this grinder for no reason had the blade break. There's a warranty, but by the time you pay to ship it back and put up with the other hassles, it is easier to just go buy another grinder--not another Braun. It is a pain to buy a premium priced product and get so little for your money."
1,Early failure,"We were replacing an old coffee grinder with a brand new identical unit. The new unit was shipped promptly. Unfortunately, the unit failed in operation on its second day in use. We shipped it back, but we cannot get a replacement since the item is on back order. Our account has been credited. We have never before had any difficulty with the Braun grinder and expect to purchase another when they are available."
2,Short Lived Caffeine Enjoyment,"Got it from amazon in March 2005. It's now December and I've put up with the static electricity (put a brown placemat under it, but it's hard working mechanicals are slacking lately. Need to slap it to get the beans to feed into the choppers. I've tried cleaning it out with compressed air, tapping and poking into the exit chute. Often takes two full cycles to get a decent load of ground cherry seeds ready.If I had bought it from CostClub I would be able to return it and get another just like it, but amazon is no CostClub. Sorry, cannot recommend this countertop tool. Shopping for something else that will hold up to our coffee habits."
2,Messy and complicated,I got this as a gift to replace my simple little grinder that I lost the top for. This thing has way too many parts and is a mess. There are 2 compartments(one for beans and one for ground coffee) to clean and one falls off whenever you pick it up - then the ground coffee falls out of the hole where it connects. The 2 lids fall off of these 2 compartments. It also seems really slow compared to my old little blender style. I am going back to the simple one piece blender type of grinder.
2,What a mess,"This coffee mill was purchased to replace a similar one (by the same manufacturer) that was probably about 20 years old. I wanted a new one because even though the old was was working, it seemed that there was more and more problem with getting half the ""dialed in"" grind and half a very fine grind, which was sticking to the inside wall of the grounds container.I should have been happy with the old one. The new one is at least as bad as the old one in that it delivers two grinds, as above, and the new one is *terribly* messy. As soon as you remove the grounds container from the mill, it sheds coffee grounds all over the base and onto the counter. At least the design of the old one did not have that problem.Now I'll be looking for a better grinder."
5,Braun Kmm30 coffee bean grinder,"This product is much better than the older Braun that we have had for many years. We thought the old one was great but this new one is fantastic, it grinds the beans to the exact size that you determine by adjusting the dial.The grind is very uniform. Would highly recommend it."
4,so far so good,"I just purchased this mill to replace another Braun I've happily used for 10 years, and have been amazed that it's lasted so long. The other was a burr grinder as well, so the mess was not an issue. Live with it if you love coffee! The timer dial was something I hadn't been expecting, previous one had a ""number of cups"" dial instead. I've read people's guidelines on how long to grind for how many cups, I don't intend on measuring the ground coffee, more likely I'll measure out the beans instead. Much quieter than my previous version, and looks like it will be less likely to jam up on dark roasts, with a nice big chute."
4,Good value,"The Braun is simple to use and is a really good value for those looking to get a decent, well priced, burr grinder. Please note that it is a flat burr and not a conical burr, so you won't get that absolute uniform grind, if you're looking for that. I hear everyone talking about how messy it is... of course its messy, its coffee! Good coffee is always messy. It grinds fine enough for a basic espresso machine, and coarse enough for a French press, although there's a good amount of sludge involved for the latter. I can see how it would break down over time as the plastic wears out, but so far its been great for my morning espresso."
2,It's okay. . . I guess,"At first is was fine, but then it started to get confusing, so I stopped in the middle, don't worry- you CAN put this book down."
5,Regarding the Fountain Rocks!,"Regarding the Fountain is a very funny book with a lot of imagination. Kids in a fifth grade class uncover a deep mystery that doesn't unravel until the end... it keeps you reading. Also it has many puns, different ways of presenting the material (like a scrapbook with letters, notes, dialogues, memos ... etc.) so even the presentation is engaging. (I'm writing this review with my 11 year old daughter, a discriminating reader.) We are going to order more of the books in this series now. I think this is much like Diary of a Wimpy Kid, in that even a child who isn't a big reader would be interested."
5,A book of letters,"In this book, two people--Sally Mander and Delbert ""Dee"" Eel--plug up the source of a natural sprign with the drinking fountain for a middle school. Thirty years later, the drinking fountain gets a leak. The school tries to get a new fountain. Sally Mander tries to stop them because if they remove the fountain, they will find the source of the spring. Florence Waters, from Flowing Waters Co., will build the new fountain. During Dry Creek Days, the kids reveal what Sally Mander and Delbert Dee Eel were doing. Sally Mander and Delbert Dee Eel went to jail.One interesting thing about this week is that it was written in letters.I recommend this book to people who like books written in letters."
5,A Great Masterpiece-- A Story of Letters,What an exciting and funny story! This was probably my favorite book ever! I like how the story is told in just plain old letters. It is extremely creative. You better read this book to find out why! If you have any questions or comments please feel free to e-mail me at the following adress. Thanks a lot!
4,Regarding the Fountain,"Regarding the FountainBy: Kate KliseThis is a story about a leak in a drinking fountain and the creek dried up so they need a new fountain. The fifth grade class writes a letter to someone who makes fountains. Her name is Florence Waters. She builds a fountain and it's a big hit. They find out who dried up the creek, it was Sally Mander and Dee Eel!I thought it was a good book. I never read a book with letters in it. My Favorite part is when they get Sally Mander and Dee Eel.I think it would be good for a second grader and going to third.Michael J."
5,Great Book For Kids,"I really liked this book. It's a lot different than any other book i've ever read. The whole story is made of letters sent back and forth, to a few different people. It's a really cute book, and is great for kids. I suggest teachers to read it for your class, your kids with deffinaly enjoy it."
1,Not like they use to be,This use to be a great product. It was changed and has almost no material to absorb.I use them for my small dog. I would not recommend it.
3,A great wee wee pad for dogs!,"These are cheaper, larger, and more absorbent than most any pee pad made for dogs out there, plus most dog pads are made in china, and these are made in the USA. And after being traumatized finding an entire squished mouse inside of a china made dog pad (gridlock brand), I'm comforted by the fact that these are made for humans, so I'd hope that there would be a bit more quality control.The only problem with these is that the surface stays wet for a long time after it is used - which is OK for my girls because they are pretty careful about stepping around their wet spots, and these pads can hold at least 9 pees where as the gridlock pads only held 2 or 3, but if you have a puppy who will walk right through the wet spots, his feet are going to get wet. And come to think of it, why would you want to leave an incontinent human laying in urine? sure these would protect the bed, but the person would get horrible skin breakdown if the pad was not changed right away!"
1,Not what I expected,"This is not the software. It is only a DVD that purports to teach you to use the software. Beware, the high price and the fact that amazon does not carry the actual software led me to believe that I was buying the program."
4,Guaifenesin tablets,"Very affordable alternate to in-store Mucinex, for someone who needs to take this on a long term basis."
4,A book I have been long looking forward to,"I have been looking forward to reading this book for a while and it doesn't disappoint. I felt as though my own thoughts about the importance of gentle yet consistent routine have been put in print. Loved it. I was a bit disturbed, though, by the fact that Mrs. Macaulay mentioned spanking several times, as an acceptable and even positive practice. I personally cannot agree with this particular bit, but still it didn't prevent me from greatly enjoying this book."
3,Good Book,This is a good book. Very similar to For the Children's Sake. Still some great points in it but if your choosing between the two I would pick For the Children's Sake.
2,Not what I expected,"I heard about this author on several homeschooling websites from Charlotte Mason fans. I've read Levison's and Gardner's books about applying Charlotte Mason's methods, and was truly inspired by them. I thought this might be a good book to give me some similar ideas that weren't specifically school-related. Unfortunately, the author had very little to say. She suggested spending time with family and God, but had virtually nothing specific to say. I can't speak on the second half of the book, as I grew too frustrated reading such generalizations to finish(and it is very unsual for me not to finish a book)."
2,Not for everyone!,"My daughter got this for her 3rd birthday. I read her the book several times, and that was her favorite part of the toy. She played with it for about 15 minutes and then wasn't interested anymore. I think this toy would be great for a little girl who shows interest in ponies. Perhaps my daughter is not at the right age to act things out, but I felt that her options with this set were limited, and there was not much she could do with it."
5,Good toy.,My granddaughter is 3 years old and she enjoys playing with the horse and stable. She is very happy with this.
5,friendship ponies stable,I bought this for christmas for my daughter who was almost 3 at the time she still loves it she plays with it everyday. I have 2 older children so ive had experience with fp toys for over 20 years and they are excellent to deal with their toys last & last. they also have great cust svc.
3,Pony Stable,"This toy arrived with several pieces missing.I was not happy about that. My daughter-in-law had to call to get them sent. This is NOT how I like a present to be received. But, this is the first time Amazon has not been ""PERFECT"" with an order for me - and I've been ordering since they started."
2,"Fantastic toy, fantastic price!",This toy is huge...I actually ordered it for my niece who is turning three and loves horses. I had no idea it was such a large toy. She will love it! And I bought it on sale for like $10. Really great deal!
5,Nice book,Great book for basic information on mat cutting for the amature like me. Very useful for many tecniques in mat cutting.
2,Tinny sound and came damaged,I bought this guitar for my daughter from the holidays and it came damaged as the shipper left it unprotected the flimsy box from the factory. Needless to say that was a disappointment but after playing it I knew it had to go back. I knew it was thinner body but this guitar had a toy guitar sound.
3,Not as informative as I hoped,"I was looking for a good documentary about the Cambodian killing fields and that whole genocide situation. This was not really what I was looking for. These are some first hand accounts from both sides, the prisoners and the guards in charge of them doing the torturing and killing. Interesting but somewhat boring. I was personally looking for something more informative. I will keep looking, but this may appeal to you if you just want to hear some personal accounts from people involved as they look back on the ordeal."
1,Great historical perspective; little grasp of China today,"I just finished the book and the pages turned well and I was impressed by the the author's use of past examples. His work on early Mao and Zhou's and Jing's roles were especially important and useful. However, I have worked in the media field in Beijing and Shanghai for nearly ten years, and I feel that the autrhor does lack adequate ideas of the media's role today. A simple monitoring of the major papers such as Beijing Youth, Southern Weekly, PLA Times, and Yangcheng Evening News, would throw many of his propositions to the wind.So, basically kudos to the reasearch of the past, but shame on the author for not realizing that China has indeed changed greatly in the last 6 years. Too bad this was not taken into account in the book."
5,New Fan,"I had the ultimate pleasure of seeing Chlorophyll live. They were awesome, and made a new fan out of me. Equally impressive was the band that followed them ""The Joe Whyte Band"". I highly recommend the CD's of both bands. You will not be disappointed."
4,Great for the true beginner,"I bought this hoping that it would teach me how to create a short film. The story I already have, it's just the skills and schedule that I need. This book gave me a GENERAL IDEA but it wasn't specific enough. It would say, ""then use your compositing softare to put the renders together."" Ummm... How?I know it wasn't meant to be a complete-all-included-only-this-needed kind of book, but even so...I would say that unless you are a true beginner to this field, look for something else, but if you are a true beginner, it is excellent. It taught me alot and I am very VERY glad I bought this book."
5,Excellent!,Product was well worth it! I bought this book for school and I have learned tons from this book already.
2,"Writing ok, short film samples not so much.","I needed this book for a class, so I bought it. It's alright. The authors milk the subjects a bit too much, stating the obvious such as ""it's important to hold an audience's interest"" and ""one really must think about what they're trying to convey"" etc. The samples on the DVD, however, are seriously lacking. There are one or two that show a lot of talent by the creators, but the rest are derivative, overwrought, stiffly-animated one-line jokes without a punchline, or well-animated scenes which have too flimsy and confusing a story to really hold their own. If you want terrific examples of animation and character design from students and pros, try [...] or [...]. I would say ""Inspired 3D Short Film Production"" is worth checking out at a library, but not really worth spending money on if one is completely serious about animation. There are lots of other free as well as cost-worthy resources out there. Try those first."
5,3D Short Film Production is Fantastic,"It's a great book that I would recommend to anyone serious about creating their own Short Animated Film.More informative than I could have ever imagined. It's everything you will learn at a 20,000 dollar a year university.The included DVD is also filled with some great examples.ENJOY and happy film making!"
5,Great espresso!!!,This is great espresso at an unbelievable price. I used to own a espresso cart and now that I am stuck to a home brewer this is a great pod at a great price. Amazon sells this far cheaper than anyone else. Arrived in two days which makes them the fastest too. Thanks
2,Good Coffee. Bad Expire Date.,"I bought the Decaf pods. I am quite pleased with the quality of the coffee. They compare favorably to Starbucks' pods.BUT, when I got them, the expiration date was less than 4 mos away. That seems a bit short for a box of 150 pods. I decided not to return the box I bought (too much hassle), but, don't think I will be ordering again."
5,this is a really nice product. I love it!!!,"These are really great pods. It tastes way better than starbucks, and the price is really good!!!!!!"
1,LATE..OUTDATED..6 MONTHS LATE,STAY AWAY FROM ORDERING FROM THIS COMPANY. I RECEIVED MY ORDER ON TIME BUT TO MY AMAZMENT ALL OF THE COFFEE PODS WERE STAMPED WITH A DATE THAT WAS ABOUT 6 MONTHS PAST DUE.
2,Like Starbuck Espresso Pods better,Based upon the various reviews I decided to give this a try as we normally use Starbucks Espresso pods. I have to say that the taste of Espressione is much more bland and the coffee tastes weaker.
1,Cappuccino without flavor,"I am an experienced espresso and cappuccino maker. I purchased the l'espresso pods because of the reviews on Amazon. Contrary to the other reviews, I found these pods produce a cappuccino without any significant taste,weak and shockingly bland. I have an expensive machine which typically makes wonderful cappuccino and espresso with various species of coffe which I grind myself. The absence of taste in these pods was deeply disappointing and I would urge experienced cappuccino drinkers to avoid them."
4,amazing flavor,"I was hesitant to buy these decaf. espresso pods, but have to say that I'm completely sold on them. Easy to use and the flavor is superb. Bravo!"
2,Fairly Useless,"This is not a listener's companion, it's an obsolete European collectors' guide. Swing music is mostly big band music requiring good reproduction for full enjoyment. Yanow is constantly recommending the French Melodie Jazz Classics, famous for completeness but notorious for poor (if any) remastering. For example, he criticized the Lionel Hampton small group sessions from Decca for their incompleteness, although they are cream of the crop and vastly better fidelity than the more complete Classics. No mention of the Mosaic set that is both complete and magnificently remastered.The mini-biographies are OK, but don't distinguish the best from the rest very well. There's little here that isn't covered better in the Penguin Guide, or on The Web. Well, he does cover the ""Swing Revival"" bands, but I've listened to some of the groups he lauds and found them a pale shadow of the real stuff from the '40s.My copy ended up in the garbage pail."
4,A nice Big Band reference book,"This is a good reference book regarding the Big Band Era musicians, singers and leaders. I borrowed this from the local library and was impressed enough that I bought a copy for my personal use. There are some useful information in here such as albums of interest and some historical perspective on contributions to the art form. Additionally there are reviews of some of the newer swing bands, and their recordings which came to light during the swing revival of the late 90's and early part of this century. i dock one point for lack of depth- for instance there is no entry on the Big Band of Ina Ray Hutton, who was a very popular female bandleader who even had her own TV show for a time in the 1950s. A valuable and useful, if somewhat limited, look at the players and leaders of an unforgetable era."
5,Just as Cute as the movie Legally Blonde,"This doll is soooo cute. I loved the movie, so I had t buy this doll."
1,Wow. Can you say sexism?,Barbie has done it agian. Shes made a mockery of Reese Witherspoon{I LOVED the importance of being earnest} IO mean does anyone else agree with me when I say Baribie is so ... sexist it getting old? Whats next? A ditzy cheerleader? Dear god. Save me.with love...
3,Red White And Adorable!,"This Is So Cute I Own The Movie Legally Blonde I'm 13 I Don't Really Play With Barbies Anymore But It's A Great Collector's Item As For Educational I'm Not Sure Of To Many Thing You Can Really Learn From It But It's Adorable Dispay, And I Think Other Kids Would Love To Play With It! I Rate It As Fun 3 Stars But Thats Just Me But Its Durable! Anyway I Give It an A-!!!"
2,This Doll,I am a 15 year old girl who has over 30 collectable dollls. Usually i get 2 of the same dolls because i have a job and a lot of money. i bought two of these dolls i played with one and it wasn't that fun but it is very durable. How is it Educational? But it is a good toy.
3,Frustrating,"We love Reader Rabbit/ Learning Company CD's, however, this one is so frustrating to the kids... and parents! There is no back button to go to other games, the child plays whatever game they happen to enter into and it never ends. When you DECIDE to end it, you literally have to close out. The parent has to plan on sitting right by to constantly help out (excuse me, I happen to like when they are learning and I can finish my around the house stuff). I gave a 3 rating to be kind to RR/LC but really, this one is a bummer, do not recommend. Disappointed that LC allowed so many flaws to this package."
4,works for my kid,"I bought this for my 4 years old, she really loves it. It's a good productto learn phonics."
4,Pretty good for the money,"This product is pretty good for the money ($29.99). My only complaints are that it seems a little flimsily made, and that you get a split second of static between each mp3. But it does what it's supposed to do. As a clarification of an earlier post by another user, I note that the device does remember which mp3 file you were on the last time you started your car; it just doesn't remember where you were in that file, so it starts the file over again."
2,NOT GOOD,This item came in 'broken' and again it was not ready for use as it had no storage capability. I tried using my own micro SD card on it but it just would not work. It was not worth the money and shipping cost i paid for it!
3,"Good sound, easy to use, mini jack breaks","This device was easy to use and gave good sound with my mp3 player and cassette tape player. I needed to purchase a mini to mini plug extension cord because it was awkward to reach the players when they were plugged in near the cigarette lighter. It worked well for about a month, then the mini jack broke off and fell back inside the device when I inserted the plug. When I opened the device to retrieve the jack I found it had been secured only by being soldered to the circuit board with a thin layer of solder. It appears that the wear and tear of inserting a plug would likely break it off again even if it were resoldered."
2,quit working after a while,"I bought this product a while back. I used it a few times. The concept is very good, however, the reliability is not. I will make a concession that maybe I'm doing something I shouldn't with it, but I really think the product just went bad. I hooked up an external cigarette plug to an external power supply that pushes 2.5A @ 12V DC. A car cigarette lighter is usually 10A 12V DC, or maybe 15A tops, so I doubt I put too much amperage thru the unit. It is possible I put too little juice thru it, but I doubt it, considering it takes almost no juice to run the unit. Anyway, I ran it on a torture test last week, and it failed. I ran the unit for approx. 8 hours, and the screen started flashing, and the unit kept rebooting. The song would play for a few seconds, and then cut out, and then try to play again. My advice is don't buy this unit--buy the Soundfly instead--it's a much better unit. I'll be doing a review on the Soundfly next."
2,Beginning FM transmitter,"This was my first fm transmitter. Definitely a little painful to use. The signal was generally good in my primary vehicle. I listen to audio books and every time I hit a bump, it would reset back to the beginning. Do not purchase this if your cigarette lighter socket turns off when you shut off the car. This was a problem for me. I would have to reset the station and which chapter I was on each time. It was okay for the price but I really do recommend spending a couple of extra dollars and getting the SoundFly SD or similar."
1,This Thing Is Garbage,"This thing only works for about 15 minutes at a time. Then it starts freaking out, rebooting, and not recognizing the plugged in flash drive. I commute 2 hours everyday, and it only worked for about the first 15 minutes into each trip. I wondered if it was a problem with the voltage from my cigarette lighter, but the Soundfly MP3 player I purchased a few weeks later works absolutely fine with it.Bottom line : Don't buy this piece of crap."
4,Lifeboat Music,"I haven't bought this recent release, since I have the 4-CD 1994 release from Folkways. But a survey of the tracks and a listen to some of the snippets indicate that this is essentially a rearrangement and incomplete re-release of the Folkways set. It's incompleteness is the only reason why I don't give it the full five stars.This is what I think of as ""lifeboat music."" Lifeboat music is defined like this: If the ship is sinking and there's room in the lifeboat EITHER for you OR for the world's last surviving recording of this music -- you get out!! This music is that important.The 4-CD Folkways is still the definitive release of this music. But it seems to be pretty much unavailable now. If you don't have that and can't get it, run -- do not walk! -- to get this set."
2,Feels Cheap,"I expected a wood pepper mill which was my fault as the description says no where that its actually wood, it just says walnut which it is. Also the silver adjustment piece on top feels very cheap, you can actually feel the resistance in the plastic when you turn it. If it was not for that I might have kept this for myself, it was originally a Christmas present. It looks like a great product, loved how you can see the pepper down below but it would have broken within a few months. Not worth the price."
4,Quality Product But Does Not Do What I Expected It To Do,This pepper mill is a high-quality product and looks wonderful on our kitchen table and works fine except for one thing. I feel that it doses not dispense as much pepper as it should when using it. A pepper mill of this size should dispense larger quantities of pepper. That's the main reason why I bought it; so that we didn't have to keep turning the mill to obtain a sufficient amount of pepper.
4,"The toy is fun , but can sometimes be a little creepy.......","My little brother loves nemo,so i had to buy it for him.At first i thought it was a little creepy,but it turned to be fun for my little brother.Anyone who is a fan of the movie has to get this toy.sincerly,kenny"
3,Piano Versions of Popular Love Songs,"Some of the songs were speeded up. ""Save the Best for Last"" is the best and most recognizable example of this. The songs weren't bad, but that did affect my opinion and rating here. The CD isn't as relaxing as it might have been because of it."
2,Save your money,"As mentioned befor the unit looks great and works well, for a short time anyway. Bought in Feb 2008. First the leak was a few drops down the mounting plate from under the unit then steam pressure decreassed and then leak got worse. Must find service center. Should have listened to past reviews. Since it looks great and makes good espresso why has it been discontinued? Could it be design flaw???Save your money invest in a reliable machine."
3,Lovely machine but not built to last.,I got this machine a little over a year ago but have had to stop using the steam function because it has developed a crack in the steam block which makes it quite dangerous to use.What's worse is that I can't find anyone in the UK willing to service it. Think twice before you buy it - it did work perfectly for a year but now it looks like I'll have to buy a new machine and I won't be buying another one of these.
3,The Leaky Luna,"I bought the luna about a year ago and fell instantly in love with it. It is fast, convenient, and makes a killer espresso. Unfortunately it now leaks water when trying to steam. I believe it's coming from the heating block since this problem has been mentioned before. I am currently trying to contact the service center to see about getting it fixed. My last coffee maker/espresso machine cost $300 and still works and is 10 years old. I like quality but to me that also means reliability. When spending this kind of money on a product it better damn well be durable or at least servicable. If the service turns out to be good and I can get my Luna fixed I'll update this review."
5,LUNA Has Excellent After Sales Service,Please send an e-mail to info@electra-craft.com and they will gladly service your LUNA wall mount machine.I own this machine and have found it to be awesome. We've had some technical questions and the ESPRESSIONE people are fantastic.Recommend the GRACE PG with great confidence.
3,Fairfax has discontinued this product,Thanks for your suggestion. I buy my coffee pods from Fairfax. I asked them and they said this machine was discontinued and that they did not stock spares :(If you know of anyone who has parts please let me know.Graham
5,excellent small grinder,"I have a automatic cuisinart burr grinder and i;m not so hot on it. I also had a braun grinder that i gave away, thinking that i upgraded to a better grinder. Um, in a heartbeat i would gladly trade it back straight across. The cuisinart generates a LOT of static electricity and makes a big mess. The braun i only had to sit and press the button for about 8 seconds and, viola! a beautiful grind for my 8 cup coffee maker. I loved it. and now i miss it. It held up to 2-3 grinds a day for 2 1/2 years and was still going strong when i gave it away. I highly recommend buying one of these braun grinders if you need a good one."
1,Broke in first use,"I was excited to grind some expensive coffee I received as a present so I tried to use this product right away. It worked well at first but then the blade started to freeze up. After removing the semi ground coffee and moving the blade around (unplugging the unit first of course) to free it I tried to finish grinding my coffee. I stopped very soon when smoke began pouring out of the unit. Maybe I got a dud, but beware of this product. Seems you get what you pay for."
4,** I OWN THIS * A WORK HORSE **,"This is a basic, excellent, sturdy coffee grinder. I have purchased a few fancier ones to see if they do anything better and they don't!! I bang this coffee grinder all over the place on my kitchen cabinets to shake the freshly ground coffee that can sometimes stick to the sides and it still works well... I have had it for 4 yrs. Don't pay more for something that I doubt will do anything more than just grind the coffee. My fancy GE one broke and the others were just nice looking. Braun makes excellent, well constructed products."
2,broke!,The switch on ours broke too; the whole piece just came off the lid. I have to fiddle with it to put it back on every time I want to use the grinder (which is why I'm replacing it now). I think we'd had it a month when it broke.It's not too loud and it probably does as good of a job grinding consistently as you can expect from a grinder in its price range.
5,The Best,Was so happy to find the Braun Coffee Grinder again. Owned one before that lasted 20 years. Wasn't able to find another in the stores around here and went with another brand. Was totally disappointed with other. Then found and ordered and used again. Very happy that the product has NOT been changed and is as good as ever! Will always use this model and brand. Thanks Braun....
5,Braun Coffee GRinder Review.,I received the coffee grinder in about a week. It works even better than the same model that I replaced. I am totally satisfied.
1,Piece of Junk,The switch broke on the first use. The cost of shipping to replace it would have been more than the unit.
2,"Do not wash with water, just wipe it","Bought this grinder to grind coffee beans only but I made a mistake by washing only the metal part with water. Of course I did this with power unpluged and I did not put it in the dishwasher nor submerge it in the water.Well after using for awhile (6 months), the motor freezed so I took it apart and found it got rusted where the motor connects to the blade. I did not read the intruction so I don't know if the instructions mention anything about cleaning this."
1,Worst coffee grinder,"I bought this June 6th. I only use it week days. This morning, it is broken. It will NOT TURN ON OR GRIND. I WASTED 8 MIN OF MY TIME BEFORE WORK. DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF JUNK.!!!!!This deserves a big fat zero NOT 1 star."
3,"Good Coffee Grinder, Bad Coffee-Grinding Method","The Braun is an excellent coffeegrinder for its kind. The problem is that you will inadvertantly under- or over-grind the coffee with this kind of grinder. Invest into a (slightly more expensive) burr grinder, where you can set the coarseness, and you'll be a lot happier."
4,Works Great,"I'm not a coffee expert, and this is the first grinder I've ever used. I have used it every day for the past 6 months and it works great and in my opinion grinds wonderfully. An excellent value."
3,Impossible to Clean Out Pepper Dust,"I like this peppermill combo, but I find it impossible clean out the pepper dust that clings to the sides. What is the point of having a clear peppermill when it is clouded up with dust? I tried calling the company, but they didn't have any good ideas for cleaning it. They want to sell me some ""triple cleaned"" peppercorns."
1,Will not fit 2011+ Mustangs V6/V8,"Please note this filter will not fit a 2011 Mustang V8/V6 as Ford built the filter into the fuel pump. Amazon site shows it as fitting either vehicle, which it does not."
4,"""He walks the savage path alone...""","When Kunisada's mob boss/father figure is murdered Kunisada wants revenge but his gang wants to call a truce to prevent an all out war. Kunisada is angered by their cowardly actions and back stabbings so he just goes ballistic and kills the hell out of everybody.Very cool movie and one of Takashi Miike's best overall efforts especially the action scenes...absolute perfection. The garage fight scene alone is worth watching the movie, but fortunately you get more action scenes including the last 15 minutes of the movie.And don't forget the performances, Riki Takeuchi is cool, but my favorite is Renji Ishibashi! I love that guy he always steals the show. Check out his facial expressions, especially when he sees Rekka in the hospital! Man I laughed so hard I had to rewind the movie.Thank you Mr. Miike for making such entertaining movies."
4,Fun little mystery.,"Fun little mystery series. You do not have to read the previous books in the series to read this book. The Author makes a few references to previous characters and events. Small town mystery with small town characters. Kind of a Murder She Wrote but with a male lead and a Lighthouse Inn as the setting.Overall a fun little series. No swearing, no sex scenes - just a fun little mystery."
2,these shoes stunk.,"the shoes looked way better on the picture. they aren't very durable and after wearing them once, they were really dirty and had creases at the toe."
3,Not Pfitz Or Calvino,"I set about reading Andrew Crumey's new book with the highest of expectations. I absolutely loved his Pfitz,. Alas, this was a big mistake and fatally doomed any possible enjoyment of Mr. Mee for me from the start. This book is not at all as good as Pfitz , and not close to being in Calvino's class. My major complaint would be that Crumey doesn't really decide which genre his novel should inhabit. As a result, Mr. Mee wanders back and forth between fabulous history, incredible happenstance, quantum physics, literary criticism, sexual frustration, and just plain exhaustion. If you like Proust (I don't), you won't like Mr. Mee, but you will learn something interesting things (maybe) about poor Proust (and others). But to what end? The book is fairly clever, well-written, an easy read, moderately funny, but generally pretty thin stuff. It won't stretch your mind too much or engage your sense of wonder, as Pfitz might. Then again, it's not Pfitz (or Calvino)."
4,What a find!,"I am facing the year 2009 with the prospect of no more paid work looming, so I have been haunting Amazon and second hand book stores and Op Shops, buying up books and stockpiling them to read in my enforced retirement. Mr Mee, at 50 cents, is an absolute find. I couldn't wait! I have been sneaking a look inside whenever I can, and I shiver with delight thinking about the time I can collapse in a hammock and read and read and read the delectable Andrew Crumey ..."
1,"Do not buy this necklace, you will be disappointed","The locket on this cable chain is so tiny, you will not be able to put a picture in it. After opening the box and being completely disappointed, I opened the locket to see how it worked. It would not close properly after opening. The quality of this necklace is not good - do not waste your money."
2,"Pretty, but not durable","My 5-year-old daughter was thrilled with her locket. It is really beautiful. We were both quite disappointed, however, when the locket itself broke...the loop that attaches to the bail completely came off. She is a normal kid, but was not overly rough with the necklace. It is currently at the jeweler's to be fixed."
2,locket is very small,"We bought this locket for my daughter, and had it personalized with her initials on one side, and the year on the other. This is such a small locket, that it will be very hard to put a picture in it. Also, the locket is very, very hard to open. The top of the heart wasn't closed all the way, so the locket kept falling off the chain, we had to have it fixed. Now it stays together, my daughter loves it and wears it every day, but I would have bought a different locket if I had realized how small this is, and that we would have to do some repairs on it before it could be worn."
3,flimsy chain,"I bought these lockets for the little girls in my family. I thought they looked nice, and I liked the way they came with a template so they could cut out and insert pictures. The size and style seemed perfect for young girls! I was disappointed that my 7-yr-old niece managed to break her chain almost instantly."
4,Very Decent Locket--What Do People Expect?,"We bought this locket and chain for our four year old and she loves it. Yes, the space for the photos is tiny, but, hey, it's a tiny locket for tiny people. Don't buy it for a ten year old. Price has increased greatly since last Fall, so it's not as good a deal as it was then. That said, the clasp on ours is still working, the chain is not broken, and the finish on the silver is still bright. It's fine."
3,esteban's instructional method for the guitar,"the dvd is not what most buyers expect...see... the ad about the dvd is very vague..reviews about only one dvd rather the five...the instruction is in my opinion not for a beginner, and specially for a person that has never touched a guitar before....It would be great for me to get my money back when I return the item...please advise..Neo-mesa"
3,Fun But Not as Sturdy as It Should Be,"My almost three-year-old grandson loves this set, especially the drum. The drum has a good sound - satisfyingly loud for him but not annoyingly loud for grown-ups. His nine-month-old brother enjoys accompanying him on the maracas, which are a good size for little hands. The drum, drum sticks, and maracas seem sturdy. However, when banged together, the painted tambourine stick and the painted castanets chip badly. Thus, the tambourine stick and castanets shouldn't be used to make music by banging them together, which is exactly what a small child would be expected to do with them! This would be a better set if the manufacturer made the tambourine stick and castanets out of unpainted wood or heavy plastic."
5,Not just for 3 year olds...,"We bought this drum set for my daughters 1st birthday and she absolutely loves it!! She walks all around the house shaking the maracas and then brings me the drum to beat (she also beats the drum too). And she loves the other shakers too. The age recommendation is 3 years, but is perfect for younger ages too. My nephew also has this set (also 1 year old) and we gave it as a gift to another 1 year old girl. Have fun making music together!"
3,Maracas can break,"Set was fun at first and appeared to be very well made. That was until my son was playing with one of the maracas and it broke open spilling hundreds of tiny BB looking objects. They appear to be made of lead or some other metal. I have called the company, but I have not gotten a response yet. Just hoping that they were not filled with hazardous materials. It certainly wasn't filled with pebbles like other maracas we have had were filled with.UPDATE: The company responded with a list of materials used. All were nonhazardous steel alloy. They were very apologetic and offered to send a replacement or another item of equal cost. Great customer service. All of the other items (besides the maracas) have held up well."
5,drummer boy,grandson's christmas gift. He loves it! He's less than a year old and a kinder music fan (with mom and dad)
5,My daughter wanted a drum... She's 5.,"My duaghter really wanted a drum for Christmas this year. My husband and I did not feel that she is quite old enough for a full on drum set, or even old enough to appreciate a snare drum. We thought this drum and instrument set would be a good starter for her. She is only 5, and we also don't have the floor space for a ull on drumb set. We have not yet pulled it out since it isn't Christmas yes, but I can tell you that I was really impressed and excited with the quality of this set. Good buy for the quality and the learning experience that my daughter will get to have."
1,Fun but beware,"I received this music set as a gift from my mother-in-law when my son was 18 months and we absolutely loved it. Fast forward one year later, and one of the maracas cracked open while my son and nephew were playing with them. Tiny metal bbs spilled out of the maraca and onto the carpet. Although I cannot say what kind of metal the bbs were made of, I can say that they were very soft, had a shiny lustre, and felt quite heavy for their size. Luckily, neither of the boys tried to put the bbs in their mouths, but I was nevertheless terrified. I would have expected that the maracas be filled with some kind of natural material, not metal of unknown origin. I feel bad that I ever let my son play with this set."
1,doesn't work well,"This product has a cute name, but it is very difficult to use. I constantly have to take the nutmeg out and re-adjust it. Larger nutmegs do not fit in the storage area. It's a lot of work to get a little bit of nutmeg - disappointing."
2,"Chunks and Flakes of Nutmeg, Not Ground","I got the nutmeg twister specifically for adding nutmeg to the top of homemade eggnog. Its elegant design makes it a lovely addition to the table. Unfortunately it produces flakes and chunks of nutmeg which seriously detracts from the enjoyment of smooth and silky eggnog. I also like to add freshly ground nutmeg to homemade horchata. Even coarsely ground nutmeg would be acceptable, but again the chunks and flakes are unpleasantly left on the tongue. This texture would be acceptable in baked goods, but just doesn't work for beverages."
1,High priced nutmeg crusher!,"This grater has heft and looks good. Outside of that, it functions very poorly. It is a constant battle to work with - the nutmeg ends up being crushed in the chamber before it ever comes close to being ground, shaved, or otherwise milled by the blade mechanism. It is a frustrating and annoying piece of equipment, not just because it fails to grind nutmeg in anything like a consistent manner, but also because the stored nutmeg just constantly falls out when you keep having to take it apart. By the time you have managed to persuade the thing to shave a few sprinklings of meat from the nutmeg, you have opened and re-set the thing countless times, turning the air blue with the verbal frustration prompted by such an annoying contraption! I am singularly UNimpressed."
3,Good concept,"I like that this shaves the nutmeg rather than crushing it, but it come open a lot, which makes it hard to be efficient."
1,Frustrating nutmeg grinder,"I splurged on this grinder because I didn't want any more shaved knuckles with my old microplane grinder. What a disappointment, for all the reasons previously mentioned. I brought it back to the store and the owner did a few adjustments with the nutmeg and got it to work. Same story when I got home after a few grinds. Too much adjusting and wasteful. I have ended up pounding my nutmeg in a mortar and pestle. Good idea, poor product."
2,Creationist bias,"The glossary entry for ""anthropic principle"" begins ""The principle that the constants of nature are tuned to allow for life and intelligence."" Tuning something is an activity that demands intelligence.Actually I think the most intelligent thing the designer ever did was inventing evolution."
3,"Parallel Worlds: A Journey Through Creation, Higher Dimensions, and the Future of the Cosmos","This book is actually to be a Christmas gift, so I haven't opened it. It arrived very quickly and in good condition. Thank you for expediting it."
3,Ruined by anthropic discussion,"Much of the science presented in the early parts of the book is watered down by the extensive time wasted discussing the strong anthropic principle. I found it disappointing that the author thought it necessary to present all of the ""but if"" arguments."
4,Good Overview for the Layman,"This is the first book I have read in this field and I was encouraged to read it when I overheard an NPR discussion with Kaku while washing the kitchen floor one day. For me the power of this book (and of the man himself) is its ability to excite the interest of the layman. As a wannabe teacher, I find Kaku's presentation to be brilliant in terms of his ability to excite his audience and give them 'wow' moments. Sure, maybe he doesn't present a totally complete and unbiased opinion of the subject matter (although I am not one to judge this), but he may spur the interest of a few of the next generation of comologists and to for me that is what is important - keeping people informed and turned-on to science so that they will pursue the subject and generate the next round of discoveries. I recommend this to all who love to learn. I only wish I could attend Kaku's lectures..."
3,"Interesting, at times hard to follow","Surely, Prof. Kaku knows his subject matter, and he knows how to write. His explanation of string theory and M theory were understandable for a layman like me.However, when he applied this to cosmology, it became confusing for me: There seem to be endless possibilities for baby universes, multiple universes.... it almost sounded more like science fiction. Surely, this is due to my limitations, rather than to Prof. Kaku's knowledge of the subject matter. It seems, that a firm understanding of our universe(es)is still far away."
4,A Good Overview of Modern Theories,Overall a well written overview of current theories in physics. My one small complaint is the description near the end of an advanced civilization's attempts to escape a dying universe. The author seems to either deliberately ignore or be unaware of the predictions of the coming singularity and the migration of humans to software.
2,Disappointing,"I bought Michio Kaku's book thinking I would find new material and insights, given its 2004 publication date, compared to Brian Greene's 'Elegant Universe' from 2000. In fact, Kaku's book seems to me less informative, less well explained, and covering less ground, than Greene's. At some points it seems like you can feel the author giving up before the difficulty of explaining his material without maths."
5,Parallel Worlds: A very good read,Have always admired Michio Kaku's work. Detailed explanations of terms and activities within the cosmos that others fail to fully elaborate on.
4,Basic and Understanding,"This book is easy to understand and you really see the basics of cosmology without having to understand equations and the whole physics works. Its easy to read and it totally boggles your mind. It gives you definitions where you need them and it explains to you everything you need to know in the most simplist way. I recommend this book to any beginner or even just the typical reader who finds space and comsology interesting. I, myself, never read about cosmology ever in my life before. When I read this book, it was simple, logical, and really made you think. The author doesn't tell you what to think or believe, he opens your mind to a bunch of different possibilities so you can see the whole picture. He names all the theories and ideas and let's you draw your own conclusions. This book is just a source of interesting facts and info about cosmology without any scientific gibberish that is unpronouncable. It's truly great."
4,Great book on cosmology!,"This book gives a better view of cosmology and the exploration of other ""worlds"". The reason I gave this book a 4-star rating is that it sometimes goes into a little too technical detail, which can be a little bit confusing for the beginning reader of cosmology books. For the most part, this book explained a lot about cosmology, and gave me a greater sense of the world we could really be living in."
5,Very interesting and thought provoking book.,"Michio Kaku has a way of delving into the unknown and unknowable that can blow you away. If you are into cosmology and the big bang, this is a must read."
5,"Clear, Comprehensive, Credible","This is probably the best book on this subject, mainly because of its unparalleled clarity. There's not much unnecessary information, coverage is fairly comprehensive, and subjects are mostly treated with great clarity (for which the reader should be very grateful considering some other books in this field) without suffering loss of understanding. In other words, the presentations are correct and self-contained, interesting, and enjoyable to read. There are few seemingly odd tangents that must be tolerated, and the author promotes himself a bit from time to time, but overall this book really stands out. Reading this book is like reading a dozen other longer books about more specific aspects of this subject yet receiving the same key information ... more bang for your buck! You don't need a science background to understand this book."
5,Personality Disorders,"This book represents a seminally important contribution, taking us reassuringly through heretofore murky and uncharted waters. Prof. Livesley convincingly integrates and reconciles neuropsychological, social and psychiatric perspectives on Personality Disorders. The author and his contributors deliver a broad set of information for the clinicians involved with the treatment of Personality Disorders and with the research on this, yet fresh enough and deep enough to prove useful to the most experienced specialist."
2,Problem Luncheon,"This bag is functional but it has problems.Firstly considering it only holds up to a 15 inch laptop it is BIG although it doesn't look so in pictures.Secondly it has very few compartments. Two largish compartments on the bag and a webbed pocket on the flap. If you plan to carry any more than a few flat documents around then forget it. Extra compartments to seperate phone/wallet/pens/batteries/etc. would have been welcome.So to sum up the luncheon is a very big bag which holds very little. Also it has the stupid design flaw of having gaps in the top unless you tuck in the sides when the flap is closed. What's the point of a bag made from space age, waterproof material if there are gaps which let in rain? Stupid.On the positive side it is quite stylish and the fabric is really tough. If you plan to pay over $100 for a bag then you should expect better design than this."
2,She was dissapointed,I gave this as a gift to my niece who is a die hard Nemo fan. She was disappointed. It was cute but really just a stuffed animal...and she did not recognize the character from the movie she watches nearly every day! He has no expression and the head sort of tils down...it was not the best gift...
5,Grace Amazing,If you are trying to understand the awesomeness of God's Grace this book will point you in the right direction. Steve McVey has hit the traget when it comes to explaining God's Grace and how to walk and live in it. I recommend not only this Title but also Grace Walk and Grace Rules. Steve McVey backs all he says in these books by God's Word. GREAT READING. HIGHLY RECOMMEND
5,Christ Life is enough,One of the best Christian books I have ever read!! A must read for all Christians. How the Isrealites and an individual Christian today are related.
1,Poorly Written :-(,"As a 'gori' fan of KishoreDa I was very excited to read all about him but sadly this poorly written, barely edited bio was a big letdown. The other bio,Method in Madness,looks like the better bet."
3,kid loves it but throwing mechanism is compicated and breaks,"My kid loves these toys but they are kinda complicated to throw after a while and tend to stop working. Great as a simple action figure, however."
5,Suite Iberia,"I'm not familiar with this work in CD's, but I remember it very well because my father had the 33 LP original version, which was very lively and reverberant. If the CD retains all these good features for sure it should sound great"
1,Just get another phone line!!!!!!!!,"I purchased this product and have had nothing but problems. The first one I bought was no good had to return it. The second one allowed me to answer my phone but wouldnt display the name. After about 20 calls to customer support, the tech. told me that my win modem was not compatible with the hc3000. This was after having to search for the proper ID box, Putting my phone company through the ringer and a couple trips to the store. Just put a second phone line in the house you are better off. Unless you dont mind putting an older slower modem in your CPU, and paying well beyond an above what you expected to."
4,Great Idea!,"We've used the HotCall box for several years now & wouldn't be without it! Granted there are a few improvements that could be made (the ringer is LOUD with no volume control & only the phone connected to the box can answer, so if you're in another room R-U-N), but overall this product has served us well. Only occasionally am I knocked offline even after hanging up from an answered call within the 10 seconds allotted. I think that problem stems more from the telemarketer on the other line NOT disconnecting right away rather than from the HotCall box not reestablishing my web connection. We are constantly telling people about the box after getting a busy signal while they've been on the web. It's certainly worth the money we paid for it & cost us a lot less than a 2nd `internet dedicated' phone line would run a month!"
4,not your usual comp,"If you love the hi-hat and the beat of disco you'll love this collection. It's mostly underground stuff from the late 70s and early 80s, and there are some real gems here: ""Bourgie Bourgie"", ""I Don't Want You Back"", ""Feel It"", ""In The Forest"", ""San Salvador""; they're all here, and they mostly sparkle like pixie dust."
3,Not as good as I thought it would be...,"Just got this a few weeks ago and it's not as nice as I thought it would be. It does not go all the way to the top of the captain's chair of our Odyssey. There's probably a good 8 inches to the top. So, the picture of this is a little deceiving. With that being the case, my daughter's Britax Decathlon still leans against the seatback. I also thought it would have an elastic band to hold it to the seatback, but it doesn't so you have to hold it up while putting the carseat in, then straighten it out if it falls a little bit. It also bunches on the bottom when the carseat is strapped in tight. I guess not a big deal, but something to consider. So, if you looking at this, I'd go with the deluxe model. It may have more features that are better."
2,Not large enough for use in SUV,"I purchased this for use in a large SUV. We have a Britax carseat and this carseat protector is not long enough to cover the seat from top to bottom. I also expected it to be thicker. We use the latch system and it pushes the carseat hard into the leather. I am not happy with it at all for our application. Although, I have been searching and have yet to find another product on the market that seems large enough or tougher/ thicker!"
5,Awesome,"My child is a 5 month old. The car seat has a plastic base that is mounted in the car. The wife's car has leather seats... so to protect the seat, I was using a towel. This is so much better."
4,"Protects the seat, but pocket is hard to use-unaccessable.","I bought this cover to protect the leather seats in my Toyota Highlander. It does protect the seat, but the pocket at the bottom isn't very useful for us as it's hard to get to since the baby's car seat is still rear-facing. I'd have to really get down and under to use it and it is small, so that hardly seems worth it for me."
1,Crummy seat protectors,"I have a new car and wanted to protect the seats. Found these, they looked great but don't fit properly on the seat, they're not as big as shown in the picture, they don't stay up as shown in the picture. I should return but am too busy to hassle with it so I just try and make them work, but I truly should take the time to return them."
4,Works well on cloth seats,Fits snuggly on cloth seats the elite version seems a better fit for leather seats in other car but this is more than usfficient for the cloth seated car.
2,Ordered the wrong brand and disapointed,"I ordered this thinking it was the one I got for our other car which was from Sunshine Kids. The products look almost identical, but the sunshine kids is longer and covers more seat area for the big car seats. Also, the material is thicker and quality of protection is superior. Wish I hadn't tossed the box for this one or I would return it. The Kiddopotamus is OK, but in comparison it is just not as good."
5,Great product.,"This product is everything it's description promised. I am thrilled with the way it covers the seat, stays in place and can be used with either a tall back safety seat or booster seat. I bought 2 and will be purchasing a 3rd!"
1,Does it protect or just cover?,I give it one star because this is really just a covering mat. It doesn't protect leather seats from indentations because it is too flimsy and not thick enough to distribute the pressure from a car seat. I don't understand why some people give it three stars while writing that they've experienced the same issue as I have. If it doesn't proect then it shouldn't get an average star rating.
4,Makes a big difference,"I have one of these under both of my kids' car seats. I swear by them. If you use a car seat for a few years without this, you will end up with uncleanable marks and deep impressions on your seats. Put one of these down on day one and you avoid most of that.I wish they had even more padding or stiffer material on the horizontal surface to protect the seat underneath even more, as after three years I'm getting impressions on my seats even with the seat covers. But it's a lot better than the seats of my friends who didn't use any protection.Good product."
2,"Good quality, but shorter than expected","This is a good quality merchandise but after installing it in my new car I noticed that the product is a lot shorter than the top of my seat. The car seat I have has a large piece that goes across the top to secure it to the car. This cross bar was just above the top of the protector so I had to place a small towel in between the seat and my car to help protect the leather.The picture is very misleading, but overall still a good piece of equipment."
5,Excellent product,I would definitely recommend this to others. I had been using this for my new born infant seat as my car is having leather seats.Very good quality and excellent product.
5,The Best,"If you're thinking about buying some other Pocket PC, or Palm (God forbid), don't!This PPC is worth every cent!!!P.S.: It comes out with a free Windows Mobile 5.0 OS upgrade in October, I can't wait!"
2,2/3 of this is too difficult,"I have a bad back (fractured my spine unknowingly when I was younger, and never had it looked at), but my spine doc said yoga in moderation would be good. Now, let me start by saying that I have had three Rodney Yee tapes or DVDs and every single one was too hard for me to do. Either he moves too fast from pose to pose, or he does poses that end up straining my back. The AM part of this is no exception. His poses are too difficult. The PM part of this is all right if I could do it more slowly but it's hard for me to keep up with the instructor. However, the DVD is worth it just for the Suzanne Deason part (Stress Relief) which is calming, easy on the body, and makes me feel good when I'm done. (The AM and PM make me feel cramped and sore right away when I finish.) So now all I do is the Stress Relief one. Worth it though!"
4,good for starters,The AM section of this DVD was a nice introduction to yoga and I still find it a nice way to start the day (Rodney Yee on the beach in Hawaii doesn't hurt either). I have progressed on to the Total Body Yoga DVD but I still use the AM section for a relaxing start to the day. The stress relief person has a voice that does not lend itself to relaxation. PM section is more strenuous and a little harder to follow but a good workout.
5,I like it!,"I am new to yoga and I have enjoyed the am and pm 20 minute exercises. I have not tried the ""stress relieving"" one though. The p.m. one really gets you relaxed and ready to lay down and go to sleep. The a.m. one gets your blood flowing and all stretched out from being stiff from sleeping.I feel it is good for beginners - with room to challenge yourself and improve."
2,Not a work out at all,"My husband and I had been doing a 20min. beginners yoga video by Rodney Yee and were looking for a little change up, so I got this video. It's terrible in comparison. The segments are supposed to be 20min, but half of it is spent talking so you don't get to do many moves. They also don't hold you in the positions for very long. I suppose for a very very beginner and for someone who needs to figure out how to relax and isn't looking for the stretching part of yoga this would be a place to start.On a side note the choice of clothing for the instructors is distracting in a very bad way."
1,This is barely even helpful for beginners,"I waited on this product for quite some time, and was highly disappointed when I finally received it. I enjoy doing yoga, and consider myself to be in the ""Experienced beginner"" range. I find this to be more mediatation oriented, as the instructors provide very VERY basic moves that relax more than invigorate in all three vignettes. This was marketed in a misleading manner, as I think this is intended for those looking for a mediatative guide, or someone perhaps that has been injured and is restarting the workout process. Or for someone that is just beginning their work out routine. The only endearing quality that I can find is that this offers the viewers a detailed content section on the DVD selection menu. I am an avid fan of Rodney Yee, and even his segment was a complete disappointment."
2,Not that great ...,"I recently rented this DVD. Thought I would try before I would buy. I enjoy Rodney Yee's AM section. His voice is calming and it's very relaxing but he doesn't hold the poses very long. Suzanne Deason's voice is annoying and she is like ""Speedy Gonzalez"" ... waaay too fast to relieve any stress. Did nothing for me. Patricia Walden's PM was too difficult. Again, too fast! She doesn't tell you how to change the positions. I didn't find it very relaxing. I'm happy I only rented this."
2,"The All-Day Yoga Workout-A.M., Stress Relief, and P.M. Yoga",Bought this DVD used but am taking it back. I'm fairly new to yoga--took 2 5-week sessions with an excellent instructor. I was looking for something to do at home when I can't make it to class. The poses were too fast in the stress relief segment and there was way too much use of the brick (she must have said brick a hundred times). The P.M. session was just too silly. Rodney Yee is good but the rest of the set is not.
4,Good programs but DVD setup is bad,"These three yoga workouts are very nice to have if you need short, relatively easy sessions. I do agree with other reviewers, however, that some of the poses are rushed and the transitions are difficult to do in that time.My biggest complaint is with the setup of the DVD, however. Even when you navigate through the three menus to get to the session that you want, you have to sit through the intro with the instructor explaining what exactly he or she is going to do in this practice. Of course you need that the first time, but after that I'd like to get right to the beginning of the practice. But they've disabled the skip-ahead feature on the DVD! The only way to do it is to fast forward and then take the chance that you'll miss the beginning and have to back track.I have just started using this DVD and I suspect I'll get tired of it soon simply because of that feature."
2,"Scenic, but boring","I am just beginning yoga and found this DVD quite beautiful but exceptionally boring. The yoga instructors are quite good and Rodnee is a peach, but both are not very athletic looking. Rodnee was nice to look at but had no personality. I hope they can get more exciting instructors to do the series over again."
4,About the DVD Chapters,"To be able to skip the introductions, you need to be able to locate the Chapters on the DVD. I am making this note because it took me a bit to figure out where the Chapters were. (Wish they were on the Main screen!) From the Main Menu, go to the Bonus section, where you'll find the Chapters area. Then you can specifically pick which part of AM/Stress/PM you wish to begin with, skipping the introduction.I am making this note after reading a comment an earlier reviewer wrote."
2,"Beautifully shot, but needs more instructional detail","The scenery in this DVD are gorgeous, but for a beginner it needs more detailed instruction and some of it just moves too fast. I like workout videos that are attractively filmed but for yoga I'm willing to sacrifice a bit of beauty for instruction. I was really looking forward to the stress relief workout but I can't get through it. Suzanne Deason might be a great yogi, but I'm having a hard time getting past her voice and find her direction had to follow. The ""extras"" on poses and props are good. Overall, a nice looking package but I had to get another DVD. This one just didn't give me enough of what I need right now - more detailed instruction and less distraction."
2,Dull & Boring,"At times, it's nice to have a relaxing yoga session, but this one was boring. There are three different sessions to choose from, AM Yoga, Stress Relief & PM Yoga. All three were much too simple. The flowing poses in Stree Relief were nice but I didn't find them to relieve stress. If you're inflexible and new to yoga then maybe this would be suitable but if you have any yoga experience, pass on this one. Thankfully I was able to rent this."
3,OK but a little too difficult for a beginnner,"This has many great poses, but some need more explanitory time for a beginner."
1,Save Your Money!!!,"I just bought this yoga tape today -- and threw it away today too. I have been doing a couple of the [other] workouts (the long ones, I can't stand their short ones either) lately. I think thieir explainations are more detailed -- such as ""how to breathe"" and the stretch is held long enough to get a benefit. AM/PM goes way too fast and it is too short. There was hardly any coordination between breath and movement in this. SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!"
3,It's OK..,"Just purchased because I thought it would be fun to make smores with my daughter on cold winter nights. It takes longer than I thought it would to get the marshmallows really heated through. I guess I should have realized it would be that way when I was adding the heating element: a 60 watt candelabra light bulb. My daughter liked it but her attention did wander while the marshmallows ""cooked""....."
3,great for 1-7,i geuss if you have kids and you want them to make thier own get this but if you can work a stove use that
1,A waste of money and time,"Why waste money on this stupid toy that makes you wait FOREVER to cook a marshmallow with a lightbulb, when I can make smores in my microwave in 15 seconds? Obviously marketed to people without brains."
1,Waste of money...,What a waste of money this thing was. We were all excited having a little camp out for my grandson. Took out the Smores maker and all the ingredients. Plugged it in and started cooking the marshmallow.We waited and waited and the marshmallow never got soft enough to make the smores. I ended up having to make them over the burner on the stove.Save your money and just fire up your stove.
4,Good and Bad...,"Our son(7yrs.) loved it. But We had to wait so long to machine to warm up, and marshmallow to get softened(don't get browned).Safety wise, this is an excellent toy for young children.For us adult, we need to get real s'more maker...just around 15bucks, I didn't expect too much.It might not be good in our eyes.But like I said, Kids loves it!!!A good conversation goods. :)"
4,Safe and Fun,"Even though it takes a while for the marshmallow to melt enough to be yummy, it does not make the food really hot so that it safe enough to let my youngest use it. Clean up is pretty easy as you can just put the ""sticks"" in the dishwasher. The (round, candelabra base) bulbs are extra, of course, so make sure you have some before the kids get their hands on it because they may want to use it right away! The device will shut off if knocked over, which is good. We also don't move it until after it cools off so maybe the bulb will last longer. We have s'mores about once a week.If you want s'mores fast, use a microwave. If you want them at their yummiest, use a campfire. If you want them safe and fun for kids, use this and your imagination and use the wait time to take a break yourself and spend some time talking with the child(ren) about camping and preparedness and stuff!"
1,Worst Toy Ever,"It does not come with the light bulb needed to use it.I have been to THREE stores trying to find the right bulb.The bulb is an odd size and wattage, very very hard to find!"
2,poor performer,I bought this toy at christmas because my daughters love to make smores. I have been dissappointed though since it does not seem to get hot enough to actually melt the marshmellows. I have bought the recommended bulb at the recommneded wattage and it still does not seem to work very well. This toy has been dissapointing.....
1,what a dissapointment,"A huge waste of money. It's a light bulb to soften a marshmellow, with a plastic housing. A COMPLETE waste of money."
1,Worst Christmas Toy,"This was the worst Christmas present underneath the tree. BEWARE - my seven year old was not fooled by the plastic campfire aparatus and the metal center that ""roasted"" the marshmallow. The fact that the marshmallow doesn't turn one eensy, bitsy brown takes away from the real camp fire experience too. Save campfire s'mores for the real thing if you want to keep the fun food special. Otherwise, go for the microwave - my seven year old has more fun watching the marshmallow expand in the microwave than pretending to roast one on this machine."
2,Boring,"This book was filled with so much details and facts that it was not only difficult to read, it was also boring. Nobody wants to read about stuff like this. If it wasn't for the big names of the authors, it never would have been published."
4,Great stocking stuffer.,My 4y/o loves retro toys and loved this as well. We had to shorten the string to make it a little easier for her. Both her and several adults have played with this and so far everything is still in tact.
1,Buy a Garmin,"I bought the X9 to take to Afghanistan with me as a backup navigation tool. Fortunately I did not use it as a primary tool. First, when it arrived, the battery would not completely charge after the first charging. I was able to send it back to the supplier and received a replacement. When using the X9, it is slow to aquire satelites. The Garmin that I was using for primary navigation is much better, quicker and more reliable. After using the X9, mainly for a watch, it just stopped working after about 6 months. The display went blank. By that time, I no longer had the box or receipt. I sent Suunto a letter requesting some kind of support. They never replied. Buy a Garmin and save your money!!!!!"
4,Runaway Train,"I really like this movie, it is exciting, and has moments of humor, to help spice up the scary stuff. Hard working men, doing brave, manly stuff, and saving the day. What's not to like?"
4,Keeps you on edge--never a dull moment,Denzel Washington is excellent as usual. This is an exciting story. It keeps you involved on several levels. There is the human interest side of it with the family situations faced by both lead characters. Then there is constant danger to those on the train as well as thousands of others if the unstoppable isn't stopped. Even if you have narcolepsy you will not go to sleep!
3,movie review,i had this movie recomended to me to watch. i liked but wasnt crazy for it. im thrilled that my kindle fire provides movies to watch if so enclined its great to watch on the small screen anywhere you want.
4,Very Under rated film from the late Tony Scott,An exciting ride for a film that only takes place on a train. Great performances from both Denzel and Captain Kirk!
3,"Stop this camera, I'm going to be sick","Good film until somebody thought that it wasn't exciting enough and the camera looked liked it was being held by somebody on their eighth cup of coffee. Really, the script, the acting, it was all really good - why ruin it with over the top panning and camera shaking? Could barely follow the last half of the film. Like JJ Abrams and his abortion of a Star Trek film."
1,Shaky Camera,This is another shaky camera movie to make you barf!!! Couldn't watch it as it made me motion sick.
1,Please stop cussing!,"There is only one thing I thought was unstoppable in the movie was the cussing. My Dad always told me why people cuss is because of their lack of intelligence to do any better. I thought Denzel Washington was a Christian! How could a Christian even be apart of this film much less watch it or accept it? A Christian friend of mine told me it was good but after hearing 3 or 4 GD""s (God to dam someone) in the first fifteen minutes of the film I had to say ""that's enough!"" Some people say ""well everybody does it and you cant escape it"" maybe so, but one day we will all be accountable for what and how we dealt with sin Christian and non-Christian alike"
2,Done before,"I confess rarely like Denzel Washington movies, this one is no exception. The story is extremely contrived. Some idiot lets a train loose and of course, its full of toxic chemicals, that can destroy much of a city. Then we have an evil business owner more concerned with money than peoples' lives so making it worse, a manager who is a white and also more concerned with money than people who makes it worse, a black woman and she is both a manager and a good guy and Denzel Washington, who is both the victim of this cruel business and the hero. In the meantime, we get a few hair raising scenes, nothing that seemed believable.The acting was reasonable. Chris Pine's character development was I thought bad while Denzel Washington, who is a good actor played well.I do like a good action movie but I think the story just let it down."
2,Somewhat boring/ corny,"Short Attention Span Summary:1. A train carrying toxic chemicals gets out of control.2. Two guys spend a whole movie trying to get it under control.3. They finally do. The end.Since there was only this one conflict in the film, forgive me for thinking that it was a bit boring."
1,OMG,"This is quite honestly the worst film I have ever seen. I stuck it out to the very end just to see how bad it was going to get**SPOILER ALERT**At the end of the film they stopped the train, and until that point nothing interesting happens!I read some of the other reviews and I agree with whoever called this film Contrived"
4,GOOD BUT NOT GREAT,"Similar to SPEED but not quite as good. Tale focuses on a train that gets out of control and starts to pick up speed, creating danger for the community. Washington and Pine do good to very good jobs with their characters but some of the supporting cast members are more memorable. There's some good heart pumping action moments in this film.Overall, I thought this would be a great film when it was only good. It's hard to describe other than I didn't feel every scene overlapped properly, but, since this isn't film school I won't go into the details. Overall, a good movie and better than most but not ""A"" quality. I found the last few minutes to be cheesy. CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B to B plus; STORY/PLOTTING: B minus to B; ACTION SCENES: B; WHEN WATCHED: end of March 2011; MY GRADE: B."
4,Unexpectedly Engaging,"Unstoppable turned out to be an unexpectedly engaging movie. The ever consistent Denzel Washington plays the veteran but helpful taskmaster to a perfectly cast Chris Pine. Pine blends a slightly arrogant streak with the realization that he can learn a lot from the cagey veteran. The film incorporates the ""up yours"" attitude towards management that audiences will relate to. Rosario Dawson plays the part of the go-between between management and labor perfectly. The sustained ""action"" of the train is surprisingly well-maintained throughout the movie. Kudos to Tony Scott, the director, for another well directed movie and to the editors. I saw this movie in the theatre and bought it for my wife because I thought she would like this action movie...and she does. I recommend it."
4,Good suspense thriller,"I want to find out what this was based on since apparently it really happened. Nice job of location filming in PA, good performances from Denzel, Pine, and Dawson in the lead roles; suspenseful action sequences as a train rushes out of control down the tracks with perilous toxic cargo.Good action flick."
3,Dos'nt quite reach the heights,Worth a watch with some good action.Denzel Washington gives the same wooden performance as he has done in most of his last few movies.Seems to be going through the motions.
5,Amazing!,"I have always thought Denzel Washington was a good actor, but in this movie along with Chris Pine, they are amazing. Surprisingly good movie. Usually in modern movies you can not get action without guns. This movie's director is very skilled."
3,OLD-SCHOOL ACTION FLICK DELIVERS!!,"It's rare when an exciting theatrical poster doesn't even begin to convey the true action of the film it's advertising! UNSTOPPABLE is old-school filmmaking notched to the nth degree. Instead of photorealistic computer effects, director Tony Scott uses real railroad tracks, engines and cars for the high-speed race against time to stop a runaway train laden with deadly, volatile chemicals heading for Scranton, PA. It's all ""inspired by actual events."" Denzel Washington is the veteran engineer and Chris Pine is the novice conductor and it's up to them to resolve personal differences and bring this impending epic disaster to a halt. Rosario Dawson costars. The Blu-ray is loaded with interesting and watchable extras."
5,Unstoppable,OMG! what a thriller! Love Denzel in this..Also loved him in The Taking of Pelham 123. Highly recommend it. Thank you for the prompt and courteous service. Looking forward to future purchases.
4,Very good,Just rented this movie from Amazon instant video and ejoyed it very much. Not a lot of unessary drama to make it more exciting the story facts were enough.
5,great movie,A great movie for the whole family to watch. Lots of drama and action that keeps you on the edge of the seat.
4,Exceptional,"I bought this movie for a friend because she was born and raised in Pennsylvania. She wanted to see the countryside. It turned out to be a very riveting, exciting movie. I enjoyed it more than she enjoyed the scenery.Denzel Washington has always been a good actor, but this time he was exceptional. Chris Pine also did a remarkable job. This is definitely one worth watching. And worth watching more than once."
3,Very Entertaining,I like trains so I decided to watch this movie. It is very exciting but the story line is very predictable.
4,Unstoppable,It was a decent movie. Kind of predictable but was interesting. Never saw the movie before and it was fairly cheap during black Friday so I bought it. Would probably not watch it again but was good to see once.
2,unstoppable (blu-ray),"The beginning was good, it looked promising. But then it took a step back and then it became predictable to what was going to happened. And also at the end of the movie we have 2 guys who cant stop the train, and then like all superman movies this other engineer comes out of nowhere with his pick up truck and saves the day. The special effects were awesome, the beginning looked promising, but it was just that ending that ruined it."
4,Good flick,Pretty much all possible. The basics are all accurate. Mistakes compounded endanger many. The most unbelievable sequence involving firing at a fuel tank has a basis in fact. But they were trying to empty the fuel tank (3500 gals) with a bullet. A dangerous profession even without the special effects. Good time.
3,Runaway Train it ain't!,"I was really hoping that I would like this movie but as most movies these days,it was a let down.For an action movie it was kinda boring.It was predicatable.The character background of these 2 guys were bad and I felt unncessary.Especially Denzel's story about his 2 daughters.Denzel looked bored with his character.The camera work was bad.Some parts were unrealistic and they copied the scene from Runaway Train when Chris Pine's character hurt his foot.If you want to see a good train movie,I suggest Runaway Train with Eric Roberts.At least that one will hold your attention.I would give this movie 2 1/2 stars but since I can't I'll round it off to 3 stars for the special effects."
3,Ok for a rental,"This was a okay rental. Glad I waited until then to see it. Very typical. The woman that plays Connie wasn't a beleivable actor. She loves playing with her hair...up & Down, Up & down. I wouldn't have gotten the HD version ether."
4,AWESOME!!!,"Very cool scenes. Not at all what I thought how it would end. Originally missed the ending due to the plane landing with about 20+ min left of the movie. Second time saw more stuff that I missed the first time and, the ending was vey cool."
4,Unstoppable action at every moment,"A nice action move that moves slightly away from the Speed movies and creates a hero to root for. Good charaters, good casting, nice story."
2,Too Predicable,"Tony Scott is much better than this. He has produced many great movies but this one was just ok in my opinion. The title basically tells you about what you are going to watch leaving little to really see. Maybe a different title and few adjustments here or there could have made it better. Overall, if your a Denzel Washington fan for sure worth a watch but look towards 'The Last Boy Scout' or 'The Taking of Pelham 123' for a better Tony Scott production.Peter J. Miller"
3,entertaining enough,"though i did enjoy this dramatic action thriller,i thought it was missing something.there was drama,to be sure,and plenty of action.but it was not as thrilling as i had hoped or expected.there was enough tension to keep me watching,but none of the 'edge of your seat 'or nerve shredding intensity.it wasn't boring,by any means but compared to the tension in Crimson Tide,for instance(also directed by Tony Scott)there was no comparison.Scott really reigned himself in here(which he usually has trouble doing(see Domino)but in this case,he could have let loose a bit.still,the movie was entertaining enough.for me,Unstoppable is a 3/5"
2,One of the most boring action films in recent memory,"So this film is literally all about a runaway train. That's pretty much it. Denzel Washington and Chris Pine's characters spend the last half hour of the film trying to be heros and stop the train all by themeselves in their own little train, going backwards. Oh and of course there are dangerous chemicals onboard the runaway train and of course it is heading towards a highly populated city where it will surely run off the track if no one stops it and disintegrate everything in the area. Oh, there's a pointless subplot about how Pine's character has a restraining order and can't see his son and wife and of course Washington's character has a small issue with his two daughters too. I'm pretty sure I covered the entire movie. That really is it. Zero suspense, predictable ending and can't forget the cliché characters!"
4,lizird tracks,"good ole time action and saving Clementine(town) from the clutches of bad man leroy brown(train)! give it a 4 star, its a keeper. the azlizird"
2,love the movie - problems with the dvd i ordered,"has anyone else had trouble with the dvd, ordered from amazon? mine will not play the middle bonus feature about putting the story/script together. all the other bonus features play fine. so it can't be a problem with my dvd player. this is the bad thing about ordering through amazon. if i had just bought it at best buy i could actually talk to someone about it and find out if others have had this same problem. is it a problem with just this one dvd - which seems unlikely - or were there others made, which just won't play the middle feature? the commentary plays, the feature about the train plays and the sneak previews play - so how can it be that the one feature won't play. there are no prints or marks of any kind on the back. i played it the day i received it and it hasn't been touched except on the outer edge - the playing area itself is completely untouched and unmarred. i've never had a dvd do this before?"
5,Just Awesome,"This is an amazing movie, one of the few movies that I watched twice in a row. While this is not for the person who is looking for your gory or your shoot up bang bang action but it is a really good action movie none the less. It is not really slow pace, more that the intensity builds up, starting small perfectly bringing it up to the climatic moments. The character background and buildup is amazing, making us understand why the characters are where they are at and why they are willing to do what they do now. The whole movie is well put together, and believable, there is a flaw or two, but nothing that you really care about because rest of the movie fits together so well. And if you ever thought that a movie about a runaway train could not be insteresting, well then...maybe you need to check this out and see if this will change your mind."
3,Unfreaking Believable,"This movie although action packed is definitely not for someone, such as myself, who work in the rail industry. It's filled with things that just don't happen and you will find yourself critiquing the entire movie. With that said railroaders enjoy it for what it is... an action movie."
3,Lot of Action,"I didn't have high expectations from this movie, but all in all, it was a very good movie in every respect. Acting, script, casting, etc all great, with lot of action.The plot is fairly simple: an incompetent employee makes a mis-judgement and lets the freight train go unattended, without brakes, under power, with a dangerous cargo. The rest of the time the people from the corporate headquarters, the yard master, employees, the local authorities, all have to deal with this problem. In the end the two low level employees become the heroes by saving the day. Everybody go home now!That is one problem with this movie: no surprises.I still recommend it, it is a great movie to watch."
4,Bitches,"Why in the world did Will take Darcy back ? He wasn't good enough for her when he was climbing up the ladder, but suddenly, he's the super-hero, I wouldn't return her calls like she did to him. And Denzel's bitch daughters, I would never speak to them again. But other than that, I liked the movie very much !"
1,Boring,"Famous actors, but it's unbelievably predictable, shallow, booooring.It felt, from start to end, like something we've seen a million times."
3,UNSTOPPABLE IDIOCY!,"Mind set for a mindless thriller....check!, Popcorn....check!, brain removed....check! 'Unstoppable' is a very fast paced and fun ride, just keep in mind that there are some extremely ridiculous and unintentionally funny scenes. Slickly made with a likable cast, the film never rises above ""edible garbage""(I know you love that term Andrew!:-D!). As long as you know what you're in for you'll have fun watching this silly action flick."
2,No Brakes On a Train,"Unstoppable is a really pedestrian film that bad in all departments except that Denzel helps drag it above the quality level of an episode of Burn Notice. The basic premise is that a train carrying some toxic chemicals has been sent on its driver-less way because the driver decided to get out of the hotseat after pressing the ""Go"" button. The obstacles and problems are all the sorts of things you'd get at a Screenwriters 101 course:- There is a train full of schoolchildren coming the other way.- The head boss corporate guy is trying to cover it up and/or cut corners.- There's a nice little town in the way that looks like Main Street 50 years ago and it's going to get wiped out.Although not a total train wreck (excuse the pun), I think director Tony Scott needs to step up his game."
1,worse than clowns from outer space,"Good acting, great cinematography, worst story line ever! There's not a whole lot you can do with a run away train movie. Everyone but Denzel in this movie is portrayed as moronic ineptitudes. The new guy that never held down a job, can't count how many cars they're pulling, makes every wrong move, ends up a hero. Denzel works the two levers that control a train really good. Helicopters escort the train thru the whole movie but can't land a driver on it. Stupity runs rampant as sheriffs deputies mishandle everthing, and cause crash scenes. Someone should blacklist the writer and put him out of our misery!"
1,Turn your mind off...,"...and enjoy this popcorn-flick?? Rather blow out your brains! Poor script, action-sequenses so overdone it makes the Lethal weapon-movies seem deep and realistic. The characters are so unsympathetic you don't care about who gets run down or not. The beginning was promising yes, but not longer than when the train takes a stroll on its own, if I'd been a railroad-worker I'd really be offended by this movie. These guys here appeares as idiots one by one. The ""best"" part is when Denzel becomes Indiana Jones and jumps his way across the runaway-units before one of the worst endings I've ever experienced at the cinema.Based on a true story?? ""Runaway train"" - watch that instead. Not a true story, but far more believable!"
1,horrible,"this movie was bad and I usally like Denzel's movies. It was bad mainly because they could've stopped the train when it was only moving as fast as the two guys were walking next to it. then after that it was just boring. please give me only $20,000 and I could make a better movie than this."
1,Unstoppable Crap,"This movie has ton of action and ""so-so"" acting. As Denzel washington is one of the most overrated actors of our time with no real depth in many (not all) of his movies. If they were going to make the movie so unbelievably unrealistic, they should of went a step further like they did in the Movie: Wanted, at least it wasn't trying to pretend that it could really happen. At least that way you knew you were getting the Hollywood fake ridiculousness. But this movie tries to be something it's not. Realistic. Maybe cause I have a strong passion for trains and a couple of my friends work in the Locomotive industry. So many better movies that have just as much action, but don't try to be something they are not. Plus you won't have to watch a Train through the entire movie solely. Move on to something else and stay away from Unstoppable Crap."
3,It's Denzel but not his best movie.,"I am a Denzel fan, no doubt, but this movie just didn't do it for me. Almost all the movie is based on him inside the train which was kind of a bummer. I know, that's what the movie is about and I don't hate it but it just didn't grab me. There were some nicely done scenes where are tense but overall, it's an ok movie for me. I got this on a lightning deal and it's for my husband, a Denzel movie collector, so it's good to have as part of it. Overall, I've seen way better Denzel Washington movies."
2,"Lightweight, Predictable Entertainment","SPOILERS!Let me sum up the movie by answering five questions for you.Will the runaway train be stopped? (yes)Will any significant characters perish? (no)Will there be lots of hand-wringing and moments in which corporate leaders are shown to be fools? (yes)Will there be lots of bravado banter? You know, that kind of humorous, sarcastic, jovial ""well gosh, look at the peril we're in"" chatter? (yes)Will there be moments of near catastrophe that will cause spectators to raise their fists, cheer, and feel good about being alive? (yes)Will there be a heart-warming ending for estranged family members and those who pulled together to avert disaster? (yes)And that , in a nutshell, is this film.Performances are fine. Editing is rapid-fire. Direction is workmanlike. Dialogue is uninspired.Watch and forget. If that is what you're in the mood for, this will fit the bill."
2,Barely Adequate Movie w/ Lots of Profanity,"I wish I had watched this one before I showed it to my kids. All in all an adequate show. The profanity though brings what would have been 3 to 3.5 stars to two stars. Sorry, I just don't need it (neither the movie nor the profanity)."
3,not to happy,"The movie was good, but while I was watching it there was an interruption and the movie froze. I had to fast forward pass that part."
1,Awful.,Literally the worst film I have ever seen. I'm not normally one for writing reviews but this is up there with '2012' (with John Cusack) for ridiculousness and I feel compelled to write about it! The continuity errors are ridiculous from the start and the fact that it is based on true events make the people involved seem like morons. Police shooting at a stop button on the train which is next to a fuel tank - genius. The only thing that could have made it worse would be for John Cusack to pop up with a 2012-esque performance. Denzel Washington is the one bright spot but I think it is time he moves away from train-based movies... Avoid this film at all costs.
1,Worst movie ever made! Totally Unbelievable and not a representation of reality!,"I knew this movie was bad before I was talked into watching it! I am a professional locomotive engineer, and this movie does not represent the way it is in the railroad industry. Hollywood got so much wrong on this one that I don't know where to begin. But 99% of what happened in the movie could not happen in real life. If you are a career railroader by profession, a rail buff, or a rail historian, don't even waste your time with this awful movie. What an insult to my intelligence!"
3,"Not bad, not bad","It was a good movie, however it was a little too slow paced. It was almost 2 hours long without any death scenes, with a good amount of explosions, and not enough anxiety for me. Not bad, however before I started watching it, I expected a terrorist attack, not just an uncontrollable train by a mistake. So it was a little less action. Still, this is the movie that I was looking forward to see and it was OK."
5,Shipped fast,This came within 2 days for me. Not a classic but any standards but ok flick. Blu-ray quality. fair price.
4,Better movie than I thought,"The actors really make this movie great. Denzel is Awesome as the engineer of the train displaying the old wisdom of how things were done. The other actor who coincidentally is also the new Captain Kirk in Star Trek is the new hope for the railroad, and they say they don't type cast in Hollywood. Immediately you have two people that have a reason for conflict. The movie portrays how these two men can set their differences aside because of the circumstances and work together to avert a catastrophe. Kind of sounds like what the American people say congress needs to do to avert the Fiscal Cliff. The movie has drama, action, and a really fast train."
5,great edge-of-your-seat movie...,"to D. Vaughn, a reviewer below : What planet have you been living on?? your comment: ""its about time they made a movie in Pennsylvania"". Brother, they're making ALL kinds of movies in the Pittsburgh area. More movies being made in Pa right now than anywhere besides NY and California. ""unstoppable"", ""next three days"" and ""love and other drugs"" are all Pittsburgh PA made movies that were in the theater at th exact same time late last year. The economy is just fine there (much better than it is in CA)Anyways....this has some great scenery and keeps you glued to the screen. Has good replay value too. I thought going in that this may be a ""cliche"" type movie that i would hate, but actually i really liked it. Just ordered the Blu-Ray."
2,Unstoppable,"Loosely based on the CSX 8888 incident (also known as the Crazy 8's incident), Unstoppable starring Denzel Washington and Chris Pine (of Star Trek fame) was an okay action film. It tends to drag in parts and was pretty corny in others, but knowing that this wasn't an action film in the truest sense nor was it a true documentary I managed to keep my expectations low and was surprised that I liked it. It's not a great film but not completely horrible either. It's something to watch when you want to kill time."
3,It's a bumpy ride,"After reading the reviews on this movie I decided to buy the DVD. While I liked the story line and the action, I should have taken my motion sickness medicine first. Did the director strap his camera to a hummingbird? The constant moving camera angles and tight pans had me feeling nauseous. Why do directors think this is how their audience wants to watch a movie? Though certainly entertaining, this movie should of had its cameras stuck to one track."
3,All Aboard,"It's a cliche to point it out, I guess, but cliches became cliches for a reason, and there's still pleasure to be had when they're put across with the skill and conviction of this runaway train saga. There probably isn't a moment in ""Unstoppable"" that we don't see coming down the track from a long way off but, in the age of Michael Bay (not to single out the poor man), an old-school action movie that takes place in the ""real world"", sans robots, vampires, wizards or excessive CGI, is a welcome relief. Just a crafty, fun entertainment for those evenings when you wish you were as brave and wise and competent an engineer as Denzel Washington. Hope there's no sequel, though (""Unstoppable II: Snakes on a Train!"")."
5,Excellent album,"I had the opportunity to hear a full album of orbital and loved, had heard the song ""One perfect sunrise"" with Lisa Gerrard is terrific."
2,2.5 Stars,"#1: 6/10#2: 9/10#3: 9/10#4: 5/10#5: 4/10#6: 2/10#7: 1/10#8: 2/10#9: 5/10I dont know what happened, but I was enjoying the heck out of this CD, and then at about track 5 they started morphing into really awlful, jolly tracks that sounded nothing like the first three. None the less, I like 1-4 and number 9 so much that I feel like it was still a good buy. Tracks 2 and 3 are standouts. All in all its just not the best electronica I have ever heard."
5,whole >= parts,The true whole is greater than the sum of its implemented parts or partialities.Consider it thusly:PantsTunnel VisionLostYou LotBath TimeOne Perfect Sunrise ** ForgivenessReflect accurately and responsibly in accepting the right to establish rightly the collective definition of our future.
3,Should have left off at the altogether,I am extremely dissapointed in this album. After completely and utterly falling in love with the altogether I was expecting wanting something different from this. I understand that possibly because this is there last album that they wanted to do something more similar to their earlier stuff but it seems like with their last album they had really grown and I was hoping for the end of an evolution and instead I have this. Songs that seem to go nowhere and some puzzling experimentation. Let's just wait until the boys put out some solo discs to see whats up.
3,A few good moments in here...,"I was introduced to Orbital, like many, when they released their album ""In Sides (Saint)"" and they joined the ranks of Underworld, Prodigy and other big dancefloor names, back in 1997. It's been a long road since then and with the ""Blue Album"", they seem to have lost some of their original edge. Though there are a few good moments in this (their supposed farewell) production (""Pants"" being one and the closing track ""One Perfect Sunrise"" being another one), most of the album is either a bit bland or a rehash of their 'good ole' sound, so don't look in here for much original quality material from Orbital. Seems like they're pretty much done."
2,"sorry, but...","i love orbital. i really and truely do, but am i most definitely more of a post-snivilization kida guy. for most fans the blue album is a blessing, becuase it is the one most like the green album since, well, the brown album. oh man i'm a nerd. anyhoo if you like old school orbital you will love this. however if you are more into snivilization and in sides, you will agree with me when i say this final album sounds like some dj remix of a u2 song. in conclusion, i love orbital so i love this album but it is difficult to recomend it."
3,Eh.,"What facinates me about Orbital is the fact that they started with such a bang and then slowly declined. With the beginning came Snivilisation and The Brown Album, two instant classics with hits all across the board, no part of either album left me bored. But then they've had a few dissapointing albums such as: The Altogether, and The Blue Album, but it seems like each record they produce they get at least one catchy song. For The Altogether that would be Tension, and for The Blue Album it would have to be Transient and Acid Pants. In my opinion Orbital has had a long prosperous career with definite ups and downs, but thats what life is about, having your ups and downs and in their case its was their music."
2,Waste of Time.,"It reminds me of the saying that if you think you should write a book about your life, Don't."
5,Soli Deo Gloria For Lotti's Fine Masses,"Here are three of this early 18thC composers masses of the Venice school, which have also received praise from Pope Pius X. It has constant harmonic tension with flowing melody and fine instrumental orchestration soaring around, above and inbetween.This is fine performance by Camerata Pro Musica Chamber Orchestra and Lotti Chamber Choir all conducted by Ferenc Rozsa. Especially captivated by the Gloria in D Major, which is particularly glorious with its fine solo vocalists framed by baroque instrument flourishes! Magnificent!"
1,Dusk to dawn dud,"I got one of these lights after my 175 watt mercury vapor light failed. It was about 7 years old and had served me well.I thought that this compact fluorescent was better as it used less power and was widely proclaimed. It most certainly isn't better, it is junk.I noticed that it isn't quite as bright but I adjusted to that. What troubles me is the 2 year life and a company that won't answer my questions. I get the feeling that I'm stuck with a lemon, one that's only 2 years old and no parts are available.You are on your own when you buy this Chinese light of spotty quality. I dread having to climb way up in the air to replace my light fixture every couple of years. Don't buy this Regent/ Cooper light unless you are a gambler!"
3,A good book,This book is one of my favourites. It provides load of information about all sorts of breeds. It fills some gaps not covered by some other books.
4,wonderful historical narrative for bibliophiles,"The husband-and-wife writing team of Nancy and Lawrence Goldstone deliver a delightful history of Michael Servetus and the book that got him killed -- a volume considered so infamous that all copies were ordered destroyed. Only three copies are still known to exist, making it one of the most valuable books in existence. The authors bring to life the man and his times, discussing religion, science, literature and history as well as Leibniz, Voltaire, Calvin, Priestley and Osler, incorporating a vast array of knowledge as they tell the story of a genius and his tragic end.There are a fair number of illustrations, a bibliography and an index."
4,Great book - too much extraneous material,"This was a great book that finally gives credit to one of the overlooked figures of history. If you weren't aware of Michael Servetus, then 99.9% of the population are your brethren. This book explores not only his theological genius, but also examines his invaluable contributions in fields as widely varied as medicine and cartography. His long lasting impact on our political and religious life is also explained in fascinating (and well documented) detail. The authors are gifted historians.It is this strength that also becomes the sole weakness of the book. The authors endeavor to capture the full historical context of the world in which Servetus lived. However, too much marginally relevant context is introduced, which in some cases served to detract from an otherwise great read."
5,Michael Servetus - Etched in my mind forever.....,"What a fascinating book. It is superbly written and almost impossible to put down. Nonfiction history books that read like bestselling thrillers are hard to find indeed. But that is definitely the case here.Throughout the ages, how many individuals have markedly changed the world we live in, yet are not found in most history books? The name Michael Servetus is one that should be known by any serious student of Western Civilization, yet sadly his story has been missed by so many historians.Kudos to the authors for a job well done."
5,A Must reading for UUs,"This book reads a bit like a mystery, a bit like a biography, and very much like a history of the life and times of several of the ""greats"" we all hear about. The interplay between Servitus and Calvin is of particular interest. Certainly, this book would give anyone a better understanding of the times, but in particular, Unitarian Universalists will find an important part of their history in these pages."
2,History keeps repeating itself.,This is a tale of two rigid and megalomaniac men butting heads. 500 years hasn't changed human nature - that's for sure!
5,A wonderful find!,"I bought this book after it was mentioned in a talk about Michael Servetus. I am not sure what I expected, but I was completely surprised by the enjoyable narrative, and the wide range of interesting topics woven together throughout the book. In addition to the history of Servetus' book, we get a broader look at his life, his interactions with John Calvin, and the background on key players in printing/publishing, science and theology over several centuries. Highly recommended!"
4,Out of the flames,"Excellent blending of past and future historical events and persons, from reformation through the development of Humanism. Compelling story. I usually pass my books on to others. Not this one, this will be re-read."
3,Enjoyable for the most part,"First, let me say that I am a big fan of Neil Gaiman. That having been said, I enjoyed Endless Nights, but couldn't stay with the stories about Delirium and Despair- the artwork was just too distracting. Not that it is bad, mind you. For me, it's just too abstract to work with following graphic stories panel after panel. I would still recommend this work for Gaiman fans. My satisfaction with most chapters easily outweighs any disappointment in a few others."
2,If you need a sandman fix I suppose this fluff will do...but,"I have followed the Sandman series from the first issue and I was really excited about this lastest offering. However, I found this return to the material less than entralling. The best stories are Desire, and Destuction. I don't even want to discuss the tacked on Destiny tale. The scraps that Gaiman throws his fans are few and far between. The Dream, Delirium, and Despair chronicles seem like onanism on the part of the author and the heavyweight artists he recruited. Readers should avoid this work and spend their money on the new Lucifer series by Mike Carey it's a continuation of the character from The Sandman and it's the best dark fantasy series to date."
2,Only for ones who buy comic for art AND diehard Gaiman fans,"As I've heard before, Gaiman decided that Sandman story should end at the end of Wake, his tenth Sandman book, and I've heard he'd eventualy do minus one Sandman story, that is a story before Morpheus' imprisonment in Preludes and Nocturnes.Mr Gaiman begins to write novels, and suddenly, we first have Dream Hunters, which I skipped, and after that Sandman: Endless Nights.I read 5 stories outta seven, because I disliked McKean's art and because I saw Milo Manara's story was sex, brutality and violence.I must admit Preacher artist did a GREAT work, just like Frank Quitely of New X Men fame and Dream story artist. Sienkiewicz' work and P. Craig Russel's work are good example to prove why they are superstar illustrators.The only story that Gaiman shouldn't be ashamed of is one with Dream...others can never be compared to best days of Sandman,"
2,Print Too Small,Even in the blow-up frames the print is simply too small and the images are too cramped. The visual medium of illustration and words suffers greatly.
3,The Sandman: Endless Nights,"Some of the writing was overly flowery, some of the chapters were utterly incomprehensible...and yet, there's just something there that draws the reader in. I found it irritating that the art was different for each chapter, and would have really liked to have seen unity both in illustration and plot. I still don't know what the overarching storyline of this was supposed to be because there simply wasn't one. Particularly disappointing was the 2nd chapter, falling into the graphic novel trap of excessive nudity with absolutely no purpose. I didn't need to see that, it served no purpose. I really did want to learn more about the Endless, though, and I found some of the dropped plot threads to be really intriguing, and I just want to know more. I hope some of the issues are cleared up in the next few volumes, because I feel like there's a really good story somewhere beneath all the clutter.Rating: 3.5/5"
4,"Impressive, but not his best","As always, Neil Gaiman has managed to concoct a compilation of superb, fantastical, and even slightly (very) insane stories. And I love them all.That said, there _are_ many things missing form this compilation. It's left too many unanswered questions -- and as much as we all love a mystery, some of these could have (and, in my opinion) should have been answered in the seven stories. Delirium's and Destiny's stories left me slightly confused and waiting for more, in particular. It felt like there was too much left unsaid.Endless Nights is still a wonderful read, but a little bit of the magic and enchantment in the original ten Sandman novels is gone. It's a book that enriches your knowledge, but SHOULD NOT -- under no circumstances -- be read before the other books."
4,good toy,"I bought this scooter for my daughter's 4th birthday. She loves it. We did encounter one problem though. Her foot kept hitting the training wheels when she would push. Since she wasn't ready to go on just two wheels yet, my husband took ONE of the training wheels off. This works great! There is still one on for balance, and her foot doesn't hit anything when she pushes. She loves the bag on front, too."
5,From a linguist,"I am a trained linguist, but Friedman's ingenuity and delight with language far exceeds my own. His 17 techniques for uncovering hidden meanings have lent themselves to many a d'var Torah in my household, and the examples alone make the book worth reading."
3,Beware of incompatabilities.,"It works just fine with the original, Firewire iPod, but not at all on the newer iPods."
1,Does not work with new iPODs,Nowhere in the description does it mention what iPODs are compatible with this charger. I assumed the charger would work with all iPODs but it doesn't fit the new 4G iPODs!
3,Not what's in the picture,"This is an excellent briefcase, especially for the price, but it is not the briefcase shown in the picture. I ordered the black product as a gift and was surprised to receive a different style. The black briefcase is the same style as the briefcase shown in the grey and blue pictures, rather than the briefcase shown in the black picture."
2,got lost in all the other toys,"My daughter has this and played with it a few times. She lost all the pices that go with it. It didn't amuse her. I would be temped to recommend it to a younger child, really into Cinderella, but I can't, because of the little pieces. Good for a mom who wants to sit with child and pretend with her."
5,Very Relaxing,I enjoyed this book very much. I kept it on my coffee table and would color in it to relax. Now that each page is colored I have moved it to my bookshelf.
1,BEWARE... ONLY 22 Designs... and I only like 10 of them,"This was a HUGE disappointment... the description did NOT say there was only 22 designs... amazon's LOOK INSIDE feature's ""Copyrighted Material"" covered up that important line... this is an over-sized book so it sticks out from ALL my other coloring books... If you love coloring mandalas as I do... SKIP this designer and BUY MARY ROBERTSON'S Mandala books that have 50 designs in... all excellent... so... I look at as I paid full price for Mary's work and got this inferior one free. Sorry, but I feel very strongly about this... I guess I'm supporting Monique's retirement???"
2,Disappointing,Very few Mandalas to color for $10.00. I bought this as a gift but I would be embarrassed to give it. Way overpriced!
5,Just do it!,"The book sat around for awhile, the markers I used didn't work well with the paper. Then I started with colored pencils, now I'm addicted!"
5,Beautiful mandalas...,I love love love these coloring books! My favorite thing about these books is that are good enough to frame when you done with the picture!Colored pencils work best on these books!!Relaxing coloring book for adults!!! I'm a mom of 2 and at the end of the day this is my escape...Recommend to all adults ...men and women!Please let me know if my review helped you in your purchase !
5,Makes everyone happy,"I've used this coloring book myself for years! I've given it to family and friends as gifts, as well as using in my holistic nursing practice with my patients. It is so popular with patients and family members, it is now even stocked in our hospital gift shop. The author is right: it works for all ages, children to the elderly. It is especially wonderful for anxious times of waiting---in a doctor's office, before surgery, for news on test results, for the repairman to show up, etc.Coloring these mandalas seems to have a magical effect on people. Relaxing, decresing stress. Makes everybody happier than just worrying and fretting. I highly recommend it!"
3,whats the song called,"what is the name of the song when harold and kumar take those guys truck away and then they listen to the cd that thoses guys had in the car. and the song goes like this ""and i need you now night, and i need more then ever......"""
4,A great soundtrack for a great movie,"This soundtrack is really an excellent representation of the movie. It's funny, and it has almost all the right songs. Sadly, it didn't have ""Let's Get Retarted"" by the Black Eyed Peas... which I really enjoy. Oh well, an otherwise good soundtrack."
2,Highly Polished Plastic Turd,"I read the reviews and bought one anyway, which was my mistake. It was brand new and like the review said the volume cut out completely at low settings. Never mind the possibility of the batteries leaking the sound from this unit is way too bright; meaning it has far too much treble. The button functions also do not make sense. Buy a Logitech Pure-Fi Anywhere (I did) or an Altec Lansing IM9."
2,Marginal,"Overall, this kit is marginal. The mat is OK, the block and strap are both fine.. the DVD is awful.. they go through the poses so quickly... barely giving you time to breath.. I felt rushed and not relaxed at all... after 2 minutes I turned it off. Save your money."
3,Equipment is good but DVD is not for beginners,"I don't have a problem with the equipment but the DVD moves way too fast without any actual instructions as to how to do them. For a beginner they should be showing you how to do the poses, especially in the second work out. If you have never done yoga before you will need a different DVD that is truly for beginners but if you don't have any of the equipment it gives you what you need and for a few dollars less then buying them individually."
3,Good for basics.,"I think that the instructor goes too fast for a ""beginner"". He transitions between everything with little explanation. He doesn't tell you that you are going to transition until he is already in that pose.All in all, I think that this is moves too fast for beginners and doesn't give you enough detail."
3,"Thin mat, but workable...","The mat in this set is really thin. That's our only complaint. We ordered this because my husband is new to yoga and we weren't sure he would like it. With regular mats priced at $40+, this was a great deal. It comes with a block, strap and a yoga DVD.The yoga DVD, while apparently advertised for beginners, leaves a lot to be desired. It was too difficult for my husband, and in my mind too fast-paced and lacking explanation for beginners. I highly recommend getting a different DVD.We found Suzanne Deason's ""Yoga Conditioning for Weight Loss"" a better fit for him being a beginner. Neither of us needed the weight loss portion, but it's a great beginner DVD.The block in here is standard, nothing fancy. And, again, the mat is pretty low quality. It will work, but for the experienced yoga lover, it leaves much to be desired."
3,not bad but not great,the gear is fine...the video is ok but i thought it would be more informative since it is a beginners video.
2,Not what I expected...,"This product was not at all what I expected.-The blocks are fine. No problems there.-The mat is very thin. It's made out of that same non-slip stuff they sell at Wal-mart for putting under rugs. I've been looking at Yoga kits in nearby stores that cost within [the price] of this one and they had higher quality mats at nearly 1.5 inches thick. This mat is about 1/4 inches thick.-The tape is geared more toward stretching than to Yoga. If you're interested in learning Yoga, this tape is not for you.It's all about expectations and given that, I'm seriously considering sending this product back..."
2,Poorly designed,"I bought this for my girlfriend who was wanting to get into Yoga - this kit is pretty crappy for beginners. The instructor just goes from pose to pose, without giving you really any instruction on what you should be focusing on as far as your form (very important in yoga), goes through everything really, really fast; the mat is pretty thin - overall I would not buy another product from Gaiam - it seems slapped together without much thought."
3,Could be better...,"The strap, block, and mat included in this kit are all great. I am happy that I now own these essential yoga props, as I can use them in classes and at home. Unfortunately, to say the DVD was a disappointment is an understatement. It's simply not meant for beginners. The instructor names a pose - be it Triangle Pose, Tree Pose, what have you - and goes quickly, fluidly into it without ANY further explanation! No guidelines for obtaining the proper posture and body alignment were given for any of the poses named. It is dangerous for beginners to attempt yoga without adequate instruction, because doing so could strain or injure the body. I would have preferred to have paid a little less for a ""prop"" kit without a DVD so that I could purchase a true ""beginners"" DVD separately."
2,not worth it,"i bought my kit from target. i was really disappointed. Although it included everything-the mat, the block, the strap and the dvd, they were not incorporated into the actual video, only in the prep/intro portion and not the workout itself. Also the matt did not have the positions or squares as the one rodney lee was using. i did not really find this kit helpful or useful. Even when i tried to incorporate the block and strap and make my personal judgement on the mat portions, i felt that the video was going too fast for me to use the block or the strap correctly and efficently."
3,"Product good, video a little slow.","I only used th video a few times, they were a skill level above where I was, and a little to mystical for me."
5,Everything you need,"It didn't get any wasier than this. Open the box, unwrap the products and you are ready to go. It even included a Rodney Yee DVD to get started with. Everything needed to get you started in one box!"
3,"Easy to clean, easy to store","I bought this along with the Gaiam Super Yoga Mat Wash. The mat is somewhat thin, but sufficient for following along with the included DVD."
3,"Not bad, but index is poor","A good first read on ASP, this book explains the basic object model and structure very well.Sadly, the index is noticably thin, which diminishes the work's very as reference material. On several occasions I simple couldn't find information that I knew I'd read before.This reviewer hasn't read many other books on ASP, but is convinced there's something better out there."
5,My ASP bible!,This book is an excellent reference for the Visual Basic programmer who is moving to ASP/VBScript. Excellent application examples and references. Plus the Wrox Web site provides excellent sample code and support.
5,Must have! Contains plenty of great info!,This is the most comprehensive collection of information on Active Server Pages that I've seen. It contains a lot of practical examples and explains each of them in sufficient detail
5,Best of the best on learning ASP,"As a physician developing an intranet for our medical group and needing an efficient cost effective way to get interactivity between our web pages and our corporate databases(Foxpro,Access,Sybase, and Oracle)...ASP is the fastest and easiest way to do it. As for learning ""ASP"" no other ""ASP"" book comes close to this one in readibility and usefulness. If MD technonerds can do ASP, anyone can! And this book teaches best!"
4,A book worth buying.,"This book must be the best book on ASP available today. Though might not be suitable for those without programming experience, this book gives a strong background and foundation in programming Web application using ASP. I have read some other ASP books but nothing comes close. I highly recommend this book for anyone interested in learning ASP."
5,Complete Guide to ASP,"This book is the one you must have. The book assumes you have previous knowledge of VBScript. However, it is an excellent book both as a study material and as a reference. There are other books I have read on ASP, but none are as detailed as this. Good work Alex. - Manohar Kamath"
2,mixed review,"the kachina dolls and photography were well done and could hardly be improved upon. however, the commentary is terrible; it is replete with errors; so much so that the reader is misled by unreliable information; this book should be withdrawn from the market until the errors have been corrected."
2,Very disappointed.,The pictures in this book were quite good. I would have liked the captions to match the Kachinas. Some of the errors were so blatant that I find it hard to believe the book was proofed.
1,Contemporary Hopi Kachina Dolls (Schiffer Book for Collectors),"A complete waste of money. Riddled with mistakes. Do we really need almost 40 pictures of the eagle katsina? Of no value to collectors. Spend your money elsewhere. There are lots of good katsina books for collectors, but not this one. Zero stars."
4,"""Andeian Bluegrass""",I bought this CD from the group a few years ago in Canada where they were in concert. I love the haunting sound that is like no other music I have. The music is great but the quality of the recording could have been better.
3,Great info but,"I find this book has useful information, but am very disappointed the book's binding fell apart after only 6 months.That makes it difficult to use with the pages falling out."
2,Read the instructions,"I did not read the instructions. I tried to install this thing on Windows XP and it blew away the operating system. I had to do a reinstall of Windows XP to get my computer to work. I love this product, but cannot now use it."
5,oldie but goodie... prompt service.,Most probably don't need/use it anymore but I did need Winfax Pro. Found it quickly and got it easily from this vendor. Thanks.
1,War toys for preschoolers? Please *don't* bring 'em on!,"Our son was given a couple of these for Christmas last year, by family members who don't know us very well. If they did, they'd realize that war toys are on the list of things that we do not want our children to play with... and certainly not before they are old enough to understand what war is *really* all about. I'm sure these are fine adventure toys and all that -- they did seem to be well-made -- but, let's not mince words, they are war toys. I just don't think that's appropriate for kids under at least 8-10 years old."
1,bad,"This product was not delivered to the correct address at first. This was corrected with a lot of effort on my part.After delivery - I noticed that one of the castors was damaged. I notified the sender and requested a new castor, but have never been contacted regarding this issue. I am very dissapointed with this interaction."
1,THey have since changed the title,"This item was originally listed as a Santa suit with beard, hat and glasses. When I recieved it and it was ONLY the beard, hat and glasses I called them and they were not to helpful. Offered for me to return it at my expense for shipping and would still charge me a 20% restocking fee. Restocking fee?? are you kidding me? I will never buy anything from them again. I am glad to see they have since changed the title description. They are snakes. Beware."
3,Quite entertaining!,"Libby is 33 years old and has just had a job change. She's gone from being a bureaucrat in the Canadian Department of Education to being a speech writer for the Minister of the Department of Culture. Her only other claim to fame is the number of bouquets she's caught as weddings. She catches her 13th at the wedding of her friend Emma's wedding, where she meet's Tim.While Libby's excited about her new job, things are going so well. Margo, the Minister's right hand woman doesn't like Lobby and sets about making her life difficult. Libby's parents and family are on Libby's case to settle down, but she's got nada on the romance front.My favorite part of the book is Libby's menagerie of friends. They add much needed humor. It's also really easy to like Libby. Her one line zingers are pretty good. I do think the book could've been a little shorter if some of Margo's shenanigans had been left out. It's a good read."
5,The Last Book You'll Ever Need For Your Journey?,"Everything else nibbles around the edges. ""What is Self?"" reflects the straight path to the gritty ""reality"" of No-Self.That was as much as I wanted to write, but Amazon, in its wisdom, wants more....so here goes:Strip this book of her explications from Christian theology if you like and re-contextualize it in other frames if you must. Ignore the misconceptions you might see her in her interpretations of Jung and Hinduism.These are minor ""flaws"" in a spiritual masterpiece.I have been sorely tempted to give away every other book I have read from luminaries like Sri Ramana Maharshi, Nisargadatta Maharaj, and Jean Kline; not because they are not ""enlightened"" but because their explanations and pointing instructions are swallowed whole and recast with great clarity by ""What is Self""."
2,The price is breaking me,"My mother goes through a lot of these in a short while, and I don't want her to suffer, or have her comfort compromised with a less comfortable product. That said; I have no money trees in my yard, so with a heavy heart, I'll likely have to go to a different affordable product...of necessity. I'm starting to carry a credit card balance, due to the volume she needs, and the high price of this product."
1,Major Price Increased 43% - Careful,"These Prevails available through Subscribe & Save have increased in price from $36 to $51.41, however the email notice of upcoming shipments list the old price of $36. ouch! 43% price increase!!!"
3,Bulky,"This protection is very large. It absorbs more than other types, but the size is large and bulky around the legs. When I reorder I will get the smaller size. The absorbtion is good."
2,"Product great...but watch the price go up, down, up!",Prevails is a good product. But Amazon's pricing fluctuates greatly! Have to watch the prices especially when on Subscribe and Save.
5,INFLATION?,"These diapers were a God-send since they fit so well and arrived on a recurring basis at my father's front door. HOWEVER, can someone tell me why such a dramatic price increase? I was paying a total of $61.20 (after discount, etc.) and now I'm being billed $85.68 (after discount, etc.) - that is a 22 cent per diaper increase almost overnight. I love the product but I don't understand the dramatic sudden price increase."
5,Prevail Underwear,Bought these for my mother. She prefers this brand over others she has tried previously. Would recommend you try them.
3,Didn't receive what I ordered,"This is the third time that I have ordered this product; to order I just went to a past order and clicked on it. What I received was not a pull-up as both previous orders have been but a wrap around like a diaper. I was disappointed with the fit and feel of them but due to the need I didn't have time to send them back. They will do but are not comfortable nor ""discreet"" due to the tabs that barely hold."
1,NOT Extra Absorbent,These underwear are very thin. They are not extra absorbent! After buying these I realize I prefer Depends! WARNING: Buy only if you don't need much absorbancy!
2,Prevail Pads,I like this product very much. I have told several friends about them. I use them every day. They keep me dry all day.
2,Quality varies by reseller.,The product is generally a good product. The recent batch I received from RWS looked to be repacks or 2nds.
3,"Adequate photos, disappointing durability","This camera performed well for about three months of daily use, and then started having trouble connecting to the phone. You can't leave it plugged in all the time because it drains the phone's battery, you cannot recharge while it is plugged in, and you cannot use the headset while it's plugged in. That means, you are plugging it in and taking it out a lot, so the opportunity for damage is plentiful. Make sure you fill out your warranty card and keep it somewhere close to hand."
1,Terrible!,"I am very dissapointed!The pieces look used and rusty and two of them are scratched. Also, they doesn't specify the size of the piece, and are so big than are dificult to fit in any place.If I could download pictures of the items, you could see how bad they are! (don't deserve any star)"
4,quite a mixture,"I bought this CD because I wanted a recording of Liadov's ""Enchanted Lake."" The performance of this piece is very nice, although the sound is a bit old-fashioned. The performance of Grieg's ""Last Spring"" is very beautiful, indeed. However, I had hoped for more music on this CD, as there is only 66 minutes. The other pieces on this CD are rarely-heard pieces that are quite pleasant, except for the atonal ""Birds of Paradise,"" which is a typical 1960's atonal piece. It can hardly be categorized as ""quiet listening""! I erased this piece when copying the CD to my computer. In general, this is a strange mixture of music, but nice performances all around."
1,Difficult even for an adult,"Ths was reviewed in the Orlando Sentinel 1/1/04. The chocolate chips have to heat for 8 minutes, then wait 3 1/2 minutes before squeezing the chocolate into molds. It is then refrigerated for 15 minutes.The reviewer found it hard to squeeze the chocolate into the molds and even after 15 min. in the refrigerator, the chocolate wasn't firm enough. Wrapping the Kiss made a mess and the chocolate sticks to the pushing tool. The finished product did not look like a chocolate kiss and the whole procedure took 30 minutes.To use it you need a funnel, chocolate chips, and 8 AA batteries."
1,A Complete Waste of Time,"I agree with the majority of the other reviewers. This toy is a waste of time and Hershey should be suing the manufacturer for use of their name. The amount of time it takes to make FOUR Hershey kisses is ridiculous. Over half an hour. And it's just not that much fun. Squirting the chocolate in was perhaps the best part, and that wasn't so much fun.Also, you get four pieces of tin foil to wrap the kisses and four Hershey Kiss little pull strings. Unbelievable! They can't cost that much that they couldn't put in a bigger supply than that. There are instructions on how to create your own little blue pull string. You cut paper very, very thinly and then write ""Hershey Kiss"" in blue. Really.My kids enjoy practically everything. They are hugely uncomplicated. And they were very sad about this toy. It wasn't worth the time and effort you need to put into it to get four kisses. Even if this toy is free, do not buy it."
1,junk!,Don't waste your money. It doesn't work. You need a screw driver to clean it when your done. You have to take it apart. The process is long and the results are disappointing.
1,absolute disappointment worst toy ever!,"My daughter wanted one of these things so we gave it to her for Christmas and it turned out to be a huge disappointment! We followed the complex steps to make kisses that never did form completely. Then we attempted to wrap the ""kisses"" we made which turned out to be impossible! The wrapping machine just does not work at all. This toy is way to complex (even if it did manage to work which it doesn't) I have three children and have seen many toys come and go but this one has to be the worst! I would rather give my child a rubber ball and some string than I would this piece of junk!"
1,JUST BUY KISSES ALREADY MADE,"this was a waste of money and time. the instructions say to use hershy milk chocolate chips and when you do, they just dont taste the same...when i bought this as a christmas present i purposely did not buy any hershey kisses for stocking stuffers because i was going to make them with this...and 4 kisses is all you get every 15 minutes...i gave up and just let the kids eat the chocolate chips because it was too time consuming"
1,Worst experience with a toy (& its manufacturer) all year,This toy did not work when we received it. The box said not to return to the retailer and to contact the manufacturer instead if parts were broken or not working. I contacted the manufacturer and was instructed by a customer service representative to mail them the broken piece along with the UPC barcode cut off of the box. I followed the representative's directions but never received a replacement part. Very disappointing.
1,JUNK JUNK AND MORE JUNK,After several sets of batteries the damn thing still does not work. I have a disappointed child here.
1,BARBIE MP3,DO NOT PURCHASE THIS ITEM. This MP3 player does not work. I have tried to download the music on it all day. A Christmas present that my daughter was very eager to use and it just will NOT work. I have tried to sync the music and it appears to download but when we try to access it on the MP3 player it does not appear and we are unable to play it.
1,Waste of $$,Very disaappointing. It wouldn't charge fully then died after being used once. Looks pretty but it's a piece of garbage that I regret buying.
1,Doesn't Download,THIS DIDN'T WORK FOR ME on Christmas Day like it said. It didn't hold a charge and it didn't take the music. I have a Mac with itunes and it is supposed to work. I mailed it back. I stayed on hold with customer service and they were no help. Looks great and looks like fun but it wouldn't work.
2,NOT A GOOD LONG TERM CHAIR,"I WOULD NOT RECOMEND THIS CHAIR FOR LONG TERM OR HEAVY USERS. WHILE I WILL SAY THIS IS A NICE CHAIR UNTIL YOU NEED TO MAKE CHANGES OR THINGS START TO BREAK OR NEED REPLACEMENT. FIRST OFF EVERYTHING ON THIS CHAIR IS METRIC, SCREWS, BOLTS, AND BEARINGS, SO NOTHING IS INTERCHANGEABLE. THE ONLY PLACE YOU CAN BUY PARTS IS MEDLINE, NO ONLINE ORDERING OR PRICE SHEETS. IF YOU WANT PNEUMATIC TIRES, IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN WITH MEDLINE. THE SEAT STAYS (THE PART INSIDE THE SEAT UPHOLSTRY THAT HOLDS THE SEAT STRAIT) ARE PLASTIC, SO WHEN YOUR SEAT STARTS TO FOLD IN ON YOU, YOU'LL KNOW WHAT THE PROBLEM IS. IN 16 YEARS I'VE NEVER SEEN PLASTIC IN PLACE OF STEEL. I WOULD STRONGLY SUGGEST YOU TAKE A LOOK AT BREEZY OR INVACARE BEFORE YOU BUY A CHAIR FOR LONG TERM USEAGE. I WISH I HAD."
5,Felt I could use a digital copy of a personal research I had previously finished. jg,Dear Sirs: I received undamaged and was exactly the item I ordered. I am satisfied with the experience. You may not understand that I am happy. jg
5,Unexpected humor,"This book added greatly to my knowledge of our language's history. Also, a real surprise was the humor that the author put in the book. I certainly did not expect ANY associated with this subject."
3,wrong color,"Was very pleased with the construction of the hat, good quality, but the picture shows it in light blue on the computer. It came in tan. I have a light blue shirt that I thought it would go well with and there is no choose on color. The delivery time was excellent DSmitti"
2,His own worst enemy,"Chester Himes, the main character in this book (based on a real life author who wrote about serving time), is caught with a concealed weapon and is sent to jail. While the author goes to great lengths to point out the racial injustice in the penal system the main problem is this man's own behavior. Actually this book shows that crime doesn't pay. In a sense the main character got what he deserved, he killed his wife and got away with it but wound up spending the rest of his life in jail anyway.I'm not as convinced as some of the other reviewers that this book demonstrates the injustice of the penal system or is a ""typical black man's experience"". It does demonstrate that what comes around goes around. Chester Himes got what was coming to him."
5,One if the best,"This book may have started the famous PR bonds. For thoes that are not aware. The bond allows a person to be freed from jail with out having to pay bail if it is their first offense. The court is not obligated to give you this bond, but in many cases it is offered to allow poor folk an opportunity to be freed until their court date. In this novel Donald attacked the penal system. Took it apart and exposed all of it's dark, evil component. A must read no questions asked."
5,"Now, THIS Is What I Have Been Missing!","Several years ago, we had a station here in Dallas - The Oasis Smooth Jazz. I loved that station and listened to it all day long. Apparently, I was the only one as they removed the station! I have resorted to finding my jazz through various CDs and artists - some finds have been great, and some, not so great. This CD however, is exactly what I have been missing! The music is soothing, sensual and relaxing. Reminds me of the station that I so enjoyed listening to years ago. Very happy with this particular purchase - only wish I could find more just like this one!"
5,Great Jazz,"What a wonderful way to relax!! This CD is for anyone who enjoys and appreciates a good, mellow, sound."
4,Great deal - but not the strongest,"I got this 50 yard roll from Amazon for about what I paid for a 10 yard roll at the local home improvement store. Definitely a great deal. It is very pliable, extremely sticky, and works great. I took one star off because it is not as strong as that other roll. If you are forming it around corners or uneven seams, this roll is far more prone to ripping, even if the sheet metal isn't sharp. I just had to make a bunch of small patches to cover areas where it ripped."
3,Ok,A little difficult to use. Doesn't tear in a straight line. I have used other foil tapes that performed better.
4,YOu need this for heating pipes,Used this to seal the insulation on my copper heating pipes. This is the stuff you need and 50 yards here cost less then the smaller roll at HD
1,"Poor Quality, arrived damaged",I received this item with holes in it -- also the screen was detaching from the outside rim. BAD quality... would not recommend. Spend more money on a better splatter screen.
3,Poor quality:,This spatter screen arrived with a hole in it and it was too thin to repair. Since it was a very inexpensive item I just decided to keep it.
2,Biagio's Capitano,"Normally I like the music of Antonacci however on this one called Sono Cose Que Capitano I found it to be a little to ""clubby"" sounding. Most of his latest music appeals to both young and old. This one will have more of an appeal to the over 25 year old crowd. There was no single song that we will be singing in years to come. ""Mi fai stare bene"" from the cd of the same name will be sung by all ages."
3,Just the beggining,"One of the firsts of Biagio, and not as good as the next ones. In this CD the singer still doesn't dare to experiment the impact of his music, and it flows a little bit monotonous. It's a average CD if you like italian music."
5,Underwater Origami,"Nice book. I also bought ""Origami Adventures: Animals"" and ""Origami Adventures: Dinosaurs"". I am happy with all three, though I kind of like the ""Dinosaurs"" and ""Animals"" a little better. They were the same price, but came as hardback books and were spiral bound. They also came with papers that were specifically for each creature being created (with ""skin"" or ""fur"" patterns, eyes, etc). Underwater Origami is paperback and comes with solid color papers with no designs, so it is not quite as creative as the ""Animals"" and ""Dinosaurs"", but I would still recommend it and I am still very happy I bought. If looking to buy more than one book, I would recommend getting all three. Underwater Origami has nice pictures and is colorful and makes a nice gift."
3,Underwater Origami,"The book does make some cute things, but it is cheaply made and fell apart the first day I got it."
5,Fantastic read for anyone interested in Chaucer's women,"I used this book for a lengthy paper on the representations of women in the Canterbury Tales and it really sticks in my mind. It was informative, intelligent, and easy to read. Fantastic book!"
3,"OK, but there's better around","I was slightly disappointed listening to this CD, after listening to Gatecrasher black I expected more. The tracks are ok if you're into deep house/ epic trance music, and there are some very nice vocal/trancey bits, but IMO theyre not mixed well together and the whole thing just doesnt flow. Try Oakenfold's 'Resident', Sasha and Digweeds 'Northern Exposure - Expeditions' for some top quality stuff."
5,The Best Gatecrasher!,"I own all four Gatecrashers - Black, Red, Wet and Disko Tech - and this is far and away the best. Probably the best cd I have ever bought. At first I was hesitant about the $ but you will not be dissapointed. I recommend playing this cd in an altered state of consciousness to really appreciate it's power. YOu will play the cd the look at the clock and realize it's two hours later and you will do this over and over. I've had the cd for a year and I still do it. This cd recommendation is the strongest I've ever felt. Do me and yourself a favor - bypass any doubt in your mind and make the purchase. Please - you wont regret it ! I PROMISE!"
5,The start for me,"This album started me into trance music, and serves as a constant reminder of what all music mixes should be. I started out liking ""plasma,"" but as my tastes evolved, I liked ""future"" more and more. I still listen to this set endlessly, as it really gets at your emotions like good music should."
2,Different Album?,"I bought this album thinking I was getting all 40 tracks like it showed, but when I recieved my copy I got the one with fewer tracks (and none of the good songs). I'm still looking for the european version. Don't get this album unless its the european version!"
3,Revenge In Tascosa,"If the person from Boulder Co. is such a wonderful editor, he or she, would have found out that LIGHT HOUSE PRESS is NOT a vanity publisher. And friend, I happen to like commas, they let people like yourself, write a review that sells thousands of my novels. It makes the much researched novel better reading.Thank you for your review and have Happy New Year."
1,Sloppy writing means you won't get past the first page!,"This is not good writing and it has never (as far as I can tell) been edited. God only knows why I'm bothering to review it. Just three sentences in you get the following gem: ""President Hayes, sent Shorty a wire, that had to be delivered by the Butterfield Stage Lines, telling him to head for Tascosa, and round up some rustlers and land grabbers."" WILL YOU JUST GIVE THE COMMA KEY A REST, BUDDY???There's definitely a place in the world for vanity publications. But don't look here for it. Sorry Paul."
5,good buy,"I have ordered this pot once before from another company only to break it again while washing it. The lid gets stuck inside the pot and when I pulled it out I broke the pot. This pot seems to be thicker than the last one I ordered. Still, handle with care and don't get the lid stuck inside!"
2,As fragile as a celebrities ego,"While I liked the style of this product, there is no doubt that it breaks extremely easily. Unfortunately that is one of the flaws of the Braun carafe and probably why Braun has discontinued making the coffee maker which utilizes this carafe."
4,Braun FalvorSelect 12-Cup Replacement Carafe,How does one rate a replacement coffee carafe? It's great! My only complaint is that the lid was probably put in the dishwasher and is now slightly warped...but it still works. I wash it by hand now for fear it might melt! :)
3,Almost Perfect Carafe,"I love the carafe and the ability to sneak a cup before a pot is fully brewed. My biggest problem is with the design of the plastic spill guard piece. It is held in place by small plastic ""nibs"" on both sides. And my expereience is that one of those nibs breaks off after about 2-3 years. The result is that every time I lift the lid, the spill guard piece flls into a carafe of hot coffee. The coffee maker continues to work fine."
5,Coffee Carafe Replacement,The carafe was slightly redesigned from the original that was broken. The redesign made the water pouring easier as the spout is a bit wider. We are very happy with it and much cheaper than throwing out the coffe maker for a new one (which was the only option in the stores).
3,Not as thick as the original,"This replacement carafe does the job fine, but I find myself replacing it way too often because of it's thinner glass so it chips much easier than the original."
3,At least it's cheap . . .,"The coffee maker is great - shame the glass carafe is so thin. We don't break many things in the kitchen, but we've gone through 4 or more of these replacements in the last several years. At least they're cheap - I just order 2 at a time . . .UPDATE 2009: when the price on these carafes doubled, we bought a different coffee maker."
2,Ridiculously fragile,"These things break so easily! I think I'm on my 3rd replacement carafe. I like the coffee maker itself, but at some point I'm going to have to replace it just to get one with a sturdier carafe. Braun's carafes are as delicate as eggshells."
3,haven't broken it yet,This is my 5th caraf for this coffee maker.I really like the machine but the glass carafe is very thin.So far I haven't broken this one after a month.
2,Glass to thin,"The braun coffee maker is very good,but the decanter is so thin it brakes even when you wash it. I am on my second one, and mayby the last."
2,Braun KFK12FL 12-Cup Coffee Maker,"I am an avid lover of good coffee and the Braun coffee maker is one of the best machines we've ever owned for the initial cash outlay. However, there is one serious problem with this device and that is the quality of the carafe. It's made from almost paper thin glass and the slightest little bump in the wrong area will create a glass fracture which envariably leaks from then on. And the replacement is so very expensive which leads me to think the Braun Company is in the business primarily to profit from their after market sales of carafes. Sorry to tell you this ""Mr Braun Company,"" I'll never purchase another one of your carafes."
1,Love the coffee maker- Hate the CARAFE,"My husband and I thoroughly enjoy the coffee made by the maker, but dread handling the carafe. We are now looking for our third replacement carafe. The glass seems to be extremely fragile and any bump on the sink edge or extra pressure around the handle causes it to crack or shatter. I have gone to three stores looking for the replacement and one on-line site and still have not found one!!"
1,You all were right about this one.,I dropped the original carfe last week because I have no motor skills to speak of. It lasted almost 3 years. This replacement lasted less than a week. It broke while I was washing it with a sponge. I'm buying a different brand of coffee maker tomorrow rather than padding Braun's pockets by buying another one of these things.
1,Cracks easier than an eggshell,I absolutely love my Braun KF187 coffeemaker but the carafe breaks every 6 months or so. I have tried all types of coffeemakers but always come back to my KF187. Can Braun please make a better carafe??? Looking at all the reviews on the site it seems to be the common problem!Braun are you listening?
2,ARGH! I POPPED ANOTHER CARAFE!,"I have and do love my Braun Flavor Select coffee machine. HOWEVER! The carafes POP with the simplest brush against the inside of my sink when washing. This will be my attempt at a 5th purchase of a new carafe. Theyre hard to find in stock anywhere, and not exactly at a disposable cost. WHERE CAN THEY BE FOUND AFFORDABLE SO I CAN STOCK MY SHELVES!?"
2,IT'S VERY FRAGILE!,I washed it and it broke in my hand. I now am writing this with 10 stitches in my hand.
2,Carafe problems,I love the coffeemaker but hate the carafe. I've had the machine for about 1 1/2 years and am on my 3rd or 4th carafe. They break extremely easily. Also be careful because the lids fit inside the carafes but they do not come out! (that's how I broke my last one).
4,It's made of glass. Treat it such!!,"We've had the Braun for several years now. Like it so much that we bought one for my parents 2 years ago. They are still on their first carafe; we our on our second. Ours has fallen off the top of the piled high drying rack several times and bounced on the linoleum floor, surviving all except the final fall. Yes it did break. I've broken drinking glasses that have fallen the same height. With a little care, this carafe should last you. Ours has been through the dishwasher umpteen times as well as just been rinsed out and set by the sink on the rack with no ill effect.The one drawback: this carafe is hard to find and expensive. If it makes anyone feel any better, I just priced out new Braun coffee makers and they've gone up in price about $15. They all seem to have a little digital clock on the front now. This makes the replacement carafe a little more in line with the maker price."
1,....And I thought it was just me!!,After reading these reviews....I realize it just might not be me after all. I thought I was being careless because I'm searching for my 4th replacement pot now. Every little ding and there goes my pot. And its not scratch resistant either.
1,4'th Carafe in ONE YEAR!,This carafe is so fragile. This is the 4'th one I am ordering in a year. That is crazy. The cost of the replacment coffee pots is up to the cost of the actual coffee maker at this point. At what point do we decide to throw away the coffee maker and just get a new one with a TOUGHER carafe? I am wondering....
1,Carafe makes this not a good buy,"I cannot believe that Braun still sells coffee makers after this debacle. Carafe's break extremely easily. Let me say that again, extremely easily. Anyone who says differently, works for Braun! Since Braun is owned by Gillette, it is obvious, they tried to make the razor marketing model work for coffee makers...lose money on the initial purchase of the coffee maker, and make it up in replacement carafes.I will steer away from all Braun products in the future.Good decision marketeers!"
3,Fragile pot,"The glass is very fragile on these pots. You definitely need to be careful washing them. But the coffeemakers are so great you have to live with it. Otherwise, I like the design of the pot and the easily removable lid. Just handle with caare."
3,Braun KFK12FL FlavorSelect 12-Cup Replacement Carafe,"This carafe is the only carafe that will operate properly with the Braun Flavorselect coffee maker due to unique design of no-drip, auto-cutoff feature of coffee filter basket. I tried several universal/adjustable carafes, which did not allow coffee maker drip filter to work normally. On the plus side it is attractive, clear glass and dishwasher safe. However, it is not shatter proof or resistant. Mine broke easily with minor bumps into faucet or counter-top. That's why I bought two carafes the second time, since the model is unique and not available in my local stores."
1,Poor quality carafe,"This replacement carafe cracked after 3 months. The orginal carafe had thicker glass and lasted greater than four years. The coffee maker itself creates very repeatable good coffee. I am buying one more replacement carafe and if it breaks, I will buy a different brand of coffee maker. Someone at Braun saved a little too much money on the carafe at the expense of reliability."
2,Great appliance....need closet full of carafes.,"... The appliance itself is great. I've had my Braun for about 6 years now and it hasn't even hinted of breaking down on me. The timer still works faithfully after all these years and I wake up to fresh coffee every morning. NOW...... As for the carafes...I've gone through 2 and still haven't replaced the third one I broke a few weeks ago. Not just any replacement carafe will fit...the Braun engineer$ made $ure of that. You must buy the $pecial carafe made for the FlavorSelect model. At this time..I have a saucepan catching my coffee, until I find a replacement carafe locally. I've been checking here...but Amazon doesn't seem to be in a rush to restock."
4,Braun replacement carafe,"The original carafe that came with my coffee maker was very thin and fragile. Thus, when I ordered the replacement, I expected the same of it; however, I was very pleasantly surprised that this carafe is far thicker and more robust than the original."
2,Wrong color!,I carefully ordered the black version for $5.00 more so it would match mycoffee maker; after waiting far too long for it to be delivered I find theyhave sent me a grey one!Can no one do anything right anymore? I will contact them tomorrow andsee what they have to say - another week without coffee at least...
1,not a bargain and don't wait...,go to smartshopper.com and buy it for 9.99 and 6.95 shipping... what do you mean available and not in stock?
1,"Great, but can't find a 12 cup coffee maker now!!",First the carafe breaks so I buy the new carafe only to have the coffee maker break and now I can't find a new 12 cup coffee maker. What a waste of money!!! All the sell are the 10 cup coffee makers.
4,Good Cargo Bar,"Good Cargo Bar. Doesn't get excessively tight in my truck (thus the 4 stars). Good construction, use it as a cargo separator under my tonneau cover."
4,Great for the price,"definitely worth the price. just need to learn to use it efficiently in the beginning and it works great ! recommend it for the price, does the job but takes just a bit to learn the ropes with the little ratchet release."
3,Functional,I received the order promptly but the ratcheting device did not function as well as I had expected. It has worked well since being put in place.
3,Cargo bar,The ratchet part works great. The only con I have is the rubber pads on the ends are too hard and you just can't that last click to get it tight enough to stay in place.
4,BIG Help,"It's a little bit on the flimsy side, but I does section your truck bed out to help keep your groceries from not rolling around back there. I wouldn't really use it to support anything heavy but to keep stuff from rolling around, it's great!."
5,Great Product,Just what I was looking for. I wanted a strong ratchet type bar and this is exactly it. Would buy again!
1,Ratchet Slips,"I was buying for my jeep cherokee for when I lower the back seat for storage.When I went to tighten then ratchet down to lock, the bar would buckle a bit and jump a detent on the ratchet bar.Which would in my opinon make this system useless for my needs. (No staying-put power)I will try the twist type system next.Keeper 05059 Ratcheting Cargo BarSorry Will S.New Hampshire"
1,Junk!,"I bought this, and it will not stay where I put it, and Im only out about a foot, keeps ""popping"" out! Thank God for Amazon return policy!"
2,Not very sturdy,"I just received 2 ratcheting cargo bars and I am just as quickly returning them back to Amazon. The product was literally ""Made in Taiwan"", need I say more? It is flimsy when extended to fit a regular size truck bed (F-150 crew). The ratcheting mechanism does not stay securely even when the ratchet is locked. I would not trust this cargo bar for any cargo in my truck bed. I was looking for a sturdy, quality made cargo restraint bar and this is not it."
1,Doesn't do the job,I bought this item to keep things from rattling around in the back of my F350. The ratcheting mechanism slips when it is torqued enough to stay in place. I would recommend trying a different cargo bar.
3,It works as advertised,"I'm fairly pleased with this cargo bar. It works as intended - one thing I didn't think about and am not sure if other bars do this... Sideways movement - yes it held my cargo up against the wall of the truck bed but, the box slid from side to side - I didn't think to angle it or anything. Angling probably would fix that - some bars probably have a cross bar for this - something to think about. Also - don't get your fingers pinched in the ratcheting mechanism - I can easily see that happening..."
3,Barely adequate,"When extended to the width of a full-size bed, the bar's strength is greatly reduced. The ratcheting mechanism is very rough and requires some sort of ritual sacrifice in order to make it work properly. I do not recommend this cargo bar."
2,not practical,"i tok this item to my SUV, its defict the plastic internal.i geass its good for truck only because its metel internal."
5,very handy item to have,I`ve owned cargo bars in the past but they were threaded and difficult to extend constently. This is the first ratcheting cargo bar that I have had and I recomend it highly very easy to adjust and the ratchet action makes it very easy to use.
5,Survived Death Valley,I bought this cargo bar in a hurry to keep our coolers and gas cans in place during our 800 mile death valley off road adventure. Just as I expected it held in place the entire trip and it got abused. Lots of bumps and jumps and still works like a champ. I would highly recommend this to anybody.
3,"Decent enough, but untested.","Just received it for Christmas. Seems like it will do the job, but when I extended it in my F150, it felt real flimsy at the ratchet point. I'll have to give it a good try to see if it's sturdy enough to hold a load without sliding around, but I'm not sure. Compared to one my dad has in his Tundra, this one feels weak."
1,complete junk!,This product is trash. it might work in a mini truck to keep shopping bags in place but thats about it. I have a full size truck and when the bar is extended to fit the truck bed it is flimzy and weak the ratchet is also a weak point. the bar would never hold back any type of weight in a full size truck.
5,Heiress The Story of Christina Onassis,Very good book i recommend it to who ever follow the family it is a good book it gives good detail into Christina Life. It makes you happy and sad to here she expired so young. I will be getting the next book on her Beautiful Baby Girl When it comes out.
1,"Back to the drawing table, Chapter 2","Read the review entitled ""Back to the Drawing Table"" before considering a purchase. It is a perfectly composed assessment of this toy. My six year old son was so disappointed with the fact that this toy didn't work as advertised, that I am using it as a tool to continue to teach him that not everything works as you see it on the commercial. I just wish I had seen the review before I purchased it. One saving grace was that it is the first Hot Wheels set that assembled in a snap. Big deal, as it doesn't work very well after the assembly. I would not recommend purchasing this toy."
5,Great Toy,"I bought this for my 3yr old son who went crazy over it on TV. It is great. He loves it and with a little parental supervision (only at first) he got the hang of it. No batteries and the trucks work great. I thought the way he was ""reving"" it up, it would not last... but they have. All of the trucks are great (you can buy extra w/ 2or so more in a pack) and they have been through alot with all three boys playing w/ them. My 12 and 6 yr old loved it too. Really cool toy!"
1,Too short,"I odered this belt on Amazon.com and found it is about 10mm short, could not get it on. Checked Ebay, says the belt does not fit my 2005 corvette, Amazon says it does - NOT."
1,nothing new here,"Lose weight, stop smoking, drinking, coffee, become a veggie, yadda yadda. Nothing interesting or new here. I wish I hadn't wasted the money."
4,Grocery Getter,This VW was purchased for my daughter when she was too young to drive it. At 1 yr she was afraid of the electric engine noise. At 2 she could push the pedal but did not understand to keep her foot down and she had not enough strength to turn the wheel. At 3 years she was ready to drive! It has been reliable and durable. The batteries are still good after all this time but I have kept up on keeping them charged throughout the year even when not in use. This car is one-wheel drive and therefore does not go on anything except for carpet and perfectly level pavement. Does not go in grass or gravel at all.
2,Lemon of a toy,"I bought this ride on toy for my 3 year old daughter since she enjoyed her older sisters' jeep, I thought it would be fun for her to have her own. It worked for about a week and then never worked right after that. I bought new batteries for it, but nothing worked. It does not run very fast, if at all. It would go and then stop, needless to say my daughter will not even go in the car now. Maybe I just got a lemon car, but I was very disappointed in this product and would not waste the money on another one like it."
3,descriptiom,the description did not say anything about the size of the squares or if it will take a normal box of brownies or not. If it I I would not have bought
3,Who wants mini popovers?,"Didn't realize this was the 'mini' version until we received it - whoops. We never did get a batch of these to turn out right, but who wants mini popovers anyways? Part of the appeal is how big and fluffy popovers get, so not really sure why this is even made. Anyways, one of the cups was detached when we received the pan, so we contacted amazon and they said to keep it and they'll just refund it. Works for me - kudos to Amazon."
2,Works well but sharp edges,After using it for the first time I immediately for cut buy the edges of the cups. Watch out they are really sharp. Maybe just a defect but still be careful.
3,"pans great, no instructions","My husband and I love popovers and I had looked for a pan everywhere exept online. I was glad to find this online. This pan is great although it came with no instructions. Now, popovers are rather easy to make but I thought maybe this would come with something at least some different recipes. Nothing. Rather disappointing."
3,One of two products with similar problems,"I bought 2 products which I thought were complementary. Mini and full-sized popover pans. This one gets a point higher for being honest.Metal cookware should be able to withstand some abuse. A bump within a dishwasher shouldn't seperate a popover cup from its frame. Therein lies the failure of this product and that of its competitor. Sure, it's simple enough to stamp out the cups and spot-weld them to a frame. But it should be just as easy to make sure it's a weld that doesn't break under normal usage. Had the welds held, I'd have given this a 5-star rating. As it is, you can make your popovers in tea cups on a tray for zero cost or find a better built product."
1,Don't buy this pan,"Better to purchase a pan that is not coated. After about 12 uses, the coating is pulling off the bottom of the cups (and ending up in the pop-overs!).It works OK for actually making popovers, but did not come with a recipe as advertised. Fortunately, it is easy to find a good recipe.Buy a steel pan that is not coated, if you can find one."
4,very good product,"I made the popover's according to directions, they were awesomethey bakedNorpro Nonstick 12 Mini Linking Popover Panand came out of the pan without sticking.I boughtpan's for my sister and she also has great sucess with them."
3,"Makes great popovers, but quality is not good","One of the popover cups broke off when I was washing this pan before I used it the first time. The cup is supposed to be welded to the metal crossbars, but popped off when very little pressure was being applied.I did make popovers using a recipe from a Betty Crocker cookbook and they turned out well.I think this is a good pan to use for popovers and I probably just got a lemon. Good luck."
1,song listing? where is it?,"How can someone list a CD with no listing of the songs? Why would anybody want to buy what looks like a nice package of 40s songs with NO idea of what is on the CD?Further it says a ""three cd set"" on the jacket? Not likely at these prices?Please?"
3,Good doorbell button but poor construction,I purchased two different doorbell buttons both of which would work with my existing wireless bells. They work but unfortunately have the same problem my original doorbells had in that the battery is not secure in a flimsy socket and dislodges continually from ringing pressure.
2,Switch Quit Working,"I bought a wireless doorbell system that uses this button switch when I bought my house three years ago. It is under a covered porch, so it doesn't get wet. We rarely have visitors that use the doorbell, so it was quite a shock to me that when I tested it, it wouldn't work. I replaced the batteries in the chime unit and the button unit, still nothing. Since I know a little bit about electronics, I removed the circuit board from the button unit and used a meter to find out which leads on the switch were used to activate the transmitter. When I shorted out those leads with a pair of tweezers, the doorbell rang. So it is definitely a bad switch. I agree with the opinion that this button unit is poorly designed. I'm not happy that it went bad in such a short time and with so little use, but I am going to buy a new button unit rather than spend a lot more to buy a whole new doorbell system."
4,Hardcore old school punk,"Rosemary's baby features the Misfits guitar player prior to being in the Misfits. Rosemary's Baby is early 80's English hardcore punk. If you like Rudimentary Peni, Crass than you'll like Rosemary's Babies."
5,LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!,This was a great book! Erin Hunter is a very talented author! I can not wait to read the rest of the Warriors books!!
5,Firepaw becomes Fireheart,"Firepaw grows and begins the struggle to cathood. He struggles with his past and with gaining respect in the Thunderclan. Of course, this struggle brings about a lot of drama, but this story is as good as ever. The story ends with a more mature Fireheart."
5,A-MAZING,This book was amazing. When I started reading it I couldn't put it down!!!! :-) I love this book!!!! Awesome
4,"Great, Great, Great!!!","In this book by Erin Hunter, Firepaw becomes Fireheart and he learns that not everything is how it appears."
5,Great book,Great book. They just give me ideas to make books. I think it deserves 5 stars. She is a good author.
5,GREAT,"THIS IS THE BEST BOOK IN THE WORLD. I LIKED THE PART WHERE FIREHART ALMOST KILLED SILVERSREAM BECAUSE GRAYSTRIPE WOULD STOP SEEING HER, BUT TO MAKE GRAYSTRIPE HAPPY."
5,Another excellent instalment,"Fans of the first Warriors, Into the Wild, will be welcomed back into the world of cat clans with a feeling of coming home. Erin Hunter has handled the progression into a sequel very nicely, keeping the same feel of the first story with the natural progression asked of a follow-up. The main feline character, Firepaw, has now become a warrior and earned the name Fireheart, and readers will share his triumph along with him. Windclan, one of the four clans of the forest, has gone missing, and Fireheart and his best friend Graystripe are dispatched to find and bring them back. Tensions are starting to mount between the remaining clans - Riverclan and Shadowclan see Windclan's departure as an opportunity to extend their hunting grounds. Fireheart is starting to grow suspicious of his clan's deputy, Tigerclaw, while Graystripe is making an unlikely friend... Once again, Erin has created an engaging and action-packed tale that is beautifully planned and written."
1,Dissapointing,"I don't read this book untill after I read the 1st,the 3rd,the 5th,and the 6th.I liked the 4th book.But all I have say about Fire and Ice is that it was boring."
5,Awesome!!!!!,"I love the Warriors books, this one is really good because there's more of a plot than some of the others. It's also important to the overall series and introduces as well as hints some things that happen later on. A MUST read."
4,Good book but not the best,"Fireheart and Graystripe are now warriors. Its pretty cool. This book was great the first time I read it, but after I read all of the others i thought that this was the worst book in the series. Still, you should read it, because you wont be able to follow forest of secrets without reading it."
3,Not so good,"Yes, Fireheart and Graystripe went to rescue WindClan! It wouldn't have been so bad if wasn't so BORING. This book sucks. It deserves no further comments.Amberstar.(JAYFEATHERS AWESOME!!!!!!!!!)"
5,The Best,This book was much better than I thought it would be. It is the best book I have read on the kindle fire yet. YOU SHOULD buy this book.
5,A NEW SERIES IS COMING OUT!!!,HOS BOOK OS AWESOME. THE NEW SERIES IS CLLED DAWN OF THE CLANS. THE FIRST BOOK OS CALLED THE SUN TRAIL. IT COMES OUT ON MARCH FOURTH 2013!THANK YOU ERINFIRECLAW
5,Wonderful story,I just love this story! Great animal adventure and excitement for the younger readers and a story that is in alot of ways like human relationships for the older readers. I am an avid reader and I really enjoyed this book. I recommend it to anyone that enjoys a heartwarming tail!!!!
