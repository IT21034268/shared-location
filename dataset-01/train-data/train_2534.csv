3,okay,this cost about $9 and then i had to pay a $10 shipping fee. not very satisfied with that so that's why the reviews are so low.
3,XtremeMac SportWrap iPod Mini Armband,"The hole for the plug in cord is too small for my earbuds, so it is difficult to get a complete, snug connection. Otherwise, the armband works good and is comfortable."
5,It was right on with the movie,"After seeing the movie I couldn't wait for the book to come out. I got it the first day of November and read it in like one day. I am now reading it again and picking up more then I did before, not because I read to fast but because you just do. If you are a fan of the movie and want a little behind the story look then get this screenplay (book)."
5,New Catholic Answer Bible: Revised New American Bible,"New Catholic Answer Bible: Revised New American BibleThis is an excellent resource for Catechist, Bible instructors, students, and especially for the participants in the R.C.I.A. process. I cannot tell you how many people have asked me where I bought this book. Of course, I say Amazon.com where you can get just about any and everything for a resonable price. Thank you for having this product available. Myra"
5,Excellent study Bible,"An excellent study Bible for Catholics and all who are interested in summaries of Catholic teachings. The entire New American Bible is presented and about every sixty pages a section of questions and Catholic answers is given. With these questions and answers, specific scriptural references are given that can easily be refered to."
5,Favorite Bible,"I am a Director of Religious Education at my Catholic parish and have many different Bibles on hand. Aside from my main job, I attend a weekly bible study session and a monthly mini-retreat. The Catholic Answer Bible is always the most requested resource book during my weekly faith formation sessions and has served me well during the monthly parent meetings I facilitate or lead. The special apologetic inserts have motivated adults to learn more about their faith and have given them more confidence to read through the Bible."
3,Its good for the purpose you buy it for,I bought it to answer questions on specfic areas that are difficult for people that are not Catholic. However it is another bible and I have plenty.
5,Wonderful Resource!,"I LOVE this Bible! It's filled with extra pages that answer questions you always wanted to ask about Catholicism. This would be a wonderful gift for a friend who has questions or wants to know more about the Catholic faith, and it's also a popular choice for RCIA classes. Highly recommend it!"
5,"""FACE IT, ALEX: YOU'RE A BORN STARFIGHTER!""","The Movie:When I was young, ""The Last Starfighter"" always held my attention with it's awesome CG effects. Now I'm older, CG Film Effects are far more advanced, but this film still holds up! With its mix of exciting action, romance, and CG effects that are as fresh now as they were in 1984, ""The Last Starfighter"" is a remarkable film that will remain a masterpiece for years to come! Movie Grade: A+DVD Review:""The Last Starfighter"" is given an exceptional DVD release! The picture has never been mor exquisite, the sound never more clear. The behind-the-scenes documentary is one of the best ever produced. With DVD, ""The Last Starfighter"" will last forever! DVD Grade: A+"
4,I call this a classic for any sci-fi collection.,"if you like sci-fi, this is one to be in your collection. It was well written and has characters you can believe in. The special effects may not be up to today's standards but they are believable. You can really get into this movie and wished you were the main character. By this one new, you will want to watch it over and over again."
4,Classic 80's Sci-fi,"This movie will take you back to the 80's when video games were king and kids couldn't put enough quarters in them. The movie is pretty good considering the time period. It has that kind of TRON feel to it, the way most of the Sci-fi movies of the time were. Overall, I recommend it to add to your collection if your trying to round out your 80's movie collection."
5,FL_Deb,"My family and I love this movie and we wore out our VHS tape recently. When everything is so uncertain it's nice to be able to watch something that can make you laugh and smile, and not have to worry about language or sexual content. The price was terrific, the packaging was very adequate, and it arrived just as promised."
5,Review of Last Starfighter,Very well scripted movie with much action and adventure included with the ending to the movie as one that is great where the planets were saved.
3,Is the movie still edited?,"I have not seen the 25th anniversary edition but I have the standard DVD release. I'm wondering if the 25th is also missing the night scene between the boy and girl on the bench? I was really disappointed that this really innocent scene between the two was omitted. There was nothing inappropriate or obscene. They just talked and if I remember correctly, they just lightly kissed. Anyway, I really don't like ""them"" releasing movies that are edited for some reason or another."
4,Exciting and safe for the kids.,"This was a very good movie from a time when there was no foul language permitted or sexual content or excessive bloody violence. Robert Preston was fairly late in his career, but he was the highlight of the movie. This is worthwhile cinema."
4,Give it a 3.5 - Great for Watching with Grandson,"More than dated special effects, but light fanciful story that was entertaining to 10 year old grandson as well as 62 year old grandfather. Nice to have in travel collection."
3,The Last Star Fighter,I had not viewed this movie in a long time and remembered it has being better. It is an ok movie-nostalgic and cute.
5,At last The Last Starfighter,This movie uses some of the very first computer generated effects which pass with flying color for the age of the movie. The story is about having a desire but that desire is fulfilled with a twist of faith.
3,Blast from the 80's,"This was never a great movie, and it hasn't aged well. Still, it's a moment in cinematic history, when it was thought that cheesy CGI effects could carry a flick, even if they were far from realistic. It's the ultimate in teenage wish fulfillment: playing a video game lets you save the galaxy and get the girl."
5,Fun,"This movie was fun in the 1980's and I rented it for my 10 yr old son since he liked War Games ( another 1980's movie). Entertaining for kids. This is not a classic but if I remembered it from all those yrs ago, it obviously made some impression. Robert Preston always portrayed a good flim flam man. No nudity or bad language...I'm not normally a prude but I guess I am where the 10 yr old is concerned! LOLI also highly recommend War Games if your kids have not seen it."
2,Bluray with substandard picture quality.,"This movie is good fun. While it is not the best Sci Fi movie around it does deserve a higher rating than what I am about to give.My problem with this movie is the transfer, picture quality is quite poor compared to what most movies on bluray look like.If you have used photoshop or a similar program imagine using the noise and despeckle feature. Move the slider to MAX and you'll get what we have here, faces that lose all detail and look like plastic masks. Unfortunately the lack of definition is visible trough the whole movie and there are only a few bits that are more aceptable for a bluray disc.Since I have never bought the DVD this is is a big improvement over my VHS tape. I am very happy to see this movie again with better quality but if the studio would have made some effort this disc could have been light years better than what it is."
3,A Hero story based in space,"The acting is passable, the effects are old school, and you know that the hero is going to win the day and get the girl. All this and I still like the whole thing. Great to watch with kids. Robert Preston steals all the scenes that hes in, what a bargain for your entertainment dollar."
3,Classic movie,"I remember watching this movie as a kid in the 80's. It's a classic film with some very bad graphics...lol. Trailer park, video game, aliens, invading armada, space battle. Basically sums up the whole movie. If you love corny 80's classics then pick it up."
3,Classic 80's awesomeness,"This is a good ol' fashioned sci-fi movie. It has everything you love to see, aliens, romance, danger, spaceships, lasers, and bad comic relief. I was surprised by the special effects. they didn't suck as bad as I would have expected. This movie has me torn because its not very good, yet it was a lot of fun watching and I would recommend it to everyone who loves fun movies. There are much better sci-fi movies out there, but few as fun as this one. Check it out."
5,Great 80's Movie,Loved the movie when I was a kid and love it as an adult. If you like the 80's style space movies buy it today.
5,A Mild Classic,"This movie is a classic for people who can say they watched it when they were kids or at least during a time when computer generated effects were non-existent. This movie was one of the first to attempt it. It's definitely a movie. It has a very interesting plot. It plays sort of like a typical sci-fi movie, expect the sci-fi plot is in the background for most of the movie, and the highlighted plot is about this kid having to deal with the fact that he is really awesome at video games and they need him to be really awesome at saving a planet... with a spaceship."
4,Excellent picture and sound.,"The transfer to blu-ray is excellent. One thing that really blew me away was an exterior shot of planet Rylos at the end. On DVD you probably can't see much, but in HD you can really see detailed buildings way in the background. Great stuff. The sound is also very impressive.I never realized how wholesome this movie is for older kids - sure there's a lot of killing and it's got a romantic subplot, but it has good messages about responsibility and friendship. Lot's of fun for families."
3,And Cuuuut !,I Was wondering if anyone noticed the sceens that are missing from the movie that i did. like when the robot is sent to impersonate the star in the movie he makes a pass at his girlfriend and she slaps him. or when they are at the lake with friends sitting on a log smoking pot. why do they cut movies up when they go to tapes or dvd ?
3,Early science fiction cheesy!,"I had forgotten how totally cheesy this movie is! The special effects are laughable and bad, but it does have its appeal. My three year old likes it! It has aliens, space ships, space fights--all done by a boy with a fluffy 1980s haircut. I would say this movie almost borders on cult film. You definitely have to be in the right mood to enjooy this movie."
2,Haven't been able to watch,"Even though it says that it can still play on a normal dvd player, it does not work on our play station 2. Hopefully it would play on a regular dvd player like it says."
4,The Last Starfighter,"Fantastic animated special effects and makeup that are probably the basis for today's high tech, computer generated effects. The story is a little hokey, but it's still fun to watch over and over again for nostalgic value."
4,Starlight Starbright - Interstellar,"The Music Man and his video game - but it's more, just a test ! Pre Star Trek spinoffs are stale this is the beginning, straight "" country boy does good"" plot extended to the stars. Yeah - I've done time in ""Trailer Parks "" ( Caravan Parks in Aussie ) and I wanted out and up too ! I lost my video game edge when I got specs, but watching this flick is 'living a dream' - escapism. Just enough woman trouble to fill in the touchy feely side of the universe too ! I must admit they stole the mask for the Friendly alien Grigg - and reused it as the Grinch ! OK for fun, escapism, and lots of wishful dreaming - watch it !"
4,"Excellent, Fun Adventure!!","This film is just all around fun and enjoyable. I highly recommend this DVD version. The ""Making Of"" documentry is very imformative which gives you real insight to the technology used in making it."
3,totally awesome!,this movie was sweet! graphics were awesome! I remember watching it as a kid but watching it again after all this time made it even better. I thought the graphics were cool considering the advancement in technology since then. The scene where he actually beats the record and the whole trailor park city is there cheering for him was great!!!
4,A DVD review,"A DVD that I have in my collection mainly because I like sci-fi and for historical reasons; first major use of CGI. The plot is a little over used and definitely geared to a younger crowd. I remember enjoying it as a teenager. The picture quality wasn't as good as `Widescreen review' says. The compression artifacts were very apparent in some scenes but these were short non-action scenes. The documentary was good hosted by Lance Guest and mainly deals with the CGI aspect of the film. The commentary was adequate and gave some interesting info on working with the actors. The production photos were just character shots, even more boring than usual. Overall, a good DVD to have in your collection especially if you're interested in the history of CGI in filmmaking."
4,Great movie,My son who turned nine was just thrilled with the concept of being called to active service from a video game. Being a gamer himself I'm sure he dreams about being called to duty. Lots of action & imagination for a little boy.
5,Science Fiction and Fantasy Epic!,"This is probably the best science fiction film other than the ""Star Wars"" and ""Star Trek"" films. Its mixture of a sci-fi action and fantasy-like happenings makes it a masterpiece. Let's face it. Who else could've come up with the idea of a youn man playing a game, breaking the record, and then being taken to a place where the game's fiction is reality? It was an original idea. The game was actually a sort of training system, used to find someone with the talent to use a real spacecraft. Nick Castle is a great director. Lance Guest (who was also in ""Jaws: The Revenge"") is a talented actor. The plot, the storyline, and Craig Safan's score, make this a film that is suredly a big hit with the fans of cult science fiction epics. They should make a sequel. The sequel would make a good amount of money. I guarantee it."
4,Right under the StarWars Trilogy!,"Probably the most fun sci-fi besides the StarWars movies. It's got cool effects, realistic creature designs, and an awesome soundtrack! The cast gives a innocent and great performance. Even though i watched it a ton of times as a kid, it's still just as fun now, just gotta love those ""Dream to be a hero"" flicks."" I always wished there would be a sequel to this film...oh well. Alex Rogan (lead character): ""Back to bed Lewis or i'll tell mom about your playboys!"" Besides the great action, it's got humour too! A very inspirational movie, watch it!"
4,"Cool but dated effects, pretty good acting...","I'm not sure why, but I really enjoy this film. Well, I also really enjoyed ""TRON"" when it came out. Maybe I'm a sucker for computer graphics.In any case the story line is based on a small town just graduated HS student who escapes his mundane life by playing a video game. Then one night he breaks the high score -- he's the hero of the trailer park. Well, before long aliens appear, he's whisked off on an adventure, and everyone else is wondering what's happening!The story is classic radio sci-fi fantasy, the acting is fine, and the computer animation that supports the story broke the trail for the more sophisticated digital animation that rules in box offices today.I give this movie four stars only because of the somewhat dated appearance of the FX, but I still thoroughly enjoy this story.It's worth a try, as long as you're not expecting too much -- a great movie for a calm Saturday afternoon."
3,Brain Dead Movie,"If you want to relax, turn the brain off for a while this is one of those movies. Fun, non-thinking, just have a good time.Hey, I have seen it and have a great time!!!!"
2,Didn't age well...,"One of my favorites as a kid but upon viewing recently I found out that just because you liked something 20 years ago doesn't mean you are going to like it now. Ashame, but that's how it is.The movie has a paper thin plot and almost no character development plus it tries to work overly hard at pulling at the heart-strings.Computer graphics were great for them but are distracting now.If you have a child and they like video games they may like they movie but it is a product of the 80's.My only question is, what happened to the Beatiful Catherine Mary Stewart?"
1,BE FOREWARNED !!!!!,"Some of these are being shipped to Fry's Electronics in cases labeled, ""HD-DVD / DVD COMBO.""These are not combo discs, so if you're thinking you'll get yourself a dvd copy of The Last Starfighter really cheap -- THINK AGAIN !!It took me 20 minutes to convince the uneducated Manager On Duty that the disc had been placed in the wrong case by the Manufacturer.Be Forewarned ! Like the guy standing next to me at the returns counter said, ""That's a dead format; no matter why you bought it, you shouldn't have.""Your Friendly Consumer Advocate, Jim"
1,Don't Get This HD / DVD,This would be great if it worked...The DVD does NOT match the packaging which says that one side of the DVD is for regular DVD players and the other side is for HD players. The DVD actually has only 1 side which does not work on any high end HD DVD player or my macbook. I was VERY disappointed!
3,Breezily forgettable,"The Bottom Line:The Last Starfighter isn't a bad movie, but it's one we've seen time and time again so why bother wasting your money on it--unless you want to better appreciate the Onion article ""George Bush cites The Last Starfighter as Inspiration for Entering Politics"" or to see one of the first uses of CGI in a movie, skip this disposable piece of filmmaking.2.5/4"
3,80's sci-f- favorite!,"It was a movie I enjoyed when I was young,there were alot of good movies from the 80's so I wanted to share them!"
5,Fun,perfectthis was a great addition to my collection. We had a great time watching it. The disc was in excellent shape.
3,Good find,"I bought it used. Packaging was ok but the case was dirty. The disc was fine. The tunes still sounded clean. Overall, a satisfying buy for my collection. Thanks."
3,Uh. Sorry...,"Amazon reviewer. These guys ARE Echo and the Bunnymen all over again. When they try to get tougher than a spun cotton candy sound, they just sound pretentious. My downloads: All I Want, Pure, Sweet Dreams, Don't Let Go, The Price. Now my copy goes back on the market."
4,"Loved by all, not just the gfcf kid","I made these last weekend, as replacing my 3 year old's favorite chocolate chip cookies was paramount in his acceptance of a new restricted diet. I used egg replacer when I made these. Although they are a little bit sweet for me, everyone who has tried them really liked them, and had no idea that they were gfcf. I am ordering more..."
1,Poorly edited and frankly quite boring,"It is very hard to see how anyone could find this book ""engrossing"" or ""fascinating"", let alone ""beautifully written"". As it is the prose is barely acceptable, and the text rambling and repetitive. This book has very much the feel of a first manuscript from a fledgling writer, before he learned anything of the craft. Anyone looking for interesting and revealing dialogue, won't find it in this book. The text could easily have been trimmed down to half its size without losing anything. It is quite annoying to be constantly reminded of what ""Palomar glue"" is, and to wade through countless iterations of similar bits of trivia. Things like how to treat glass, the definition of a ""gadgeteer"", and the design of the telescope. We got it the first time around, mr Preston! Basically, you can stop reading the book halfway through, and then throw it away. Unless you want to read the same text all over again but with the words in a ! slightly different order."
3,Somebody find this guy an editor!,"Great topic. Intiguing charcters. Lots of fun to read. Unfortunately this book reads like a first draft instead of a final copy. Richard Preston's sentence structure is terrible. He tends to repeat himself...alot!! Like his other books, the topics and information are wonderful; he needs somebody to keep him organized."
1,"""Land of 1000 Temples"" is not my cup of ""Thai.""","I was very disappointed with this video. It is an old travelogue probably filmed in the late sixties or early seventies. The picture quality is grainy and the color is bad. The Thailand depicted here is not the Thailand of today. In the last two decades Thailand has changed dramatically, and many of the statements made in the video are no longer true. I would suggest that you make another choice if you are looking for looking for a video on Thailand"
2,Needs substantial improvement,"Heavy perspiration a logical result of intense exercise goes through the neoprene and wets the Ipod.I've tried to put the armband on top of the t-shirt sleeve to no avail.Furthermore any type of weight lifting even moderate or arm movement loosens the band , sliding it down the arm. Do NOT use it to row, weight lifting, elyptical bike, or in any situation associated with arm motion. It is acceptable for stationary bike riding and leisurely walking. Sweat permeatiion is still an issue.Otherwise the Ipod can be well operated with the cable out of the way.Not worth the money since it doesn't fulfill basic claims"
3,Richard T. Button,"Oh Dick Button.. where do i even begin? we have watched your marvels through many years, and we still will in the many years to come. Your amazing talents on ice will always keep us captivated, just like your writing. Poetry with words just like your poetry on ice. First figure skating, then law school, then you make it as a producer, and now.... you are an amazing author. Dick Button: you will always be a legend, and not only in my eyes, but in the eyes of the world."
2,repeat performance,"Finally a new Foxtrot.Whoops. it's is just a repeat taken from other Fox Trots.I've got ALL previous Fox Trots.Now I know what treasuy means.Bill, did you do this?"
1,really dissapointed,the product did not play rightit also was not very helpful when i could see some partsnot enough information asfar as booting up the system for the first time how to partion the drive and formatting it just over all bad not worth the money at all
5,Perspective,"I happened upon this book at Amazon and it is one of the best books I have read. I finished it in about 2 days, put it down and then started all over again. We all need a fresh perspective on our lives now and then, and this book did that for me. When our lives are spent acquiring things it is easy to conclude that the quality of life is based on what we have or what can be purchased. This book is so important in the affluent culture we live and are raising our children. I love the viewpoint, that we often find ourselves ""keeping up with the Jones'"" when in fact WE are the Jones' for much of the population. We always seem to compare ourselves to those who have more than we have, not those who have less. This book is like taking blinders off your eyes!"
4,On you own reaching for awareness,"I picked up this book in the library and found it to be a wonderful read. It is helping me to get back on my feet after a multitude of recent major life ""setbacks"".The author describes important principles in the development of adulthood and shows ways in which we can restart our growth to becoming full, human adults."
1,Lacking depth,"I am amazed this book has affected so many so deeply. I almost felt like it was a waste of my time. Comming from the perspective of a reader of the Bible and CS Lewis, I felt like the ideas and advice were not deeply thought provoking or motivating. A few comments of Mandino's provided enough food for thought for a few seconds contemplation but not more. Furthermore, I dislike thin and uninteresting plots with the soul intention to preach. I do not intend to read any more of Mandino's works."
3,"Informative book, but very repetitive","Potential buyers should keep in mind that this is a book about Chinese business etiquette. It is a specific topic, not a general treatise on Chinese culture.Buknall is thorough, but repetitive. He beats to death the concepts of hierarchy and waiting for approval from various people/governmental agencies.He references the late 90's in the book and mentions more than once that certain historical customs are beginning to give way to more modern practices. That was six years ago. Thus, the book is in need of an update.One other thing I've noticed is the high number of misspelled and missing words. The editor did a very poor job.Overall, an informative book, but one that could be better."
4,DOING BUSINESS IN CHINA,"I have no hesitation in recommending this book. It is a must read for anyone planning to do business in China.As of 2005,it is out of date regarding lifestyle and living standards in China, however, the cultural facts are correct, in particular the aspects of culture crucial to negotiating with the Chinese."
5,Concise,Common sense is not that common and this is one of those little gems. It doesnt play on details and if detail is what you require perhaps you can by pass this. What it does give you is a snap shot of how the Chinese are different to us and how best to behave around them. That in itself is so important if it is your intention to do business there in the future.
2,Is the hype for real?,"A founding member of the hip hop/rap world I give him, but to many mixes that somehow do not carry over here to vinyl...maybe I should listen in a club."
4,What is Truth?,"This is supposed to be a portrait of a man with two turntables, a mixer and records. In fact, it is a contrived studio work fabricating a false image of a legendary era. Flash must really live up to his name if any of this is authentic. At my calculations he would have to be able to switch a record and cue the next one in 1/10 of a second........However, it DOES sound funky."
4,Great product,This is a great inexpensive cable. It works well on my new tv. I am very happy with this item. I have to write 20 words. What can you say about a cable?
5,A Dark and Beautiful Drive,"Another intensely beautiful, achingly sad, low-budget masterwork from East River Pipe. The Gasoline Age is in a dead heat with The Flaming Lips' The Soft Bulletin for my '99 Album of the Year. Both releases are utterly ""human"" (in the best sense), superbly musical, and vaguely disturbing. Pure and simple gems, in an time of money-led and hype-led averageness."
3,"good effort, buy it, but...","i had high expectations of this cd. one guy in his own studio working on it until he gets it right. typically that results in some good music. this cd's got a lot of good music, it's soft and very easy to listen to, but the problem with the album is the lyrics. the fact is that they're just not good or abundant. there are five minute songs that have a minute of vocals where two things are repeated twice. not bad for one song in five but for almost every song it gets annoying and repetitive.bottom line, this is a cd that deserves to sell well. a lot of people should be hearing this type of music. but there are still some holes in the craftmanship of this record."
3,maybe it'll grow on me....,"although i've only listened to this record once, i must say that so far at least, it's a disappointment. the songs just aren't that good. they're interesting and they definately create a vibe, but they're just not that strong. but i guess ""interesting"" counts for something....doesn't it?"
2,"A song from Law & Order: Criminal Intent ""Privilege""","Track 6 is the song played during the introduction of ""Privilege,"" from Law & Order: Criminal Intent. It is a lovely song--artistic, addictive, soulful. That's why I bought it--the rest of the tracks seem sort of of a combination of New Age and alternative, and hasn't warranted a closer listen yet. But that one song, ""Pride,"" is worth the price of admission to this album."
5,Destiny is AWESOME!,"I just had to buy this album after hearing the song ""Destiny"" as the opening of the ""Conviction,"" the Law & Order spin-off which was cancelled far too soon! I also really enjoy ""Pride,"" the rest of the album doesn't quite excedd the excellence of those two songs, but it is a really pleasant listen."
5,amazing,"amazing talent, my son gave me this disk after he bought it, wow every track connects, so rare, anyway if you see this CD in the music store, buy it!"
5,Fantastic CD,Difficult to find import. Amazon price is right. The CD/Group is great. This is the 3rd copy I've purchased - for gifts.
3,Good Book - needs revising,"The concept taught in this book (of the methods used to evaluate a company) is very good.It's an extra tool to use in evaluating a company - a very sensible tool. The only reason I gave this book 3 stars is because a lot of the figures in the examples are wrong. They refer to the Financial Statements of Wriggley at the beginning of the book, but then they transpose the wrong amounts in the examples."
3,Good but not enough,"It does not provide investment strategy, when to buy and when to sell. It concerns self-financing and return on capital employed only. Insufficient for a novice investor."
4,Good Christmas Program,This is a nice book to use as a Christmas Program. Don't forget to get permission from the publisher.
1,WORLD LIFE INTERNATIONAL VIDEO - SICILY,"DIDN'T RATE THIS A ""0"" BECAUSE THIS OPTION IS NOT OFFERED. THIS IS JUST SOMEBODY'S HOME MOVIE WITH MONOTONOUS VOICE-OVER ... (AT MOST TIMES TOO LOUD FOR VOICE-OVER!) MUSIC. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY."
5,Great gift!,I got this for my husband for Christmas - and he was absolutely thrilled! A new gadget with great results!
3,Difficult to re-assemble.,"I didn't mean for this to be a negative review.... but I wanted folks to know that the tines do not easily line up when re-assembling this unit following cleaning. This can be frustrating because these tines/blades are very sharp and that obviously can be an issue. Perhaps the one I received just has the tines/blades slightly out of alignment and this is a rare problem, I had actually read about this problem in another review and marked it down as an isolated case, but now I dont think so.That said, This thing works great and definitely does the job as advertised as far as tenderizing goes.My suggestion is to wash without disassembing and you will be fine. Or buy the model that does not disassemble."
5,Don't Pass This One Up!,"This is a must-have. Far superior to any meat tenderizer I've tried before. It simply gets the job done and gets it done well. You won't believe how tender your meat will be after using this tool. It comes apart for easy cleanup. Get it, you won't be disappointed!"
4,Terderizes meat perfectly,"The Jaccard does the job and does it well.It does have two draw backs:#1 The cover falls off very easily. It needs some dimples to hold it on better.#2 Try not to disassemble the unit (take the cartridge out). If you do, it is horrible to try to reassemble the unit. I have spent 10 minutes trying to get the knifes all in line to get it to go back together. I now just put it in the dish washer and the dish washer does an excellent job of cleaning it."
3,reassembling after cleaning,"I would use this product, The Jaccard Tenderizer, more offen if I could reassemble it after cleaming. Where can I find the answer for this problem? The tines do not aline after I clean the tool."
4,good item,have it use it a few times works good cleaning is easy throw it in the dishwaser wouldnt pay over 30.00 tho
5,likes to cook,"I've been meaning to buy one these for a while after I saw Alton Brown using one. I wish I had bought one the day after that show. It's great. It does everything it claims, tenderizes meats, allows faster cook times and allows marinades to penetrate better. No more hammering meat flat to try tenderizing. This does a 1,000% better job and you don't render a one inch cut of meat to a quarter of an inch. In today's economy this thing pays for itself by being able to buy leaner cuts of meat that are usually tougher but can be bought at a lower price. Use this puppy on them and the meat will be so tender you'll think your eating way more expensive cuts of meat. Also the leaner cuts of meat are healthier to eat.As Alton Brown would say, this is one uni-tasker every kitchen should have."
4,Good,"Received everything Ok, I Like it, works well and beautiful design and I recommend to my friends. thank you, bye"
5,Jaccard Meat tenderizer-At last a tender steak for my husband with dull partials,"My husband only has a few teeth & a very dull partial to eat with. I used to grind his meat, or buy him a cubed steak that ended up being tough w/grissel in it. We are both very happy with this 45 blade Jaccard. It's a little pricey, but now at this time of our lives a few extra dollars to be able to eat a good piece of steak, etc. when we want to, makes it worth it.Jaccard Simply Better Meat Tenderizer Knife 45 Blade Stainless Steel Md: 200345NS"
5,Excellent tool,"Excellent tool that works well, and is easy to use. Clean up is fine even though I believe it is best to take it all apart just to be sure you clean every part. I tell the husband to leave it in the sink after he's done so I can properly wash it. I end up soaking the pieces in hot soapy water first, then scrubbing it lightly and then throughtly rinsing in hot water.We chose the bigger bladed tenderizer that we could take apart, and I am very glad that we did. So far there are no issues. It works and is very sturdy."
5,Tenderizing is easy and fun!,"My husband has attacked every piece of meat which has dared to enter our house. Easy to use and clean, we are using this tool daily in our home."
3,Works great but hard to clean,Made my steak extra tender.But cleanup was difficult as the 3 blades are stuck together.I guess if you had a long brush or something.
2,not as good as described,"I have only tried this on 3 grassfed steaks. The first one I knew needed ""help"" (sirloin), so I vigourously ""jaccardized"" it , both sides , at different angles. It turned out being only bareable chewable, which surprised me. I jaccardized another(delmonico), more tender cut, and again, no super tender steak obtained. I tried yet ANOTHER piece, different animal, where I know the steak would be more tender in general. This time there were 2 steaks (ribeye) in the package, so I had a control. Again, not much difference! I am not an idiot, I used the device firmly, but not like a gorilla. I also didn't spend 10 minutes pulverizing the meat, as I thought a few minutes would suffice (tha above were ALL small pieces of meat). In conclusion, surprisingly disappointed, yet I will keep trying to use it. Perhaps there is a secret ""trick"" I havent come across. I wish they had included it with the directions."
5,Wish I'd bought this years ago,"This tenderizer is sharp, sturdy, and easy to use. I've used it for pork chops, chicken, and steaks before I add marinade. Results are wonderful. I clean it immediately after use, with hot sudsy water and a brush, then rinse well with a sprayer. This works fine; I've not tried to disassemble."
5,IT IS A VERY THOROUGH TEXT FOR ANCIENT EGYPT AND ISRAEL,It is a text -plenty of information and references- for the relation between Andcient Egypt and Israel.
2,Not far enough,"While his intent is laudable, he fails to go far enough in his research or thinking on the subject. For example, the idea that the plagues of Exodus were based on well-known, regular occurences such as the flooding of the Nile is absurd, demanding more belief in the stupidity of ancient man than is warranted. Similarly theories about the Exodus being a ""compilation"" of a couple of hundred slaves leaving Egypt over a number of years is so stupid as to beggar belief, if it were not advanced under the cover of academia. Long's ""The Riddle of the Exodus"" presents a better thesis."
4,Good book on the Egyptian side of the Exodus account,"A fresh look at the accounts of the Exodus from the perspective of an Egyptologist.I don't agree with his perspective on the unreliability of scripture, but, other than that, he brings up some intruiging aspects of the culture and politics of the time."
5,"Good, practical advice from the trenches","The author wastes no time getting into solid, practicaladvice for successful product management. As must readfor anyone considering or already in the field, itprovides practical and insightful advice on everythingfrom running teams to product pricing."
5,Product Management for Technologists,"This book is all you ever wanted to know about product management, but were afraid to ask. This book discusses the relationship between technical-artcitecture and marketing-architecture. This is an oft-neglected subject, but it is important as marketing and technology are both important for a successful product. In addition to great content, the writing is very clear. I read the book quickly, but will be using it as a reference for a long time to come. This is a great book to read if you design software systems, or are involved in product management."
1,Reinventing the wheel,"I had great hopes for this book, but for any industry veteran it is basically a repackaging of what many other ""experts"" have written before. The book is needlessly verbose, but yet glosses over key points with literary hand waving. The lack of significant examples, business cases, and real world process development gives one the feeling the book is merely the presentation of a thesis or philosophy devoid of concrete real world application.For someone just starting out in the industry they may glean some basic concepts, but there are so many more publications that do a better job and do it cleaner."
5,Size Matters,"Having tried every possible type of headphone I've finally found some that work and work very well. These are so comfortable, much more portable than the large ""noise cancelling"" headphones and honestly, there is little to no difference in the audio quality. Size does matter when traveling and frankly, because of the snug fit, the only thing you hear is music. Anything that lessens my load when traveling is a godsend. Spend the money you save on itunes."
4,Nice Surprise,"I was expecting another hair metal band when I burned this to CD from cassette. I've had this thing lying in a box for twenty years and finally burned it. I've listened to it several times and right away found it to be a lot better than what I vaguely remembered from way back when.They are more of a hard rock band with a hair metal influence thanks to the drum sound, the singer's pitch and of course, their liner photos. However, the songs are what sets them apart. They have a bit of variety and some decent surprises that keep things interesting. Instead of generic rockers fit for mass consumption (I just used that term in another review tonight), there is variety with some hard rocking followed by bluesy interludes followed by interesting time signature and harmony changes.There was enough variety and likable music to keep me listening. Recommended."
3,Cute but fell apart.,"This costume is adorable, my 5 year old loved the pink color & sparkly belt, however, when it arrived the neckline was torn apart. Since I needed it right away, I took it to a seamstress to repair it. By the time Halloween night was over, it had three holes throughout the shirt part and the felt skirt was all fuzzy. Too bad since it really was a cute outfit, the material just didn't hold up at all."
1,Very Itchy,"Very itchy. My daughter wouldn't even wear it. Luckily, the price was low enough that it wasn't worth it to pay to ship it back."
1,"Cheaply Made, Runs WAY Small","This is one of those cheap Halloween-type costumes you'd get at W-Mart in a plastic bag. Very cheaply made, strings coming off the seams the minute I took it out of the bag. Cheap, itchy fabric. Runs WAY small! Ordered my daughter's size, according to the size chart, and it was at least three sizes too small. Returning it immediately. Don't waste your time/money."
1,Cute idea but cheaply made,"Purchased for my daughter's school play. She ripped it when taking it off the first time (sigh) trying it on here at home. Also the shirt part was very body hugging which as a developing pre-teen, she didn't like. I don't think the sizing is right. She wears a 12-14 depending on the clothes maker, but I'd say this more a size 10."
1,HORRIBLE,SITE LISTED THAT MY PHONE WOULD BE ELIGABLE BUT IT WAS NOTTT..HORRIBLE SERVICE AND CLIENT..LIED AND DECIEVIED TO CUSTOMERS. DO NOT ORDER FROM HIM!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,The Traditional One To Buy,"For those of you who may be performing the show, this is the one to buy. It is true to how the show was written. The 1992 version with Nathan Lane is much more campy and has a lot of additional music. It is not what you want to learn the songs by. This is the version."
5,Great Musical,"This musical, ia one of the best I've ever seen, and what makes it so good? The music. This soundtrack is one that you just have to buy. With great songs like ""Luck be a Lady"", and ""Sit Down You're Rockin' the Boat"", this CD blows me away. A must-have for musical fans."
4,2nd place after the peerless movie soundtrack.,"This version is the best of what is available on cd. You just can't top the Frank Sinatra, Marlon Brando movie sountrack. Brando's song ""your eyes"" sang very tenderly by Brando is missing in all the Broadway versions. In the movie, the actors are perfectly matched to their roles. That is not the case in many recent revivals. Where can I get the movie sountrack CD?"
3,Does anyone have this one???,"Hmmmmmmm, it seems like everyone has seen this one in the bargain bin, but no one has it. I don't understand that as this is a decent effort by the Dirt Band.If you are like me, and I hope you are ;), you dig Jeff Hanna's vocals and you tolerate Jimmy Ibbotson's just to hear Hanna. Well if you are like that, you hit the jackpot here, as Hanna is in abundance. In fact, if you really like Hanna, ""Just Enough Ashland City"" is one of his best latter day efforts. Ibbotson is there too, however, with throw away numbers like ""Junior's Grill"" and ""Hillybilly Hollywood.""The music hear basically fits the sound of ""Hold On"" and ""Working Band""Songs are: From Small Things; Waitin' on a Dark Eyed Gal; Junior's Grill; Bow Out The Stars, Turn Off the Moon; The Rest of the Dream; Just Enough Ashland City; Hillybilly Hollywood; Snowballs; Wishing Well; You Made Life Good Again.You can't go wrong buying this, especially with the discount price."
1,"The Epitome of Depressing Eighties ""Writing""","This is going to be short, but sweet. This book was by far one of the most bothersome collections of short stories I have had the misfortune to come across. With authors such as Robert Lipsyte, Diane Duane, and Richard Peck, this is hardly what I would call a ""selection of great work from great writers."" For that matter, It isn't a collection of anything but chronologically trapped short stories featuring such characters as ""Craig the Cat"" the rock-star who dressed like a cat and held a bottle of spilling milk while posing atop a garbage can for magazine shoots. The biggest problem with this book is that the stories are oriented for pre-teens but to find any value or worthwhile messages in the book, you would have to be at least sixteen. Oh the sweet irony. As a young teenager, I feel that this book was a complete was of time. G'day."
3,Do not confuse this with other Greatest Hits album,"For some reason, there are reviews for Jack Jones' Greatest Hits MCA album under the similarly-titled CURB album as well as its own. Note that Jack Jones' Greatest Hits (CURB) is a different CD with different songs. It is okay but not as good as the MCA album. Buy Jack Jones Greatest Hits (MCA)."
4,Jack Jones Review,"Excellent compilation of a great singer. Jack Jones can sing as well as anyone. Having his prime in the 60s & 70s tended to diminish this great talent. If you only want one Jack Jones CD, this is the one."
4,A Big Hit!,"I purchased this CD as a Christmas gift for my father and, as soon as we finished opening our Christmas gifts, he had it on the CD player. He had recently seen Jack Jones in concert and he said that he sounds the same in person as he does on his recordings. He has been a fan since Jack Jones was in the height of his popularity so this CD was definitely a big hit. The only problem with this purchase was that the CD case was cracked when I received it, so I had to buy an empty CD case to replace the damaged one. Other than that, this was definitely a good choice for my Dad, who, truly is, one of those people who fits the description of ""a man who has everything,"" that is, everything he needs and/or wants anyway!"
1,Old footage and really boring,"This is a horrible, ripoff video. Don't buy it. It's got shaky, handheld film camera footage that has faded, zero practical or useful information and just generally wastes your time."
4,Great Book. Jayne Ann Krentz does it again,"If you liked Jayne Ann Krentz's 'Jayne Castle' books you will like these too. There is more fantasy in ""Shield's Lady"" and the other Glass books: ""Sweet Starfire"" & ""Crystal Flame"", then in the Castle books. Unfortunatly, the Glass books are not connected together. The plot is solid with great dialog and plenty of action and suspense. The culture of the world is fully fleshed-out with significant differences from ours. There is plenty of originality. I hope she uses this world again."
2,It was awful!,"Let's just say I had super high hopes for this one. They were pretty well dashed. When I was halfway through I decided it rated 2 stars, however by the end, I bumped it up to 2.5. The end was great, once the heroine stopped being a whiny little child and grew up the book was wonderful, unfortunately it took almost the whole book for her to stop acting a child. Unfortunately, the ending was not enough to make up for the rest of it. The heroine made me think of a 3 year old who claps their hands of their ears and goes ""La la la la la I'm not listening!"" That being said, the writing was wonderful, and I truly wanted to finish the book even though I hated the heroine."
4,Futurist Romance,It is always enjoyable to think about the future. Jayne explores human exploration to a new planet with two people from different continents on the planet. Love still wins out over all complications!
3,its ok,ive read other books of hers and this was a pretty basic - by the numbers book. too formulaic for me.
4,What a find!,"I had never read any of Ms. Krentz writings; but she is a writer I will be adding to my list. Her characters, although from another world, are beliveable and delighful. I could not and did not put it down until it was finished. I would very much like to meet Sarianna & Gryph's daughter in another book. Thanks Amazon for the referral."
1,LOVE Jayne Ann Krentz but NOT this one ;(,I am a lover of Jayne Ann Krentz but hated this book. The planetary alien theme didn't work for me one bit.
3,enjoyable,"This was a very engaging book, romantic, suspenful and kept me reading every chance i got.Would recomend this book to everyone."
4,Classic Jayne,"One of JAK's early 'big' novels, and great stuff. She created an imaginative world and two stubborn, delish protagonists struggling to find their place via an exciting journey to exotic locales."
4,Enjoyable read,I liked the chemistry between the main characters and the story was engaging. I will read any other in this series.
1,I didn't even finish it,"I'm sorry but I found this book extremely predictable and lacking in anything new when it comes to romantic sci-fi that I couldn't even finish it. I didn't care for either of the main characters and the one action scene that I did read was also slow and ridiculous. Gryph is supposed to be this incredible warrior that the author constantly talks up and when he gets into his first fight, he loses. Seriously? He's the best of the best? As for Sarianna, she was boring and also predictable and I just couldn't root for her."
5,Shield's Lady,I love this book. I got it years ago and have always loved the book. I just got it on my Kindle so that I wouldn't have to look for it when I felt like reading it again.
3,Shield's Lady,I really like the Harmony series and like the way the author has opened the frontier for more stories. My complaint is that it is very formulaic.
4,Sci-fi but interesting,"I really enjoyed this book. It was intersting and had some humor, but the story line kept my interest. I will definite;y look for tother books by this author."
4,Good book,"Jane Krentz is an author who I always enjoy reading. If you have enjoyed her books in the past, you will like this one. An easy read."
4,Good read.,This was a cute book hat was an easy read. It kept my interest and the characters were a lot of fun.
2,Not what I expected.,I thought this would be the typical thriller. I was not expecting something from another planet. I could not get into it and it wound up being a waste of my time and $$.
5,Nice Little Copier at a Great Price,"Looked all around for reviews on this item, and was surprised to find nothing.This is a smart product, with some great features which has worked flawlessly so far. It was out of the box and running in minutes, with hardly any instruction manual review required. Operation is smooth and quiet, and it starts instantly. Very intuitive operation.The one-piece toner cartridge is nice, and installed without problems. Some quick math indicates that copies will cost just pennies each with this unit, if the cartridge performs to specs.For our small home office use, this is perfect. While it is not fast, it works beautifully. It folds up to a small compact size, and is even portable."
4,PC 140 is fine copier,"I received the PC 140 copier in good time and am enjoying it. The toner cartridge was not very good however, but I've ordered a new one. It was too soft, not good blacks."
4,Worldly,"I have enjoyed both the Libana albums that I have purchased very much. While this type of music is not for everyone, the rounds really help me relax with their interesting rhythms that almost remind me of Gregorian chant. It's almost completely a capella and all women's voices. The influences from around the world really appeal to me as well. The musical quality is very good. This isn't something I'd listen to in the car, but it is something that I would listen to if I needed to induce calm or intense concentration."
5,For Children and adults,"I know nothing about covens or goddesses, but I do know that my daughter has listened to this since she was 5 and still listens to it(she is 10). It is especially good for going to sleep by with it's soothing rhythms and beautiful melodies and voices. I love it too."
3,"Lovely, but can get a bit monotonous","The singing is really great and I loved listening to the great range of songs from different countries. However, the songs can grate on one after frequent listenings because the singing style is relatively invariant."
5,"calming, centering music",This is a wonderful way to center oneself ~ We love listening to the different groups and wonder why we had not discovered them much sooner. :)
5,Beautiful music,Beautiful music! I believe this cd is good for anyone. The songs are wonderful. I listen to it every night before I go to bed and feel relaxed. Another good method is sitting amongst candles and relaxing.
5,"At last, I have found it again!","Several years ago, I had a bought a copy of this on tape. I ended up wearing it out, after loosing the cover, and had forgotten who had done it. :( Just a few weeks back, I was telling my lady about this after running across some sound-clips on the Web and I lamented the loss. Imagine my delight and surprise when I logged in to Amazon to see it staring me in teh face! I'll be ordering in a few weeks!"
3,Actually I give it 2 and 1/2 stars,"This album would be really good if you could understand the lyrics a litle more easily and none of their songs were about the patrichial Judeo-Christian God. After all, it's hardly appropiate to include songs and chants about God on a album that's supposed to be Goddess-centered! Also the songs are much to short.I guess if I had to sum it up in a word it would be OK. I can't really say that I reccomend it. There are lots of albums that are better."
1,"3.5"" plano rod case","not real happy. the base of the case is 3.5"" but the diameter of the tube is only 3"". very misleading."
3,Sturdy but longer than expected,"A case that holds a 8'6"" rod if a two-piece rod would need to be 4' 6"" long or 54"" when extended. My other cases are 40"" long and have worked well with all my two-piece rods. The Orvis rod case is 57"" long when fully collapsed so it is a tight fit in the cab of my truck.Wish the product description had provided this dimension as I would not have bought the case."
2,Who?,"If you're a big fan, then the fact that there are no familiar tunes on this album won't really bother you that much. If you're a fan looking for music similar to their awesome ""In A Chamber,"" this is NOT the disc for you! In the words of Monty Python's King Arthur in ""Holy Grail,"" ""You make me sad."""
2,This book hardly helped me at all!,"When I bought this book I though that I was buying a book that would help me lose weight. But instead, I bought a coaster. I only told me one exercise that I didn't know. If you really want to lose weight, all you need is will power and a little determination."
3,"Boy, if only I was younger...","This book was pretty good, however, it was written, in my opinion, for a third grader. The typeface and language is VERY simple. I was almost insulted by how the author was speaking in this book."
3,not my kind of recipes,"after reading the previous reviews, i thought it would be safe to order this book. i finally bought a crock pot and am looking for interesting recipes and information on adapting my regular recipes.there are a few recipes i will probably try, but i was appalled at the number of recipes calling for canned vegetables--for crock pot use--canned soups, dry soup mixes, etc. i was also disappointed at the number of recipes that are very very similar to those in the two other slow cooker books i've bought.i found the organization of the book annoying. the chapters are based on type of meats, and the slow cooker recipes and the casserole recipes are in each chapter. i would have found the book more convenient if it had been divided by slow cooker/casserole. that, of course, is a personal preference.the one good thing about buying this book is that now i know that i will not be interested in the other allrecipes cookbooks that are now showing up in my recommendations."
2,Already out of date,"XML is changing at a lightning fast pace, and this 2000 book is already out of date."
3,"Covers the material pretty well, but sloppy.","Overall this is an decent place to start with XML. It covers what needs to be covered to get you up to speed, and most readers with any technical background could probably could do it at about the pace that the book advertises (15 hours to get up to speed on XML.) Organization and writing are mostly OK.Hovever, the book is sloppy. It repeats itself in several places. Some editing notes are left in the text. One exercise is presented before giving proper background, so the reader doesn't even know how to do the exercise. Some obvious questions are left unanswered, leaving the reader feeling frustrated. Clearly the book was not 'street tested'.Overall, if you can forgive the books faults, you are given a good grasp of the key XML concepts. This is par for the course, and so I give it 3 stars. It gives you the knowledge you need, but does so a sloppy way."
5,A must-have for anyone interested in Lino &fine glassblowing,"From the slipcover (rear): ""Arte e design nelle opere di un grande maestro vetraio."" ... ""Art and design in the work of an outstanding master glassmaker."" ... [and again in French and German].This book is written in Italian, English, French & German. There is a 4-page introduction in each and short descriptions of every one of the 91 pieces.A wide variety of works from 1981 to 1993 are presented.If you're interested in Lino or glassblown artistic pieces, I highly recommend this book."
1,Didn't Get It,"I have read and thoroughly enjoyed several of May's books. They have been of great help to me during a very difficult time in my life. This one, however, left me cold. May seems to write, in several places, that religion is simply a crutch--which is totally at odds with his philosohpy in his other books. Furthermore, I finished the book and really can't put my finger on what point he was trying to get across except ""let it be."" How? And why does he say that relgion is a crutch in order to be one's true self? My Christianity IS who I am. It defines me, and certainly in some of May's other works, it seemed to define him, also. I am confused and dismayed. I cannot recommend this work by him."
5,Review of A TIME TO BLOSSOM,The author makes it all so real as she writes from expereince. The reader can project herself into what is being said. I have met Tovah Martin and I love her as she is so easy to talk to and she just makes everything come to life. Tovah is a garden writer and gardening is another one of my passions so I have added her to my list of special garden writers. No science fiction in what she has to say.I am a retired school llibrarian and Tovah Martin was a friend of an author/illustrator - Tasha Tudor - whom I have always enjoyed reading and looking at her books. It is hard to find words to express the excitement I had when I met Tovah Martin but I have shared my expereince with other gardeners.I purchased this book from Amazon.Com as I find that they have much of what I order on line. I go to them first.
3,Good for Beginners,"This book is quite useful for beginners and laypersons who are intimidated by intensely academic works on Canaanite and Ugaritic literature. As such, I feel it trades accuracy for approachability. If you're looking for an easy-read version of Canaanite literature, this book is perfect. If you'd like a deeper, more solid foundation, and you have no fear of footnotes, you might prefer Parker's Ugaritic Narrative Poetry."
4,Good Chip!,I like the Pentium 3 733 very much. It might be an older chip but it still packs a punch for every day applications as well as most games including new ones. If you can't afford a more powerful chip or don't need one then this could be for you!
3,worth the price,The little things are worth 10 dollars. Worked okay for about a year and then displayed connection problems. on/off button went bad and was touchy. You will probably spend more money in batteries to run it- seemed like 2 AAA would last 4-5hrs tops.
1,Forstner bit review,"Don't waste your money, buy a Fish forstner bit for $5 more. I've always bought Freud blades and bits, but this one was a big disappointment. I used it for end grain cuts, it dulled very quickly."
3,TNA can do waaaaaaay better,"Ok, TNA really droped the ball with this one, it only had two good matches. If anyone tells you this is the best TNA has to offer, don't believe it!Turning Point 2005 was waaaaaaay better, with the great Barbed Wire Massacre and AJ Styles vs Samoa Joe was waaay better then Styles vs Daniels from this ppv. Also has Team 3D vs AMW in a table match, and Rhino vs Jarret from Turning Point was great, much better then at this ppv, cause Rhino gets hit with a chair off a scaffold, and Rhino gores Jarrett through a table that's set up in the entrance.Turning Point 2005 = 9.5/10This ppv = 5/10Trust me, wait for Turning Point, not this one.And make sure it's Turning Point 2005 not 2004."
5,tna's wrestlemania,i watched this ppv live and it was awesome the ultimate x match was awesome so was the 30 minute ironman match the monsters ball was off the chart. some great tag matches to and a surprise ending toa must buy for any rhino fan
1,wth,ya i bought this pay per view because i was told this was sopposed to be tna's best pay per view of the year...ummm NO... this pay per view friggen sucked...all it was was a bunch of old wwe wreslters and awful no name wreslters with the expception of a couple of tna names like Jarret and Daniels...In the end rhino wins the world title...give me a break a stalky loser ....a guy that could only win the hard core title in wwe...and u will say becuz vince wouldnt give him a push...well ur right and it was for good reason...rhino is nothing more than a open match guy...This pay per view sucked ..I would suggest summerslam 2005 or royal rumble 2006...buy Wresltemania 22 when we see vince vs. Micheals and HHH vs.Cena
5,TNA's Finest!,"This is what fans were given as the top of the line in PPV offerings when TNA started gaining some momentum and they did not disappoint! From top to bottom, this card is exciting, thrilling, and a lot of fun to watch. It is a must have for anybody who is a wrestling fan!"
3,If you....,Can get over the horrible main event which was overbooked and featured the stag Jeff Jarrett then you will enjoy this DVD. The Iron Man matchin being the best...the bonus match of the Ultimate X was rather good too.
5,Amazing,This saved me mentally. I had just found out I had breast cancer and this dvd saved me....it grounded me and inspired me!
1,What a lousy book!,"""Ladies of the Goldfield Stock Exchange"" was horrible, and that's putting it lightly. The ladies stock exchange was overshadowed by the outbreak of pneumonia, the auto race, and the personal lives of the characters. The narrator switched too often, and the women had too many problems for the reader to focus on. Just when you became interested in one life, it abruptly switched to another, and the chapters were to short, which led to an overabundance of chapters. The ending was very sudden and too happy - don't get me wrong, I love happy endings; but, with the history of the women, it just didn't fit. The lack of an epilogue did not help, either. A waste of time and money. I do not recommend."
2,Unlikable characters,"Meggan is determined to find who killed her father and why. Tess wants enough money to live somewhere with her daughter, without the shadow of being a former prostitute. Verna has been enabling her dreamer brother her whole life while running a newspaper to support them.I couldn't get into this story. Tess is more concerned with making money for her daughter to live like a princess than loving her like a mother. Verna is a classic enabler. I couldn't like either of them so the book never captured my interest, and I quit about a quarter of the way through."
4,"Fast burner, but not burn proof.","I was able to burn an audio cd in 6 minutes at 12x using a Celeron 366!! 8 minutes for an audio cd on a CDRW at 10x. The burner is quiet too, unlike my sisters Yamaha CDRW. As for being burn-proof... while using the burn-proof technology, I thought I would be able to surf the net. I was wrong. My PC froze and therefore created an incomplete CD. This is the only reason why it did not get a 5 star rating. Also, I use Nero 5, not EZ CD Creator. I like it a lot better."
1,The Worst Burner Ever!!!!!!,"I have used HP burners and had no problems. However, the Plextor boasts being the best but just can't deliver. Final result was the plextor manager crashed my hard drive. So back it goes to California......where it belongs!"
1,What a joke!,I bought 2 of the Plextor PlexWriters it turned out to be an expensive joke. One was a gift and the other for myself. Mine didn't last 2 months before it broke down. The seller replaced it with a new one. Which last almost to the end of the year warrenty before it completely broke down. I never used mine over 12 to 15 times the entire year. The one for the gift lasted about 5 months and had to be sent in for repairs under warrenty. It lasted about another 4 months after it was repaired before it quit again. I gave this product a one star rating which is more than it deserves.
2,Not as good as other Spot books,"I have read many Spot books to my granddaughter. She loves the flaps and the stories. However, this book was not as interesting as the others. There was no story and some of the animals were hard to identify. I thought some of the pages were missing from the book but they all seemed to be there. It was the story that was missing. Anyway, another almost good Spot book."
3,Good Spot Option,This is another of the open and close spot finds things books. What I like was that there are good things to open and close. What I do not like is that all Spots friends are animals that are not usually around dogs. Our grandson enjoyed it.
3,West Coast Gansta Rap?!!?!!,"There really is only one song from this cd worth listening to for me. Murder She Wrote is still an awesome track with a slick drum track and decent hook but it is a short song. This album was produced to ride the West Coast Gansta Rap Wave of the late 80's/early 90's. Popular at the time were NWA, The Ghetto Boys, and DJ Quick. You will hear a lot about her being a Ruthless B*tch, white and Italian. But if you want to add to your West Coast Gansta Rap collection, then the one track you will need is Murder She Wrote."
5,Just what I wanted,I LOVE the 3 spoon section rather than 2. It is exactly what I was looking for and is very attractive.
1,Cheap,It is very light weight and has a cheap feel to it. I did not think it was plastic when I ordered it but in fact it is plastic. They do not tell you it is plastic so how would the person buying it know. Do not recommend this item.
3,OK book but not great for learning basic radiology,This is a good book to read through but not as a primary resource. Use this book for quick recall after reading other radiology books.
1,Painful,"An absolutely atrocious novel. Remarkable how one can write an entire novel, without once asking oneself if the requisite talent is there. Somewhat excusable, if this novel was written as part of a community service sentence. A truly painful experience for any reader."
3,works,"THis one has no elastic to provide tension. Its all based on keeping the adjusting straps snug.(in back) Tends to loosen when moving around doing yard work for example, but it has it's own kind comfort without the constant tension of the elastic types.I use mine weekly. Washes easily in the machine and I hand dry it out."
3,Temporary fix,Part arrived on time and was packaged in new condition. I had some difficulty adjusting all the many straps. When fitted it helped for a while. I finally was granted permission to fix the problem which necessitated the order in the first place. Consequently I no longer need this product but was happy to have it at the time.
1,Don't waste your time and money on this item.,"Extremly uncomfortable, rough material. Could not use. Bought small size based on other reviews. Would need at least a medium and possibly a large."
4,Fun? Wow!,"I admit that I don't need a book to tell me that my ice should be fresh, or that mailing invitations is better than picking up the phone...however, this book is extremely entertaining and I actually learned a few things too. I love the way dummies books don't need to be read in a linear fashion. Pick any chapter and get ready to laugh. Any guy who throws parties for celebrities and isn't stuck up about it is cool in my books. The other review I read says this book isn't for dummies, it's for morons. Only a moron would say that. Frivolous? Yes! But it's a fun read and I plan on buying a few copies as birthday gifts for my swellegant friends. - A.P."
1,This is a book for morons! Not dummies.,"Poor graphics, this is simply Bee self promotion rather than a guide to anything."
2,great songs and compositions,"I loved the compositions and Phil's singing, with his orchestra this is a good DVD let down by the poor video quality it looks like a video transfer, I was dissapointed to say the least I think Phil Coulters music is beautiful and uplifting sorry the DVD is a let down it would have been A1 such a shame."
1,Terrible,"What they don't tell you is that most of the buildings are either unlivable or impossible to get into without a broker.They claim ""the book gives guidance as to how to rent any of the properties listed without a broker's fee"" but it's simply not true."
1,My least favorite of all the New York apartment guides,"It reminds me of those junky lists sold by apartment information vendors. It's not much of a neighborhood guide either. ""Relocating to New York City and Surrounding Areas : Everything You Need to Know Before You Move and After You Get There!"" by Ellen R. Shapiro and ""Native's Guide to New York: Advice With Attitude for People Who Live Here--And Visitors We Like"" by Richard Laermer"" are much better."
1,All of the information in this book is available on the web for free,"in fact, none of it is even hard to find now that so many landlords and management companies have their own websites where apartment hunters can browse listings and get all the specific requirements for qualifying from the owners themselves. You can easily find a Free No Fee NYC Apartment List with Websites and Contact Information for Landlords and Management Companies, they're all over the net. Save your money for your move and stay away from this book."
1,Had to ask for a refund,"I`m only half way through but had to ask for a refund as this was labeled entirely wrong. If you think you`re going to get a menage story then you`re wrong. This is a boring and very silly book where the author has pulled out any and all kinks and put them in a large pile. There is absolutely no storyline and no characters to follow. You get to a point where you just go ""uh huh, so that was the next kink on the list"" and you end up yawning at it all.I can certainly not recommend this book. I always finish any book I`m reading but this had me so bored out of my wits - and with all the sex in it that said something about how poorly it was written - I just couldn`t turn another page."
5,HOT three-way love story!,"And yes, it is a love story...Kate, Joe and Sean are some of the most three-dimensional characters in erotica. You can watch them all gradually come to be in love with one another, whether they're willing to admit it to themselves or not. The bond (and bondage!) these three share is strong enough to survive even the ending, and you find yourself wanting a sequel.As for the smut, it's a must-read for those into m/m and m/f/m sex. There is a lengthy bondage/domination scene and some absolutely fantastic roleplaying that will make you want to dress up for your partner. I preferred the roleplay between Sean and Kate rather than Joe and Kate because it has that much more of a ""forbidden"" factor to it, and the tension between them as they delve into their roles is palpable. The sex is hot as hell between all three characters and you will not be disappointed with this book."
5,One of the best erotic novels out there,"Menage by Emma Holly is one of the best erotic novels I have ever had the pleasure of reading. It combines together scenes of M/W, M/M, M/W/M that would get almost any one in the mood with real charters. You actually get involved in the plot. Some novels there is a loose plot to get you from encounter to encounter but not so in most of Ms. Holly's books."
4,"Great, for the most part.","I did really like this book, on average, but there were holes that got really annoying and I could would have been extreamly more happier with a different ending, but all in all it was a very good book."
1,What a disappointment!,"I had high hopes for this book, but it was just plain boring. In spite of the title, there were only a couple of threesomes in the book, and they both involved the two guys getting busy with each other while ""our heroine"" was kind of an afterthought. The book had a LOT of back-door action, which left me cold, and the sex scenes were really pretty unimaginitive. Also, the constant references to safe sex were irritating -- people read this type of book to escape real life, not be confronted with it! The characters weren't very likable, and the ending was ludicrous. All in all, it's definitely one for the used paperback store."
3,"er, very dirty","I guess I didn't know what to expect from erotica, I thought I'd read one of Emma's previously in All U Can Eat. I enjoyed the other one, this one was a little too much for me. The writing was, as usual, high quality, but the kinky nature of the sex was a little too....well, a little too everything for me. Don't get me wrong, I mostly enjoyed it and finished the book. (When I don't finish, it's a truly bad book.) But after about halfway, I bagan skimming through the over the top sex scenes. Three and a half stars really, if you buy it, I'm sure you'll be entertained, bit it is not a MUST read."
1,"Not ""erotic"" at all!","Webster's dictionary defines erotic as ""arousing sexual feelings or desires"". This book was thus the opposite of erotic for me - it totally turned me off. I did finish it, because I kept hoping it would eventually connect with me, but it never did. Way too much with just the guys and the heroine as an outsider, (...) way too much crude language. Eros would be appalled! My hubby normally looks forward to me finishing an erotic novel, because he gets the benefits of my happy mood. After finishing this one, I just wanted to take a hot shower and forget I ever read it."
1,"hideous, affluence worshipping, tripe","Page after page of loving, raptuous, unimaginative description of how deleriously wonderful it is to be young and have sh** loads of money and no responsibilies. About as engaging, real life, and erotic as a Penthouse photo spread."
3,Not Happy!!!,"I am sure this was a good book, but no where was it listed that this book was written in first person. I do not like books written like that and if I had known this I would not have bought it."
5,Not the same old story!,"I loved this book. So much erotica is either unrealistic or not-kinky, and this is a breath of fresh air! A wonderful romp while remaining something that could indeed happen in the real world, and hot hot hot! I'll be looking for Emma Holly's other stories with enthusiasm!"
5,Best Emma Holly Yet!,"I have read almost all of Emma's books and by far this has got to be the best one yet. The story was wonderfully written, it made you smile laugh and almost cry. The love between the three characters is so engaging and mesmerizing. I have read a few books dealing with menage a trois and none of them affected me like this one, you could relate to all of the characters. I also loved how the story ended, it was just how I would have if I had wrote it.If you have something against f/m/m erotica then you wouldn't like this book but if not I say definetly check this book out because you will not be disappointed. Its a wonderful love story."
4,Great for tailgating,"Used this at the beach and at a concert. Cooked hamburgers and Hotdogs with no problem. Trick to keeping the chamber clean: Line it with aluminum foil....then when you want to put the coals out, pour water, fold up foil, and discard. Easy clean up. Very happy with this purchase"
2,tweed peat moss and everything sordid and brown,"O Seamus, have you no better way of versifying?truly a mess of intricate disorderingsWhy is this clown so popular? Must be the neo-Hibernianism that has--um--""taken root"" so insidiously at many of our nation's finest institutions. If you like earthy tone poems with telegraphed ""wit"" go forth and allow Heaney's snarky charm to plant you on your muddy feet. I prefer something more elevated and sly in its design.Yes, yes, he's a major member of the Canon. I don't dispute his Talent. But how anyone warms to this pint-and-a-plow nonsense is beyond me."
5,Seamus doesn't shame us!,My son loves poetry so I took a chance that he would like this. I was just informed that he thought it was one of the best poetry books he has ever read. He is 28 and has been reading poetry for over a decade. I think I might get a copy for myself.
5,"Heaney's Natural, Witty, Brilliant Poems In One Volume.","Seamus Heaney is a master poet who connects nature, emotion, and even plot, in a brilliant and particularly Irish poetry. These poems are accessible to non-English majors. I read them out loud to my wife at night. They elicit a reaction that begins at emotional imagery, veers into thought, and ends up touching your soul. One of the immortal greats of the English language is writing and publishing now, and this book is indispensable."
2,it's ok...,it's alright...i bought this product when i was just learning ab saw palmetto (i'm using it to try to help with hair loss) and honestly...i don't realy take it anymore because i bought a standardized saw palmetto product from natures bounty and a seprate suppliment of pumpkin seed extract. i take it once in a while for the pygem bark but i'll probablly just buy a seperate suppliment of that as well. personally...i can't comment on the prostate cos i don't have one...i think standardized saw palmetto is better.
1,Checkers isnt a real game,I began reading this book and around page 100 realized..... Who cares about a computer that can play checkers. Checkers isnt a real game the way chess it anyways. Now Deep Blue is an achievement.The evolutionary computation was interesting but come on.... checkers? Why not spend months developing a program that can do something useful... like balance my checkbook.
5,Rookie/Superstar!,"Riley Judd is a super hockey player, but undisciplined and selfish! Tyler Watson is just glad to be on the team. He's definitely not the greatest player and he definitely doesn't play to his full potential. The coach teams them up to help the underpriveledged ADD kids and to help each other. One to look beyond himself and stop showboating and the other to begin to play up to his full potential. Riley and Tyler can't stand each other and that is an understatement! Through helping the kids and unraveling the mystery of the kool-aid tampering, they learn to care for others, do their best, and become really great friends. What a great book."
4,Spalding Pro Image Rim,"Rim seems nice, but I had to return it. The description said ""Multi-fit mounting pattern"" however it only fits two patterns: 2 7/8"" x 2 1/2"" and 3"" x 4"". This is clearly stated in the instructions but was not included in the description."
5,Great price and great quality,Exactly what I thought I was getting. Good quality and very good price. I would recommend it. We are using it for our home made backboard.
4,Good Stuff,"Reasonable delivery time. Arrived in perfect condition. Once I got over how strange this headlamp looked, I quickly made this my 'go to' light for all my low/no light activities. This is a BRIGHT LED headlamp (even the red is bright). The light weight feel seems in contradiction to the sturdy quality feel. It is well engineered, though I would have made the elastic straps a bit longer. The fit for me is a bit snug (which is why I docked a star). I am, however, accostomed to getting headwear that doesn't fit quite right since I have a big mellon. This is, without a doubt, the best headlamp I have ever owned."
1,vapid and shallow,"I expected something a little more complex and deep... the descriptions of the foreign characters are all stereotypical of what Indian people think of them - vapid, shallow, sexually promiscuous, and stupid. Unfortunately, the protagonist in each of the stories meets most of these stereotypes. Descriptions of the Indians fall almost exclusively into the type that is perceived to be ""beautiful and intense"", or the type that wants to scam foreigners. Both of these descriptions too are shallow and lack depth. As an Indian person myself who has spent many years in India as well as the US, I am quite offended at the sterotypes made of the Indians, as well as the foreigners (I know plenty of non-vapid foreigners who have lived in India as expats). For all the years that the cover of the book claimed Maura Moynihan lived in India, she could have written much better stories."
3,I wish she'd included a caution!,"This book deserves _5 stars_ except for ONE THING...Jean George assumes children will realize that you cannot use these techniques with a strange dog. I wish this were true, but as a librarian, I was obligated to write my own disclaimer and glue it in the front endpapers. I adore the book (as does my 7 month old puppy!) and the skills really work (especially the kissy noises on the back of the hand), but I think Jean George kind of blew it by not telling children to NEVER EVER PUT THEIR FACES NEAR A STRANGE DOG!"
2,Bad Advice for Kids!,"I purchased this book for my daughter after we got a new puppy. I was disappointed with the content and illustrations of this book. Almost every page contains a super-imposed photo of the author (a stoutly elderly woman) working with a cartoon dog, demonstrating a training technique. One training technique suggests that a child put his/her face next to the dog's face and touch noses with the dog.This book is a basic book written to show children what a dog's body language means and how children can communicate with their pet using their own body language.I was disappointed in the content, potentially dangerous suggestion to put your face close to a dog's face and rub noses, and the illustrations of this children's book."
1,WARNING: Don't try this at home,"I opened this dog from the library and couldn't believe the bad advice contained. It's like the lady went down the list of things we told the kids not to do, and said ""try them for fun!!""We have a large dog and a small dog. The play rough together chasing, and tackling, and biting. As others have said, a lot of problems occur between dogs and children because dogs will tend to see children as other dogs instead of other humans.They attempt to play with them, and sometimes will try to dominate them as if they are other ""pack mates"".If you stumble upon or god help you purchase this book. Do not let your children attempt any of the ""advice"" without your supervision. My advice is simply throw the book away.It's such a shame to see children's delight with the family pet turn into fear and tears because as Jean George extremely poorly thought out book."
1,WOW. DO NOT LET YOUR CHILD DO THIS!,Some of the advice in this book is just flabbergasting to anyone who knows anything about dog behavior. No child should ever think it's okay to get into a dog's face! That is SO dangerous! Parents be warned: Your children may not know better but to follow some of the crazy advice in this book! Don't take that chance! This book is a recipe to get bitten.
3,"Good book, but assumes too much of children","This book shows young people the joys of communicating with dogs, from how to recognize dog talk through body language to the various ways animals communicate through whimpers, sniffs, and barks. The book, however, assumes that young children will know not to apply these very ""hands-on"" techniques to strange dogs--a very dangerous assumption that could lead to dog bites. The book offers two suggestions that one should never do in front of an aggressive dog: one is to wave a newspaper above the dog's head, the other is to sniff a dog's nose to calm an angry or confused dog down. Children should never be expected to calm an angered or aggressive dog down. While the book has lots of good information on dog behavior that could benefit both children and adults, it lacks the cautionary requirements to keep kids from getting bitten by dogs too."
1,Dangerous Book for Kids,"this book gives terrible advice that will cause a child to be attacked by a dog, their personal dog or a stranger dog. Do not buy this book for your kids. It gives advice on how to show your dog you're the leader by having the child place their mouth on the dogs muzzle or hold their muzzle shut. And teaching kids to say hi to a dog you get nose to nose with them. Absolutely surefire way of having children attacked and seriously injured."
1,How to talk to your dog and tell him to bite you.,I am a qualified dog trainer and would urge anyone thinking of buying this book to think twice. The advice given inside is truly dangerous and any child following the instructions on how to interact with a dog is more than likely going to be bitten. It would be better that none of this advice ever reaches any child.
1,Dangerous - AVOID THIS BOOK!,"Some of the advice offered in this book is wrong. Some of it, though, goes way beyond ""wrong"" and is downright dangerous. It would be very easy for this book to cause a child to be attacked by a frightened dog, whilst from the dog's point of view much of what is recommended is just plain cruel. This is a terrible book. Avoid it."
1,No!,"Oh my goodness. This should be titled, How to get your child bitten in 5 seconds or less. Do not let your child do these things in this book. Check out how to really ""talk"" to your dog at Joan Orr's web site."
3,Not interesting enough for a 4yr old...,"We have 3 dogs, and after reading the reviews I figured this would really entertain my 4 yr old....In reality: not so much. The entire book is mostly text, and it gets a little long-winded at times. My son kept asking me if all the dog talk was for boy-dogs only (seeing the author refers to ""him""/ ""he"" for the dogs throughout the book). Will save this one for a couple of years and see what happens then. Not the best buy in books for sure. Also: I agre with other reviewers that it is VERY IMPORTANT to stress to your child that the tips are for YOUR family-dog(s), and NOT other strange dogs....Shutter to think that someones child might think they can ""talk"" to strange dogs by putting their face up to their nose. Yikes!!"
3,Like yesterday-Youthful Soul,This cd is a nice little track down memory lane with two sister that started out in a group called the Sugababes.The first two tracks are stellars: Wait for me and R.U. available. The rest are just fillers. I wish they would have left most of the production to Chuckii Booker and Bryan Loren.They had a better understanding of the two siters vocalability and how to structure and arrange the music to compliment the voices of Stacye and KimiKO. Though this is their only CD it is a good find to remind us of the sultry yet youthful 90's Girl Duo!
4,EARLY 90'S R&B,"STACYE AND KIMIKO used to apart of girl group THE SUGAR BABES in the late 80's. They returned as a duo with the cd ""PARADISE"". the first single ""WAIT FOR ME"" easily rivals anything JANET JACKSON was putting out at that time. Ironically the girls work with CHUCKII BOOKER(who was touring with JACKSON) on this release. The groovy ""R U AVAILABLE"" and sexy ""COME AND GET IT"" find the girls more than reliable at holding their own. They dont have the strongest voices but they do have good range and could easily rival BRANDY or ASHANTI. Good 90's r&b from a duo who should have gotten more recognition."
3,Doesn't explore the trigger concept to its full extent,"Maybe I am on the wrong wavelength here but the film reminded me somewhat of Pay it Forward, i.e. the way people treat each other can have a profound influence on the world around us. Without giving too much away of the plot of The Trigger Effect it seemed to suggest that while everyone was treating each other badly (from a minor insult, to racial prejudice, to shooting someone dead) the entire world ended up on the path to destruction. But as soon as someone did something good, the trigger effect takes over and the world became a better place.Interesting scenario. A bit simplistically portrayed in my view but an interesting look at what could happen when our society starts to fall apart."
3,A harsh dose of reality,"""The Trigger Effect"" is an honest but painful look at the unstable house of cards our society is built upon. The suburbs are full of anesthetized Americans who think they are safe. This movie cuts through the fallacy of safety we all live under. The illusion of security from police protection, government oversight, some money in the bank or a gun under the mattress are shown to be an insubstantial chimera obscuring the underlying harshness of reality. ""The Trigger Effect"" uses a power failure to graphically demonstrate the inevitable results of the failure of one card in our fragile social system. Not a pleasant movie, but an important one. If you're looking for a linear plot or a strong story line look elsewhere. Recommended viewing for all suburbanites."
2,Great Theme Weak Plot,"At the end of this movie, I was thinking, ""What was the point?""Here is a great idea, good acting and characters. But, some of the story line just made me roll my eyes.O.K. The power goes out in small town, U.S.A. This young couple are lost without their bank machines and credit card purchases. The white-collar husband has to steal medicine for his baby. Along comes his brother-in-law and there is a debate about the primal blue collar worker being better equipped to handle the crisis than the more civilized white collared nice guy with a conscience.After some unrest in the neighborhood, the three adults get this plan to fill their car with gasoline, bring extra and then ""find"" another 7 gallons along the way to one of their relative's homes. They run into mostly nice folk who are getting by and an obnoxious guy trying to rip people off.Don't expect an action movie. It is a slow-moving drama about how people treat each other with or without the disaster."
2,The trigger effect,"I thought it was a waste of time. I really thought it was going to be something special. Not sure what I was expecting, but it was a big dissapointment."
3,Rent it.,"The idea isn't bad at all. Something like that (major blackout, severed supply chains, chaos, looting and shooting) can and most likely will happen again one day (take New Orleans for example). The performance is also quite good (one can actually see regular folks transiting from minor confusion to desperation in a matter of hours). Worth being watched once but rent it if you can since it's not one of those movies that you'd want to make a part of your collection."
3,MacLachlan Soft but a Few Bullets Fly,"As a Kyle MacLachlan freak this film is disappointing in casting him as a spineless husband in the face of fear gaining enough gall to steal medicine for his ailing son once the panic of excommunication sets in. The technological losses and its results are too simplistic, Elisabeth Shue's narrative is irritating rather than eerie, Mulrooney is predictable. Kyle does extreme injustice to himself, but that's my problem. You guys enjoy the violence and chaos that's implied more than demonstrated, and hope you don't have the neighbors they do."
1,Awful movie - stay away.,"I actually went to see this move at a movie theater. This was Elizabeth Shue's first movie following her great performance in ""Leaving Las Vegas,"" so I wanted to give it the benefit of doubt - big mistake. But instead of reviewing the movie itself, here's my contribution: Of about 60 people sitting in the movie theater with us, over 40 people left before the end of the movie and those people - like me - who stayed until the bitter end, were probably all hoping there would be this magical thing, this ""deus ex machina"" experience at the end, that would help us understand the deeper meaning of it all. Wrong. I guess we all wished we would have left with the others - very early in the movie ..."
3,Watch It Twice,"I didn't like it much the first time I saw it, however it seems much better on the second viewing to grasp the meaning of it all. Besides that, not much anything else to say about ""The Trigger Effect"", other than it has many comparisons with ""Strange Days"". I would give it 3 stars on the better 4 star rating scale."
1,Absolutely repulsive,This is one of the worst movies that ever made it to the big screen. It's annoying and frustrating to watch people be so cruel to each other and make such stupid decisions. The film starts with a shot of wolves eating one of their own. What's the point? Is the director trying to send a message that humans are nothing more than animals? The plot is so freaking dumb it's not even worth mentioning. Avoid at all costs.
1,Don't bother.,"I wish I could give this movie a negative ""Star"" rating. This has got to be the MOST stupid movie of all time. It was terrible when it came out on VHS. Wasting money on it in DVD is even worse. You keep waiting for something (ANYTHING) to happen. Several possible plot lines are never explored and when it is finally over you end up asking ""What the heck was that all about?"""
2,A Lightweight,"This book is a lightweight. There isn't much that isn't already covered by the technical analysis classics. If this was the only book I read, I would not feel comfortable playing with real money, with only the knowledge contained in this book. If you really want to learn technical analysis, you can't go wrong with the classics: John Murphy's ""Technical Analysis of the Futures Market"" and Martin Pring's ""Technical Analysis Explained"""
3,Afro-American History-on-Screen,"Four stories produced by Al Christie, producer of early Al Roach, Fatty Arbuckle, and Harold Lloyd comedies, contain the music of Curtis Mosby's Dixieland Blue Flowers and features Spencer Williams (""Andy"" of ""Amos and Andy""). Includes ""Framing of the Shrew,"" ""The Melancholy Dame,"" ""Oft In the Silly Night,"" and ""Music Hath Harms.""Visualised in the middle twenties of the past century, this work is a funny comedy reflecting, probably, popular trends and fashion of a richer white majority rather than a real life of then Afro-Americans actors performed.Music, dancing, and, surely, mimicking of then ""bossy life"" standard/behaviour made this B&W; movie of interest to generations oncoming."
4,24 classic episodes; package is better than season one.,"Finally some extras; 5 episodes have commentary tracks featuring Bob, David Davis and Marcia Wallace, and Jack Riley on one. The commentaries are actually pretty interesting, going into the actors, writers and directors. Marcia mentions a great gag reel; maybe we'll get that in the next package. But sadly Suzanne Pleshette, Peter Bonerz and Bill Daily didn't participate; wonder if they weren't asked or turned it down. The ""making of it"" featurette (end of disc 3) runs 14 minutes and is Bob and David Davis recalling how the show got its start."
4,Brought it up Newhart DVD's to Bob himself!,"I recently met Bob Newhart a few weeks back, asking him when will the rest of the DVD's be available. He said ""he hopes soon"". I said something like we keep on waiting and waiting. I really want to see it after Season 3, that's where it seems it got really good (from what I remember). This is such a crime. I hope they are not waiting til he passes away like John Ritter and then they will flood the market *sighs*"
1,I check for new releases but it will never happen.,"The title sums it up. One of the best shows of the period but why buy only season one? Its been years (literally) since season one came out, for goodness sakes just copy them to DVD and release them!"
3,Nothing against the seller,Bob Newhart has a very dry sense of humor and I don't personally get it. None of the characters really captivate me but this would be a good watch for someone with a dry sense of humor.
2,"Great show, poor technical quality","As others have mentioned, the shows are great, even today.However, the technical quality of these DVDs leaves a lot to be desired. The sound is poor - almost muddy - and is a very low volume. You really have to crank up your volume to hear the dialog. The video quality is about equal to that of a VHS tape on ""EP"" - not very good. The DVDs themselves have no labels on them - just plain silver disks with a tiny label on the innermost band of the disk. Disk three is actually a double sided disk - one side is episodes 17-20, the other side is episodes 21-24. Why couldn't they give you 4 disks instead of three. It just seems so cheap.Hopefully the next season's release will be of a more professional caliber."
3,"Great show, poor technical quality","The Bob Newhart show is one of my all time favorite sitcoms. I could watch the episodes over and over again. Unfortunately the quality of the DVD's are pitiful. I give the show FIVE STARS, but the actual DVD only 1 star. The DVD is plain with a very small label on it. The picture and sound are about the same quality as the video tapes I made myself back in the 80's when I taped the reruns. I feel as though many of these studios producing DVD's of TV reruns don't believe they need to produce anything of quality. Just making the DVD should be good enough for the public. When we love a show we run out and buy the DVD no matter how bad just because we so desperately want to see shows that are not currently being played on TV. I don't know what the answer is because I am guilty of this myself."
5,A cute and funny show.,I miss television like this. This is such a funny and cute show. Everyone will love the Hartley's apt. And their fun neighbor Howard.I could watch this show all day. I love looking at Suzanne's funky 70's wardrobe too.This series is a keeper.
5,Jim McLeans The 8 Step Swing has really helped me.,"This video really helped me get my swing back. I had not felt comfortable with my golf swing for a year. I watched the video and in just days, I'd dropped about 10 strokes (I have to admit I was pretty bad.) But, my swing feels comfortable to me now. It was easy to see the problem when you knew where the club should be and the position your body should be in with each step. When I go back to my old habits, I watch parts of the video again. Another plus was that my husband watched it with me, and his game also improved."
2,My Heart Beats for You,"The writing and production on this release does not do these brothers justice. The only track worth a hoot is ""My Heart Beats for You,"" a soul jam worth the price of admission alone. The youngest one never capitalized on his pipes, which is a shame because he kills it on this track. He soars on the back end of the song.The rest of the album... They cover the Jackson 5's ""I Want You Back,"" which seems to be a requirement for youth groups of the time. That one's good for the curiosity factor, but that's it. The rest of the album is very forgetful... and bad."
3,Far Too Basic,"Other Exam Cram books are pretty good, but this book is the exception. It is far too general and seems copied from help files. The index is limited, e.g. only one reference for global catalog, and the over author's knowledge seemed questionable when he documents requirements for a global catalog and a domain controller (page 17) and fails to realize a global catalog is a domain controller.The quiz questions are far too generic and simplistic, e.g. what tool do you use to enable mailboxes? On the real MCSE exam, they delve into infrastructure design including routing groups vs. Active Directory site, and far reaching questions.I couldn't really recommend this book, especially after being spoiled by official Microsoft material, such the one by Orin Thomas (ISBN 0-7356-2136-5)."
2,Not Up to Usual Ozark Mountain Daredevel Standards,"I agree with what some of the reviewers said, it's different than other OMD recordings, in that they were trying to add a more ""commercial"" sound. Not one really memorable song on here. I usually love at least 3 or 4 songs per CD. Not any that bring me back here."
5,"This is a well-written,beautiful book.","If you're looking for a book with lots of beautiful garden scenes,tablesettings and practical information about the real life ""Alice"" and Victorian lore, look no further. This book is full of the how-to's of tea party planning, including recipes, activities, games and everything you need to know about taking tea. Each chapter is dedicated to either a ""Looking Glass Tea"" i.e. ""Drink Me"" (Tea With The Mad Hatter), ""Painting The Roses Red"" (Tea In The Garden) & ""The Coronation of Queen Alice(A Nursery Tea)or Victorian Teas i.e ""In Honor of St. Valentine"" (A Cupid's Tea),A Midsummer Night(Tea With The Fairies)and ""The Holiday Yuletide""(A Family Tea). These are new ideas for parties based on old-fashioned ways. Definitely a must-read for Alice in Wonderland enthusiasts, or anyone who enjoys staging tea parties for friends and children. This book would also make a great gift for new mothers, tea-totalers, and cookbook collectors.Loved it."
4,Not your everyday surge protector,"I have some pretty expensive stuff plugged into this bad boy. And though it's on the more expensive side it's nice to know that my electronics are protected. I've only had it trip once, thankfully. Given how well it conditions I can only imagine how big that surge or drop must have been."
3,cd,"again another item purchased for my daughter, who loved to collect cartoon stuff. She seemed delighted with it, so I'm pleased"
4,Interesting Religious Observations,"I enjoyed reading this book. The subtle title belies the vast content of the book but certainly befits the wonderful love- story.I learned much about Southeast Asia and the Buddhist religion and, as lifetime Roman Catholic, I strongly admired the author's way of telling the words of the Hail Mary prayer during that frightening scene in the London Huurricane."
2,"Entertaining, if sometimes annoying.","Based primarily in Singapore, Thailand, and London. The book is entertaining, but sometimes annoying, as the author launches into long dissertations to try and empress the reader with his knowledge of swords, art, food, archeology, religion, etc. The title is pretty much of a misnomer. Some of it is a little unbelievable and condescending, such as how he describes durian to his 22 year-old Singaporean girlfriend. Since the novel is apparently based somewhat on Frey's relationship with his wife (according to her posting to a website), he deserves credit for including some events which would outrage most Asian families (especially 15 to 20 years ago when the events may have taken place)."
4,Words that look or sound the same but are not.,"This book is too hard for me but my mother who is an English teacher wanted me to read the part in chapter 5. About words that are spelled alike but sound diferent and words that are spelled diferent and sound the same. Here it is;Read and read (red), lead and lead (led), cow and row, few and sew, feared and heard, cord and word, a gear is queer, no horse is coarse, a stein of wine, my daughter's laughter. There's more; See the sea, meet the meat, break the brake, is there a muscle on a mussel, buy and sigh, often cry, greet the people at the steeple, to curse is worse than a hearse.I think this is a lot of fun with words. Billy"
5,Excellent,This book is a great addition to the art of calligraphy. Full of wonderful inspiring ideas to give your calligraphy project a wow factor - lifts it right out of the ordinary.
3,Current best introductory book on Scheme.,"No book is perfect...but this book is currently the best available for teaching Scheme to undergraduate CS majors. I have used it several times to teach an introductory course on functional programming (CS 257) at the University of New Mexico. It is more appropriate for a low-level course than Abelson and Sussman--most students find it fairly accessible--yet it is comprehensive and doesn't cheat the best students. Unlike some other textbooks, the point of view is almost purely functional. Mutation and state are not covered until advanced chapters. I will continue to use it until something better comes along."
1,There are better alternatives,"This book is a decent effort.However, there are more interesting alternatives.If you are totally new to programming, HTDP ( How to design programs )by Shriram Krishnamurthy , published by MIT press is superb. It is expecially useful if you are using the superb""Dr Scheme"" programming envirnoment.An online version can be read at ...If you have programmed before, either Abelson and Susman'sSICP or Dorai Sitaram's online ""Teach yourself Scheme in fixnumdays"" are both excellent."
2,Bad first language to study in b.a.,The book is badly written and doesn't teach the skills needed for the rest of the degree.
3,"I really enjoyed it, but then I'm weird","I thought this movie was a lot of fun. I enjoy action flicks, though I started to become a bit disenchanted with them because they were so predictable and unrealistic. I think that's what was so good about this movie. It made fun of action flicks while being an action flick. Sadly, I've found that most of my friends didn't care for the movie as much as I did. But I thought it was fun."
5,Lifechanging Book,"This book opened my eyes to the reality of the person of the Holy Spirit. It helped me to also realize that God was more than a ""religion."" That He is alive and loves me, and I should have a relationship with Him and not just ""go to church."" Also one of the most life changing parts came at the end of the book, when the author said I needed to forgive. I that time in my life, I had someone that I hated. God used this book, to heal me and turn this around in my life and restore this relationship, from hate to love. Now, I have written a book about forgiveness, and hope to get it publised real soon."
5,This book rocks!,"This book is also a 'must read' for anyone interested in going deeper in their understanding, application, and appreciation for the third Person of the God-head....the Holy Spirit. Torrey has 'nailed it' theologically, doctrinally, and biblically in this much needed treatise on the Holy Spirit."
2,Unsatisfied!!,"It Was Quick Delivered...But When I Recieved It,It Was Scratched All To Hell,The Dvd Case Was Broken And Taped Up..I Was One Unsatisfied Dude! :|"
3,Reasonably okay,"It's not worth... more than $10. If you pay more than $10, you'll be disappointed. If you pay less (I think I got it for around $5) it's a steal. A really good performance."
4,Unique and Provocative,"A fine, sometimes stunning and haunting, performance which satisfies more after several listenings."
5,4 year old loves this book,"A friends 2-year-old has this book. My granddaughter fell in love with it! I was reluctant to buy this for a 4-year-old, thinking that she already knows her animals. But it has a lot of information for her, beautiful photos, and actually shows the relationships between species, etc. She's now 5 and still pulls it out regularly, wanting to read it together. I highly recommend it. It's a very special book."
2,Inaccurate,I am a coordinator for a Science Museum and wanted to give this book to teachers in a workshop. Unfortunately this book is not totally scientifically correct. There is a lot of information that is inaccurate. It uses a lot of generalizations instead of keeping in mind the many exceptions in the animal kingdom that do not fit the main rules of their species. It also states that dinosaurs are descendants of lizards but research has proven that they were more closely related to birds. The only part of the book that is acceptable is the photographs of animals from around the globe. DK Publishing is usually very accurate with their science information however this time DK Publishing disappointed me.
1,Errors in an Encyclopedia?,"On page 37, at the bottom, this encyclopedia states that an Elk is another name for a Moose. I sent the book back."
3,It is a good rocker that some have dismissed as a poor sell out hair band recording.,"It is a good rocker that some have dismissed as a poor sell out hair band recording.No, it is not a classic but you won't be ashamed by playing it in front of a crowd"
5,A cascade of feelings,Each and every song is a sundry of feelings that by no means can go unanswered! It's like listening to your subconscious in surround sound! It is my favorite CD to date along with my GooGoo Dolls CD. If you ever get a chance to see them live...do it! WOW...what a show!
1,Shame On Facts On File,"There is not a thing wrong with the text of this book. It is well written and informative. The problem is that this book claims to be an updated edition. We've been able to find no changes from the prior edition. In my opinion, this is tantamount to defrauding schools and libraries with limited budgets, not to mention the folks who work hard to pay the taxes. Buy the version that's not updated. You'll get the same product probably for a better price and let Facts On File know that such conduct is not appreciated."
5,A value for money velvet voiced beast,"When I was shopping around for an acoustic/electric guitar, I played many different ones. I played Yamaha, Takamine, Maton, Seagull etc etcSome of these guitars were very expensive, and didn't sound as good as the washburn.I wasn't really worried about price, but I basically fell in love with this guitar after playing it.The sound is superb. That was a key thing for me, after playing literally dozens of guitars, the sound from the Washburn was the sweetest. Add to that the great price, and top quality looks and finish, and you have a sensational guitar and a reasonable price."
4,No case included,The guitar is wonderful. The page I purchased it on had an image of a case. I took it for granted it was included but it is not. I have written the seller asking them to remove the image of the case.
4,A great mix of music,"This is Keiko's 3rd release. I think it is better than her first two. There are some wonderful songs on it, and anyone wishing to obtain lots of her music should definitely buy this CD. I rate it about in the middle group of all of her CDs. I gave it 4 stars, but would like to give it 4 1/2 stars if available. For those only experimenting with her music, half of the songs on the CD, ""The Keiko Matsui Collection"" are from ""No Borders"". So try buying ""Collection"" to get a sample of the best songs from ""Borders""."
4,No Borders,Keiko Matsui's music is relaxing and it takes me on adventures around the world. No other music like Keiko Matsui's music.
2,Keiko Matsui,"I got this CD for a friend as a gift. She likes it but not too crazy about it. Brain Forst, try Full Moon and the Shrine. It's beautiful."
1,"useless, buy Joannopoulos' other book","This book is very costly and not worth either the money or the time you spend reading it. It's a collection of journal articles that you can get free if your institution subscribes to common physics and optics journals. They have added a badly written introduction and conclusion, and there is absolutely no coherent presentation as it jumps from topic to topic in different papers.(Note: I have used the Kids review option because I didnt want to take the trouble of finding my password, signing in ... I am a researcher in the area of nonlinear photonics.)"
3,This is a great Superbowl snack!,"I normally don't eat anything I can't pronounce. This rules out any sort of Hawaaian food - unless, like this product, they give it a pronounceable nickname. It's difficult figuring out how to say ""mochi"", but I'll bet ""Uranus"" rolls right off your tongue. A perfect treat to whip out when you have unexpected company."
2,How did we forget the mostly overly obvious?,"To me communicating with confidence means: subject, verb, satelites(objects)...BUT, here we have Booher give us a laudry list of ""behavioral"" dos and dont's. I felt almost like I was reading commandments. Thou salt not pout!! (really I'm not making that up as that's one of the tips) Probably more suited for a younger audience, as I felt Booher ""talked down"" to me througout. I wish I could find a better book on the subject. This was not it. I felt quite unsatisfied having purchased Communicate with Confidence."
1,RIP OFF,The only thing exciting about the book is the title. I could not wait to get the book and read it. I can't remember being this disappointed in a book - ever. There is nothing of any value in this - just warmed over hyperbole. I am so po'd that I wasted money on this rip off.
3,Background Singers go to the Front,"Typically you get the Soul Sisters putting it together with super harmony; and there's no steps missing with these ladies. I have enjoyed these ladies render background vocals for Anita Baker and Regina Belle. They also bring their classy touch with background arrangements. Perri is in no way done, but are coming from the background to the front."
5,detergent,Excellent detergent with the added touch of Dowmy that guarantees clean wonderful smelling laundry every time.
3,"Smells great, but really messy","I decided to give bulk powder detergent a try.Pros:It smells great. It's a great value for the money. Clothes get clean. The box lasts FOREVER.Cons:It's messy. Gets all over the floor of your laundry room, and then if it gets wet, hello - accident waiting to happen. Sometimes it clumps on your clothing if it doesn't get wet, or you have too much laundry in your washer.The plastic scoop breaks a LOT before you get to the bottom of your box.My opinion? Try the Tide 2x concentrated. Was voted #1 in Consumer Reports for cleaning action and price per load."
2,too much for me...or it would be good for family of 12 people...,it's way too much for me...or it would be good for family of 12 people...
3,Air America movie soundtrack,"I rated this as okay because not all the tunes are by the origional artists. The description is ""various"" artists, which I assumed because this is a mix of hits from the time period. Nothing is as good as origional when it comes to this kind of music in my book and you may find no problem with this soundtrack."
5,confident,"this is the direction et research should be heading. please visit the yahoo club, intergalactic spirituality."
1,"Leave out ""true"" from the title","These ""true tales of positive alien encounters"" have threads of consistency that just don't appear in reported encounters. It is almost as if the author had the thought, ""Hey, how can I get UFO enthusiasts to convert to Christianity? I know! I'll write a book of ""true"" tales where all the aliens tell about God!"" In actuality, people who claim encounters with aliens have such wide ranging experiences that their stories very little commonality.If you have to read this book, buy the used 1 cent version."
4,thank you very much,moderate delivery and it was in good condition. thnk you and i hope for more transactions with this user. thnk you again.
2,Too much dialogue,"What promised to be a battle-heavy trip into the world of comic turned out to be an animated soap opera. While I expected more ""gang wars"" as promised by the title, I found that the bulk of the book is devoted to the stormy relationship between The Spartan and Yavolda. In fact, the entire book is this couple's meetings at several social events, and although the first dinner scene is amusing, the subsequent dinners and weddings drone on and on. The ""witty"" dialogue comes off as trite ( especially since the two love-birds are decked out in super-hero gear ). So call me mean, but two meta-humans casting longing glances over cups of expensive coffee is a step down for the comic world."
1,Blueprint of a Lady,She is much better when she sings Billy Holiday favorites. Most of these songs were never heard of before
3,1. Weak 2. Very Good .. Huh?,"I'm more of a doom/death/black metal fan. I was into theGathering before Anneke joined (they were doomy) and followed along when she did join, because they continued to make interesting music .. even though it was Pop. She is beautiful yes, but more importantly talented. Her range is not really exposed on this DVD, they should release footage from their ""How To Measure A Planet"" tour (newest material/shows may be way too electronic for many rock fans). There are 2 shows represented on this DVD. One at Dynamo, which is clunky and weak. However, the material from the Krakow performance is FAR better and is representative of how they continue to this day - dark and broody yet with moments of upbeat clarity. It helps that they have some material from ""Nighttime Birds"" in the set, a more mature and focused album than the ""debut"" with Anneke."
4,at least the're on dvd,"Far from top quality production but worth having the footage. I saw the Gathering live in a Krakow like environment so this footage was better to me then the Open Aire concert. The packaging says 5.1 sound which is not true. Just cuz the sound is run through each speaker does not make it 5.1! But like I said, its the Gathering and its 12 bucks so come on!"
3,Recomendable,"OK, FIRST, good delivery, faster than expected. RATE for me is 3 because the sound is really awful, nothing to do with Dolby 5.1, and the images are like recorded in early nineties. Their look is like a garage band, ok, ok this is the first video they have, but no production in their look as a hard rock band.In the other hand, Anneke is great, she is an angel, beautiful, her voice is amazing, angelical voice, and sweet to see her in the show. Hearing her in this hard-core context is a new great experience to live.Pretty recommendable to buy this DVD, but do not expect too much about the sound and images."
5,great potty training tool,"We just used this book for the first time on our ""potty training day"" (with the help of Potty Train Your Child in Just One Day). It is really cute for those of you who don't mind singing silly songs to your child. It helped my daughter stay on the potty long enough to have something come out. It was her favorite book of the potty day and I know we will be singing those songs again and again for some time to come until we master this new skill (and of course when child number 2 gets his turn to learn in a year). Great book to have by the potty."
4,Simply and tastefully,"The Excellent product, much not expensive and it is enough modnyy. approaches nearly under any person. This product has booked two my girlfriends and very pleased. I too : ) will always hear...Fly - steeplyAlex"
3,Mikasa Bowls,"The bowls I ordered arrived quickly and intact. The only reason I'm giving 3 stars is that the bowls are of different, lesser quality than my original set. I don't know if that's how the bowls are now made (my set is 10 years old) or if the vendor sells a ""different"" line of Mikasa."
2,Hmmmm!!,"What can I say.This may be a good watch for the common man but not for any true boxing people..Another attempt to sell something, which aint close to the truth.Rocky Marciano was around 180-185 pounds and a very smallish heavyweight.Muhammed Ali was between 210-215 pounds in his prime.Muhammed Ali was much faster and had the footwork to outwork Sonny Liston(easy) and the rest of 60`s best nheavyweights.Its really sad to see that this is just another attempt to get the white man(Marciano) to win over the black man(Ali).Iam white by the way.The same thing happened(almost) to Larry Holmes.When he was on the brink of passing Marciano`s record with 49 victories(or equal it) they gave the fight to Michal Spinks..Its sad that authorites in boxing has this kind of power..Muhammed Ali will in most people`s minds be the greatest heavyweight ever lived.."
3,Still debatable,"A good tape but very ""back room"" and it wasn't very convincing.To put it into perspective Marciano probably would have knocked out Mike Tyson in the first round which shows his enormous power."
5,Simply amazing.,"I am the biggest boxing fan in the world, and I have to say I was delighted by this fight. It was amazing to watch Marciano's ducking and weaving in the ring. While I disagree with the outcome of the DVD, I still enjoyed every minute of the footage and I highly recommend this."
4,The two greatest fighters ever.,"We saw this movie, first run, at the Fremont Theater in Las Vegas. The under card was Allen Funt's ""What do you say to a naked lady"". All together it was a great movie night. We repeated it several days later. Ali, aka Casius Clay was having a lot of trouble with Uncle Sam about not wanting to be a soldier. He appeared in a Candid camera show too. The fight was just as exciting as any championship fight could be. Later I read that they fought 63 2 minute rounds to make the movie. Ali was a little upset over the ending in the movies I saw. They really did beat each other up pretty good. If you haven't seen this you should. Marciano didn't live very long after making it but he'll live on forever now. How's that for a fight that never was? The producers did a wonderful job."
4,Second Opinion,"I have to disagree with Ben Gibbons--Berg's voice is one of the most expressive I've ever heard. Her singing does ample justice to her impressive writing skill. And ""Back in the Saddle"" rivals the Dixie Chicks for pure sass."
4,Good read,"A engrossing chronicle of the anguish and triumphs of doctors on the front lines of the AIDS epidemic. The story goes beyond the medicine and the science to look at the mental, emotional and personal tolls the plague took on caregivers."
5,A book every horse person should read.,"What a pleasure to find this book back in print.I am re-reading it for the first time in years, and am pleased to find it not at all dated, and indeed very relavent.The good Colonel has a gift not only with his horses, but to let us the readers know his horses and his riding technique. He is as instructive and entertaining as any book available. A must read!"
5,Great Texas jazz/country,"It's really hard to describe the late Walter Hyatt. He reminds you of such legendary Texans as Willie Nelson, Guy Glark, Jimmie Dale Gilmore, and Lyle Lovett (who produced this album), though as a vocalist, he has as much in common with Sinatra, Tony Bennett, and Mel Torme in their younger years. This record has been more or less ignored because it lacked a radio-friendly single, but if you like any of the folks I've mentioned above, give it a try. I guarantee you it's a winner."
2,Disappointing,This DVD is actually a compilation of short instructional cuts from various golfers (not all of whom appear to be professionals)who focus on different aspects of the game. It was probably filmed in the mid-1970's and feels dated. Davis Love looks to be about 15 years old in this DVD. I found the instruction marginally useful at best. Look elseware for good golf instruction.
2,Fore: Watch out,"Should have looked here at the reviews first before I purchased the DVD. Learned my lesson the hard way. ""Quick Tips"" is an appropriate title. Far too short film clips without substance. Could have picked up more current information with online video clips.Save your money and hit an extra two buckets of balls."
3,"""Blue Tears by Blue Tears"" 3 out of 5 stars, sounds like a lost Bon Jovi album","I could not get over how much the singer sounds like Jon Bon Jovi in spots, not the whole album but its definitely there. To me this sounds like a cross between a the first three Bon Jovi albums and Def Leppard on a couple of their albums. The chorus parts on some of the tracks have a big time Adrenalize/Hysteria sound. A lot of the songs are strong and there a parts of the album I really like but overall I am not blown away, there are no killer tracks in my opinion. It is worth picking up if you can find a copy and like this type of music."
1,Doesn't meet expecations,"This product claims to fit any size drawer for a desk. However, this is not true, the ""adjustable"" part is the long bar, which if this bar doesn't fit, then the whole product doesn't fit. This product is misleading, so make sure you have a drawer longer than 20 inches, or this bar will not fit."
1,Smead hanging folder frame,"This is from a woman's point of view. This is a horrible product and I would never recommend it. The rail that has the notches....and you are just suppose to be able to break is absolutely ridiculous, I had to take the rails to a neighbor MAN and I thought he would never be able to snap them to the correct length. He ended up having to use a chisel and a hammer to get them off so IT ISN'T EASY TO DO. I still haven't been able to put the frames together. I would NEVER, NEVER buy this product."
4,"Works fine, but not as sturdy as they used to make 'em","Not difficult to cut to size; you just need a couple pair of pliers. A bit flimsy compared to a similar frame I have from about 20 years ago, but still strong enough to do the job. Would buy again. Good price, prompt shipping."
4,Great for the price,Great for the price!!! Was not hard to install and I am not confident with tools or anything. Works perfect
4,worked great for me.,great for putting into a file cabinet that doesn't have them. nicer file cabinets have nicer systems for hanging file hangers but these work great for cheap file cabinets. don't expect them to work well unsupported. would not work well just sitting on top of a desk or anywhere other than in a file drawer.
3,bring a hacksaw for file folder frames,these were just what I wanted and I'm very satisfied... but had to borrow a neighbor's hacksaw to shorten the side rods well past the indented marked areas! Ordered thru Amazon...came quickly!
4,Be aware of need for assembly,"These file folder frames are advertised as easily adjustable to fit various file drawer lengths. While they are adjustable, you need the right tools for this to be considered ""easy"". I didn't have steel cutters handy, and so the adjustment process took some innovation (which involved using a screw-driver as a focal point and hammering the side rail, bending it back and forth until it broke off).Once adjusted to the proper size, however, the frames work as they should. Had I known beforehand about the assembly requirements, I'd give five stars."
3,A struggle,"This product is great for converting old file cabinets with no hanging folder capacity. However, when Smead says that you can ""easily snap the rods to the desired size"", this actually translates to ""you can bend-break the rods with some elbow grease and a vice grip (heavy-duty vice grip pliers)at each pinched interval"".Thought you'd want to know. Also, doing this bends the end of the rod, so you'll also need to use the vice grip again to bend it back into the proper shape."
3,"Good product, but","not ""easy assembly, or ready to use."" I wish I had known it would involve pliers ( those that can cut ) to make them fit the cabinets. Fortunately I had a set handy, but again, need a fair amount of strength to make the cut to allow these to work in standard cabinets."
5,Not a Problem with the fit,This is a Smead product that fits perfectly in my HON 2 drawer file cabinets. I bought 2 boxes with 2 frames in each box for a fraction of the co$t that one file hanger would have been had I purchased it from my local Office Depot or even WalMart. The quality of this product is every bit as good if not better. Breaking the hanger sides down to fit was not difficult. Just use a straight edge to bend (up & down several times to break it) at the preferred mark for the length size of the drawer. The only tool I used was a flat blade screw driver to tighten down the side runners to the front and back stand. Easy Peasy!
3,"Warning--only for drawers 23"" to 27"" in length","While it is true that you can adjust the length, the pre-crimped tabs that you can snap off only allow you to adjust between 23 and 27 inches. In theory you can make it shorter if you feel handy, but you'll need some tools to do so. I used a pair of wire cutters to make my own crimp at the correct length and snap the rail off, so it did end up working, but the manner that I adjusted the length was not the way the manufacturer intended. While most commercial filing cabinets meet the longer length, the inexpensive ones (like mine) that you get at discount stores are on the order of 18"" deep. The end pieces in my package were also a little bent so the finished assembly wanted to sit crooked in the file cabinet. In the end it worked fine, but left me a little unimpressed."
4,It's true,"A basic, solid steel frame that you are able to shorten. But you'll need a strong clasping tool and a lot of strength to 'snap' off the excess. The frame was too long for my drawer (oops I didn't take measurements). But Amazon processed my return, gave me a refund AND allowed me to keep the item for being a valued customer. Great customer service. Go amazon."
1,Never buy one of these,"This is an absolute piece of junk. I would score it with MINUS stars if I could. I purchased one for my wife for Christmas, 2006 and shortly afterwards, it stopped working. My wife sent it in for repair at our expense, and it has already stopped working again. To add insult to injury, Audiovox now insists that we pay for repairs, and this is only April.I will NEVER buy an Audiovox product again.Bill Katz"
4,Cute,This makes a good gift and a nice way to introduce some of the concepts in a cute way. Look at the size it was smaller than I thought.
4,"Set 'em up, lads!","From their introduction to us in the folk revival of the early '60's, the Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem remain unique. Their moving and rousing Irish ballads, rebel songs and slow tunes fill you with an instant energy. You don't have to be Irish to enjoy this spirit. With the recent passing of Paddy Clancy, I've become even more appreciative of their work. This video captures their reunion concert in Northern Ireland. From ""Brennan on the Moor"" to ""Wild Rover"" to the beautiful ""Go, Lassie, Go"", the Clancy's put on an outstanding performance. There will never be anything like them again."
3,Strange sound mix hurts video,"Based on the utterly sublime Reunion CD, I was expecting this video to blow me away. It didn't. The performances aren't as energetic as the album, and something was wrong with the concert sound, since the video has no songs with Tom Clancy singing lead, and in fact I couldn't hear him at all in the mix."
5,Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem reunion DVD,"If you enjoy the Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem, this will be right up you alley. I have enjoyed this group for decades and this fits right in."
1,horrible,"there is distortion even when the volume is at a pretty low level. the built-in volume control is easy to brush against, and accidentally turn it painfully high. these are awful headphones."
1,awful,"and i unfortunately bought them as a final sale. the sound quality is horrible - everything sounds like it's in a tunnel. i'm really very disappointed, and even more so that i can't return them and now have to spend additional money on a new pair. argh."
5,great irish music,Excellent VHS the tape was in wonderful condition. Sure will be back to order items at a later date.
2,"Good material, average voice, annoying style","This singer is very puzzling to me. Some of his songs are simply wonderful, which prompted me to look for more only to find many of them are just horrible. I suspect that the songs that I find great were somehow enhanced by studio techniques because in this DVD his live voice sounds very average. In addition his effeminate style is so annoying and I really think this singer is better heard than seen.Still I like his choice of material. This kind of light, simple, sweet music is almost no longer sung by comtemporary artists. For that reason alone I'll probably continue to watch his music hoping to pick out something I can enjoy."
4,kickin!,"Great album - love the noise drenched guitar sound and the high energy drumming. I'm trying to think of something to compare this to... maybe a little like Royal Trux, but higher energy. Also, I like female vocalists that can convey intensity without getting screechy. Recommended."
2,DONT BE FOOLED,"Outside of Hong Kong (Thailand, excetera) there are tons of VERY LOW budget movie studios. Basically, to save money, they take stock footage from Hong Kong films (since the fights are the most exspensive and time consuming to film) cut it down, and edit them into thier own cruddy productions. Case in point, Slave of the Sword's fights are taken from Butterfy,Comet,and Sword (aka. Butterfly and Sword). Butterfly,Comet,and Sword is great, but Slave of the Sword stinks. The only thing it offers is a creepy love scene in wich a dog barks in slow motion, while rivers of blood are superimposed across tha couple bonking, and some screeching music plays in the background. But, even that cant save this cheapie."
4,Unique children's book (that adults would also enjoy),"I really like John Irving's writing and have all of his books!This one sounded really interesting and I was curious whether it would work for both adults and children. I found that this book could entertain both adults and children and was written in a way that was at a child's level, but not talking down to them. It was realistic as well as creative and a unique style of writing for a children's book."
4,Unknowns hit paydirt,"Not your overly hyped up hair band, Trixter busted thru with their self-titled album. The headline song ""Surrender"" was a beautiful song, using passion and love to remind people just how precious love is. The youth anthem ""Only Young Once"" (my persoanl favorite), didn't receive the same amount of airtime, but was more well known among fans. These songs are great and the album is just as powerful."
5,ONE OF THE GREATEST HARD ROCK BANDS EVER,"TRIXTER IS BY FAR ONE OF THE GREATEST HARD ROCK BANDS EVER . THERE ARE NO BAD SONGS ON THIS CD . AMONG MY PERSONAL FAVORITES INCLUDE , HEART OF STEEL , ONLY YOUNG ONCE, RIDE THE WHIP , AND THEIR #1 HIT GIVE IT TO ME GOOD . IT IS A MUST-HAVE FOR ANY HARD ROCK MUSIC FAN'S COLLECTION."
4,good cd from a group young guys,Considering how young these guys were when this cd came out it really is a very good cd. A good collection of music i compare them to the like of Firehouse. This is simply a a nice cd from guys barely out of high school. The version of One In A Million on the cd seems a little different then the one i heard on the radio. Does anyone know if there is 2 versions of this song?
5,CATCHY & FUN! The way rock 'n' ROLL was MEANT to be!,"A ""reviewer"" below uses Trixter and similar bands as a reason as to why grunge ""killed"" off melodic hard rock. Well, unlike grunge, at least it wasn't killed off by girl and boy bands like The Spice Girls and Hanson etc. etc. Grunge lasted what, 3, 4 years! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!HAVE A GOOD ONE!P.S.: LONG LIVE REAL ROCK 'N' ROLL!!"
3,more kiddie pretty boy rock,"here again we have what i considered good when it came out, and it's still ok to stroll down memory lane with, but come on.....""Give it to me good""?Oh the humanity. Shameless."
2,Bubble gum rock at it's best!,"This is just a post teen so called ""Pop Metal Band"". If you are a fan of Justin Bieber and Taylor Swift, this should be right up your alley. A bon Jovi spin off you might say. I saw this band open up for the Scorpions. I don't know what was a worse concert combo . . . . this show, or seeing Queensryche and Suicidal Tendacies together. Just so you know, both the Scorpions and Queensryche rocked!"
1,Truly awful album,"Let me say this:This album, like all glam rock, is repetitive, cheesy, boring-as-hell, and frankly, not metal.This album is repetitive in the fact that all the songs sound the same, alongside the fact that both the artwork and songs are super-cheesy.Also, this album is SOOOOOOOOO (I can't stress that enough) boring (so I could make an informed review, not because I liked it) and almost fell asleep. Every song is so boring and repetitive.Overall: This album gets 1 star because it is boring, repetitive, cheesy"
1,"Silly rabbit, Trixter's for kids!","What a load of manure Trixter was. No wonder bands like Nirvana wiped them clean from the earth - and thank God they did.For those that actually dig this album, you might check out the Bullet Boys, another loser band that went bankrupt.HAVE A GOOD ONE!!"
1,Starts of slow and whiney then turns into a real stinker,Detective Eleanor Wyman (Shawna Erickson) sits up all night while we have to listen to that same independent film type of sound track play over and over and over. She is trying to find out what happened to Jack's wife and child that have mysteriously disappeared. The dialog is more stilted than an old Badge 714 TV program. In the process people exchange places and personalities. Only the cat seems to be sane in the movie until it meets an untimely demise (the horror part).Screen play by Serge Rodnunsky; where Edgar Alan Poe comes into play is anybody's guess.If you do not have a fast forward device I suggest you go out for a while and let the movie play to an empty room.
1,"""incremental"" means repetitive","A textbook that uses a ""drill and kill"" approach to math -- killing interest, that is. Saxon is a disaster of mindless busy work over learning. This slow-moving book is based on repetition, euphemistically referred to as ""spiraling"" back. We do not recommend it."
5,Watch the show!,"Nikita needs another person reviewing, like it needs another plot twist. Everyone else has said what needs saying. Watch the damn show! Yes, it is that good."
4,Guilty Pleasure,"I am definitely not in the target demographic for this series, but I had liked the character of ""Nikita"" in its previous incarnations, so I decided to take a look at the pilot. To be honest, I had expected that ""Nikita"" would turn out to be just another piece of CW fluff. Instead, I was rather pleasantly surprised. The writing is good, although a bit delusional in a teen-age fantasy sort of way. The cast is very strong, however, and even when I am not entirely enamored of the plot, I find that half-way through the story I still want to stick around to discover how things turn out,and to root for my favorite bad guy, Xander Berkeley. This version of ""Nikita"" is not as paranoid delusional as the Peta Wilson version, or especially the two films on the subject (""La Femme Nikita"" and ""Point of No Return""), but it's fun and engaging, and that's more than you can say about 99 percent of what passes for scripted television, these days."
1,Fantasy girl-warrior nonsense,"We just watched the pilot and quit about halfway through that. The trick-young-pretty-boys/girls-into-being-assassins premise is stupid, plus the idea of a 90-pound girl twisting/breaking the neck of a 200-pound man is on a likelihood scale of pigs not only flying but doing so backwards. I don't deny there are tough, battle-ready women out there, but why is Hollywood so intent on pretending they're equal to bigger, burlier men? I've read other reviews that this show doesn't get watched much; maybe it's because the suspension of disbelief factor is too heavy on the disbelief. (By the way, for the record, this was K. Jordan, not R. Jordan, who wrote this comment.)"
3,Nikita Kicks,"No pun intended-ha! Loved the preview; albeit short, Amazon's streaming sucks, at least it did for us."
1,Why is there a market for this?,"This series is stylish in many ways - obvioulsy not cheap and the acting is ok. The editing and picture quality even better.But yet another show with some man-killing ""heroine""? Really? We have seen it all before - in Kill Bill, Dark Angel, Bionic Woman, Salt, Charlies Angels, Buffy for the younger audience... I could go on and on. This is just a new packaging.A sexy strong female where the plot just serves as an excuse for her to finish off less strong men (hundreds of them). It is actually very feministic and misandrist in that sense. Doesn`t work for me. I value men."
2,hoax!,"The only real reason that is valid to see this crapy show is, of course to see the legs (and indeed the rest of the anatomy) of the incomparable Maggie Q. But other than that is a copy (and a very bad one) of the unique concept and develeopment of the 90's show La Femme Nikita ... do not waste your money. If you want to see Maggie Q, rent Die Hard 4.0 or Mission Impossible III."
4,More than meets the eye (candy),"I saw that this series had just one review, and it wasn't a great one. So I had to chip in. I watched this on Netflix before getting Amzn prime. Really enjoyed it. Sure, it's no 24, Lost, or even Prison Break. BUT it's only a half-step below. Nikita is fairly well written, decent action sequences, got some atmosphere and suspense AND you can view it HD on Amazon. Wish I had waited!"
4,Nikita reboot,"This show is pretty good. I was skeptical about it, considering some of the shows being aired on the same channel, but I was pleasantly surprised. You won't get mind blowing action like Bourne Identity, but overall the action is great. I occasionally have the urge for a good spy story, and this fit the bill nicely.The acting is ok. It can be a little dramatic at times, but this show is fun to watch, so I can easily overlook the sometimes cheesy acting.Probably the most unbelievable thing is that Maggie Q is supposed to be super tough, but she's so skinny! Otherwise, she's great, and works well as Nikita."
2,Meh,"I wanted to give this show a shot, I thought it could be good. But it's too dramatic, to the point of being ridiculous. And the acting really isn't all that great."
1,Could be worst,"Completely dissatisfied with this new show. Shane West is awful. Maggie is passable, but not convincing as a kick ass spy, don't care if she does her own stunts she have a very fragile appearance. It does have nice effects, but I don't see chemistry and acting is really mediocre. Let's see it may pick up for the second season, but their ratings are very low anyway."
2,Show is only a wanna be show,"I bought this show based on the great rating here on Amazon. How could that many people be wrong? This show is best described as ""total crap done extremely well"". It is a wannabe show. It wants to be ""Dark Angel"" but doesn't have Cameron. It wants to be ""Dollhouse"" but doesn't have Whedon. The production value is very high, but strip all the hoopla away and the dialogue is predictable, mundane, and high-school.Without the Alex character (I could watch Fonseca knit for an hour and not get bored), I would not have gotten as far through it as I did. Thus the 2nd star. In the end, I could stand no more and put it back on the shelf before finishing the season. The only other TV show I've done that with is ""Miracles"".Maggie Q is like Demi Moore in G.I. Jane -- simply not physically believable in the role. If she's so bad-ass that the most well-trained hoods in the world fall before her like dominos, she ought not to have the build of a runway model. Just sayin'."
1,Major Dissappointment,"I was a big La Femme Nikita fan so looked forward to the opening of this series. I was greatly disappointed. To be fair, I only watched the first couple of shows so maybe it improved. They should have given it a different name so that expectations would not have been so high."
5,"Surprised, and in a good way","I really enjoyed this show's first season. I wasn't sure that I'd be able to, as I was a BIG fan of the Le Femme Nikita show featuring Peta Wilson. That said, I thought they did a great job here, keeping things tense, killing characters unexpectedly, and generally keeping the audience guessing. Maggie Q is pretty amazing, and the rest of the cast does their part. Recommended."
3,Good Deal,Was Delivered fast. Very inexpensive for an entire series of a network t.v. show. Only problem was that there were were a few episodes where the dvd froze. thought is was dvd players fault but did the same thing at the same time on my laptop.
3,Deer Stag Dress Shoes,"I really liked the looks of the shoes as advertised and when I saw them. They were bought for a special occasion and they served their purpose. The reason for the 3 stars is that the shoes were extremely stiff. My little guy has a very high arch and a plump foot. I had to find thin dress socks and use a slipper spoon just so he could get them on. After he got them on, they were fine and looked great. I would not have kept them if he was not comfortable with them on. Maybe after wearing them and breaking them in and if it were his only pair of shoes, they would slip on better. But when you go for a pair of shoes and you know you are going to have trouble getting them on, you just choose another pair."
1,HATED IT!,"Echoing the sentiments of so many reviewers, I am COMPLETELY disappointed.I bought this season specifically because I have not seen the Vanessa Williams paraody of SAVE THE BEST FOR LAST since it aired back in the fall of 1992. I was quite excited to finally have it at my access, right!? WRONG!Despite the fact that they mislead you by posting a pic of Kim Wayans as Vanessa on the DVD cover, that clip is NOWHERE TO BE FOUND on this set. Neither are any of the other music clips.The edit makes the set a RIP-OFFThis will be my first and LAST purchase of any of the IN LOVING COLOR dvds. I am satisfied, from this point, to just watch them in syndication."
4,Happy except it doesn't have Joe Jackson's Lock You in the Closet.,I loved it. I just wish it would've had the parody Lock You in the Closet by Joe Jackson.
2,Homie dont play that,"Im pissed off. In living color was my childhood. in many ways watching this show makes me relive my past. But i can remeber so much more. So much more. Is there a reason, is my memoery playing games with me. NO. This is not in living color. This is In living color with no soul. The music has been changed into Techno rap that seems just strange. In living color was known breaking Hip Hop into the mainstream. But those great songs are gone. I asked myself the fly girls seem lame. its not the fly girls its the music thier dancing to. Where are all the music Videos Shabba ranks Mr Ugly man,, vanillia ice. Only thing ive seen is Mc hammer. Why are they palying with us. i dont care if i have to buy another set just give me those Videos and lost skits. Please."
1,***,"i really dont understand how people find this show funny. maybe back in the day it was something hot, but now its not."
1,Show itself is good but...,"Like I said, the show is good but Fox cut sketches which did parodies of music. Such as the Brady Bunch theme for a Michael Jackson/Jackson Family Sketch. And a funny send up of ""Black and White"" in which Jackson sings questioning if he is Black or White to that famous tune. Disappointing that Fox would do this. I would think most people would pay extra for the complete shows as they were originally aired."
2,i don't agree !,i don't agree with anyone who thinks this season is awesome. most of the skits are only 15 minutes in length. once again cheap fox won't buy the music rights. there is sections (i think) that have been either doctored or just cut out. you'll be watching an episode and you'll see the screen mismatch up for a brief moment. you'll think it's your eyes but it's not. thank you fox for butchering all of the seasons of in living color. even though my review isn't that great i still believe that in living color was and is one of the best sketch comedy series on t.v. so they're all still worth buying.
3,The beginning of the end,"Kinda dissappointing after the first 3 seasons. But it's not so much the fault of the Wayans. Fox censors really started cracking down on them and the skits became more homoginized. This was Keenan's brainchild and he could no longer persue his vision of what the show could be. So, he and Damon basically jumped ship to persue bigger and better interests. Kim and Shawn stayed on a while as well as Jim Carrey and David Allen Grier. I think season 4 also had the last new ""Men on...."" with men on fitness, which was a scream. And a new Fire Marshall Bill handling the LA riots. Other than that, and the addition of the newest Fly Girl Lisa, the season is lackluster with no focus and no camaraderie. It's a shame that ""The Man"" had to kill this show."
1,Awful!,"The 4th season is terrible. You can tell that once Keenan and Marlon left, the sketches went down hill. Most were almost a train wreck with no clear direction. Don't waste your money on this DVD."
5,Still Funny,"I loved the show when it first aired, and I love it just as much now. It's just as funny as I remember it."
1,DON'T BUY - JEWELRY IS FAKE FAKE FAKE!!!!,"It would be my suggestion to those of you looking for jewelry on Amazon to NOT buy from Peora....they falsely advertise that their jewelry is ""sterling silver""....but it is in fact NOT. I passed over several rings that I really liked because they were only ""sterling silver plated"" and not actual silver, the one I chose was supposed to be REAL silver (not plated), but the first time I cleaned it with jewelry cleaner, *specially made for sterling silver*, it turned and is now PERMANENTLY tarnished. Unfortunately for me I was out of town at the time and was not able to send the item back, and I am now stuck w/ a birthstone ring that is FAKE!! I am extremely disappointed and if I could have given NO STARS, I would have!!"
3,Why are these quartets so underplayed?,"It's hard to make Muzak out of late Beethoven, but the Hagens seem determined to smooth out all of the composer's most jagged, daring and risky ideas. Every movement here is underplayed, which came as quite a surprise to me. I had associated the Hagen Qt. with edgy, self-conscious, often aggressive interpretations. Here they merrily zip along the surface -- listen to the brief Alla marcia fourth movement of Op. 132 -- in a way that even the fleet, modernist Emerson Qt. doesn't.Perhaps the intent was to make Beethoven sound more ""classical,"" a category his late works hardly fit into. One expects maximum intensity in the Adagio of Op. 132, but to the Hagens Beethoven's great hymn of praise is a pastoral stroll. Everyone's entitled to their opinion about Beethoven style nowadays, but to my ears these readings come dangerously close to trivialization."
2,this is perhaps what happens when you think you are better than you are,"Just heard this Op 127 of theirs, and Lord, how rushed, and consequently inept, some of the playing sounds in the important moments. Esp the last movement. (Ensemble, intonation, attacks, clarity, etc. etc.)If you are going to try and be interpretatively serious about these tempi, then you gotta practice a lot more than they have, evidently. Very weird, and with so much competition!Now, it is not *that* rushed, so the bottom line may be that the Hagen simply are not technically quite competitive with the best of their peers, and they perhaps do not realize we are in a Golden Age of quartet playing.Much lovely and astute playing elsewhere and momentarily throughout, but to smear / smoosh the loud high-drama congested moments settles it for me."
3,Great music but not for the absolute beginner....,"This is one of several books/DVD/CD sets I purchased to attempt to learn how to play.... John is an awesome player and I think any intermediate player would benefit greatly from this DVD but for me it was pretty confusing...John would play a piece and then would say rewind and play again until I got it... I was left to picking notes to try and match the music and it was not very efficient... Finally found Madeline's book (offered as a set with this DVD)which showed which strings I needed to hit and everything clicked... If you are an absolute beginner, purchase the set and start with Madeline's book first... You won't be sorry...."
1,Don't Wast Your Money,"DVD-Hammer Dulcimer-A Comprehensive Beginner's CourseI was very disappointed in this video. First, its about twenty years old and a poor transfer from VHS tape to DVD. Everything he teaches you about the basics of owning a dulcimer, you most likely already know. There was one interesting tidbit on quickly tuning the instrument. The remainder of the DVD is supposed to teach you how to play a few songs, but the learning methodology is terrible. You watch him play the song and then he tells you to keep rewinding the tape (DVD) to learn the song. Not only is this not an easy way to learn a song, but it is difficult to see where he is on the notes because of the poor quality of the video and his antiquated instrument.I also bought the Mel Bay book and CD which was much more helpful at teaching me to play."
4,A REALLYY enjoyable western!!!,"4.5 STARS. A truly kind male, who also happens to be quite a stallion, who is also tender. A truly loveable heroine, tough, stubborn, passionate.I love western era romance novels. This was a great one. Yes, a marriage of convienance, done before, but a good premise leading up to it.This book deals with prejudices, passion, children, all without being too heavy.Lonely hearts finding love, great scenes of passionate love-making, not just sex. Loved those.What it lacked for me was the happy-ever-after epilogue including the children. But other than that it was a thouroughly enjoyable read."
5,Lonewolf's Woman,"Wow, what a great reading experience. I loved your description of the characters and the area..the way you describe how they had to live with such prejudice! Really enjoyed this book.."
3,A good read,"This was a good enough read, steamy and romantic, just what I look for when purchasing a romance novel.I'm not giving it more than 3 stars though because even if I enjoyed the read I can't say much more about it than I liked it."
1,This Video Is Age Inappropriate!,"This video is to say the least, very least, is plain old stupid. A majority of the children in the video are well over the age of five years old, participating in poor dance routines that really have nothing at all to do with the potty, and at time dancing somewhat provocatively. The tape is way too upbeat in order to get down to business. The child will want to get up and dance instead of sit down on the potty. I agree with a prior review though... My jaw almost hit the floor when I heard the song ""Hottie For The Potty"". How inappropriate can a child's tape get? I am embarrassed that someone would even produce this tape and had I not purchased it on ebay, I would return it. This a is a poor tape for potty training. I would recommend Once Upon A Potty or Potty Power. They are excellent and have actual toddlers using the toilet with no lewd lyrics. ."
4,Worth a shot if you have tried everything else and didn't work!,"We used this DVD for our boy and girl and they loved it! It probably didn't work straight away but if parents expect results straight away, well that is a bit naive. I found that this video helped my children to get into the habits (e.g. the monkey washing hands etc) and they also learnt other things by repetition watching this video over and over again until I was sick of it!!I think it was a good purchaseIf you are pretty desperate and have tried everything, you might want to give it a go"
4,Great DVD!,This is a must have video. If you are have a hard time with potty train get this on. My son loves this video. After a week of watching he started telling he has to go. we play the video very day.Thanks!
4,Catchy,"We bought this to help toilet train my daughter who has special needs. She loves music and we thought this might help. She loves to watch and dance along to the songs (be careful, you will find yourself singing the songs in the middle of the night)So far a watching hit, but we've only had it for a few weeks."
5,Gotta Get this Video,"We've been struggling with getting our developmentally delayed son potty trained. Finally, my husband and I decided to combine a few systems. We purchased a potty training system and doll and bought two videos to accompany the one we already owned. My son loves singing and watching this video (as does our 14 month old daughter). I've heard my son on the potty singing ""Do the Potty Dance"" at a loud level and smiled several times. He has responded well and wants to potty now. He had a lot of anxiety before and didn't even want to sit on the potty before. Now he sits and eliminates, which is huge!"
1,Pretty bad,"I got this DVD for my daughter and I was not impressed at all. It didn't seem to have any point to it, and honestly I don't know how this is supposed to help with potty training. I would definitely not recommend this DVD."
5,Best toddler video we've seen!,"My son was completely not interested in going to the potty, and at 28 months old we were beginning to get concerned. We purchased I GOTTA GO! and his interest in the potty (as well as correctly using it) skyrocketed after the first time he saw the video! It's been 2 weeks now and my son is completely potty trained! He still loves watching I GOTTA GO everyday (as do my husband and I). Besides being a fantastic potty training video - its a great video for building confidence and feeling great about being a toddler! Would recommend to everyone!"
1,Embarassingly awful!,"It's a just a bunch of hyperactive music videos! Way too many wannabe child stars running around, with bad rapid-fire editing and cheesy video effects. The song ""Hottie for the Potty"" is just plain creepy. Do you really want your toddler to be a ""Hottie""? How about a ""Cutie for the Commode""? Or a ""Tease for the Toilet"" or a ""Babe for the Bathroom""? What are the producers of this video thinking? The lyrics might be clever for an adult to listen to, but are way too mature for a 3 or 4 year old to make sense of. Too spastic. Too hyper. The video had no instructions about how to actually go to the potty!I watched the whole video, to see if it was going to be useful, but my little guy totally lost interest in it after about five minutes. I would recommend ""Once Upon a Potty,"" without hesitation, however. Nice story, with nice babies sitting on potties, friendly and frank instructions, told in a calm manner, on how to use the potty in language that toddlers can understand.(...)"
4,Potty Pusher Video,"This DVD was a real big help when it came to potty training my son. He would fuss & fight when I wanted him to go on the potty. But he watched ""I Gotta Go"" and for the first time something finally helped push him to be want to use the potty. We are still working on it, but he loves to immitate the monkey using the potty, washing his hands, and that now he's a big boy because he goes on the potty. He really likes the songs and the music has been a big push for him, at least something is finally working."
1,Vicki find a new line of work,"As a parent and consumer I couldn't believe how bad this video was. I think Vicki--the president has very little idea about children--but likes to dabble in marketing. I heard Vicki talking this up on a radio interview and bought it just for fun...as she made it sound great. But, that's it--no--not a good product...not useful for parents. Just another marketing ploy! Oh and such an original title...there are half a dozen potty training books with the same name. I'de go with those instead! Just remember lots of praise and patience and a positive attitude! They will get it!"
2,Just ok,"I got this dvd as we are starting to work on potty training with our daughter. I would say it's just ok. Nothing really special about it. My daughter didn't really want to watch it, but she likes more interactive things. This was kind of too much of the same thing. Just one music video after the other--all pretty much the same. Maybe other kids would like this, but my daughter got bored very quickly and lost interest. The doctor at the end tells pretty much standard information. That's about all there is to the dvd."
2,not very impressed,"After reading all of the reviews on Amazon regarding this product. Even though there were more than a few very negative ones I decided to purchase the product for my daughter. Since there were some very good reviews as well. Unfortunately I wish I would have taken the negative reviews more seriously. I was pretty disappointed with the quality of the product. My daughter didn't take to it at all. It just seemed to wind her up and then she lost interest. I think the music may be a little too much. It's pretty fast paced, and just keeps going and going and going. I like to keep an open mind with these things, but this really didn't do it for us. I'm sure we'll find something or maybe she'll be potty trained while we look for something better!"
1,"I gotta go, no","I did not like this video and neither did my children. The quality looked poor, almost like a home video. My 2 year old that we are potty training would not watch it."
2,Centers on a negative concept,"If you buy this tape, make sure it is just ONE of the items in your potty training basket. It's useful but very limited and is centered on the negative concept of ""babies wear diapers but BIG kids don't"" My little guy still enjoys being babied, and the repeated message that babies wear diapers and big kids just don't is not a message that he identifies with as, to him, it means leaving all elements of babyhood behind and moving into some weird new ""big kid"" world.The video is a compilation of songs with kids dancing or running to the potty. It teaches some useful concepts like pulling up and pulling down pants but for a more kid friendly video I recommend Bear in the Big Blue House's potty training episode."
1,zero would be a better rating,If there were a rating of zero stars I would have definitely used that rating. This is a ridiculous product. I showed it to 4 sets of parents after they read the back of the tape where it promises that your child will be potty trained easily. They all hated it. By the way I've been a preschool teacher for 15 years. I don't think this company did their homework on what works with young children. I would definitely tell you to buy Bear in the Big Blue house instead or even Once upon a potty. Both products blow this one away!
1,Give me a break,"This message is to Toni---who should know that people are entitled to their own opinion and maybe you shouldn't be so judgemental. I wish I would have read the inferred e-mail because I was very unimpressed with ""I Gotta Go!"". It was very repetitive. Kids dancing around very little actual potty stuff and no instruction. My child will be potty trained...I have no doubt about that, but I don't think this tape will help in any way. Maybe your the one who should GET A LIFE Toni---going back and forth to this site to bash someone elses thoughts...you may want to take a look at your behavior."
4,Wonderful collection,"A fabulous collection of the Chess Recordings including some unreleased material. I have only one beef and that is the liner notes or the lack of them. The set I have shows only the Song Titles and the recording year. At the very least I want to know the other players, and I suspect that should have been easy to supply."
2,not a good quality sound,This is old Muddy music. Quality sounds ancient and I would not buy again. Save your money on this one.
3,Incomplete,"Attempting to capture the complexity and diversity of this artist in ONE box set is doomed to be both troublesome and very incomplete.IT SIMPLY CANNOT BE DONE.Muddy Waters displays his command of the Blues in songs such as ""I Can't Be Satisfied"" and ""Long Distance Call"". Rarities like ""Mean Red Spider"" are pleasing to find.Overall, the collection is a good start for someone who just wants to hear his laments and joys in one fell swoop. Die-hard fans should avoid this and stick to the released LP/CD."
4,maze live in los angeles,this was a great buy if you like maze i think this is one of their best performances sound and picture quality are great
5,Good DVD!,Great DVD! The songs were the songs I wanted to hear! Maze still sound just as good as they did then! Brought back some good ole memories!
5,GREAT,"Thanks to large screen televisions, I felt as though I was actually at the concert...front row. The clearity of the tape was GREAT."
3,Just Okay,"The DVD is okay, songs are short it's a brief snap of a few good songs and it's over. I would not buy it for a gift and the price should have been much lower."
5,A must have!!!,"If you are a true Maze fan, you will definitely want this for your collection! It is the next best thing to being at the concert!"
4,Snuff,"A good take on a shockumentary, the quality is as if they took the video straight from VHS source, watchable and entertaining, much of the footage is not new in the eyes of a gore hound, but there are a few good tidbits that you could say are rarely seen even on the internet like a cat getting mauled by 100's of mice as to name one. Overall an interesting watch.*Note: In the 90's when this video was first released it was named Snuff Video: Volume Red"
2,A simple guideline book!,"I was dispointed for this book. A lot of interview questions, but only very few analysis.I don't recommend this book to anyone."
1,It is only a general guidebook for manager!,This is a very simple guidebook for manager. Only very few simple analysis you can expect to study. I don't recommend this book to anybody.
4,Moral Theology in the Anglican Tradition,"Stephen Holmgren's book is really a discussion on how to live a Christian life in the Anglican tradition. The ""doing"" of moral theology in the Anglican/Episcopalian tradition, like many other elements of Anglicanism, is based on scripture, reason and tradition to develop principles. In fact, Holmgren argues persuasively that moral theology is a series of axioms to live by, and that by so doing, you follow the Anglican Christian tradition. He discusses the role of conscience, reason, situational ethics, natural law, scriptural context and divine grace and the cycle of fall and redemption through saving grace. A good handbook for ethical decisionmaking and learning an effective framework for ""doing"" Christian ethical and moral theology."
2,below mediocre,"there's about 3 decent covers here. most of the artists have bad vocals , which is ok if they're great musicians, which most are not. most of the artists have no soul. they're different artists, but the singers sound very similiar. nuthin' groundbreaking. makes me wanna listen to marc's vocal treatment of the originals. i would pay $4 for this cd. marc's live version of 'say hello...' is most likely the same as that found on the berlin dvd. can't understand why soft cell condone this thing. buy the live in milan dvd."
3,ignore the stars,"I only read two chapters of this book for ADO.Net and Multithreading. I would have to say that the ADO.Net section was good. On the otherhand, the Multithreading section was very skimpy, but it does show the reader where to start."
1,Not worth it. Too many mistakes.,This is by far the worst book I have ever read on any programming language. I would have to say that 90% of the code examples are wrong. I have been programing in VB.NET since the beta's and thought this book might be good for some reference. I was totally wrong.Seems to me that it was written too fast by to many blind people who have no idea what they where doing. Its almost as if they where making things up as they went along! If you want a good book dont get this one.
4,Thorough and well worth it,"I thought the book was well written and very informative. Yes, I agree that it lacks a complete OO discussion, but if you want that get an OOP book. Besides that I think they cover both the language and the IDE very well, with good examples and good discussion.Additionaly the book makes a great reference to the language and IDE after your done reading it completely."
5,Accolades for this Cancer Treatment,"What a precise plain English language explanation of the function of body cells. A no nonsense, look at the way cells become abnormal and the reason why they multiply and explode into cancerous masses. This book and the treatment named promises to be a major contribution to the prevention and treatment of breast and other cancers."
5,Great For All Nancy/Hardy Fans,"In the spirit of Nancy Drew and The Hardy Boys, The Dana Girls Mystery Stories are exciting, involving, and a must read from cover to cover! I recommend this whole series for ages 7-101. These books are timeless and fun and I want to own them all!"
5,Does the job!,"This is great if you would like to use the belt clip that originally came with your iPod, and if you only really want protection for the front of your iPod. It has a screen protector, and it is made of hard plastic. It snaps on and off easily for cleaning. It doesn't cover any thing it shouldn't be covering up, so you have access to all of the ports for charging or for the headphones.Overall this is a great product and very reasonably priced."
4,High Quality,"What more can I say, it is a cover. The quality is good I think, I have never purchased anything like this before. However, the cover also covers up the screen. I purchased this as a gift so i cant really clip it on the ipod to see if it affects the visibility, but it is something i didnt notice from the pictures. I will even post an ""action shot"" to help future customers :D"
5,Statistics: The Exploration & Analysis of Data,"It is good.The book is fine, don't dirty, don't have note or highlight. The shippment is on time.I satisfy with this product."
3,Better title: Boeing Aircraft,"The book is a good look at Boeing's aircraft, from 1916 to present --- you see the 707 for the first time 43 percent through the book. Lots of color photos. Photos of older aircraft are mostly recent photos of restored planes.I recommend it if you're into climb rates, engine model numbers, service ceilings, and other minutiae. If you're interested in the company and the people in it, its struggles and triumphs, you'll get very little of that here."
5,Unusual,"It is a very pretty birdfeeder, not a common design. I like the fact it is easy to fill. The birds seem to enjoy it a lot they are all over it! It is a very decorative addition to my house."
4,Dead Letter,"This book is an exciting, suspenseful book. You can't wait to turn the page and see what is going to happen next. Although you can predict some of what might happen, you are never possitvely wrong and there's always a surprise, hiding around the corner."
4,Menchaca as college text,"I recently read The Mexican Outsiders for a class @ Portland State University and found it to be a real eye-opener for this suburban white-boy. Menchaca uses legal records, historical documents, newspapers and interviews to paint a picture of Santa Paula, California that spans more than a century of abuse and exploitation. I found myself outraged at the human capacity for selfishness. This book is well written with a relatively linear chronology that clearly introduces Menchaca's theories and ties them up neatly in the end, all the while telling a story that I discovered was imortant to me. My only criticism: At times it seems that Menchaca's shared history with Santa Paula gets mixed with her research to the point that she appears biased. It is understandable, but it makes this study feel less academic. Required reading for folks that think they understand Mexican immigration in the U.S."
4,satisfying reunion,"At the beginning of this book is the conclusion of how Miyazawa's parents got together. After this sweet story, it's back to our main characters. Finally, Soichiro comes back from his tournament, and he and Miyazawa are reunited. She notices how much he has matured---he's gotten taller, more serious (if that's possible), and even more mysterious than ever. He's noticed his feelings have changed too...ah why do boys have to grow up. He's no little kid anymore...but neither is she. O well. It's a fun and romantic read, but be warned it's not for kids anymore; for this reasion I gave it four stars, because I liked it better when there was the simple, sweet romance and not hot burning passion...:)"
2,disappointing,"Although the samples here on Amazon sounded questionable, I went ahead and bought this disk to see what the SACD format might add to one of my favorite pieces of music. Well, I should have trusted my instincts.The performance is simply dull. Slow moving (even for a requiem) and uninspired - lacking in cohesiveness and emotion. If pressed to find something positive, I suppose I could say that the sound is organic and unpolished, which can be a nice change from some of the over-produced titles.The worst offense here is the sound engineering. The sound levels are not nearly optimized - the volume must be turned up quite far, and yet even then the dynamics are just not there. The sound is also unbalanced, with cello and bass overemphasized. I can only wonder why they bothered with the SACD format...it is wasted on this recording, other than to once again prove the maxim; garbage in, garbage out.I apologize for being so blunt, but this disk is best avoided."
2,Not the best version!,"This version was okay as a regular CD (which I've owned and played for several years), but as a SACD the better version is Phillipe Herreweghe's 1893 version of the Requiem. If you carried that, I would buy it in a heartbeat.NE Ohio listener"
5,Outstanding Album!,"This album left me speechless! These guys are the real deal.You will definitely get your money's worth and will have the urge to pass it on to all your friends. Each track is powerful in its own way and will make you angry,sad and even laugh at times. All tracks are good. The best one is Reality Check. That is the one that made me laugh. Shame on Lil' Wayne and Destiny's Child! I love it :)"
1,Doesn't tell time,"This may be a fun looking watch, but it loses time every day, so it's never accurate. Probably it's a battery, but when you but a new watch, don't you expect it to include a new battery?"
5,Great series,"I really enjoyed the series. I do not understand why it was cancelled.The story line was great. It was about a teenager who washed up on shore.She discovered she had certain powers. There was a reason for her to bein Point Pleasant. Whe was received well by a family. When here secretstart to come up, things start to change. Good story line. I do not wantto give away the movie. Must see."
4,Some degree of Closure,"Well, for those of you reading this, you really don't need a review, since you already know about this wonderful series that was prematurely cancelled by FOX. So, I'll just give you my opinion of the disc. The disc is very good quality, captions are welcome sometimes for some of the more subtle dialogue. AND the final 3 unaired episodes are most welcome. At least we now know what the writers were heading for and what we could have expected in the coming season that never materialized.If you were a fan of this show, you have to have this disc!"
5,Why did it end?,This show was probably one of my all time favorites. I loved how the characters interacted with each other. Im dissapoited they took it off the air with such a cliffhanger ending. This was a perfect series. LOVED IT! Brilliant. I was screaming in excitment on almost every episode.
3,Canceled too soon!,"Yes I agree that the pilot ep was nothing more than OC (a soap orera). They should have reworked the pilot or put ep 1 and 2 together. I think that ep 1 lost alot of viewers. But, those of us who stuck around for ep 2, were in for an horror treat! Yes I agree, a modern day Dark Shadows! Then FOX started changing nights, timeslots, skiping weeks...no wonder it was canceled, we didn't know when it was on! Can't wait for the DVD!!!"
3,Could have been good,"I have to agree with the rater who compared Point Pleasant to my favorite show Twin Peaks. The first thing that came to mind was that Point Pleasant tries to be kind of like a ""modern"" Twin Peaks for a younger generation. But this does not work. The substance was just not there. It staid too much on the surface without really touching the evil that lies within (except for Grant Show who did deliver at times). Plus the humor, which is an important factor, was missing.With that said, I have to confess that I did enjoy watching the plot develop on disc two. There were some good ideas there that could have / should have been developed. The last Episode seemed like it was made up in a hurry when the show was cancelled. Everything was packed into that episode and then there was this cliffhanger at the end. Did not like that."
3,"Interesting, but somewhat disappointing","This show had an interesting premise, but the description made it sound better than it was. The show was sort of slow in developing, and you had to work to keep your attention on it. Add in the fact that it was cancelled right when it finally started getting really good, and I can't say I'd recommend sending your money on this one. It left me feeling unsatisfied, and wishing I'd spent the money on something else instead."
5,Cancelled way too soon!!!,"""Point Pleasant"" was just another one of the wonderful, original shows FOX is known for--known for introducing and then barely giving a chance before cancellation, i.e. ""Wonderfalls"", ""Firefly"", ""John Doe"", ""Tru Calling"". This show got better and better with each episode and had me hooked, even though there weren't nearly enough episodes. Unfortunately, FOX decided to cancel it before we could see the 'scariest episode yet' that was advertised. What a shame. I was hoping that it would be released on DVD so that I could watch the episodes over again and see the ones that were never aired for the first time. This show was clever and inventive. It had mystery, horror, interesting relationships and great chemistry between the main teenage characters. Grant Show also did a wonderful job of playing the show's villian. I hope this show does well on DVD. I'm definitely looking forward to the release of this DVD set."
5,BRING BACK POINT PLEASANT,"This show was different then all the other crap out there. Marti Noxon is fun, witty, and smart and she was getting somewhere with this. FOX has this thing where they love to cancel shows after 5 epsisodes exp. Wonderfalls, Tru Calling (Both Great shows) these were the shows I actually liked and now they are gone. The one thing YOU can do is buy the DVD's. SO please do!=) PP is so interesting and if you loved the Omen then you'll love this. Just because it deals with religion doesnt make it bad just more challanging. It's fresh and fun. Let's show FOX that removing this show was a BAD move on their part!!! BUY! BUY! BUY!"
1,UNWATCHABLE,"I've struggled, suffered and made it through a lot of bad TV in my time, but this show, this show is the first show I've ever found completely unwatchable. I only made it through episode 4 before I couldn't stand it anymore. As noted by others, horrible, horrible writing. Boring. Confusing. Convoluted. With virutally NO decent drama or action or romance or anything remotely entertaining. THE WRITING IS SO BAD. Bad casting. Bad acting. Horrible editing. Even the music from Danny Elfman is bad. So I suggest avoiding this disaster at all costs! Total waste of money and time."
3,I seriously thought this show could be a little better...,"I started to really get into this show in the beginning, but then near the final DVD, it just started to go way downhill and fake.Too much running around, too wordly, too little action I guess.it really IS like the O.C. and Buffy the Vampire Slayer combined. which in a way is good, but then to me the bad weighted out a little bit more."
3,"Sweet, sweet guilty pleasure.","I loved watching this series when it was originally on FOX. I don't remember much about it: Dripping wet Elisabeth Harnois was a bad-ass child of Satan, and there was lots of girl-on-girl action. If you're a certain kind of person, this alone is enough to merit your attention. You know who you are; enjoy the show."
2,Lifeless and Mechanical,"The women in this are beautiful, with well-sculpted bodies and the stories SHOULD be interesting, but there doesn't seem to be any spark here. There is no chemistry between the partners, and no sense of any real emotion or drama. Everybody is simply miming, and the sex scenes carry with them no sense of reality or involvment. It's almost like watching very high-quality computer generated images, instead of real people with real feelings for and about each other.It's worth seeing once, if only to enjoy Tane McClure and Kim Yates in the buff, but it's not something for the long-term collection. :("
3,Dehydrated Surf Music,"This is basically surf music with a heavily distorted lead guitar and without vibrato. The musicians are a 3-piece band. It is easier to describe as what it is not. It does not have the polish of The Ventures or The Shadows, the creativity of Laika & The Cosmonauts or The Surf Kings, the beat of the Langhorns or the Volcanos, the joy of Los Straitjackets, or the beauty of Jon & the Nightriders. It is straightforward, basic, and competent but rather mundane, unsubtle, and repetitious. Sure, repetition is in the genre, but it is overdone here. It is ok as background music to work to. The title and cover are crude for surf music. The first song title ""Too Much Lasix"" reflects on the album. Lasix makes you dehydrated. This CD is surf riffs without shimmer, twang, reverb, whammy-vibrato, jangling rhythm chords, ticka-ticka splash or lightness of being. This is dehydrated surf music."
1,1GB!!!!!!! you're kidding right? just 1 GB!!!!!,"For $19999 you could have someone make a gold case for a 60gb Ipod or buy 100 nanos for 100 of your closest friends and you'd impress them more than with this ugly thing.That's another thing, IT'S NOT EVEN PRETTY!!, if you wanted to make something so ridiculous, at least you should have hired a good jewelery designer and bought a bigger hard drive. I hope whoever buys this, gives something to the needy."
2,Disappointing...,"I was going to buy this, but I found out the cases only come in black, red, and green. I WANTED AN ORANGE CASE! Instead I bought form their competitor, it's only 500 MBs and it's actually bigger, and the battery pack doesn't last long, and you can't replace a dead one, you just gotta buy a whole new one, but you get a coupon for a free slushi at the mall and the cases come in orange."
2,Insane,"Anybody willing to pay even more than $1K for a media player is totally insane. Anybody who is willing to pay for something in gold and diamonds on an item that probably will be outdated in less than a year is crazy. Forget about German craftsmanship and exquisite design. Think about technology, not looks."
1,diamonds are a girl's best friend,why do females like diamonds...cause its shiny...do you know what else likes shiny things??? raccoons...and maybe moths...i can see paris hilton using this.
1,The most expensive MP3 player holds... 1Gb,1 Gb! Been a millionaire doesn't mean been stupid and 1Gb is just too small.
1,Joke?,"This some april fools joke or what n o millionaire would buy this, and its only 1gb millionaires aint stupid u know...."
1,STUPID,"Why spend $19,000 on something that plays music? you can get an ipod for $400 tops. So what if its fancy? get a $200 mp3 player and paint it gold! This is a waste of money. What do u want? a shiney mp3 player, or a loaded Honda Accord? think about it."
1,"FUNNY & KIDDING.... Stupic first guy leave rewiew,No, I think he is the owner of the TrekStor","I can spend $149 dollar for Ipod 1GB, But for this one in my mind maybe worth 79.99. 18K gold not 24K gold, 18K gold is cheap gold..Is it real diamond? How many K? Did you have certified-gift approve it?(it's real diamond)Maybe crystal... funny"
1,.....,most of them are full of **** they actually didnt buy this. people get killed over this type of thing (playstation 3 comes to mind).they should just remove this from their inventory. i would just pay down on a house. go to cabelas you could buy a cabin for less than this.
1,This is the most stupidest product I've ever heard!,Bill Gates:That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard!
1,Not good enough for me!,"If I were a millionaire who can spend ANY amount for an MP3 player, this thing is not enough for me! Give me a one TERRABYTE Mp3 gold-plated, diamond laced player (think Liberace's style) and I'll pay $50,000 (or more) for that!"
1,cheap silver tarnishes quickly,"I loved the chain initially,especially for the price. Shortly after the chain started looking brownish-yellow loosing all shine. I placed it in jewlery cleaner, to no avail. you can not tell if the chain is real silver."
5,AWSOME!!!!,"Not only is the chain beautiful but the company is AWSOME!!!! I had a problem with my USPS, they lost my package. Well Sabrina Silver helped me and I recieved a replacement 3 days later!!!! I will be ordering from them from now on!!!!"
1,Very weak chain,"I bought 2 chains based on a reviewer that wrote how strong the chain was. This chain is pretty but it is not strong in fact it is very weak. The first chain broke taking it out of the plastic pouch got caught in the zip lock.I'll stick to buying chains I can hold and check in person, I don't blame the seller I think it is listed properly as a very thin chain."
1,broke right away,I ordered four and they were all nice looking but the littlest one as soon as I tried the clasp the clasp broke. The ones that did not break are really great.
2,Cheap because it's cheap!,"Started tarnishing the day I opened it. I've had it for three months and it looks like an old, ugly, gold chain; when it started out as a sparkly, shiny, silver chain! Don't get it unless you're prepared with Silver Jewelry cleaner on hand."
5,Beautiful,"This is a really nice chain. For the price I paided I expected something very cheap, but I was very wrong. It shined in the light and it's just a beautiful chain. This is a perfect buy if your looking for a 925 chain, but not looking to pay a lot of money."
2,Not a great offering in pure nickel strings,High E broke in 2 sets. Tone was brighter than I expected from pure nickel. Overall I just didn't like them. I prefer GHS Burnished Nickels.
5,I ordered it. But Not Johnny Cash as you Stated.???,"You people said this was a Johnny Cash video, what happened. Did you send me the wrong video?. The video sent is Riding the Rails alright but just about the 4449 train at Oregon. Now What?"
5,All Good,What would you expect from a hits package? This is all the best from Smash Mouth and as a fan of the band I feel this is a very good compilation.
4,excellent cd,"I got this cd primarily for two songs, All Star and Walking on the Sun. I tend to keep listening to my favorites, but the other songs are good too. Overall, a good CD that I will enjoy more with time."
1,Smash Mouth is bad.,"Smash Mouth is a boring dull band for people like Guy Fieri. Bought this as a gag gift for my companies Yankee Swap, that says it all."
5,As Described,Very satisfied with this product. I like how it sustains that natural look. I would definitely recommend this product to friends.
4,Escape From Saigon: How a Vietnam War Orphan Became an American Boy,"Easy reading, good personal story of Operation Babylift. I had previously read ""War Cradle"", a very wordy, messy retelling of the story. This one is much more elementary and not as detailed, but follows one boy through his life. Fascinating."
5,Tells an Important Story,"I also could not put this book down and had to read it straight through. Andrea Warren does a compelling and balanced job in telling Long's story. Not only do we gain real insight into how the war affected families and children in Vietnam, but we also learn the thoughts and hopes of children living in orphanages. As an adoptive mom, I found this to be a valuable book on many levels."
2,How low can you go?,"The TARDIS passes through an area on the edge of the universe, where it is caught in a planet that is being formed. But it is not the only thing: the P7E, a Minyan quest ship, is also caught as it is seeking the lost Minyan race banks.Trapped within the newly formed planet, the Doctor, Leela and K9 join up with the crew of the other ship as the quest draws to its conclusion - but there is something else in the underworld as well...My main problem with this story is that it is a fairly poor retelling of the Greek myth of Jason and the Argonauts, and not a terribly great one in any case. At least, in written form, we are spared the endless CSO background that made the story even more of a chore to watch.Terrance Dicks tries to lift the story from its mire, and makes a good effort, but there wasn't any real way it could be saved."
4,Forza 2,"This game is great! i only rated it a 4 star because at the begining, i got pissed. this game will get you so mad that you just want to shut it off....but dont give up and get better! This game has the best graphics on a racing game (next to rad racer for the nes). this is the most realistic racing game you will ever play. and if you keep playing, i promise you'll get better and you will love it like how i Now i love this game!"
4,Forza Motorsport 2,This game is OK but right off the bat you do not get enough cars to use. I believe for what you pay for this you should have more choices.
4,I lost interest quickly,"This is another forza game where you get to drive a whole bunch in hopes to earn money to get cars and stuff. Got boring quick. Got to play the faster cars with someone whose beaten it. Still unimpressed. It looks good, though."
3,game,game is in good working order not what I thought is was going to be like it a little diff from need for speed
2,Juvenile,"The physics are extremely ""floaty"" even with the hardest suspension and tire pressure settings. From a distance the game is like a snowboarding game. The steering is very laggy. When coming out of corners you're forced to jam the steering in the opposite direction to ""get more response"". Iracing.com simulator with 1-to-1 steering has no such issues with the same car (miata mx-5 cup) and same track (mazda leguna seca).Everything ""weird"" about this game is the result of the beta-testing which was apparently done by 10 year-olds and confused baby-boomers. I'm sure someone complained about sensitive steering and the ""shaky"" sensation of speed that a real car gives you. That's why this game is juvenile."
5,EXCELLENT DRIVING GAME - LOTS OF FUN TIMES!!,"ITS A FUN AND COOL GAME...SHOULD YOU GET IT...IF YOU LIKE CARS, YES. SIMPLE AS THAT. THE PHYSICS, GRAPHICS, CUSTOM SETTINGS, GAMEPLAY ETC IS ALL TOP NOTCH. THIS BELONGS IN YOUR GAME LIBRARY.BRING IT GRAN TURISMO!! (BY THE TIME GT COMES OUT, WELL HAVE FORZA 3!)"
3,The bad side...,"This is a very fun and difficult game. The bad side is, that tis for xbox360 only and taht console burn itself."
5,Pretty fun,good game love the auction block where you can buy custom cars from real people with money earned in single player
4,This game is better than gran turismo,Some friends told me about the game.So i decided to buy it.Once i first started to play i was fascinated.I love how i can do anything with the cars tune up wise.And another aspect is i can trade or sell cars on xbox live.So if you like racing games that are very realistic then you should be happy with this game
5,Great if played with racing wheel controller,i'm having a great xperience with this game. Use with the official steering wheel. Can't get more real than that.
5,Best racing game,"I spent lots and lots of time playing Forza on xbox, so naturally I had to buy a 360 just for this game. let me say it was way worth it. you can do lots of things in this game. you can buy a honda hatch and swap and S2000 motor in it. great graphics, GREAT physics. everything great. if your into racing then this is the game for you. if your into ricey crap then stick to NFS."
2,No Fun,"I dont know about anyone else, but i dont have a racing wheel. i am going to buy one, but without one for this game, you cant drive!!!! i spent over 1/2 an hour trying to get around one turn without crashing, and/or skidding out, and spinning. i cant controll the cars with the little mobility of the left stick. they tell you to brake around corners, but when i brake, my car spins in cirlces, and then i have to rive back to get myself started. its not good, i might change my oppinion when i get a racing wheel, otherwise. DONT BUY THIS GAME IF YOU DONT HAVE A RACING WHEEL!"
5,Great piping,"A great set of performances. Truly enjoyable standard setting excellence. It is a true joy to get to hear playing of this level at this high level of recording quality,"
3,Not easy reading!,"I just purchased the updated 2006 edition from B&N. Although this book is very useful and informative, I must say I have a difficult time understanding all the medical terminology. Eventhough they attempt to give definitions of all the medical terminology, the definition itself is too complicated. I feel like I need to go to medical school to understand this book completely."
3,Wii Rescue,"It was abot ten days before Christmas and I had checked just about every store in the Gulf Coast looking for this Wii. Best Buy had this great beautiful neon-lighted display rising in electronics like a plexigass skyscraper, I was drawn to it like a moth, but the kid-employee just laughed when I asked him what aisle had all the Wii's for sale. He said 4 might be coming in Sunday, but that I'd probably have to get in line around 8 (store opens at 12), I got so desperate I tried to bribe a stocker at Walmart. I tried a hundred places on-line and everyone was either out, or exploiting guys like me, by charging an extra [..]or so....but Amazon.com saved the day. Had them, and at the going price, and got it to me in 3 days, free shipping. The Wii is great, Amazon.com is great!"
5,LOVE IT,"When the Wii first game out I thought it was weird and wouldn' last. Boy, was I wrong. We absolutely love it and the games that you can get to play on the Wii are very reasonably priced and something that you can have groups play. We wouldn't trade it for the world!"
4,It is what I thought it was.,"This console is fantastic. My only minor gripe with it is that it is only 480P...especially since my TV is 61 inches! Oh well, the Xbox 360 is for hardcore gaming. This gripe aside, this system really gets your blood pumping and your sweat dripping! The Wii Sports that accompanies this system along with the Wii Fit game/board really offers an alternative to traditional gaming.Highly recommended!"
4,Good Gaming,"The Wii is good fun, especially in groups. It does, however, lack in the more advanced single-player games. Selection is somewhat limited as compared to the PS3 and XBOX 360."
4,Great product,Purchased gaming package for family use. Package came with five basic sports program. Family has had hours of enjoyment with this gaming unit. Would suggest purchasing additional controller and nunchuk controller for play with multiple players.
2,Fun...but fragile.,"The Wii is a lot of fun. But, here, five months after purchase, I have to send it in for repair. Nintendo tells me the ""card reader"" is likely shot. It will not read any disc. I tried their cleaning kit, to no avail. Five months of use. My old Gamecube lasted six years, sometimes being left on 24 hours a day for weeks. My Wii, in comparison, was babied, never played more than a few hours. I will say that Nintendo's customer service seems quite good, and they're repairing it free. Still, a month without a game console is not fun. I thought, being Nintendo, the Wii would be ultra reliable, but Nintendo tells me that mine is a common problem."
5,great console,"when i got this console almost 6 moths ago... i had doubts about the wii, today i know it is the best gaming system, i have nothing but good things to say about this console, for those who are still between this and the others... get wii... xbox360 games? pfff thats what i have my pc for... and dont rrod or sounds like a jet turbine."
5,"It's even fun for ""Non-Gamers!""","I have never had a game system, have not been interested in these video games since the days of Qbert & Frogger... always thought they were a waste of time since I am always so busy with work and other priorities. But then I had the chance to buy this at Xmas time thru Amazon, and boy, am I hooked! I can't say that I still have the time, but now I have to make time. Not only is this a blast, but I can honestly say my body feels like I'm actually getting some exercise! I had to recuperate after the first couple of days of playing (my fitness age started at 71, i'm sorry to say, but now I'm down to 37, which is darn good for this 44 year old!) This is fun and exercise all rolled into one!"
5,Wii is GREAT!,"I purchased this a week ago. I have owned many game systems and I love this one. It is fun for everyone. I like that fact that you can play the older games also. Even my 3 year old grandson can play this. (he bowled a strike). I do not think we will grow tired of this system. I am anxious for more items available on the menu and shopping.One word of advice, if you can purchase this, get an extra remote while they're in the stores."
5,WII A great console for a great price.,"I am a pretty big gamer and I have tried and have owned the PS3, 360 and the handhelds. When it comes to my favorite i can honestly say i have gotten the most enjoyment from the nintendo wii. It makes you quite active and keeps you energetic on a lot of games. The controller is different but easy to get used to. The only downfall i have on the Wii is that there are still not a big selection of games on it. There is no online play (from what i have seen) and the sensor can be a pain to set up if you don't have a good amount of room to play. Its my favorite system overall and hope they continue doing stuff with it."
5,What a Surprise!,"I picked up the Wii this past week as a Christmas present for my kids. Of course, as the responsible dad that I am, I had to 'test' the system, just to make sure everything works on Christmas morning. I've only played the included Sports game, but the control is a refreshing change from our PS2. I can't wait for Christmas morning."
5,One giant leap for the gameing Generation,"Nintendo did it! I have been wondering when one of the 3 were going to pull out a new idea. Cause not one company has come up with anything original in Years. The Wii is an absolutly amazing console. Now granted most of the game are childish, but there are a small handful of cool games out there for it. I got mine used and with out Wii Sports, but in all this console is just too cool for words."
1,Brandon,The NYKO black wand does not work with the Wii system. we just bought 2 brand new wands from the store and one of them does not work!!!!! Don't waste your money on it just get a Wii Brand
3,Nothing good after the n64 era,"Very few Wii games are good. If you look at the statistics, the vast majority of Wii games are in fact of very poor standard. The only bearable titles are Mario, Zelda, and Metroid. The only game I was addicted to was Mario Kart Wii. Also, the system doesn't support DVD moves. The hardware is also very weak; I'd be surprised if it is even 10% better than the GCN. The controllers use AA batteries and you can't charge them by connecting them to the system."
3,Wii for Winners,"My son likes the WII, specially when it is raining outside or cold and when we cannot play real sports outside. As long as you limit, this is a good addiction and WII is designed for all age groups!"
1,Disapointed,I thought that I bought the Wii with the sports included I was surprised that they had it at a very low price 130 well the thing was it wasn't as advertised on this page I bought from this location and it came down that the Wii did not had the sports game seriously I won't recommend it
2,console,"The system was in OK condition for not what I expected for what I paid. I had to replace the wireless bar that receives the remotes commands because the wire had been cut, and for that cost I could have just paid the extra 20.00 for a new system instead of 20 less for the used one. I am not real happy about this."
2,cannot get it...,I cannot get this Wii to work sense I got it. The romotes are charged but I cannot get it to work so I am a bit disturbed about the money I spent and I have not gotten to play it.
3,not what it seems,"I own a ps3, xbox 360 and a wii but the wii is not as good as you might think cause there just arent many good games for it, but those that are good like super smash bros brawl and super mario galaxy are all reasons to buy a wii but there just arent many good games for the wii yet."
4,Wow - Great for whole family,"This is only the 2nd review I've ever written on Amazon, but I just had to say a few things about the Wii. It's great. It only took 15 minutes to setup and then I was playing tennis, boxing, bowling, and finally the Marvel Ultimate Alliance game. This game is great for two big reasons. First, I actually got tired boxing and got a little winded playing tennis. That is great for the kids. They won't just sit there and push buttons. The 2nd great thing is the numchuck. I have never been good at figuring out the combiantions of buttons to press, and the numchuck minizmizes the need for that skill. The only negative are the graphics, but for $250 they are fine. I just started playing today, so I will probably update this later."
4,wow,"thats what i said ......wow . i ordered the nintendo wii on a monday and it was here on wednesday . no shipping or taxes . and thats after looking online at walmart , kmart , target and even craigslist. you couldnt beat that deal if you tried. and i got it at the price the other stores were advertising it for ."
4,Wii Review,My son and husband love the wii. Only problem we have had so far is one of the remotes doesn't work as well as the other.
3,Not for RPG players.,"First, let me say that there are many positives to the Nintendo Wii. The system is intuitively designed and, if you enjoy the motion sensing novelty, can be extremely enjoyable. However, one of my biggest reservations about buying the Wii in the first place was that it lacked a range of RPG titles, leaving me with games like Mario Kart and Super Smash Bros that are fun, to be sure, but provide me with many less hours of entertainment than my PS2 did. Unfortunately, until Sony can fix its backwards compatibility issue and bring its mid-range models down in price, the Wii is the more cost-effective and more affordable option."
1,Wii,"Barely got to play it. Had to go get a new wii controller because the original one was broken, then the wii itself quickly stopped working. Never buying from EZCORPSE again."
5,"Greed...forget the kids this Christmas, let's just take care of the greedy Wii hoarders.","Want to buy a Wii for you 12 year old daughter this Christmas? You have two choices. Get very lucky, or pay a $300 premium over retail to buy one from the secondary market where greedy individuals buy all available inventory, making sure you don't have a chance--then sell it for a $300 profit. Call it free enterprise if you must. Seems shameful to me though."
1,I thought it was new.,"It says in the condition new. I opened the box to find a kinda scratched wii, sticky controlers, wii sports and the cables. You owe me a new wii. Not a used one."
3,"wii is just ""OK""","i have had the wii for about 3 months now, i actually bought it for my son but secretly i wanted one so badly.i really wish i had bought a playstation 3, a lot of the wii games are poor versions of ps3 and x box games.i dont like the fact that you have to use the nunchuk and wiimote for games that would be so much easier to play with a standard controller - like i was really looking forward to playing call of duty, but its impossible with the wiimote and nuchuk, you end up trying your hardest just to keep your hand still so you can move properly, there is no option for a classic controller which you could rest on your knee for more control, a lot of the games are like this.i really really dont recommend the wii if you are a hardcore gamer, you will be dissapointed.on the other hand wii fit is very good, also Dance revolution is great fun, rock band 2 is immense, but i really would not buy a wii again just for wii fit."
2,No Red,"The game is easy to use and fun to play only my unit shows no red. Since I didn't figure this out until after the thirty day return, I am stuck trying to find somewhere else to fix it. Otherwise I am satisfied with the product."
5,AWSOME!!,"Get the Wii! The remote as a motion sensor! And Wii sports comes with it FREE! When you play tennis, you actually have to swing the remote as if you are really playing it! And one of the best parts about it is you can download any Nintendo game from the NES to the N64! And in the Wii, if you are playing boxing or any other sport, you are have lots of fun while at the same time, you are getting lots of exercise! The Wii is very cool and it is much cheaper than the PS3! Get this! It is worth it!"
1,Boooooring,"I bought into all the hype and got way excited when I saw a Wii sitting on the shelf, well shock first that there was actually 3 sitting on the shelf then excited. I snatched it up, bought a game and went right home and set it up. The excitment lasted about 10 minutes into playing :( This isn't the sort of system that you can just sit down and play a game which by the way is the type of game I bought. I could see how for the sports type games and the new Wii Fit that just came out how this could be fun but for those of us who like the other types of games it just doesn't cut it. And I tried to get it to play my GameCube games and it kept spitting them back out and said it couldn't read disc. Luckily I got WalMart to take the darn thing back!!"
1,save yourself a buck go to walmart.com,I can't beleive how outrageous people are selling the Wii console on amazon.com. Save yourself a buck and buy a brand new one at Walmart.com for $249.99.
1,Sell This Console!!!,"The Wii is nothing compared to the Xbox 360 or the ps3. The Wii is only selling well in Japan not in the US. This system only produces second rate copies of games on other consoles and its exclusive titles rely on stupid gimmicks. It is not a next-gen console because its graphics suck, its online is worthless,cannot play movies at all, and its store is useless. This consoles defeat is imminent and you don't want to own this console when that happens. Any one even considering buying this game should go with either the Xbox 360 or the ps3. Unless you don't care about graphics or you are a non-gamer."
1,Poor Options eqauls large DOA problem,"We payed through the nose to get a bundle on line for our kid for her birthday. After the big build up, Got it set up, it wouldn't load the discs. I'm not saying it wouldn't recognize the discs, it wouldn't pull them in. We can get a repair in 15 business days or pay a fee and get a refurb unit in 3 business days. These lousy 2 choices indicate to me that they must have a fairly large dead on arrival problem. Beware."
1,Quality Control,"I guess when you sell this many units, there's bound to be flaws in some of them...all the same, I'm the one that got a console for X-mas with a faulty power switch! Returned it without a hassle, I'll spend my dollars on real sports gear this year instead. I do have to wonder how this shipped from the factory with such an obvious flaw, any one else have quality control issues with these units?"
5,Me and my mom have fun with the Wii!,I saved up all my money for 6 months to get the Wii i was so happy when i went in to Gamestop and got it i took it home and me and my mom opened it set it up then we had a ball playing wii sports.We played for like 3 hours i think the wii has made me and my mom closer.You should get a wii if you are looking for a good time even if you don't like video games you will love the wii!
4,Awesome game system!!,"Never being a video game fan until got this wii console. Share with friends, really enjoyingable."
4,"Pretty good, for all ages...","i am not sure how professional video game players feel abt it... but i am having lot of fun... though the graphics are not really great (for the games i have), i dont need to know lot of controls & stuff... i play the games as if i am really playing the actual games, atleast for tennis, bowling, baseball etc... overall, loved it.."
4,Can't compare to the others!!!!,"The wii is a fun console but you can't compare it to the 360 or p3.. It's just diffrent than them. The graphics are good but it's hard to tell if they are better than the game cube.. If you are a hard core gamer you might not like this console the game selection is week and theres not that good of online play. I own all 3 console and I like the 360, wii, then p3. I am a father of a two year old and a two month old so I have little time and when I do get some time I'm on the 360 playing with a buddie.. Overall the wii is still worth getting it's fun during partys and it's fun playing with the wife."
5,I have Wii Fever,"It's great, I love it i wake up and i want to play, i play before i go to bed and i just can not stop playing, my wrist does hurt but thats because i play it a lot. I think it's the greatset thing having Wii parties are so fun, everybody jumping and moving around all over the place is hilarious especially when you accidently hit someone it sound bad but everybody's understanding about it because everybody has a good time playing wii and it comes with so many accessories and things for it i have always loved nintendo consoles as a child and nintendo has always made me happy."
5,Wii and wii sport,"Love it, Love it, Love it. I have sooo much fun playing with this and so does my husband."
2,Wii - Why?,"In my OPINION, this system was not needed, and was only produced because of the XBOX360 AND PS3 emerging. The GameCube never got on its feet and then the Wii comes out. It feels like a gimmick that falls flat with the Wii-motes and many peripherals.However, I admit that some games are fun and done well and it does continue the Nintendo tradition.Not long from now, another version of the Wii will be released that is backwards compatible, so don't bother buying this one at all anymore."
5,Mii loves Wii,I just got Wii this Chistmas.And I love it!---------Wii Sports----------BOXING:Awsome.Very good.But sometimes glitches.TENNIS:Very easy and fun.No drawback.BOWLING:Pretty nice.(Need more time tho)BASEBALL:Easy and sometimes too easy.GOLF:Fun.(More time Needed)Yeah I luv wii but dont get Marvel:UA.Anyways I recomend DBZ/Tenkaiichi Budokai 2 amd Zelda along with Excite Truck.A must have for evry1.(the console and the games)
5,It is that good,"Get one, if you can. It's as much fun as you have heard, and easy and intuitive to use. Gamers and gamer-haters alike will have a blast playing this and even watching others play it."
4,Fun but only as a secondary system!!!,"This System is a blast to play but I only recommened it to people who already have a xbox 360 or ps3....this is cause wii does'nt have all the great games that 360 and ps3 has such as gta 4!!! I mean it's fun and all when our with your buddies but its not the same when your by yourself, it a very nice system to have but only as a backup!!!"
2,Everything Old is New Again,"My first thought about the Wii was 'This is a slick system'. It is slick, from its packaging to its operations and characters. At first it was a lot of fun. But as I improved my skills on Wii Sports (Tennis and Baseball for me, primarily) I detected the old Nintendo tendency of the system playing me! Wii manipulates the player rather conspicuously. Every tennis game is brought to Deuce, no matter how much the AI has to fudge to do it. Sometimes it just renders your racket useless, sometimes it forces idiotic errors on you, or makes them itself. It also does this with your baseball bat, and manipulates the games to get a seemingly predetermined result.It also forces you to play against AI players with skill levels so high you really have no chance. You do not get to select them, Wii does that.It was great for a few weeks. Now, I still think it's slick, but just not any fun."
5,Wii,"This is a Christmas gift for our grandson, it has not yet been opened. But from previous experience we know it is fun for the whole family (three generations including 82 year old grandpa!) and are looking forward to it!"
4,Wii - It's Fun!,"Wii is a lot of fun. It's easy to set up and you can be playing in minutes. The Wii Sports games it comes with are fun to play and can give you quite a workout! We also purchased an extra controller with the Wii Play package, and the controller recharging station (highly recommend both). CAUTION when buying additonal games. Shortly after getting our Wii we purchased the M&M's Go Kart race game. In a word, it SUCKS. You can't make the cars turn as described in the instructions and hence the game is virtually unplayable. Tried to take it back but can't. Moral of the story: Know what games you are buying before laying out the $40++ for one. Other than that, we are really happy with the Wii!!!"
5,The best system if all time!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I waited in line for 7 hours to get the Wii without going on eBay. I got the first day and I also gota the new Zelda game. I first made a Mii, a avatar that you make, to play Wii Sports. The best in Wii Sports is either boxing or bowling. When I played Zelda I was blown away. It is SO much better than Wind Waker. I won't tell anyone what happens, you'll have to play it. The Wii is the best console on the market. YEAH NINTENDO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,wii,"after sitting up all night and clicking refresh all moring wii finally got it from amazon, there were only 2 how lucky are wii"
4,Customer Service,"There haven't been any posts lately are you guys still awake. I just got off the phone with a couple of different CS reps. Most of them were completely clueless, they didn't even know if the wiis already went on sale or if they're going on sale at all today. But one rep told me that they'd be on sale 8am PST(about 40 mins from now), and that they'd be $[...] and would be shipped immediately, and that their second batch of shipments would come during the second week of December. Just curious if anyone else got the same response from CS?"
2,would be awesome if it worked,"Got so excited got the wii ordered in time for xmas for the kids, get the thing hook it up and it doesn't work, instead of an exchange on there next shipment as they would usually do I get a refund and have to hunt for another one.."
2,Wii Review - Steven Wevodau - Little Disappointed,"I purchased the Wii for my children last Christmas. They had a Playstation and I thought this would be a great upgrade and they'd enjoy the new features you can only get with the Wii. Big Disappointment. The Wii gets old very quickly. The Wii game selection is only a fraction of what you can get with other gaming systems like the PS. I think this console is more for teens/adults and social gatherings and not for everyday playing of sports, etc. Therefore, looks like we'll be putting out [...] again this Christmas for the PS3....plus games - cha ching. Lot's of hype over this console - it is pretty neat - but gets old very quickly.Just my experience / opinion.Steven Wevodau[...]"
3,Depends heavily on what you are looking for,"If you are a hardcore gamer, this is likely not the system for you. There are myriad party games and some innovative titles, but anyone looking for a heavier game experience may be disapointed. After beating Twilight Princess, I hardly touched the system. In fact, I just sold the wii and and plan on purchasing a 360.However, the wii is a real crowd pleaser with family and those who do not typically play video games. It's been said a million times before, but it's true. The hardware is very reliable, and knowing Nintendo, they will eventually come out with some unique/ compelling software.For me though, marginally improved graphics from gamecube ports got tired relatively quickly. Recommended for casual gamers."
5,Fun for the entire family,"This is surely fun for the entire family.My 3 year old is very comfortable playing with it and even the 5 basic games that come with it are fun to play. There offcourse is choice to buy further games based on the individual's interest.All in all, a great product"
5,WII GAME SYSTEM,"Bought two of them, one for me and one for my daughter. I just love them, love playing the games. And then my daughter showed me how I can get NETFLIX on it too. I am soooooo pleased. Price was great too!"
5,Finally video games I can play,Never been able to master the strange movements of the other game controlers. This is so much better. The games that come with the system are great. It only gets better when you add on.
4,Wii,This is a white nintendo wii.It has many fun games and more. But most of the games are also on ds. But it is still fun.See ya
3,wii - 2,"Purchased one that had hard disk problem after about 1 year. Instead of sending to Nintendo, I opted to just purchase 2nd unit and toss first. Overall, kids love it but mine competes with Xbox. As kids get older (adolescence), they prefer xbox games to wii games. That said, it still gets pretty frequent use and works with Netflix."
5,I love the Wii!,"Im a big Ninetendo fan so the Wii was a must-have. With all the games available, I'm sure theres one for everyone to love. I originally bought the Wii for the WiiFit exercises, but when that became old, I bought other types of games to continue to have fun with it. I like it more than my playstations due to the fact it gets my butt up off the couch!"
3,Fun game but old strategy,This wii console brought me much fun. But the technology is kind of outdated. Recent release of Xbox kinetic and PS3 maybe a better investment.
3,wii,"It is a fun gaming console but it will not play cd's or dvd's and there isn't as many games for it and most of the games are too ""cartoon like"""
4,Nothing but Problems,"So the price finally went down, so I thought ""Why not?"" and purchased a brand new Wii system. I paid an extra 14 dollars to get it overnite, and to my suprise, when I got it the next day...it didnt work. i called Nintendo and had nothing but problems, so when they finally agreed to send me a new ( rather than refurbished, why should i get a previously broken game when i paid for a new one?). It took over a week, and what did i get? A new Wii Sports game!!! I called again, after 30 minutes of argument, they finally agreed to ship it. It took me three weeks to get a working system!! No compensation was offered...it was ridiculous!!"
5,Wii is best,"The Wii is the best gaming system out there. It cost less than a ps3 or a 360 and it has an interactive controller. It alaso has fun games like Zelda Twighlight Princess, Exctie Truck, and Wii Sports( included with wii). Its also comes with a mii channel, news channel, forecast channel, internet, and a shop channel where u can buy games from older nintendo sysytems(Nintendo 64) So what if it doesn't have the graphics of the ps3. It is more fun and u should definetley buy the wii."
5,Wii,This has been a fun game to play and my son has invested several hours trying to improve his ability to use various functions.
3,Fun console but limited appeal to serious gamers,"I consider myself a semi-hardcore gamer and own all the major consoles and play PC games as well. I bought a Wii soon after it came out but to be honest, although it's got some fun games (and my two-year-old loves the crude GT Pro game), overall it has limited appeal to serious gamers. If you go nuts over ""cute"" titles like Wii Fit and Mario, you won't be disappointed by the Wii. I use it occasionally, because I find the games not cool enough for 2008. (No, I'm not selling mine...)"
5,Awesome!!!!!!,"I never had so much fun in playing a video game console until I played the Wii. It is such a blast to play. My mother was even playing the Wii, and she doesn't play video games at all. I highly suggest getting yourself one of these, you won't be upset nor will anyone else around you for that matter."
3,Got boring!,It was fun at first and then it got boring. This system have been collecting dust. I am waiting for their new system.
5,So Happy I Finally Gave in and got the Wii!,"My grown children have been telling me for over a year that I needed to get a Wii with Wii Fit. I finally gave in and purchased both and I love them! I have now become a Wii junkie am always looking for new games and fun stuff to go with my Wii.On the surface, it seems like a pricey game, however, it is worth every penny and more. I have not ever been a ""gamer"" so I didn't see the point and I also wouldn't know the difference between the Wii and Xbox or any other game system. I just know that it gets us off our butts and playing something really fun as a family or alone.It also has wireless internet capability. If you have wireless internet, you can do a lot with that including downloading more games at reasonable cost.I highly recommend the Wii along with Wii Fit. You won't regret it!"
3,don't buy this,I got a wii for xmas. The wii is exciting at first but after a while the excitement goes away. there may be a lot of hype about the wii right now but after a while it goes away. The responsivness isn't that great and for twilight princess for the wii I hate to say but the gamecube version is better. with the sword it takes a few tries for it to respond. I prefer a regular control pad.After a while you'll wish you hadn't bought this system.Right now i want to have a regular control pad again instead of the wiimote.
5,Nunchuck is included,I had read a review when purchasing about what was included with the wii. They said that the nunchuck was not included just a controller. I just recieved the console today from Amazon and there is a nunchuck included.
3,"For all the hipe for this product, I was expecting much more.","I am a little disappointed with this product, but my kids still like it and I guess that's what's important. The graphics are really not that great, and the games don't look as good as their older gamecube. Only the sport package really involves moovig the remote control around, the games seem fun but after a while they get a bit boring.I guess what I am saying is that the for all the hipe for this product, I was expecting much more."
5,Wii,"Bought this for my 53 yr old husband for Christmas. He loves it, and so do I! Not just for kids... :)"
4,Neopet Puzzle Adventure,well that game is pretty hard but we are joyful and try our best game so i hope everyone have safe travel for new year eve .....
3,lasted five years,"The Wii is great for my two young boys, even though I originally bought this as an anniversary gift for my husband. Unfortunately it died on us a couple of months ago. I believe it died because the boys would keep it on for long periods of time while they did other things in order to save their place in the game they were playing. We just replaced it with the new model."
4,Good game,What we expected to receive. This is a good console game. But the list of games for adults is quite limited.
3,"Defective power chord, Otherwise great!","I bought this item from a used seller and the only thing I really have to complain about was the power chord was defective when I received it, which is a inexpensive part to buy so I really will not complain too much. Was shipped in a quick timely matter!"
5,wii may be the 2nd best system out there (windows PC bing best),"The Wii may not be the best graphics out there but graphics are not everything. I LOVE the wii because of the GAMES and the 100% GameCube compatibly. The other systems (ps3, xbox 360) have raelly bad compatibly with there older systems (ps2 xbox)and the games are not as fun!! Yes I have a PS3 and a PS2 but a love my wii alot more. It is all about the games not the system. Also the wii is not hi-def but if you really need hi-def you can get an ADS Technologies HDUP1500 HDTV Upconverterhttp://www.amazon.com/ADS-Technologies-HDUP1500-HDTV-Upconverter/dp/B00009XSYZ"
2,:(,"the wii didnt come with the games that was suppose to be included, selling takes for ever to write back. price keeps changing."
5,Simple Excellence,"The WII console is not what I would call fancy, which is not a negative comment. It is simple - simple to connect and simple to use. On the other hand, it is an amazing piece of technology. This is the first game console I have experience that lets you actually be part of the game."
5,my nintendo wii,My wife and I enjoy this game console so much we just bowl ourselves to sleep and then wake up wanting to play another three to four hours of excitement . Thank you Nintendo for this game it brought back joy into our lives . I'm 56 and my wife is 50 and wii still going...
3,Good value for money but adults will get bored,The Wii console and games are good value for the money. However my personal experience is that after the initial excitement is gone adults in the family will get bored of this. The reasoning that this will help you stay fit and provide exercise doesn't motivate you so much. If you are a family with young kids this is great to keep them engaged but a family of adults with busy routines will get bored in some time so please avoid impulse purchase.
5,x-mas surprise,"WiiI got this game system for my adult son. He lovesthe exercise that he gets with the tennis, bowling, & the other games.He plans to add Wii Fit as well as hunting games as he is an advid hunter.I was glad to get him something he enjoys & keeps him healthy.Amazon was great to work with & the sender had the game to my door in record time without me paying extra.I will continue to shop with Amazon."
5,Great for everyone,"I bought the Wii for myself and my parents and left it at my parent's place. To my great delight, my parents both enjoy playing the Wii possibly even more than I do! It's a great game for both young adults (like myself) and the older generation (like my parents). It's very user-friendly and anyone can pick it up and play. Helps get people moving and active again in fun ways."
5,The best value,My boys aged 9 and 13 loves this. They also have a playstation 3 and game cube but this wii is what they play the most. It is the best value for the money when it comes to video game consoles and the best thing is it gets the kids up and moving instead of just sitting in front of the tv. It is the best investment I have made for a long time.
4,My Wii buying experience,"Though I have to return it for some power problem, Amazon's customer service handled it perfectly. They sent the replacement ASAP, no questions asked. Additionally, I was able to use my deferred payment credit card. Wii is a great game console!"
5,Grampa's toy,I purchased the Wii for my grandaughter but after i set it up and played on it i renamed it Grampa's Wii. She visits on the weekends but during the week it's mine...All mine
3,"family oriented, for the casual gamer","A family gaming system that is O.K. With all the hype I was expecting more. Most games are geared towards little kids, which was to be expected. Why no HD? Many people that rate it 5 stars say ""It's the game play not graphics"" I agree to a point, but in this day and age there is no excuse not to have HD and to me it only enhances the game play experience. And if it's game play the're worried about then I'm sorry to say that I have found few games I consider fun. The sports games are fun but the redundent motion gets old quick. The bowling is fun when having a party! For ages 4-9 and 50+. My wife likes it but I will stick with my 360."
3,Internet connection difficult,Instructions loop around but don't resolve the problem with connecting to the internet. Can waste way too much time on this. Don't even want to try doing this all again with tech support. Much more fruitful to bag it and do more constructive things.
5,Wii,The Wii came quick and before schedule date. It is a lot of fun and we love playing with it. IT seems that everyone has a Wii.
5,Family Fun!,The Wii is an absolute blast that brings family fun back center stage. My youngest (six years old) is a bowling manic! The sports games are incredibly fun. We can't wait for Wii Play to release in February.
4,"Its fresh, its new, its fun!","Just got this today from a local store. It looks great and works wonderfully. Very easy to set up. Its got a learning curve to it, but I think its a pleasant change to the gaming industry. The only thing negative I have to say about it is its graphics, which are maybe a little better than the original Xbox. Expected more from Nintendo, but I think the revolutionary playing style makes up for the lack of good graphics.My advice to you: If you really want the Wii, buy it locally, you'll save at least $100. I ain't payin no 400 bucks for it and 1 game.. lol"
5,THE WII ROCKS!!!,"I think that the wii is the greatest living console out there. It beats the 360 and the PS3 by a mile. The best part is the Wiimote. You actually get to interact with some of the games unlike most console games where you just sit there and use the controller. I like the Wii Channels especially shopping because of the old generation games like Donkey Kong and things like that. I got my Wii on ebay and it sold for a reasonable price and Buy It Now, but my dad bid on like 10 of them but we got outbid on all of them. It took a while to get here but once we got it me and my sister started playing it instantly. My sister's thinking about getting Warioware smooth moves, also. In conclusion the wii is the greatest console in my opinion. Also I love the boxing game, too."
5,"Take out your cash, IT'S SO WORTH IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","I'm a 11 year old girl with a 15 year old brother and a 9 year old sister. I had no interest in this gaming system until I went to the Nintendo World Store in NYC. I tried out the Wii and I absolutly LOVED IT! Luckily, they were in stock so my mom and dad got one for us! I recommend you get more than one controler. It's so cool! It comes with 5 different sports: Baseball, Tennis, Bowling, Golf, and Boxing. It's a fun thing to do with my whole family! On New Years Eve, we were bowling, playing tennis, and a playing a little baseball. We all loved it so much we bought the Zelda game. It's tons of fun. GET THE WII! IT'S AWESOME!"
5,Great!,"This is a very awesome system. The system itself is beautiful, small and pefectly designed. The graphics power of the system is slightly better then the old Xbox. But if you have an HDTV, I recommend buying Component cables for the Nintendo Wii. It will make games look way better.As for the gameplay, It is quite enjoyable. It's easy to learn how to use the remote for anyone. It's truly a game system for family and friends. My Dad was able to quickly learn how to play some golf on Wii Sports. He is horrible when it comes to learning how to play games, or use electronics. He don't even know how to turn on a PC. It's amazing how much they can do with the remote and nunchuck. I can't wait to see what kind of games will come out in 2007.I recomend this system to anyone who likes playing with their friends or family. If you value gameplay over graphics, then you came to the right place. Nintendo Wii is gonna rock yo' socks."
1,Big mistake,"Totally upset with this Wii order! It came with NO original packaging, no instructions, and the cord connection was broken.......I bought this as an ""extra"" Christmas gift for my husband. We wanted the older version because we wanted the sports package that was supposed to be with it - and we didn't even get that either!I will hesitate buying used games, etc from now on."
2,Atari 2600 repeating itself???,"I'll try to keep this short. If Nintendo would clamp down and prevent bad games from being published I would have more respect for this console. I own a Wii and a PS3. The novelty of the motion controller wears off and both 360 and ps3 have one coming. A game doesn't have to have the best graphics (Zelda) to be good and it is way too far between a Galaxy or Zelda. I barely touch the Wii and even though I don't own one, I would recommend someone by an Xbox 360 over a Wii if they want to get more value for their money. A lot of people weren't around when the 2600 came out.... and left. Look up rhe wiki entry of shovelware. Nintendo needs to learn from Atari. We study history so we don't repeat it."
2,most over-rated console of all time,"It seems a lot of non-gamers love this system, as well as everyone under 12 years old. I wish this system had more games catered to an adult gamer audience(this does not include old people and your girlfriend but actual gamers). Almost every decent game features a cartoon plummer with a mean butt stump or an elf kid(Zelda) or something like that. It's too bad because I would like to play Gears of War, Halo, Resistance Fall of Man, Metal Gear and more with a wii-mote, that might be cool. This is a good system overall if it were under a hundred bucks but it's way over-priced at $[...]. That's insane for something so technologically inferior to the competition."
3,The Nintendo Wii does not exist,"I played this system at a party one night. It was, in fact, the most fun I have had playing a console game in years. I left knowing that I would have to purchase one of these systems for myself. However, the next day I realized a great and shocking truth. The Nintendo Wii does not exist. I searched stores all around town only to be left unfulfilled. I searched online where vendors even as illustrious as Amazon were unable to sell me this device. However, Amazon was able to point me to several digital back alleys where I could purchase the aforementioned product at a mere 58 to 260% markup. However, I feared to go into those alleys as graduate study at a university is not conducive to such an immoderate lifestyle. That and I didn't want to wake up in a bathtub full of ice without a kidney. So, I sit in limbo, my fate ruled by the iron fist of an Italian plumber and his multi-national corporation hell-bent on allowing our desires to stagnate and fester."
2,"Fun to start, but alas...","When the Wii was first announced, I was a little scared that Nintendo was treading in uncharted waters. I had always been a hardcore Nintendo fan so I wanted them to succeed, that's why I got it the day it was released.The Wii has great potential because I believe it is beginning the path that videogames need to take. Videogames have the potential of easily transitioning into more personal experiences, like in ""Minority Report."" I gave Nintendo the benefit of the doubt but as time passed I realized they were not attempting to make a splash, only a ripple.After a year, regret set in. If I could some how keep my virtual console games for perhaps the Wii2 or 3, I would sell this thing in a heartbeat!!!!! I periodically turn it on bi-monthly and the only thing that mildly interests me is the Vote Channel. At least it collects dust efficiently!!"
2,XBOX is MUCH better,"I was really anxious and anticipating a lot of fun times with Wii but unfortuneately I have played with an XBOX first. There is NO comparison. It just isn't as life like. The characters movements are choppy, the sensitivity to your movements isn't as detailed and the set up is lengthy and boring. Sorry I bought it. However, if you have never done either one, I'm sure you'd like it."
3,"Wii Misses Some Marks, But Hits Most of Then","The Wii is overall a good console. It has a few flaws, but it's pretty goodProsgood games includingThe Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess 100% (rotten tomatoes)Wario Ware: Smooth Moves 100% (rotten tomatoes)Trauma Center: Second Opinion 90% (rotten tomatoes)Madden NFL 07 88% (rotten tomatoes),innovate controllers, virtual console and Gamecube backwards compatibility making it like having every Nintendo console to date, built in Wi-FiConsWeak Graphics and Sound, No Hard drive, no HD, 2nd Rate Online Service, sold for a profit (the 360 and the PS3 both sell at a loss)I really like the Wii, it's fun it's cheap, it's pretty easy to play. It may not be suitable for hardcore gamers, but for gamers that just want to have fun the Wii hits just the spot."
4,"Wii is fun, fun fun!!!","I had seen the Nintendo Wii in friends' homes before and I thought it was... OK... I wasn't really THAT impressed. When (after my wife asked for one) I bought it, I realized that it is GREAT FUN!!! Buy one, play it and enjoy it! It is worth the relatively small investment anyway!"
4,Fun for all ages,"I was so happy to find this product on Amazon before Christmas. My 12 year old son loves playing the Wii Sports games that were included. This system has been fun for the whole family. The console has overheated and locked up once after a few hours of play--apparently there is a cooling fan you can purchase seperately, but it seems like that is a design flaw that Nintendo should address in the future."
5,Very hard to get but well worth the effort,"It took me a while to find this product. I wanted to have it for a surprise christmas gift. I got lucky and found it here at Amazon. I can't even tell you how great this product is, you can do lot's with it. My whole family loves it. I enjoy that you can download the old-school games from the nintendo system. I think this is a great system to start out with if you have small children. Very family friendly...."
3,A FUN AND INTERESTING WAY TO PLAY GAMES... BUT,"Being 26. I grew up playing nintendo. My roots came from them. I grew up and the games became to simple and childish for me. Sure its a fun console... and i'll always love Mario and his games.. but there are no more challenges for me in that console.The Wii is a great Console for kids. My cousin owns one and it's fun when the kids are around. The fun factor doesn't last too long though... especially when you're playing solo.I currently own a PS3... and yes, i am a die hard playstation fan. And i do realize that their fan base is pointed more directly from teens to adults. The PlayStation 3 is a super machine and... sooner or later will take the lead for the NEXT GEN CONSOLES."
4,Sort of Bores You After Awhile,"This system really is SO much fun when you buy it for the first time. It will last 5 days or less though. Im sad to say that nintendo didnt beat the ps3 but sort of tied with the Xbox360. My dad gave me a choice of the wii or the ps3 and I chose the wii at first. After I played a demo I realized that the wii got boring after a while. The graphics dissapoint me and the motion is an arm killer (And sometimes a TV killer). The launch titles are pretty fun but the motion gets annoying.Its really fun for awhile and I recomend it to people who are desperate for a 7th generation system and arent in the mood to spend 350-400 bucks on a 360, or 600-800 bucks on a ps3.By the way, I got the ps3 and its much better than the wii. Think of it as a wii and an XBox360 put together.Oh whatever, im 12 who would listen to a kids review?"
1,Very Disappointed,"I saved for a year to purchase this system for my kids. They wanted one last year but I was a single parent. When Amazon notified me in November that one was available I bought it immediately and was very happy to have it under the tree for them. We enjoyed it immediately....played Rock Band 2 during Christmas weekend but when Monday came my youngest went to turn it on and NOTHING. Change the plug and try again and NOTHING. Tried all of the plugs in the house before boxing it up and sending it back to Amazon who doesn't have any replacements. For this type of money I would expect it to work longer than a weekend. I contacted Nintendo and got the whole ""stuff happens"" explaination but that doesn't replace my money nor does it help with the aggravation of recreating everything we did that weekend TOGETHER. I wouldn't suggest not buying it because when it worked it was great. But hold on to your receipt and don't expect the normally reliable Amazon to replace it when it doesn't work."
1,Wii Sucks.,"Dont buy a wii. unless, of course, you want a broken, useless system with the worst games known to man. nintendo thinks that just cuz people are wowed by the motion sensitivity, they wont care about the game. when the wii was released, nintendo made like 5 good games. since then, nothing. get a x360 and save[....]."
5,Great fun for a Grandmother,"Our grown son recommended we get the Wii for fun and fitness. We are in our mid fifties and found the game to be very user friendly. In talking with others our age, we have found that there are some closet ""Wii-ers"" out there or those that want to be. It is easy to install and you can start playing a game within 30 minutes. We would highly recommend it for older adults like us."
5,This is absolutely a remarkable entertainment device!,"After I received mine, after a while later, I took the unit to my office, kept it there for a week and let people experience with it.The result is 2 people ordered their own set and the management decided to get one for the entire office. What an easy sell for such an expensive unit? Yes, xbox or playStation may offer superior graphics or games, but they won't get you moving. It's this ""exercise aspect"" that would cause you to fell in love with this.Here is another way to look at it. If the following does not sum it up, I don't know whatelse will.My 4 and 6 year old daughters enjoy it, I (40) enjoy it and everybody else I know of enjoy it.Bottom line is go for it. Once you get it & you get good at it, you'll probably would get a [...] account to sample games without buying them. Some games are better than others and it is a personal choice.Good luck!"
5,We LOVE the Wii !!!,"I bought the Wii mostly with my ten-year-old daughter in mind. I have been BEYOND pleased with how much the entire family has enjoyed playing the Wii. My 72-year-old mother-in-law even likes it! It's an awesome party game and the included ""sports package"" provides hours of fun. I would recommend buying an extra remote and nunchuck because most of the games are more fun when played in multiplayer mode. If you have more than 2 children, I would probably purchase 3 extra remotes and nunchucks. Several of the games can support 4 players. The ""Wii Play"" game comes with a remote and like 9 games and at $5 more than the remote alone, it's a no-brainer purchase. The Wii is not comparable to a PS3 or XBOX for graphics, hard drive, etc. but that is not what makes it great. The motion-sensing controllers and user-friendly gameplay are what make Wii a top seller. Everyone I know who has one loves it. I'm completely satisfied with this purchase."
2,Just for kids,"The wii is great for younger kids. It can be fun for adults for a LITTLE while but quickly gets old. This is a neat little unit, but for anyone with kids older than ten should really consider the PS3 or xbox 360."
3,FLAW: A SINGLE REMOTE,"I have two kids and both were very disappointed by the fact that they weren't able to play together. The Wii should come with two remotes!It's a terrible flaw. Because of this, my children haven't paid much attention to the game..."
5,SUPER!!,"Get the Wii! The remote as a motion sensor! And Wii sports comes with it FREE! When you play tennis, you actually have to swing the remote as if you are really playing it! And one of the best parts about it is you can download any Nintendo game from the NES to the N64! And in the Wii, if you are playing boxing or any other sport, you are have lots of fun while at the same time, you are getting lots of exercise! The Wii is very cool and it is much cheaper than the PS3! Get this! It is worth it!"
5,Wii is great for anyone of any age,"The Wii is a perfect game for anyone of any age. It is simple enough to figure out but the standard games have something for everyone. Wii Bowling seems to be a great family hit. The baseball seems to be a little harder to figure out and not as much fun but is still good-especially if you are home alone and looking for something to play by yourself. All of the game included in the Wii console are great and seem to be a hit. I would recommend this product to anyone looking to buy a video game. Another great thing is the fact Wii allows parental controls. Therefore, you can monitor what games your children are playing even when you aren't around."
5,Delayed Gratification,"As I read the posts on this product, I am struck by our generations inability to delay gratification. We've lived without this product our whole lives: Amazon says they will be shipping throughout the holiday season: I think we need to be patient. That said, I am really mad for the kid that waited in line, only to have all the adults take the tickets."
2,Over rated,"The Wii is no good. And by no good I mean it has very few games worth buying. The hardware itself is slow (you will never see games with realistic sword fights or anything like that) and the online is very weak (when you can barely communicate with the people you are playing with, I don't even see the point). There are maybe 5 or 6 games worth buying for it other than ports and nothing worth while coming out in the near future. I recommend buying an Xbox 360 or Playstation 3 well before considering a Wii. My Wii has mostly been collecting dust since I got bored of the latest Smash Brothers."
3,Pretty good,"This is the first video game we have ever had, it's fun, but you may want to buy extra games, Wii Sports gets kinda blaa after a while, also, you will want theWii Charge Station, Power runs out fast! Tennis is fun, I would let anyone from ages 5-100 years to play it, Golf...well...it's hard, maybe only 15-100 year olds will want to play it without getting mad at it!! Baseball is also a little on the hard side, hitting the ball is hard...ages 8-100years, Bowling ALL AGES!!! Fun, easy, etc. Creating a ""Mi"" for yourself is also fun, we made one that looks JUST LIKE our dad! In fact, all my brother likes to do on Wii is make ""Mi""s!"
5,Wii are having fun!,"Our family receieved this for Christmas and we're having such a fun time.I really like the Mii's. You can set up a character that you like and get this..they can be tall,short,thick and slim with many more options. The Find Mii game is cute and fun.My arms were soo sore from playing some of the games.The unit is small and does'nt take up alot of space. Good fun for the whole family."
5,"Wii, the smart game console","Not only is this game fun, but its smart too. The wiimote turns off when you turn the console off. It's very user friendly and can almost sense what you're trying to accomplish to help you complete the task.It's a lot of help for parents who played games before the memory card era. Oh, yes and parents I almost guarantee you'll love Wii sports more than your children, so every once in a while pretend like you got thissystem for them -to throw them off."
4,Woo-HOOOOO!!!! Thank you Amazon!!!,"After staying up until 12:30 EST, then setting my alarm to get back online at 3am EST, waiting for an hour, and then being on since 9 am EST this morning, I was FINALLY rewarded with a brief ""available"" when I refreshed my screen - my Wii from Amazon should be here this week! I thank you and my kids thank you for finally making this available."
2,My daughter said ''Wii is boring'',"My daughter loved the wii when she first got it for Christmas and on September or October she said the wii is boring. She plays Call of Duty World at War on my brother's PS3 because she likes playing Nazi Zombies and she neverstops playing it because she likes it. So she should get a PS3 or an Xbox 360. She hates the wii now. The good thingabout the wii is it has Mario games and she likes Mario games. The bad things about the wii is: poor game choices for her to choose, no Nazi zombies on Call of Duty world at war on the wii version, and not too much mature games. My daughter likes hardcore games. All of her wii games are to easy for her. Buy the PS3 or Xbox 360."
2,The Wii is pretty disappointing overall.,"The Wii could be, and should be, great. But it's not. I'm a dad with a 10 year old son. The best game we've played is Wii Sports which comes with the console. That's pretty sad. The controllers should lead to some creative games, but most of the games have been pretty awful. Mario Olympics is pretty good. Lego Batman was pretty good- and used the controls well. Tiger Woods golf is pretty much unplayable due to bad controls. Many other games are really poorly done, like all of the Carnival Games, Mini-Golf, etc. Wii Sports is fun for get togethers, and creating Wii characters is pretty fun. Other than that, just about any other gaming system is 99% better. I'm sticking with PC gaming myself."
5,Fa-Wii,"Great system I always have a Nintendo system as my other console...The motion control/nunchuk is soo different. At first you may be like, huh? But, after a bit of Tennis or Baseball, etc. it is very cool!!! It's a fun system but you also get excersice with the physical interaction. My son loves it and the price is nice.BTW, the wireless adapter built in to the Wii is funny and may need to be refreshed a bit to see your SSID, happened to me when all pda/laptops see it immediately.I gave a 4 for the slow internet, lack of digital sound and HD support and shortage on component video cables, but the innovation and excercise factors (price, too) kinda make up for that.I can't wait for Mario Galaxy and RE: Umbrella Chronicles!!! Anybody played Rayman Raving Rabbids??? Looks like fun, would like some input on it."
5,Excellent Service,I bought this system thinking that something would be wrong with it since it was used but I was surprised when I received the product. It was packaged nicely and all the parts were in very good condition. I received my purchase in a timely manner and now I can enjoy playing Mario and Donkey Kong!!!
2,What was I thinking?,"Okay, so I use to be a Nintendo fan boy, and then I got a Wii. The wii is literally a glorified game cube. It has game cube graphics and processors, no hd and no proper controller for most games. This thing is a piece of junk. And there are next to no games to play for it. Seriously, once you have beat brawl you are out of games to play. Save your money and buy a real game console. Why would Nintendo betray us like this?"
4,Just waiting for some games,"I've owned the Wii for about 6 months now and I wouldn't trade it for a 360 or PS3 for anything. I love the way that the controllers make every game more interactive. I've yet to play anything that didn't play better, or was at least more satisfying, when I played it standing on my feet.And those same controls have already sucked in several family members who wouldn't otherwise dream of playing a video game. But they all love the Wii.Definitely, there's been a dearth of decent games (particularly those that really take good advantage of the controller). But there have been enough to tide me and my Wii-lovin' 5-year-old over until we get some goodies later this year. My X-mas list is already locked in at a single item: Guitar Hero 3.If you've got a family, or if you're just tired of the same-old-same-old in console gaming, get yourself a Wii. You won't regret it."
5,Wii,"The only reason I'm getting a wii is to play the sims 3 on which comes out October 26th. The wii version has exclusives the ps3 and 360 don't like swimming in the ocean,weather,sun bathing,sun burn,jet skiing,houseboats and so much more. All 3 console versions allow your sims total freedom like the pc version thou there is a very fast loading screen when going to community lots from the home lot but no loading screens when going from community lot to community lot.This is the reason I'm getting a wii because I'm an avid sims fan and I also plan on getting sims 3 late night for the pc which streets the same day as the console versions."
4,The first of its kind really,"They're have been other products like this, but this is probably the best aimed. The Wii is cool, its fun especially for all ages, for me though it just doesn't last as long as other consoles - the fun I mean, it doesn't seem like you're in control as much as you should be when playing the games. It will get better, definitely worth buying though. I've never met a person that hasn't liked it, and thats been like 3 years."
4,Great System For the Whole Family!,"I have really enjoyed the Nintendo Wii over the last year. While we go through stages on non-usage, I always seem to find my way back to it. This is a great system to play and enjoy with family and friends.One of the greatest things about the Wii is that there is a very small learning curve. So not only can my Wife enjoy the Wii but so can my Mother! The Wii is a great system for casual gamers and will be a great system for years to come!"
3,WII entertainment console.,Great for games and fun. Not so great for internet! I like playing the interactive sports. This will get you off the couch for sure! Thanks for reading my review!
3,it's ok,"The novelty wears off after a while with the wii remote. It has some great games, if only a handful. If you can get this a bargain price, get it. You will enjoy the classic nintendo games. Nintendo is the best in the busness at first party games. Sadly they are generally the worst at third party games. Crappy budget titles bleed from the library. It is a great system for family fun too. Wii bowling is one of the best games period. It's also a very reliable system too. Unlike the 360...In my opinion, if you want to get a new system, go with PS3 or Xbox 360.Mine collects dust. I turn it on once in a while to play bowling with my daughter or play mario galaxy, mario cart, last story, or rabidds go home. Those rabbits are a riot. Better yet, wait to get the wii u. wii is pretty much done at this point and the wii u is going to be able to play wii games."
5,the best product for kids,I like very much this product.My kids are happy after they played wii games. I am going to buy another wii gameproduct.Thank you very much
3,Wii,"Bought to entertain my 6yr old son and watch Netflix.....not a very good game selection. Either too girly or too violent. Some tumbling or basic karate moves....not bloody, violent fighting but blocking and defensive movements would be a nice change. A self defense game.....instead of racing a defensive driving game would be good."
5,Amazing and Great workout :),My family loves the new Wii. Definitely worth the money. Its great that theres movement involved in playing the games (good exercise).
5,Party Machine,"We have Wii parties with our friends, and I have to limit the invites - it is too popular. Everyone has a blast - no one talks about whether or not it is ""better"" than the other systems - they just have a great time. Playing solo is also a lot of fun - there are plenty of great games out there to keep you entertained (but also a lot of bad games - be selective). This may not be the system of choice for the ""hardcore gamer"", but for average folk looking for a good time, the Wii is perfect."
5,Great Gaming System,"I purchased the Wii for my children. I opened it and hooked it up, which was very easy to do, I played for hours boxing, golfing, bowling. I had a great time and I know my kids will love it. I like the Wii because it is designed to get your kids up and be active even if you are playing video games. I LOVE THE Wii"
3,Does not play GameCube games.,"Note that this version does NOT play GameCube games. Apart from that, it's a Wii. It plays Wii games, and there are a bunch of them."
5,Love it,I bought this and the Wii fit plus w/balance board and I am amazed at its capabilities....It is great fun and who even knows you are excercising at the same time...I would highly recommend it to all ages !!!!
5,WII is the king!,"I was skeptical about the Wii. How different could it be?Requiring physical motions for sporting games (Wii Sports) is fantastic! The tennis and baseball are all about swing timing (early vs. late). The golf and bowling are about angle of the controller (slice in golf, spin in bowling). My 6-year old son is unbeatable in bowling!A fantastic and fun product for all ages!"
5,"Wii, indeed","I was fairly skeptical about all of the enthusiasm regarding the Will -- after all, how different could it really be from other platforms?All I can say now is, Nintendo -- forgive me for having doubted you.It really *is* fun for the entire family. It really *is* easy to setup and use. It really *is* the most interactive video game experience I have ever seen.It is the best value in video gaming, and well worth the wait."
5,The best and the cheapest game console right now.,"Get the Wii! The remote as a motion sensor! And Wii sports comes with it FREE! When you play tennis, you actually have to swing the remote as if you are really playing it! And one of the best parts about it is you can download any Nintendo game from the NES to the N64! And in the Wii, if you are playing boxing or any other sport, you are have lots of fun while at the same time, you are getting lots of exercise! The Wii is very cool and it is much cheaper than the PS3! Get this! It is worth it!"
5,Awesome Wiiiiiiiiiiii,"My family is really enjoying the Wii. They play it just about everyday. I broke my leg just a couple days after I ordered it, so I haven't played it as much as I'd like, but as soon as I can move around more, I definitely will."
4,Satisfied,"I purchased the WII system with two goals, to get my wife and myself moving (using WII Fit and the balance board), and to try my hand at gaming again (after a multiple year layoff). I'm quite satisfied with the workouts offered by the WII FIT system, and it's pretty easy for me to stay interested in daily excersize. My only complaint is that there is much more empahsis on snappy movement, as opposed to good form.As for gaming, I purchased Call of Duty Reflex and the Zapper remote holder. As expected it took me a day or so to get up to speed with the aiming, movement, an such, but once I got the hang of it, it took me about 12 days of play (a couple of hrs at a time) to complete all missions in the game and open the Arcade Mode. I greatly enjoyed the game, with the only complaint being the graphics quality, (but I didn't expect great graphics from the WII)Overall I gave the system 4 stars."
5,Fun for the whole family,"I was against buying this thinking that we would never use it. How wrong I was! Even our three year old has been able to play with the bowling, tennis and boxing. Since purchasing this, we also purchased the Wii Fit. Very fun and motivational. I try to use it every day."
5,Family Time & Challenges,"So its official, my family and I have become a ""Wii"" family! We've always been video game enthusiasts, we own all of the other consoles, but we put off on adding a wii for quite sometime.Now that we own a wii, I have to admit, I LOVE IT! If you're feeling a little frustrated and you can't make it out to the court, then turn on the wii. Looking for something to do as a family and tired of watching movies, then turn on the wii. Looking for a challenge, then turn on the wii!It's gotten so that we have a sign up sheet so we can get equal playing time and we are always trying to hone up on our skills."
5,Wii,We love it. We are not very tech saavy and usually have difficulty setting up things like this. The instructions were easy to follow as far as hooking up to the TV but we did have some difficulty trying to figure out how to get it to work with the satellite dish connection on the TV. Our satellite company help desk couldn't help us but we finally found a friend who knew what we needed to do to program the satellite remote control to get it to work. So our problem was not with Wii but with the dish company. The games are fun for adults and for kids and we are addicted.
5,Sports,The sports game that comes with the WII system is great. It is easy to do and not difficult to set up.
5,A must have for video game lovers,I resisted the Wii but gave in when the prices went down. Wish I got it sooner. Great system and really fun to play games with more involvement on the player's part then just pushing buttons or a joy stick.
4,Still Going,My son's had the Wii for a couple of years now and it is still working beautifully. We have experienced no problems whatsoever with it.He likes to play different game systems and probably spends equal amounts of time playing the Wii or PS or PC games. He has several games for the Wii and the family has enjoyed Sports and Guitar Hero the most. Mario Kart is a lot of fun as well. I like the steering wheel although I think it takes a little getting used to.
4,Wii for the Disabled,Got the Wii console for my wife who is disabled with multilpe sclerosis. She is able to play Wii Sports from her wheelchair. Good exercise and helps with hand/eye coordination.
5,Not usually a gamer...but I am now!,"I don't usually play video games. That's because I married one of those gamer nerds who generally beats me at everything. What's the fun in that?Well...the fun is now the Wii! Because he's used the PS2 and the Dreamcast and all those older models, he's not so great on the Wii. Where this item was manufactured for people like me...spazzes!Thanks to the Wii, when I jerk and bend and twist and jump, so does my game! I love it!"
1,False Product Description,"This is the THIRD Nintendo Wii I've ordered from a THIRD different seller. All of them claimed that this particular Wii unit was backwards compatible with Nintendo GameCube games and most peripherals. Being that I'm trying to put away my GameCube and consolidate game systems, this was the main thing I was looking for. I'm now in the process of returning the THIRD Wii console in the past 1.5 months because of false advertisement in the product description. Amazon.com, you really need to take some type of action on sellers that put this false information in the product description - this is rediculous."
3,WHY ALL THE HYPE,I WAS BUGGING AND BUGGING MY GRAMA TO GET ME THE WII AND I MEAN BUGGING!I TRADED IN MY PS2 AND GAMES TO GET THIS SYSTEM. FINALLY THEY STARTED GETTING MORE WIIS IN ALL THE STORES SO I GOT ONE. I WAS SO EXCITED THAT I PLAYED IT FOR 8 HOURS NON STOP. BUT THEN FOR SOME REASON I JUST STOPPED. I WANNA PLAY IT AT THIS MOMENT BUT FOR SOME REASON IM JUST NOT. I STILL THINK YOU SHOULD GET IT THOUGH. ITS KINDA WORTH IT
1,Unhappy camper,I was very disappointed when my son opened his present and set it up and it didn't work. Nothing the manual suggested we do worked. It has been resolved(by calling the Wii company) but he had to wait more than a week to play it.
1,a complete waste of 250$.,"i bought the wii in summer 2007, thinking it would be really fun, sadly it was the worst thing i could ever think of spending 250$ on. the games are mostly crap, there is just a handfull of actual games on wii, and only about 5 or so that are somewhat worth playing. most games currently being released are either for very stupid children, or thier even more stupid parents who think a balance board is considered a game. currently i have only 8 wii games, the last one i purchased was super smash bros. which was in april 2008. the PS3 AND XBOX360 are way better purchases and offer actual games not some crap that looks like a mentally challenged ape designed it."
4,The Wii is fun for everyone.,"Most of my friends and I are not ""gamers,"" but we've all been able to find something fun about the Wii. That what I like about it so much, I'm not wasting my time trying to memorize which buttons do what, I just just play some fun games. It's quite intuitive."
4,A Wii for my parents,"We enjoyed our Wii so much, my parents hinted that they would like one too. They are senior citizens, but heard about the benefits of Wii Fit and thought it would be a good way to stay fit."
4,Video games - one handed !,"The Wii is amazing for most people and simply wonderful for everybody else. I used to play video games ages ago. Now with Wii most of the games provided by default (Wii Sports) can be played with only one hand and a little flick of the wrist.. there are plenty more such games.I brought the Wii to my office once and after just one session the team decided to get a team Wii for use in office (after hours of course :)The Wii is amazing at getting people to exercise. Yeah, you don't just slouch in a couch; with a Wii you do have to sweat it out and it's a thousand times more enjoyable than just exercising your fingers.I highly recommend this game for anyone with one or more hands.cheers :)"
1,Collecting Dust,"I was very excited to finally recieve a Wii but then I was only disapointed when I actually played it. They almost pulled off the motion sensing controller but it just does not work very well. Games are a major problem with this system, they're hardly any games worth owning in its selection and hardly any have internet. Ours now collects dust in our living room; bottom line it is not a very good system."
1,Nintendo Wiiiiiiiiii!!!!!,yeah wii is pretty fun but not all the time. but i bet everybody that if the ps3 or the xbox 360 were the same price of the wii there wouldnt be any ps3 or xbox 360 at the stores. yeah i own the three of them but i like my ps3 better the xbox360 goes second and the wii third. wii doesnt even have online right now and that makes it boring. and i don't like the graphics of it it looks like a gamecube but with a new controller. well guy u decide not me so go out there and buy anything you want and don't listen to whatever the other people says its your decision not theirs.thanks.
1,Fun but so poorly built it never works,"Our Wii lasted three weeks before it died and it died a slow painful death becoming more and more unstable and quirky untit it just didnt work at all. One remote died with 5 days so we bought another for the bargain price of $[...]! Fun game but machine is built to such poor standards that it is unusable. Our neighbors has a similar history. Good luck getting warranty nowadays. Pure profit margin, no quality. Avoid."
2,Wii would like to play...,"Wii do not own the consol, altho wii would like to. I have read the first 10 reviews on this item, and have to say, I'm leery about spending 300+ $ on another new system with so few games available for it. I've been told the ""GameCube"" games are combatible. That's good, since I spent all that money on the gamecube consol, and we have maybe 15 good games. Go to the store to buy games-there are about 3000 playstation games and maybe 150 gamecube games...Nintendo, What's up w/that?"
3,The Nintendo,"Why...No. When will DK make his triumphant return. For 64 it was great. Nothing for GC. Now, nothing for Wii either. Mario isn't even here...Luigi maybe ? No, none of the classics. Well, I guess Nintendo is trying to move on. I believe they should have stuck to there characters. I'm pretty sure Xbox won't be letting go of their Halo. I'm dissapointed in you Nintendo. My love is dying."
3,Wii Game Console,"It was a little bit yellow in some places and needed a good cleaning, but overall it was great. It shipped to me much quicker than expected and I really appreciated that. For the price that I paid for it, it was perfect. All pieces were included with a few bonuses that I didn't expect (SD Card and Wii points), so it was absolutely worth the purchase!!"
3,Not for Everyone,"The Wii was interesting and got a lot of buzz when it first released, but it wasn't for hardcore gamers. It had it's time in the spotlight, but it seems like the gaming industry is moving back to the more typical route and focusing on quality games, rather than trying something new. Hopefully the Wii U will be able to blend the best of both worlds."
4,Great buy,"Wanted an affordabe, gently used Wii console to go with my new Wii Fit...very pleased with my purchase. Great quality and value. Will purchase a used product again."
2,LAME!,Ok the Wii was kicking butt until Microsoft came out with Kinect for the Xbox Which is the same only no remote its all body controlled so it forces you to exercise unlike the Wii where you can sit on the couch and just be worken the biceps. In other words don't waste money on this product the Xbox for one hundred bucks more gives you more stuff and internal game storage.
4,Fun for family,"Great fun for the family, not meant for a hard core multiplayer online fanatic like my self. The extended family has forced me to buy batteries at costco but it's well worth it! I love this system when it comes to family entertainment and also brings out the competitiveness in even the most subtle people. Love the system, hate the available online issues, but you know what? This is about getting the family together and enjoying each others company. Want to bring the family together? Fork over the $200 and enjoy!"
5,"So good, we have two - one for each!","We bought a Wii for one of the kids last year. When the other one went off to college and took the Wii for a semester, the kids decided to trade systems at break. The older one liked it so well, he kept it at college for the year. So, this year we bought another system for the younger one. The Wii gets you up off the couch and moving! No more couch potatoes video-gamers...but, if you have someone with limited mobility who wants to play, they can have just as much fun. And theres something for everyone with varying ability levels. You dont have to be good to have fun :)"
2,Fun doesn't last,"I didn't grow up playing video games, nor do I own another gaming system. While the Wii's wireless interface was originally appealing, it got boring fast. There still aren't too many games that really appeal to gaming newbies, and this is a rather expensive purchase to play ""Wii Sports"" and ""Mario Kart"" once a month. Bottom line: if you don't care for video games already, this won't make you like them much more. If you want to play tennis and bowling, you can spend less on a racket and the appropriate shoes and get out of the house."
3,CAUTION: Strap does break... it is not a joke!!,"We purchased the Wii last week and have played it three nights. Tonight, the strap broke while my son was playing tennis and flew through the Christmas tree destroying several ornaments. After inspecting the strap, there is a *very* cheap string that connects the strap to the controller itself and that is what broke. I believe Nintendo clearly has a product defect with the strap... it is much too weak (lasting less then three nights w/ a 13 yr. old boy breaking it).Fun system... but when I saw that remote flying full speed into our Christmas tree it was not a joke... I was relieved it did not fly at one of my other kids!"
3,"Pretty fun, but...","I love the interaction with the Wii system and overall it is really fun. However, the hardware is giving me a headache. When I bought the Wii I was under the impression that the Wii remote and console work with all Gamecube games, which is only half true. Yes, Gamecube games work on the Wii but not the remote and I don't know about the classic controller. I just bought a 2nd remote with Mario Kart Double Dash and it does not work with the Wii remote, only the Gamecube controller. Now I have to try and return this game or return the remote for 2 controllers, which will ultimately not work with any of my Wii games. Again, overall, the Wii is great, but there is too much going on the the hardware. Sure, the system is one of the cheapest, compared to the PS3 and such, but you will add on a ton a money with the many different games and controllers that are compatible with the system."
5,Fun with WII,"Received the WII in record time, ordered and had the WII in about 4 days. Easy to setup and was having a ball in only a couple minutes. The only bad thing about the WII is how addicting it is. I would recommend this to everyone."
5,Bringing back the FUN to gaming,"I have only one word to describe this system, and its wow. I own a X-box and love it to bits, and I've always been somewhat, anti-nintendo. But this first system is a blast! I've had so much fun playing it, I don't even know why I'm writing this review. Only thing that gets annoying is the speaker in the controller, but its not enough to take down a star. Long live the Wii!"
2,Not as expected.,"When i first heard that the wii was coming out I was pretty excited but what was i excited for.When I heard that the wii was going to use motion in most of there games for the very first time, I was pretty overwhelmed. I first played this system at my friends house and was not very impressed. Maybe i shouldn't of thought of this but i was hoping for a system that would follow your bodie as a hole, not just a wii remote.People made a big stink over how the wii was the best system out. Want to know why people buy it? It's because they THINK it's cheap. When you add up all the costs of the wii like a balance board and new remotes and nunchuks, it get's to be even more costly then the other systems if you really want to get right down to it.Most people think that the wii is the best system out right now, I am one of the few who are not very impressed with it."
3,from fun to lame,"at first the wii is a blast. here you have something completly new. motion sensored gaming, a fresh take on the gaming world. then after a while it just gets old and boring. unless your playing with a group of friends or family, or you are a little kid this system just becomes a lame system. the graphics are no better than anyhting weve seen a decade ago. the game library is limited, very limited. 90 % kiddie games. I can only hope the next wii will have updated graphics along with more adult oriented games, that way the system will have more to offer to us old school gamers. guess im just picky, or maybe its because im not 9, but i want my gaming system to try to be the best there is. superior graphics, games that you can play for hours and hours and not get bored. the wii starts with a brilliant idea, but fall short in the long run when it comes to ultimate gaming."
4,Nintendo WII,"I love my Nintendo Wii. We couldn't find one anywhere until we decided to look on Amazon. There were several for sale! The first time fell through because they were out-of-stock, but Amazon let us know of another vendor who had them. Thank you Amazon! I use the sports application, especially the bowling game."
2,Wii Disc Failure,Bought the unit Christmas last year. Family has played it maybe 20-30 hours and now disc failure.Ta Da! In to the shop for repairs. The cost is not outrageous just disappointed that for $500.00 bucks in unit and gamesand accessories this is the disc life on this one.I know it's an inexpensive console but we're not talking Xbox 360 either. Just a simple format player.I'm just saying...
4,Playing the Wii at 56 years old,Great way to keep active during the long cold days of winter. My wife and I play 4 or 5 nights a week.Any advice on what other games to buy?
4,wii purchase at Amazon,I am very pleased with the Wii GAME console that I received from Amazon.com. It is easy to operate and easy to understand and lots of fun even for older folks.
5,New Awakening,I believe that all of us love the Wii and with those of us who are advanced in age (over 30)it brings about a new awakening of your body. I for one have strained and stressed muscles I didn't even know I had. The end result is be sure you exercise before you exercise or your body may revolt. The Wii is a blast if you are ready for it!
1,WARNING: NOT BACKWARDS COMPATIBLE,"I am outraged. My old Wii system broke and no longer reads my game discs, so I set out to replace it. I went through a lot of headache at the store accidentally buying the newer model that does not play Gamecube discs or allow the plug-in of Gamecube controllers, so I made sure I ordered an original model online so I could play my Gamecube cames (90% of my Wii usage). This product was advertised as BEING BACKWARDS COMPATIBLE, but it IS DEFINITELY NOT. This is the same newer model that I furiously returned to the store after the salesman had assured me it worked with Gamecube discs. I will be returning this letdown also and I hope none of you make the same mistake of being deceived by the seller here. DO NOT ORDER IF YOU WANT TO PLAY GAMECUBE GAMES OR USE GAMECUBE CONTROLLERS. IT IS NOT ACTUALLY BACKWARDS COMPATIBLE. Never ordering from this seller again."
4,Enjoy,"Got it to watch Netflix and for grandkids when they come to vist, Had no trouble setting it up with a little help from Nintendo. Glad I got it."
5,Wowee !! Wii !!,"I know, it's been around for 2 years or so. At least I didn't pay the more than $200 prices that it was going for when it was first released. What more can I say which hadn't been said about this machine. It's superb and it's certainly the most revolutionary way of playing video games that one can imagine.If you don't have one, buy one!"
5,We {heart} our Wii,We are a family of four and everyone loves the Wii. The 5 year old loves all the mini games. The 11 year old enjoys that there are so many party games to play with her friends. Daddy loves Tiger Woods and is looking forward to Madden! Mommy loves the Virtual Console to play all the games I played as a kid!The only drawback is the lack of sports games available. If you are a sports game fanatic you are better off with an xbox 360.
5,very interactively fun,"wii sports that was included with the wii is fun. the best game is tennis...actually, I have not tried baseball. but, golf is okay. tennis is fun, keeps you playing and playing. component cables are not included and you need to buy them if you have a high-def tv. they made a huge difference!!!!!!! you can get them on the cheap on ebay. all in all a great system...I need to buy more games."
5,Great Fun for all ages!,"WiiWe got this for ourselves and have found this product easy to use as well as a lot of fun! Bowling is our favorite because we find it competitive, but less strenuous than going to the bowling alley. We like the variety of the games and the numerous choices that can be added. It is great to be able to recreate ourselves in the form of a mii. That is so cool! We aren't seniors yet, but we are close and the wii gives us an opportunity to be active indoors, especially in the Chicago winter!"
5,It's the best use for your TV!,"An excellent product that easy to use and fun to play. I've purchased many computer games but they all ended up being ignored after a few days. After a month we still look forward to playing Wii Sports and getting a safe, low-impact workout. I just wish it was easier to get the Wii Fit program!It is certainly better to spend time working with the Wii rather than watching the typically intellectually vacant fare on network TV!"
5,wii system,The Wii system is fabulous...it is helping me to lose weight the correct way..thanks for the fast service in shipping it me...we love the wii fit and wii sports thanks
4,Great fun for a couple,"The basic Wii sports games are fun for the beginner and especially for a couple who likes a little competition. It's an excuse to do something active rather then sitting in front of the TV like a pair of drones. Although there many helpful tips on the internet about the games, it would have been helpful to list the basic functions of the remote controller affecting each game. For instance, I still havent figured out how an inside slider configured on the controller becomes a fast ball right down the middle of the plate for a home run."
3,Fun for children! Graphics beyond lacking,"If you have a PS3 and a plasma over 32"" and appreciate HD you will be sickened by the Wii. The graphics are tragically horrid. The lack of response in the controllers compared to other gaming system is also not an appreciated attribute. That said, if you are considering this for your 5 year old or you really like to be active this is the system for you! The games that involve activity just don't exist outside the Wii in the same manner so for that fact alone it's worth the purchase if you want to move around. If you seek aesthetics and rapid response stick with XBox 360 or Playstation 3."
5,pseudo exercise discovery,Looked for a long time for anything that would get my husband on his feet and moving that was not called exercise. He has PPS and even walking is painful. He can stand as long as he can then sit in a chair and play all of the games in the Wii sports package and be moving more than he has in some time and have fun doing it.
2,Lack of great games!,"I know no one will read this, since most people are reading 5/5 stars or 1/5, but i do want to say this anyhow. I feel that the ONLY reason this system is rated so high is because of its revolutionary point and shoot joystick. Its so different from every other console. This is more of a fitness than an action console . That being said, there are almost absolutely no games for 18-30 age group. Most are for either really young kids OR fitness for people who are too lazy to go and join a gym. The only thing thats giving this console some punch power is the Mario franchise. But seriously. Your 2nd top rated game of all time for wii is Kirby Yarn. This game looks like it was made for 5 year olds. I had 100 bucks to spend on wii games this holiday and after spending 30 min I couldnt find anything worth buying. That would have never happened for PS3."
5,"The internet, ATM and Wii","I take my time before buying things and for a couple of years I had been joking about buying an XBox. When the time to buy came, I researched and decided on a Wii. It exceeded anything I could have expected. The two points which sold me are 1) you have to get up off the couch and get active to play and 2) the focus isn't so much on violence, blood and killing. I'm a senior citizen and my daughter picked this up for me. We played it until our arms were numb and she is looking to get her own Wii so we can play on-line. I check the daily weather and news stories on my Wii and my friends and I will soon start a bowling league. For the price, you can't beat this system. If I were paying 50 cents for every game I played, it would have paid for itself in a month or two. The software selection is great and the prices are reasonable. I rate the Wii right up there with the Internet and the ATM. Get yours and you'll see."
4,Wii Review,"The Wii console was delivered on time. It worked well and is excellent fun. It was hard to hook up to our existing TV system and there were no specific instructions for the TV brand by Wii, or for from the manufacturer for a Wii hookup. I achieved a successful hook up based on Wii instructions however. The system worked as advertised and is excellent fun."
2,"Fine for kids, or adults playing w/ kids, gamers need not apply.","Unless you don't expect much from a system, then the wii is perfect. It has a few novelties that grow dull real quick (Mii's, motion sensor thats wacky as hell, virtual console,...). The sad thing is the best part about the system is the old games on virtual console, which you have to pay $5-$10 for, are you kidding? We've had one for 8 months, has been turned on for maybe 15-20 hrs total. The best game they have is the sports, unless your a fanboy of Zelda or Mario (which are childish and mediocre) and that's all that needs to be said. If you even think about spending more then the base $250 for this system your out of your gourd, if you have a wide screen your going to feel cheated by the standard 4:3 ratio of the system (looks horrible on 16:9). PS3 or Xbox360 is a better investment then this thing, game selection and shelf life will exceed the wii by yrs. That's my 2cents."
3,What The Heck!!!,I want one of these but the price is so HIGH!!! I mean who wants to buy a Wii at that Insane price!!! They could probably make more money selling more less priced Wii's then selling overpriced ones. This just makes me mad!!
5,Weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee with Wii,I just love my Wii. My son had purchased a Wii when he was still living at home and he got me Wii Fit and Dancing with the Stars. When he moved out and took the Wii with him I had to get one of my own. I enjoy the Fit games and challenge myself to improve every day. It's great!
2,Wii is pretty lame,"Bad graphics, last-gen technology and a gimmicky controller. Add to that non-existant third party support and you have a pretty weak console. I have played about 5 games on the Wii at length, including Zelda and Wii Sports and I have to say this console is pretty lame. The controller is unresponsive, and the graphics are poor."
5,Nintendo Wii,Bought item for Christmas gift; Amazon was the only place I found it in stock so I am thrilled!
4,WII System,"The system arrived as promtely as promised. My 6 yr old son really enjoys the sports game included with the system. The game does not seem to getting boring to him. I love the fact that the system required him to be more physically involved when compared to traditional video game consoles. The only real dissapointment is the fact that so many extra accessories are required for My son, wife and I to enjoy all of the features of the console. It is quite obvious what Nintendo's marketing strategy is.......... so be prepared to spend another $120 on accessories."
5,The Wii is Mii,"The Wii is awesome. I ordered it from Game Direct and it came really fast. It came in 1 day when I got the basic shipping!!! It has all wraped up and works perfectly!!!! The Wii is a great Game System. It's really light and goes with any decor. It is a great experience to try the Wii. I recommend for all the nintendo game system users to buy the Wii NOW!!!! It is extraordinary. It even comes with a free game Wii Sports. It is a gamers dream to have this real life interaction with a video game. Maybe in the future there will be a virtual game system, but until them we still have the Wii which is close enough!"
2,A magic nintendo box,"The Wii is like a fun little nintendo Box. you can play all sorts of old nintendo games on it that were a blast, and download new conceptual things on wiiware.as a current gaming console...there's nothing good to play. zelda and mario galaxy were pretty fun but they lack the depth of comparable titles on the other two systems. This generation of gaming consoles is pretty tricky, but the wii is the most shallow and stripped down of them all. Once the magic of Wii Sports wears off, its pretty much over because there isn't anything you can really immerse yourself in. And its no cheaper than an Xbox (and somewhat compared to ps3) because if you buy controllers to play its smorgasborg of quick multiplayer games you're set back another $[...]."
5,The most revolutionary game system in years,"The Wii is so much more fun than I thought it would be. And I thought it would be fun. My neice got one for Christmas and the whole family loved it. Even my 74 year old dad played and enjoyed it. I'm getting married this spring and my fiancee and I will be getting one of these. You actually get some excercise playing this game! The system even comes with games! It's been a long time since that happened for a launch. There's baseball, boxing, bowling, tennis, and golf! All with the system! Super!"
4,A Good Family game system,"Kids & wife like this (Generally, I don't game.) Graphics definitely are sufficient for the types of games & activities BUT not realistic/movie level. Personally I like it this way as realism seems to devolve into fight/shoot/kill ""games"".Used both for gaming and exercise. However, as it is controller required (Unlike XBOX Kinnect) you can fool the machine by using only hand movements. Still can provide a lot of fun & a workout, especially with the Wii balance board!Do not use it much for internet beside a little youtube."
3,READ THIS,"Buy the wii if you have kids or like inviting people or throwing parties in your place so everyone can have fun while spending less in a gaming console. Otherwise, if you wanna have motion-sensored fun buy the kinect and if you want a real videogame console buy the xbox360 or the ps3 and do not let nintendo steal the beloved licensed franchises as Zelda, Metroid and Mario by making a 'console' that doesn't even support high definition. Come on nintendo get serious! by making your market bigger, we, the real gamers, owners of nes, snes, n64 and gc are the ones paying the price dont be sooo cheap"
2,Wii ups and downs,"The wii is a fun family system for having fun. I'm the profiler's son so I am a hard core gamer the wii isn't much for me. The wii has lots of great party games but they aren't realistic enough. I have a an easy time playing the wii so it gets boring. I would choose the wii for young families that has not had a lot of time together. Now like I sWii Play with Wii Remoteaid I am a hardcore gamer. I would pick a Xbox 360, or a PS3. The wii has a lot of fun games that come out from time to timebut the wii isn't good enough to reach hardcore gaming. The wii is a fun choice, but if your family is a hardcore gamer family I would choose an Xbox 360, or a PS3."
4,Everything works out of the box,"Well, I don't own this product, I buy it for a friend and I tested it for him. I'm not a nintendo fan, but I really like this console, everything is brand new, works well, a it has a lot of fun.If you have children or you want a simple a nice game system, buy it!"
4,Down syndrome child Wii Bowling in 6 minutes!,The Wii Sports program that came with this device was fairly intuitive for our 26 year old. This Down Syndrome child was Wii Bowling in 6 minutes! We plan on training her on as many other of the Wii Sports included as she moves along. Good job Nintendo!
3,Buy only if you want to keep up with the Jones',I bought a Wii last year and I have have played it about maybe only about 100-130 hours. It's an ok system if you don't play games that often. That is due to the fact of not a large selection of good games. Most of the games are aimed for kids not yet in the 4th grade. I'm not saying thats bad but if your looking for more mature games I would go with a PS3 or an Xbox 360. The wii does not support HDTV which makes it look like crap on a HDTV. I think that Nintendo need to some rethinking. I know that wii is out selling xbox and ps3 but how long can they do that with the lack of good games.
5,"Thanks, Amazon!!","This year was no different than the ones before in trying to find a Wii in any store in Tyler, Texas a couple of weeks before Christmas. Thanks to Amazon, I was able to order it and have it shipped in plenty of time for Christmas. The product was brand new and my daughter was so excited to finally get her Wii. Totally satisfied customer."
3,"of note,","* compact console roughly the size of a 5.25"" pc drive.* new controller design takes some getting used to.* wired internet requires extra hardware.* will not play audio cd or dvd.overall: a good system for its size, but i think they sacrificed a little too much."
1,HUGE flaws!!!1,"To start, like everyone else says, the graphics are horrible, now usually i don't care about the graphics if the game is good,(i mean if the graphics are good as well i won't complain) but really? REALLY? another thing, Im a pretty big zelda fan, (and metroid and mario party on occasion) and i wanna play a game not a workout,(which technically isn't even a work out...) i mean i can't play the legend of zelda if i need to use these weird ass motion controllers, I'm am completely disapointed by the wii. My main concern is not being able to play zelda efficiently. i wanna play it and continue the story, not swing my arms around like an idiot."
1,WII,"I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY DAUGHTER FOR CHRISTMAS AND IT DOSE NOT WORK,HAS NOT SINCE SHE GOT IT,MY DAUGHTER HAS NOT BEEN HAPPY AT ALL.BUT GUESS YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR,HUH"
1,WII,This item was used. It it useable is useable but in black and white instead of color. I'm using it with a brand new TV so it has to be the WII that is not working properly. All the games I use on it are also new & have been played on a my other new new Wii system. On the new system they work fine & are in color. It will work for a 2nd game box but I'm not happy with it being in black and white instead of color. I was told the reason for the problem was it had probably got too hot at one time. Hopefully the seller didn't realize this when they sold it to me. I don't think it was really a bargain since it doesn't work properly.
4,A family console,With 11 and 13 year old boys with an xbox 360 you could ask why a Wii. But we set up in the family room and it gets well used by the whole family rather than the boys going off to do their own thing. Good also for entertaining the neighborhood kids - parents have not yet played each other but who knows.......
3,WII is only 250 dollars,"I am currently working overseas and here at the store is 250 dollars Tax free, and it hurts me to see that people are writting ""Un-expensive console"" when they getting charge 400, 500, 600 and even 700 dollars for this Nintendo that is good, but not high definition or anything like that.Next generation consoles are Playstation 3 and Xbox 360 (in which PlayStation 3 60GB is better)So please stop buying this console in such expensive prices and you will see that they will drop it to the original price ""250 dollars"" or if you have somebody that is overseas, and I am pretty sure you do, tell them to send you one, it cost only 40 dollars to send it with insurance and everything. I'll do it for 20 bucks, jajaja.Thank you for reading this and take care."
3,To bad you can't find one to buy,After a year there are not enough to buy. People buying up the basic package and turning around and selling it for twice the cost should be ashamed. I won't pay someone that will cheat a kid at Christmas.
5,gouge,"Well, I pretty much think the wii is the best system EVER!the ps3 is junk.although, its pretty much junk how everyone, INCLUDING YOU PEOPLE SELLING ON AMAZON! are trying to rip off people by selling a $250 item at $500 or more! what the hobo!"
5,Nintendo Wii Console,"The Nintendo Wii is really an amazing system. I bought this for my daughters 12 and 9. I love the fact that you don't sit on the couch and push buttons. There is plenty of activity involved while playing the games. It doesn't matter how old you are, you can have tons of fun with this system. The built in wireless works flawlessly. Wii Fit will be our next big purchase! I can't wait to see what they come up with next!"
5,Wii is the greatest!,"Not only did I get this product quickly with PRIME, but it was everything I'd hope it would be AND MORE!"
4,Fun System,Got this for my daughter for Christmas. It's lots of fun. Not hard to set up. The only problem we had was a bad controller that had to be exchanged. That was a bit of a disappointment. You expect things out of the box to work.
3,For kids 8 down if not get a 360.,This console is for you if you have kids but if your an adult and get this console then get a life and a 360.or just rent the wii and rent resident evil 4 that in my opinion is the best game on the wii.O and did I mention that 70% of the games are crap.And 97% of the third party games are crap too.
2,Fun at first but lacking in quality game selection,"I was really excited to buy this console when I saw how real movements would be used to play games. I had a lot of fun playing the Wii Sports game included. However, I eventually got tired of it and found very few games worth playing, especially compared to Xbox and PS. Next time, I will wait to see if developers are creating enough compelling games before buying a console."
2,"A great game, why can't they make a reliable nunchuck?","Our kids love playing the wii. When they are able. The Wii nunchuck makes me regret ever buying a wii system for my children. We've gone through about 10 of them in two years. They work for a few months, then you need to buy a new one. So basically we can keep buying nunchucks or we'll just have all of these expensive games our children can't play. Great choice. Don't buy Wii."
4,Great gaming machine for all ages!,"I never played any games or used any of the gaming systems (nintendo ds, xbox, ps2 etc..). The last game I played was doom ( a couple of times when it was released and then got bored of that).Nintendo Wii has converted such a person to a game addict (almost - not quite yet!). The included sports game disk is good (I do have some issues - there is room for improvement in tennis in placement of the ball, you cannot move the player etc).I also tried Mario and Sonic at the olympics another great game for Wii.In all it is a great entertainment for the whole family.I wish Nintendo makes it less scarce in the US."
4,Great console for the whole family.,"For now, the Nintendo Wii is one of a kind. There isn't a console out there right now that can match this one in terms of player interaction. Sure the selection of games and graphics are two let downs, but let's face it, it's fun as heck to play some of these games. People of all ages from young to old can have fun racing with Mario cart, playing golf, boxing, or tennis. It also seems every month Nintendo comes out with a game that utilizes the Wii's unique interface to create a never before thought you could do that game.When it comes to decide whether to choose a Ps3 or a 360, I would also say to include the Wii too.9/10"
5,Excellent Product! No complaints,"Everything you mentioned was all in the box, it came with everything that was needed. Everything works great! It was here at my house in just a few days and i was impressed. Seems like a pretty honest seller to me, keep it up!"
3,Overhyped and Not worth it,"Quite honestly my wii is now gathering dust on my shelf right now due to its horrible game options and graphics. The sensor doesnt pick up half my movements and the remote is shaped in such a way that it is uncomfortable to hold. I first bought it thinking it was a revolution, but its so basic that the technology isnt even worth it. Buy an Xbox or Ps3 if your a family gamer and just buy some games from their online stores which have a lot to offer. If you a gamer you should know that this is a skull and crossbones for you. Trust me within a month you'll be fed up with this...."
2,It died after about a year,It worked ok for about a year but now locks up constantly. Of course this happened right after it went out of warranty.
4,Wii for my Kids,I am very impressed in the condition and it was brand new as described. My kids love it more than I do and that's all that matters. Good price as well. Recommended to other buyers.
4,Recent Wii purchase,"The wii arrived quickly, my family loved it. The only ""problem"" with the wii was that one of the remotes had initials written on it. Overall no issues, works well."
5,Fun and a half,"My children & grandchildren have had a Wii for several years. Finally decided to get one for my home. Wii is fun for whole family, especially when nothing on TV or no ""good"" movies on. ( Kids are better at this than I am). Lots of activities (games) that contain no ""shoot-em-up"" stuff, unless you want that. Got a great deal, brings family members together, what more can you ask for?"
4,It's cool I guess,"The Wii is basically a Gamecube in a smaller white package with motion control. Some new features besides motion control have been added though, and now you can: view photos off SD cards, create weird little people that kind of look like you called Miis, and (given you have a wi-fi connection or adapter) download Nintendo's entire back catalog of games, vote on stuff, view the weather, read the news, and surf the internet with it (including youtube, myspace, and flash game sites).On the games side, the Wii is pretty boring if you don't have any friends or family to play with, mainly because there are just two good single-player games that have come out: Zelda and Super Paper Mario. Soon that will change though as Metroid Prime 3: Corruption, Super Mario Galaxy, Resident Evil: Umbrella Chronicles, Super Smash Bros. Brawl, and Soul Calibur Legends arrive on store shelves. Overall it's a good system but one that only excels above the others in price and controller innovation."
5,Keep In Shape With Wii,"With the recent price drop, free shipping and Amazon's $25.00 gift certificate, this is one great deal. The interaction using the Wii remote is awesome and much fun. I used the $25 Amazon gift certificate to purchase the new Wii Resorts which comes with the new add-on for the Wii remote for more accurate interaction movements for the Resort games. My guess is that new games for the Wii will have the ability to use the remote add-on to it's full advantage. While the graphics are not true HD, you can purchase a component cable for the Wii console which will give you a screen resolution of 420p. Other games, such as Blazing Angels, play well and graphically are excellent with the component cable. All in all, this is a purchase well worth the price."
5,Awesome,"Wii is awesome. I love the interactive aspect. The sports games are great, allowing you to actually take swings with the Wii controller to play the games. This is leap years above the competition."
4,Interesting and useful,"If you are a manager in something related with production, or just interested in Mass Customization, this book is for you. It brings a new aproach to the usual concepts, and may change your point of view about supply chain management or product design.I really consider it's worth the trouble reading it"
1,Lots of opinion - but little substance,"The transition towards Build-to-order is a challenge thay many industries face today. Offering customized products in increasingly demanding and dynamic markets renders current forecast-driven strategies more and more ineffective. The current incentive crisis in the auto industry marks a case in point.Unfortunately this book falls short of capturing the complexity of this transition, which is not helped by the general lack of emprical evidence. I would have expected a comprehensive discussion of the organisational changes needed to make the transition, but instead the book seems to feature the author's personal opinion based on a few limited cases only. Overall a rather disappointing title."
1,OVERRATED,"Book has some history of the school .I was looking for genealogy info as i had 3 generations of women in my family attend Bloomfield.As the title suggests i was looking for my grandmothers story. Very few personal stories of Bloomfield & the students..more so a history of the Nation , not Bloomfield Academy's students."
3,Architecture versus a poor rural village = a win-win situation,"The author/architect, as another reviewer aptly put it has his heart in the right place. This reader found the book interesting, but after the first few projects the pictures really say it all. The residences were interesting, from a material and design point of view. I believe the design of the meeting places were all too small to be effective. I thought it was a unique, rewarding book, in an area I had never considered before, and I thought it was a win-win situation, young architects get to experiment with designs and some rural poor struggling homeowner obtains an upgraded house. Perhaps anopther ""only in America situation"" can it be said that a rural struggling southern village should sport some avant gard architecture. Interesting use of packed earth throughtout the book, but limited in scope"
1,shadow knows,Heart seems to be in the right place...definately unsophisticated idealistic student work...Replacing traditional shacks with funky new age scrap shacks...Traditional/functional vernacular type buildings might have been a better long term choice and value for those concerned...
1,Anything Can Get Published,"Sadly, I so gotta agree with Mystik and the reviewer #2...... I finished reading it out of pure stubborness. The only good thing I could really say about it is -- well, for aspiring writers this should be great encouragement! Apparently, even the most poorly written drivel can get published!!! (I would have called in sophomoric drivel, but that would have been undeserved flattery!)"
4,What a find!,"Always on the lookout for classic British Psych, I stumbled across House of Many Windows: Psychedelic Pstones 3. What a find! Most songs are very good to excellent. Some sound like a trans-Atlantic, cross-pollination of the 1960's San Francisco scene and the London scene.This collection also avoids repeating the same tracks found on other collections. Thankfully, no track from this set is on any of these collections: Nuggets II, Rubble Collection 1-10, Mojo Acid Drops, Great British Psychedelic Trip, Circus Days 1-6, Psychedelic-Freakbeat Scene.If you're a British Psych fan, you've got to get this![DW]"
4,I love this cd !,"Everything by the first reviewer was absolutely right on!Delightful tunes you won't hear on any other albums.Darn,60's music was just sooo good.Glad I was there !"
1,"Give Up, Flip","Does Flip think he can sell this junk to real Keys anglers? The good old days are gone, and most of the big names Flip shares are old as well. Whey not a book by Flip comparing the past with the present."
3,Just not for me.,I'm sure this is a very good tape but I have had two back surgeries and it was not somethingI could do without pain. Probably great for most people. I am 75.
1,Not Durable At All,"I've worn boots for years now. One reason is that they are rugged and hold up well. These boots fell apart. The top leather is thin, which isn't a problem until the stitching rips right through it. The last straw was when the buckle fell off for the strap. Look somewhere else for a good boot."
5,Perfect... if you have the right foot for them,"I switched to this shoe about 8 months ago. I have nothing but good things to say....Naturally, the wearer must investigate to determine what kind of shoe he or she will need before purchase. This shoe is designed for a normal arch and ""normal"" pronation. In addition to this, it is designed for heavier runners (more than 180 lbs.). If the wearer does not fit this, the shoe will not meet your needs.The shoe itself has a large toe box, is very light (considering the midsole's cushioning), and long-lasting. It is cool in the summer months, and will require a warmer sock in winter months.For me this was a perfect shoe, and I will not make a change until the Trance model is totally discontinued--it's that good.**I advise buying 1/2 a size up, as the fit is slightly tighter than the conventional sizing usually employed."
2,Good to watch once,"It is informative, however it is something that you watch once get a kick out of a few things, and that's it. I would have liked to see more about the beginnings of their careers and not about their barbers, eating disorders, and haloween costumes. I should have rented this and not bought it."
4,Nice background info and some 'dorky' looking school photos,"All the individual stories were interesting, but some more so than others. Certain segments also seemed a bit short and less in-depth compared to others.The music used made the whole thing feel a bit 'whimsical', like a 50's TV show. In the 'extras' section, I enjoyed seeing the rare footage of RVD kissing Million Dollar Man's foot for a couple Benjamin's.It was also enjoyable listening to Al Snow explain how he broke into the business. The old-time trainers had a very sadistic streak and the stories are always cringe-worthy to hear."
4,Not for the novuce,"This is a well put together DVD and I would have given it 5 stars but the sound quality isn't that great. I will point out straight away though, that this DVD is NOT for a beginner. You need to be working at an advanced intermediate stage, (beyond grade 5) to be able to follow Eliot Fisk's descriptions of chord structures, rythmm and harmonies, and to be able to take his instructional content and apply it to the instrument. The pieces which he performs on the DVD, are well within reach, if you study them carefully, and don't try to play them at the speed Eliot does, you will find it useful."
5,The best advice on vibrato you'll ever find,"A quote straight from the DVD:""Just wiggle it until it feels right""Who could argue with that? :)"
5,Everything you need,I bought this gear for my 13 year old son so he could keep it for a few years.... I would say 15 years is right on the money as far as size but we made it work for him. I dont know why anyone would pay more and buy anything else. This gear is great... well made.. and nice looking.
5,I can relate!,"This should be required reading for every education major. I teach in an urban school; Ms. Johnson had something some of my young colleagues who quit teaching after a year do not have--resolve, persistance, and determination. There are no ""bad"" kids, there are kids who do ""bad"" things or come from ""bad"" environments, but as Ms. Johnson writes, it is possible to save the kids by giving a lot of ourselves."
3,elegantdesign.co.nz Book Review,The book was very logical yet had many creative aspects. I would recommend it for a mid-range painter.
3,Are You Insane?,"Dude, NO ONE is going to buy this, or any other Gundam MSiA Figure, for $99.00! I don't know if you are new at this or just stupid, but there is no freaking way anyone is going to pay $99 for a Gabthley figure! You'd be lucky if you could sell it for $25 at a convention! Same thing goes for your Hizack figure.This isn't really a review, so much as advice. If you want to move this product, LOWER THE PRICE!Thank you for your time, and have a good day."
5,Goose bumps rock,I love the goose bump ball. I really like to tool my tired feet on the ball in the evening while I watch TV. It then will often move to my upper back to roll away the stress.
5,Goose Bumps,"I love these! I use them almost daily to get rid of tension knots. The Goose Bump is between my back and a wall, and I roll away. You have to becareful on your walls though. I press so hard I have worn a whole in my plaster. My muscles feel great though. Massage is as deep as my massage therapist. Couldn't live without these."
5,Best kept secret,I've had a set of these for years. I keep one in my car at all times. Ever get a kink in your neck that hurts so bad you can't turn you head to see if someone is in the other lane? Just put one of these between your shoulder blade and the cars seat. The little goosebumps will release the tension enough so that you can actually move your head. It's like magic.Lower back pain? Lay on it in bed or put behind your back while sitting at the computer.If you enjoy deep tissue massage and find that most people can't apply enough pressure to the knots in your back then you will be in for a real treat with these.The only downfall is trying to get the top of the shoulders. There is no easy way to position your body so that the very top of your shoulders will press into the balls without contorting yourself which defeats the purpose of trying to relax the back muscles.Also the spikes can hurt against the bare skin. I recommend wearing a shirt or wrapping a t-shirt around the ball.
4,Relatively Hard Massage balls,I also thought these massage balls would be softer and need to use socks when I use them. They do help improve the circulation when I roll over them with my foot.
4,Wonderful book there!,"This book kept me ""spell-binded"" to it. One of the best works by Paul so far, i'm aure. This is a book worth reading as it is one of the most enchanting in this sabrina series.Sabrina never seems to lose its touch, with its wonderful spells and plot. Once again, three cheers for Sabrina!!"
4,"A really good Sabrina book, but not the best","I have read tons of Sabrina books, and I really love this one. Some parts were extremely good, but some parts were just really strange. I thought the scene where Sabrina and Salem are trying to get through the chutes and ladders was kind of boring. Although I really liked how the book had tons of characters from the beginning of the show."
4,The box was loaded with healthy worms,I love my worms. I actually miss them when I go out of town. The box came on time and with tons of wriggling worms. I would suggest buying them closer to the weekend because they are only shipped on Mondays to prevent a day or two sitting at the post office. I ordered them on a Monday night and had to wait for two weeks to receive them.
5,Great Find!,Received these worms in a timely manner nice and healthy.I am using them right now with my junior high and high school special education science class.We are just starting to grow our own heirloom seeds to plant in the springtime in our garden.This is loads of fun for both the students and the teachers.
5,Worms,"I was not sure ordering worms for the first time, I was not sure quite what to expect being that I live in an area that 2""deep is solid cap rock. We created raised beds for vegetables, bringing in 12 inches of dirt. They arrived in a timely manner, 4 days. Large bag for price, even with the filler more worms than I could count. Upon opening the bag all worms were still moist and moving around, after I placed them in the dirt, immediately they all began to disappear. Directions included were followed besides worms being divided into 4 raised vegetable garden beds instead of keeping in one large colony. Overall great service and worms seem to be acting like worms. I included some photos to give a better visual of what to expect being that there is a limited amount of information on this product. My photos represent a 1.lb bag."
4,composting worms,"Fast shipping--Received the worms in 2 days. Worms were alive, healthy, and moving. I started a worm composting bin with my 3 y/o daughter and she loved touching and learning about the worms. A great project for kids. I would have given 5 stars but I seriously doubt I received 1000 worms, maybe 200 at most."
1,"Too slow, too few, too dead","There are a trio of things that make this purchase worthy of a one start review. To break it down -Too Slow:Ordered 4-27-2011 with 2-day shipping. They arrived 5-05-2011. No matter how you break that down, unless you say ""Days that end in 'y' don't count,"" that's not 2-day shipping.Too Few:You're supposedly buying 1,000 worms. In reality, as others mention, there are roughly 300.Too Dead:And of the 300, most are dead.Stay away from this purchase; waste of money."
1,Not sure how many survived the slow delivery!,Not happy at all I feel like I got cheated delivery came in 5 days not 2 not sure how many survived the heat. Not happy at all
3,"So, so experience...","Worms shipped and arrived well. They were much smaller than the large worms that had been discussed in the reviews. I emailed the seller after experiencing problems with the worms escaping and dying off, but did not receive a response. I ended up ordering a new pound of worms from thewormdude and had a much better experience with lots of help both before and after the purchase."
2,Third time's a charm,"I had a lot of problems with this seller. In short, I ordered, received notification that it shipped, was unable to track the package, and finally got it really late. Maybe 50 live worms and a lot of dirt.Amazon customer service placed a replacement order, for next day delivery. Days later, I actually received two replacement orders on the same day, although placed on different days.... Amazon customer service was great, but the fulfillment center was terrible. I could not track any of the packages and none of them were next day.First box: mostly deadSecond box: mostly dead, but appeared to be more alive than the firstThird box; plump, healthy looking worms throughout"
1,Worms arrived dead,Worms arrived late and dead on arrival. I would strongly suggest to either find a different vendor or buy worms locally.
1,failed order TWICE,"I tried ordering these worms twice, i never got my first order, called amazon to replace it so they did, and then i never recived my second order. Now i have to wait 3 days to get a refund"
5,very pleased!,"Well, it feels just a tad bit wierd to be rating worms. I mean, I didn't get up close and personal with the product, but they seem to be happy, healthy, very alive, frisky and doing their thing in my kitchen composter. I would however like to put in a good word for the customer service dept: Best I have EVER seen in any business. And I order several products of various kinds every week, have done so for years. Uncle Jim's is the best or was for me! I recommend this company for their service, and like I say, as far as I can tell, the worms are alive and well."
2,Not good,"I had to wait 3 weeks for them to finally ship it after I had assumed it was not coming.... When I got it most worms were dead, not even close to 1000 worms as well.... I recently got a half pound/500 worms from a local supplier and there were many more worms then this products ""1000"".I would not recommend buying worms here."
1,Dead!,They all died even with lots of food. I guess they couldn't figure out how to get to the next level in our worm bin. What a waste of money!2nd shipment of worms lasted maybe 3 days.Such a waste!
1,Worms tasted stale. Very disappointed.,These are the worst tasting worms I've ever eaten. I stir-fried a couple dozen with some onions and peppers and they tasted awful. Yuck.
5,Good worms!,"Well, what can you say about a box of worms? They arrived very quickly. We did have a charity pick up scheduled for that day and had to call the charity and ask for our box of worms back! The worms were - - well, red and wiggly so....that was as described. They are hard at work composting now and have not tried to escape or make unreasonable demands on us. Everyone should order worms from these guys!"
5,Great Worms,Excellent people to deal with. I would gladly do business with them again. Due to the heat some of the worms were deceased when they arrived. A new order was quickly shipped to me at no charge. Good price also
5,Awesome Experience!!!,"So I bought my worms expecting them to take a while to arrive at my door. But lo and behold, they actually showed up within a week. Scared the mail carrier, one had escaped and was working its way out of the box. When I moved my worms from the packaging to my soil, they appeared healthy and ready to go to work. I'm looking forward to seeing them thrive in my home compost. I would highly recommend this buyer to anyone looking for fast, convenient and reliable grower/shipper of red wigglers."
5,So many worms!,Pleased with the amount of worms that came-every one seemed alive and ready to work. Added them to both compost bins so we'll see how they do.
2,"It says 1,000 but if it was more than 500 I'd be shocked","It is a great product but the instructions say they will plump back up 2-3 days after shipping. They need the time to get re-hydrated. Well after a week they are still very small. I don't know if it was a fluke or not but they were small and unless your counting the eggs that can have up to 20 worms per egg. Even being small it would be hard to believe there was a 1,000 worms. Don't get me wrong the concept is incredible, I'm planning on doing a lot more with worms. I just don't feel I got $25.00 worth of worms. If I can find anyone who has red wigglers local I will try that next."
5,Good so far,"I ordered these worms to go with my Worm Factory. They sent me a separate e-mail from Amazon to let me know the shipping date and tracking. They usually ship on Mondays to avoid the worms getting stuck at the post office over the weekend.They arrived in peat moss in a fabric bag within the cardbox shipping box. It came with good directions... give them a drink immediately upon receipt!I've had my worms for about 3 weeks now and they are thriving, already there are new baby worms! Looking forward to my rich compost!"
1,dead worms,"I recieved my worms on time, in proper packaging, but all the worms were dead. All of them. I would have been okay if I had ten worms... but all of them were dead. I wasted 35 dollars. :("
1,Got Dirt - no worms,"I'm waiting on my replacement package, but the first shipment was a box of dirt. No worms. Nada. Not even dead worms. Do you think whomever packed the box might have noticed? This does not bode well.Received the replacement package yesterday and it did have worms. They were all dead. And there certainly weren't 1000. Since the package was shipped overnight I think these worms must have been sitting somewhere for a long time, then sent along since there wasn't a living one among them. Extremely disappointing.Amazon did great - the seller not so much."
1,All worms were dead,The worms arrived smelling really bad and when I opened up the small cardboard box I found a cloth sack tied at the top a really stinky smell was comming from the box when I opened it up I found the worms all dead. It looked nothing like what was shown on amazon. Don't waste your money.
1,"Poor packaging, poor shipping, and poor delivery by UPS.","Due to several packaging and shipping mistakes associated with this product the worms arrived DOA. I placed my order on June 12 and the worms shipped out on June 15, due to arrive on June 16. Instead, thanks to a delay by UPS, the worms did not arrive until June 17. In addition, as I noticed on the tracking information, the worms went out for delivery at 7:30 am and did not arrive until 6:30 pm, riding around on an un-airconditioned UPS truck all day in 107 degree heat - genius. The worms arrived dead, huddled together in a ghastly-smelling cloth bag. There was no insulation to protect them against extreme temperatures. The poor worms were cooked to death. Since I still needed red worms for vermicomposting, I ordered some from Twin Buttes Worm Farm in San Angelo, Texas, and they arrived in great shape."
3,Definitely not 1000,"The first batch I got was mostly dead worms (I think the cold got to them) so I contacted the seller. They did send another batch promptly, but it was nowhere near 1,000. I didn't count the first batch but I only counted 250 in the second batch I received."
2,Disappointed,"I knew better than to order worms from such a distance (PA to CA), but got a discount through Amazon with this seller, so I went ahead with it. What a disappointment! The worms were sluggish (to be expected after traveling so long) and arrived way ahead of the worm bin I ordered (again, poor judgment on my part). What disappointed me the most though, was that the price was per pound of WORMS. What landed in my mail box weighed 11.4 ounces, and that included the medium the worms were transported in, the bag they were placed in, and the box. Sheesh! Will definitely be buying closer to home and would suggest not only buying worms closer to home but to also make sure you have your worm box before purchasing the worms."
2,no where near 1000 worms,"The worms were tiny, arrived half dead, and there was no way 1000 in there. More like 200 or 300 at most. I then ordered 1 pound of worms from ebay for less money (including 10 pounds of castings). The ebay worms traveled farther through the mail yet arrived lively, much larger, and with about 4 times as many in the box. I most certainly will NOT be ordering from uncle jim's again."
2,Must be careful about Distance from East Coast when Ordering,"The simple issue is that UPS is not that reliable for cross-country shipments on consistent scheduling.I'm sure the worms were fine when they started. But after 9 days in-transit, on top of summer heat, there's nothing left when they arrive. Shipping from PA.I'm sure the 4 and 5 star reviews are mostly East coast customers (FL, NY, SC/NC, etc.)Most of the 1/2 star reviews are West coast customers (CA, NV, WA, AZ, NM).As stated in the packaging, it's tricky shipping live animals, but once the 3-day shipping goes to a full-week, the result is unfortunately dead worms.I'd recommend only over-night/Next Day shipping (Red-label UPS, or FedEx Next Day) to states past the Mississippi. Or figuring out a west-coast supplier that can drop ship from this end of the country."
4,Gma Pat,"The little red wrigglers arrived in a timely manner and, although small, as they said they would be they seemed to be in good condition. I had purchased a composting bin before ordering the red wrigglers and since this is our first try at composting it's too soon to tell if we are successful at composting, however, the wrigglers appear to be doing fine."
5,You can't go wrong,"I wanted to feed and fertilize my lawn and flowers naturally this year. I opted to introduce worms into my flower garden. Have not had my red wrigglers that long; however, I am beginning to see small changes in my flower garden. I highly recommend Uncle Jim's composting worms for your lawn and garden."
5,good worms,"Nice lively worms that were delivered on time , early actually. Packed in a cloth bag with compost .I put half in a compost pile and half in a tub with organic waste . Satisfied customer"
1,BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!!!,"FIRST THE PACKAGE NEVER ARRIVED, THEN AFTER CONTACTING AMAZON THEY SEND IT BUT THERE WHERE MAYBE 100 WORMS IN THERE. VERY SMALL AND WEEK ONES THAT DIED RIGHT AFTER I PUT THEM INTO MY CAREFULLY PREPARED WORM COMPOSTER."
3,Where did they go????,Ordered the red wigglers to go in my compost bin. Thought I would put some in now and add more later. Put a few in when they came. Put the rest in a container of peat moss. Fed them every couple of days. Went down today expecting to find lots of worms in the container. Sifted through most of the moss and only found a few worms in the container. It is a sealed tub with an air hole cut with fine mesh wire over the hole. Should have had hundreds of worms in the container. Many of the worms were tiny when they came but I thought they would grow...not get lost in their new home. Really expected to get larger worms to start with...not micro worms.
5,Lively and ready to make compost,The red wigglers arrived on time and were exactly as advertised. You can't beat the price and the quality. I will most definitely do business with good old Uncle Jim again.
3,Alive and well,These worms arrived alive and well a month or so ago during warmer weather in Boston. The packaging worked and kept them safe.The only thing that would prevent me from ordering again is that the worms get shipped whenever convenient for the company. So the one or two days to process before shipping is an understatement. It took at least a week before shipping for my order.
2,Worms arrived dead both times I received them,"I ordered the worms in the dead of winter and they arrived dead the first time I got them as well as the replacement worms they sent me. I know it is probably challenging to ship worms in the winter, but then don't sell them if you can't do it."
1,arrived dead,"I order a lb. of works, they all showed up dead in a bag.... there also did not seem to be 1000 in there as advertised. $30 down the drain."
1,Dead Worms,"The shipment took over a week to arrive and all 1000 of the worms were dead. It was a stinking, putrid mess that you could smell through the double boxes. The poor worms were shipped in a heavy plastic bag with absolutely no ventilation at all. They never had a chance. They also put the packing slip in the plastic bag with the worms. There was no way I was reaching in for that. My recommendation is to perhaps buy directly from Uncle Jim's Worm Farm. I'm sure they will do a better job at proper packing and shipping. As for me, I'm going to go back to Petland Discount to but the red wigglers. They sell in small quantities, but at least I can see what I'm getting. My small composting bin will not suffer from this experience. It will just take a little longer for stuff in the bin to break down. Good Luck to all. :)"
1,Buy worms locally... this was a HUGE mistake,"So I ordered this box of forms and recieved the most foul smelling back of compost dirt EVER! It was disgusting, stunk up the house in seconds and had to scrub my hands 3 or 4 times to get the smell off them.Oh an ZERO worms were in the package. I'm guessing that they died in the box and decomposed into dirt??? I dunno...would kind of explain the road kill smell.Sent it back for a full refund and found a local worm dealer."
1,Biggest Rip-Off!!!,"This item is awful. Received a package containing at most 50 worms...no where close to 1000. Don't think 1 was even alive. Poor, poor quality. Item grossly mis-represented. Would encourage Amazon to stop selling product."
1,DON'T BUY FROM THESE CON ARTISTS,I ordered 1000 red wigglers. It took a long time to recieve these pathetic worms. When they finaly arrived I was extremely dissapointed. There couldn't have been 100 worms in this supposed 1000 worm package.BUYER BEWARE! Uncle Jims worm shop should not be allowed to sell worms on Amazon! BOOOO! I don't like getting ripped off!I will upgrade my review if/when Uncle Jims sends me an honest 1000 worms.
2,Disappointed,"The package arrived on time, but there is no way the container had 1000 worms in it. I didn't count it, but I know there wasn't that many worms. I was a little disappointed."
5,Worms...get your worms here...,"After reading some of the reviews about delays in shipping, low count, and DOAs, I was nervous. Ridiculous! I received well over a thousand worms, did not find a single dead one, and it was clearly stated that worms ship on Mondays to prevent having them sit on a shipping dock over a weekend (so not really a delay in shipping).If you are looking to start vermicomposting, Uncle Jim's is a good place to obtain your workers at a fair price..."
5,Worms still going strong five days after delivery,"So far, so good.Ordered directly from Jimmy's Worms. Ordered the Worm Factory 360 and 2,000 worms. I received prompt responses to my e-mails after I placed the order.The Factory arrived in 4 days.The worms, as promised, shipped on the next Monday arrived via USPS 3 days later. They seemed healthy and settled into the prepared bedding well. I did not go to the trouble of counting them since they were clinging together in large masses. I assume that the order was complete as I'm now concerned that there are too many for the 360's tray.I am very glad I ordered the worms. I'm only having buyer's remose over the expense of the Worm Factory since in just 5 days with the worms I've learned they'd be quite happy in an old plastic bin with drill air holes."
1,None of the Worms survived!,"Granted I live in Texas and ordered these in the summer but they could have shipped these out sooner and not left them on a hot truck for 3 days. When they arrived, they barely moved and smelled like ammonia. I read the directions carefully to try and revive them but after a week, all I have is a pile of dirt and no worms since they all became compost. I'm going to go with a different company or look for something locally in the wintertime. These shipped out of Florida and you would think they would have given UPS instructions to keep the package in a cooler area like the front of the truck where there is a/c. And it was also probably sitting in a hot warehouse for several days too. Poor little guys didn't even have a chance!"
1,"Stinky package, no worm activity","7/27/11. This was sent as a gift. The worms arrived in a putrid package that was stinking up the hall of my apartment building. I didn't actually see any live worms in the mixture but the instructions say they are dehydrated after their journey and take a couple of days to readjust, so I followed the instructions for introducing them to my worm farm but after a week there is no sign of life - certainly not 1,000 worms.Update: 8/2/11. I contacted Amazon directly after noting all the recent reviews about dead worms arriving. Within 3 hours they had arranged for another shipment free of charge. The vendor waited until after a weekend and shipped a new batch of worms via overnight shipping. They arrived today healthy and in excellent condition. I think the lesson here is don't ship live critters 4-day UPS when the weather is ridiculously hot."
1,Took a long time to ship out and all the worms were dead,Not much to say that hasn't already been said. It took a week longer than expected to receive the worms and they arrived dead. The smell was horrendous. A replacement batch was sent and they arrived barely alive. I kind of wish I hadn't even put them in my bin with the other worms I have. I am hoping nothing bad arises from it. I would not ever purchase from them again.
1,Does not match description and took 2 weeks to arrive,"I ordered the 1000 count worms along with a Worm Factory 360 on a Monday (10/24) figuring that I would get it on Thursday or Friday so I can set it up before the weekend. Amazon sent out email with shipping tracking # indicating they are on the way. I received the Worm Factory on Friday but no sign of the worms. The kids were sorely disappointed. The worms didn't arrive till the following Thursday. When I opened the package, the worms didn't look very lively and it looked like there were maybe 100 worms in the bag... nowhere near the 1000 worms claimed by the description. I would have rated it zero stars if I could. Will not buy from them again."
5,Excellent,"2nd batch I've bought. They were a little dried out, but they were moving, and thats all that matters. Dumped them into the worm bin, and within 3 days of proper care, they were vigorous and healthy."
1,dead worms,"Worms arrived completely dead and maggots had taken their place, don't take the risk still can't figure out why there are so many favorable reviews."
5,Great Deal!,"I recieved my worms in three days .Healthy and packaged well.I bought two 10 gallon bins for 3.00 dollars each, drilled holes in tne bottom and sides.Drill the holes with the bins stacked together it saves time and energy.I lined the bin with a few inches of shredded newspaper and cardboard then filled the bin 2/3 full of coco peat moistend it down and added the worms.Im feeding them a few days later and they are doing very good .Thank You"
5,Great Little Worms,I am very happy with these little critters. I ordered them in early February and they arrive in the 3 to 5 day shipping time frame packaged in a canvas bag. They were delivered via USPS and left on my door step for a couple of hours in the cold and they perked right up when I brought them inside and gave them some water. I had their bin all set up and ready to go and they've been gnawing through my organic matter for a month now. I would recommend this product.
5,Fantastic,Compost worms from Uncle Jim's are fantastic. I will order some more this spring. No need to buy fertilizer any more. Fantastic product.
3,took forever to recieve!!!!!,NOT two day shipping. I was so bummed and then annoyed that it took well over a week to receive. They were a birthday gift that my boyfriend was really looking forward to. He was dying to start his worm factory on his days off. The worms were fine when they arrived.
1,Do NOT buy!,This item was horrible! My dad received it for part of his fathers day gift and all he got was DIRT! How Embarrassing!!! He called me and told me he had dirt! No live or dead worms! What a rip off DO NOT BUY!This item does NOT even deserve 1 star!
1,dissatisfied&dissapointed,"I was really dissapointed when my product arrived. Actually you could smell the delievery in the whole building(I had product shipped to my office). I was so embarrassed I grabbed the box and took it outside. I opened up the box and id di not see any worms moving and the smell made you want to throw up, my boss helped me spray water on the box in hopes that at least a few worms were alive but they weren't. My boss of course said that I should ask for a refund so I went on line and placed the request just to find out that requires you to send the smelly dead worms back. I could not see punishing our UPS driver like that. So I guess I've just lost $33.00. Never again."
5,Worms for the compost pile.,Second time I've ordered from these folks. Worms are well packaged. Worms arrive alive and healthy and go straight to the compost pile. Very satisfied. I order a package of worms every year and all of my future orders will be from these folks.
5,Red Wiggler Worms,"They arrived after a week because they deliver only on Mondays. The worms were plenty and alive in a nice bag full of soil, just give them a bit of water to revive those a bit ""tired"""
5,"Worms doing great, but not as long as I expected","Worms arrived as expected based on the description. Once I got them hydrated and fed they did great. They are not nearly as big as I expected. I think the longest one is maybe 3 inches long. I was looking for forward to also doing a little fishing with them and my little girls, but the short worms make that difficult."
4,Perspectives in the Nuclear Debate,"Is nuclear proliferation good? Does it increase stability? Or is it unstable, either because of accidents or misuse? Scott Sagan and Kenneth Waltz play out this debate in this book that looks at the nuclear question through organisational and realist perspectives. If you thought the answer to this debate was obvious, think again - this book will certainly leave you with a lot of questions."
2,More Stuff You Already Know,"I'm fairly sure the author just compiled a bunch of magazines she found in the doctor's office, and voila, she had a book! It's not compelling. It's not well-written. It's not new information. If you have horrible eating and exercise habits in the sense that you do nothing but eat double cheeseburgers in front of the TV and you've never considered any other way of life, this may be the book for you. These are probably things you already do anyway, like drink more water and eat more veggies and take the stairs instead of the elevator.The tips in this book certainly aren't going to make you slim if you have the genetic predisposition to be fat. (And I'm not into shaming fat people by oversimplifying weight loss or implying they MUST to be worthy human beings.) It's a disappointing book whether you're a fitness freak or just a regular person who's unsatisfied with his or her body. Not sure who the target audience was, and neither was the author."
4,Good Advice,Good Advice but most info you've likely heard. Also There are occasional gems to be found and quotes that you add entertainment to the die-T. Also it's worth noting that the book is written in the UK so often it uses grams or stones as measurements and words like biscuits instead of cookies. So often the terms can be confusing for the US reader.
5,Children's music that I love as a parent!,"I had to travel in the car for over ten hours with three young children...what fun we had with Secret Anadarko! These are incredibly creative, emotionally charged songs, with charm, humor and an obvious love for animals. Every time you listen there is something more to hear...wonderful talent and E.L.has such a fantastic voice! When can we purchase the next one?"
4,Way of an ornamentalist,"A lovely tale of a young Chinese immigrant in South America offeres some insight to the ""way of a Chinese Grower"" and what the culture is like... The second half of the book goes into considerable detail as to how to cultivate the poppy, albeit on a quasi large-scale endeavor- not really for the ornamental grower. Excellent depth into pharmacologic properties, particularly chemical structure of medicinal components and traditional harvesting methods and tools."
3,Excellent resume resource for those without a clue,"This book will undoubtedly save time for those who are frustrated by the process of writing their own resume. Having reviewed more resumes than I can count at this point, I can fully appreciate the value in showing people how to scrutinize their own work. The trouble that I've found is that people are too close to their own histories to do a really good job of marketing themselves. They know too much. What this book shows as much as anything is that getting a professional review on a resume is worth the price."
5,What a refreshing book - it gets the job seeker excited !,"For once, a book that details a philosophy for writing resumes. This book gets you to think about the ""strategy"" behind the resume and has an abundance of new formats to offer. The fact that over 25 ""certified"" resume professionals from around the nation have contributed their best work to this publication makes this book the best I've ever seen!"
2,Resume a la Blande,"Snooze. Let we sheeple use these cookie cutter resumes to land corporate cookie cutter jobs that allow us to wear pretty plasic I.D.'s! If that's the future you want, here is the ideal starting point."
1,you will NOT get hired,"Let me preface this by saying I have NEVER failed to secure an offer from a job I have applied for.Now...This book sucks. I bought it because everybody gave it 5 stars, and I thought it wouldn't hurt to freshen up the old resume. Well let me tell you, it doesn't even deserve 1 star. The resumes (all 101 of them) were bland, boring, non-creative and will not land you a job of any kind, except perhaps a job writing resume-collections.I think, perhaps, that the author took all these resumes from the career center at his college.Don't spend the money on this book. Instead, do something fun with the money, you'll be a lot happier in the end. Go to the beach with the money. Heck, you may even meet someone and get a job that way before this book gets you one. This book is a total waste of your time and money.A monkey could write better resumes."
2,Boring and a waste of time!,"I bought this book based on all of the favorable review's and was greatly disappointed. As a recent college graduate in the humanities, I found it to be a big waste of time and money! If you are not interested in finding a job, buy this book!"
1,probably not new,"Received package in poorly wrapped, obviously previously opened box. Inside packaging also previously opened. Also very poorly secured within box. Nothing but trouble with image drum. I believe this was a used item being foisted off as new. Not at all like the picture shown. No Okidata packaging, nor sealed as they usually are. After trying all sorts of maintenance on printer, I think I will have to buy another image drum."
1,Rip off,"I bought this motor because it was suppose to be new not remanufactured, it cost twice the re-manufactured price. When it arrived it had Re-manufactured stamped right on the side of the motor. Other sellers advertised there motors as such but not Amazon. Wish i had time to return it but i needed to get the window fixed same day, they obviously count on this when they don't tell you about the motor."
4,Early Cray classic blues,"If you can find a copy of this its well worth getting. The recordings date from 1980 when Cray was only 27.This is a blues album through and through, full of Cray's distinctive bluesy guitar playing and souful vocals. This album only occasionally hints at the shift in direction towards Soul (particularly on 'I'm gonna forget about you') that Robert Crays later albums would take. There is a Brass section but mainly this provides subtle backing with the odd Sax solo. The songs are mainly Cray originals together with a few covers noteably 'Too Many Cooks' by Willie Dixon.On the downside the ten tracks only amount to 36 minutes. However if you can find a copy (it might have been reissued under a different name now) buy it, you won't regret it."
2,SMALL!!!!,I was shocked to receive these tiny little mini plates that have absolutely NO use! you cannot bake in them..they are only 1-1/2inches round. The measurements should be spelled out in detail and you should read details prior to purchase. They would be perfect for a child's dollhouse or kitchen! The only thing I liked was the color!!
3,It's a Magnifier,"I ordered this item on January 16 and received it January 21. It is not a hands-free item. You need to hold it up from the page for the magnification to work so you can't lay it on the page and keep your hands free to do something else like hold the book and read or prop it up and type from it. The clear plastic container it comes it states that it is best held 4"" up from the page being magnified. I wish it had stated that in the description for this product. I would not have purchased it in that case. I wanted it so that I could inconspicuously magnify the words in my book while reading on a moving city bus. I rated it 3 stars because it does work but it lost 2 stars with me for not forewarning in the description that it needs to be held up and away from the item being magnified."
2,bad buy,i got this for school. some of the data in my Excel book was small. It does not work very well. i wouldn't recommend it
3,Full Frame Page Magnifier,"Bought for a friend that complains about print being too small. It was an in-expensive gift so I didn't expect much.. and with good reason. It is flimsy and unless you lay it directly on the page (which gives you very little magnification) it it hard to read while trying to keep it rigid. Don't expect to read labels on pill bottles, but for reading the newspaper or a magazine it is ok."
4,Very effective at controlling lighting,"I used the PortaCube to photograph several items to sell on ebay. It eliminates distractions in the background and reflections. I would prefer that the background cloth was a little whiter, but that is a small issue to me. It took me a few minutes to figure out how to set the thing up, as there are no real instructions. Just remember to keep your light sources consistent. If you set this on the table under incandescent lighting, then use a flash, you may end up with a mess."
3,elegant bling,"A beautiful piece for a steel watch. Can be worn for casual dress or formal. A large watch but very thin with a good clasp. No date and day, and somewhat diff to see at night, but a classic piece none the less. Comes with an oversize band for the largest male wrist.(I removed two links for my use)."
3,Seems like the author did not tested the recipes,"I completely with Jazzbrat, I tried 12 recipes from this book and many of them had to be baked much much longer because of overabundance of liquid per dry ingredients. I am glad that you mentioned it.Some of the recipes are great(macaroons,truffles,pain perdu), however some of the others were not tested by the author."
2,"Looks good, but somewhat disappointing","I'm macrobiotic, so i always look for good macro and vegan cookbooks. These recipes look especially beautiful, and I was excited to try them for special occasions, but I have to wonder if someone has actually tried them out.They are often very involved and require special ingredients and equipment (madeleine pans anyone?) and still don't turn out looking as you'd expect. This is especially disappointing after all the work, if it's for something special."
4,Excellent receipes,Sometimes there are a lot of ingredients but the end result is wonderful. Healthy desserts that are healthy! Reasonably priced & I feel it was money well spent.
3,"very good lots of different types of music, great lyrics","good roots music, you can tell these guys have been around a while, rock, blues, funk, folk, a little bit of everything. Lyrics were really cool"
5,BEAUTIFUL,"A very nice composition, for this Miniseries, my collection has been enriched with this CD, with music composed by Patrick Williams."
2,Tom Grounds - Something That I Wanted You To Know,"Great energy and some good music, but there are some SERIOUS intonation issues - fingernails on chalkboard kinda stuff."
1,Certainly not for me...,"A pregnant young girl is kidnapped by a wacko couple, members of the religious right who call each other Mommy and Daddy. They keep her chained in a room in the basement watching anti abortion tapes. They put an iron mask over her head. They murder her friend. In the end she escapes and the huge political conspiracy involved in ""kidnapping pregnant girls and holding them captive til they give birth and then keeping the babies and murdering the mothers"" is exposed. This book was annoying."
2,Not an Andrew Neiderman type,The book is predictable just from the begining. Very poor in argument and innocently writed.
2,Horrible Battery,"The rechargeable battery pack lasts an entire 10 minutes! And don't even attempt to find a company on-line to complain to, no such animal exists. Other than that, keep it plugged in all the time (could buy a regular DVD player for about 30 bucks if that was the point) Not mobile at all. Spend your money somewhere else"
3,Good for the summer,We have about 3 or 4 of these cups I like them in the hot TX summers beacuse of the gel center keeps drinks cool for a long time.The only problem with these cups is I don't think that they are BPA free so we have quit using them until I can find out more about the company.
1,Bad movie,"Both the acting and picture quality are so bad you'll think you're watching someone's school project made with a home camcorder.I thought this was a comedy. Its not, it just a cheap movie about 3 nerds driving around town trying to get some, while trying to avoid the neighborhood ""thugs"".Don't buy this movie. Its not funny!!!"
4,Low budget...but entertaining,"This movie wasn't as bad as some of the crap I've seen low budget that looks like it was shot on home cameras. True, some of the shots look amateurish but the story is pretty good and the commentary was interesting. The effort was there but the budget was lacking. The cover makes it look like it's a high budget film but it isn't...but I would not say this movie flat out sucks by any means. My vote is worth a look because of some of it's insightfulness."
5,Into the blue perfume by Escada,"Into the blue,a fragrance by Escada.The perfume is light and sexy.I love it! I have trouble selecting a fragrance that is good on my skin.This is great!"
3,Wipers,Was not impressed. I like the Bosch brand and thought these would be killer blades. I still have them on a few years later but they weren't great from the get go and still miss some spots when windshield not fully wet. Probably would have been better off getting cheap pairs and replacing sooner.
2,Ahhhh,"Alrighty, that other reviewer; people who own the product review it, not idiots who just read the description. Well, im soooo dissapointed with this buy. I thought there would be live shows, interviews, and crowd reactions-type stuff; but this barely has any live shows. Its basically a documentary on how the crew sets up everything, and how the band feels like on the Warped Tour.For less than 10 bucks, i didnt expect alot. But this is crap. Go out and get the other warped tour dvd~if you like those bands, because they have some great live shows. Peace"
3,good,"if not for the audio i would give this dvd possibly a 5. but the audio is like a 10 year old copied blank cassette tape.terrible. other than that if your a fan of punk and its culture, other than the horrible turned up till stereo sounds noisy its a great dvd. maybe video wise better than expected."
5,Great DVD,"I really enjoyed this DVD. It contains a collection of some of the most beautiful piano concertos played by the renowned Italian pianist Maurizio Pollini. The visual aspect of this DVD is not that spectacular, you just see an orchestra with pianist performing the work, no audience. However, for you pianists out there, enough shots of the hands, great learning stuff. These are obviously the best performances of these concertos available on DVD. I feel that there are maybe better performances available on cd,like Zimerman/Bernstein for the Brahms, Michelangeli for the 3rd Beethoven, Anda for Mozart. The Emperor however is one of the best available.I really enjoyed this DVD, you can't go wrong buying it, great value! Enjoy."
4,the Misfits go western,"I think the title says it all. Combine the Misfit's love of B movies and mix in the american western. While Ghoultown is every bit as alternative country as it is punk, I think it is a good combination. This isn't a CD you will listen to every day but it still finds it't way into my CD changer on a regular basis."
1,not worth my dime,"I bought this on a whim. bad move. it's definitly unique, but annoying. it's a western, and i mean the whole album. they sound like an old western movie, and his voice is nothing to write home about, in fact i'm wasting my time with this. if your into goth rock and dark stuff, do NOT waste your time with this."
4,Clear windscreen after wipe.,The windscreen is very clear after every single wipe. But lines a visible too after every wipe which the product claims otherwise as compared to conventional blade.
1,streak like mad,"Bought these for my 04 VW Passat to replace the original 5 year old blades. Worked fine for the first rain, but after that streaked like crazy. I usually buy Bosch products because of the VW connection, and they have a good reputation, but this product is worse than my 5 year old blades. Plus at the money they cost they should be perfect."
1,Fool me once ...,"I had a pair of these a year ago, and I remember being miffed at how soon I had to replace them for streaking very badly. A matter of two or three months, as I recall.Well, along comes this rebate (which I haven't even received yet) that makes me think about trying them again. Sure enough, after FIVE weeks they are starting to streak again! Bah!I'd give them 1.25 stars - they do a beautiful job for the first few rains, then they're junk.Save your money."
1,"Bosch 422A ICON Wiper Blade, 22"" (Pack of 1)","Bosch 422A ICON Wiper Blade, 22"" (Pack of 1) when new they worked. But for the cost of these blades they should last more then a few months NOT HAPPY"
3,Glad that I Waited to Review,"At first I was VERY pleased with the 4 blades that I purchased last April. Now in October I am not so pleased. Initially, the blades did a great job with not squeeks. My van is garaged, but after several months the blades started to streak - stil no squeek. Now the driver's side blade is leaving a BIG streak - right at eye level. I thought that there was dirt on the blade, but I removed it and with a magnifying glass, there is a minute chunk of rubber out of the blade. I just switched the bad blade to the passenger side. Now I will go to the local parts store and buy new ANNCO Blades for 1/2 the cost. I can change the blades twice as often for less than what I paid for the Bosch - I just hope the squeek does not return. My bottom line - For a few months the Bosch blades are great- but after that it's all downhill. Once again - I am glad that I waited to review this product."
1,Not worth the money,"Bought these blades on the recommendation of the auto parts store sales person. They came with a buy one get one rebate, so I figured, ""What the heck!"" The blades worked fine for a month or so, but then started streaking badly across the top 1/4 to 1/3 of the wiper path, leaving a streak right through my field of vision. The Bosch Micro-edge or plan old Anco blades with frame work just as well, cost much less and last much longer. Don't waste your money on these expensive pieces of trash."
1,Don!t waste your money!!,"These are on a 1999 Jeep Cherokee in Buffalo, NY. I usually buy nice silicone baldes maybe once every 2 years. I was due for a new set so I picked these up, they looked nice, new design, useful for winter? i thought i was getting a deal. after one year june08-june09 (through the winter) i noticed that they started to fall apart. The end caps came off of either side of both blades after the first 4 months, i was ok with this b/c they still worked great. now the passenger sides blade is tearing and leaving approx. 8in streaks, not acceptable!! i could have easily purchased a cheap $5.00 set of blades and they would have performed just as well. Save your money and get triple edge silicone blades, they sell them at walmart, pepboys and advanced auto, they are much cheaper and actually last!"
2,"Good, but annoying.","I would have given this 4 or 5 stars, but after I put them on, they wipe fine, except there is a triangle part in the middle of my windshield that the passenger side wiper, DOES NOT WIPE. It seems as though my windshield is curved and this wiper does not curve with it. The driver side works well, but I'm very disappointed with the passenger side. I guess I will just have to live with these till they wear out though because I'm not about to buy another pair when I just purchased these."
2,Streaks and short life,"The guy at the store even questioned if it was worth it -- those are the most expensive we carry he said. But the car was new to me, and I was not in a mood to compromise. I expected good wipers, I got terrible ones. Streaks, and rapidly deteriorating performance. They did not last through even a half mild California winter."
2,Not that great,"I got these for my 08 Hyundai accent earlier this year. They seemed great at first, but later they just started leaving water streaks. It's not that they don't wipe the water well, but that they pull the water back across the windshield whenever they go back down. It's incredibly annoying. I really liked the mechanical look of these, but they just don't do the job in all situations. The work great in heavy rain, but whenever it's a small shower or I just use my washer fluid, they pull the water back across the windshield and streak it. I wouldn't recommend them to anyone with my car."
1,3 months tops,"Paid the price , but they lasted only about 3 months. After that they left such streaks that you couldnt see out of the windshield. does anyone have a suggestion of what is the best wiper blade?"
5,Amazon should specify two different blades required.,"You need an ""A"" for driver's side and a ""B"" model blade for the passenger side. The way the seller is listing these you'd never know !"
2,"Used to be good, now not so much...","I've been using these wiper blades for several years, and was quite satisfied with them - they were better than the cheap wipers most service centers put on my car...However, the last two sets I've purchased have been sub-par, streaking within a few weeks of use, and needing to be replaced after two months of light use... With snow and ice, the wipers were not effective at clearing the windshield to the point where it was dangerous to continue driving.I'm guessing the formula and construction of the wiper has changed. Given the price, I would be hard-pressed to purchase these wipers in the future."
2,Not very good,For the amount that these cost over regular wiper blades I was expecting something amazing. At first they worked quite well but the quality of the wipe deteriorated quickly. After carefully cleaning them using rubbing alcohol they start to work better but it doesn't last long. I'm sticking with cheaper wiper blades next time since they last just as long and do just as good of a job.
3,OK but not great,The Bosch is ok but not great...people on the internet made them sound better than they were. I personally liked the trico neoform beam blades better and I got them online for about $15. The neoforms are also the newer style frameless wiper blade and they have a teflon coating to keep them from chattering.
2,"Great at first, 3 months later have to buy new pair..:0(","Like the other reviews, these blades are awesome at first. I think they cleaned better than my OEM wipers. However after 3-4 months of use, streaks on my windshield got to a point I could not even see the road. I am surprised, a product of German engineering would not last as long as a cheap wiper. Oh well.. $30 down the drain...thought I was getting a good product for that price..Most people write review in the first month and dont update on product performance after. I made the mistake first time around. Read all the updated reviews on Amazon past 60 days and their story sounds same as mine...."
2,"Streaks, streaks, streaks","Man I had streaks like crazy on the driver side. passenger side was OK. They did hold up well for the time I had em. so there durable, just not good for me."
1,Worse then the stock blades,"Always leaves a water trail when it goes trough.On driver side, it drags water/ice back from the corner of the windshield back to the center, so it's never clean.And last, but not least... bosh mail in rebate claims they have never received my mail.. Funny how only mail in rebate letters gets lost in USPS...This blade and bosh mail in rebates service are jokes."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"Last Fall, I bought a set of Bosch blades for my wife's Tahoe and for my Prius. In less then 1 month, both sets were leaving streaks and water lines on the windshields. In my 33 years of buying wiper blades, they are the worst!"
1,Worst wiper blades I have ever used- At twice the price!,"I bought them for winter weather because they were sealed in rubber so not to get stuck and not function. They worked OK until snow and ice came. After a snow day it wouldn't wipe the glass clean. It left big streaks so I could hardly see out to drive safely. Then one day after it snowed out I cleaned off the car good and started the windshield wipers up and the driver side(unlucky side) broke off and fell to the ground. It broke off the top side of the wiper blade where it connects to the arm.I paid twice the price for these and got only 5% of normal life out of them. Never will I buy these again. I will go back to Anco winter blades. I never had a problem in 30 years with them. (The store didn't have any Anco winter blades when I needed them, so I tried these)Big mistake for winter weather!"
4,Worthwhile Purchase,"Are they the best available ? I don't know but they are good. They don't freeze in winter or hold ice to them. They whip the windshield clear. Look good. Reasonable priced.I've had them over a year and they are still working fine. Granted I don't drive this car much; 2000 miles a year and it's always garaged, not out in the weather; but for me they are still and good and have proved to be a worthwhile purchase."
1,Worthless,"It is a useless blade in the winter. The rubber doesn't hug the windshield. The wiper holds snow like all others do. Broke 2 weeks into a Minnesota winter.I rate this item a zero, but it makes me give 1 star. Too much money for a below average wiper."
5,Pure thought,"Though largely unknown outside of certain obscure academic circles, Theodor W. Adorno was, without a doubt, the foremost socio-political theorist of the 20th century. For truly intelligent, literate, questing minds (free of occultist nonsense) Adorno's MINIMA MORALIA is absolutely indispensible. A compendium of always eloquent, surprising, mournful, and deeply humane musings on modern capitalist society in all its terrible unfreedom, this book is among the most uncompromisingly radical ever written (cf. Max Stirner's THE EGO AND ITS OWN). To read and understand Adorno--even imperfectly--is to experience the tremendous pleasure of being in the presence of impeccable historical awareness, great moral rectitude, and visionary wisdom."
5,"try it, you'll love it",I've been using a RollerMouse (original non Pro) since 2004 on a daily basis. It greatly reduced the amount of mouse or trackball related RSI as I no longer needed to leave the keyboard area to use a pointing device. Highly recommended. I regularly use it with dual and wide screen monitors on Linux (X11).
5,I luv this CD,"Ever since i saw Crybaby i have wanted this CD.. the movie was great and this CD is great too.. to all the people who haven't seen the movie or listened to this soundtrack, i highly recommend u do so.. AND SOON!!"
4,by janxd..,"yes..leaving songs off the soundtrack is criminal & annoying. When will they release the Female Trouble, Mondo Trasho, Desperate Living soundtracks???tell me that huh??/waaaaaaaaaaa"
5,This album rocks!,"I am so in love with the movie and couldn't wait to get the cd you will not be dissapointed,the album contains ever single song from the movie,unlike other movies that short you a song or two from the soundtrack. but this album rocks and vocals on it are devilish and wonderful! you will love this album."
4,AWESOME,The album is has everything for the hip cat or cool chick who loves Rockabilly music. All the great tracks from the movie are on this album. And if you like James Intveld this is a must have. Totally rock'n.
1,Get REAL!! This is NOT!!,"I go crazy when people say that ""they just LOVE American Indian music"" - and they don't have a CLUE as to what REAL Native American music IS!! Just because somebody decides that it (sorta) sounds ""Indian,"" that's what they are going to sell it as - and there are soooo many who buy this type specifically because it is thus deemed ""acceptable."" Not a ""How, waumpum, heya, heya,"" anywhere to be heard!This CD may contain music that is ""played"" on a NA flute and other instruments... And the ""Various Artists"" are noted as ""Indigenous,"" but that is extremely doubtful!! Why aren't ""they"" proudly listed?WARNING: Almost every single cut on this CD begins with a loud, piercing note blown on a flute - gave me an instant earache and headache!!"
2,Yet Again,"This is NOT a new Alice Cooper album. It has been kicking around for thirty+ years under various titles. The Vinyl copy I bought about twenty years ago was called ""Alice Cooper: Live at the Toronto Rock 'n' Roll Revival 1969."" I also have a cassette titled ""Freak Out Song.""I cannot recommend this album. Alice never released it, it is just a bootleg that somehow gets release every few years. Two of the song on the album are not even Alice. Alice make no money on this album and has tried to stop people from releasing it."
1,This is a bad albulm,"This is not a new albulm at all, but an albulm that keeps having its tracks rearranged and retitled and resold. This albulm is bad. It sounds like a drunken live albulm. Each and every song falls apart. Most of the time it doesn't even sound like they are playing the same song. If you think you want to hear these songs, then buy the boxed set and hear the best of them done right. The only clear song on the albulm is Aint that just like a woman. But the rest of the albulm is bad."
1,Science Fiction...an appropriate name,"Having been an Alice fan since 1972, I was surprised by this latest release...is it Alice, Elvis or the Byrds..hard to tell. One can certainly hear some of his earliest inspirations in this odd mixture of sound (I hesitate to say music). My husband and I were fortunate to attend the final dress rehearsal for Brutal Planet in Phx in May...now THAT'S Alice at his best! Just like a fine wine, Alice you get better with age."
1,What's going on!,"Looking around my local music store, what should I see, BRUTAL PLANET coming soon! Imagine my luck when I find out there's another album out soon, but hang on... What's going on? Is this even by Alice cooper, because it sure don't sound like any of his other albums, *especially* the newly released Brutal planet. I'm a huge Alice fan.. but sorry Alice these tracks are just plain strange."
4,COOPER,THIS ONE IS WORTH GETTING AND IT IS NICE TO SEE THAT ALICE IS GETTING BETTER WITH AGE BUT IN MY BOOK HE HAS ALWAYS BEEN AT THE TOP
4,local rock,"i've seen these guys live two times and both times i thought they were great, some of the songs were much more like cali-rock and it's too bad these guys are trying to succeed in the jacked-up 'burque scene. i'm the only guy i know with this cd so buy it and support local music."
3,"Great information, but often poor writing","I recently completed reading this book, and I have noticed that there is indeed a lot of good information in it. However, I must side with the one reviewer on the book's rather poor writing. Once you get past this, though, it is a good book."
1,Simply terrible.,"This book is badly written, pretentious, and boring. Finding the point of what the authors have to say requires wading through a wasteland of florid prose and awkward writing. This is just another example of bad English pretending to be erudition.The truly sad thing about this is that one of the authors is actually on staff at a university English department"
3,"Repetitive, Repetitive, Repetitive","As a graduate logistics management student, I found this book very monotonous to read. Every three paragraphs reiterated what Dr. Blanchard stated three paragraphs previous. The concepts are great, and he leans heavily toward military applications. There are, however, some uniquenesses that military applications have that civilian industry does not.As a professional military logistician, a good deal of the book was a restatement of the obvious. However, to a civilian graduate student with little logistics experience, this book would be very tough to swallow.Three stars is probably generous."
5,A GREAT ATHLETE WITH A DARK PAST,"Before I read this book, all I ever knew about Terry Sawchuck was that he was the greatest goalie ever to play the game of hockey. After reading this book I found out how a great athlete of the past is so much like the athletes of today. Sawchuck was an alcoholic womanizer who physically and mentally abused his family. This book tells a compelling story about his personal life and the greatest moments from the games he played. This book is a must for any hockey fan."
5,The greatest sports book I have ever read!!!!!,Being a sports fan I have read many sports books but none as good as David Dupuis's book on Terry Sawchuk. The book was so indepth and personal that I couldn't put it down. I truly believe that this is the greatest story ever told about a sports legend!!! I can't wait until the movie!!!
3,"Scary, if you think about it","The overall concept is kinda fun to think about - that dreams are collected at the end of the night by a guy who works like a trash collector each morning - but when you really think about it, a child could get seriously frightened by the idea that dreams can become reality once the sun rises, AND that the dream collector who is supposed to prevent this from happening can have a breakdown and let it happen anyway. I wouldn't recommend this story for the easily frightened or the very young child or the child who is having trouble with nightmares, though parents might find it amusing in concept."
3,"Nice features, poor in darkness","I like the atomic and solar features of this watch. I never have to set the time or date. However, after only 8 months of use, the battery is no longer holding a charge and so I think I need to have the battery(s) replaced. In addition, it is very hard to tell the time at night. It has a light that comes on but only stays on a maximum of 2 seconds. With all the items on the face, it's hard to read the time in 2 seconds in the dark. Also, the gold trim shown in the picture is very light in reality. It almost can't be distinguished from tht silver tone. Otherwise, the features are very nice and it is accurate to within a few seconds. I have not been able to contact Casio yet about any warranty service because their web site is down and there is no phone number listed in the manual."
4,Satisfied Customer,"I've owned this watch for about a month and am quite happy with it. At $80 it is an excellent value, (about $250 on casio website). It is very easy to set and adjust when changing time zones by modifying the GMT offset. Everyone seems amused to watch the hands move after adjusting the time. It keeps good time and the battery is always fully charged. I do not use it in darkness so cannot verify to other reviewers comment. The only minor complaint is that the brushed stainless steel and gold trim scratch easily. The mineral face has not scratched."
3,Very clear and well narrated TaiChi movements.,"I found the DVD easy to follow. Claire Hooton does a good job of explaining each movement, when to pick up which heel, when to move to 70-30 position in relation to arm movements, etc... It is more than just positioning of the body, but exactly how to flow into the those positions. I also enjoyed the beginning 6 Tai Chi principals. A good DVD for beginners."
4,Nice Looking.,"The cover is not as dark as I was hoping it would be, but it still looks very nice on my car. I was hoping it came with screws, but it does not. It comes in two pieces, so if you do not want to use one, you can use the other which I like."
2,Broken within a few months,"I though the look of it was fine for my car but it did feel cheap and if you look closely it does not look that impressive either. When mine arrived one cover was chipped along the edge which did not really bother it was just a bummer. What bothered me was that the entire cover broke (the one that was not chipped) within two or three months of using it. I didn't hit anything with my car and it doesn't look like anyone backed into me or when it was parked. So, sadly, it seems like a pretty cheap product to me.The frames are still fine though so I plan on leaving those on my car for now."
3,Darker would be better,Not as dark as the picture makes them look. But they were only like $9. they still look great on my car!
4,"A Fitting Tribute, but could use a 2nd volume","Tommy McCook was an excellent saxaphonist and leader of the legendary skatalites band during their short exsistence. He then went on to work for Treasue Isle and producer Duke Reid, leading his rocksteady session band, the supersonics.This particular tribute(released shortly after his death)gives a relativelty good overview of his days at studio one, presenting such big hits as exodus, ska ba, freedom sounds, and latin goes ska, as well as some excellecnt lesser known tunes. Though this is a good showcase of tommy's ska days, its a shame not see his excellent time he spent at treasure isle at all represented. A good buy for an intro to the skatalites or the genious of tommy, but i would love to see another volume."
4,Great Product,"I tried buying a cheaper printer server from Fry's, but I couldn't locate printers on our network that used PostScript from our Macs. Once I downloaded ""HP Network Printer Installer"", I hooked all of our PC's up in no time. The Mac's went fairly quickly as well. Though, I did have to uninstall, and reinstall some of the other printer drivers."
2,An almost entirely empty album,"I bought this album because I had had Vivaldi Recomposed for a few weeks and I found it truly delightful.But this album, ladies and gentlemen, ain't no Vivaldi. Apart from a few minutes of reasonably good content, it's mostly sparse, languid, amorphous stuff. Mr. Richter must have confused minimalistic with featureless.This could be adequate listening for a certain mood and in certain circumstances, but not for serious enjoyment. The lack of direction, character and narrative completely deflated my attention in a few minutes."
4,Moody Blue Notebooks,"This was referred to in one of Alexander McCall Smith's books, 44 Scotland Street, and I was curious, so I purchased it. It is interesting, complex, maybe a bit ""old fashioned"" and I was glad to add it to my collection."
1,Misrepresentation,"I ordered a pink Silicone Skin Case for the Wii remote and nunchuck but recieved a white one. Needless to say my daughter was disappointed because she wanted the blue one. After 4 emails with no help or resolution to the issue I gave up and kept the black covers. This seller has very poor customer service skills, and they misreprest their product. I would have been satisfied with some type of response!!!! Buyer Beware!!!!"
1,Don't waste your money,If you have rechargeable batteries this is a total waste of money. It comes apart while you put it on and then all the lint n such sticks to it once you get your hand sweat on it.
1,tears easily,"since you have to peel back the cover in order to either change batteries or recharge the battery pack, this skin tight skin is very difficult to remove and easily tears. it lasted 1 day for us before it tore at the bottom. would not recommend."
1,wii control skin,this product was well below my expectaions. it tore upon install and has no excess for batterys and will tear when removed. this is a one time use product
5,Well written and well focused,"One of the most powerful definitive works on what one needs to do when mentoring or helping others. Training, Leading and Coaching at Work answers the often raised questions about mentoring - a good idea in theory, but what do I actually do?TLC at Work provides real situations and real responses that all can learn and put into immediate use in the workplace. This book should be required reading for all University Students no matter what field of study they are in. Used as a reference guide, it will help the professors understand the students and will help the students advance more quickly in their careers. A must read! TLC at Work will lead to people describing their workplace as one that supports a TLC attitude to the staff."
5,Works great and better than cheaper ones,I had a Channel Plus modulator for 10 years that just stopped working (can't complain too much after 10 years!). I bought a cheaper one from Nyrius but returned it because the picture quality was terrible. This one works great.I use it to watch cable TV on multiple TVs in my house.
5,great pans,"These pans are great, nothing sticks to them. I baked a pie, set on top of the pan, and the burnt overflow stuff just slid right off."
3,"Good price, but flimsy","I was really happy to find 2 cookie pans for this great price. However, the pans are a little too thin and bend and twist slightly when in the oven. I've only used them a couple times so far. I am planning to buy a couple Chicago Metallic pans to replace them."
1,I've never burned cookies in my life!,"These pans are terrible!!! I've been baking for 30 years, never burned a cookie in that entire time. I just bought these pans for my holiday baking and they are ridiculous! Cookies are burned on the bottoms, tops are light-colored so you couldn't even tell. The pans are now scorched and no amount of scrubbing will remove the discoloration. The only thing I didn't try was a scouring pad because that would remove the non-stick surface. Very disappointed and my whole first batch is ruined. I'm afraid to bake anything else on these now, guess I'll go back to my old pans. :(("
2,Everything sticks,"Everything I bake sticks to these pans. They are a nice heavy weight, but are not usable without a silicone liner. I have a pair of very battered 45-year-old pans that work much better. Other reviewers have had better experiences, so perhaps not all of these are the same."
5,Good Choice,I bought these cookie sheets for my daughter who does a lot of baking and she is extremely pleased with them. Great price for this product also.
1,A Family's Home Video to Avoid,"Amateur footage going in and out of focus, voiceovers that frequently don't match the footage, more shots of the family than of Kenya (halfway into the video we're still watching daughter with swimmies in the resort pool!), scenes that are repeated and/or drag on too long, narrator that drones, and music that distracts made this video excruciatingly painful to watch. Categorizing this as a ""travel guide"" to Kenya is a gross misrepresentation..."
1,Error on price?,"I like the Airborne Gummis but is there a mistake here? Why is six pack of boxes almost $40??? These usually go for $2 to $3 dollars a box, that's $12 to $18 for six boxes. That's about what I paid last time when I purchased them from Amazon. I think they were directly from Amazon (I was able to use Prime shipping). I certainly hope no one buys them at this price."
3,Any Science on This?,"Has there been any scientific review of this product? I get that it was invented by a teacher, and it is supposed to prevent airborne colds, etc., but is it anything more than a placebo?"
4,Fun Show That'll Make You Laugh Out Loud.,"If you're already a fan of Insomniac, you'll enjoy this DVD. It's nice to sit down and watch several episodes uninterrupted. Just because it's uncensored you shouldn't expect it to be too wild....just a few more expletives. It's pretty darn funny. Even if you've never watched the show before you may become a fan. Besides, it's at such a low price it's worth trying out."
2,"If you're a huge fan, buy it, otherwise, just watch TV ...","I'm a relatively big fan of the show, I always at least skip through when it's been recorded on the TiVo, even if I've seen the episode before.So when I got the DVD, I was expecting not only less censoring, but also some extras, hopefully some not-aired footage, etc.All they have on the DVD is a handful of episodes, which are less censored then the TV version. You hear people swear, there's one or two women flashing, but that's all that's different. No extra features or anything.So my opinion is to just watch the show and let your mind fill in the censored parts. If you really want to have the DVD, buy it used. Hopefully the next DVD will have something more that's worth the money."
4,A good packaging of a great show,"I was a little dissappointed by some of the episodes Comedy Central decided to put on this DVD (say Montreal, as an example). Not that any of the episodes were bad, just there were better episodes a long time fan like myself thought were funnier.As well it might have been better for Comedy Central to just do seasons on a release rather than a handful of episodes. But Comedy Central seems to have no idea how to do releases of their shows on DVD (save The Man Show).Either way this is a great show and a nice introduction to the drunken late night subject that is Insomniac."
2,Uncensured.........Ho.....Hum......,If you've seen the show on Comedy Central then you won't see much more on this dvd.
5,funny guy,"This show is on comedy central and is very funny. This dvd is uncensored and contains season one. Other things that I considerer funny are office space, something about marry, and the howard stern show. so if you like those things than you will probably like this. Dave Attell is really really funny. He's the man. So buy this DVD. This dvd would be a great gift item for anyone who has a sense of humor."
3,So So,"A pale venture into ""Taxicab Confessions"" territory - a kind of demimonde escapade that never gets going.It's dragged down by the need for a punch line or a gag and the result is that the viewer is left without that vicarious thrill of checking into the dark side with a trusted guide. Too much of the comedy central attitude and not enough of the HBO cutting edge."
3,Bio-Gel,"This really works great but is rather pricey. It does not eliminate odor from bowel waste. But it is a necessity for ""night visits"" when camping or boating.Make your own: use a zip lock bag for outer bag, a 4 gallon trash bag for inner. Put a baby disposble diaper in bottom for absorbance (remove the outer plaster side), a little baking soda and voila! You can make them up ahead. When done using, place inner bag inside ziplock and dispose properly."
4,What a turn-off,Australian buyers beware. I have successfully ordered this product from Amazon before. The last time however I was unsuccessful because it was held up in US outgoing customs for so long it was returned to sender. Despite several emails to Amazon they provided no reason as to its delay. At least I knew because of order tracking. All I got was standard text messages inviting me to reorder and I would (perhaps) get a credit for non-delivery in about a month's time - at least two months after I had ordered and paid. I am still waiting.In summary a piss-poor customer service effort the only bright spot of which was that I was able to figure out the delay because of the order tracking facility.
4,Don't get me wrong...,"...I do love Naked Raygun's later work, but I put this one in most often. It sure is primitive, and noisy, and lo-fi, and that's why I like it. To me, songs like ""Bombshelter"" and ""Tojo"" and ""Tell Them"" from the 1980 session embody in my mind what I think real punk rock is. Not quite as melodic as their later punk-pop (NOT pop-punk, mind you) outings, but still it isn't completely user-unfriendly.Oh, and ""Potential Rapist"" (will Amazon let me say that?) is a gosh darn classic. One of the best songs ever written.Trivia time, guitarist Santiago Durango, and singer Jeff Pezzati were both doubling in Big Black around the time this record came out, around the same time that Big Black's ""Bulldozer"" was released."
3,Interesting,"For true Raygun fans only. A very raw recording including NR's first album (which had been deleted when the band was still around) and some rare outakes of a previous session. While some of the songs are good, (Liar is one of their best songs in my opinion) it is merely a novelty to hear what the band sounded like before they were great. Albini has written better and said better things as well in the liner notes. Go buy Throb Throb first."
2,He was probably just funning us,"Some amusing stuff, marred by contributor William E. Simon's neanderthal offerings, e.g., ""multiculturalism"" as one of the ""Most Destructive Ideas in Public Life"" along with ""No-fault divorce"" and ""The welfare state,"" etc. His list of ""God's Greatest Gifts to Mankind"" includes Jesus Christ, heaven, the USA and the Bible, no kidding.Initially I thought that Rukeyser had lost a few I.Q. points, but then I realized that he did include ""the worst"" in the title. Sometimes the way to really embarrass people is to just quote them."
3,Calming and somewhat relaxing...,"For the money I found this to be a very nice collection of Native American/comtemporary music, really more than I expected. I purchased Spirit of the Wind in a boxset with Cries from the Earth. Both are very nice but I prefer most of the pieces on Spirit of the Wind. There are one or two pieces in which the volume of the flute recording is far too high for the rest of the piece and is done in too strong a manner, in my opinion but aside from that I am enjoying the collection and listen to it often, especially when I need to decelerate and uncomplicate my mind. For the price it is a very nice earthy deviation from all the other stuff I listen too including computer and TV noise. Thanks."
5,A Life-Changing Read,"This book is probably the best new-age metaphysical book I have ever read.John is a brilliant channeler. Even if you do not get the whole concept of channeling, you can still get everything you need out of this text.In the book, John answers most of life's most difficult challlenges, including race, disaster, abundance, personal choice, reincarnation and others. The answers that he shares in the book are absolutely profound beyond any measure. I can honestly say that if you are open to new ways of thinking about your personal purpose on the earth, this book will absolutely change your life for the better."
4,Cheaper by the Dozen - A Classic,"I agree with Sharon. The movie, Cheaper by the Dozen, along with the sequel, Belles on their Toes, are excellent movies - classics! They should be made available (in either DVD or VHS format) in a boxed set. I know I would buy it and from the reviews on this web page, others would too."
3,12 Kids Makes a Dozen by Savannah,"Savannah Kessler 3/6/06Cheaper By the Dozen (original version)Have you ever met a family that did everything in less than 1 minute? Well, in this story the father tries to save time. This is movie about a family whose father is determined to save time by doing everything as quickly as possible. In the end his work is rewarded when he is invited to give a speech to very important people in Europe. Of course none of this happens without hilarious and heart breaking events that give the family strength and bring the family closer together than ever. This is a funny movie with an unexpected ending. It will make you cry and laugh at the same time."
4,"Quaint, and so efficient...","Once upon a time there was a family unlike others, not ""Leave It Beaver"", but still homely. This family was the Gilbreth's, and whether it be their quirky father and his efficiency, or just the overall mood of the family, America was ready for the Gilbreth's, and thankfully the movie matched the successful book.For most, this will probably be just another old movie, so I plead at least read the book. But if you do consider watching this film, then the worth is there. This movie is short, entertaining, and even at times emotional. In addition, the re-make, if you can call it that, is very un-related, so it does not fulfill the need for this movie, and there is some need.So sit back, and be prepared to view an entertaining flashback into the 50's where life was simpler, although it took a whole lot of work to make it so."
4,Cheaper by the Dozen,My husband and I have watched this money since we were kids. I love this version more than the remake with Steve Martin.In this version it's the father not the mother that writes the book. Although he seems stern you can tell there he loves his family. I love Clifton Webb and seeing how things use to be. As a child it made me think differently about to get things done and I love his demonstration of how to bath. This is a classic family movie and touches my heart every time I watch it. It will make you laugh. Now if they could only put Sitting Pretty on DVD I would really be happy. That is my all time favorite Clifton Webb film. This is a terrific family movie and a timeless classic.
3,historical version,"The movie is a liitle bland, as per the writing of the times. It took me until the end before i figured out the 'message' of the play."
2,Bad Movie,"I usually love old movies and I loved the new Cheaper by the Dozen but I found this movie hard to follow, boring, and not funny."
1,10 minutes,I have just seen a little theater production of Cheaper by the Dozen and was looking foreward to watching the original movie version. The DVD was fine until the last 10 minutes whenit was unwatchable. Poorly reproduced and a dissapointment.
1,Cheaper By The Dozen,"My family loves this movie and we watch it annually. I am a devoted wife and mother of ten children. My husband is in Engineering and is very ""efficient"" and equally as proud of his brood. We highly recommend it as the movie is full of humor and is still relevant for today."
2,A disappointment for me,I thought the reviews for this movie were pretty good and decided to buy it. The father in this movie seems like an angry little man that is pretty eccentric. This movie just wasn't for me. I thought this was going to be more of a feel good movie. Instead I turned this off halfway through and couldn't watch anymore.
4,Cheaper by the Dozen -Clifton Webb,This is by far better than the remake. A definite must see. For a collector it is a must have. I really enjoyed all the problems that cropped up and were solved ingeniously.
4,Sirius music options better,"My only compliant is the limited Christian song lists. I have Sirius at home on Dish Network, and the Christian rock stations have up to date music with great variety. XM seems to play only eighties and early nineties Christian rock. Sirius divides rock into more catagories than XM, who only offers music by decades and Dance. On Sirius you can choose Hair Bands, Heavy Metal, etc."
2,"Great speaker, but stopped working twice during a gig","This is an amazing speaker - when it works. Twice, however, I've had it stop working in the middle of a gig. The first time, I sent it to Mackie and they repaired it. In the mean time, I got another unit and it, too, stopped working (I play with it at gigs probably three times a week, one hour at a time). I play with an amplified acoustic guitar, so I'm not pushing this speaker... Anyway, the sad truth is I don't trust it. I now carry TWO at all times. While the sound is amazing, Mackie should be embarrased that they make such an unreliable product. When I spoke to them, they didn't seem to know the issue - although there are posts online about it from other people who have had the same problem."
5,This is really compact,Just received the 'Mackie' and had a small test ... amazing sound for such a small thing ...
5,Best Poetry Book Ever,"For everyone who thought that poetry was all wine & roses, this book will definately prove otherwise. I've read a great deal of poetry in my life and none has ever been this good. Some of the poems read like riddles. The ones that require less deep thinking are still uniquely worded and some include clever twists that poetry too often lacks. While there is a good deal of profanity in this book, it makes the poems that much more interesting and modern. Blix Raven is a writer that understands his readers well and uses language that won't put teens to sleep. I've read it several times over, each time finding new meanings to the poems. If you only read one poetry book in your lifetime, make it this one."
3,Live baby live!,This is a necessary item to have for anyone who's a fan of the blood brothers because they were simply one of the best live acts PERIOD.If it's only a question of having something live from them then i suggest buying their burn piano island burn cd enchanced album that includes 2 live songs. it's not a dvd but it's still a live thing.everyone who's into hardcore should experience the blood brothers live at least once and the only way to do so now is through this release.
3,"Wow, that must be a really old show","I've seen the Blood Brothers live 5 times now and never have they sounded like that. I appriciate the ""listen to the blood brothers live"" aspect of it but the sound quality and the video is horrible. This kinda reminds me of Rumors Laid Waste. A peek at what the Blood Brothers have done that is not completely amazing. Die hard Blood Brothers fans...buy or download this. Everyone else...don't wast your time."
5,A great review of the Regiment and its people,"As an ex Rhodesian soldier I lived through the period covered by the book and had the great fortune to know some of the people involved in the regiment. The book is a gritty, factual account of the unit, the people and the politics of the day. As a salute to a great regiment and country, it stands tall in representing what the Rhodesian people stood for and their fight to retain their country.""Lest we forget"""
5,Customer Satisfaction Rating,As promised I am changing my rating for this gentleman and company. He and I reached an agreement on a partial refund. I appreciate the fact that he made contact and was committed to customer satisfaction. Mike
4,another jam from Guy,back in the day Teddy Riley and Guy simply couldn't lose. they had the jams and grooves to sho nuff keep you moving.this was another one of those cuts on there must have debut album that just kept your feet moving and head boping. another feel good cut.
5,Excellent little book,Exceptionally well written and idea packed little book in my opinion. A bargain for those wanting their thoughts provoked by a highly educated original thinker who uses language like a poet. A richly rewarding read and a beautiful little volume that I am most pleased to have on my shelf.
3,"Good intentions, not-so-good finished product","Take note that this book was among the first ever published in English on the topic of the history of Japanese language, and that the author is not a expert on historical linguistics nor language anthropology.The book is structured in time periods, and tries to give a overview of everything that has happened with the Japanese language since the earliest fragments available.It is, however, in dire need of a editor, as several statements are simply wrong, and a lot of semi-technical terms in Japanese are used without a single hint as to their meaning.As a piece of classical literature relevant to my area of study, I am glad I purchased it, but for the regular student I much rather recommend either the work by Chris Seeley or the more up-to-date, very impressive text by Bjarke Frellesvig"
4,"Come Here i want to tell you something,",This game was to easy i beat it within 3 hours. This game is perfect for little kids ages 5 and up. What i liked about the game the most was the music. It has great songs from the film and you have to make mumble dance to it. That was fun but the rest was okay.
4,Ty Keeps them Coming,Very cute! My 2 year old granddaughter is a Dora fan and she liked it very much. It was a success!
4,My daughter loves it,It's a great present for my two year old Dora fan daughter. She tooks it whereever she goes. Perfect size for small hands.
4,Dora is cute!,"My 3.5 year old son loves Dora and Diego! I thought for christmas I would get him his favorite characters because he has been asking for them. I got Dora, Diego, Boots, Swiper and baby Jaguar. They are all super cute and TY makes good stuffed toys, I just wish that Dora and Diego were a little bigger. BUT my son will love them and be able to take them all along with him in his rescue pack ;)"
1,Waste of money,"Hello All,I bought this doll as a gift for my daughter. i am so disappointed after opening the box and looking at the doll first time, i just logged in to write the review.I was expecting a bigger doll for the price, we get much better doll in target, walmart for lesser or same price. Also the face of the doll, does not look like Dora. I will let you know what my daughter's reaction is once i travel back.I will try and upload some pictures, the length of the doll is smaller than my wrist watch.Don't buy this doll. Hope this helps."
3,??Dora??,"It says it's Dora, it wears the same clothes as Dora...But something is off? Could it be the uneven eyes? maybe it's the square face. But one thing is for sure, the Dora we got looks even LESS like Dora then the pic. All that being said...I'm a grown up my opinion doesn't matter...What matters is that my 3 year old is totally and utterly in love."
3,Cute,My 18 month old daughter likes this. The hair is strange as are the eyes but she likes it as she can carry it with her.
4,Suitable tiny toy for my 16 months old,I choose the toy because my daughter twirls her hair gently so I am hoping she will sleep with this toy and twirl the wool hair instead. I gave it a 4 star because the toy was smaller than i expected. Other than that it was a good buy for the purpose.
4,Grand Daughter Liked it,"My Grand daughter is a Dora fan in every way. She has Dora all over her room. The doll was just a little something extra for her, not a main toy, but she does like it. Seems to be well made and durable."
3,LITTLE ONE DRAGS DORA EVERYWHER!,"Hello!A gift to my 2 1/2 yr old niece, she drags it everywher, she is big on what is current on Nick Jr. She is a Gabba Generation for sure, so Old School Dora was bit of a shock? Who knows what little ones find really entertaining? Dora thing is a good bet! if your shooting in the dark?"
5,Dora Addiction,My daughter will be receiving all the Dora and Diego crew for Xmas. She just loves them all so much!
2,Dora,The doll was made cheaply and so little that she does not play with it lately. It is lost easy for a three year old.
3,doesn't looks good,"I bought boots , swiper and few other dolls for my daughter . But this one doesn't look good its not cute as actual dora."
2,Really didn't feel like the usual TY material,The material for this beanie really didn't feel like the usual good quality material that Ty toys are usually made of.
3,Smaller than i was hoping,I know that there is a bigger one available but I thought this one would be bigger than it actually was when i recieved it..Doll looks good though and looks like it will hold up. The 3 yr old It is for will still love it.
5,My 3 Year Old Loves Dora,"We got this toy as an airplance travel distraction, and my daughter thought it was the best thing in the world... Until she lost it during the trip. We bought it again for her 3rd birthday, and she is still playing with it. It is one of her favorite toys at the moment, along with the Diego and Boots dolls.On second thought, I should have given Dora 5 star rating for educational value because it was very helpful during our trip to talk about maps and where we were going next. I love Dora, too!"
4,My daughter loves her,"My 2 year old daughter loves this doll. She is very cute. Within a minute of having her, she asked, ""where is the map???"" I made her a small map and put it in the backpack and she was happy."
1,An infomercial for Glenn Doman's Gentle Revolution.,"Some interesting stories perhaps, but little real data. The ""statistics"" are lightweight and sparse. Reads like an infomercial for Doman's Gentle Revolution."
1,unglued,"I was betrayed by a dog ""expert"" that swears by these that they're the greatest thing ever. I suspect Planet Dog has in fact betrayed them by letting their quality control slip. The green parts are glued on, but not very well. I don't leave any toys with my dog unsupervised but my puppy ripped Australia off and swallowed it in only a minute of play. Several of the other continents are peeling off and hanging my a thread. I felt like returning the ball with the green piece, poop and all."
2,Don't last as long as they used to...,"I got an orbee for a gift for my bulldog a few years back and it lasted about four years of off and on chewing. We have proceeded to give planet dog products to all friends with dogs, especially ones with a proclivity to chew up supposed ""indestructible"" toys over the past few years.However, since getting the new versions of the same toys, the dog has chewed right through them within weeks, sometimes within a day. Either the bulldog has gotten even stronger jaws during his fifth and sixth years of life or the orbee's have declined in quality. Based on the information I have on hand, I am going to lean towards the latter.I am pretty disappointed because I finally thought I found a dog toy brand that would last more than a week or two.This is a great toy and company for most normal dogs, but stay away from it for super-strong chewers."
2,Continents Come Right Off,"Our lab puppy is a medium chewer; compared to his puppy friends it takes him a relatively long time to finish bones and bully sticks.So I was surprised when minutes after being presented with the Planet Dog Orbee he was able to rip two continents off with little effort. Fortunately I was watching him and able to immediately fish these little green land masses out of his mouth (the first to go was the small island).The toy is really cute, but just beware that for teething dogs (or dogs who like to take things apart with their teeth) it presents a very serious swallowing hazard."
4,Tough,"One of the only toys that my giant-toothed Giant Schnauzer can't destroy in a week. Expensive but hey, if the dog's happy...UPdate 9/2012Still have this thing. The rope disappeared but the ball is indestructible and the Schnauz still plays with it. 5 star, at least."
1,not worth it,I bought this toy due to the fact it was rated excellent for tuff chewers by the company. my dog was threw the rope within 30 minutes of giving him the toy. 30 minutes later the shapes of the world landed in his stomach! This is the worst tuff toy I have ever purchased and I will demand a refund from the company. luckily I supervise my dog while playing with his toys or he probably would have eaten the whole thing!
1,Exploring the planet one piece at a time.,"Hello,This would've been a great toy, the blue ball part is pretty indestructible. However the green outline of the plant becomes a chewing expedition as the dog tries to get every piece off. Suggest making the same item with same materials but mold as one piece so it can't be seperated. Also secure the rope better, came apart first 5 minutes of playing."
2,Not worth the price,"The continent part comes off very easily. My GSD puppy chewed off the rope in one minute. I bought the orange ball and it glows very nicely. If you want to buy the ball, buy it without rope. The original rope will get chewed off anyway. So why not attach your own rope and save your money."
5,Great Toy,"My Doberman just loves this toy. Soft on the teeth and easy for her to carry around at the park. I don't use tennis balls because of the glue, so this is perfect! Will be getting a smaller one for my Pomeranians"
4,blue/green is wrong color.,"This blue/green ball is not easily found once lost. I find the orange/white ball is much more easily spied in the grass or water. It also has the advantage that it glows in the dark which is important as we have shortening days & then lose daylight savings time. There is no compelling reason to prefer the blue/green coloring. The orbee ball is super!! The dogs love the squishy, chewy quality. The rope lets me throw it farther, however I don't like the tied rope. I find any loops to be dangerous for active excited dogs. When I 1st get the orbee ball I get the knot outside the ball, undo it, put a metal washer on the rope. I then knot the end of the rope & push the knot in 1st, followed then by the washer. Now I cut the rope to the length I want & put a knot at the end so that I can play tug with my dog. There are admittedly better tugging balls-specifically the rope wing-a-ding ball by Booda."
1,No longer works,I was at the vet yesterday he told me advantage is not working on cats anymore. My cat is proof of that.He did tell me of a product called revolution.Hope that works!
5,A Surprisingly Sweet and Touching Comedy,"What starts out on the level of ""Kiss Me Guido"" or ""Just One Time"" dares to actually go one level deeper. If Woody Alan would ever get in touch with his feminine side, he could have written this screenplay.For film industry people, the plot, and its devices, requires a certain amount of suspension of disbelief at times (or at least the ability to close one eye occasionally), but the little surprises, twists and arcs will touch even the most jaded amongst us.Very commendable performances by both Michael Parducci and Peter Jacobson.Long live the indi film industry!"
2,Not Gay,This movie has a gay character but it's hardly more than incidental to the action which is slow and mundane.
4,Actually loved it!!!,"I was in Blockbuster one evening perusing the previously viewed dvd section of the store. I came across this film, picked it up, put it back down and picked it up again. I don't know what compelled me to buy it since every instinct I had told me it would probably stink. And, I had a reputation to uphold of only watching cutting edge foreign and art house films. But, I must admit to really enjoying this exceptionally sweet story. It's enormously entertaining. Try it, you may just like it!"
1,Or not....,"And I will in turn try to save you a few hard earned bucks. Bratiness is a long revered element of rock, but when unsupported by the ability to play, sing, or write songs, it falls short. Critics love this stuff, but they get it free. Unless you find yelping fun, pass."
4,Undertones meet The Fall,"That's what I thought when I bought this record on a friend's say-so. This may be useful to those of you over 40, or to those under-40 types who are familiar with the first wave of punk."
2,Didn't do wrestling and Gable justice,"I enjoyed this book because I am a die hard wrestling fan. It is so hard to find any book about the REAL sport of amateur wrestling, and so I devoured every word. However, I agree with others who write that ""something"" was missing. I think that that is because the author must not really grasp the nature of the sport as he certainly did not capture nor convey its essence, intensity or the spirit of the legendary coach. The writers lack of ardor coupled with lack of understanding for the passion involved within the wrestling family is what led , I believe, to the ""flatness"" of his account. I could have done better!!"
4,a great look inside the wrestling room and lockerroom.,"As a former wrestler and now a coach, the book gave a great look at the behind the scence of Iowa wrestling. the book shed some light on some of the rumors of the program. it also gave you a look at Dan who everyone wants to know about.I know most of the names and people in the book and remeber most to the event that the book looks at both past and present.Iwould recomend this book for any wrestling fan or wrestler."
3,How-to turning book.,"165 pages. 16 page color gallery. A technique book, not many projects, a lot of instruction on tool usage. Projects include: Box, Scoop, Light Pull Knob, Bowl, tool handle. Contents: The Lathe; Fixings: Drives, Faceplates & Chucks; Cutting Tools; General Approach; Measuring; Centerwork; Facework; Notes on Finishing; Gallery; Appendices: Troubleshooting; Selecting Timbers; Make a tool handle; Make a screw faceplate."
4,Turning wood with Richard Raffan,An excellent book for the beginner to the art of woodturning. It is an invaluable item to have alongside the lathe
5,Sandman,"This is a well written, well organized, wonderful book from a very giftedauthor. Great for someone just getting into wood turning and has pearls for the experienced turner. Highly recommended !!"
2,Okay made to be b-movie,"(...)P>The woman who played the main ""she-devil"" was okay. She had some pretty funny lines combined with lots of effort and bad acting. Script was senseless and photog pretty lame."
2,Lame,"Me and my cousin watched this movie on a late night thinking it might be good,but sorry i just didnt find it good,the killings were pretty fake to be honest,i only liked the dancing girls though,that was good enough,and the film seemed to short,i wouldnt waste your money on this,sorry i had to say this."
2,Ponnelle poorly served by remastering,"Unitel-DGG has remastered this marvellous performance poorly. The frame has been made smaller and much of Ponnelle's masterful placement of singers is lost as the singers on the left and the right are now out of the frame. Get the older video tape (1988) if you can. Otherwise, the sound is good and the singers great."
5,Glorious colours make this DVD a winner,"Compared to the old laserdisc release of this opera, this new DVD is a joy to behold. To my eyes much loving attention has been lavished on restoring and cleaning up this disc with the result that the colours throughout are rich and saturated. While the quality of the video has been significantly improved the audio remains about the same as the laserdisc---- the addition of 5.1 DTS does not really offer any audible differences over the PCM stereo which incidentally is very good indeed. The DVD now offers subtitles in five languages including English.In my opinion this production of the work stands head and shouldersover the competition. The entire cast, the musical direction of Abbado and the imaginative video direction of Jean-Pierre Ponnelle make this a winner all round. Standouts in the singers are von Stade and Montarsolo.Compared to other Unitel releases of Ponnelle operatic productions on DVD this is be far the best to date."
3,The cropping is a little tight,"This is a beautifully staged production with masterful singing. However, if you have not seen the original, uncropped version of this production I urge you to find a copy of the 1981 VHS filming of this masterpiece. It will enhance your appreciation for the incredible staging, because the DVD is cropped a bit tighter than the video.Part of the beauty of this production is feeling that you part of the audience. However, there are numerous tight shots that allow you to fully appreciate the expressions on the faces, almost as if you are looking through opera glasses.The director has a lot of fun with his performers, and sets up visual humor that is very entertaining. The singing, acting, and interaction of the characters is unsurpassed, in my opinion, but the loss of the margins of the staging causes me to give 3 stars, not 5 to the DVD. (Maybe I'm just partial to my old VHS version!)"
5,great first opera for kids!,"I've seen 2 other Cenerentolas, and this is by far the best.Cast is not just one superstar, but 6-7 really goodsingers in perfect form at the height of their careers.I think von Stade just retired this year here in the Bay Area.However, I'm commenting because this is my 3yo daughter'sfavorite DVD. In fact, when she sees Disney Cinderellaon screen, she says ""I want to see the real cinderella instead"".She's probably watched her favorite arias 50 times now.She knows the story, and since the actors expressionsare fairly expressive, she knows that ""she's sad"", ""thedaddy is angry"", etc.Both of the kids have seen various other operas includingBarbiere and Mozart's Figaro, but they have a hard timefollowing the story (and having your 8yo interrupt every30 secs to ask what is happening gets old). This operaalso has a lot more singing and very little recitativo.Show this to your kids early, show it to them often.And I don't have to listen to Barney in the background."
4,ScoopFree Anti-Tracking Carpet,"I love does its job well, my cat doesn't like the feel so she avoids it if she can. Ther wise a great product."
5,Really great!,"This anti-tracking pad is great. The last one that I had left litter all over the place. It didn't keep the litter in place. With this one the litter falls between the little plastic ""tangles"" and the pieces stay put there until you shake it out in the trash. I have had very little litter track outside the mat. I would definitely recommend this product!"
5,Anti-tracking carpet,Anti-tracking carpet is a success at keeping the litter from being tracked through the house after the animal uses the box. I have two cats and carpet has made a big differance in litter being tracked out of the box.
3,Not as good as I had hoped,"I was really excited about receiving this because I figured that since the litter box was such good quality, this would be much better than the mats you can buy for MUCH less money to attempt to keep litter from getting everywhere...This is very big and a gaudy color, so I went out on a limb and bought it even though I hated the appearance because my cat throws so much litter everywhere, it drives me nuts. Not only does it not slow him down at all (he literally gets that crap everywhere), because it's the crystal kind, t hurts really bad walking through the kitchen with bare feet and the litter is more noticeable. I have to sweep or use the hand vac all the time just to get the litter our of the floor so it doesn't look messy. I'm not thrilled with this product."
2,Not crazy about this item,"I bought this in hopes that the crystals from our automatic kitty litter wouldn't be all over the floor but it doesn't seem to work as expected. It retains a few crystals but majority of them are on the floor. Next time, I'll go for a different kind."
5,A must have for the automatic cat litter box,"The ScoopFree Anti-Tracking Carpet has really cut down the amount of litter left around the outside of the Scoopfree automatic litter box. We used to have litter all around the laundry room that had to be swept up daily. By using the hood and the anti tracking carpet, the problem was solved. When our cat jumps out of the litter box, the litter that sticks to her feet is now trapped in the anti tracking carpet instead of spreading all over the laundry room and eventually all over the house. It has worked beautifully for us."
5,Really traps litter! Great product,"We purchased the ScoopFree anti-tracking carpet to go with our ScoopFree litter box. We have two cats and I was tired of having litter tracked all over the floor and into other areas of the house. I have to say that it works extremely well! In fact, when I take it outside to shake out the litter, I have trouble getting all the litter to fall off.Great product! I would definitely buy it again."
3,Scoopfree carpet,Collects a lot of the litter however there is still a lot that the cats drag off the mat. Also a little pricey.
3,PRODUCT NOT AS PICTURED,LOOKS GREAT ON COMPUTER BUT WHEN ARRIVED COLORS WERE NOT AS BRILLIANT AND HAD SPOTTING AND STRANGE VARIATIONS IN COLOR AS IF ALMOST USED BUT TRULY WASNT. ALLWAYS LOOKS AS IF CAT LITTER IS ALREADY ON IT? VERY ODD AND NOT ATTRACTIVE TO THE EYE...
1,cat mate,I cannot use this item. My cat became sick. She likes to lick all kinds of things and when she licked this cat mate she got sick. I would not recommend it. I wish I could return it.
4,It works!,"My two cats track a lot of litter out of the box, and Scoop Free is rather sharp to step on. I had another mat that was supposed to cure the problem, but it did relatively little good. This one works much, much better. It doesn't catch it all, but it has greatly reduced the problem. I consider it an essential adjunct to the Scoop Free litter box."
2,Not all I thought it would be.,"I got this mat so that my cats would stop tracking the blue crystals all over the floor. The problem is that the crystals end up getting stuck in the loops over time. I've tried to vacuum it as well as shake it out and it's really hard to get those buggers free.For those that aren't aware of the design of this mat, it is constructed with carpet-like loops of plastic. While it looks good and does match the box and cover, I actually replaced it with a small swatch of regular carpet. Believe it or not, it's easier to get the crystals out of the carpet with a vacuum cleaner than it is to get them out of this mat... I am rather disappointed."
2,Could be bigger for the price...,"Bought this in early Feb 2008, it's almost 3 months later and certainly this ""carpet"" cuts down on litter tracking, but it's relatively small for the price when compared to other litter mats. And the real negative - my cats like to urinate on it instead of inside the litter box, so I've had to soak it in a bleach mix about 6 times now, and unfortunately the litter that's been tracked in doesn't come out when it's getting cleaned. Not sure this thing is going to make it another 3 months in my house."
2,No spark,"Well, this is a tale of a young woman who is forced into marriage to pay off her brother's huge debts. The heroine is painfully naive about the culpability of her dear brother and the hero is painfully dense about the heroine and women in general. Reading the story was like watching a puppet show of paper-cut outs. The plot lacked depth and the characters were two dimensional. I wanted to like the story, but I was sadly disappointed. There was just no spark or zing to draw me in. It was predictable from start to finish. Sigh."
5,Fantastic!,"Some soundtracks I hear in films sound worthy of the purchase once I leave the theater, yet when I get the cd home I think to myself ""Come on! What a waste"". Not so with this one...the music is just as moving in my car or on my Ipod as it was in the theater.The Constant Gardener was a truly amazing film, and Alberto Iglesias certainly had a challenge in matching such a diverse and gorgeous work with music that could be equally powerful. Iglesias rose to that challenge and delivers a true work of art. An added bonus in this soundtrack are two songs by Ayub Ogada. If anyone is looking for some music that's different and beautiful, he is the answer.The only weird thing on this soundtrack is that the songs don't appear in the order they did during the film. It works out however, since they flow perfectly on the cd together."
5,Alberto Iglesias does it again!,"For those who have followed the musical production of Spanish-born Alberto Iglesias, you will be surprised with his work the score he did for the film ""The Constant Gardener"". Famous for scoring the five most recent movies by Pedro Almodovar, Iglesias reinvented the style that made him famous, blending in sounds and instruments from Africa. The result is a soundtrack that ranks alongside 2005's great soundtracks, which made last year one of the most prolific ones for movie music.""The Constant Gardener"" is a solid body of music that serves as a great place from which director Fernando Meirelles (City of God) can launch the visual concepts that make this one of the best movies in recent times. Along with the work of Alberto Iglesias, you can spot the voice and strings of Ayub Ogaba contributing the the uplifting musical mix. Overall, this is a soundtrack not to be missed."
4,CD Review,The film was excellent and I liked the soundtrack. On later playing the CD. I found the music to be as good as the time I watched the film.
5,"Movie Sound track from ""The constant gardener""",Hauntingly beatiful music that goes perfectly well with the movie and the book. I listen to this sound track often.
3,it captures the spirit of the movie,"I like this soundtrack because it reminds me of the movie, which I loved. I am not sure I would appreciate it much if I hadn't seen the movie and didn't have pictures in my mind for each theme. It is redolent of Africa though and that in itself is satisfying."
3,Only track 13,"In my opinion, only track 13 is worthy of buy this CD. Track 13 is beautiful, other than that extremely depressing music...... Once again track 13 is the most beautiful adn touching music that I have ever heard!"
5,Hear this,This film must be seen and heard at the best possible venue.Iglesias' score is sensational.
3,"Two star singers, otherwise average","I was lucky to attend the prermiere at the Teatro Donizetti in Bergamo. The scheduled tenor (forgot his name) was replaced by Joseph Calleja; at that time unknown to me but a veritable sensation,a ravishingly sweet voice..Sonia Ganassi gave a magnificent interpratation as Elisabetta. Everything and everybody else was average, but still the performance was worthwhile attending because of these two singers."
5,shakespeare for dummies,"i've read a few 'no fear shakespeare's and have found this (series) to be so helpful, especially for one who is unfamiliar with shakespeare speak. definitely worth getting!"
5,Spark Notes No Fear Shakespeare Othello,"As my first introduction to Shakespeare working in a senior high school collaborative English class, this book helped me enormously with its Modern Day English interpretation on one side of the book and the Shakespearean writing on the other which follows the regular novels. This proved to be a lifesaver!"
5,Excellent Job!,"When I first heard about the criticisms of the Purpose Driven Life and thought I needed to examine them, I discovered a very hostile environment within the Christian community. I responded with anger, which was not necessarily productive. However, after being directed to Abanes book, I am now more at peace about it all. I realize that we are all struggling to find the truth. While some tear down others to find it, others become ""doers"" of the Word. I'm glad I figured out that Rick Warren and Saddleback are ""Doers"" of the Word.Excellent job condensing the concerns and answering them."
3,3 stars,"For the past couple of years, The Purpose Driven Life has been making its mark on the bestseller lists and in the lives of those who have read it. Churches across the world are engaging in forty day long campaigns using it as a guideline, and at least one miracle can be linked to it. This has brought a plethora of critics of both the book and the author. Reading this slim volume will give you insight to put to rest any qualms that might arise in your heart from hearing all the cons to the Purpose Driven Life. Mr. Warren's life and the purpose at its center are examined and revealed to be soundly grounded in Christian doctrine. If you have any doubts about Mr. Warren or his writing, then read this book, and you will be able to read the other books with complete freedom.Reviewed by Amanda Killgore, Freelance Reviewer."
2,"Readers, gather for a class action case","It's important to hear alternative views about conventional treatments. The perspectives of Dr. Lee and his co-authors, unfortunately, are frighteningly biased. I sincerely hope this book does not lead people astray. If you are not well read scientifically about breast cancer, beware! The persona of the book, the grains of truth can delude the uninformed and those who don't think critically. You may not be able to see how these authors are axe grinding. Those with breast cancer who believe and follow all that these authors say should seek each other out and stay in touch. In five to ten years, you may want to consider collectively if this book has harmed you."
4,very good,The book was what I had expected it to be and more. The book was very informative when it comes to what you should eat and not eat.
2,Reader beware #2,"My mother and father read this book and it enflamed them against the doctors who were trying to convince my mother that she needed to do something about her Stage II breast cancer. She was scared to death by what she read. Perhaps literally. While she was scared, her cancer progressed to Stage IIIC. We're not sure she's going to make it. She received three opinions regarding recommended treatment from some of the best hospitals/doctors in the U.S. Then the cancer spread to her breast bone area. She is finally following doctors orders, including chemo, and her tumors are shrinking. We pray it is not too late. I'm sure this book has some useful information, but my mother only showed me the scary bits--the things that made her wait. Too long? Who knows. Beware."
1,Reader Beware,"As the husband of a 40 year old woman with stage 1 breast cancer, I found this book to be disturbing and irresponsible in its presentation.I was hoping for clarity and factual analysis as well as recomendations based on a balanced view of where the state of treatment is today relative to breast cancer.What I found was a misuse of statistics and generalizations that can deeply wound the psyche of any women experiencing the trauma of breast cancer.An unbiased view with balanced reporting was what I was expecting. I cannot keep this book in my home nor advise anyone to purchase it."
4,It did the job,"This book took me from knowing absolutely nothing about HTML to being able to create a basic web page. It was very clear about using text and basic graphics. The CD-ROM included the code covered in the book as well as .gifs and .jpgs to practice with. After completing this book I was able to move on to more advanced HTML as well as JavaScript with a good understanding of the basics. I would recommend this book to anybody who has no prior knowledge of HTML, although I would suggest they take a little more time than a weekend to learn it."
2,Admirable job,"I do recommend reading ""HTML 4.01 Weekend Crash Course"" if you already own it. The copy I bought and read is copyright 2000. The title might be changed to something like ""HTML and related activities"" as it covers considerably more than just HTML. That seems necessary to me. It would be a problem not presenting the other topics. This book does an admirable job of covering that amount of material in the 30 sessions meant to be read during a weekend. There are spots that are a little rough. It hints of being a first edition that would benefit from editing. I would wait for the next version, as there is some dated material that is only going to become more of a problem. Having said that I benefited from having read the book after having taken web design and web programming courses. I recommend reading this book (the new version) to prepare for such courses in order to take better advantage of them."
1,terrible,"All I wanted to do was learn html code in a short peroid of time. I did not have any prior knowlege so I was looking for a beginner book. This book is terrible. Half the chapters don't even deal with html at all. There is an entire chapter on the different colors that you should use in your site. It is as if the author is trying to give you an art class. If you want to learn html code and have no prior knowlege, I recommend HTML 4 Visual Quickstart Quide by Elizabeth Castro."
2,Did not work for me.,I tried this for hot flashes but it did not do any good for me. It may work for other people
4,Excellent UML for PLE Coverage,"This book is great for the UML syntax. The author does a great job of putting together a UML profile for Product Line Engineering modeling, and has great examples on how to use it.But if you decide to read it beware that it excludes many of the Architectural practices that are found in the other resources. It does not use Attribute Driven Design, Cost-Benefit Analysis, or Architectural Tradeoff Analysis.If you get it, keep that in mind. It is only good for an artifact creation reference, not the process behind arriving at the artifacts.I would definitely recommend it for the UML profile it has and the examples the author provides."
3,HIT OR MISS,The self installing CD was a bust! After a few hours on the chatline...instructed to use Windows install and then it worked. No better than the Belcan card it replaced. Rangebooster is a joke!
2,Not Simple at All,"I learned from my own interviews with mystery shopping companies you do not need to be a certified mystery shopper to get jobs as one. No need to take the KASST test. Mystery shopping is far simpler than this PH.D. makes it seem. You don't need a PH.D. to enter mystery shopping, but this PH.D. seems to parade her PH.D. credential throughout the book. Her book is self-glorifying and covers too much where it is confusing and NOT simple. I'm not a gold or silver or purple mystery shopper, but I know enough to keep me working. Too complex, too confusing for the reader who wants to be a mystery shopper. Too vague for those wanting to open a mystery shopping company. I can't believe how poorly written this book is, too. So many typos and spelling errors I lost count. Don't be fooled by the Ph.D. and publisher name, this is poorly written and edited. Horrible. Cheaper, but you get what you pay for and I still want my money back!"
1,Overwhelming To A Newbie,The book is more like a treatise for a doctorate.It is probably suitable for college credits in Mystery Shoppingbut definitely not recommmended for a newbie. There is nothing SIMPLE about its content I found it overwhelming.
