3,Graphic SF Reader,"Pretty light, disposable comics fare, with the occasional quip. Perhaps the problem with this is that they are comics aimed at kids, or young readers, or young adult readers, or whatever, without the touch necessary to make them appeal to everybody. If that is the case, they apparently did the job, but adult readers should probably look elsewhere."
2,Disappointing,"The songs and the artists are great,but something about the interpretations and arrangements on this album left me disappointed with what ""should have been"" an exceptional collection. The best part was reading the insert!"
1,What a disappointment,"I have listened to Greg Brown for many years, and have to say he is my favorite artist. The sentiments expressed in his lyrics are truely phenominal. To hear them tortured in the alternately grating and shrill voices on this cd was an absolute letdown. I knew many of the artists represented here, and had great hopes for an awesome CD. Due to the discordant nature of the CD, I haven't even been able to listen all the way through. I do like the Karen Sovaca piece, and will make a point of listening to Ella Mae after reading the reviews posted here. One of the few redeeming features of this CD - proceeds benefit breast cancer research. One last note: Invest in Greg. You won't be disappointed."
3,Hip Hop Honeys Las Vegas,"The girls are beautiful, but the camera work is like an MTV music video... jumps around and doesn't have any continuity. Mostly herki jerki shots of girls posing for photos. The women are hot, but even when one is featured for her own piece, it just jumps around... no sense of being there with the model, which is why I loved the the original one. And the last 8 tracks are marketing for the other dvds. Should be called a""sampler"". Might be something you see at 4am on TV."
4,this could be shown on HBO,All this video has is girls in Las Vegas some are strippers. Some are music video girls. Their are some nudity but nothing hardcore about this video. Rappers are in this video too. Most of these women are black.
3,For kid's...sure! Adults...not so much.,"Hanna-Barbera made a fortune using ""limited cell technique."" The reason Scooby-Doo looks not so good compared to Walt Disney features is the number of frames devoted to each ""cell"" or picture. ""The Ugly Duckling in Tales of Elves and Dragons"" makes ample use of limited cell.But, children don't care about that stuff. ""Ugly Duckling..."" is an unusual story with simple characters. But there is nothing here that may ""harm"" children. Some adults, once they have kids, may forget they were brought up on Bugs Bunny and the Three Stooges...shorts that were loaded with violence. But, we all turned out ok...?"
5,A Stellar Phantom Recording,"There is only one weak link in this CD: the orchestrations could be better. But other that that, I have no problems with it. Ethan Freeman is phenomenal as the Phantom (much better than Crawford, IMO), and after seeing him on stage, I was delighted to find a POTO recording with him. The four songs and cast from Sunset Boulevard are a great added bonus, and for someone who's never heard any songs from Sunset Boulevard, this is a great introduction. I'd highly recommend this to anyone who's searching for a wonderful Phantom recording. I only wish that it was a complete, not highlights, recording!"
3,Not Bad...but needs a little retuning,"I want to give this 2 1/2 stars, but I'm going to be nice instead, for a first. This is a decent cast, and the symphony really does blow you away. Claire Moore is a fair Christine, but the first Angel of Music kills her when you realize she has a lisp. This new Phantom at first can't decide whether he wants to be Michael Crawford, be Colm Wilkinson, or be himself. When he finally decides, and this takes a while, he isn't too bad. Webber should get the cast back together again and re-record this, because if they get a second shot at this it might sound better. Might."
2,Still needs some work,"The KX-FLB751 on paper has all that you could want. Fax at 33.6 kbps, laser printing, scanner and copier. However, it is very noisy with lots of loud clicking while printing. Also, it does not scan in color. Functionally, it seems to be working fine after one month's use. It also has an attractive physical appearance. Just one of those devices that needed a little more tweaking before being released. Perhaps the next model will correct the above."
2,Not impressed overall,"I have mixed feelings about this machine. I bought it because I could get it cheaper than the comparable Brother model. It seems to me that this is a very nice fax machine that Panasonic tacked some other stuff on to so they could sell it as a multifunction.Printing: Slow (not 10 ppm as they claim), but sharp on plain paper. Will not print on heavy paper according to panasonic.Fax: Does everything I would expect a Fax to do.Scanning: B&W only, fine for documents and includes effective OCR software.Copy: Again, no complaints here. Good, sharp copies with a 15 sheet document feeder.I don't regret buying it but would not consider buying another panasonic unless they improve their efforts."
5,Okay this is actually more of a rant/request than a review!!!,"I heard about this book on NPR, its a very interesting book on the study of Michelangelo's art and drawings and how he hid anatomical pictures of humans in his artwork.Sounds cool, eh? Well it would be...if I could read Portugese (which I cannot) or if they translated it into English (which they have not).So basically its the best book I haven't read, so I'm sitting here basically waiting *ahems* for this to come out into english so I can read it!!!/goes back to pimsleur portuguese tapes"
4,Great Idea for easy swaping,Since my wife and I regularly swap the child seat between bikes this was an ideal purchase. It is easy to assemble and mount. The instructions could be better but you can easily figure them out.
5,Brings you back to the real meaning and feeling of Christmas,"The combination of his writings along with scripture quotes and his beautiful paintings is inspiring, comforting and a reminder of what Christmas is really about. A gentle, peaceful, heartfelt book in the midst of the commericialism we so easily get caught up with."
5,Nice Flag patch,"Used this patch on my army pack I picked up at a military surplus. It's a nice patch, worth the money!"
4,cheap and usable,"decent stitching and is good for general daily use, nothing really super special about this patch from other brands except for low price and free shipping."
1,"Good patch, bad service","Order this patch awhile back. Took too long before it arrived and when it did, it was the wrong patch. Contact the seller and didn't get a response for another week. Was told that I was to receive a return shipping label so I can exchange the wrong patch for the right one. Never got the label and never heard from the seller again. Since this is only a five dollar item, I feel I wasted enough time with this company and cut my losses. It's a shame because the patch is of good quality even though it was made in China! The 1 star rating is based on the lack of service and not on the patch itself. I recommend buying the patch, just don't buy it from this seller or company."
5,Great US Flag Patch,"Odd, I wrote this review for the Olive and black flag patch. But, the pic shows a red, white and blue flag. Amazon. Help me out here! This subdued Olive and black American Flag patch looks really sharp. But, it overreaches the Velcro on one of my tactical caps and wants to turn up a bit along the edge, Delivery was ahead of the projected date, it was well packaged. I can recommend this vendor and this product This is a good looking patch that I am proud to wear!http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004IM7NHO/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title"
1,lost,"The darn thing never showed up. I have a new cap with no patch, bummer !It looks nice on the page would have liked it on my head."
5,USA! USA! USA!,USA!Its like awesome cause...cause we don't need a reason cause we make up our own reason why we love our country so much each having there own story and up bringing.
3,"Handy, but not perfect","This book discusses difference calculus, sum calculus, and difference equations as well as discusses applications. With each chapter, there are plenty of explanations and examples. The book also has problems you can try to test your knowledge of the chapter.The problem I have with it is that not all the problems have answers to them. The explanations are great, but I want to make sure I understand it. There doesn't seem to be a pattern regarding which ones have answers in the back. You just have to try the problem, then look in the back to see if that one was answered.I would still recommend this to help reinforce what you learn in class or just to refresh your memory."
5,Serious gun for serious softer's,"I don't normally bother writing reviews, but having read the 1 star review below I felt I had to comment.There is a world of difference between a systema and a $100 AEG, so much difference they can't be compared. My PTW firing at 330 fps will out range snipers firing at 500 fps, but will spit 15 a second whereas the sniper may get 1 shot off!The PTW field strips as per the real gun, stops firing when the mag is empty, you can change the fps in about 20 seconds by changing cylinder, the gun is a beast and I like them so much I bought a second one :)If you're a serious skirmisher then I recommend these guns!"
1,Why?,"It appears that quite a few people were pleased with this gun for some reason? True, with 330 fps and a 400 round magazine it is a fairly adequate airsoft gun, but why on earth does it cost $1,200? I bought an electric airsoft AK47 that is 380fps and has a 400 round magazine for $104.95 on Amazon, so I can only wonder why this one costs so much? I noticed one review said that it is because of the authenticity of the gun, but the airsoft guns I own are all metal, and they look (and feel) real.I really hope that nobody buys this gun at this price, because honestly I can see it being worth $120.00 but I think they must have put the wrong # of 0's because it is absolutely not worth that price."
5,AMAZON'S PRICE WOW!!!!,"Systema's I have to say are great for weekend skirmishes (mil-sim) the best for (sim) if we all could afford them.You have to be 18 to purchase and play in any organized events so there are no kids anyway unless playing in their yard with $60 springers.Systema's ALWAY'S range from $900-1000 and no more, Amazon is way over priced on all high end airsoft models TM,CA,ICS all WAY over priced .$300 extra for this gun through amazon try all the airsoft retailers online and save $300.........amazing"
1,"Required, but poor quality","If I relied on this book to get me excited about teaching science, I would be waiting a long time. This text may have been required by the course I took, but it is a low quality test written in the obscure, academic way that gives textbooks bad name. It takes an interesting subject and makes it boring."
5,Cabbage Requiem,"This story has heart. As George copes with the advance of years and failing health, he reminds us that it's never too late to find love and see our dreams fulfilled. Always candid, at times humorous, Cabbage Requiem is a lesson for life."
4,Delightful,I found this story delightful reading. There is a sweetness about George that kept me reading into the next page to learn more of his character.Booklearner
3,You have to buy into the magic,"Once you do, these stories really keep your interest. They are somewhat different, and two of them definitely veer into fantasy. While the connection between the lovers in those two tales is lacking in concrete motivation, the situations pull the reader in. Moreover, there's almost a moral or something to take away from each story that lifts it above the ordinary. For example, while Allena made me feel even more domestically challenged than usual, she was a reminder that everyone has different gifts & abilities and should not be put into someone else's mold. I do wish Roberts would use names more often; I tended to forget them sometimes when she used pronouns most of the time.It's been ages since I've read Nora Roberts, but I'll be back."
3,A Little Magic,"Very predictable, as all of Roberts novels are. She is very good with description and detail. Characters are very similar from one book to another."
1,publisher problems,"Stupid publisher makes reading this book not worth the effort. (1) library Kindle version can only be read via computer. (2) content only displays using black text on white background. I love this author, but couldn't get more than a chapter or two into this book because of the formatting the publisher used. Just wasn't worth the effort to spend more time to read with uncomfortable lighting."
2,Disappointmentville/Made the Grade: A Little Magic by Nora Roberts,A Little Magic : Spellbound2 out of 5 stars. Can I just say awwwwwwwwww ...It was a cute story but not one I would ever read again ... to predictable and BORING!A Little Magic : Ever After3 out of 5 stars. I really liked this story more so then the first one! The characters were great. I loved Allena's spunk!A Little Magic : In Dreams2.5 out of 5 stars. It was ok .... not any real shockers on how I thought the ending would go ... so if your looking for a predictable romance then this is the one for you!Review By: From Me to You ... Book Reviews(read more of these reviews and a couple of teasers on my blog)
3,Not one of Robert's best,"I usually love Nora Robert's books. However, I feel that this is not one of her best efforts. The stories were on the short side, with not enought character development to feel the usual connection...as a romance, great!...as a Nora Robert's romance, so-so."
3,Somewhat Entertaining,The stories were a mixture of Irish magic and romance. Though all of the stories could have been better it is okay for a collection of short stories. Disappointing for Nora Roberts.
5,Magickal reading,These stories are wonderful if you enjoy magick with love! I wish she would write more!
3,Not So Magical Repeats,"The stories were very good when they were first printed in various books, but it would have been a lot better if there had been a notification that these stories were reprints. Since I've already read them, it makes you feel gipped that they were listed as a new book."
4,This would be a great book if the stories weren't reprints,"I liked all of the stories in the original ""Once upon..."" series but if you have already read that series than you aren't getting anything new in this book."
5,New title for same stories,"This is to address those who are complaining about the reprints and not knowing that they are reprints. I could be wrong, but I do believe that the cover says ""Includes three of her favorite Irish stories: Spellbound, Ever After and In Dreams."" So...if you've already read these titles, you should know that this book has nothing new to offer you. For those who have not read these titles, you get three books for the price of one. What more could you ask for?"
5,A little touch of heaven,"Nora Roberts can really weave a magical tale. I loved her Donovan Series and now she's added to the mystical realm of Ireland by adding three more.""Spellbound"" a man must find the end to his nightmares by traveling to Ireland and meeting the woman of his dreams""EverAfter"" takes a bumbling, woman who can't seem to finish anything to the doorstep of an artist who knows she's there just for him but tries to resist""In Dreams"" brings a young woman to the cursed world of another and it's she who can help him find his way homeBeautiful stories, every one. One question, Ms. Roberts. Could you make them longer next time?"
2,A little disappointed...,"none of the characters in the short stories really stands out. Although each stories has a magicial theme, fulfilling a curse, etc, there is no real magic between the characters."
2,Sci Fi,"I am a big NR fan, and have read 98% of her work. This is the one I liked the least. It is written in the Sci Fi style. Not my style, I only finished it because a paid good money for it. Now the public library has my copy of it, I won't be reading it again unlike the many copies of her books I have on my bookshelves."
4,Rusty Trusty,I have over 80K miles on front and rear Gas Magnums on a Dodge B150 work van. They rusted up quickly but after 7 years the brown hulks have not broken or leaked and still operate. The OEM Dodge shocks were leaking at 25K. I'm a KYB person by birth but they rust up just as fast. A Good replacement shock.
3,"Good, not for me everyday","These were a bit expensive, then again, most organic products are. While the freshness and the blend of nuts, chocolate and bananas gave it a decent flavor, I prefer chewy granola bars. These were good, just not my type of snack food for everyday use. A pack of 12 was too much for me."
5,A great treat for your dog,"I trust this product and my dogs love it. I always add a slice of the food rolls, which they love even more. I have also used the Sweet Potato and Fish & The Potato and Duck Formula's as training treats. Since I feed them the Ultra Premium every day they think they are getting very little biscuits. Of course this saves some real money and they love them."
1,On FDA Recall List,"Had to throw away as after I got and paid for it and the high shipping charge, it appreared on the dog food recall list. Sent e-mail to place purchased from but no response. So, 36 bucks went in trash!"
3,A family history of a Classical Spanish Guitar group of four,"They all play acoustic box guitars more less in the style of their patriarch; they are called the ""Royal Family of the Guitar"".One brother, Angel Romero, conducts with the San Diego orchestra who has had his individual concert career.Four part harmony allows fugues of a Bach type of high complexity and rich sound. As a music lover I could wish that they used guitars of a higher and lower tonal range. The music of a classical type that lends itself to guitar is somewhat limited so they also compose and arrange music to fittheir band style.I liked some of the music, but thought that they aren't really very open to new ideas in music?"
1,SanDisk Car Charger,It came to be broken. It is a poorly constructed knock off charger. It only cost $5 so it's not even worth sending it back which I guess they count on.
4,A good CD but diffrent many ways from the movie soundtrack,This Cd was very good execpt for a few changes they have made in many of the songs and the new songs they added. I am not quite sure why they changed the lyrics but who knows. One is when Calamity Jane says the word Damn in the middle of the song. andother one is in widy city. She says on this cd indor outdoor plumbing but on the movie soundtrack she says they ought to hair cuts cost a quarter. I enjoy all the songs very much except that the new songs don't fit in with the original song by the style. They also sound like they were written for small children. I like this cd a lot.
1,Absolutly rediculous,"I ended up getting this game for my birthday when I was 7. Now, I was pretty excited to play this since I really didn't have much for my Nintendo at the time. It was a cheap game and after playing it, I could see why.Graphics were quite awful even for 8 bit, and it is really difficult to play. I really would not recommend this for anyone unless they are REALLY bored or a mickey fan."
1,Wrong size boots,"I was so disappointed! I gave a very special person the gift they had been wanting for so long. You can not imagine the anticipation in the waiting and when it was finally opened at Christmas, they were the wrong size. The disappointment on their face was truly shadowed only by my own. I was sent a size 6 instead of the ordered size 8 that I ordered! Very, Very Disappointing!"
4,Here we go!,"Barnes & Barnes are best known for their ""hit"" song ""Fish Heads"", which is the most requested song of all time on the Dr. Demento show. After that song gained some notoriety, they got a contract to record this album. And what an album it is! It features some of the strangest songs ever recorded (plus the most twisted Beatles cover version ever). Most of these songs are in questionable taste, but I like them. The CD version adds a whopping nine bonus tracks to the original album. Fans of demented music, unite and buy this CD! Yeah!"
2,Barnes and barnes are good enogh for now,"this is not a very good cd worth buying, it is worth buying for 10 or 15 dollors but not too expensive, If you are a Weird Al Yankovic fan this is a good rare item al plays accordian in some songs and one of the first things in his work..."
2,Sugar and the T.O. Fantasy...,"I'm not exactly sure what all the hype is about Emily Pohl-Weary...Although I do think that Sugar was fairly well written - the images of Toronto made me cringe. I think the stereotypes that are played up in T.O. rags like the NOW are really played out. Doms, lesbians, protestors,and 'artists' who listen to obscure bands - blech!! I almost feel as if the author was out to capture every hot topic this city is obsessed with. These aren't people in this story, just gross caracatures of Torontonians...However, if this is the turn that Canadian fiction is taking...I guess we all have to get used to it!"
5,Oustanding Evangelist in Ian Bostridge,"Ian Bostridge is an outstanding Evangelist. Crystal clear diction. He brings more drama to it than those who sing it without ""personality"". More ""input"": not simply dispassionate narration/scene-setting for the dialogues and arias. This is no mere historian of the events, or spectator. St Matthew's excitement and involvement/commitment are palpable, without loss of the narrator's essential authority. He gives it the quality of an eye-witness account. Easy to overdo this approach - but he pulls it off with perfect balance. I bought the CD for Andreas Scholl, who is wonderful, but I have to admit that Bostridge is the star among these soloists, who are all way, way above average."
4,Serenity is a two-edge... (something),"Good things: splendid singing, glorious orchestral playing, nice CDROM... Not-so-good things: Chorus sometimes sounds a bit anemic, Herreweghe's approach is, as usual, to calm things down. There is some lack of a real ""passion"".Bottom line: Calm, serene Matthew passion. But what playing and singing!"
1,Spring cleaning program/SpellForce universe,"this program is made for the Mac and not MS Windows 7.It has never worked as it claims, it gets stuck on install wizard shell.The same has happened with a past purchase, where SpellForce Universe does not validate the product key.This makes me think twice before purchasing any future software from Amazon.com"
2,A bit goofy,"Honestly, this was a lot of alternative medicine, midwifery, and herbal healing. If you're an expert, this book made ense. If you're a novice or just looking for an alternative to regular medicine, it's going to be a bit too much. I didn't find it helpful and ended up giving it away. I felt like I had to be an expert to use it."
3,Weak construction.,The plug for this device broke off the second time I removed it from the wall. Was able to refuse the connection (hazardously) and have the unit continue to work. My best guess is that this is a very old unit; but it does work and it was not expensive.
4,A real eye opener to even a believer in numbers,"It seems that one never stops learning. I had no idea what numbers could tell us until I read Glynis' book. Now the information and formulas will be put into practice to determine who is in my space and who needs to leave it. Glynis explains the process clearly so there doesn't seem to be much confusion about how to gather information. And the results of the people that I tested it on (family and close friends) turned out to be very accurate. I recommend this book. It's not a book you can just sit and read like a novel, but one that keeps your mind active and arouses curiousity. It was very enjoyable!"
5,Basic numerology info,"""Glynis Has Your Number"" is an easy to read, easy to use book giving basic information to help the novice get the most out of what is presented. Ms. McCants uses people almost all of us are familiar with to demonstrate how the lessons in numerology might be applied. I found the book helpful in getting to understand not only myself, but also, several family members and friends who agreed to let me practice with their information. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone interested in this subject. (I've also heard Ms. McCants on the John Holland/Hay House radio program. She's really very good.)"
2,Had an open mind but..............,Extremely disappointed. At first I thought I was figuring things wrong. Did it over again......twice. It was like the polar opposite. I'm a senior citzen so after all these years know myself pretty well.
4,Numerology in prison,"I ordered the book for my son whose been in prison for 10yrs. He's 27 now. I told him it would help him keep his mind sharp with numbers/math. We're both 2 Life Paths, so of course, there was REALLY another reason I wanted him to have it. In his enviroment people are naturally drawn to him to tell him there life stories and I thought this would be a WONDERFUL way to understand them and mostly himself. Plus, I hoped that others would be curious/interested and in turn help them/everyone on a personal level. He finds it a ABSOLUTELY FASCINATING. I know it's helps him keep his sanity and has been a helpful tool."
2,Slightly disappointed,"It ia a generally good book for the do it yourself starter numerologist. Although I wonder where her information is coming from. As an esoteric student of many years I find that some of her meanings for the numbers don't have a solid background. Some of them Kabalistically don't make sense. Anyway a beginner will have fun with it, just don't believe everything is accurate."
3,Pretty much inaccurate,"While a few of her descriptions were spot-on, most of my numbers were way off, as were my husband's. I'm a Life path of 4, and he is a 3. I'm a singer. I'm a performer. I'm always seeking the spotlight.According to Glynis, I should be in business, or a teacher, and should not crave the spotlight. Both of these occupations seem incredibly unappealing me.I want to go out and conquer the world and be a star. My husband should be the great communicator, the great performer, which he isn't.It seems like our roles are reversed. He has a very analytical job, and the idea of sitting at a desk for 8 hours doing something analytical makes me want to scream and run out of the room in terror.So, while some things she said were somewhat accurate, most were off by a longshot.I would have appreciated some insight into how to go after your goals if the numbers aren't adding up, so to speak, because I know not everyone who is a 4 wants to teach, and not every 3 wants to be a performer."
3,Nothing New Here,"Same Old, Same Old. Nothing new here ... numerology does work, which is why people keep publishing books about it. But this book tells us nothing new."
4,Glynis has your numbers,"Have a new outlook about my relationships with my family, friends and people that I work with. The information in the book helped me a great deal in improving my attitude towards daily routine, thanks."
4,"Easy to read, enjoyable",This book covers phone numbers and location numbers as well. I enjoyed reading it. This is the book i would keep as reference. I would recommand and buy this book for friends.
2,a good starter.....,"Glynis provides a clear to the point descriptions to the number meanings, but I dont like her approach to Numerology. She seems to believe that its 100% accurate, and a sole reason to make or break a relationship. I find her brand of numerology kinda simplistic and would reccomend Numerology and the Divine Triangle as a more in depth accurate brand of numerology."
5,This book has cleared up so much for me,"I just love Glynis McCant's book. I have always been interested in numbers, but didn't know where to start figuring out what they meant. This book is clear and concise and has helped me understand so much and also how much numbers influence everything we do.Thanks for writing such a great book"
5,Your book has Changed my Life!!!,"I first heard Glynis McCants on Coast to Coast one night, and really got interested in her area of expertise. This book has had an influence on me meeting my soul mate. I'm a 6 Life Path and she's a 1 Life Path, and even though things didn't work out, I'll never forget her, and will always think of her fondly. We were considered a challenge in Numerology, but we had a really strong love connection. She got a copy of the book when we broke up, and now we both understand our differences.I am excited because the deeper I delve into this realm, the more I am amazed at the information I receive. Also, this helps with my self esteem. I can accept the idea and concept of being born with certain vibrations in the world. Wow, what mind blowing information! I can't thank Glynis enough for this insightful and relevent book of our generation and time.DevotedMoonfox"
3,Was a little cofused,"I love books like this, but I must say I was a little confused as to how you figure out some of the things she was refering to on how to figure out things about yourself. I really did'nt get much out of the book. Sorry Glynis you may have my number but how do I figure it out????"
5,Glynis Has Your Number: Discover What Life Has in Store for You Through the Power of Numerology,"This book is not only entertaining, but very insightful to each person and each area within their lives. I got to hear (again!) about my need in life--to inform everyone around me of what ""I see"" as the truth. Maybe now all I have to do to end this cycle is change my name which would give me another number entirely. Glynis? Does it work that way?? No matter--I'm enjoying every page and it's fun to figure out all your friends and family as well."
4,Glynis Has Your Number: Discover What Life Has in Store for You Through the Power of Numerology!,I have a read a lot of books on Numerology and Glynis several points of views I have not seen before. I enjoyed this book.
4,Interesting reading,"This book is very interesting to read. I have shared it with my friends and, so far, nearly everyone said that their numbers fit them perfectly. Nice reading and very entertaining."
5,A Nice Intro into Numerology!,"I really like the format and the historical information included. The author really breaks down this complicated information, and makes it easy to understand your numbers and anyone elses as long as you have a few key dates and names. She's funny too! I purchased this book soon after I saw her on the Dr Oz Show!"
4,Interesting book,I found that it gave much information about the use of numbers in your everyday life. I have used the charts and found them to be helpful
1,Glynis McCants - Number book,"As a person who is interested in numerology I have collected several books on the subject. I am not impressed with Ms. McCants latest book. There is nothing really new and interesting about it, as compared with my other books."
4,Glynis has your number,"This kindle book is fun and the info is pretty much right on. I would say that the info is about 80 % correct describing people, houses and the people living in the houses."
2,Kris,"This book is easy to use, however it seems a bit generalized (much like astrology). After determining all of my numbers I felt no more enlightened about myself than before."
2,Generic and trite,"I have read a number of books on numerology and such and I found this to be really uninformative and a waste of time. It touched the surface- barely of numerology. If you're looking for depth, look elsewhere!"
5,a very nice book,It is a book that i no else could find.I was very pleased to obtain that book to complete my collection.Yours sincerely
1,Complete Waste of Time and Money,"First off I am a 25 year old male that works in the infomation technology field. I don't know very much about cars, but I do what I can to maintain my truck. I was interested in this software because I figured it would give me some ideas on maintanance and would allow me to be better informed when taking my truck to a mechanic. Well... I was very dissapointed in this software to say the least. I truly believe they put more resources into the packaging than the software. Since I had already opened the package and therefore could not return the software, I tried to find anything in the program that was worthwhile. I soon realized that this junk was not only a waste of my money, but also my time. I have never written a review for anything, but I was so disgusted with this software that I felt I had to keep others from making the same mistake as I did. Honestly people, don't waste your time and money on this product. I rated it one star because I couldn't give it zero."
1,Scam...,"The previous review is right on. The packaging and the wording on it is deceptive. Furthermore, both the package and their web page indicate that the software is enhanced with photos...there is not one photo or so much as an illustration on on the entire cd. In fact when you buy a cd you assume that there is approximately 700Mb of information on it. Fact is, this program and all of its ""readme"" and help files consists of just under 9Mb of data. If you should see this program at a flea market or garage sale for a quarter...save your quarter for a gumball machine where you get something for your money."
1,waste of money,"Wish I had seen the other reviews here before I purchased this.Sure, they list 600 vehicles, but the advice is so generic, why bother.I.E. for changing the air filter on a a 2000 Caravan, they show a picture of a 70 something car and say 'see your owner's manual' Well, duh!I suppose it might be of some use to the person who would never look under the hood and barely knows the gas pedal from the brake."
4,Entertaining product,"I liked this game better than Caesar's Palace. This game offered more variety with four games, plus you'd get a random scenario every once in a while with either good or bad consequences. Someone could sell you a watch only for you to either discover its a fake or you get a lot of money for it, someone starts wooing you and you get married - either it's true love or s/he is a con artist who steals your money, and the like. You of course can say yes or no to any of these scenarios, but you never know if it's a good or bad choice later down on the road. And if you earn enough money (over 100k if I remember correctly) you get a nice bonus ending to your game. Definitely a lot of fun to play. This is a four-player game, but you yourself can play all four at one time at the blackjack table, if you like."
2,Before technology,"I originally purchased this so that my son would benefit from the less violent and graphic nature of the older superheroes, however, these videos are only comic strip slide shows. My husband and I got a kick out of it, but my 4 yr old lost interest very quickly since the only moving animation is the characters' mouths."
1,Terrible,"Obviously I knew what i was getting, but this very well may be the worst movie that has ever been produced"
2,"Horrible, Horrible Movie....But I Think Its Supposed To Be That Way","UKM is a Horrible, Horrible Movie....But I Think Its Supposed To Be That Way. I give it 2 stars because i think thats the feel they were going for. Michael Madsen is one of my favorite actors but this movie does him no justice. The acting is bad, the story is cheesy and even though its a short movie it feels like its dragging a bit. Save yourselft from 80 minutes of torture and get saw I, II or III instead."
2,Mediocre,"I didn't enjoy the CD. Maybe I got it too late, but good music is timeless. I thought it was a very trendy album, probably good in 2002."
3,SOUNDS LIKE CHICO .... ALMOST,"Well, if any of you can't think of who Christopher Lewis sounds like, here's a big hint .....DeBarge. Judge for yourself. Take a listen to Chico's ""Long Time No See"" or ""The Game"". The music, the vibe, the voice, the look and hey, even the CD cover. Maybe Chico's one of Chris' favorite artist or maybe Chris is on Chico's label which would explain the similarities. Yeah, Chris sounds good, but like they say, ""imitation is the best form of flattery""."
1,aggravation,"I bought this kit and then had to buy $40 worth of other stuff such as rubber gloves safety glasses2 quart glass bowl wooden spoons and vinegar. I went by the instruction even thou my friends who make soap said "" that's not the way we do it"" when I put the glass bowl with the lye watermix in the sink of cool water it cracked. $65 would have bought a lot of good soap all I got wasaggravation and a big mess."
3,Not the greatest but......,"Mortal Kombat 2 is the best in the series,(before MK 2011), The game play was better, the graphics were better, the sound was better. This version is better than the Sega Genesis version and the Super Nes version, but the area where it lacks compared to the arcade port is the loading time and the sound. The loading time is kinda long but not too bad, the sound misses a lot of the nostalgic classics compared to the arcade. Scorpion's ""GET OVER HERE!!"" is only present every-so-often and the fatality music is not present, and the rest is not the same as the original. The music for each stage is more along the lines of a MIDI version rather than the actual tracks themselves. If you want a better classic experience, your better off purchasing ""Midway Arcade Treasures 2"" for Playstation 2 or X-box or purchasing online the ""Mortal Kombat Arcade Kollection"" on the X-box360 or Playstation Network. Those are ""arcade perfect""."
5,THE Unofficial MK2 review,"this game is great ,it is always different, and has about as good as graphics as any fighting game gets on any console."
1,A tactless and tasteless author displays his ignorance,Rated 1 star for lack of anything lower. This scrapbook is a very poor display of scholarship and research. Many misinformed and unsubstantial claims made. Equivalent to reading a tabloid. Save your money. A definite zero.
1,Natural lack of Objectivity,"As a former Sunni Muslim, now an Isma'ili I can appreciate Mehrally feeling uncomfortable with his faith, and it would have in retrospect done him more good to have left the faith rather then hold on to be excommunicated. Ces't la vie.I would ask any potential reader to consider that; when St Augustine converted from Manichaeism to Christianity he demonstrated the same missionary zeal to his former faith that Meherally does.Mehrally is far removed from an objective writer, someone who definatly has a proverbial axe to grind; not just theologically with his former faith, but also personally.Many former Isma'ilis will agree with Mehrally, many of my friends who are former Sunnis , find it difficult, or impossible to reconcile their values with Sunni Islam, if we were to write about it, in a Book, I doubt we could ever be described as objective, let alone title our book ""Understanding Sunnism""."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is the worst religious book yet. I can't believe that any publisher would publish this book. Don't waste your time or money. In fact, run the other way, when you hear of this man. If you want to learn of this faith, there are many other books available."
1,Shame on you!,This man pretends to be a true muslim and yet contradicts himself by writing a book that would promote hatred amongst the different intrepretations of Islam...
3,iNFORMATIVE AND ENLIGHTENING,"I HAVE TOLD ALL THOSE WHO HAVE JOINED MY ISMAILI PROGRESSIVE CLUB TO PURCHASE A COPY. IT ANSWERS SO MANY QUESTIONS THAT BOTH I AND OTHERS HAVE ASKED MISSIONARIES BUT NOT RECEIVED A REPLY.PERSONALLY, I HAVE NEVER UNDERSTOOD WHY WE WORSHIP AGA KHAN. I PREFER TO INVEST MY MONEY IN MY SANDWICH BAR BUSINESS RATHER THAN HIS JAMATKHANA BUSINESSES."
3,Look to more accurate sources for a real insight,Although we live in a democracy it seems that certain people are abbusing this right. Everybody has the right to express themselves so long as the facts that are used as a basis for this expression are accurate. When reading this book please look to other more accurate texts and sources in order to gain a real insight into the faith.
1,HAS THE AUTHOR WRITTEN HIS OWN REVIEWS?,"This author does not appear to have any academic credentials. I doubt that anyone outside this guy's immediate family has ever even read this book. Save your money.Besides this one, I am sure he has probably written all these reviews on his own."
1,an insult to the proud tradition of islamic scholarship,"As a Sunni Muslim from the Middle East, I can attest to Brother Meherally's misdirected and misplaced attempts at intellectualism. He shows neither the depth of mind nor the clarity of purpose of the long and proud tradition of muslim scholarship and is clearly driven by bitterness. An insult to the intellect."
4,My first HT Receiver...,"Well the reason why I gave this product 4 Stars is because it was at first complicated to equalize the speakers. But I ended up figuring it out myself without the manual(its a guy thing) And the sound is GREAT, my subwoofer that I thought wasnt that good ended up sounding a thousand times better with this guy, than my previous unit. It hits ALL of the lows when I want to get a little urban, and nice with Rock music(my favorite). The Highs that this unit produces is great, while watching a movie it had me looking around my room because it sounded so real.But the silver color is a little hard to find matching equipment, but i'll work it out.Overall, nice job Yamaha."
3,souped-up * disco-funk * sexy-sound.,"I waited expectantly for the arrival of this CD, having searched the whole of England to no avail. Sukia are not well know in the UK but have this strange power that everyone that listens to them wants a copy of the recording........ The Supermacho remixes were by no way a disappointment. However, nothing can really touch the souped-up disco-funk sexy-sound of the original.The Dream Machine remixes on the UK version of the album had led me to expect more divine things. Seems like the remixes, though artistically sound, were a little empty in comparison.However, who was it (on a different subject....) who said 'some are better than others but they're all good'?"
4,Instructional,Possibly the best book on this subject that I have read. Emphasises the purpose and protocol of good sissy service.
4,"Review from Foreign Affairs, 1980","Lev Kopelev, a well-known Soviet dissenter who continues to publish in the West, and to live in the Soviet Union, tells the story of his early years when he was an enthusiastic supporter of Stalin's regime and was only gradually disillusioned as the discrepancy between his inculcated beliefs and the evidence before his eyes became more and more apparent."
2,Yoshi game,This game for me is a weak attempt to copy the game 'Tetris'. It just isnt as fun or challenging as i had hoped. The only plus that i see with this game is that it would be preferred over tetris by children because of the colorful graphics and cartoon look. So if you have children and are looking for a good clean kid friendly game to keep them entertained and expand their hand/eye coordination then this game might be a good choice.
4,Good game of stragity,"I liken this game on the level of strategy such as Tetris and Dr. Mario, where you need to plan ahead your moves."
4,Re-adjust your thinking about weight...,"With all of the diet/health books centered around the ""perfect weight"" and our obsession with ""thinness"", this book is a welcomed change. It takes this preoccupation with weight and turns it into a realistic, holistic approach that is much easier to swallow than a structured, round-the-clock calorie-controlled program. It is a quick read that will be one of your greatest references on weight control. If you are looking to get off the ""diet"" truck, here's your chance to re-adjust your thinking on weight control. It is easy to understand, and the results are realized. Coming from a former model who knew how many calories were in a vitamin C tablet, this new way of thinking is appreciated. Peace of mind is the result...and enjoyment of life's pleasures without guilt."
5,Refreshing,"I had to read this book twice, the second time with a pen, so that I could underline the most important facts. It is very refreshing not to have to think in terms of calories. I am trying the diet, and it is really easy to follow, unlike many other diets I have tried and believe me, I have tried them all and have gained weight in the process.Without sounding too cliched, this is more a ""way of life"""
1,Another weight loss gimmic,I ususally like Deepak Chopra but this time he really let me down. He is just another one trying to make a buck praying on people who a desperate to find a solution to rind those extra kilos.
5,Very educational,"Has really helped me listen to my body and understand (and control) cravings. A great, quick read!"
5,Very interesting,"I though Deepak Chopra gave some interesting points on weight loss, which I've been trying to incorporate into my daily life. He doesn't give an overal diet menu. It's more of a knowledge of how to eat and then you pick the foods. I'd never heard of ayurveda, but I took the test and it was eerie at how accurate it was. I've read lots of books and articles on dieting and I think anyone trying to lose weight could gain something from this, and I'm not talking pounds."
1,An actually unhelpful Chopra,"I've read a number of Deepak Chopra's books, and find his discussion of karma, dharma and related concepts in one of them so useful that I dip into it on most days. This one, though, especially the part about different body types, I found unintelligible."
3,perfect Weight,"What I expected, well written, informative, a good guide to help lose weight with ideas that are easy to follow and not taxing"
2,in a prefect world,"In a perfect world this ""diet"" might work. But in the real world no way, there isn't enough time in the day to preform all the steps."
3,dazzling fashions!,"What an eyeful! This is a great book for enjoying 60's and early 70's fashions and for training the eye to find scores in vintage clothing shops and maybe even thrift stores.The main problem with this book is that it is incorrectly billed as a collector's book ""with values,"" but the values are only half a page of general ranges for various items. Though that part is misleading, the book overall is flashy and fun and definitely worthwhile.It is also a good basic introduction to fashion terms and the histories of various styles. The San Francisco photography puts you right in the middle of the 60s, and though some of the styles are ... well ... atrocious, there are many styles that can be modified for today's wearing without having to go for the all-out retro look. Check out this book and prepare to drool."
1,Words cannot express my dissapointment.,"BE WARNED: Unlike other books in the Schiffer series (Fashionable Clothing from the Sears Catalog etc.), this one lacks the original ads, layouts and groovy models that made those books so fascinating. This has a few, granted, but unfortunately the majority of the book is filled with what looks like female residents of San Fransisco. And it's painfully obvious they're not models. Most look like rejects from a Gloria Steinhem convention.I wish I had known before buying it. A sprinkling of original ads make it somewhat interesting, but these women do absoloutely nothing to enhance the clothes. And are in no way a suitable substitute for the real thing.Maybe collectors will find this worth while, but fans of pop-kulture/60's & 70's fashions will lose their lunch."
4,Elizabeth Van Lew ... fortitude in the middle of ignorance,"Varon's ""Southern Lady, Yankee Spy"" is a wonderful blend of history and intrigue as she chronicles the life of Elizabeth Van Lew and Van Lew's heroic efforts before, during, and after the Civil War. Brave and eccentric, Van Lew helps the Union cause while surrounded by the blinding ignorance of secessionist loyalty and a dismay for the equalrights of women and African Americans.Highly recommended for those interested in the early woman's suffrage and civil rights movements. Civil War buffs and lovers of historical espionage will do well to add this work to their collections."
2,Elizabeth Van Lew,"Premise was interesting but I never felt I got to know Elizabeth Van Lew. The author had done considerable research and seemed compelled to include it all. A good editor would have been beneficial. Also, the author could have made a more personal connection by referring to her as Elizabeth rather than Van Lew so often. Think she could write a really interesting book about the van Lew's slave educated in the north who returned to the South and maybe ended up in the Jefferson Davis household. I like history and biography. This was rather boring."
2,Book review,Whenever I find time to read this book I'm sure it will be great. Elizabeth Van Lew played a large roll in the civil war.
1,Horrible!!!!,"I am a dark skin African American women, I never had acne in my life!!!! After using this product my skin became extremely irritated and now I have mild acne and burns from it!!! This was almost a month a go and I am still currently having this problem I am hoping it will eventually clear up and heal :-( don't buy this!!!! If your looking for a gentle exfoliator!The first use made my face look amazon!!! But over time just was to ruff for my skin horrible product in my opinion"
5,5 stars,"50 dollars is alot of money, espically when its for 5 applications, but my wife loves it, i even tried one and it works, i will buy it again even with the high cost"
4,Like a glove,I do love this sleeve it fits my 13inch Dell laptop like a glove. I wasnt aware it was brown though and I didn't see s descripton on the sale page. Nevertheless it's great.
4,Laptop Sleeve Review,Great sleeve for my Compaq 6910p laptop. Fits perfectly and protects my laptop in rainy Seattle. Very light weight and durable.
3,"Did not fit 17"" laptop","I liked the style and design of this sleeve but when it arrived it did not fit my 17"" HP laptop. Not even close."
2,Doesn't work for a Dell Studio 17 in,I purchased 2 of these sleeves for the Dell Studio 17 inch laptops. This sleeve will not work as it is about in inch too short. Product is very nice quaility.
3,I thought it was better,Good quality.. but my last sleeve was better.. I liked more the Incase sleeve.. Incase was more beautifull and better finished..
5,Love my laptop cover,This laptop cover is functional as well as attractive. I have received many compliments on it and the price was right!
5,Too Small,"I read all the reviews and concluded that this was the size to go for my 14"" HP Pavilion laptop. Received it today and like it very much, but there's no way it fits my laptop. The laptop hangs out at the zipper end and cannot possibly be zipped closed. I will have to order a larger sleeve (16""-17""), but will not be able to use it with my matching laptop bag. Strange how the sleeve will fit one consumer's laptop and not another's."
5,Perfect for 15 inch Macbook Pro,"I love my new sleeve. It fits perfectly over my new 15 inch Macbook Pro. At first when I read the reviews, I was concerned it might not fit, but it did! Of course, there's no room to carry a charger, but I usually slip my laptop into my backpack, so I just carry my charger in there. It's a really good price too. The pattern was not exactly what I expected, but still cute. (Its the one with dots that get smaller)"
2,does not fit 15 inch laptop,I received this sleeve in the mail today and went to put my computer in it. The computer stuck out almost a whole inch. When I sent an email requesting return service I got an automated message saying the company was closed for the week due to the Sukkot Holiday. So I won't have any service until next week. Seriously upsetting.
1,"Built NY 12"" Black Laptop Sleeve","I bought this laptop sleeve because an earlier reviewer said it was a perfect fit for Lenovo Thinkpad X61.He was wrong.The sleeve is about 2 inches too wide and does not fit properly. The ""patent pending"" hourglass shape is ugly, uncomfortable to hold, and makes the sleeve larger than necessary. The material is a dust magnet and looks speckled with dandruff-like particles all the time. Lastly, the case smells like cheap rubbery plastic as soon as you open it.If you own a Thinkpad X61, I definitely do not recommend this case."
4,Fits my ThinkPad like a glove!,"This sleeve stretches to fit my IBM ThinkPad without any wiggle room whatsoever, but it is not so tight that it puts a strain on the zipper or stitching. It fits it like a glove. If that is what you want, then this is great - it will feel like you have a custom-fit sleeve. (The dimensions of my laptop are: 12 7/8"" x 10 1/2"" x 1 1/4"" when closed). The fabric, zipper and construction all seem high-quality. The background color and zipper are a dark chocolate brown, not black (the photo labeled ""Dot No. 7 is accurate). Too bad there is not a handle or room for the power cord, that would make it a lot more useful when travelling. Even a pocket for my SecurID or a flash drive would be nice, too. Wish I would have waited a few weeks, the price went down $8 or so since I bought it in mid-June, but it was still a good deal compared to what you find in other stores."
3,"Does Not Fit 13"" Macbook","I bought this because a reviewer said it fit the 13"" macbook. It doesn't - not even close. From my $5.80 mistake, measure twice - order once! Nice sleeve; however. Dig the colors, pattern and the price."
3,Too small,"The design is pretty.But it is too small. My 14.1"" laptop could barely fit.And a thread started unraveling immediately.My wife didn't want to bother with sending it back and waiting for a new one, because we had to use it for our trip."
4,"Fits Mac Book Pro 15"" well.","I got this after carrying around my laptop loose in my backpack with my textbooks. Seems to cushion it well, and it's nice to carry around individually because the fabric doesn't slip out of my hands. It's a tight fit but does fit for my mac book pro 15""."
3,Cool but Not Exactly as Expected,"The size, shape, durability and usefulness of this product is as described...but it looks a bit different than I imagined. The surface is not as smooth as I thought it would be from the photo. Up close, the dots seem bigger and more colorful but the surface, overall, is more matte and dull. I probably would not have purchased this item if I had seen it in person first. I will probably resell it on eBay as the seller charges S&H both ways if the item is returned (~$11.00)."
4,"Built NY Laptop Sleeve 12""","Nice product, protective and light weight. Dell XPS M1210 does not fit. Dell Latitude X1 does fit."
4,Durable and made out of good material,"I've had this for a few weeks and thus far no complaints. The only thing is that I'm not sure how it will fit if/when I get an extended battery for my Lenovo X61! The material seems pretty stretchy, so I'm hoping it will still fit. Otherwise, I am happy with the product."
4,Good Deal!,I like this product although it is a little big for my 13 in. laptop. Overall it is a good buy and I would recommend it to someome who needs a computer sleeve.
5,Great laptop bag,"This laptop bag is great. It is durable and cute. I am using it for my Dell Mini. It is a 10 inch, so it fits my laptop and charger. The laptop bag is very thick and protective."
4,great for up to 14in,"This worked great with my 14in HP. The case is soft and padded and reminds me of scuba suit material. However, when I got a 15in Sony laptop, the sleeve wouldn't zip up. Technically, 15 laptops fit inside, but not well. You really have to shove it in there. I recommend this sleeve for laptops around 14 inches."
3,Acceptable,"I read this book and noticed that the contents in every chapter are very short. If you like quick overview of IIS4, this book is considering OK. I passed the exam with this book and some brain dumps material."
3,Alone not a very good guide for someone with no knowledge,"If you know the stuff very well, this will probably be ok. I used it with the Exam Prep (which had more errors than I would have liked), but I did pass with about three days of study and no real experience."
2,Good to start with,"As many other people, I have used ExamCram books preparing for my MCSE. I loved those little books (compared to others) for the information they contained. They were easy, right to the point, and the ""Microsoft way."" IIS ExamCram is not a bad book as an intoduction. This is what I came to conclude after failing my exam, which was the only one I failed. Also, you need to expect some errors, all books have some. I have pointed out many errors to the authors of the ExamCram series and they added them to the on-line Errata, which was a good but not a very convenient way to study!Anyway, a combination of MS Press Books, Trancedner and hands-on made it happen for me."
1,Not quite worthless...,"Ditto to the majority of the other reviews: this book is full of mistakes and poorly written. I've also used 5 other Exam Crams in my now completed quest for the MCSE, and this was by far the worst. Don't waste your money or time..."
1,Full of Mistakes,This is the worst Exam Cram book I've ever read! I stopped half way through. The information is just wrong--even the basic information about Windows NT not to mention IIS! In this case I'd have to reccomend the Microsoft study kit as your best ref. for the test.
1,One word: Disappointing,"After using the exam cram series successfully for 5 previous test I had no reason to doubt this final book on my MCSE journey. But this book lacked even the most elementary of facts to assist with the exam. There were many holes in the material, and a lot of information that was just plain wrong. The sample questions would contradict the chapter's text. As well as not apply to the current chapter at all. For example, not one word about specific ODBC errors was discussed in any chapter, yet my test had 4 questions presenting specific ODBC errors with a what is the problem type answer. I was completely unprepared, at least if they choose not to cover ODBC errors, they should have at least informed us that we should ""know some common ODBC errors"" so I could have prepared. The Exam Cram series are truly awesome study guides, but I wouldn't waste my money on this book. Definitely a 1 star book from an otherwise 5 star series."
3,It could have been better...,"I'm not going to bash this book because there are parts of it that really aren't bad. The content in this cram is not as good as the New Riders Fast Track IIS book, but it will give you a quick review of SOME of what's on the exam. I wouldn't recommend this book unless you have experience with IIS and just need a quick review. This book really doesn't do much more than that."
1,Skip this Cram,"I have used the Exam Cram books to help me pass 4 MCSE core exams, and I would give them all 4 stars, but the IIS4 cram is nearly useless. I would have failed the exam had it not been for other study materials. The content in the cram only covered about 45% of the material on the test, and it did a poor job explaining the 45% that it did cover."
2,Agree with everything said here,"I just completed my MCSE this last week with IIS4 as the last test. This test was a killer and this book was not much help. Unfortunately, all the other books of the market now, IMHO, don't seem to be much better for IIS4. This series is usually pretty dependable ( check out the 5 star reviews for other titles, for some reason, included on this page ), but this one is far below average."
2,Not up to Exam Cram Quality,I used the exam cram as my only source of reference for my 5 previous exams and they were great. This book is rushed and and contains quite a few factual errors. This books is the only bad apple in the lot of exam cram series for the MCSE
2,A poor performer in a stellar series,"Overall, the Exam Cram series of books is excellent. I have used them before to pass exams, and recommend them to my students as supplemental material. However, this one seems incredibly rushed. The chapters are lacking material, and some of the questions are pathetic at best. It would be nice to have an actual practice test at the end instead of just repeating the review questions from the ends of the chapter. Again, great series, but this was an anemic effort."
4,This is a good book but review Microsoft's exam guidelines!,"This book plus the Transcenders testing software is a good combination to pass. Those two with a little hands-on and you should pass this test. I got an 854 out of 1000 on the test without too much effort. DO read up on ODBC error messages (SQL) as it was heavily tested. This book does not delve into much depth on that subject. Otherwise a good buy, especially used."
3,IIS Exam Cram,"Not a bad book, but need to understand TCP/IP issues also and are not covered well enough in this book, use book and study suppliment only."
3,Could have been better,Not a bad book but it could have gone into more detail. A bit disappointing for one of the Exam Cram series.
2,Not Up To Exam Cram's Standards,"I'm one IIS Test shy of my MCSE and bought this book to begin prep for the last test. I read through it last night and it's a let-down from their other books, which were my sole-study books for the other tests.It seems very hastily written, the part that actually give info on IIS is only 2/3rds of the text and as of Mar. 2000 I was unable to find a list of errata for this ""Adaptive"" book (pub. in late '99, I believe). Maybe this book was written to pay off a gambling debt.It may help some folks, but it's no replacement for hands-on and a good reference (IIS help and microsoft.com are both free and good!)Viva Las Vegas!"
3,Exam Cram IIS 4,"This seems like a good book, but when you take the test the book is nothing like the questions asked on the test. It does not cover ODBC error messages like Microsoft. Only way that I found this out was by going out on the internet and reviewed exam on the Web. This book help me in some area but left a lot to be desired when getting ready for the exam."
2,Not as comprehensive or accurate as other exam-cram books.,Both this exam cram and the exam-prep for IIS 4.0 are poorly proofread and lacking in content. There are better resources out there. Don't waste your money.
4,Provides information in a precise and concise way,"From Aubs. The book does state that this is designed to get you through the exam but should not be your sole source of information. In general I would agree with this, if you have previously done IIS 3.0 or are an experienced NT administrator the book can get you through. However if you are a paper MCP then you will probably need more information. I am an MSCE and loaded IIS 4.0 and went through practical examples while going through the book. I had a conventional exam 55 questions and passed. I would say the book prepares you pretty well, the omission of the ODBC errors is a shame and there are some minor errors but on the whole it's well wrtten for what it claims to provide."
3,Good book to start with,"I liked this book because it has a lot of multiple choice questions and after each one, the authors explain the answer. Great information that will help you with the test, but don't depend only on it to pass it."
4,The best kept Sondheim secret...,"One of my favorites and perhaps the most underrated of Sondheim's musicals. The music and lyrics are inspirational. The story follows its characters along their bumpy path to success- backward from jaded middle aged movie producer to wide eyed ambitious youngster. It simply and profoundly illustrates the pain and beauty of following your dreams, trusting your loved ones and how one must ""burn your bridges every now and then or you'll never grow..."" A Perfect graduation gift- especially for young people interested in the entertainment business."
1,Poorly designed Door,"This door is poorly designed. When I installed it and tried to open the door, half of the panels turn and half go straigth. Does not look like picture of door. Instruction are very very poor and lack a lot of detail. I called customer service, who made me feel like they could careless about my problems and basically said the door was my problem. Don't waste your money on this door!"
1,ho-hum,WHAT HAPPENED AMANDA / DAMION ??????Not at all as good as the first two.characters went two-dimensionalI didn't find it at all in line ( or of a caliber ) withe the first two.
1,Did Hunter REALLY write this book?,"Unlike the first two ( outstanding ) books of this series, I found the characters flat and unreal, the plot thin and the action/suspense (?) almost non-existant.Sorry to say, the premium price I paid to obtain this book was money better spent elsewhere UNLESS one insists on having all three books.Better left unread than read and disappointed."
4,A nice beginning,"If you're wanting to examine exactly how LGBT issues have been affected by the media, this book is by no means an encyclopedia filled with in-depth information. If you do, however, want to start understanding -- or if you're new to media studies or [gay] studies -- then this is the book for you. It lays the information out concisely (and, from what I can tell, accurately), and it never weighs itself down by stilting its language to impress the reader. A quick, simple, yet informative read."
5,Extraordinary Insight About Gay Children,"This book gives first hand information about Same Sex Addiction behavior and offers extraordinary advice for parents of gay children. Richard Cohen is an insightful, passionate man who has personally come back from the journey as a gay man and is on a mission to offer advice and counseling to gay people and their loved ones about the healing process. This is a life changer for many who can learn from a real life experience of someone who has fought the good fight and tells about it."
5,What the press won't tell you,"Great book!!! I have two friends that were totally set free/healed by reading Richard Cohen's earlier work. This book puts it all together and tells you what the mainstream press ignores/supresses... and, of course, what the homosexual community hates to hear."
1,Richard Cohen's book is Awful and he is a quack,"Richard Cohen is a bizarre individual who is deeply discredited. He was expelled for life from the American Counseling Association in 2002 for multiple ethics violations. If you want to screw up your kid and cause him or her significant psychological damage, read this book.Cohen pretends to be an expert, although what he preaches is rejected by every medical and mental health organization in America, including the American Medical Association, The American Psychological Association and American Psychiatric Association. His book is nothing more than stereotypes disguised as science. Indeed, he calls himself a ""reorientation coach"" because Cohen has no real credentials.Instead of writing books, I suggest Cohen get some help to accept himself as a gay man. Check out his appearances on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart and CNN if you want a good chuckle."
4,Gotta Love The Uncle Dave Macon,"My wife and I had been eyeing this boxset for a few years now and she finally broke down and got it for me this past holiday season. It's a nice mix of country, blues, gospel, cajun/zydeco, tejano and native American. Overall, the box set is excellent. I don't think there is a bad tune on there, but I do feel it felt short on gospel, folk, cajun, zydeco, tejano and native American styles. There's only about 6 or 7 tracks for each of those styles where an entire 16-19 track disc is dedicated to both country and blues. The set should have been 6 discs instead or it should have been limited to just country and blues. Likewise, I felt it strange that an American Roots boxset included no jazz, for jazz is the only true first American born music, which is based on the blues of course. It's a great collection though and I enjoy listening to it every time. The long wait was worth it. I highly recommend it."
5,"Paula, your music is my Lovelight","Like everyone else I have been waiting for this album. Paula went through her ups and downs in the off years. She had a child and had her heart broken. The joy and pain is sprinkled throughout this album. This is by far the best Paula Cole album ever released. Paula's love of jazz which was seen sparingly on past albums is the main force behind ""Courage"".from the inside jacket:""That anyone is holding this album in their hands, reading these words, is a small miracle....I didn't want to be in the business anymore. I was too broken-hearted about it, investigating University enrollment, or considering the life of a hermit...Through the music, I have found myself again.""Well, Paula, thank YOU for returning to the business and blessing my ears with this jewel of an album."
3,Not the same Paula,"Paula Cole is happy in this album. I want to be happy that she is but, for me, I seek out music of lost, bitter soles. The type of sole that Paula once was but no longer is. It seems that she has gone through a profound change.I don't think I can properly review this album -- it is just so unexpected. The mood is pleasant and she still has a wonderful voice. But gone is the angst and the questions that comes from it.If you have never heard Paula Cole, this is probably a good place to start. If you loved her old work, then be prepared for something completely different."
2,Not her best work,I am a fan of her previous work but this did not live up to her reputation. The songs were slow and boring. Not enough energy or freshness.
2,Not as Firely as her first two Cd's,"After getting 'This Fire' many years agoI must have played it a dozen times with-in the firstweek of getting it. I then got 'Harbinger'which again was very enjoyable. Her last two CD's'Amen & Courage' don't hold up to the same tough, angry,intense FIRE that the first two CD's Hold."
2,The Long Wait for Less,"Musically, this album isn't too bad, carrying the listener along with the slinky, jazzy undertones. Lyrically, stylistically, I felt Paula's effort wasn't enough to justify the long wait for something new from her. This branching out is stunted and dying."
5,New Heights for PC,"I wasn't so sure Paula Cole would be ever be able to top ""This Fire."" But she does it definitively with ""Courage."" She retains her trademark sound- her voice rides the surf of the adventurous bass, drum, and rhythm parts with ease and dexterity- she could make you believe that she is still the ""Saturn Girl"" if she cared to. But this time around, she's a bit more wizened- simultaneously chastened by the prospect of self sustaining hope while letting go where there may be very little left. ""In Our Dreams"" in particular is, by turns, haunting & hypnotic- if you are attuned to it, the personal becomes the universal- which is what great art is supposed to do.A truly wonderful, sublime album."
5,PATTY DUKE CAN STILL ACT BIG TIME!,"Not sure about Melissa Gilbert. Had a hard time imaging William Shatner as a ""Grandpa"", but GOD, last portion of movie with Melissa Gilbert and Patty Duke was almost as electrifying as Patty Duke and Anne B. in A Miracle Worker. I really enjoyed this movie."
4,Songs of faith and devotion,"I never heard of this guy when I bought this CD. Knew nothing about the music except that it was filed in the Country section. I had a few dollars left on a gift certificate at the local music store. Cover art was kind of cool so I thought what the heck and bought it. Although it was priced at $$$$, it has received significantly more 'carousel time' than the other CDs I purchased that day at full price.Easy to like, easy to listen to and it won't insult your intelligence. I wouldn't call him a ""Christian recording artist"" but Wilkin's faith in God shines through on virtually every track. His soulful voice really does resemble Dobie Gray's, and the music is rootsy/folksy with a fair amount of twang. I especially like the tracks Genevieve and Some Men Fall. The music sounds a lot like the roots/folk band Tandy.My only complaint is that after repeated listenings a sense of sameness pervades...in other words some of the songs sound quite similar to each other."
2,It's kinda... bad,"Well, the book isn't spiral so after a while of using it, all the papers fly out. The page isn't flat, either- it's really bumpy, plus, if you use too much watercolor, it still get's curled up- isn't that what watercolor paper SHOULDN'T do?"
5,Still the best!,"This book has been around a long time (both hardcover and paperback), but is still the best overview of the craft of pysanky. It is balanced, comprehensive, and very well illustrated. And it is *extremely* practical. My only caution: the book is published by a supplier (Ukrainian Gift Shop), and the ""dye tricks"" in the book only work with *their* dyes! Still, the book is outstanding, and one of the best values for pysanky artists and fans!"
3,Buy the full regulator..,Did not fit stock 02 Sierra 1500 ext cab as amazon suggested.. It is the wrong gear for the original part in the regulator. Better off buying the full regulator setup for a few bucks more. Amazon took return no problem... Unusable so no idea how the motor functions.. 1 star to amazon for telling me it would fit..
1,Save your money and many hours of your life.,"This book makes people want to quit undergraduate chemical engineering at my school. I'd rather do slave work in a mineshaft than to try to read this dry and abstruse book again! What a waste of people's lives when professors force their students to try to learn from this book. The subject matter itself should be challenging part and not the presentation. You know, I think when authors spent too many years using the concepts, they feel like what is obvious to them is good enough for any novice to understand. I felt like I had to translate heiroglyphics and learn fluid dynamics at the same time. Of course, I don't mean to be so depressing and leave anyone hanging. A good book like Fundamentals of Heat&Mass Transfer should be like a day at disneyland compared to this book. Schaum's outlines can be quite nice too. Good luck!"
3,Great Software,"This software is great for beginner or experienced stargazer.You can select your location and year, thereby going back or forward in time. Shows stars with and without drawings, so you can learn what they look like in the sky."
5,Nice product...while it worked,"I bought this for my son who wants to be an astronaut. It's easy to set up and use. Unfortunately, the program started malfunctioning shortly after we bought it. It may be an issue with the fact that my OS is Vista but we don't use this anymore. But it was fun while it worked."
4,Lovely Bedtime Story,"Harry, a toy elephant can't get to sleep. His friends, Lulu, a teddy bear, and Ted, a lamb go to sleep right away. Harry tries lots of things to get to sleep. He reads a bedtime story, hangs up his clothes, runs in place, touches his toes, and jumps up and down. Still he can not get to sleep. Then his friends help him. They all look out the window at the night sky, then snuggle up together, and finally, Harry falls fast asleep. This is a delightful bedtime story that will appeal to young children. Lewis is a skilled colored pencil artist, and offers beautiful , soft colored pencil illustrations that make use of soothing, pastel colors. Lewis' illustrations work well with the text."
4,New stuff is better,This is a good cd but I know him personally and his new stuff is going to make this look like small potatoes.
2,Painfully blonde music :(,"Totally disorganized, totally distorted, totally mind-numbing. The lead-off track by Hilary Duff is the worst sort of over-filtered pop now available from the ""majors"". The only picture that came to my mind listening to the song was a bunch of six year old girls hopping around on a sugar high. The rest of the CD is either re-tread material or worse.Save your money and buy the Avril CD with it."
4,Lizzie McGuire has her own soundtrack? GREAT!,"LIZZIE McGUIRE ORIGINAL SOUNDTRACK1. I Can't Wait - Hilary Duff (3:11)A WOW song! 9/102. Why Can't We Be Friends - Smash Mouth (4:00)Kind of annoying. 7/103. All I Can Do - Jump5 (3:13)An okay song. 8/104. Us Against the World - Play (3:42)I WOULD HAVE TO SAY THAT THIS IS MY FAVORITE SONG! 10/10=A+=100%5. Irresistible - Jessica Simpson (3:11)I don't like this song and I don't like her. 6/106. ABC - Jackson 5 (2:58)A great oldies song. 9/107. Everybody Wants Ya - S Club 7 (3:07)Okay. 8/108.

1,Full Of Bubblegum Fluff,"Its cds like these that really aggravate me. Unless your cd collection consists solely of Dream street, play, aaron carter, I dont see why you would want this cd. And personally, I find nothing spectacular about Hilary Duffs singing ability."
2,Lizzie Soundtrack,"This CD is OK, I wouldn't buy it myself though, I got it for free from my cousin. I am a big Lizzie fan, but she doesn't have a talented voice, in my opinion. I mean, she can sing, but it's very average, her song, I mean, on that standard even I could be a popstar. But the CD is OK, the rap song is pathetic if you ask me, and the theme song kind of grates on my nerves. I think the CD is a bit young for me (13) and it is kind of too sugary, not good if you are in a bad mood. It would be good for 4-9 year olds, but I'll stick to watching Lizzie's show and not buying her CD's."
1,OMG LIKE TOTALITY I REALLY WANT THIS DUMB CD,I WILL TALK LIKE YOU AIR HEADED FEMALES LIKE I RATHER CHEW LIKE BROKEN LIKE GLASS BEFORE I GET THIS STUBID CD YEA MAN TOTALITY FOR SURE TOTALITY
1,IT IS BAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD,dont buy this pop garbage it is to comerchalized and Is corupting out youth any way dont buy your kids this because none of this music is true music it is all pot producted and hsoud be destroyed
5,(The Lizzie McGuire Television Soundtrack),"This CD has 12 tracks on it with the first song that Hilary Duff sings ""I Can't Wait."" If you like pop and rock this CD is for you. This CD has more pop so if you really like pop music this is for you. Also if you have heard the Lizzie McGuire Movie soundtrack and have liked it you would probably like this CD as well. The last track has the theme song to Lizzie McGuire TV show. If you like music like from Brittany Spears, or Jessica Simpsons or Play or N'Sync or Backstreet Boys you would probably like this CD."
2,Not Good Enough,"There are some cute songs in this soundtrack, and Hilary Duff's song is not one of them. Hilary must be glad there is technology that can help her sound so mcuh better than she actually is. I can't believe she is going to be coming out with a CD of that nonsense. Overall though, I wouldn't get this CD. Don't waste your money."
4,Great for Lizzie Fans....,When I secretly placed this CD in the player at my daughters eigth birthday party all the girls screamed with in seconds of hearing the opening notes. They all loved it. You can not go wrong with this CD if you have a Lizzie MacGuire fan in your house.This is definetly mixed with the younger crowd in mind but the Smash Mouth and Jackson 5 songs plus one or two other songs make it bearable for parents too.
4,Hilary,"This Hilary Duff is getting out of control, but I have to give out some props for this soundtrack. It is orignal and not a fake way of making music. Good job."
4,Cute CD for 8 year olds.,"I'm sorry I just can't say Hilary has talent. I mean she acts really well.She just doesn't sing that well. I really like the song Walk Me Home by Mandy Moore. I think over-all this cd is cute for people like 8 years old and younger. If you took away all the the electronics warping Hilary's voice I bet it'd sound like a moaning cow. I'm sorry to be rude, but that's really what I feel. :)"
1,If this is what the music industry has come to...shoot me,"If you have little 5 year old siblings/kids/whatever, buy this for them. They will enjoy singing to the predictable and unoriginal lyrics. I dislike the show for its cheesiness at times, but it kinda grows on you after you had a hard day. When will this madness end??! First 'Dreamstreet' (gee...I wonder who they copied from), then the clones Play and No Secret, now this?!?!? Thank god for singers like Michelle Branch or the music industry would just fall on its face within 2 years of this madness."
3,Heh,"...In my honest opinion, the song ""I Can't Wait"" is great. I love it. I'd buy the CD, yes. Though if Hillary was really gonna come out with an album she should have used her real voice and not some computer modified voice or whatever. Don't get me wrong. I'm a fan of Hillary and her TV show, but she should stick to acting and not singing. I do recommend the CD for fans and non-fans. It's a great soundtrack, but I give it 3 stars for Hillarys lack of using her own voice to sing."
5,Why are you just standing there? BUY IT!,"This CD is AWESOME! ... Hillary Duff is AMAZING (and her show rocks too)! My favorite song has got to be I Can't Wait. It is another 2 minutes from what they show on television. The rest of the songs are great, except the rap one. Others may like it, I'm just not a rap fan."
2,I should have checked it out from the library,"Instead of paying good money for this book. I will be donating my copy to my local library so others won't have to make the same mistake. This was a not funny and not even that interesting collection of travel stories. I've read funnier and better stories in the various travel magazines I subscribe to. It was supposed to be about hotel disasters but one story was just about being stuck with an annoying travel companion (yawn!) and another was about being hit with bad weather during the trip, not the hotel's fault surely? Don't waste your money."
4,Good tips for a beginner,"This book give the novice writer a clear step-by-step plan for writing a romantic novel. The author provides examples of workable plot developments, troubleshooting techniques, a lengthy bibliography, lists of romantic publishers,and even a glossary. This book was recommended to me by an experienced author and I think it was well worth the purchase price (I purchased the book from the 'used' offerings.)"
4,It's been said before...,"M. Scott Peck has delivered this message before in his bestselling book ""The Road Less Traveled"". He opens it with a section called ""Problems and Pain"" and starts ""Life is difficult"". He goes on to to say, get over it and take control, get on with it... What Hayes has done is intentionally or unintentionally copied that message with similar results. People are tired of trying to keep up with the instant gratification world of the media and want to know it's OK to be dissastified and everyone else is basically also. It's not a bad message to reiterate, because it's more real than the ""reality"" promoted by advertisers."
3,Good Basic Information,"It provides a good explanation of ACT, very readable. The only downside-I was hoping for more of the actual exercises to use with my patients."
4,Very good!,It's a very interesting reading to anyone that wants start studying the ACT or plans to know more about this relative new science!
3,Too much ordering arranging ranking and comparing!,"For me, not so good, but maybe great for someone else. Looked forward to working it, having had good results with other workbooks. Have been successful with therapy, journaling, and meditation, but looking for an extra ""bump"" on some stuck issues. Useful first exercise for me and good chapter on language and the human mind. From there, the work becomes tedious and cumbersome with lists and logging, ordering, arranging, rating, and evaluating. For someone like myself who is seeking more inquiry into one's internal landscape, patterns and reactions, I think a Focusing workbook would be more helpful. I'll skim through the rest, take what I can, and work the exercises that seem worthwhile."
5,Stellar resource for those willing to do the work,"I purchased this book with no prior knowledge of either it or its methodology. What a stroke of luck. After 9 months of slow but diligent completion of the exercises contained within, my life has changed dramatically for the better. Dr. Hayes does not lie, however, when he states that the concepts are subtle and difficult to grasp, and that the work is hard. But the work does pay off. It offers not only relief from constant mental self-attack, but also an alternative way of looking out from ""self"" to the rest of the world. Thanks to the tools provided in this book, I am beginning to experience true knowledge of self and life as shaped by conscious direction, rather than as a string of reactive experiences lived by default due to prior conditioning."
2,Powerful ideas ripped off from Claire Weekes,"To the author's credit, these are very powerful ideas that, as I know first hand, can have a VERY powerful psychological healing effect.To his discredit, he totally ripped them off from a book called Hope and Help for Your Nerves by Claire Weekes. Now he's the founder of a ""new school"" of therapy. Please. He should grow a pair and credit his source.Five stars for the fact that the ideas are good. Minus three for intellectual grand larceny."
3,Provably false,"' It is more like, ""If you aren't willing to have it, you will."" In practical terms, this means that for example, that if you aren't willing to feel anxiety as as a feeling , you will feel more anxiety ,(p. 30)' ""I suppose that means if I were more willing to be anxious, I might not be so anxious. I hate being anxious, so I guess I will give it a try. I'll try to be willing to feel my anxiety so I won't be anxious."" With that, the thought trap slap down around you, because if you are willing to be anxious only in order to become less anxious, then you are not really willing to be anxious, and you will become even more anxious! '(p. 44)This is patently false. The exposure therapy works exactly like this - the client is willing to be anxious in order to become less anxious ... and he DOES become less anxious."
3,Interesting but obscure and confusing,"I decided to pick up this book after reading the chapter on having a thought versus buying a thought with a group in an anxiety program that I was attending. The milk exercise in that chapter illustrated that words can lose their meaning. I thought this was an interesting concept and I wanted to look into what else the book had to offer. So I did. However, when I got to the second chapter, on Why Language Creates Suffering, I found the concepts very difficult to grasp. The discussion on relational networks was very confusing to me. There were other concepts in the book that were rather difficult as well. So considering that, I would say that overall, this book could be useful if you're working with a therapist trained in a Cognitive approach to psychotherapy but I doubt it would be useful if you were working alone unless you're a quick learner and can grasp abstract concepts very easily."
4,Great!,"Very interesting. This book was recommended by a therapist friend of mine. I've found it relevant, interesting, helpful and thought -provoking so far. I'd recommend it."
4,very well crafted,the book is about dealing with what matters the most and is also the most important to you and your being. the kind of book that makes you change your outlook and also the growth from within your soul and inner foundation. this book just wants progess and develop a way to be further along and a better self being as time goes by. i truly got what this book was about i believe and I enjoyed the way things were broken down and stated.
4,Get out of your mind and into your life,"This is a workbook. Since I was expecting a discussion and got a workbook, I was not as happy as I could have been. As a workbook it is good."
2,"Buy ""Mindfulness and Acceptance Workbook"" instead","Hayes may have 'originated' ACT, but his workbook is difficult and confusing. ""The Mindfulness and Acceptance Workbook for Anxiety"" covers the same material but is much better organized and easier to understand."
3,UNFAIR,"This new approach is interesting, from my perspective as a therapist. But the editorial review is quite misleading about cognitive-behavioral therapy. The editorial implies that CBT is difficult and unsuccessful. In fact, there is strong evidence for the effectiveness of CBT (unlike the approach presented in the book, which has preliminary evidence). As a therapist, I have seen it work wonders in some patients and be helpful for many more patients. For one type of anxiety, in which people are troubled by their excessive worries about real life problems or potential problems, CBT is not especially effective, and Acceptance based therapy may be more helpful. For depression and many types of anxiety, CBT is a treatment of choice."
1,Attention: This is a WORKBOOK,"I was very disappointed when I received this book. I wanted more information on ACT, not a workbook. It should state in the title of the book that it is a workbook. It does state it on the top front cover that is almost impossible to see online. If you look at the picture, the small band at the top of the book states, ""A New Harbinger Self-help Workbook."" It is so clear when you get the book, but online, it is almost impossible to see. It should state this in the top discription, which it doesn't. Very disappointed. Will probably be returning this book to get an informational book and not a workbook."
3,How?,"Although I think this book can be helpful to many people, I don't understand how these authors can get away with pawning these concepts off as their own ""new, evidenced based "" ideas? They are so clearly recycled from concepts that have been known, written about, and practiced by clinicians for the past 50 years now. It's pretty absurd to see them get away with this."
3,Great concepts but could be presented better,I love the concepts but find the descriptions a bit repetitive and painful. I wish he would use clinical examples. To see my detailed thoughts on this book please read my blog on it at:http://drbremer.blogspot.com/2009/05/book-review-get-out-of-your-mind-into.html
2,The refill is below average,The refill is below average and does not work the same way as the original waterman ink. will not recommend
3,Older one is better.,"This is the second yoshi game that came out and it is for three different systems,nes,snes,and the game boy. This is when the nes stopped making games. I liked the older one better than this one. They r both the same type of games like tetris and Dr. mario. In this one u r yoshi and u try to collect the cookies falling down and some r worth more then others. It is more fun on the game boy because u can play multiplayer on it up to four. It is fun but like the old one it gets boring after a while. I like the older one better."
2,BRING BACK THE ORIGINAL BROADWAY CAST ALBUM,"To start off with, I am an avid Anthony Newly fan and was really sadden by his death. I did get to see the original Broadway show. Unfortunatly, this new version does not match the original. Newlys way of putting over a song is missed. The songs seem to be sung much slower so the performers can sing the songs. It was Newlys show and when you listen to the original cast album, you can tell the difference. Lets hope they will reissue the origianl cast album again. It is an important Broadway musical and should be back on cd for the people who did not get a chance to get it when it was available. I'm glad I was one of the lucky ones. Did we really need another recording of Stop The World? I don't think so."
2,An insult to the great Anthony Newley,OK so it is the only full version of the show currently available on cd. But sorry Mike Holloway is no Anthony Newley! For the ultimate appreciation of the show record the original Newley tracks and edit the music only tracks from this version. Isn't it about time someone released the broadway cast on cd? Paul Goodhead - President of Anthony Newley Appreciation Society.
1,"A LITTLE RESPECT FOR THE LATE ANTHONY NEWLEY, PLEASE!","Now that Anthony Newley has passed away, it would be a good gesture of respect to reissue the absolutely perfect Original Cast Album he recorded with Anna Quayle. In an era where the removal of Pamela Anderson's implants gets more attention than the passing of this talented composer and performer, we must stand up and DEMAND that such as Newley are never forgotten."
1,The CD is boring.,"I can't understand why the original cast recording is not on CD. This latest version is listless, boring and a very poor representation of the exciting and novel Newley cast on Broadway. Whoever is listening...please put the original cast recording with Anthony Newley on CD..I can't even find the LP recording anymore."
2,"NOT THE ORIGINAL VERSION, BUT BETTER THAN NOTHING","IF ANYONE IS LOOKING FOR THE ORIGINAL BWAY RECORDING ON CD,PLEASE CONTACT ME AND I WILL MAKE A COPY FOR YOU. YOU CAN REACH ME AT brubin@bigplanet.com"
2,Not the Original Broadway Cast (as suggested by headline),Sorry to say that this release does not measure up to the 10/12/1988 Polydor 820 261 distributed by UNI and now out of print. I must heartily agree with Mr. Dunn (above). Bring back the Original Broadway cast!
1,I have the orginal Broadway version on CD,"I know that the orginal Broadway version was released on CD because I have it. I was trying to buy another copy of it, for the person that I went to see it with. I know there was a movie version of the show which was awful. There was also and A&E version that was on TV a few years ago. What happened to that version both on video and on CD?"
2,Lacks the zip of the original with Anthony Newly,"This new production of Stop the World... is good but lacks the energy of the original cast recording, apparently only available on LP. And the LP is hard to find! As an alternative to the ""real"" thing, it is still a worthwhile CD for your collection of musical theater soundtracks."
2,Disappointing,"I purchased this document in the hope of reading an academic account of the relationship between Shakespeare and his beloved Metamorphoses. I was disappointed to find that the document was a brief book review. Had I read the fine print on the Amazon page, I would have learned this, but I was gullible enough to assume that a detail of that importance would be publicized.The article itself is well written and presumably offers an intelligent review of the book in question. I doubt, however, that this two-page document is worth the $5.95 that I paid for it."
4,NOT AS GOOD AS THE OFF-BROADWAY VERSION,"IT WAS NICE TO SEE A NEW VERSION OF THIS COMPILATION COME OUT SOME TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AFTER THE OFF-BROADWAY VERSION FIRST MADE ITS MARK. THE LONDON CAST HAS PASSION BUT DOES NOT QUITE HAVE THE TALENT OF THE ORIGINAL CAST. LIZ GREENWAY HAS THE RIGHT LOOK, BUT HER VOICE LACKS THE POWER AND THE RICHNESS OF ELLIE STONE'S. HOWEVER, THE MUSICAL ACCOMPANIMENT IN THE NEW VERSION IS AS GOOD AS, OR BETTER THAN, THAT FROM THE ORIGINAL. I AM GLAD TO HAVE THIS LONDON RECORDING, BUT I REGRET THAT THE ORIGINAL VERSION IS NOT AVAILABLE IN CD OR CASSETTE. SOMEONE COULD MAKE A BUNDLE IF THEY COULD FIND A WAY TO REINTRODUCE THE OFF-BROADWAY VERSION."
1,Revival not up to Snuff.,"Anyone who has ever heard the original cast album produced by BMI with Elly Stone, Mort Shuman, Shawn Elliott, and Alice Whitfield, will never be able to listen to this terrible remake. Gone is the mystic, haunting quality beauty of the original. Sound quality is harsh and the perforances are dry and emotionless.I don't know if the original album is available anymore, but if you can find it, I wouldn't settle for this one. It does not do justice to Brel's music."
2,A Disappointment,"If you have heard the LP records of the original cast, this performance simply does not match up. The music is powerful and the songs are especially evocative, but the singers, particularly the female singers, simply do not have the vocal intensity to match the music. And the instrumental accompaniment is limited as well. All in all, it is a pallid evocation of the original."
1,Not up to snuff,I have the old LP orginal cast album made back in the '60 or '70 which is wonderful. This new cast CD doesn't hold a candle to it. Hopefully they will reissue the old recording on CD one of these days. I certainly hope so. I don't like this on at all.Tim
1,BUYER BEWARE,"I truly wanted to like this recording, as I know and love the songs. This version, sad to say, pales in comparison to the motion picture soundtrack; in fact, this doesn't even include the spectacular tune ""Song for Old Lovers"" at all. The orchestrations are lovely and played with skill, for the most part. But I find the vocals distract from Brehl's music: Cahill, when he belts it, has a typically strident show voice; Egan has a wide vibrato and puts too modern a spin on her interpretations for my taste; Greenaway has terrible intonation, sounds like she has a head cold, and when SHE belts it, it's downright ugly. Pendred steals the show as the best musically, but one out of four doesn't make for a very good balance. All in all, a terrible disappointment but if you must have this recording, BUY IT ON AMAZON.COM as it lists elsewere on the 'net for twice as much and it definitely AIN'T WORTH IT!"
4,NY Cast Infinetly Superior to the London Company,"By mistake I ordered the London Cast Recording of Jacques Brel is Alive and Well and Living in Paris. While adequately performed, the London Cast maintains a ""stiff upper lip"" quality to their interpretations that lose the driven heartbreaking passion that so epitomized the New York production. Mort Schuman, Shawn Elliot and especially Ellie Stone capture Brel's little ""playlets"" of song so the listener understands and empathises with the performer living and suffering the emotions with them."
1,Not even close to the original album.,"The lyrics, of course, are exciting and moving, the orchestra is weak, the performers are not even close to being able to express the exictement and emotion of the songs. Liz Greenaway cannot carry a tune, her renditions are flat and awful to hear. Same for Alison Egan. Stuart Pendred comes close to Mort Shumans delivery in Mathilde and Amsterdam, etc. I found the album very hard to listen thru to the end. Not even close to the original. VERY DISAPPOINTING."
2,Good if you haven't heard the original...,"I was given this CD as a present from someone who listened to and loved the original Jacques Brel, and isn't too fond of this one. I personally like this one, but I have nothing to compare it to. If you haven't heard the original, this is a good recording to listen to, simply because the songs themselves are so great and at least two of the singers can actually sing. Meanwhile, I'd like to find the original and find out what everyone's raving about."
2,I can help people obtain the original recording,"I too feel that this recording does not compare with the original. I would like to help others, as well as myself, obtain the original CD. In order to do that I will need the UPC Code from the CD. I have the LP, but it was issued before the day of UPC Barcodes. If any of you have the Barcode information please forward it to me at oceanview5@aol.com"
1,Sounds like Brel died in London!,I have the original cast recording from '66 on vinyl...even with all the scratches it's easier to listen to than this. The off-Bway show ran forever...this one would have been lucky to make it a week.
5,This book has EVERYTHING,"This book is EXCELLENT.. it has 99.9% of everything and anything- from getting pregnant in the first place all the way to birth and beyond... it gives a weekly planner with what is going on with your body and another weekly planner with what is going on with the baby, gives different birthing options, warnings, rolls of partners and gives them an understanding of their part and also has a section if you are a single mom and how to find support needed- which I thought was nice... things to watch for and enjoy, breast feeding, and just really explains everything simply! To be honest, I love the layout of this book and how material is presented.. (I absolutely hated what to expect when expecting...) A very well thoughtout book and material."
5,MUST HAVE!,"I love this book. I am a first time Mom and bought this before we started ""trying."" It has great pictures and explains things without using a whole lot of medical jargon. I would highly recommend this to any first time mom!"
5,Best Book For Pregnant Women!,"This has to be the best book out there, the pictures alone make it worth having, but there is so much more to this book...almost every book I've tried so far had nothing but drawings (this one has incredible full color pics of your growing baby)...it's full of practical advice even as far as lists of meal ideas, remedies for most common problems like heartburn, right down to an entire chapter on diaper changing, care of the umbilical cord etc. I also liked the way this book focused on how to do the right things during your pregnancy, rather than the way most of the other books focus on everything that may or may not go wrong until you become scared and end up with nightmares! Definately buy this book, you won't be disappointed. And I just have to mention those amazing pictures once more!!"
5,Predicting Pregnancy,"I LOVED the Pregnancy Bible while I was pregnant. During my 2am ""wake up"" I would nibble on an apple and read about my growing embryo. I looked forward to seeing what growing changes my baby had for the upcoming week. I enjoyed reading this book and had a better understanding of what my body was going through, how I should be eating, etc.This book makes a great gift for first time parents!"
5,Great all around pregnancy book,Bought this after learning my wife was pregnant with our first. Has answers & suggestions to all the issues we've come across and more. I'd definitely recommend this book to a new pregnant couple.
5,A must have for new parents,"This book has all you need to know about pregnancy and taking care of your newborn. I especially like how they did not leave out the role of the father, there is a whole chapter dedicated to fathers along with information for him in other chapters.This is the one and only pregnancy book I had to buy, it covers almost everything any other book on pregnancy covers."
3,"Info is good, photos are little much","The information in the book is very useful. However, a few of the photographs are a little too much for my conservative tastes. For example, do we really need actual photographs of how to make love when we are pregnant, couldn't we just have a written description? So, like I said, the information is good, but it is not a book I want my children to stumble upon. In the end, I wish I would have chosen another book that also had updated info but without the actual photographs."
2,Not that good,"I purchased this book at the recommendation of a coworker. I returned it the next day. The book has some rather graphic pictures and is not all that informative. I found What to ""Expect When You're Expecting"" to be the best pregnancy related book. Even my fiance liked reading it."
2,"A very good book, but you can find better information sources online","This is a very good book, but you can find better information sources online. Even your hospital and family health center would provide you with better information with multimedia, video and even more pictures. Don't rush to buy this book if you are first time mom or first time dad!"
5,Great Primer!,"As an expecting father, I needed some guidance (beyond the obvious) about my wife's pregnancy and about fetal development. I tried a famous book in this subject, but was utterly disappointed by its lack of organization and depth. After browsing through several pregnancy books at my local bookstore, me and my wife decided to get this great book.1. The graphics and illustrations are superb.2. The organization is very intuitive.3. The information is explained in a coherent manner.4. The authors are not condescending or patronizing at all.5. The index is excellent when trying to find a specific topic.I highly recommend this book to both fathers- and mothers-to-be."
1,Very uncomfortable,"The straps are very uncomfortable. The handle for carrying the bag like a briefcase is not on top of the bag, but goes between the two shoulder straps instead. So when you put the bag on your shoulder, that strap hits the back of your neck. Very uncomfortable.Note also that the picture of the bag open (which shows the handle on top) is of a different bag."
3,expectations,Runway may not boast of big stars but never once do you miss any. It delivers more than it was expected out of it and is an earnest effort. Go in with zero expectations and chances are Runway won't disappoint you. In fact it will definitely surprise you.
4,The Production of Houses a book beyond its time,"FIRST published in 1985 it is the fourth volume of a series. It tells of a Mexican project, and like its pre-published volumes, discusses a philosophy as well as management and construction issues. While costs may have dated over the past 27 years it remains relevant to any younger Architect interested in the genuine serch for function and beauty."
5,Is That Your Final Answer?,"Oh, this is amazing! A lot of good stuff from John Carpenter. I know the questions are SOOO hard that your brain is about to short-circuit! It should be a lot of fun!"
2,Worked OK for little over a year,It worked great for a year a so for the use as suggested. Cleaning was not easy as the other user described. Now some blades have deformed and lots of paper is getting stuck in them. Time to replace it. Will not recommend it - not durable. Company website [...] is not reachable as well :(
3,"Steady, affordable, dissappointing","I've been using this shredder for a couple years since my wife found it on sale. Buy it only if you have moderate, intermittent needs. Pros: Ease of operation; reverse/off/auto (forward) switch. Cons: It doesn't stay a 6 sheet shredder for long -- the blades on mine have dulled to the point that it only handles about 3-4 pages at a time, max. It also overheats and stops working if used too intensely. It's not easy to clean, which affects performance because you can get jammed spots that essentially become permanent. In my case this happened after the 1 yr warranty period. You should also expect to make a mess when you pull the shredder unit off the basket in order to dump the basket -- dozens of hanging semi-shredded pieces from the unit will fall out, etc."
5,Great product,"This product replaces a 26 year old cuisinart food prep that really just got handed down to the daughter who was moving into her first apartment. I like the redesigned food chute and the much nicer way the top slides and locks onto the bowl. This is smaller than my first cuisinart but I am only prepping for two most of the time these days, so I am happier to deal with the smaller size. It does a very nice job of chopping, slicing and shredding and is not too loud about doing those things. But, time will tell as to whether it and it's bowl can go the distance!"
2,"Nice processor, but poor bowl design","We are new food processor users, so must admit to a certain amount of ignorance using this product for the first time. It does have a lot of nice features. The slicer feature is a hoot to use.Problem is, when we tried to set up for puree the first time, we got the handle towards the back. It has to be towards the front and will only run that way. I am giving two stars because in my humble opinion, this is poor design. The bowl to motor interface should be fool proof: There should only be one way to put the handle on. Even though I never used a food processor before (or even seen one before today), I can say that this is an aggrivation easily prevented with proper design. The instruction book is very unclear about this."
3,Great! but two things...,"Everything I wished for except being too hard to clean, and having only two speeds (on/off)"
4,7 cup Quisinart food processor.,"I searched many websites for the best quality and price for a 7 cup stainless steel food processor. Not finding a stainless steel one that size, I purchased Cuisinart's white one. Great quality and function."
5,Buy this and you won't regret,"I bought this from amazon after my cheap Black & Decker FP1400 Quick N' Easy Plus Food Processor became unusable just after a year (shattered bowl and eventual motor failure). I was a little hesitant to spend more than $100 for a FP, but I am happy I did. My wife compliments me whenever she uses it. It's very quiet, very well-built, and very powerful. You can't go wrong with the 3 yr overall/10 yr motor warranty.Update (September 2011): Still going strong after 7 years!"
1,The bowl locking mechanism?,"I used the Prep 7 once. It was wonderful. The second time I used it the tiny white plastic lever that serves as the locking mechanism between the bowl and cover broke. It seems unusually vulnerable. I have used a Cuisinart CFP 9 for 30 years--loved it and never had a problem. I bought a replacement bowl assembly through e-bay (since to buy it new costs almost as much as the Prep 7) and it arrived with the same tiny white lever broken. I'd appreciate any suggestions, but it's hard to recommend the Prep 7. Great motor. Great everything. But useless if bowl and cover don't lock."
5,Easy to use,Everything fits together like a charm. It has a powerful motor and minces onions much faster than my old one. Have to be careful next time.
5,Quick and easy time-saver!,You can't beat this food processor for making cooking and prep work quicker and easier. Processer just about anything within seconds and clean-up is simple. Being dishwasher safe is a big plus!
4,Meets all expectations,"I bought this unit to replace an old, inexpensive food processor. I have been impressed with the powerful and reasonably quiet motor and the quality of the parts. I like the fact that the cord stows away on the underside of the unit. I also like the fact that the base of the unit is smooth with no corners or cracks to get gunked up. The unit and all the parts seem quite sturdy and hopefully will last a long time. The accessory items such as the spatual are not that nice, I'm glad I didn't pay extra for them."
3,not deep enough for liquids,"This is a great little food processor. it chops up garlic and onions and grinds coffee better than anything i've seen but every year we grow tomatoes and can sauces made from them. the stem port in the center of the bowl is only about an inch high. that's it. you can only do an inch worth of liquid in this thing at a time. i'm keeping it because i've never seen a food processor work so well with the dry items, but i'll probably get something else to do the huge batches of tomatoes i have to do every year."
5,Awesome,"Ultimate kitchen tool for literally anything. You will be hard pressed to find a more handing tool, from shredding, slicing, to making doughs dressings and sauces. I'm not a chef, but this tool makes me look like one."
5,Wow!,"Every time I use my Cuisinart, I say ""I am so happy I got this one!"" Slices uniformly, dices so quickly."
5,Cuisinart DLC-2007N Prep 7 7-cup Food Processor from third party seller.,I love this unit. I previously had 3 and 4 cup processors and they were inadequate for some jobs. This is just the right size for my needs and I am very pleased with my purchase.
4,Handy & easy to clean,"My first processor....I find it's very easy to clean (altho just done salads so far). It's big heavy & takes up alot of my counter space, but what doesn't if you live in an apartment! Looking forward to doing more with this in creating more meals."
3,Not bad...,"I had previously bought a Playboy hardcover and loved it... 50 years of playboy is a large coffee table book whereas this was much smaller and ofcourse only covered the 50's, 60's and 70's...Overall for the price this wasn't a bad book but I'd stick to the pricier Playboy publications..."
1,"Attention Developers, I'm left handed.","You must use your stylus to control the racing in this game. As a result, your right hand must constantly hit the screen with the stylus. I predict that in more demanding level/races you have to move real fast. I cannot do this with my right hand accurately.The one redeeming quality of the game are the upgrades and interaction with the racer/dragon."
4,Dragon Booster,"I gave this DS game to my son's 6yr friend, the report I got back is that the game is unreal, wonderful, best present he got this year for Xmas. We are not able to purchase this game in Australia so he is the envy of all his friends"
4,Enjoyable Game,"As a long time Dragon Booster fan, I was excited to see the Dragon Booster game, even more so for the DS. The game lives up to the fast-paced excitement of dragon racing within the TV series. Though it is more challenging as you progress through the games, it's entertaining at the same time. I mean, you can really push other dragons/riders off the track! Or, be pushed off yourself! I really enjoy being able to play through with different dragons. The gear is awesome, as you get to customize it to each dragon, so you get to choose what you want on who. Overall, I've found no real problems with the game, and I feel it offers an acceptable challenge. Any Dragon Booster fan is sure to love this game."
4,was wanting more...,"was hoping for then just a racing game with the crew from Penn Stables. for what it is, it was a good deal, in more ways then one."
1,crappy game,"This game SUCKS because it got lousy graphics,you can,t stop your dragon from stopping not to mention it got terrible gameplay,so all of you amazon buyers,""DO NOT BUY THIS GAME""."
4,A Worthy Read,"It's clear that the book is self-published due to the seeming lack of editing and the copied photocopies of pictures. The title makes it sound as if the writer is talking about the occupation right after the war ended instead of being in the early to mid 1950s. But in spite of that, the diary is interesting, informative, and an enjoyable read."
1,Things to Consider,"If you use any homebrew at all, this thing is going to be so slow half of your applications won't work properly because the drive has to actually spin since it uses a compact flash card instead of a standard memory stick. Even if you don't it accesses your Photos, Music, and Video folders slower than memory sticks, if that doesn't bother you and the sheer bulkyness of this product doesn't bother you then it is perfect for you."
3,Still waiting for something better,"I purchased this book with the hope that it could be used as a painting guide for my artwork and military miniatures. My interest is in the common Russian soldier in the field - infantry, artillery and cavalry. Unfortunately, typical of most Osprey publications, a lot of the plates are devoted to officers, as well as small, obscure and even bizarre units. Missing from both the plates and the accompanying narrative is an account of the evolution of uniforms, arms and equipment from 1914-1917. I cannot even find what markings were used to distinguish NCO's, let alone colors for things like canteens and shoulder badges. I would have also appreciated some information about what life was like in the ranks, for example, food, shelter, discipline, promotion, etc. That said, this book does offer a good starting point for anyone who shares my interest in the common Russian soldier in the late imperial era."
3,Good for the price,"The keyboard bag is a great bargain and looks like it will endure travel. Padding is almost non-existent. I solved that by slipping in a sheet of bubble wrap from a prior shipment. I wish the 2 fabric belts they use as a handle had a padded grip to hold the belts together, a minor deal. The front storage pockets are good for music but I wish it had a smaller one for cord/adapter or accessories. Also wish it had a velcro belt on the interior to keep the keyboard in place because I can never seem to find the exact size case for my keys."
3,Quality case for the price but doesn't offer much protection for your gear,"If you're looking for a case to carry your keyboard, wires, adapters, pedals etc around in, then this is a great bag at a great price. But if you're looking for something to keep them safe; something that you can put in a trunk with other gear and not worry about it, or something you can fly with then you should go with a hard case instead. This doesn't have any real padding, so keep that in mind."
2,"Sad, sad, sad","Ok. I haven't bought this CD, but I've listened to samples and, well, as my title says..........I would suggest buying the actual movie soundtrack instead. I've seen that movie so many times, it unbelievable. And it sounds good."
2,I strongly disagree buy Heartsongs:Live from Home,"This cd may contain some of Dolly's hits but it is far from being the definitive collection of her career. There are better and cheaper greatest hits compilations available.For my money, Heartsongs: Live from Home is my candidate for best overview of her career. Recorded live at Dollywood, it ranges from country pop to bluegrass. You get Dolly talking between songs and telling stories that relate to the songs. She does cover tunes and original material which give a depth and clarity to Dolly's public personality and her deep devotion to faith and family. The sound quality is exceptional for a live recording. It may not contain her biggest hits but it does represent Dolly at her zenith."
3,"Nice design, but durability issues","We bought two of the Faulkner lounge chairs, through Amazon, two of the other chairs and an ottoman for our pool deck in 2007. They look great and we love the lines, the metal, the soft color of the cushions. The cushions should be brought in whenever it rains, or left out whenever they are wet and need to dry thoroughly.In this imperfect world, with lots of summer thunder showers, ours got left out often, and have deteriorated.That may be our fault. More troubling is that on the arms of the lounges there appears to be some manufacturing defect that causes them to get misshapen, as though water is inside and causing corrosion. I'm not sure that is a viable theory as these are aluminum, but something is causing nearly every arm to change and the paint is coming off as a result.So now I'm at the point of deciding to replace the cushions or start over with some more durable outdoor furniture."
3,Strathwood Falkner Chaise Lounge Review,"We ordered four of these chaise lounges for our pool. They are very nice, but the fabric gets dirty very fast. Also, the buttons on the cushons come off very easily. You'll have to take the cushons inside if it rains, because they get wet and stay wet.Overall, nice chairs, very sturdy frames, but so-so cushons. Replacement cushons are VERY expensive.Update. We have had them for a few years now, and the cushons are totally nasty, even though we take them inside. The metal frames of the chairs are actually splitting apart. These look great when you first get them, but they go downhill fast."
2,"Love Them, BUT","I bought the two-seater lounge, two chairs with ottomans, the dining table, 4 armless dining chairs and 2 dining chairs with arms. I love all of it and it looks great but there is one major problem. After 2 seasons the finish on the arms of several pieces is bubbling up and cracking off, exposing the aluminum underneath. We have used the pieces in a normal fashion - no excessive wear and tear that should cause this type of problem. I'm hoping the remaining pieces will hold up OK. The other downside to this furniture is the pillow are a bit difficult to keep clean, and because the table is slatted, things fall through a lot. I'm thinking of getting a plexiglass top for it. But other than the problem with the finish, I really love the furniture."
5,Talk about Hitting the Nail on The Head...,"This book is a must have for all newbies to ActiveX Control Development. Tom Armstrong shows you how to develop a robust ActiveX Control using the most efficient routes.. He leads you past all of the troublespots and guides you with the best methods. I developed my first ActiveX Control within 4 days after walking through all of the great samples he had in his book.. If asked, I would recommend this book to anyone. It's a must have."
2,"""Unauthorized"" means...","For those of you who don't live on the level of Emma-fandom that I do, a newsflash. This woman will record her life story when she is good and ready. This biography is merely a patchwork of what might be true and what probably isn't. What we are ment to know of Emma Thompson, we will know the truth of, and what we aren't to know are things no person needs to know of another. If you are an Emma fan, however, you'll appreciate the nice cover shot and picture section inside. Take these, put the whole of the text aside for bathroom reading, and wait about thirty years until the real story comes out."
4,definitely worth buying,"This is worth buying for the emma thompson fan. It gives a very good account of her family background, her early childhood, her marriage to Kenneth Branagh, and her rise to stardom. I enjoyed reading it. Kari Guy"
4,some review,"real publishing year is 1991, in 1989 it was ready to printAlmost every page has color picture of inside view or drawing of the construction plan.As the building itself was the Russian tzar residence, this guide over it's thousand of rooms has some extra value"
1,could have been great if......,"I saw this band play live a ton of times. Back in the day they were by far the best band in Cleveland. That was back when Chris Maneri was on drums and Tim Haliday was on bass. Those two made the band what they were. Alx is an amazing performer and songwriter, but with out Chris and Tim he never captured the same feeling again. A lot of these songs were played and recorded with the old band and were much, much better. ""Goldfish"" for one was one of the most amazing songs I'd ever heard before. The version on Icon is stripped down and boring. If you want to hear some excellent stuff from Cows in the Graveyard try your best to find thier first cassette intitled ""Godzwiper"" It's an amazing album and a thousand times better than Icon. I continue to respect and admire Alx, but the good times were a long time ago."
3,"Politically, much too slanted.","The women in this book are believable, but the men running for office are not. Ms. Mortman has managed to make the Democrats pure and good, and the Republicans evil and horrible. The book would have been much better if she had been a bit more balanced in her approach to the affiliations of her characters. The relationships were not based on anything in particular, and the issues weren't very believable for a presidential campaign. She passed up many opportunities to make the plot take hold of the reader. She is a good writer, but this was a disappointment."
1,Mortman fans will be totally disappointed with this one!!!!,"I LOVE Doris Mortman's books...each and every one of them....especially TRUE COLORS...but what happened here???? Yes, she went with a new publisher but did she trade in her wonderful writing talent as well???? I cannot believe that she wrote this book...what a waste of time, talent and paper....I was so eager to get her book and was soooooooooo horribly upset and disappointed...could find not one redeeming factor....I hope that this will not be the way of future Doris Mortman books....sad. She was one of my very favorite authors....I bet I bought at least a dozen copies in hardbound and double in paperback of TRUE COLORS to give as gifts to friends...I loved that book so much...you could ""see"" the paintings in that book...please give us Doris Mortman back and not this imposter who ""wrote"" this one!!!!"
5,Easy to Use Lessons for Writing Poetry,"I have used this book with whole-class instruction and individual work. Either way, the lessons are so easy to understand that students walk away with well-thought out poems. Each lesson offers steps for prewriting and examples of finished poems. Students have fun with the various options to write about!"
3,The book is always better than the music score,"The opera score for Candide was dissapointing. The tracks were not in order of the story. The first parts are in the middle. The Overature is at, or near the end, This was true of both copies, the Original) cast production, as well as the much newer Broadway version. Luckey me, who reads the story severa times a year (for at least 30 years) had no problem understandnig what wasgoing on, but I was not pleased with the incongruity of the placement of the songs."
2,Disappointed,"I bought this toaster oven to match the stainless appliances in my kitchen--not the best criteria to use! First, the temperature is significantly hotter than indicated on the temp. dial. I consistently set it 50 degrees cooler than a recipe calls for. Secondly, you have to move the rack to a different position each time you want to go from baking to toasting or vice-versa. I didn't think this was a big deal at first either, but it gets to be a pain--and it wasn't necessary with my Black & Decker. I also did not like the size. This thing takes up a lot of counter space. I would probably put up with that aspect if I was getting good performance but that is not the case."
2,Cuisinart Toaster Oven TOB-30BC,"I never even used it because it was too small!! The interior demensions are wrong. It is only 12""wide, 10""deep, and 5 1/2"" tall. I can't believe it can hold a 5lb. chicken like it states. I did not like it."
2,Almost burned down the house,"We bought this model at Best Buy after reading the reviews on Amazon. I like cuisinart equipment and felt that it would be worth the $99 price we were paying. We took it home and pushed the toast button. The unit would not turn off. Even in the correct settings it would never turn off. After trying toasting again the unit beeped as it should. We took the toast out. 20 minutes later our smoke detector went off and we realized the unit never turned off. After it cooled it made a quick return to Best buy. I am not sure if this is typical of the units but it is very disturbing. I am very hesitant to buy cuisinart again. My big problem is this, we were replacing a black and decker unit that had its toast button broke after 4 months. It seems that there are no other units that we trust. We also cannot stand the newer units with the ticking timers. Is there not a toaster oven out there that is realiable?"
1,defective and dangerous,"Our unit is attractive looking enough, but after only about three months in use it no longer turns itself off after toasting, even if it beeps and the light goes off. This is highly dangerous. The cop-out in the instructions telling you that you have to plug and unplug the unit each time you use it is absurd. I would expect a $100 item in 2004 to have switches and controls that work properly- just like my beloved DeLonghi toaster oven which worked fine for 15 years."
4,Awesome oven/but likes to beep!!,This toaster oven cooks and toasts perfectly. I cooked brownies in this oven & it took 15 minutes less (electricity saver). Toasts evenly on both sides if rack positioned in the middle. Best toasted bagels!! I cook/bake alot & will be using this oven more than my big oven. Only reason I did not give it the 5 STARS is that is beeps for no reason/when not in use & has woken me in the middle of the night!! Enjoy but UNPLUG after use. It has nice pans and was packaged very securely to avoid damage.
2,Watch out for the bake mode!!!,"Had the unit only a few days. Everything seems nice, but there's no preheat option, and the bake mode uses the upper element. I went and got another thinking that the first was defective, but they both do the same thing. The top elements are bright glowing red, and the bottom are just a tiny bit red. So you open the door to insert food, it cools off, and the top element burns your food. Completely unacceptable. And it's not just while the unit is getting warmed up; The bottom elements never got more than a tiny bit red, while the tops were glowing, this even after it was on for an hour. Now I have two returns, and some more shopping to do... :-("
2,Good while it lasted,We bought this model because of the reputation of Cuisinart and because it went well in our remodeled kitchen. It worked very well for about 18 months and then just died. I will be very hesitant to but anything Cuisinart in the future.
2,Only lasted two years....,"I purchased this oven in December of 2003. I really liked it and it always worked well for me. Unfortunately, after two years it died...I turned it on one day to ""Bake"" and smoke started coming out of the top of the unit. Unfortunately, the warranty had just expired!! I don't think it was designed very well. I didn't like having all of the settings (Bake, Broil, Toast) on one dial. Based on all of the reviews I have been reading lately on this particular model, I would not recommend it."
1,Cuisinart Toaster Oven TOB-30BC,"Purchased this unit in December 2003. It worked well until about one week ago, when my wife attempted to bake fish. Shortly after setting the proper baking cycle, my wife noticed a strong chemical odor eminating from the oven. Upon examination, the heat was at maximum and had melted the plastic front door. Regardless of the setting, the temperature is so extreme as to create a definite safety hazard. This oven probably should be recalled."
2,Loved this oven till it Broke.,"I ignored all of the reviews that said that their oven start switch stopped working shortly after buying, and purchased this beautiful oven. It was larger than I thought it would be, but toasted perfectly. A few weeks after we got it the start button froze and I had to unplug the oven in order to turn it off. Once plugged back in it worked great for another 2 months. Today I pushed the start button and the toaster does not turn on!!! I can still use the oven, but my kids use it as a toaster most of the time. I will contact company today and let you all know how they handle this. I would stay away. This is too common of a problem."
1,Not good,"I did try to research before I bought this - obviously I missed these reviews... because it would have been good warning that this is an expensive yet bad toaster oven. Our Black and Decker lasted 10 years and then died. I wanted something nicer, so chose the Cusinart. It burns everything. I set it 25 degrees lower and still I have problems. It also makes a loud POP sound - as if the metal is bending or something. I used to do some minor cooking in the toaster oven so I wouldn't have to heat the large oven - but I can't do that since it has basically destroyed anything I've cooked in it. This was definitely a bad purchase."
2,just tossed mine,"It's taken me a couple years, but I've finally decided to toss this thing. It always cooked too hot and often burned things. It's worked consistently, though, but between the burning and the body becoming an eyesore (rust), I've dumped it."
3,"too hot, otherwise good","This toaster works well and looks great. I've had mine over 2 years now and haven't had it ""go up in smoke"" or stop working like the other reviewers experienced. My main problem s that there's no real way to lightly toast anything. The lightest setting produces a medium toast and the medium setting produces a very dark toast. We've never set it anywhere beyond medium, and if we want it light, we set it on the lightest setting and take it out before it's done."
2,Watch out for electrical problems,"The rheostat on one of controls makes a noise and then smokes. There is obviously a fire hazard with my model. It's to bad because it's a nice model, but the controls are cheap. Make sure you send it your warranty card and keep your receipt."
1,Bake stopped working. Stays hot on toast,This thing is a weird beast. I bought it on Amazon about 18 months ago. At the time it was the #1 seller. The bake stopped working. Sometimes after toasting the oven stays hot for some reason. I'll have to check my warranty or just chuck it and get a different brand this time around. I noticed the current #1 seller is a cusinart. With so many other brands out there I'd go with something else (kitchen aid/krups/de longhi)
1,BUYER BEWARE!,"this product gets 1 start solely for its looks, otherwise i'm very dissapointed. it suddenly stopped working after only a few months of light use (toasting and such)! the reason i spent more and went with the Cuisinart name, rather than the inexpensive brands (Black and Decker etc.), was because i thought it would last! like another reviewer said, they should stick to making food processors. i still need a toaster oven since they're absolutely necessary in the kitchen. i don't even know if it's worth the trouble to contact Cuisinart. amazon can't help you after 30 days."
1,Made in China junk,"I bought one of these in 2003. After two years of use, it started electrical arcing and sparking inside. Bought the same model in 2005 to replace it. After 2.5 years of use, the mode selector switch broke internally. After all the quality and poison product recalls from China, I had my suspicions about where this Cuisinart was made. Looked on the back panel, sure enough, ""Made in China"". Junk. I will say, however, that when it works, it's great. Just don't leave it running unattended."
3,"Makes good toast, but watch where you put it","I ordered this toaster to replace an older DeLonghi that just wouldn't stay on any more. The Cuisinart looks great, makes pretty good toast, and the on-off button feature is great, but I had a problem pretty quickly. The toaster beeps when the toast is ready--not the problem--and sometimes also beeps for no special reason. Whenever I turn on my disposal, the vibration in the counter sets off a high-pitched noise from the toaster that only stops if you unplug the toaster. Then the same noise started to happen randomly (no vibration necessary). I called Cuisinart (no easy feat to get a live human there), and the recommendation: unplug the unit. No offer to repair or replace. I guess I'll just keep it unplugged when I'm not using it, but I'm sure I won't be buying any more Cuisinart products."
2,Broken knob,"After searching far and wide for anything to replace my Black and Decker toaster oven we were initially pleased to have found the Cuisinart TOB-30BC. After 4 months of use we have found the toaster oven to be quite dependable. However, one of the knobs broke off during normal operation and we were astonished to see that it was held on by a piece of cheap plastic.We got in touch with Cuisinart about the problem and they agreed to repair/replace our toaster oven. The only kicker is that we have to ship the defective toaster to Arizona - at our expense! To make matters worse we were required to enclose a check for [$$] to pay for THEIR shipping costs back to us.As we do not see the benefits of spending an additional [$$]for the ""Free warranty work"" increasing the cost of the toaster by 40%, we will likely opt to limp along with this one for a while longer. Maybe after all 3 knobs have broken off we will ""pay"" for the ""free warranty work""!!"
4,It's not perfect.,"I have one and only one complain about this oven. It takes quite a while to toast one slice of bread at ""light"" setting. Otherwise, this is worth the money. The quality and finish is exceptional. You can tell it's solidly built. The interior is easy to clean. Specially the pull out tray, to clean crumbs. Cooks evenly and temperature setting is accurate. It may cost more that the ""average"" toaster oven, but certainly worth the money."
4,Great little Toaster oven,"I bought this one to replace my little Black and Decker Toaster Oven. I wanted something a little larger then the B&D; models.This item was a Gold Box value which I never thought I would use but hey, you never know what you find in there!.... It matches the rest of my appliances since it's Chrome and Black and is a nice size.I like to reheat food, make dinners for my toddler and bake smaller items like rolls and etc, than to fire up the big oven.So far it fits the job for having it now for months.I like the removable crumb tray on the bottom. You just pull it out and sponge it off. With the other toaster ovens, you have to hold the whole unit over the trash can and smack the sides a few times to get all the droppings out. Not an easy task to do. So this crumb tray was a great selling feature."
3,almost there,Does a good job toasting things but the electronics have gone south. Once a week or so it will start beeping for no reason and I have to unplug it to make it stop. Also the food tray is not attached to the door so it makes it hard to get your baggle / toast out when it is done. I am going to donate it and get a better toaster.
2,Classic disappointment,"This toaster oven broiler is very attractive and when it was new it worked better than I could have anticipated. Excellent toast, great results on baking and pretty good broiling. After about a year, however, the broiling became weak, then the toasting became uneven and then the function selector just failed.I thought I'd get at least three years out of this. Too bad. At least I'm not alone."
5,Great Oven,"After I had two new Krups toaster ovens die in a period of several months (the heating elements gave out), I decided to switch to this Cuisinart a year and a half ago. I am extremely happy with this purchase; the oven is roomy enough to take care of most of my (modest) baking needs, and it heats up quickly. In fact, I rarely use the large oven on my range, because the Cuisinart is sufficient, and uses considerably less energy.As with most toaster ovens, the top surface can become very hot, and all toaster ovens should be unplugged when not in use, so reasonable precautions should be taken when using this appliance."
1,Burns in baking mode!!!,"Top heating element of oven will burn items when cycling on to maintain oven temperature while in bake mode. May be an OK toaster, but is highly unsatisfactory as an ""oven"". Also disappointed that there is no shield over lower heating element to disfuse heat. Sorry to say that this is the first time I have been unhappy with a Cuisinart product!!"
1,not worth $,"I bought this toaster oven after reading all the good reviews on this site. After about a month, one of the heating bars broke and the only way I can cook with it is if I place the bread at the back of the tray. I tried to contact Cusinart (which was a project itself) and they said I had to mail it to them with $10 for return postage. I think I'll skip that and put it in the trash."
2,"Pretty appliance, but it burned my cookies!","I really wanted this toaster to work well. It is just the right size, it's an attractive appliance, and the controls are laid out well. However, after it burned several batches of my Toll House cut-and-bake cookies. I put an oven thermometer in the oven and set the thermostat to 350 degrees. Ah ha, after preheat time the thermometer was reading 400 degrees - it's cooking 50 degrees too hot. I repeated the test several times and on several settings just to verify the results. I e-mailed Cuisinart support (and they were very responsive) and they said that it must be a defective unit. So, I sent it back to Amazon.com and ordered another one. To my surprise and disappointment, it had the same problem. It cooked 50 degrees to hot. So, I returned that unit as well and bought another brand. The other brand isn't as pretty and the controls aren't laid out as well, but it doesn't burn my cookies!"
2,Went Up In Smoke After 2 1/2 Years,"I got a lot of use out of this toaster oven for the first 2 1/2 years. It toasts fairly evenly, the broiler works well, and the controls are easy.Unfortunately, a problem started about 3 weeks ago. The toast setting would click off after just a few seconds, making it impossible to toast anything. Today I turned on the oven, and the wiring inside the controls started to smoke. I unplugged it immediately and now have to replace the whole unit.I would not recommend this oven. Internal wiring should not burn under normal use, especially after just a few years."
5,^.^NO DA!,"The sixth book was REALY good. The plot thickens alot in this book,(i realy thought it was almost over!).Chichiri and Tasuki are awesome!! This book was also kinda sad. You think everythings finaly going right for the poor suzaku warriors when you find out that one of them is a traitor!*gasp!* which one is he? I won't spoil it!! just read the book and find out!~NO DA!! ^o^"
3,nice bag,Nice bag but dimensions were way off on size. I had the smaller size and when I put them up next to each other they were almost the same size. There was a little imperfection on the top of the bag but this was for my son and he didn't mind since he needed for trip at christmas.
5,Awesome,Im not really 13 im actually 16 but this way was more convinent.This is a must have Cd. I did this for my high school play and the music is great.
5,Profound,"I've read at least four books by Vernon Howard and this one was most helpful to me in learning what I had to do at that point in my life to begin making the necessary changes to become the person I always knew I could be. I recommend it to anyone who is nearing the point of saying, ""I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore!""This book doesn't advocate anger or protest; rather, honest self-examination--which is all that the true seeker really needs to break through."
3,Better than many of the recent Self development/new age/spirituality book,This is quite a good book but sad that it seems to me a huge number of good ideas but jumbled up without any order or progressive route. Some ideas are unfortunately wrong but generally a big improvement on many books of today. The fact that some people have been attending his weekly classes for twenty five years and still are concerns me as he suggests the way out is instant. His idea of simply watching the thoughts instead of being lost in them is not simple or for me ever been possible. So I rate this three stars as I say because I think he has a better understanding in some areas than most of the recent teachers but his explanations are not very clear at all.
4,Virtua Cop Sega Saturn game,This game is so intence I would compare it to Golden eye for the N64! the grphics are amazing it is one of the best action games for the Sega Saturn if you like Golden eye you'll love Virtua cop!
4,Hard,This is a VERY hard game to play. I keep getting killed once I made it to the anti aircraft guns.
2,Wished the game looked sharper,"I bought this used for GAMECUBE, not Xbox, and the disc was like new, complete with instructions. The case looked crisp. I wish the game was as sharp-looking, though. The lighting is dim, but get your own experience, taste is subjective. The game looks alot more dim than Mario Sunshine, and probably equal to Metroid Prime. So if you don't mind the lighting in Metroid Prime, you probably wouldnt mind it in this game either. Dim visuals is enough to affect the fun factor in any game, 'for me'.What can I say, I like clear, bright-looking games."
3,It's ok.,"I think call of duty The big red one is an average game. It's good and all with the more things they added, but sucks that I beat it in six days. There's only 13 levels and a proloue and I played it only two hours a day."
2,Not very good,"Maybe I'm spoiled by Medal of Honor: European Assualt but I thought this game was pretty lame. Graphics don't stack up and movement is sometimes limited by ""junk"" in the way. Also, enemy soldiers are not set apart as well as they should be. In MOH, the weapon sights have a much better graphic where it turns red when an enemy is ""scoped"". Here, you just hope you've got him sighted and shoot away."
4,buddah bar,the cd is good....not greatnot what I expectedit had too much middle eastern influence in it
2,This is NOT from Bernard Sumner,"There is a group called Bad Lieutenant (no ""S"") that is comprised of Bernard Sumner, formally of New Order. This is NOT that group...buyer beware."
1,Not Allison Court,Our family was used to Allison Court in the lead role as Loonette. This is not the same actress and so the whole thing feels a little off. Next time I'll know to check for this in advance.
3,comfy couch,my granddaughter preffers to watch volume 4 better this ones seems to bore her a bit but its still a cute show
4,My daughter loves it!,"My daughter loves watching ""Molly"". It's a fun, silly show. It was hard to find the video, but Amazon had it and shipped it really quickly!"
4,I'll probably read it again sometime -- maybe soon.,"I agree with the positive reviews here and there's nothing more I need to add on that end. There are a few areas I think needed improvement (the Sam character gets tiresome after a while; the Alice character needed more delevopment in the beginning, as her re-entry at the end and Delano's new found affection for her seemed out of place; more time spent with Delano as a teacher, which was the funniest part I thought).It's a good satire -- the author pokes fun at just about everything under the sun involving college and schooling, and reminds us through the protagonist never to take life too seriously."
5,Can't stop laughing! and laughing!,"This book is an easy read because it so entertaining. I picked up the book and figured I would start off by reading a couple of chapters just before going to sleep. An hour and a half later and I still had not put the book down. My wife came into the living room to see ask why I had not come to bed yet. I did not answer right away. It was time to practice a little Eddie Delano, so I worked on my new skill of aquired deafness syndrome (chapter 11).If you like satires like Married With Children, South Park, or the Simpsons than Delano will have you cracking up. This is one book that you will not want to get the Cliff Notes for.However, I have one recommendation for the author, and that would be to add some pictures of Alice, Ashley, and Cheryl. LOL"
4,"humorous, easy reading","A very witty, fun, easy-to-read book. The characters are interesting, the plot is amusing, and the ending is unexpected. This book presents a subtle sarcasm of the college experience that college students will enjoy. Must reading for anyone considering a career in teaching or those who already are teachers, for the all-too-true scenarios of educational bureaucracy and parental ""involvement""."
5,Delano,John Orozco is a brilliant satirist...His humor will have you smiling inwardly and laughing outloud from the first sentence to the last.
3,get glass,i have a commercial bunn in my home and i work on them as a tech. the plastic and metal will separate over time and leak. don't believe me? just get a few and you will find out....
1,Expensive- Short lifespan,"Dishwasher safe yet not for use with ""Rinse Aid""... For the home user this makes for ""Not really dishwasher safe"" or at least it does for me. So I have used this pot every day for about a month and it has started a slow leak at the seam between the steel and plastic. This is the second Bunn plastic/steel decanter I have bought that leaks in this way. Poor design I guess.So here is the deal. I am very unhappy with this pot and another just like it. If two out of two do this for me in less than a year, chances are they will all leak under the same conditions. I personally prefer the long life of the glass decanter over the this plastic junk. I am sure I could get replacement but I am just sick of the effort.This purchase was depressing."
2,Cheap handle,The orange part of the handle has fallen out. I don't reccomend this product. Maybe get a stainless steel pot instead.
5,Hard to find Coffee Decanter,Works like a charm. Seems to be sturdy and unbreakable.Hard to find these replacement decanters in local stores and I tried serveral.
5,Good decanter.,I have been using a Bunn coffee maker for years now and have only had to replace 1 decanter. It was dropped and fell on the handle. Still think it is very durable and love the Bunn.
4,"Good, but not so everlasting ...","These vanilla mint treats are great for my JRT's breath and it's something she loves and looks forward to, so it's great for ending a good training session. But she's got it finished in about 5 minutes, so if you're looking for something that will keep your dog busy for awhile this isn't it ... unless you have a dainty eater."
5,Massive more fun,"To be quite honest, we haven't even broken into the expansion set yet, the regular game has soooooo many cards to begin with. But if we ever do start getting repeats this will come in handy. You can probably hold off until you need this."
4,GANGSTA GRIZZILLZ,"This DVD is timeless. I really dig the inside industry info that was talked about in this documentary. DJ Drama is the hottest DJ in the game right now, and it shows with every new project he releases. This is must have for any hip-hop junkie.I got mines, now you gotta get yours."
3,Good book but poor choice of modeling software.,"Interesting approach to modeling but it's all dependent on ithink, which is an absolutely old software program with a user interface from the Win 3.1 era. You'll be banging your head against the wall at the archaic nature of the program. Would've been a great program ten+ years ago but today I can't imagine anyone seriously wanting to learn this software. And in all honesty, the financial modeling section is hokey, as the manipulations are much easier done with excel."
2,"For average travelers, this guide is a bust!","Unless you aspire to travel like a ""Survivor"" fan, this book is not for you. It dwells on the most bizarre of activities and destinations that only a fraction of the population could find inviting or affordable. Enjoy the taste of grubs or insects? - This is for you. Got unlimited travel funds, come aboard.If you expect a book that narrows the world's most fulfilling and affordable destinations down to a practical choice, look elsewhere. This book was a major disappointment with only a few helpful pages."
3,Think of it as a supersized travel magazine,"Lots of articles or lists with moderate information (in the case of the article) or nuggets (in the case of the lists). Good resource to get you intrigued about a possible place to take your next trip, but for almost all of them, if you are obsessive enough to do this sort of reading about travel, you'll be obsessive enough to want a more specific guide! Great fun as a ""bathroom book"" for a travel buff, or as a way to energize yourself if you are at a loss for where to take your next trip. Photography in the book is good.I don't find it an awesome book, but I do find it a pretty good one. As mentioned in the title, I find it more like a supersized magazine than a travel book."
3,Rather random,"This isn't a reference book. You will not use it to find a travel destination based on criteria you have.How you will use this is by simply flipping through the top-10 lists to get ideas for trips/destinations you might not have previously considered. You might say ""Lebanon? Really?"" and then read about why it's a good destination. Or you might say ""Wow! That festival sounds awesome!"" and decide you need to travel to that location for those dates. Maybe the interesting facts about some of the places intrigue you, or maybe you had no idea you could take a London to Cape Town driving trip.This book was kind of a cure for ""vacationer's block"", and makes a decent coffee table book with the nice color photos; though as an idea generator I think it is not as comprehensive as other books such as the 1000 Places To Go type."
3,"Beautiful book, but not very useful","I don't make a habit of reading travel books, but this one caight my eye. Best in Travel 2009 is a beautiful book with many vivid color pictures of the different locations it advertises. Different locations are grouped together thematically.I had never heard of many of the locations discussed in this book. It was inetresting to read the little tidbits of info that was provided for these exotic locations and events.While the book has high entertainment value it is not very informational. If you ever wanted to travel to any of these places it would require a lot of effort on your part to research and plan the rip."
2,Travel to Baluchistan?,"I usually like Lonely Planet but suggesting to visit the ""mountainous Northwestern region of Pakistan"" will most likely end up in death."
3,Broken band,"The watch works fine, but the first time I went to put it on, the buckle broke and I had to take it to a jeweler's to fix."
3,Paintings only but anyway helpful,"Both books contain lovely paintings of about 500 different species of Eucalyptus. In most cases, only leafs and buds are painted.I have ordered this book around 1990 and was somehow dissapointed as I was searching for detailed information on Eucalyptus, including tree forms, growth and habit. This information is given as text only, but I expected it to be supplied by fotos.Of course it was my mistake not to check if the books fit my requirements.Anyway, the author has done very good work and it is quite obvious that he loves the family of Eucalytus."
1,Buy MTV Unplugged or any other Mana,"Whew, This is one of those badly produced, badly recorded, can't we find something to throw on a CD .... It is a shame that with the great work done by this band that this collection of rejects has made it into print. I was so unhappy with this disc that I was seriously tempted to try to get a refund on it. I love Mana, but there is no excuse for offering this to the public. Solo para Fanaticos? The Fanaticos deserve better. Bad retreds of old studio cuts."
4,Indy Does It Again,"GREAT BOOK! If not for Max McCoy I'd have to wait untill Indy 4 to see the world's greatest advent- urer taking care of fascits and charming the ladies on his neverending quest for fortune and glory. Indy's adventures before the movies are just as exciting and action-packed.McCoy's books have all the classic action and humor hardcore Indy fans like me live for. This was the 4th one I've read and while not as good as Philosopher's Stone, Hollow Earth and Dinosaur Eggs was still a dynamite Indy adventure. Any Indy fan has a winner with any of the McCoy novels. Only one suggestion: write a book with Indy's dad! ""Only the pennitent man shall pass..."" In closing, Indy is the man forever! If you disgaree, remember what Indy told Belloq in RAIDERS- "" Hahaha, sonuva..."""
3,Weak.....I can't believe we waited all that time for this...,"I was mildly intrigued by the concept, but it was under developed, as was every locale and the point of being there. I was disturbed by the fact on page 71 Indy replies to questions from Faye by telling her that he had never been married, when in fact he met and married Deidre Campbell before she died. This all occured in the first six novels by Rob MacGregor, which by the way is by far the best of the IJ writers."
1,Indiana Jones and the Secret of the Sphinx,"I totally agree with the reviewer that said, ""What ever happened to Rob MacGregor anyway?"" He was definitely the best author in the series. I loved the doctoral student Indy and his red-haired jazz loving friend. Bring them Back!"
4,My 11 year old son enjoyed it!,I bought this for my son to read. It was the first Indiana Jones book he has read and he told me he liked reading it. This is very important since he normally does not care to read. The key to getting him to read is finding books that capture his interest and make it fun. He wants to know when I am getting him the next one.
3,A bit confusing...,"While I must say that Max McCoy is my favorite of the Indiana Jones authors, and I'm sorry that this is his last book, Secret of the Sphinx had a couple of odd moments in it. There are veiled references to Indy looking older than he should and cryptic comments about past events that we don't seem to be privy to. Most disapointing is the total lack of explanation as to why they went to Egypt... a vital bit, considering the title. I've heard McCoy had ""creative differences"" with Bantam on this book... something to do with time travel. It makes me wonder if they've clipped passages from the book."
4,"Good, but it's no Philosopher's Stone.","The book had a great beginning, and I like the tie-in to Dinosaur Eggs, with the dagger. After that, the book slows a bit, then picks up when they begin searching for the staff of Aaron, which is one of my favorite artifacts in the books(the alicorn included). The Omega book is a very interesting find, but one is disapointed when (yet again) Indy and co. leave without the artifact that they have been searching for. This has happened HOW many times now?! I mean, the golden scroll, Noah's Ark, the Alicorn, the philosopher's stone, the holy grail, the list goes on and on. It's getting depressing. Sorry, I seem to have strayed a bit. To finish, McCoy is my favorite auther and it saddens me that this is his final book. Why couldn't he write six, like MacGreggor?!"
3,Needs editor,"Not a bad rollicking story for Indy fans, but where were the editors that allowed constant references to ""Pakistan"" in a story set in 1934(!) and Joan of Ark(note spelling) among other things. Ouch!"
3,Why the steep price?,I have been reviewing kettle bell dvd's to determine which one I would like to purchase and cannot help but notice that Lauren's dvd's cost at leasttwice as much as any other instructors? Even if she is as marvelous as everyone claims that she is. I was wondering if she comes to your house with the $40.00 dvd and throws in a personal training session? I currently do not own this dvd but had to rate it in order to ask my question.
5,Great/Quick Kettlebell Workouts,"Lauren's kettlebell workouts are quick and incorporate all the major muscle groups. From 6 minutes to 25 minutes, you can fit in a complete kettlebell workout any time of the day. I think this is a great format, & I hope Lauren's next dvd offers the same formatt but with even more workouts on one DVD."
4,FLAG POLE REVIEW,"The flag pole appears to be sturdy and is exceptional height. I removed one four-foot section (comes with five total)since all five would be way too tall for a residence in my opinion. I also placed a 10' PVC pipe inside the pole(1.25"" diameter)for added support against Florida winds. The gold aluminum ball sits above the top pole which I do not care for - my previous pole had the ball sit directly on top of the pole - still not bad looking though. My only real complaint is the hooks to attach the flag are plastic, but I understand these are can be easily replaced if necessary - I decided to leave as is for now. I am very happy with my purchase at this time."
3,Valley Forge In-Ground US Flag Kit 20' pole w/3X5 flag.,Product as advertised. Had to return first order do to inadequate shipper packaging. First order was shipped only in the display box and all items except poles and flag were missing from the kit. Second order was shipped inside a cardboard sleeve in additon to manufacturers packaging. Arrived OK.
4,Flag Pole,"This item is not perfect because it is aluminum, the pole dose shake in the wind. But I like it."
2,Fully MADE IN USA?......NOT! Caveat Emptor,"Quoting VFF web site""It is both Valley Forge Flag's philosophy and practice that U.S. flags be sourced, woven, dyed, finished, sewn, and distributed in the U.S.A. in domestically owned facilities with American labor.""That being said, ""LET THE BUYER BEWARE"" The fine print that you only see on the box once you order it is ""FLAG MADE IN USA"" other parts made in China. I purchased this because VF doesn't mention the fact that the pole and it's parts are imported. I was pretty confident that I was getting an all American product. I sent an email to them complaining about this via their web site and apparently they don't care what people think. I never got a response. The Flag and pole are very nice, but I wanted to purchase American made and not an import. I researched this for a week or two before deciding to make this purchase. BEWARE - It's not false advertising, just not being completely truthful. CAVEAT EMPTOR!!!"
2,Terrible Flag Mounting Instructions,"We bought the flag pole as a birthday gift for my Vietnam Veteran brother-in-law. Digging the hole, centering the base support pole, and mixing/pouring the two bags of Sakrete concrete mix went well. The problem we encountered was securing the top and botten ends of the flag to the nylon rope. The instructions printed on the box are horrible at best. The aluminum pole and various attached parts are made in China. The cloth flag is made in America, or at least that's what they say. It's too bad the American company selling the product and the Chinese manufacturer couldn't get together and produce a simple one page instruction sheet with black/white photos showing how the nylon rope attaches to the plastic ends that link the flag to the rope. In theory, it's a process that sounds quite simple. However, take a look at what's printed on the box. Then, try to mount the flag on the rope. May the spirit and wisom of Confucius be with you!"
2,Not strong enough,"I've purchased two of these Valley Forge poles in the past ten years. Both poles eventually broke at one of the joints. I'm now looking at possibly getting a steel pole, or at least one that will hold up to 40 mph winds."
5,You can't beat this value.,"In 2003, I purchased this flag pole at a Sam's Club. I installed it in a poured concrete footer at a home in Mauriceville, TX - right on Texas's Gulf Coast. Seven years and two major hurricanes (Rita and Ike) later, the pole is still standing proudly on that property. I no longer live there, but the flag pole still does.This value simply cannot be beat."
3,"Nice kit overall, but has very cheap/flimsy parts","I bought this as a replacement for one that was destroyed by tornadoes. The price of this kit is very good, but the cleat, which is used to secure the halyard to the pole, is made out of plastic. It snapped in half the first time I raised my flag and attempted to secure the halyard to the pole. I've never seen or heard of residential flag pole kits having plastic cleats, only metal. Amazon will replace the flag pole for an exact item, but why would anyone want another flimsy piece of plastic that will break the first time it's used?I'll have to buy a replacement cleat from another seller and attach it to this pole. Overall, the hassle I now have to go through to get this thing working correctly isn't worth the $20 or $30 I saved by buying from Amazon. I'd recommend another vendor for this product."
2,Defective Shipping / Missing Parts,Missing Truck (Pulley) from box. Only option was to return entire order. Had one from current installation (This was a replacement to my existing flag pole that was wind damaged). I used that one.
4,Outstanding value,"Recently ordered the 20 foot flag and am pleased with the result. I would recommend the Valley Forge Co.,to anyone."
3,Valley Forge 20 ft flagpole,"The fastener where you tie off the the rope broke immediately after hoisting the flag. Flimsy,(fastener) not made of metal but plastic with silver coating. Will attempt to contact seller for replacement...."
4,Great But With Minor Flaw,"First off, the flag is made in the USA, but the pole, rope, etc. is made in China. Secondly, the main problem I noticed, like another reviewer, is that the rope bracket was on the wrong end of the next to bottom pole piece. I decided to remove the bracket piece and drill the holes in the correct location and remount it. A bit sloppy that they didn't check the poles to make sure they were correct before distributing them, but I guess if they did this, the price would be much higher possibly. Either way, it's great once it's mounted in the ground."
5,Excellant addition to any property,"It looks elegant, enhances my property, and makes me feel proud. I never leave it up at night and never when it either rains or snows, however it can withstand strong winds. Setup was relatively easy. I moved the cleat to a spot where I could more easily reach it. The digging and the mixing of the cement took an effort that the average homeowner should not find too difficult. Look for the installation instructions on the box."
4,flag pole,product was of good quality and fit together well only problem was that the bracket that tyed down the rope was not on right end of pole section
4,"Still in the box, as we have snow on the ground","I think the product is nice, but I was not impressed by the packaging. Arrived in a box within a box, but no bottom closure, and one pole sticking out through an area that was never taped. Looked like someone could have pulled a section out, or it would fall out. I was not happy, but lucky for me all the parts seem to be there."
1,NOT GOOD IN THE WIND,"After installing my flag kit, I received many compliments. We just have some good wind(50 MPH) for the first time since I installed it and the pole bent. I would not install this pole if you have winds over about 20 MPH"
1,20' Sectional Flag pole,"I was very disappointed in the stability of this flag pole. It wobbles and shakes at the joints and is not strong enough to hold a 4' x 6' foot flag nor is it strong enough to hold two flags. I am actually going to have to replace the pole because when I added my USMC flag it bent the pole. The metal actually bent, not the joints so now I have a curved pole. I am going to contact the manufacture as well."
1,"Wind took it down, and parts too expensive to repair.","We bought this flag as a Christmas gift for my parents on December 17, 2011. On March 19th we has winds hit approximately 50mph and the pole went down. Checked Amazon and January 31, 2012 was the last day we could return it without having to pay all shipping and only a partial refund. Called the local flag dealer for Valley Forge flags and they wanted $27 for each section of aluminum tubing, and we needed 2, so it would run me $54+ to get the two pieces replaced.So I'm a bit disappointed to say the least. If you do purchase one of these and you live in a place with winds, I would highly recommend a 20' section of steel pole be run down the middle of the aluminum poles to strengthen them."
3,"Looks Great, But.....","Installation was fairly easy with good instructions and the end result was satisfactory.However, during a recent wind & rain storm the lower section permanently bent some 5"" off center resulting in a very distressed & unappealing display. Even though this part failed within two weeks of installation Valley Forge Flag Co wants $35 for the replacement part & shipping....So, beware if you live in an area with even occasional high wind & rain conditions. This product is not for you. The metal gage is not appropiate for this type of installation..."
3,Good Flag Bad Pole,"The flag pole was not as sturdy as expected and had to be reinforced by inserting 1 1/2"" PVC pipe inside to keep it from bending in 25 MPH sea breezes. The kit in all other respects was satisfactory. The flag itself was great quality and ""Made in the USA"" (important to me).One section of the pole tube was bent upon arrival. I suppose if I had seen it physically before buying I would have ordered the ""heavy duty"" pole. The flag arrived early and was proudly flying on the Fourth of July. Thanks to Amazon for making the purchase seemless."
3,A Year in the Life of a Failed Suicide,"Drawn by the noirish cover art of a nude lightly bound in red ribbon, one uncovers an insightful first novel in ""Stacking in Rivertown,"" by Barbara Bell. This pageturner proves easy for the reader to follow despite its flashbacks, name changes for the ex-prostitute protagonist, and overworked metaphors.From this cover, one might imagine that this novel is about S/M; however, even though some of its ""plays,"" which are ""directed"" by Ben, a violent pimp, have a sadomasochistic tinge, ""Stacking"" is more about the posttraumatic stress disorder of Beth, a young woman who survives childhood sexual abuse and subsequent torture by Ben and his minions.Reading this story requires a willing suspension of disbelief because many of the plot elements simply do not make sense. Nonetheless, the prose is lyrical in places, and there are some scenes that are very humorous."
4,A thrilling read,Stacking in Rivertown was really a thrilling read. It was a bit of a shocker at times. The plot twists kept my interest and I found it particulary enjoyable. I look forward to the author's next book.
4,A SPLENDID DEBUT!,"This novel is truly a splendid debut by a new writer with talent to burn! Others have summarized the story. Let me only add that the writing is elegant and sensitive, and that the characters and narrative are deeply haunting. So superior to most first novels, ""Stacking In Rivertown"" is difficult to put out of mind. In this era of disposable culture, that is as fine a compliment as I can offer. Bravo, Ms. Bell!"
5,Blast to the pschic anatomy!,"To say this was a surprise is an understatement. At first, I didn't think I would like it, but as I read I was brought into a frightening and painful world. A world rendered in beautiful prose bordering on poetry with a musical elelment. I read it in one day. Could not put it down. What a piece of contemporary literature. Kudos to the author."
1,this is not a good thing...,"i LOVE jcs, but this is just awful. i just dont even believe how bad this is... it doesnt sound like these people are singing, it sounds like they are dying slow deaths. oh, i just cant even believe it."
1,"Good God II (Pardon the Pun, again)","You know, 1995 was a bad bad year for this musical. All of the recordings I have heard form this year are bad, rotten, junk, garbage, etc... This is no exception. Judas needs have passion and range, and this Judas has wailing and a tons of missed high notes. What confuses me is how do these studio albums make it out of the studio. One of these musicians or technicians has to have perfect pitch, heck, normal pitch; and anyone listening to this in the first minute is going to realize that this studio recording missed wide. Not to mention the stylings of Rowe are abysmal.Ugggg... again...."
5,tons of emotion and incredible rock-n-roll vocals,"this is an incredible collection of vocal performances, Andrew Lloyd Webber was in a very creative mood when he first composed these awesome arrangements and unusual chord changes. way beyond typical rock of the time, and the vocals will never be equalled."
4,good hedge trimmer,"I find the trimmer very well balanced and there is a minimium of vibration. The trimmer may not have the power of a corded version but not having to deal with a cord is well worth any small loss of power. It works well and has enough power for what I use it for. The charger also serves as a hanger for the unit. My only complaint is with the battery/charger. According to the owners manual, leaving the trimmer on the charger while it is plugged in over 24 hours may damage the battery. Toro recommends plugging the charger in a minimium of 3 hours before use. Otherwise the trimmer can hanger on the charger as long as the charger is unplugged. Maybe not a big deal if you remember to plug it in before you start your lawn care duties. It would be nice to plug in the charger, hang the trimmer on it and use it at will without some planning ahead of time.In summary, it is a quality trimmer at a good price with a minor irratation."
2,"Its a good chair, but doesn't have all it says it does!!","The main reason I bought this chair as opposed to dozens of others was because it claimed it had A towel and jar holder!It doesn't have either!!! I was so upset to find this out, but not sure if I will return it or not, just so upset they claim untrue information. I'd say this chair is good, but no better then the other dozens just like it!"
4,Good Summer Discs,"These cds may have their cheesy tracks (sclub7, ex-spice girl Geri Halliwel, etc.), but all in all they are good summer cds. The cds feature many monster US hits such as NSync's ""Bye Bye Bye"", Britney Spears's ""Sometimes,"" etc. but they also spotlight some lesser known Euro groups. They also have a lot of good techno and dance tracks. All in all, it is good pop fun, great for a day at the beach."
2,looks good but just doesn't 'cut' it,"I bought this can opener because I wanted one in black and a stand-up electric that take up less counter space and is for tall cans. We've had a few problems with misfires. The unit would not grip the can and we had to re-align it. It also needs a little more power. The magnet that is supposed to grip the lid is not strong enough. The unit gets two stars, one for the color and one for the shape."
2,Good while it lasted...,"Good functional can opener for about 1 year. It still turns, but the handle becomes 'stuck' and is finniky to work. In the end, after 1 year we've had enough with it. It still turns, but it won't open cans for some unknown reason. We've washed it, etc... Also, the base is a bit light for the heavier soup cans and it isn't tall enough for the tall beans cans. Buy a different can opener- not this one. My next one will be from West Bend. Always go with the best reviews!!"
1,Broke easily,Thought it would a no-brainer that a $20 can opener would function. Heavyweight? Maybe the base. Featherweight lever unit. Plastic piece broke off - the piece that triggers the motor to run. Looks nice. Will never open a single can with it. Had an undercounter B&D for many years. Will go back to that brand.
4,Does it job. Still working after 4 years and counting.,"This has been serving us for over 4 years now. It has a strong magnet that holds the top of the can, so after opening, it won't fall and drown inside the can. If it is medium sized to large sized can, you would need to hold the can for support. A little heavy but that is necessary for stability. You would need to learn how to position the can, but once you get the hang of it, you'll find it easy to work with. It is actually not a very complex machine at all.We think the price is pretty reasonable for a machine that works for years (we paid less than 20$ at the time)."
1,Two thumbs down.,"Please read David Maces's review. I bought mine about two years ago and just today the plastic part mentioned by Mr. Mace failed. A sturdy, sleek can opener is now going to the trash permaturely because Hamilton Beach does not provide a replacement part."
1,owner hb,i have this model people are right on after about 20 cans plastic piece broke off it is unbelievable that engineers refuse to use metal at all costs everything these days never lasts which makes all companys keeping you buying.Plastic is always what fails every improved model is more expensive and made cheaper than the previous always buy the old model before you buy the new.
1,Designed to FAIL,"There is a tiny metal cam that drives a very brittle plastic gear on the front of the can opener that drives the removable can opener top. After a couple of years, this plastic gear will BREAK. Hamilton Beach does not carry replacement parts.The whole thing is JUNK once that brittle bit of plastic breaks.Too bad, the whole rest of the can opener is nice and in very servicable condition. I don't think it even opened 100 cans before it broke. If that gear had been brass, it probably would have lasted forever. Now it's landfill."
1,I concur with David Mace's review,Once that plastic part breaks ... its over.I can not find a replacement part for it.Otherwise nice can opener.
1,Junk after 1-2 years,"As others have stated the gears are plastic and will fail after 1 to 2 years, and no replacement parts to fix, so the can opener has to trashed."
1,PIECE OF JUNK,"Initially purchased this item due to the easy cleaning feature, however have been very disappointed with the performance since I purchased it only 3 months ago. Edges of the lids are extrememly jagged and scraps of metal & label often land in the food! And now after 3 months, the motor is worn out and the unit buzzes whenever I attempt to use it. The cutting tool won't even pierce the can without some forcefull manipulations. Bottom line, don't waste your money."
1,Won't Open a Can,"I purchased this can opener because I have used other hamilton beach products and loved them, but this can opener is horrible. It would not even open the first can I tried. Ended up using a manual can opener to finish. Also the top ""removeable"" part is extrememly flimsy and cheap feeling. Kept falling off while I was trying to use it. This went straight back to the store I bought it from. Don't waste your time or money and just go with a different can opener."
2,broken plastic gear,"Like other reviewers, great unit that worked for several years then the plasic gear broke. Wish I could get a replacement part."
4,does the job,Needed to change my old can opener which I had forever. This was reasonable and i liked how it looked. Have had it a few months now and it works just fine.
4,The Countess,"I love this opperetta! I was first introduced to it when I was cast as a village child, actually Juliska and the music just waltz's my worries away!"
2,a bit 2 chocolatie for me,i was a bit disappointed at the product b/c it's got too much chocolate on it. they tasted more like candy bars more so than just chocolate covered cashews.
5,Great Screen for the $,"I was waiting to find a 30"" LCD television with a brand that I know at less than $1000. When the Westinghouse appeared, I was hesitant because WH isn't known for its televisions. I figured I would give it a try.The picture is great, and there are a lot of different input options (cable, S-video, computer serial port, AV). This made it easy to hook up my cable, DVD, and video game systems without having to buy expensive adapters.Although the resolution isn't as good as higher priced TVs, it looks good from about 10 feet away, and I am really enjoying it."
4,Great TV - bad buttons,"After owning this TV now for a few years, I've found that the physical ""on/off"" button starts to develop problems (eventually you're forced to use the remote only), and sometimes after being turned on it improperly formats the screen, but otherwise the picture is great with no ghosting, multiple screen formats, and clear colors. I've never noticed a stuck pixel or any major distortions. For the money I paid ($1,500 then), it was definitely worth it."
1,Complete meltdown after 2 years,"Purchased TV in Fall of 2004 for over $1,800. Recently died and took it to a TV repair company. They told me they can't get Westinghouse parts and that even if they could, the main circuit board was fried and it would cost about $650. They also told me Westinghouse offers them no technical support. I called customer support to complain and they refused to give me the phone number for the corporate office. Don't buy Westinghouse products."
4,Works for me!,"I bought this mount to support a Vizio 32"" FHDTV. Previous reviews suggested that this produt does no work with the Vizio 32"". I bought it anyway, understanding that the VESA mounting standard was supported by both Vizio an this wall mount, betting it would work.In fact, this mount works perfectly with the Vizio. It mounts the TV relatively close to the wall (with just enough room for running wires into a hole in the wall behind the bracket). The mounting hardware comes with the product. I found a stud slightly off center and used the included lag bolts to mount it to the wall. Rock solid. I then used the included screws to mount the vertical brackets to the TV, and this is key: With the hooks that attach to the bracket on the INSIDE. Then, just placed the TV on the bracket. Done. It works great.The confusion about which side the hooks go on apparently confuses some. Getting that right makes it work well."
1,Enough ragging on the girl with the 6 month old,"Okay people. Please, enough ragging on the girl with the 6 month old. I would really like to know about the carseat not listen to the constant nag, bickering, and whining at this girl. None of the comments and remarks that you have made so far has made me want to buy this carseat. I really want to know the pro's and con's of the carseat and what makes it worth buying. This is supposed to be carseat reviews not soap opera central. I think one comment to this girl is sufficient and everyone else is just wasting their time and breath. Now please tell us about the carseat. Thank You!!!"
3,Recommended Use,"I had to rate it so i chose 3 stars because it looks like a neat TODDLER carseat, not what i was looking for though (i need a convertible car seat)...Before anyone purchases this online note the Recommended Use of this product says the following...As Per gracobaby.com this is: Toddler SafeSeat(Step 2) 8B00BDRUse the Toddler SafeSeat forward facing only for children 20 to 40 lbs and up to 43 inches tall. **Also the child MUST be over 1 Year old to face forward**"
2,Great . . . if you drive a bus!,"This seat is comfy & surrounds your baby with padding. The super-easy recline is a GREAT feature! BUT . . . it takes up TONS of space. We installed in our Ford Explorer. Even with the front seat almost all the way forward, there's still only 4-6 inches available for baby to dangle his legs & feet. No way would his feet fit with the seat in full recline position. Unfortunately, it's going back to the store! :-("
1,It broke.,"I have no idea what happened to it. It was playing perfectly. The quality of this CD player is better than any other player I've ever owned. This morning, as I walked out to the bus, it refused to read my CD. Every other CD I tried either would not be read, took forever to be read and then shut off, or the player would skip almost every track and play a very few. Even with those few, the track would skip. I tried this with scratched and unscratched CDs, and it's certainly not the CD. How long have I had it? A week and a half. I'm very upset, because it's the best CD player I've ever owned and usually, Sony players put up with all the abuse they go through in my life. This one? Not at all. I'm resorting back to my old one that is nearly in two pieces but still plays perfectly. Good luck with the Psyc; I didn't have any."
4,Cruise missile hits it target.....,"For those of us left who seek out unusual musicthis new Cruise missile hits it target, for themost part. I gave this one 4 stars as there areso many off the wall pieces included here, but theyall blend so well with the beautiful chill feelattitude, she hasn't sounded this good on vocalsand the chatting goings on inbetween songs helpskeep this from sameness at times. I've put this onein on random and it really sounds great. I to wassmiling when I heard the last track blending intoher classic ""Fallin"" newly touched up, shes oneof kind."
3,Insidious grooves that sneak up on you...,"but it may take a few listens, as Julee Cruise's seductive vocals and occasionally monotone rythmns prove to be hypnotic and yet inscrutable. Leaving behind past collaborators David Lynch and Angelo Badalamenti, Cruise is nimble and careful and playful, but the songs are set on a slow-burning flame. After repeated listens, I discovered greatly quiet nuances in ""Everybody Knows"" (probably the album's best song), the initially raucous but contemplative ""9th Ave. Limbo"" and the humorous opener ""You're Staring at Me"". Not a bad CD, not as great as Cruise's earlier work, but she has to move on and so do we. Everybody, even '80's sirens, have to grow up."
4,A new direction for Julee,"I love Julee's earlier cds, especially ""Floating Into the Night."" The ethereal vocals, the strange arrangements all blend perfectly to create a one of a kind atmosphere, spooky and romantic. If you don't have that cd, buy it.This cd is nothing like her earlier work, being mainly lounge inspired chill and electronica. However, her voice is still great, and the songs are often quirky, with unique touches. Some of the cd, however, falls into what is now cookie-cutter for the trip hop genre. Overall, it is a somewhat uneven effort, but it has enough high points and variety to recommend it."
1,Fuhgedaboutit....,"If you like her first two (Lynch/Badalamenti) albums you probably won't like this one, it's very average. It's not interesting enough to be good and has enough strange moments that it isn't suitable as background music either. Save your money & buy 'Blue Bob' instead. Shame really..."
5,A collection of essays from a master,"A collection of essays, articles, and chapter length contributions to other books. Readers new to Argyris might wish to start with ""Knowledge for Action: A Guide for Overcoming Barriers to Organizational Change"". ""On Organizational Learning"" expands and deepens what you will learn in ""Knowledge for Action"". The bottom line is that Argyris's work is as highly respected as the name is hard to spell. I give this book a 9 instead of a 10 only because of the academic style of the writing, the content is outstanding. - Cortlandt Wilson, Software Consultan"
3,Dont spend the money,"This is an ok lens, but I had to sell it less than 6 months later becuase it just was not up to speed with the zoom and f stops.....Trust me on this, get the canon (IS if you can afford it)a 2x if you need and you are set. this lens is OK, but why get OK when you can get amazing for almost the same price."
1,Waste of hard earned money,This book is a compilation of what Merle thinks are comical situations and how they affect marketing your business. He goes on for pages with these ancedotes that do absolutely nothing to help you learn how to get your business going. Then there are about 20 pages of glossary terms and xeroxed copies of forms that you would get if you asked for information on a clearing house.This book is spiral bound and is not worth your time. If you read this book you come away feeling cheated and the realization that this book was written for profit not to help you start a business.
1,DO NOT BUY,"Okay I sell alot of used cds & dvds so I have tried alot of products that claim to repair scratches. Some work pretty good like Aleratec's machine. But this stuff is not only crap but it will ruin your DVD player! Seriously! I tried it on a DVD and then went to play it. The disc would not read (mind you this was a pretty new player) So I tried another player same story. Well that's okay like I said I have tried alot of these so-called repair products so I wasn't really surprised when it didn't work. The real surprise came after when I tried to play another disc and my player couldn't read it. So I tried a brand new disc, same story! Then I tried to use the other player I have. Same story again! This crap ruined 4 discs and 2 players and good luck getting any help from the con artist selling this crap! I just can't waste another minute writing about this junk. So let me sum it up in 3 words: DO NOT BUY!"
1,Ruins Disks!,Took a disk that was skipping and turned it into one that can no longer be read. Do not buy!
4,One of my favorite books.,This book is emotional and yet very easy to follow. I recomend this book to any reader who needs a break from the usual dry meaningless readings of todays litterature!
5,Lords of Chaos,"I wealth of information for the Black Metal fan.Heavy information on Viking / Norway Meatal Scene.Good background on bands and the Scene in 80/s and early 90's.NOT enough information on the Varg and Euronymous fued but a good read. More information on Church Burnings and trials would have been nice also. If you are into Dark Throne, Burnzum, Mayhem and celtic frost this is for You. Are you Morbid?"
3,Varg Worship,"I do like Varg, I Agree with some of the Heathen Front, Idealogy, I enjoy learning the History of an Awesome Sound of Music, I love reading about history on almost any subject, but I never finished the book, I got sick of Varg and how everything was related to Varg, almost every page mentions Varg or what Varg thought on this and that, If I wanted to read Vargsmal I would have So if you Love VARG and pretty much only want to read about VARG for most of the book, buy it actually buy it for all the parts that are not VARG worship ,"
5,Very informative,"I really immersed myself in this experience. The details of this book are very complete; every lead is followed to its end. There is not much speculation here; most is told through interviews. This is probably more than you ever wanted to know about black metal unless you have some kind of morbid fascination with it (like I do). I especially found the interview with Bard Eithun to be captivating. It would be interesting to see an update of this book, since it was first released in 1998, and black metal has done nothing but expand since that time."
5,Real Deal,Reading this book just filled me in on the details. I love the Norway metal scene and the music from Mayhem. I remember all of this happening. If you like this kind of music or (like myself) watched this unfold then this is the book for you. Moyhihan really put his time and knowledge into this. A must for black metal fans.
4,He's not the devil - he's a very naughty boy ...,"A fascinating account of the formation of Norwegian Black Metal and its aftermath that attempts to delve into the minds of a handful of originators. The first half of the book makes for intriguing reading as the events of the black metal subculture branch out into an unsuspecting society. The latter half of the book attempts to discover the motivation behind the more sinister deeds of the black metal fraternity, but at times tends to be a little confusing and lacking focus, which is possibly a reflection of the state of mind of the book's antagonists. The authors successfully present the facts and let the reader draw their own conclusions, ensuring this book is a great conversation starter."
4,A good introduction to conroversial stories.,"I don't know much about Black Metal and the bands that are mentioned in this book, but the story is fascinating. Even if it were fiction, it would be worth a read.As you can see by reading many of the other reviews, there are many versions of the stories reported here.In my opinion, this is the best place to start for the novice or the unintiated in the world of Black Metal."
4,Interesting,I found this book interesting because it gives a nice cross-section of black metal music and the minds of young musicians. The best thing about this book is the interviews with the musicians themselves where they are given opportunities to respond to accusations made against them; although Varg Vikernes said after the book was published that some of the things said about him by other interviewees were false.I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in psychology of youth movements or anyone who is just interested in black metal. Rather than writing about the psychology of this music and its fans and overanalysing it Moynihan simply presents it in interviews.
4,A Good Read but a little boring at parts...,"This book deatails ""the Bloody Rise of the Satanic Metal underground"" and it does just that but its not perfect. It details mostly Norweighan black metal but does do some background information on the advent of satanic music. Its got slayer and even some very obscure bands such as Coven. it goes on and talks about the murder of black metal mainstay Oystein ""Euronymous"" Aarseth by fellow black metaller Varg ""Count Grishnahck"" Vikernes. it talks about Dead, and basically only about Mayhem, because the scene had so much more to offer. anyways a good read but all of the info is on the net and not as focused so much on Vikernes"
1,Don't buy the book,"I bought this because I was interested in the bands and what happened. I am really into the music and like it a lot. The authors apparently do not. They also have no sympathy for alternative religious views. They have focused almost entirely on the sensational aspects of the scene. They appear to have no awareness that many of musicians they are interviewing are putting them on. Most obviously Dani Filth, whose band is not actually Black Metal.I only read about half of it, skipping around. They repeat the same stuff a lot. The Jungian analysis parts are just silly. Their pro Christian anti Satanist propaganda is lame. I guess they are trying to scare people off this music and frighten the parents of the fans."
2,"Pretty dry, considering the subject","One of those ""not quite"" books: Not quite a dissertation, not quite true crime, not quite music, not quite sociology. I give it a ""meh."""
5,helpfull Book,"This book was very helpful,Im disapoint with some paragraphs but still very interesting the entire book!"
1,A storm in a cup of tea...,"...A reader may finish (if he can, I couldn't, that interesting it was...) the book, non the wiser as he was when starting reading it. All a collage of tabloid gossip, totally useless and boring, no insight and nothing new, without any philosophy behind it whatsoever...All the book shows, is a bunch of bored and not so intelligent kids, who took thier D&D role playing into the reality world, in which they continued to pose and do senseless harm to others, with out any high philosophy or principles. All this piece of [junk] for a book gives the reader, is all the more reasons not to be listening to Black Metal and in it National Socialist Black Metal bands, which is as stupid as its creators. Utter waste of money!!!..."
3,Tedium Ad Nauseum,"The only book that I know of on this subject, so if you're interested in ""Black Metal"" (which I think is fascinating, sometimes hilarious, and often sickening subject) then this is the book you're going to have to get. Unfortunately this work needed some serious editing which it never got. The history of the music is good, but the book soon turns into mind-numbingly repetitive interviews with ""Varg"", the most notorious personality in the scene. Furthermore, the illustrations are mostly pointless. Numerous redundant photos, again of Varg, with him wearing the same blank expression in each, and dozens of little devil drawings and so on which are not connected to the text nor justified in any other way. This book should have been half as long."
2,Watch out for blunders and errors!,"The good thing about this book is that it covers a subject mostly averted by the media, at least for what I've seen and know: the Black Metal scene, specifically the Norwegian, and the stories behind it. As a B.M. listener, roaming through stores and talking to friends, I eventually bumped on some twisted versions about the Varg - Euronymous incident. The more I asked, the more I realized the little people knew about the story, although they all heard about it. Decided to know about it, I entered Burzum's site and read all the stuff there.I do not agree with Varg in lots of things, specially the Nazi stuff, but what I must say that is relevant to this review is his pointing out of many errors and mistakes throughout the book, page by page. Some errors are clearly bad-intentioned, and add to a sensionalistic character in this book. Beware."
1,Cheap sensationalism!!!,This book tells lies. Simple like that.It was written to sell and not to describe the history of black metal.And it's not based on the truth.Look for Hellhammer's opinion in the internet.
1,Lords of Miss Quotes,"All Propaganda on part of authors...this book is highly wrong on a number of very important and key facts...You would think the publisher would have fact checked...this book is a waste of time...and if you really want to know about black metal, then you really should just LISTEN to the MUSIC..not read this book and support someone that wants to cash in on something special for money..."
3,Krigen mot alt!,"I've been a fan of black metal since 1989 when I got My first Mayhem tape (Deathcrush), and a Darkthrone bootleg. I've read alot of stuff about what went on in Norway in Kerrang!, Pit, and several other mags and online zines, and net friends from Norway. This book is a good primer for the novice Black Metal fan who knows nothing of the past, or the scene.I think the space that the author wasted on Absurd would've been better suited to describe in depth the Black Metal scenes from around the world, like the Vinland scene for instance."
3,Running on empty..,"This book was like a white-knuckle ride down a long stretch of desert highway.. without making that crucial stop at the gas station that has the sign ""last gas for 100 miles"". The book starts out great... all the meaty stories of violence, burning, murder, the fight for control for a small tight-knit scene, and the results.. The problem for me is about the last 1/3rd of the book. The book up until then makes a good case for why things happened the way they did- the history of the Nordic people, the imagery of their mythology embodied in the actions of Black Metal followers, and the tying in of National Socialism of Europe. However, when Anton Levey is bought in for his 2 cents, and a expose of American violence and murder related to metal music, it just gets boring.. I don't even like what people like Varg or Euronymous espouse, and their music.. but I have to admit, the story is very poignant.."
3,Misleading,I did not like this book because it is full of contridictions and politics From Varg Vikernas Black Metal Has alot of great artist like venom mayhem or celtic frost those are real black metal bands.Hellhammer is a great drummer but he said Black metal is for white people but look at him does he look white?Also alot of bands are nationalist.for those who dont know nationalism is complete believe that no nation should mix any culture or traditions but at the same time they use instruments from other cultures Like guitars and drums which is completly irrelavent thus the nazi parts of black metal are not to be takin seriosly.This book focusis to much on varg instead of real Black metal dudes like dead or euronymous.This book Is saying black metal is about crime instead of metal which is not true.This is why I did not like the book
1,Moloch's Power Chord Puppets,"The only good thing about this lower astral plane charade is that it will allow anyone with a smidgen of spirit, intelligence, and light to see the stupidity of the black metal musicians themselves and how they are unwilling to admit that they are mere Power Chord Puppets for some smokescreened corporate Moloch wearing a three piece Armani suit, sipping a Martini and listening to lounge music."
4,brillant!!!,"i recently read this book as a recommendation from my boyfriend,a heavy metal freak, and i must say i thought it very well put together and the interviews seemed so intense,i loved it.i know many people consider ""black metal""a subdivision of heavy metal a basically juvenile,often asocial,loud ,shrill,and sexist form of aggressive rock and roll with satanic overtones, and well to generalize it thats about right. it's something interesting about how involved people get when they truly believe in something so...........amatuer. dont get me wrong im a metal head myself but some of the interviews i read were completely apalling. the murder ,the suicide,the music ,and the church burnings, a wonderful book,however not recommended for religious folks,sorry!"
1,This book is purely right-wing garbage!,"I have been into black metal since the very beginning of the genre. I have excellent knowledge of what lead to most of the Norwegian incidents (both the church burnings & the murders), and therefore this book deeply troubles me! It seems the authors of ""Lords of Chaos"" are having serious problems being objective. The most obvious example is Moynihan's sympathy for Varg Vikernes and his activities - his admiration shines through in every second line, and makes him present several grave errors when it comes to the ""facts"" of the book.""Lords of Chaos"" is a book you should NOT buy - it's facist propaganda pretending to be objective journalism, and it should never have been published in the first place!"
1,Inaccurate,"I have numerous black and death metal albums and am a huge fan of extreme metal but trust me this book has a skeleton of truth and a lot of inaccuracies.I talked to Hellhammer when he toured with Dimmu last month and he told me the book misquoted him. What he originally said was some Norwegians are racist, and then the book published him as saying he himself was. That couldn't be farther from the truth. He is a very tolerant person.Also if you look in google for Varg Vikernes's webpage he lists all the inaccuracies of the book down to pages and paragraphs.This is a propaganda book, much like when Hollywood turns your favorite book into a movie and then they turn the story into what they want it to be."
3,Pavia 1525,"Pavia 1525 is a typical Osprey Campaign book (for those familiar with the type). The author does a good job of identifying and differentiating between the different people and forces involved in this somewhat confused campaign. I found Mr. Konstam's narrative and analysis quite good. While Pavia may have been the ""Climax of the Italian Wars,"" don't look for a great deal of tactical or historical sgnificance. The book's greatest drawback is sloppy editing. The text is occasionally broken up, or even repeated. The captions often refer the reader to some detail of a postage-stamp-sized picture, indicating that the editor was more concerned with page layout than informative content."
2,Dissatisfaction,Flag itself is great quality. Did not like the flag pole that was permanently affixed to the flag holder. It would be impossible to take the pole down since it is welded into the flag holder.
1,Not a good quality instrument - NOT good for a beginner,"I am a elementary school band teacher. One of my students bought this clarinet and it is terrible. It is very cheap plastic - one of the tone holes needed to be filed down with a emery board because the hole had an edge of sharp plastic. In addition, the keys are a cheap metal that bends easily. It is shipped with reeds that are equally cheap and flimsy. I would not recommend this. Rent a good quality instrument if you are unsure of your child's dedication."
1,Don't buy this clarinet,"My daughter recently joined a band at her school. She was given this clarinet to play and practice with. The first time she brought it home I was shocked to learn that it was made of poorly crafted plastic and the metal was very flimsy. This clarinet is out of tune and extremely cheap. I would not recommend this clarinet for anyone, unless you want a shiny piece of plastic to hang on your wall. Her clarinet is currently with her band teacher because one of the key pads fell off when she was playing. Although inexpensive, if you buy this clarinet you will get ripped off completely. This clarinet over a short period of time will fall into disrepair and is an awful product."
2,"Good product, bad description","The name of this product is decieving. It is not an anamorphic adapter for changing the aspect ratio of a camera. Even the ""official"" photo is shot in such a way that it looks like the front lens curves more horrizontally than vertically, thus exaggerating the confusion of its purpose. Descriptions all over the internet say that it essentially makes the field of view like that of a 16:9 camera. This is nothing other than a wide angle lense adapter. It seems to be a good one, but that's all it is. The biggest downfall of it is that you cannot put threaded filters on the front of it. Probably a precaution to prevent vingetting but would have been an easily solved issue with a step-up ring."
1,"a very cheap piece, indeed","i bought it because it was all over cute and very cheap. but when it came, the small beads were some cheap-looking plastic ones, and the paint already came off. it just looks like a little girl's worn toy.not recommended"
3,Interesting History of WW2,The book was very good at covering the history WW2. The make up of Army divisions and artillery.It was about the movement of it's author as they accured From before entering the service to his movements through Europe and Germany. He brought to light the villages and what the German people were like in that terrible time. His stories of flying were few and undetailed however. There is more ground time than flight time.
4,Good News (1995 Studio Cast),"Fun music and my child loves this CD to use for her 'shows' at home. One of the songs, Life is Just a Bowl of Cherries, was even used in one of her talent shows...it really is full of great songs."
3,An interesting read,Gary Wills traces what he can verify of the history of the rosary as prayers beads and glosses over any spiritual inspiration in its origin. He analyzes most of the elements of the rosary including four of the prayers and the mysteries associated with it. He neglects to mention the Fatima Prayer. But he does discuss the biblical scriptures behind the rosary and the human need for contemplation. The work does show some of his problems with some Catholic beliefs. This seems to be his personal understanding that he shares with us.
4,"Addition to collection, not an introductory course","This book is not quite a guide to the Rosary in itself, so much as it's an addition to a collection. It's like a very well-made booklet that you pick up for free in the church lobby, more detailed and with better pictures and written with great style. I found that it really got me thinking about more aspects of the mysteries, as well as giving some historical/theological background on various aspects of the rosary and of the mysteries themselves.Wills is known to be a vocal critic of the Catholic Church; yes, some of the things he says in here are not Orthodox. Like I said, this is an addition to a collection, and as long as one isn't using this book as an introductory course on the Rosary then Wills' political (and theological) gripes don't interfere too much with the reflective nature of the book, which is superb."
2,The Rosary for Non-Christians,"I received this book in the hope that I would learn something great about my favorite prayer. Instead, I found many comments and quotes that oppose the teaching of the Church on some of the central mysteries of the faith. Why meditate on the mysteries of the Gospel by praying the Rosary if we only half believe them (or only believe them in some secularized symbolic and romantic way?) There are some interesting historical facts, but a Catholic believer would find this book sad. Mr. Wills wrote something that he seems not really a part of in the familiar, devoted way Rosary believers and prayers are."
1,Krups Aromacontrol Type 229,"Purchased new for 119.95. After 6 months it started to leak everytime it brewed from the bottom. I called Krups, and they refused to do anything, even though It is suppose to have a year warranty. According to the numbers on the bottom it was made 2.5 years ago, and that's what they are going to use as date of purchase. Very poor customer service. Don't buy Krups."
1,Broken after 3 months,"From day one I didn't like the coffee maker, but gave it a try and it broke after just a few months of use. I like the carafe, but the coffee does not come out as hot as I like, and my husband frequently reheats his cup in the microwave after adding a touch of milk. Coffee has to be ground finely to get decent strength. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone."
3,"nifty looking, but expensive","My wife and I have owned this coffee maker for 4 or 5 years and are generally pleased with it. It is very attractive and sylish. It makes very good coffee. The drip mechanism has a spring loaded valve so that you can pull the caraffe out while its brewing. It also has a timer so you can awaken to the smell of fresh coffee.There are some disavdantages to this model. One is the price, although you can spend a lot more on coffee makers if you want. The other is that the caraffe does not keep the coffee hot for very long. Even if you preheat the caraffe with hot tap water, the coffee will be luke warm after 2-3 hours. Unlike some other reviewers, we've never had any problems with leaks.I recently bought at Mr. Coffee Thermal Caraffe model for my office and I am very pleased with it. It was only $40, it has all the features of the Krups, and it keeps the coffee hot longer."
1,very disappointed,"Even preheating with boiling water, this thermal carafe does not keep coffee hot. After 2 hours just lukewarm. My inexpensive store carafe does a much better job. Coffee flavor good and I use a little less because of the aroma control. For the price, would not recommend."
4,Used it for customers for months,"I was first introduced to this at work, in our retail store, where we kept hot coffee for our clients. We didn't have problems with coffee spilling out of the spout, and neither did our clients. It seems simple, really: just pour the coffee. It kept the coffee hot for a long time, too. We would brew it in the back, and then just bring the stainless carafe out to the coffee/cookie area, where it sat on a marble table."
1,Yuck!,"Yes it's programmable, but so are lots of other cheaper models. The coffee is luke warm at best. What's the point of scheduling it to be ready when you wake up if it's not even hot? I could brew coffee in my cheaper thermos style machine before I went to bed, and it would be hotter than this piece of junk's coffee!"
3,Twice the coffee - half the flavor,After retiring my old Black and Decker thermal after many years of good service I plunked down $100 because the Krups was the right size and color and I only wanted a thermal for safety reasons. It uses twice the coffee as my old machine for the same number of cups and the taste is lousy compared to the coffee that came out of my 10 year old machine. So I am returning it. Don't waste your money on the name.
1,difficult to program,"The knob to select the setting looks the same on both ends. My husband and I could not tell if we set the dial to program or to brew. We figured out we were on the wrong setting when coffee started dripping when the timer should have been set.After programming the start time the directions say to switch the dial to ""auto"" . The coffee cup in the display is supposed to stop flashing. It never did. The carafe is difficult to remove from the stand. We were so frustrated with setting the timer we returned it without ever making cofffee!"
2,Calling Mr. Coffee,"Yes, the large size and programmable timer are convenient. No, the carafe doesn't keep the coffee hotter than cheaper models. Plus, it lacks a spout, which makes for messy pouring. Save your money. In this case, the name does NOT live up to the hype."
2,Not Happy,"I was giving up my Cuisinart Grind and Brew because it was a good machine, BUT very hard to clean and all....so I wanted another really good coffee maker...so I went with this KRUPS.The ONLY good thing I found with this coffee maker is that it does keep the coffee very, very hot. However, it is made with really cheap plastic; the lid to the pot screws on so you must take it off to fill it with water; when I poured it, it drips all over.You also are supposed to take the pot off the base of the coffee maker as soon as it's done brewing-this is just odd to me because I'm used to keeping it on the maker itself. I understand why they say to do it, so the lid shuts totally and the coffee stays hotter, but I didnt care for it.I'm returning this tomorrow.I have already ordered the new Melitta Grind and Brew off Amazon-hopfully it'll be much better!"
2,Broken Handle!,"I purchased this machine from Amazon a little over a year ago. It took some getting used to but then we were happy with it. The coffee is good and comes out hot although does not stay hot for too long. Yesterday, I went to pour my coffee and the handle snapped off the thermal carafe!!! Coffee spilled everywhere and thank goodness my 2 children were not in the kitchen! I called Krups about what I thought MUST be a defect and after reading the numbers on the bottom of the machine they said I was past the one year warrantee and would have to BUY another carafe for $65.00! Poor customer service. They just lost a customer."
1,NOT WORTH THE TIME OR MONEY,"I read the reviews, but I had to learn it myself. Krups is not worth the time or trouble. I added water to the reservoir as soon as I got the thing unpacked, and the water started leaking all over the counter from the bottom. I didn't even get to turn the thing on. I returned it immediately. Choose another brand."
1,Overpriced and Not Durable,"We bought this unit because the Gevalia one that came for free did not have a timer on it. Well this one broke under a year and the coffee wasn't even as good as the freebie one from Gevalia. Huge disappointment. The unit only brews half of what you put in. Considering the price on this, Krups ought to be ashamed of themselves for selling such a poor coffee maker."
1,Resevoir leaked water everywhere - not a good start,"I was expecting pretty good things from this coffee maker. My first unit (the white one) leaked water everywhere from the base, even around the electrical cord, when I filled the resevoir for the initial test run. Packed everything up and sent if back to Amazon.com for exchange. Hope this was one of the ""planned obsolescene"" models and the next unit performs better. We'll see..."
1,Three strikes and you're out!,"I'll try this machine one more time. On the first one, I set the clock, turned it on, and nothing. The second one actually worked on the first run through. The second run through, turned it on, nothing. Unbelievable. When I returned the first one to Macy's, I asked the salesman what else he recommended, and he said, ""Anything but Krups. We get this returned all the time."" I guess that about says it all. The one time it did work, I will say it did stay hot. It was 180 degees at brew time, and after six hours it was still 140 degrees. Keep in mind you need to remove the pot from the machine when it's done brewing. If you leave it in, the lid remains in an open position."
1,Joanne Campanile/Krups 229-46,"Sirs:This coffee maker does not perform well at all. The coffee does not stay hot very long in the thermal carafe asstated in the advertising, and in the instruction book. Within an hour, the coffee is lukewarm. I'm very disappointedfor the money it cost me. And to return it to Canada will be costly, not to mention the 20% restocking charge.Also, there is a sharp edge under the lip of the stainless thermal pot. I do not recommend this product.(...)"
4,be sure to warm the pot,before use...it keeps the coffe hotter...very nice to look at..i don't mind leaving it on the counter.
1,Steer Clear of this Piece of Crap,"This is a gorgeous-looking but ultimately expensive piece of crap. Unfortunately, I threw the box and packing materials out too soon and I'm out $120+. The hype about the aroma control is just that -- hype. It starts brewing immediately and when it does, the water starts dripping out of the bottom onto your kitchen counter as well as into the carafe. If you use the automatic timer, you will discover that half the water has leaked out of the machine before the timer kicks in to brew the coffee. The whole mechanism is made from extremely cheap plastic parts. I don't know how they have the nerve to charge this much for such a worthless item."
2,Terrible design!,"I bought this coffee maker because I had owned a Krups with timer for 8 years with no problems until the digital clock went funny. The strange set-up of the timer and switches didn't bother me because they were similar to my old one. My main beef with this pot is that it is nearly impossible to pour out of the carafe without dribbling all over! It has no lip. It's just a big jug with a round opening. The instructions tell you to turn the plastic top on it, but this doesn't seem to help any. I would not recommend this model given how ""much it costs""!"
3,Who wants to control the aroma of coffee?,"Personally I think the designers at Krups freaked out when they realized that their new coffeemaker ""trapped"" all of that great coffee smell inside the thermal carafe so some genius MBA type decided to make it a ""feature"" hence, ""aroma control"". That issue aside, it makes good coffee. I too have had the pour problems occasionally and I can't quite figure out what I'm doing wrong and if you overfill the machine it pours out a hole in the back that you don't discover until you realize that there's water everywhere, not cool. I wanted a thermal carafe and that part is good, the coffee seems fresher an hour after the brew cycle as it hasn't been sitting on a burner."
2,Would not buy again.,"It doesn't make hot enough coffee. While it's a good temperature for drinking quickly, it gets cold too fast. You could probably remedy that by pre-warming the carafe, but that would negate using the timer, and, after it's warmed, you'd have to use a different container for filling your coffee maker or you'd cool the carafe down all over again.Worse, the carafe doesn't pour well. When you get to the last two or three cups, you have to be careful or coffee goes all over your counter top. The way it's designed, you can't even see the coffee pouring all over your counter top until it's too late. At 6:00 in the morning, sleepy and desperate to wake up and get ready for work, you don't want to think about how to hold the carafe ""just right.""What were they thinking? At such a HIGH price, I expect quality in the details. The Krups Aroma Control (at least with the steel thermal carafe) doesn't meet that standard."
3,It's not really porn... is it?,"This is the kind of erotica you watch when you need to be able to excuse it to yourself. It's got a nice plot, action and suspense, and some quality acting. A nice variety of girls, and the photoshoots provide lots of different locales and types of clothing (or lack thereof)."
5,My daughter is now a Chef!,Since watching this dvd my daughter is now thinking she's a chef. It's so wonderful because she was already helpful in the kitchen and now she's even more helpful! I love how it teaches responsibility while in the kitchen and my daughter loves these clowns!
3,"Great idea/phone, but battery life is horrible","Picked up this phone for Christmas as I really liked the idea/concept of it. It hooks up via Bluetooth to my Apple iPhone just fine and works as advertised as I can receive and make calls through my cell instead of the land line.My problems with it:- Battery life: horrible. I had the phone like a month and my primary hand set no longer holds a charge for longer than a day or two- Ringer cannot be separated for land line and cell: My land line is unlisted and no one has the number. So if it rings, it's a marketer or some other undesirable that i do not wish to speak with. It would be GREAT if i could turn off the land line ringer but still have it work for the incoming cell phone calls.Other than those two issues, I love the phone"
1,Not Recommended,"The display on the base unit malfunctioned after about 3-4 months of light use. I'm still waiting for cust service to repair/replace the base unit and its been over 2 months, and they claim it will be another 14-21 business days at least.In all the years, we've had cordless phones by Panasonic, Sony, ATT, and never had a single problem with any of them.The features on this phone are nice. It's unique with it's cell phone link, but not worth the trouble in my opinion.Reliability is just not that good, given the competition. Not recommended (unless you're lucky enough to get a reliable one)."
1,GE DECT 6.0---go with a different brand!!,"Do not buy this product. It is riddled with problems. When it would ring we were unable to answer the phone, when you pushed talk it would cut off the caller. Additionally the base would keep resetting itself and we would loose everything. If you research this product online you will see many problems with this phone and apparently ge is no longer manufacturing phones.I returned this phone (the amazon seller was teriffic about it) and bought a DECT phone from Vtech. It works great and have not had one single problem. A great solution if you don't want to be running for multiple phones through your home."
4,Great Product - Cutting Edge,"I don't know why others are having so many problems, but after using this phone for four months I would rate it a strong 4 out of 5. It connects seemlessly with our two sony-ericsson cell phones each time we return to our home with them. Incoming and outgoing cell calls work flawlessly with any of our four remote handsets. Calls are clear and the speakerphone feature is loud and strong. It is new technology and I was surprised that GE seems to be ahead of their competitors with what I believe will be the next must-have device."
1,Worst Customer Care (GE Thomson) in History,"Purchased a 28128EE2 and a 28101EE1 in Sep 2007. With in 3 months these products had failed. Contacted ThomsonGE many times until RMA was allowed in March 2008. It took until June 2008 to get the product replaced. They told me that only the improved and new version was available the 28129EF2. I agreed. The new product worked well but the additional handset finally arrived in July but it was a 28101EE1 which only worked with the original system. I called to explain that the phone which worked with the 28129EF2 was the 28101EF1 not the 28101EE1. They told me I was incorrect and sent me another 28101EE1 which again would not work. It is Sep 14 2008 and the issue still has not been resolved. MThompson, MD"
4,GE Phone,"Got this one for christmas,at that time it was $42.00 at amazon with free shipping.all I wanted was a good phone with answering machine, I looked at allot of phone and for this price and features, it can't be beat"
3,Not a Cell Answering Machine,"Have been using the 2-handset with Answering machine for a week now. The Bluetooth pairing was easy, along with most other functions. We have no land-line,and my only gripe for now is that the answering machine will NOT answer the cell phone and take a message. I phoned customer support and confirmed it. It's too bad there aren't more options for good prices on the market. Hopefully it will work for a few months, based on reviews stating the products poor quality."
4,Easy Set Up - Good Voice Quality,"Happy with this GE cordless phone purchase even though I feel it was overpriced and only comes standard with one additional handset. Phone has many useful features. For instance, it links with bluetooth devices; cell phones. Voice quality is exceptionally clear and distance signal strength is also very good."
1,Works,"It works, but that's the only thing good I can say about it. I got it because they claimed you could add extra handsets. HA! You can't! I've gone through 2 and still the only handsets it will recognize are the ones that came in the box with it. If you only need 2 handsets and want to link your cell via bluetooth, it's a okay phone. But don't get it thinking you can add extra handsets because you can't."
2,It was great until it broke.,"All of the reviews are correct, it works great until it breaks. (Ours worked for about 4 months before it started acting up) Then all customer support will do is tell you to reset the phone or send it back in. That is after calling 4 different numbers (don't bother with the number listed in the manual unless you want to spend all day in menus).to save you some time the correct # to call to speak to a person (as of today anyway) is 1-310-953-0113don't bother with this phone unless you want keep sending it back for returns."
1,Not What they say,We purchased this item for our Rock Texas Hill Country home. It works within a few of the interior rooms but as soon as we walk out the door it begins to get static and if we step off either the front or back porch it no longer gets reception.The base unit would not register batteries and after a long wait for tech support I found out that there is a known problem with Duracell batteries.We are returning the units and going back to the old portable phones which work much better at our home.
1,Do not buy - GE no more makes/supports these phones.......,"I bought this phone considering the features. I always heard static while using the handset. Its been slightly over a year, just out of warranty and the phone died on me. The base is completely dead, the customer service person informed that GE stopped making these phones and even if the phone was under warranty they would just pay me the current value of the phone... so be aware of the fact that you are buying something that doesnt have any kind of support. My $$$.$$ are in the dumpster..... good luck"
5,Works great,I was worried about the bad reviews but the great price made me give it a try. I figured the problem might be that it has to be set up correct. I got it because I am getting rid of my land line and the Bluetooth feature that links my cell to this phone does the trick. Works great..follow and understand instructions. Keep cell at least 10 feet away from base.After a few weeks I bought extra handset after I realized everthing was working great. Have had zero problems!!Have two cell phones linked to base..they auto connect to base when in range..about 30 feet. phone rings and it tells you what line is calling..good by land line.
1,Worst phone ever and useless customer service,"Don't buy this product!!! It causes more problems than having no phone.I, too have purchased this phone and have had very bad experiences with it. I have had three problems. First is when I receive a call, when I answer the receiver, but have no sound. Second, is where I make a call, but get no dial tone before the phone dials out. Even though I got no dial tone the call went thru. The strangest problem is when the phone decides to call someone on its own. Being connected thru Bluetooth to my cell phone allows this model to just call someone on its own, then ring the GE handset, both parties thinking that they have been called by the other.Dealing with customer service is a total waste. They don't even know the instruction manual and you cannot get to speak to anyone who is familiar with the product itself. Don't buy this product!"
4,Better than the Motorola C51 series,"I had purchased the Motorola C51 series cause I wanted to use my cell as the home phone. That system kept dropping the cell call about 2-5 minutes into the call. I have since replaced that system with this one and there are no issues. The handsets work great with the bluetooth and calls are clear. Although I haven't figured out how to get the answering machine to pickup the cell calls. I would like to use this feature cause this cell phone is used only at home (2nd line on the family plan). The other issue is the talk button works for the land line and you have to use the soft button for answering cell calls, haven't figured out how to answer the cell call once you pressed talk to the land line (which I don't have). Over all great item for the price."
2,"nice features but has problems, regret purchase","The phone has lots of nice features but it's a dud. I have experienced the same defect in all 3 handsets I bought as mentioned by another reviewer - which is that randomly I am unable to hear the other end of the call, even though the call has gone through. This goes for both outgoing and incoming calls. I sent all 3 handsets and the base unit to El Paso for replacement under warranty but I don't have high hopes. It's now 4 weeks and I've never even heard from them to acknowledge receipt of over $250 of electronics. In addition now I have no phones and no answering machine! When I called to check on the items, all the CS rep did was look on the USPS website to confirm delivery (which I had already done). He had no internal data about whether or not someone was actuall working on my problem. Don't go here!"
1,GE dect 6.0 cell fusion,"I purchased this phone 2 days ago. It has not worked well.1. when using my cell phone line and talking on the handset callers complain that the last part of my word is cut off.2. At times when I go to use the handset there is no dial tone. I have to go to the base unit and push the speaker phone button and get a dial tone. After doing this I then am able to get a dial tone on my handsets.3. Started having problems with cell phones going through the headsets. So I took them off and tried to put them back on and the phone will not let me. It shows no cell phones on the base but it will not connect any. My cell phones recognize the GE phone but not vice versa.4. I have had to reset the base unit two times, but even this does not help clear all of there problems up.5. At times the phone echoes in my ear.Back to the store this will go. I'm getting my money back!"
5,"Len Tukwilla, Driftwood Sculptor","Emphasizing textured noise and synth sounds, this album recalls many styles and bands like early Seefeel, Sound Track, Casino v. Japan, Autechre or other bands that lend themselves to easy name dropping. But in many ways, low light dreams is much more accessible than you'd expect--several tracks feel almost hummable before they slip back into washes of abstraction and white noise, and virtually all of these traacks retain the framework-if not necesarily the fine details--of traditional harmonies. Sometimes, I think of this album as a gestalt experiment, where pieces of the puzzle are presented for you to arrange into the ambience of your daily life.When I play this during my day job as a high-powered orthodontist, my patients go wild. Be forewarned. Be very forewarned."
5,Tell Hell I'm not coming!,"This play was very encouraging, funny, and insightful. I've watched it about three times and I just got it in the mail. I have a list of friends ready to watch it and I'm going to be ordering more for gifts. Anybody will be able to relate to this play and every Christian should watch it b/c of all the messages! I loved the church scences b/c this what happens in many of the churches......wow!"
4,Leaf Vacuum,So far it has been too wet here to really check out the leaf vacuum but I have tried it out and it appears to work just like it is supposed to. I know my neighbors will appreciate not having my leafs blow over to their yard.
4,"Great Blower for the price, vacuum feature needs work.","This was a great blower for the price. It beats sweeping the sidewalk after trimming and edging it, saves me so much time. It's not to particularly strong, but it gets the job done...so unless you're pushing a ton of leaves - it should be no problem at all. The vacuum feature isn't that great, I would stay away from using it if possible since the whatever you are vacuuming goes through the fan and gets crushed up...then when you empty it if the pieces are dry then they scatter all over and its dust is everywhere. Much easier to just sweep it up. I was surprised that this came with so much, it has everything you need to get the sidewalks nice and clean."
5,A Real Blowhard!,"The Toro Rake and Vac 10.5 Amp Electric Blower/Vacuum #51573 is the answer to clearing away all the leaves that collect where they are the most difficult to remove - on, in, under and around shrubs, and on landscaping stone and mulch. Grass clippings, stray stones and any other of Mother Nature's unwanted debris are easily disposed of. I was surprised by how powerful the Toro is. What a time saver to use the Toro versus manually raking and sweeping! Great rake, vacuum and price is a winning combination in my book. We bought the Toro blower as a Christmas gift for our son-in-law. He thinks it's terrific. I am very satisfied with both the leaf blower and with Amazon. ~ The Boss"
4,My appraisal of Toro Blower/Vac 10.5,"I shopped around, evaluated and priced five (5) differant brands of leaf blowers. Idecided to settle on Toro Blower/Vac, 10.5. Upon receiving product and using it; I like it very much. It is easy to use, easy to handle and easy to change from blower to vacuum and back to blower. The complete process f purchase from AMAZON was convenient and satisfactory. I will go to AMAZON for future purchases."
3,great for light jobs,"If your lawn has a few dry leaves that need to be cleaned up, this works great. The mulching tool took a LONG time to use, but it was nice to use the leaves as winter mulch in the garden. When our trees dropped all of their leaves, and we used this tool, it wasn't so great. It wasn't meant to create huge mounds of leaves."
4,"powerful blower, OK vacuum","The blower is quite powerful and works well. The vacuum does OK, but not as powerful as I expected. Also the connection tubes for vacuum is easy to fall off. But, Overall, it works great for a small to medium size yard."
1,Didn't work right out of the box.,"I'm returning this machine. After trying four different extention cords, all of which work, I give up."
4,Best Book Forward,"Have you ever been a great influence to your little brother or sister and then did something horrible right in front of them? Probably not, but in Best Foot Forward , by Joan Bauer, Tanner taught his little brother Webster how to read, write, and count. But then Tanner stole a pair of shoes from a shoe store right in front of Webster. He starts to work at the store he stole from to make up for what he has done. Maybe he just became his father for a little while, like the Incredible Hulk or Dr. Jekle and Mr. Hide, or maybe he is a real thief? (another thing to think about.) Jenna ,a girl who also works at the shoe store, helps him realize what's going on. Will he steal again, or will he become the best brother ever again. Do you think he will put his best foot forward? Read the book to find out."
3,"good, but....","j is back in a good way and in a bad way. again, the dialog is snappy, the main character is fun and witty and likeable. however, the issues are huge and therin lies the problem. bauer tries to tackle an alcohalic parent, a (maybe) annorexic sibling, a grandmother with alzheimer's disease, a thieving co-worker, the issue of unethical overseas labor tactics and the maturing of her main character all at the same time. the book treads on all of these issues but fails to tackle them realistically. the theiving co-worker for instance does not feel like a real teenager. in fact, he comes accross almost as an idiot...i could have pulled off a better scam than that guy:) anyway, it IS still a fun read, just don't look for any realness in it."
1,Should be zero stars,"Gail Riplinger, one of the ""leaders"" in the King James Only movement has been thoroughly discredited by evangelical scholars due to her sloppy scholarship and truly abyssmal use of ""citations"". She has no experience in the original languages, and while she does indeed teach on the college level, her teaching is in the field of FINE ARTS -- and NOT THEOLOGY!To call her positions heterodox would be generous. Give this one a miss."
4,scopes,"Just recieved this scope bore sighted on the range at fifty yards !!! Seven shots later dead on the money my son who is ten put two in the bulleyes range with an 06,great scope compared it to my brothers bushnell hands down alpen beat em out good quality great picture very clear. Go alpen optics."
4,I Like it!,"Fitness has always been great. I've read it for at least 5 years and love the articles, especially Q & A. It's worth the money........... However, watch their billing dept. Once, I didn't renew, they threatened to send me to collections, stating that they had sent me the magazine for 6 months (they did not)prior and I had to fight it. Anyway, they couldn't provide proof and fixed the problem, so I'm back to buying Fitness AND considering another subscription through Amazon!"
2,BORING!,"I couldn't wait for my subscription to end. I started out reading each issue from cover to cover because the fitness tips are really good. After a few issues, though, I got so bored with the content and no longer felt inspired to workout. I haven't bothered to read the last three issues. Plus, the covers with the super skinny models wearing flimsy bikinis really started to annoy me after a while. I was embarrassed to leave the magazine lying around the house!I just picked up an issue of Self at the drugstore and I think I will get a subscription. I found that one issue really inspirational, with good fitness advice and other interesting articles."
1,Not worth the time,"I was not impressed with this magazine, which is supposed to be dedicated to fitness, as the title would suggest... It does have fitness-related articles in it, but also has a mixing of articles on the correct way to apply make-up, fashion ideas and trends, etc. If I wanted Glamour or Cosmopolitan, I would have bought them."
2,Kinda Thin; Didn't have much for exercises,I was hoping for at least 3-4 pages/spreads with exercises.The issue (October) I received most recently only had 1 set of exercises--all with a chair.I wish they had an 'article' with dumbbell exercises and another with say no equipment; in addition to the chair.It's not like I want to crawl up on a chair for my next month of exercise. I was disappointed.Not many good sections on sweet workout gear either.
2,They need to work on this magazine,There was no meat to this magazine. Way too many ads and useless tid bits. Many of them we have heard. Nothing good to read.
2,used to be,This magazine used to be better like 10 years ago. It had better weightloss success stories. Now its just small boring sentences. What happened Fitness?
5,Best women's magazine out there,"This is a great magazine for women that never gets too shallow, political or ridiculous. Great recipes, good work out suggestions, inspiring stories-- nice advice sections-- all around good magazine."
1,Don't subscribe to this if you're in a hurry to receive it....,"My comments are not about the magazine itself and more about the publisher. I bought this 2-year subscription from Meredith Publishing on Amazon on June 14th. It is now almost 3 months later and I have yet to receive a single copy of it! I contacted the publisher email address and get a bunch of automated replies with no real help or answers to my questions. The last automated email said ""We are extending your subscription to compensate for the inconvenience you experienced. Please allow six to eight weeks for the change in your expiration date to appear on your address label"". At this point, I am not even sure where to go to receive a refund.I wouldn't recommend ordering from if you want to receive your magazine any time soon....."
3,More fluff than needed,"With the name ""Fitness"" I expected a more excercise and workout centered magazine, but that's really not the case. It's not a bad magazine by no means, but if you're looking for something that focuses on working out and excercising, you'll want to look more into something like ""Oxygen"". There's also too much ""fluff stuff"" that didn't interest me like fashion and make up stuff. Also could use more healthy eating recipes. This magazine is a lot like Self and Shape; if you like those, you'll like Fitness."
4,Fitness Rocks,"Glad to find a magazine that includes advice you can actually follow! Also, I love the exercise cards that you can tear out! I am putting mine in a binder!"
1,How many magazines did I NOT get....,"I got a 1-year subscription to this magazine last year..... so far, I have only received three magazines! I thought I would be getting 10 but I have yet to see them. They already sent me a renewal package.... Which I will not be renewing because I have not found anything amazing in this magazine! Wish they were more fitness oriented and actually sent out magazines!"
5,Great fitness mag.,This magazine is great. Lots of fitness and health tips geared towards women. It also features fashion and makeup trends. I enjoy looking at it each month. Its a well balanced magazine with good articles and fitness pictures with descriptions.
4,Great Magazine,"I love this magazine and I am happy that I bought a subscription. Each issue has great workouts, and health information. There is a lot of ads, but that is every magazine. overall I would recommend it to anyone who likes working out and being healthy."
2,Over 75% are ads,"I subscribe for 2 years due to very low price and the name ""Fitness"" but I am very disappointed. You can see about 10-15% for actual fitness, most workouts are similar to each others."
5,I love Fitness,"I get bored easily working out, so I especially like how Fitness suggests new workouts every month. Fitness also keeps me up to date on what's going on in women's health and, more importantly, how to tell the difference between a fad diet and what really works. I'm in my 30s, but Fitness is perfect for all women who care about their health, from teenagers to senior citizens. I've read all the other exercise/health magazines, and there isn't any other magazine like Fitness."
4,Inspiring!,"When the publishers of my all-time favorite women's fitness magazine (Muscle & Fitness Hers) decided to stop producing it, I had to find a suitable alternative. While it's not as ""meaty"" as Muscle & Fitness Hers, it's a good, inspiring read. It devotes too much space to fluffy stuff like clothing and makeup (and ug, even a few celebrities), but overall I would recommend it...at least until something better comes along!"
3,Too much fluff,"There are many excellent fitness tips and routines in ""Fitness."" Unfortunately, the magazine is also jam-packed with fluff pieces about make-up, purfume, and fashion. While the magazine tries to relay the message that fitness is about health, not how you look, they put a large emphasis on beauty."
3,Not sure it's worth the wait,I finally get my magazine 4 months after I pay for it when I thought it would just take a couple weeks. The articles are good but then again there are a lot of advertisements.
2,Mediocre at best,"I would like to give this somewhere between 2.5 and 2.8, as it's not quite a 3, but oh well.Like other reviewers have said, there are a lot of fluff pieces in this magazine. There are some decent fitness and nutrition articles, but I always feel like I'm hearing the same-old, same-old every time I read this. Newbies to fitness and nutrition/health probably would benefit most from this magazine, but if you are a serious fitness buff everything probably will all seem like old news to you. A lot of the issues are very similar to each other month to month, also, and within a year's subscription there's not much deviation in stories. After finishing an issue, I usually end up feeling like there could have been so much more offered to the readers, and it's almost always very mediocre."
2,Jam packed,"This magazine is jam packed with....ads. I understand magazines have ads, but this just seems like overkill. Almost every other page is an advertisement, and I feel like the articles aren't that special either. A quick, targeted, Google search and I could have all of this information at my fingertips. Very disappointed."
2,not my taste,cancelled my subscription... didn't really enjoy and had a bunch more advertisements than i had patience for !!!!.. flipping pages and pages of that is not for me
3,to little helpful tips and to many advertisements,The magazine did have about two seperate sections with actual tips on how to workout effectively. However most of the magazine was filled useless advertisements and pictures of models that were not fit but naturally skinny.
1,Paid in July - End of September no magazine yet!,"My rating is a service rating. This is the longest I have waited for a subscription to begin. From paying in July, I would expect a note from them acknowledging my subscription. It is almost midnight Sept. 24 and nothing!"
1,little depth,"I read this in about 3 hours. Concept ok but little development. Disappointing end. Stopped short of there being a real story. Take a pass on this one and read ""Alas, Babylon""."
4,Often Overlooked Kander and Ebb Show Glitters,"This recording is a very good representation of the show. Though I miss Chita, the girls hold their own very well. The men do a fine job as the Wrecker ensemble. The music itself is highly underrated. Songs range from emotion driven ballads (""All the Children In A Row""), to mid tempo standards (""Colored Lights""), to high spirited cabaret numbers (""Chief Cook and Bottle Washer""). Shows hints of both the previous show Chicago and the upcoming Kiss of the Spider Woman. A wonderful show to hear, an impressive show to see, and an incredible show to perform in. If you enjoy Kander and Ebb's style, ignore the naysayers and give The Rink a well-deserved shot."
4,Find the Chita/Liza recording!,This is an excellent recording because it contains some dance music that was not recorded in the broadway album. It nevertheless is missing Chita Rivera and Liza Minnelli. This show was written for Ms. Rivera and every song she sings she makes her own.
5,AmAzing..the pAper chAse hAve done it AgAin,"First, off pAper chAse is amazing...I'm way late for writing a review on this album, considering their next amazing album is going to be released a month after I write this. Anyways...this cd is has every element you need. Scary, weird, fun...laced with brilliant tallent. GO see their show. I've seen in 7 times. It's seriously an addiction for myself, A pAper chAse cult member."
2,"I'm trying to give it a chance, but.....","First, trust me when I say that I listen to music that is comparable in genre and feel to this album. I bought it a couple of weeks ago, and I've been listening to it off and on, trying to like it. However, the parts of this album that should feel like you're experiencing a burst of raw emotion just feel entirely too contrived. It's as though Congleton tried to make his music as repulsively dissident as Chris Carrabba makes his pretty. The desired effect? To epitomize his music within the genre. Every musician does it, but if you want something that can AT LEAST trick you into believing the singer is as big an emotional and social wreck as he pretends to be, I suggest you surf on over to Bright Eyes."
1,DON'T BOTHER!,"I am a beginner, learning with a friend, we watched the tape - this was our first exposure to bellydancing (what a shame). Her warm-up is very quick, once she teaches you a ""move"", she doesn't practice with you enough before she goes onto the next movement. We had a hard time following the routine since it scrolled down very quickly onto the screen. We were very confused the first time we watched it. Then you endure the horrible 10 minute intro from ""Eddie"" and her 10 minute ""performance"" at the end of the tape. We are currently on the search for a BETTER tape."
1,I threw it away,"When I purchased this tape years ago, I had no experience bellydancing. Even with NO knowledge of the basics or correct form I thought she was a terrible dancer and instructor. I threw it in the trash. I have since given bellydance another shot with the Dolphina, Neena & Veena, & Shamira videos and now LOVE it.This tape is just bad all the way around. Skip it."
1,Belly Dance for fun and fitness,"I was disappointed with this video. I've taken belly dance classesfor about a year now and wanted a video I could practice what I learned with. Well, Janine is a very good dancer but not a verygood intructor. She rushes through the warm up and routines sofast that I had a hard time following her.Most of the tape isher performing at the end with is longer then the intructionpart!"
1,Terrible video for beginners,"If this is the first exposure a beginning dancer has to bellydance, she will spend YEARS learning to undo all the bad habits and mistakes this video will teach her. The reviews who gave this 2 and 3 stars have obviously never taken a REAL bellydance class or seen a performance, because what this woman does is certainly not bellydance.Please don't waste your money or your effort trying to learn from this tape. Go to shira.com for reviews of proper bellydance instructional videos."
2,Very amateurish,"It's obvious that Ms. Rabbit enjoys dancing, but this video is not one of the better belly dancing videos on the market. It is basically a home video of her doing a few awkward dance moves and her husband praising her. It is so amateurishly made that I was embarrassed for them as they seem like very nice people. I think they should have made this for their personal collection and not attempted to market it to the public."
1,"Bad, Bad, Bad!",I too was excited at the premise of a beginner belly dance video for home use but was very disappointed with the Janine Rabbit video. I was so upset that I returned it for a refund because of the inaccuracy and potentially harmful 'fitness' lessons shown on the tape. Obviously this is a home video put out for sale. Just because one has had access to a few classes and has a partner/spouse to pay for the processing costs of a video does not mean that one should put out a video. This was a huge mistake and I hope that no one will purchase this horrible video! You will learn more from little video clips on MTV than you will here! I would give this a rating of 0 stars! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS!
2,Don't waste your money on this one!,"This video would be laughable, except that in many libraries, etc. it is the *only* bellydance video available; it does NOT represent this dance form well! Rabbitt is well-intentioned, but is only a mediocre dancer and much of her history is inaccurate.In a recent conversation on videos on med-dance (an email discussion group composed of Middle Eastern dancers, musicians, and aficionados), this one ranked at the bottom. I would have given it a ranking of ""1"" except that at least it has decent production values and she's not wearing a stripper-esque costume. END"
1,IT WAS SO IDIOTIC I DIDN'T EVEN LAUGH,I am Arabic and I brought this tape to have a routine (keeping in mind i already know how to belly dance from family in the middle east ) when I watched the tape it was not even right she had it all wrong and she stunk at it . If you are considering buying this tape DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY .
1,video from a not so good dancer,"I bought this tape when i was a begginer dancer and the only thing i have learned from this was the basic zills rythm otherwise do not follow her instructions because she can't isolate anything and she is swaying all over the place in all her moves. It costs too much for a poor instruction video and poor performances ,you should spend your money somewhere else."
1,Shimmy away from this one!,Please don't make the mistake I did and buy this one. This was my first video on belly dancing and it was very disappointing. I force myself to watch it. I do recommend the Bellydance: Fitness Workout for Beginners series instead.
1,so terrible it is funny,"we show this one at dancer parties for a laugh. The technique is terrible - anyone trying moves as she recommends may well get hurt. Although she obviously enjoys dancing, Janine was just not ready to teach or perform."
1,The worst bellydance video ever,"This is the worst bellydance video I have ever seen, and I have seen a lot of them. She should owe us stars for putting out such a horrible video. She is a horrible dancer, and a worse teacher. Her moves are as graceful as an elephant trying to do ballet. If this was the only bellydance video I had ever seen, I never would had started bellydancing. Don't waste your time on this video, keep looking. Try Jillina, Amira Mor, Belly Twins, Michelle Joyce or Temple of Jehan."
2,The Harry Dent we all love waste our time in this book.,"I have read most of the books Harry Dent has authored. If you have never read Harry Dent's books you may love this book. For those of us looking for new knowledge, it was not to be had in this book. The reason why is frightening. Harry Dent pandered to the brokerage community who pays him royally to speak to them. There is no specific advice because the brokerage community wants to pick the stocks. Harry could have easily told us how to invest on our own with great tech and financial stocks, and index spiders offered on the AMEX. Unless Harry's next book declares on the cover that he is giving specific information, I will never buy another book authored by Harry Dent. We already know how long to invest in U.S. stocks, and when to invest more in Asia and other countries. Harry told us that two books ago."
5,Use the strategies in this book,"Harry S. Dent is an optimistic visionary that uses simple techniques to explain historical data and how it relates to potential future events. He mistrusts modern economists ,who he believes are over-analytical, and contrives a simple plan to assist all laymen (or the ""average Joe"" like myself). There is a bit of fluff regarding tax planning and obtaining a financial advisor which is more suitable for those with substantial capital (not in that group, YET). Read this book and start a mutual fund with some of your savings and have faith and prosper! I personally have started a global technology fund, if any of you were interested."
1,A poor sequel,"Harry Dent's latest is rather a poor sequel. He brushes over issues covered in his prior books and sheds a bit more light on the international investment arena.One chapter turned out quite preachy where Dent, while describing the importance of having the financial freedom to do the things we like, preaches forever on the goodness of giving. And to top it all off, Dent presents and pretends to prove the statement that changes in tax laws have no effect on the desire to innovate! Skip this book and buy one of his prior ones instead!"
1,"Avoid! Try Sy Harding's ""Riding the Bear""","This book was never needed, it is rehash of the now thoroughly disgraced clap-trap Dent had in his earlier book about the roaring 2000s. So relentlessly wrong it is funny. Read Sy Harding's ""Riding the Bear"" and Charles Caes' ""Tools of the Bear"" to make easy money quick in this bear market that will last for years to come. Dent was merely a good salesman. This book's strategies will financially ruin you!"
3,Try to separate the wheat from the chaff.,"Despite the author's wrongheaded notions about the origin of inflation (for the record, inflation is caused by hyperactive government printing presses--NOT by the emergence of new technologies) and the advice to seek therapy for our ""inevitable"" midlife crises, Dent presents a useful analysis of upcoming demographic trends and their likely implications for the financial markets over the next decades. He does seem, though, to ignore the likelihood that the rapid advances in technology over the past twenty years will eventually change the spending habits (as a function of age) of the populace."
1,"""WHERE'S THE BEEF?""","The book panders to popular sentiment without going thru the work of defending his conclusions. Mr. Dent clearly lacks the depth and breadth of understanding of his subject matter. He appears to merely want to sell books with catchy titles. Remember the old Wendy's commercial: ""where's the beef?"". Don't waste your time or money on this book I wish I hadn't."
3,Not what I was looking for.,I was looking for a good introductory text to Fourier series and transforms. There are some nicely worked out problems and proofs but this is definitely not an introductory text. For free you can watch Osgood's lectures on Fourier Analysis from Stanford Engineering on You-Tube. The lecture notes are also available as a download from the Stanford website. Please save your money and start there.
4,Good study aid!,"Very helpful to me in my medical imaging and signal processing assignments! A good buy for any student of engineering or science, particuarly useful to the study of signal analysis."
4,Step-by-step explanations,"This text is a good supplement to understanding the use of Fourier analysis and how it is used in real-world applications. The explanations are to the point and the solved problems are all fairly easy to follow.At the end of the chapter, there are exercises to test your knowledge, and most of the answers are in the back of the book. Modeling the exercises on the problems, you can usually work out what you should do for the exercise.This is a good study guide."
3,Several exercises,"This book have a several exercises.IF you prepare a test, i recommend you purchase this book"
2,Not Impressed,"Beings that I live in a remote area where there is NOT a lot of availability to this type of food or spices, I tried going with these mixes for my Indian dinner party. I have been disappointed with pretty much every one I have tested.Instead of these Parampara mixes, try to find Shan mixes. I am soooooo thankful to the Pakistani lady who turned me on to them. They are perfect for recreating an authentic Indian/Pakistani meal. Just like these Parampara mixes, all you do is add the meat and or vegetables, oil, etc. to the spice mix. The complete directions are printed in english on the back of the box. They have the perfect spice blend and heat. I can only highly recommend the Shan: Chappli Kabab! I grilled my patties out on the grill and served them with Naan, lettuce leaves, and a cool cucumber raita. And Dal Curry for a side. Mmmmm, totally yummy!"
1,Infidel Defilers,"What a waste for a band with such potential to be putting out the wrong message. Christianity has NO PLACE in Black/Death metal, it's oxymoronic to say the least."
3,so so cleaning,"It did a so so job, it did not clean all the build up, I did the clean up twice, there are still some old build up left."
2,Expensive citric acid,This is just citric acid. 1oz of citric acid for 2 bucks?? - You can get citric acid at a cheaper price elsewhere!
5,Work like a charm,"I would recommend it to everyone who uses the hot water dispenser. It's very easy to use. Even if you don't see any scald build up, give it a try and you will not believe what is there. You will need one package per one liter size of pot. I only has the stubborn scald at the bottom of the pot so I figure I can put one liter of water just to cover the problem area and only use one package of powder. After the cleansing process is done, the bottom of the pot is cleaned just like the first day I got them. I then spot the ring where the water level was and realized how dirty the rest of the pot actually is. Invisible scald, I would call them. Anyway, I ended up using the rest of cleansing powder for the second cleansing batch. I'm using the pot to boil water for the baby formular. It's important that it's kept clean. This product delivers the result I hope for."
5,Excellent cleaner,I've just cleaned the Zojirushi boiler for the first time in the three months since purchasing it and the results were excellent. I did check with customer service first because the instructions in the manual and on the ADC-05 cleaner package are conflicting. The package says to use one pack per liter of water and since it is a 4 liter boiler that seemed like a lot of cleaner. Customer service said to disregard that information and follow the instructions in the manual which says to use just one pack of cleaner.
5,should've bought this a long time ago,i absolutely LOVE my Zojirushi air pot. i've had it for 5 years now. i had noticed that it wasn't pumping as well as it used to (4 or 5 vs. 1 or 2)and that the buildup on the inside wasn't exactly easy to scrub off. but this pot cleaner works SO WELL. just make a pot of water and hit the cleaning button and it does the rest! So easy and it makes my pot dispense like new!
3,An Inexpensive Alternative,"Although pricy, I purchased Zojirushi's electric water boiler cleaner and although very effective, there are less expensive alternatives.The ingredients packaged include 1. Citric acid (common in kitchen cleaning solutions and a 6% concentration will remove hard water stains from glass), 2. Sulfamic Acid (used as an acidic cleaning agent for metals and ceramics as well as a descaling agent for removing limescale), and 3. Aluminum Sulafate (used in water purification to coagulate impurities). Some automatic drip coffee pot cleaners also use the first two ingredients in their formulation, e.g., Dip It2.Of course, the above ingredients are used for many other purposes than those listed above; but, the use of only Citric Acid can be effective for most cleaning/descaling problems. Search on Amazon and you'll find prices that are quite economical. If you use only citric acid, write a review to tell about your experience."
3,"Not bad, but...","Yes, there are a variety of instruments and it's very listenable, but the actual melodies and vocal style is NOT remotely surprising. The songs all follow the usual pop formula, so I don't really think the comparison to artists like Pete Yorn is justified."
5,GREAT,"A great addition to the collection. Be sure to pick this one up today, features really great type examples! :)"
5,A Naturopathic Doctor's opinion,This book is well-written and well-researched. It presents a fair and balanced vies and provides much-needed information which is not regularly provided by medical doctors.
2,"Somewhat informative, poorly organized","While this book contains some good information, especially regarding alternative treatments and natural immune boosters, the way it was organized made for a confusing read. As a parent, I am not really interested in, or have the time to read an in depth dissertation on the history of disease and immune biology. And getting a comprehensive view of each vaccine requires reading small parts of many chapters. Also, it does not cover all the vaccines being given today and provided no information on alternative schedules."
5,Valuable resource,"I bought several vaccine books when our first child was born. This is the one I've kept. It has been such a great resource whenever we have a question about childhood diseases, treatments, and vaccines. Highly recommended, especially if you are considering an alternative vaccination schedule or limited/no vaccinations."
2,Not what I expected...,What your doctor may NOT tell you --- is a better book. I learned very little from this book; and I did not care for the way it was organized. Not a compelling read.
4,Lovable Boston Bulls,"This book is a definitive look at the Boston bull. Readers learn about this spirited little hybrid dog which is the result of crossing English bulldogs with small white terriers. The breed was developed in the Boston area.Good coverage is given to breeding; dental and overall health and the special care that pregnant Bostons require. Since Boston puppies have large heads, they are often delivered by Cesarean.As much as I enjoyed the drawings of this beautiful breed, I wish there had been some photographs as well. Bostons are beautiful, intelligent and alert little dogs who make excellent pets and are ideal for families. Bostons are highly social and crave interaction.This is a decent book, but it does leave readers wanting more. Still, it will appeal to those who own or just love the Boston bull."
3,Not as helpful as I had hoped,"I felt like I was reading a generic book on dogs, not on the Boston Breed. Although it was informative, it was a tad misleading because there wasn't a lot of information on having a Boston. I found other books and magazine much more informative and helpful."
3,A little dissapppointed.,"I liked this Walkman Armband Radio enough to buy a second one, but was disappointed in the statement about it being ""water resistant"". I walk every day and on one of those days it started raining. I kept walking and and the next morning I put it on to go walking it would not work. I was so disappointed that it had not really been ""water resistant"". I purchased another one and the next time it starts to rain, I will take it off and not let it get wet. It is truly not ""water resistant""."
2,Running,"Bought this to replace the older model that had distinct buttons for the radio stations. While it is easier to scroll through the programmed stations, you have to go through all of them to get to a station you want.The FM tuner is weak. What I mean by this is that the tuner has a hard time to pull in weak signals and it has a hard time preventing station crossover interference. Luckily, I have 3-4 stations that are acceptable to listen to while I jog. I unfortunately can not use the 15 presets due to not enough strong stations in my area.Best way to improve this unit would be to bolster the FM tuner.Price was ok."
1,Sony should be ashamed for this product,"This armband radio is very poor quality and Sony should be ashamed of itself for putting a product like this on the market to carry it's name. The FM Tuner is terrible and can barely pickup local FM stations. Noisey hard to tune and program. Not user friendly at all and part of it the TV tuner will be useless after February 17, 2009. Sony wake up and make something better than this. If you like to workout or walk and listen to the radio don't buy this product."
3,"Lightweight, but not as good as earlier Sony M80","I bought this to replace my earlier S2 Walkman. The previous one, model M80, was a bit heavier in weight and required two batteries (instead of one) but it had great radio reception and was easy to use. After four years I literally wore it out and was eager to get a new unit. The new M85V is lighter in weight -- which is nice -- but the radio reception isn't nearly as good, especially on FM stations with moderate to low signal strength. Major bummer since I live in a hilly area of California and radio reception is compromised by mountains, power lines, etc.I would only recommend the M85 if you plan on listening to radio stations with high wattage and very strong signals."
1,Complete waste of money,"I wish I would have read the other reviews for this product before I bought this Walkman. Complete waste of money. The radio gets bad reception even outside. Inside at the gym I tried to listen to the tv sound that is broadcast over FM, at first I thought the transmitters were not turned on because I received nothing but static. But no, the person next to me had a $19.99 radio with a brand name I never heard of was picking up the signal just fine. The Walkman that I had back in the 80's (plain AM/FM with a cassette player) got better reception than this. It is completely worthless to me. I suggest you look for another brand."
1,This is terrible!,"This has the worst reception and sound I ever heard. After misplacing my Aiwa ld-cr121 radio - which was incredible, I picked up this Sony. Besides the horrible reception the clip for the arm band blows and falls when I'm running.Don't bother looking for the Aiwa it as small as a lighter - sound and reception was incredible. So, Sony bought Aiwa and that was the end of that. Sony has become terribly disappointing and I will really think twice about buying a sony again."
1,Forget this one,We have purchased this radio twice over the last couple of years. The first one worked great but the second one had awful static as you walked and became worse as your paced increase. Service is slow and non-responsive.
1,"Design is good, but the RECEPTION IS TERRIBLE.","I couldn't believe how bad the reception was on this Sony product, especially on the low-end of FM band. I thought maybe it was the headphones, so I tried a bunch of different ones. I also tried it out in all areas of town with no success, so I returned it to Best Buy."
1,Terrible,"I bougth a Sony SRF V walkman, with TV reception and more expensive ( US 63.00 ) and received an Sony W , without TV reception ( about US 32.00).Suplier said that product is no longer available and I need to pay for packaging and mail to return."
1,Don't buy this radio!!,"I have recently used the Sony SRF-M85V S2 arm band radio...as soon as I got home from my walk, I found all the packaging it came in, packed it all back up and sent it back. The reception is HORRIBLE, it is even worse than horrible. I live in an area where reception is never a problem, but when on my walk, I was lucky if I had a total of 60 seconds of clear reception. There is a button for local versus further away stations, that made no difference in the reception. Maybe if you were standing in the lobby of the radio station would you be able to actually tune it in. I have had much cheaper radios that worked far better than this one. The only good thing I can say about this product is that I really l liked the armband."
1,Bozo Sony Decision,"The previous Sony S2, model SRF-M80V had two AAA batteries. This one , model SRF-M85V, has only one. I presume this is the reason for the terrible FM reception. Hay Sony, isn't the primary purpose of a radio to BE a radio?"
1,don't buy!,"I bought this radio and the FM reception is so bad, that I was actually looking directly at the tower of a 150w station, from less than a quarter of a mile away, and this thing could not receive that station AT ALL, tried my trusty old WMFS220 and it came in just fine on it."
1,Believe the negative reviews,"If after reading all the negative reviews you say-- ""This product can't possibly be this bad"" (like I did) well, you'd be wrong. Even the strongest FM stations that come in perfectly clearly with the cheapest throwaway radios are garbled, noisy, and static-y on this radio. This product is a blot on Sony's reputation."
1,Sony SRF-M85V S2 Sports Walkman,"I purchased the previous model M80v 3 times as I wore it out with daily use 10 hr a day @ work they lasted about 1 1/2 years to 3. This is honestly a piece of crap! I am working at the same office & same area. Many of my radio channels don't come in & some of the TV channels aren't clear; before all TV channels were crystal clear & only a few of my radio channels didn't come in clearly. While walking on the street the same, most of my radio or Tv channels come through with static. I went online with Sony, the help was truly poor, go to this website & do this ... didn't work. The small changes like 1 AAA battery instead of 2 may be part of the problem. A friend purchased it also & sent it back. I'm hoping Sony will change this Walkman up quickly. Again please don't waste your $$ on this version it's Sony's worst Walkman."
1,Please do not make the mistake of buying this item!!!,"You will be cheated. I bought this just so I could listen to TV sound while running. The Amazon promo says TV Band! When I got the thing, no TV reception!! I then discovered fine print buried in the packaging which says : 'after February17, 2009 this product will no longer receive television audio broadcasts'. Amazon sold me mine in February 2010, a year after it became obsoleteAmazon does not disclose this. False Advertising!!!"
4,Early Problems Fixed,"Sony must have fixed the problem of the radio that got no reception because this little wonder is fantastic. AM/FM reception is clear and it's in a nice, extremely lightweight (and pretty eye-turning) package.Only problem I have is the volume - a small ""wheel"" at the base of the radio - turns too easily if you clip the radio to your waist instead of using the arm band. It can get very loud or very soft in an instant, and the ""Hold"" switch doesn't help."
2,"Bad reception, terrible arm band.","I too have noticed bad reception in a metro area like other reviewers. I would like to add how bad the armband. This is my second Sony Walkman in 2 years. The second replaced my first because the metal in the armband rusted out and basically turned into rust dust that would stain my arm clothes during workouts. I used this to run outside but never in rain and both rusted out after a month or two. Of course, you can't replace the armband so you are forced to buy another player just because the arm band is no good. Needless to say I will be moving away from Sony for my next workout headset."
1,Sony Walkman Armband Radio,headphone cord is very thin. it broke in half -- Amazon quickly sent me a new radio -- but that one broke also. So I got a refund. Amazon sent me a postage paid label to return the radios.
1,Don't buy!,Reception horrible. Got as gift and never used. I feel terrible for putting on my wish list.
1,Horrible reception!,I purchased this headset to wear to the gym to tune into their TV's to watch programs rather than listen to music. Reception was horrible!!! While I was in the gym I tried just listening to the radio and couldn't even get that to come in clear. The only time it was partially clear was if you were standing outside and it was clear skies! Not impressed at all! I will be returning this and maybe buy the $12 generic set instead!
1,Feature Set is great but the FM is pure JUNK,Long periods of garbled static mixed with random brief moments of actual FM reception. This is in town trying to receive a major station. I am packaging this up and its going back today. This is my second try with Sony that has miserably failed. Guess maybe I should be looking at another mfg.
2,"Very funtional, but volume knob gets lost making item useless.","I had a Sony armband radio that I used at the gym for several years. I travel extensivly for business and use the radio several times a week. I felt that I got more than my share from this older radio but it gave up on me, so I bought a new one about 3 months ago. Sony has changed the unit- made it a bit smaller and redesigned it. Same basic funtionality, but updated sizing and buttons changed a bit. Had the new one for about 60 days and the volume knob fell off. Couldn't find the knob, so I ordered another- thinking it was just a fluke. Well, I've had the 2nd new one about 30 days and the knob has again come off. I have Ipod's, but I like to be able to tune to the tv in the gym when working out. Won't buy another one of these. Sound is good, funtionality is good (although setting up preset stations is not as user friendly as it could be). But without a volume knob, it is useless."
1,Don`t Buy !Please!,This radio is very bad ; in FM the radio reception is poor : What happended Sony?
1,Sony Radio,Reception of stations was terrible. Even though much less expensive radio had no problem picking up.
1,Worst reception ever,I would have to agree with the other review. This radio would not pick up any stations. My old yellow analog Sony was much better. Look elsewhere.
1,I don't understand why Sony sells this radio,"Terrible terrible terrible reception from 600 watt radio towers in Cleveland. e.g. WTAM, an am station, can be picked up farther than Columbus, is all static and pops. But then again, it's hard to tell if it's the bad reception or the ""how did this pass quality control"" style headphone input. Honestly, what are they smoking at Sony and where can I get some?"
4,review,"Good quality, good fit and finish, good price, good deal. It is very easy (and safe) to hang up your TV after you have fastened the strips of metal to the back of your TV (it is also very easy to take it off the wall for whatever needs you may have).Two words: Like it!"
3,Good for smaller tvs,"This is good for a smaller TV..my 42"" Viejo barely fits! It's on the limits of the two bars that it hangs off of and as it holds the weight fine I'm happy with it, and for the price..however, they should advertise that it is better to use not with a 42!"
2,missing hardware,"Product came with hardware missing. I had to contact manufacturer to reorder the package of bolts,screws etc. They were nice about my problem and were to send the hardware by UPS with no charge. The box should have been inspected before shipping."
4,Pretty good basic mount for the price,"This is the first flat panel wall mount I've installed. It was quite easy to install and includes all of the necessary hardware. The Sanus website even has a calculator to determine the right height to drill the holes, given you know the top, bottom, or middle TV. My only complaint is that the TV can easily slide sideways and there is no way to lock the horizontal position. FWIW, I used this on a 32"" TV (Sony KDL32EX308)."
5,Sanus Wall Mount,"Ordered with free shipping and was shocked that it was delivered the very next day. Turns out it was delivered from our own city (Las Vegas). Price was a just a bit more than 1/2 of store price (Best Buy & Target).Quality was first class but the instructions came in every language but ""English"". Fortunately it is so basic and simple that instructions weren't really needed anyways. Pretty much all assembled except for mounting on the wall of course.Be sure you have some spare lag screws as the bolts provided in the package are so large, to could mount a tank on the wall with them.Overall, very satisfied and we saved a lot of money."
2,You can't mount it where you want to,"We bought this after reading the reviews here...but wish we hadn't. Our TV is above the fireplace. The stud is not in the exact center of the fireplace, so to mount this correctly and with the supplied hardware, we'd have to mount it about 8"" off center. It can be mounted where you want it to be if you mount in in masonry. But -- drywall only without a stud being in the center -- not with this hardware. And, my Tv is small and light; the hardware is heavier than the TV. So--- only if the stud is in exactly in the middle of where you want to hang this thing, or if you're hanging it into masonry... This product can work if you use some other items (i.e plywood on the studs, then you put the mount on the plywood), but then another product would be better; go buy that other product first, or be prepared to run to the hardware store AFTER buying this one."
5,It was so easy to install,"In searching for the best price and best quality and will recommend this product to a friend. I was given a new flat panel and needed to install this product, it didn't have the correct size screws for the new model I had purchased. I called the TV Manufacturer they advised they had switch to a new size screw size for mounting. I called Sanus, spoke to man name Paul with a mid-west accent who sent me the new TV mounting screws overnight. It was easy to install, easy to mount the brackets and easy to mount the TV. I am extremely pleased with this product!"
2,"Doesn't Fit 42""","Says up to 42"" but not big enough for my Insignia LCD. Bummer, knew it was too good to be true."
5,Can't Beat It!!,"This bar is so lucious! Dark chocolate with 3 kinds of nuts is a chocoalte lover's ambrosia!! Not too sweet or too heavy, this bar is simply delicious."
4,THE BEST GAME EVER MADE,You might be thinking right now im just one of those people that get hooked on dumb games but your thinking wrong look at the average 5 STARS. you know why because this game has over 15 different endings and 45 characters in the versus mode which is 6 players with a multi tap and that isnt even the best part about it. the 2 player story mode was the most fun ive had in a game ever. on the second level you get a computer controlled character that actually helps you and your not even mad when he kills all the bad guys hes just THAT COOL!!!!!!!
5,Wonderful,Profoundly moving in a pure spirit of a world no longer existing. Reminds me of starched clothes and hand-carried water pails
5,The real LIVE Drive By Truckers,"""Alabama Asswhuppin'"" is truly representative of the best of the real Drive By Truckers. As Patterson Hood says in the liner notes ""left rough and ragged just like the devil intended"". Recorded in 1999 to 2000 when Rob Malone was still playing with them, it's as close as you can get to seeing them live during those days. For those of you who never got to see them play in a smoke filled club while drinkin' lots of whiskey. Pour yourself one and turn it up!"
1,Don't believe the shipping dates or that you can cancel,"I ordered one of these and was given a shipping window of between 6 and 12 days out. Without notification (as was promised) the shipping dates slipped 3 to 4 weeks. On the 12th day I went to my account and was told that the order was ""being processed for shipping"" and could not be changed, yet the earliest shipping date was over two weeks out. This is not the place to buy other than books/CDs/etc."
3,Toro Blower,The product works very well. One thing to consider is that I found it very difficult to change for blower to vacuum. The vacuum was extremely difficult to remove. My husband finally came up to adding vasoline to make it easier to handle. I now don't attach it as firmly as the directions say.
5,Toro Super 12 Amp Electric Blower/Vac,Great vac and blower. This is a powerful machine. Really does a great job vacuuming the leaves and pulverizing them. Has a lot of power and is easy to use.
2,Worked great until it stopped working altogether,"I bought this blower hoping to save a few bucks. I regret that decision now.As other folks have mentioned, the vacuum capability of this leaf blower leaves much to be desired. I was generally pleased with this blower until it decided to completely stop working. I only got one full season's use out of it; it died in the middle of my second season, leaving me with a useless piece of junk and a large pile of leaves to rake. I'm still within the warranty period, but I never registered my product and can't find my receipt, so I suspect I'm out of luck.I tried calling a local place that services Toro lawn tools, and they told me that it would be cheaper to buy a new one than replace it. The way that they responded indicated to me that this wasn't their first inquiry about this unit.I've learned my lesson; I won't be so cheap when I buy my next leaf blower."
2,Powerful but clumsy.,"This unit performs well, if your up to holding and aiming it. I've only used it as a vacuum unit for garden refuse.I'll have to admit that in younger days it might have been 'a piece of cake', but as a senior citizen with age related infimities, it's almost too much to handle.It appears well built. The only mechanical problem I've had is the supossedly easy vacuum bag dissconect. After a few uses residue build up in the tightly fitted connecting sleeve which retards the 'quick release function'.....sometimes requiring a tool to pry it off.Also, It's availabel from Amazon at two different prices. If you plan to order.....make surre you have the lowest cost site.JFM"
3,Didn't Work Initially,"Bought this blower/vacuum based on other reviews on Amazon. Product arrived, but sadly did not ""blow"" at all (although vacuum worked fine). Called the Toro support number on the box, and was happy to find someone to help on a weekend. Almost immediately the support person said, ""oh, that's probably a problem with this part"" (can't remember what they called it) So, am assuming this is somewhat of a common issue. Replacement part arrived in another week, and blower works fine now.Good size, pretty strong, although am still a little leery of the all plastic construction (I guess is to be expected from a $50 blower) All in all, a good choice for my smallish yard."
4,This baby blows and sucks!,"So far, so good! Only drawback is that you need to make sure you have an extension cord that reaches the far corners of your yard. The mulching claims are a little lofty, but you can still easily mulch 4 or 5 bags to 1. The low speed setting is nice for removing leaves from areas with mulch or decorative rock. The vac has plenty of power for leaves and maybe even the neighbors pesky cat..."
1,Smokes,"I've had two of these. Under normal, residential use, they both lost power and then began to produce an electrical smoke. The first one I brought back to the store I bought it from, and they exchanged it. On the second one I called Toro. They state that, at my expense and with proof of purchase, I should return it to them in MN, and they will ship me another Toro 51591. No thank you! I'll only be doing this a third time in the near future."
1,Burned up after a season,"Worked great the first season. Second season I was blowing some dirt off my driveway and it started to slow down then I started to smell electrical smoke. Of course, a year later I didn't have my receipt any longer so this turned out to be just a big paper weight. Disappointing for a a Toro product."
4,"Purchased, then returned....","Bought the Toro blower/vac and had to return it within 24 hours.The strap to the bag broke almost right away and I found the vacuum unit to be uncomfortable/cumbersome to use for someone who is 5'4"" tall.It had enough power to do the job, but seems to be made for taller users."
5,Best blower at the best price!!!,"5 STARS!!! (I tried to change it from the 3 stars and couldn't)The Toro Super Blower is a super product. I had owned the prior model which was fantastic, lasted for years and years. I questioned some of the changes to this model at first, but after using it for the past couple years, I love it! I once owned a gas blower which did fine for a couple years. Then the hard starting began. Had to have it repaired. Used it another year or so and the engine froze up. Garbage. I'll never own another gas blower after buying this Toro Super Blower. Low speed helps control gathering while high speed is super strong. Plus you have a vacuum to clean leaves out of your shrubs! The knock on electric blowers is having to deal with the extension cord, but I'd rather have that to deal with than the mixing of the fuel and hard starting problems associated with gas blowers. I'll own a Toro Super Blower the rest of my life if they continue building it. Great product!!!!"
2,"It's okay, but can do better","The housing is made of a hard brittle plastic that can crack. The cord holder should have been designed to be a smigen larger to hold a 12 gauge extension cord comfortably. The 2 speed settings are inadequate. It should have at least 3 speeds(low, medium and high). The lowest setting blows too strongly for delicate jobs and the intake on the bottom of the blower constantly sucks up your pant leg if you are wearing shorts. I would suggest looking at Stihl, Red Max or Shindaiwa if you want a quality gas blower."
4,"Toro 51591 is Okay, especially for the price","This product performs fairly well at blowing leaves around the yard. It impresses me as a pretty good deal for the price.The only negative is that the vacuum feature doesn't seem practical. It ""inhales"" leaves at a slow rate and the instructions warn you that twigs can damage or break the impeller. It's hard to imagine how you can avoid vacuuming twigs along with leaves. Also, my experience is that it doesn't take a very large twig to jam the impeller. Since I bought this as a blower I'm not especially concerned about it's inadequacy as a vacuum--I just think you shouldn't take that ""feature"" too seriously."
3,"Not bad, not good",I agree with other reviews that the blower works GREAT. The vacuum on the other hand clogs a lot and is quite slow (like most blower/vacs gas and electric). The impeller on my unit broke on the second day of mulching use. I wanted the 51598 Ultra model with the metal impeller just because of this. I could only find the 51591 at local stores and needed to get started so I jumped in and made the purchase. I just ordered 2 replacement plastic impllers from Partstree.com. I also ordered one of the metal impellers for the 51598 just to see if it would fit on the 51591. If I find that it does in fact work with the 51591 Super Blower Vac I will post my findings. The bottom line is that I wish I had just went ahead and ordered the 51598 to begin with.
2,Impeller broke while vacuuming,"Well, the broken impeller story told in one of the previous reviews just happend to me - about 2 hours ago to be precise. I bought mine last fall and it worked great for blowing leaves. As a vacuum it's clearly underpowered but gets the job done if you take it easy. While the leaves are sucked through the impeller chamber they are broken into smaller chips and this reduces the overall volume a lot. To me it's more useful than the vacumming itself.The impeller on this model is made of plastic. A small piece of it broke off while I was vacuuming the leaves this afternoon. The sudden noise and viberation caused by the inbalance was simply unbearable. I had to give up with the yard half finished.My next unit is going to have a metal impeller. Toro's own 51598 model is only 20 dollars more. Sounds good to me."
1,powerful blower,"The set up was easy. The power is great on this blower. It was easy to use although with the extension and the bag for vaccumming I found myself scrunching my shoulders to keep the end up, I'm 5'2"". So, it was slightly uncomfortable, but it did the job really well. Another issue, I have still not been able to get the vaccuum unassembled to use the blower again. The plastic extension is stuck ""on"". I haven't contacted the mfg yet, but will."
4,Great bang for the buck,"Got a great deal on this and finally picked one up so I can dry my black car off without spots here in southern California. Works very good, gets in all the cracks and crevices. I haven't tried the vaccum part yet but I can say as a blower for this price it has a lot more power than I expected."
1,motor is burning up,The motor is starting to smoke and appears to be dying. It was only used on occasion in light duty.
1,Motor doesn't motor,"The plastic tab on the bottom guard broke off, so it won't engage the safety switch, which means the blower won't work at all, without the replacement part. I'm going to try superglue, which might work for a few minutes.I expected better from Toro. Never tried the vacuum feature."
5,Great blower!,"They are not lying when they say this is a very powerful blower. I have to really be careful or I will blow all my landscaping rocks away and also to not make a bigger mess than what I started with. The switch to vacuum could be easier but it's not bad. It definitely works better as a blower though.I highly recommend the Super 12, forget about the gas products, this works just as good and at half the price."
4,Toro Electric Blower/Vac model 51591,Works well but impeller broke. Where can I find new one? Would be a great blower if impeller was metal.
2,A real powerhouse,"I just put it to work today. I didn't realize an electric unit this size would have so much power. I cleared gravel from the side walks, clean out my garage and swept the front porch. However, the real reason I purchased the unit was to sweep the yard before mowing with my new push reel mower. I have my flower beds mulched with shredded cypress wood that our Kansas winds continually blow into the grass. Some of the chips will stop the reel mower dead in its' tracks. This can be very frustrating when trying to get the yard clipped at the end of the day. I have got to say that the vacuum capabilities of this unit quickly dispelled any apprehension I had prior to its use. I think you definitely need to be cautious about what you try to pick up. But the unit did a very good job of mulching."
4,Effective and fairly quiet leaf blower,"This is my first leaf blower so these comments are aimed at other neophytes, especially folks who hope a blower will solve all their leaf collection problems (it won't) or fear the noise will lead to spats with the neighbors (that probably won't happen, either).The product generally meets my expectations. It emits a powerful air stream. However, it's not as useful as I had hoped for herding leaves and other plant debris in the area around my patio, there's just too much vortexing as the air stream bounces off uneven surfaces and walls. It's great for performing a final dust-off after I have gathered leaves the old-fashioned way - with a rake.The blower is quieter than I expected. This was a pleasant surprise after being disturbed for years by professional gardeners with their gas-powered backpack blowers."
4,"good leaf blower, mediocore vacuum","This will blow leaves very well (and will even blow small rocks and topsoil so be careful, especially around delicate plants) on the low- or high-power setting. The vacuum works well for leaves, even when they are freshly wet (though not decomposed) but only if there aren't small branches in the mix. Twigs plug up the vacuum tube and dirt will pack into the impeller area so solid that it can make leaf removal a longer chore than without this machine for a small yard. Buy it for the blower but plan to shovel the leaves into bags if the leaves are from a dirt surface. Works like a charm with leaves on concrete or grassy areas."
3,Could be better,"I have used mine for 4 seasons now for 1/4 acre with heavy Oak and Hickory leaves. I use the blower for the large areas and the vacuum to suck leaves out of my bushes and from along the edge of my fence. The vacuum is just too slow and heavy (bag full of leaves) for anything else given the size of my yard. The bag zipper is not very substantial and has given me problems. The blower ""spout"" does not want to say on and falls off with anything more than a minor bump. The control for regulating the air flow keeps working closed (less power). I had to put a screw into the plastic to hold it open to get maximum air flow. The impeller on the inside is plastic and a wear item (it doubles as a fan and leaf chopper), yet Toro provides no information other than ""See a Dealer"" for getting a new one--try that at the ""Warehouse Home Center""-type store most people (like me) by these at."
1,Blows Great but Sucks Bad,"The blowing ability of this thing is great. However, we bought the thing to also vacuum. In vacuum mode, the thing is dreadful. If you vacuum leaves that are the slightest bit wet (always a problem where we live) the impeller chops them up but the resulting leaf/dirt/gunk packs into the sides of the blower housing. After a short while the gunk buildup reaches the plastic impeller and proceeds to gring it into oblivion. Finding a replacement impeller has been a nightmare. Just try to find one at your local dealer or on the web. It ain't happening. If you need to vacuum more than occasionally, do yourself a favor and forget the Super Blower Vac."
5,one of the better children in entertainment books out there,"I have purchased quite a few books on the subject of child modeling/acting and this by far is one of the better ones. It has a lot of information on how to get your child started in the entertainment industry whether you live in los angeles or not. Although it is definately geared toward acting, it could also be useful for modeling...same general rules still apply. At the end of the book it even lists some reputable children's talent agencies located in the los angeles area. All in all, a very good resource that i still consult from time to time."
2,Geared more towards kid actors & general auditioning tips; okay book.,"This book is definitely geared towards parents with kids interested in acting. Good info on auditioning and selecting an agent/manager. Okay book, not as easy or personable read as some other books that I have purchased that are written from the parent's point of view on ""how to"" or ""what to expect"". Not too sure I would call this a ""handbook"" per se, but a good book to gain a little more knowledge about the child entertainment business."
1,A very basic primer,I wish I could have searched inside this book before purchasing. In this book you will get the most basic information needed to make the move. The author also sites contributors with questionable backgrounds regarding children.I would easily recommend passing on this book.
5,Great Replacement Bag for good price,"This bag lists for $120, so Amazon has a good price. It was purchased to replace the bag on my 10 year old mower that had just worn out. Very easy installation and works better than the original bag."
3,Lots of fun--but not what I expected.,"Great singing, a lot of humor. However, if you're wanting a cd where the songs are really from the musicals, then keep looking. Many of the songs have been ""tweaked"" and adlibbed, so they're funny, but certainly not original."
5,Nicely done...,"My wife and I have enjoyed listening to this performance on our drives in the car. We enjoyed all of the leading men's contributions, especially Richard Muenz and his intro and performance of Stranger in Paradise."
5,AMAZING!!!!,"Absolutely wonderful! I can't beleive I haven't heard of this till now. These five men are all outstanding, and what makes this particularly winning is that they all obviously had a ball performing this concert/recording. Each of the gentlemen is given a couple chances to shine individually, but what is exceptional is when they sing together. The combination of voices is stunning. There is not one selection that is not outstanding, they are all wonderful. If I had to pick a favorite it might be the finale song, Let Me Be The Music, that all five perform together. The harmonies are glorious. While I had seen Muenz, Holmes and Raines perform before, and liked them, I've been won over by Dvorsky and Nease as well. A MUST HAVE CD for theater lovers."
5,***FIVE STARS***,I saw this film at the Woods Hole Film Festival in 2007 and it's stayed with me since then. A masterful doc about an important subject. The music and cinematography are also fantastic. Highly recommended.
3,"Decent, Typical Bill Holmes Fare","I appreciate what Mr. Holmes is getting at with his series of books, and I have purchased several of them. The material is fair in its description and accuracy, but if you purchase this book with the idea of building a gun at home (provided you have met the government's regulations), you had best think again. The only way to construct a firearm utilizing the methods in Bill's books is to have access to machinery including a lathe and milling machine. That being said, the books are worth a read to familiarize yourself with basic gun construction and the techniques included can be used and expanded upon in your own design."
2,blank pages,"Overall the book is... OK. My copy arrived with the sacle drawings missing. On the pages where the drawings belonged were only arrows and mesurements. Some of the drawings were printed in the negitive, with the page black and the lines white. This would have prevented me from undertaking the project had I not found another resouce with the correct drawings intact. I printed the drawings and stappled them into the book."
1,Angry plus dissapointment,"After buying and reading the book I realized that I need a lathe and milling machine to make the machine-gun. ! Lost my money. I think the author must let the visitors know about the ""little fact"", before buying."
1,"A Book for school Children, not surgeons",I have an extensive library of anatomical and surgical texts of the head and neck and this book is simplistic and poorly done. The illustrations are not helpful unless you are a novice in medicine... I bought it and returned it the same week... i was deeply disappointed in otherwise well respected authors... sometimes people assume a name will sell... thank god for return policies!
1,Is this really fruit punch?,"These sticks did not taste like fruit punch at all- had a weird, not even fruit-like taste. would not recommend."
2,at least it does what the title says,disc defender of course! it keeps my discs from being scratched but I cant play my discs! They are no longer being read properly so I must takek them all off if I can
3,Quite Pricey,"The cheapest place I found Red Bull is at Costco $31.99 for 24 cans. It's kind of yucky tasting- like cough medicine, but it does keep up energy. Don't try to chug it. I did, and I felt like i was going to hurl. Not an instant buzz, but I don't feel fatigue at the end of my workouts."
4,Useful,"This book can be easily confused with the similiarly titled ""Art Price Index"" - so make sure you know which is which. This auction record index is thorough but it doesn't include buy in prices. Auction prices are listed in british pounds and dollars. The sale date and auction house is included for each record but the media of the work is missing for some of the records - mysterious and annoying."
3,"not in good shape soundwise,sorry to say","I have the original album as I was in the original cast recording It's still on the records not CD. Do you know anyone in Los Angeles area that could transfer the recording to CD?? My name was Karen Lund while on Broadway, now Beverly De Menna."
3,Good Book,I like this book .This book learn me many words I don't know them.I really interesting whit this Dictionary. It's the best .
4,history of archaeological thought in the 20th century,"This book is a very well written review of how most americanist archaeologists approached their subject during most of the 20th century, through the culture history model. The book is a throrough explanation of this model, its assumptions, procedures and consequences. Even if the authors tone can sometimes sound a bit arrogant (the confidence provided by hindsight) its better than the average archaeological theory book, written in a clear, jargon-free language. And whenever there is jargon, it is thoroughly explained. More archaeologists should write like this."
3,Not at all what I expected,"I am not at all impreesed with Shrek Super Slam. I though it was going to be an amzing game that was similar to Super Smash Bros. Mele but it didn't even come close.Pros*Story mode has a coupple of funny jokes*Some of the characters are alot of fun to play with*Almost all of the feilds are amazing to play on*The voices of teh characters are greatCons*The graphics, color, and sound, is not at all good*Story mode is way, way to short*Once you have unlocked all the characters the mele portion is not that much fun so you will not want to go back and play the game againOverallThe game is worth a quick rent at best but even then you will find that you will want to return it within about 2 days time."
1,Bad Advertising,"I ordered this product before christmas and i put down Gamecube for the system and i got a PC disc my son can not play the PC disc because he does not have that, I would advise you to ask the seller questions before buying. I am not happy with this product until the seller sends me the disc i bought which is for Gamecube."
4,Another quality UK crime thriller...,I caught this part way in when it was on tv and was really keen to see the whole thing and have been trying to get it for years... was really glad to finally find it and wasn't disappointed to see it in it's entirety. Well acted and well put together.. definitely another quality UK crime thriller.
5,Amnesia,"Bit by bit, the movie reveals the secrets of its characters.At first I was disappointed with the ending but after some reflection, I see what the screenwriter was doing."
1,A Mess,"The film is really a mess. After we watched it, we sat there and said, ""Why? Why? Why?"" and ultimately decided the writer/s just decided to sting a bunch of red herrings amd illogical events together and call it a screenplay. If you do decide to watch...think about all the plot elements afterwards and you'll see what we mean."
3,Good for holidays,"I wouldn't leave it up full time. The flag is good quality, but the hardware is kind of cheap. The instructions (yes, read the instructions for how to install a flag on a pole) say to remove the set screw. This is not refering to the wall mount, but at the top of the pole where the flag attaches. I broke the ring that hold the flag to the top in about 2 seconds while trying to attach the flag to the pole. Once I fixed the damage I created, the install was easy and the flag looks great. I'm not sure how it is going to hold up in the weather, but I will probably only use it on holidays."
3,"""Flag made in U.S.A. Components made in China or Indonesia""","Very nice flag, but come on, why not make the pole and bracket in the States as well? I think at least on the purchase of the American Flag, I should not fund the Chinese military.Other issue I have with the flag is that the advertisement tag is obnoxiously large, and not removeable. A 1"" x 2 1/2"" logo tag in white stands out like a sore thumb against the blue.However it is a nice flag and has a good feel. The sewn stripes and embroidered stars do give it some texture."
3,Good Value,Pro's: vibrant colors; quality stitchingCon's: flag is light weight and wraps around the pole in a moderate breeze; requires pliers to clip flag into harness; white manufacturer's tag on blue field of stars needs to be trimmed off with scissors
5,Beautiful flag,"Flag is bautiful, vivid colors, nicely sewn. Will come back for another when this one wears out!"
3,mounting bracket,"The plastic mountiong bracket broke on a windy day. We had gusts up to 40 MPH. The mounting bracket sheared off sideways. I was surprised since the mounting bracket looked strong enough. This is the first mounting bracket that failed in all the years we have been flying the American flag. The rest of the material,flag pole etc are perfect."
3,Can't handle the wind.,"Nice Flag, Pole, Mount combination for the money. However after just a few weeks of being out in the elements the flag began to fray. Need to bring it in when the wind picks up to keep it in good shape."
2,I wouldn't touch this pole with the 10 foot pole,"The flag is great, but the pole is a joke. The metal joint that connects the two extensions of the pole is loose. As a result, the setup looks flaccid (and certainly not American!)."
5,Great Flag,This flag kit is very nice. The flag is made of quality material and the assembly for the pole was easy.
1,Which set is this?,"Beware when purchasing this set. There have been many Star Trek Original Crew Movie sets produced in the past several years. Some of them contain director's cuts and special editions for some of the movies. The latest set contains director's cuts or special editions for all of the movies - 12 discs in all.(...). The description says the set includes 6 discs, which implies that it does NOT contain the director's cuts and special editions for any of the movies, yet it also states that it was released in 2004. This would imply that it is the latest set and does contain the special editions. Then again it might be the set that was produced a couple of years ago, which contains the 2-disc director's cut for the fist film and 2-disc special editions for films 2, 3 and 4, but the regualar one-disc editions for 5 and 6. Who knows? Since there is no picture posted for this set(...)."
5,Get the 2004 Edition!!!,"I liked the original box series very much. All of the extra special features discs contained enough production and interview sequences on each of the six films. Some of it was filler like ""is time travel possible"" or ""terra forming"" where a lot of experts get very far off the subject of Star Trek. Paramount did an honest job of remastering each film to DVD, they are clear, sharp and crisp. It would have been nice to see more of the deleted scenes from Star Trek V so many could see why Bill Shatner pooped on Paramount for butchering the film into under 2 hours. But you honestly can't complain. It's a great set. Get it while Amazon still has it cheaper than eBay and everywhere else."
2,Hold out for the Extras,"I am a huge Star Trek fan. So far I have bought four of the DVDs: The Next Generation triology and ST:IV. I was very disappointed in the lack of extras. Star Trek: Generations did not even contain a movie trailer. (ST:IV contained some decent extras.) Most serious Trek fans would love commentary from the directors and/or actors. It is well known that there has been footage that was not included in the theatrical releases of almost every Trek film. Most notably, ST:II, where missing footage was shown when it was originally broadcast on TV. This footage made a GREAT movie even BETTER. None of this was included in the DVD. It is rumored that Paramount will be releasing Special Editions of the Trek films, including a 2-disc set for ST:II. Don't pay Paramount twice. The Trek films are all on TV so often, that you can tape a rough copy while you wait for Paramount to give us the extras we want and deserve. (The reason I gave the set 2 stars is because they are decent movies.)"
1,I'm with the other guys...,"Greetings, all. I was gonna warn you to not get this set 'cause Paramount will soon be releasing all of these in Special Edition format. Slowly. One by one. Probably on a monthly-to-bi-monthly basis, so they can all revel in the glee of the DVD-collectin' Trekkie's frustration whilst rakin' in the bucks from the sorry people who bought the regular-edition flicks. Like I did, unfortunately.However, it looks like a couple folks have beaten me to it in the kvetching department. So, just ignore my review, and take a look at what most of my other fellow Amazonians are saying about this sad collection. As you can see, we're pretty much on the same page regarding this situation. Thank you for your attention.'Late!"
4,Very Nice if you want the first 6 movies,"THis is a very nice set if you only want the first 6 movies. However, I think you need the 7th video to end it."
1,"The ""Director's Cut"" changes the movie, all right!","Well folks, I bought the set with the Director's Cut of ""Star Trek: The Motion Picture"" and watched that rascal as soon as I got home. Where the Klingon captain commanded ""Chok Ta!"" (Tactical!) in the opening sequence was gone! Other changes in this Classic almost made me want to get my money back. I must have seen the Classic a dozen times. This was a different movie! I'll probably never watch it again. I will certainly not buy the director's cut of any of the other Trek movies. If it wasn't right the first time, why was it released in the theatres? If they release the original with deleted scenes and such, I might reconsider, but director's cuts, no thanks! IMHO"
5,Original Crew the Best,"Being a fan of the original Star Trek TV series, I found this set very enjoyable."
4,It was good,"I reccomend this book to all those girls who are nervous about middle school. I read books a lot and this was a pretty good book. I liked it. I could really relate because some call me a ""nerd"" cause I read a lot but this teaches you shouldn't change your personality just to impress people."
2,Lizzie Stinks at last!!,"... Over the summer I read lizzie at last for school. I hated it! It is about a girl named Lizzie who is a nerd and is worried about being popular, having a boy friend, and she is only in 7th grade...! She always worries about weird things!Lizzies parents are not social at all. They are just like her!! (Hint: If you have to read this book for school, just read the back of it!)"
4,lizzie at last,"This story is about a girl named Lizzie and she is always been called the lizard. This year she is going to start seventh grade and the night before School starts her aunt takes her out for shoes. Her aunt also buys her new school clothes when she wore them the first day of school. Everyone was so amazed with Lizzie's transformation with her outfits. Instead of her wearing her white old antique Emily Dickinson dresses.I really enjoyed this book; it was a great fiction story and a lot of people would really enjoy it. If you like to read fiction books and books that change kids school life's by changing the way they dress, and their first dances, and other problems with school then you would really enjoy this book. This is a great book and there are a lot of surprises. This book is a page-turner. You would just want to keep reading it and reading until it is finished. I would not mind reading this book again and again!"
3,They don't make 'em like they used to,"While still of the same functionality the thickness of the aluminum is a mere fraction of days of old. I imagine the inserts are thin enough to warp in high heat, so be careful.ALSO--don't put these in your dishwasher. Darned new detergents turn them black!!!"
1,waste of $,"It didn't keep meat hot very long, so I stopped using it. Also, the quality wasn't that great. Waste of $."
4,"If you like English police procedurals, you'll love these.","Read them, read them, read them. Police procedurals are a genre of their own. You either love them or you hate them. I fall on the side of those who love them. Cynthia Harrod-Eagle's are of course police procedurals set in England, so if you don't enjoy that setting, then don't go here. If you feel a closeness with stories set in England, then you'll enjoy these. I was a little disappointed with Slider being a dim bulb when it comes to women, but I guess that goes with the territory. His crew finds him very insightful and a great interviewer who sees many things that others miss, but he can't see what goes on under his own nose. I am waiting for him to tumble to the fact that Atherton loves JoAnna and I wonder what this will do the relationship amongst the three. I eagerly await the next in this series.Again - read it, read it, read it"
3,"""The Song Of Demons Plays On The Wind""","The interplay of opposites is a constant in life; day and night, darkness and light, male and female, good and bad. The same holds true for Tristania's 'Ashes' [Enhanced] [Special Edition].To concentrate on the good I have two words, Vibeke Stene. When she is singing the lyrics and music take the listener on a hypnotizing and sometimes frightening trek into a Netherworld where ""the Song of Demons"" is clearly discerned. When she is not singing the music slips backward into a somewhat mediocre collection of tunes. Don't get me wrong, they're not bad songs, they just don't carry the same emotional impact when Vibeke isn't singing.Receipt for Success: Keep Vibeke at the microphone as much as possible."
2,A bitter disappointment,"I listened to this album 3 times so far. Gone are the choirs, gone are the violins and with that gone is the sound that made Tristania one of the pioneers of symphonic goth metal. This new direction undertaken by the band may ultimately spell its doom. Even the angelic voice of Vibeke Stene is pushed to the background instead of being the driving force behind the music just like in the previous Tristania albums. If you are new to Tristania, I wouldn't suggest buyng this album first. Buy Widow's weeds or Beyond The veil. These albums are true examples of excellent musicianship and extraordinary lyrical talent. They really showcase the Tristania sound in all of its power and glory."
1,Utterly Underwhelming,"You'll see it wherever the stars are low. Ashes is a miserable attempt at a Tristania album. Bands change, yes. But this is an abomination of all sorts. Gone is everything that once was Tristania. The choirs, the programming, the style...gone. Even Vibeke's vocal performance has been reduced to ""ashes.""Great title for the record Tristania. Seriously.Buyer beware."
1,Ashes,"What a horrible album from Tristania. Four years to write seven songs (eight if you get the bonus track), and not a single one of them is any good. This does not sound at all like Tristania. I knew they were in trouble when Morten left them on their own, but I had been expecting something more in the vein of World of Glass, not something that sounds like it could be on one of those crappy Hot Topic compilation CDs. Normally, I would give the band an extra star just for being Tristania, but they don't even deserve to call themselves that anymore. If you still want to listen to the album, download it, borrow it, etc, before you buy."
4,final confession,Thought this book was very interesting to read. As you got further into the book. the better it was. Knowing the writer personaly I was not expecting it to be that good. But it exceeded my expectations.I would suggest this book to others. I have not read a book for at least 8 years. Finshed this one in 2 days. So that sould say some thing about this book.
5,Home use,I bought this to use at home and do basic pilates exercises. The video was very useful since I am new at this discipline. The barrel is well made and easy to use. I found it very comfortable and not at all slippery.
5,great buy,"I teach pilates for a living and require that all my students have one of these at home! great buy, good product, good video and free shipping!!!"
4,GREAT MIX,An original and well composed tracklisting for both the breaks and dnb cds. Gotta say the breaks cd is the one that does it for me even though i'm a big dnb fan. BOH !
5,Awesome!,"This had all the bells & whistles that I wanted, and then some. I can put about 200 HIGH quality songs on a single disc. Has a great anti skip, it's light, easy to use & it looks good. Plus it has a radio (a must for me). It's also gets TV stations, which is great while working. The only thing it's missing is a lighted display, but the display it offers is pretty wonderful. Who would want an ipod, when this offers so much more, & for less money?"
2,Oh! Great... is not the same 3V and 4.5V,"I got a Psyc CD Walkman with AM/FM Tuner, everything is ok with it.The only thing is that I wanted to use my old AC/DC adaptors (at home/car) and, it turned that the psync cd player has a 3V input, instead of a 4.5V as it's shown at sonystyle.com page. It took me time to be sure about getting that product and I trusted in sony's information, and now I have to live with that, (I'm just kidding).[...]Besides that inconvenient, the Cd Player comes with a lot of options, the loading stuff showed in the screen is great, it also shows you the percent loaded of the disc, programmable shutdown, and the radio works great, also the way how directories are showed now, it only uses a AA battery.To be perfect it needs a backlight to use it in the darkness and, of course I need a 3V adaptor now. And sony also needs to check some articles descriptions.Now I feel better..."
2,Of minor interest,"Once-popular Rex Beach remains quite readable, even after all these decades, but there's little reason to take an interest in him now. There's not much literary merit in his writing and the appealing nature of his lively and colorfully-set plots can easily be found in a host of modern works. However, fans of the 1952 movie, with Gregory Peck and Ann Blyth, may find some enjoyment in comparing the two versions, and may be surprised to discover that the movie only covers the first half of the story."
4,Semi-good,"Of itself, this is a very good series. The writing, acting, production values--all first rate. But it is a switcheroo of the series ""House."" Whereas Dr. House is a medical detective who determines and cures ailments no one else apparently can, the doctor in this series is a medical examiner who determines cause of death and whodunit when others disagree. One doctor is male, the other is female. Both have physical ailments and oversized egos. Both battle their superiors and prevail only because of their talents. One is in New Jersey, the other in Philadelphia.Once a TV or movie producer happens upon a successful production, others immediately jump on it, turn a few details around, and act as if the revised show were brand new. It happened with westerns, reality shows, sci fi--the list goes on. And sometimes the new version is as good--as it is here. But it is still a copy."
2,Hokey and unoriginal,"For a TV show with a well-known and quite admirable cast, the characters and storylines are quite awful. Whoever wrote Delaney's character wanted to remake Gregory House but didn't have the nerve or the know-how to write her character with the depth of House's likeable misanthropic qualities. The relationships between the characters are hokey and totally unbelievable- what police detective wouldn't want help from the medical examiner??? Apparently the male detective on this show . . . not worth your time or money to watch- you won't be hooked. I'm giving it 2 stars instead of 1 only because I do actually like the actors, just not their characters."
2,"All things told, not a very good show.","Like ABC's ""CASTLE"" but without the interesting characters, original situations and smartly clever dialogue. All things taken in together ""Body of Proof"" is pretty hollow and leaves you hungry. Way too much medical terminology and lingo is tossed about in an effort to seem much smarter and creative than it is and the whole thing just comes off as lacking and trying too hard to compensate for what are ultimately thin premises and lightly developed characters. I wanted to like the show because I love shows of this type - but every time I watch, I walk away feeling the missed opportunity. And since when does ten or so episodes constitute a season? I know it's the ""in"" thing, but I think that is another unfortunate trend."
5,body of proof,like these types of TV's showsactually found 1 that played without skippingI recommend these to everyone 1 knowbody of proof
3,body of proof.,"Story is ok, acting ok.....pleasant way to pass an afternoon. I probably will not watch beyond season 2 as I understand Season 3 has many cast changes"
3,Body of Proof,This is a good story. I loke the interactions between all the characters. There is so much fun and reality among them.
5,combine CSI and Bone!,"This is a GREAT show! It combines CSI n Bones and some good humor, but we need to get Megan a love interest."
2,Proof that this can wait for re runs,I really wanted to see this TV drama and crime show when it was on TV. I bought the item thinking it would end up being on for several seasons and it might. It just isn't as good as Bones or Criminal Minds even Dr G Med Examiner is better. I would wait until re runs of this show come on TV. Don't waste your money.
5,Good TV drama,"I really enjoyed this series and will pick up more in the future. It is a very gripping drama and people who like this kind of show, will like this series."
3,Good series,"The series was very good.... only the very last disc.... the very last episode cut out at the very end. I probably only missed about a minute of the show, but still bummed out"
3,"spike heels help women not b grotesque, says abc","the networks are getting it ... women's rear ends look simply grotesque when women's feet are not in spike heels. so no matter how stupid, spike heels must be worn. the network execs (and all overpaid execs) deserve pretty objects in their lives."
4,I would actually give it 3.5 stars,"Overall I like the show. The story lines are well written and keep you guessing. The pathology is is done very well.I like the cast of characters. Dana Delany is always a sure bet. I guess my main gripe would be with everything elseconsidered who needs a police force when you have Dr. Megan Hunt ? She is the pathologist, investigator, interrogatorand police force all rolled in to one character ! That alone takes some credibility away fromwhat would other wise be easily a 4 or 5 star program."
4,Medical/Crime Show with substance,The pilot is a weak but I like Dana Delany and Jeri Ryan so I have watched the first 4 episodes and it gets better with each successive show. Dana Delany's character starts to develop and she gains insights into her own personal struggles. I think I am going to like this series. I hope it continues for awhile.
3,Check for compatibility first,"My laptop is only a few years old, so I completely expected it to be USB 2.0 compliant. However, when I plugged in this hub, it came up with a warning saying that a 2.0 device was being used in a 1.0 port, and none of the devices that I plugged into the hub worked (they work fine without the hub). I suspect that this is not completely backward compatible with a 1.0 port. I would prefer not to assign a rating since it's probably my fault that I bought the wrong thing, but if I have to assign a value, an average 3 stars will have to suffice."
1,dont be duped by the cover photo!!,what a jip. the cover shot has these cool looking lamps and all but once you open the rest of the book it turns out to be a blurry mess. does this publishing company have a computer? Hello is anybody in there? some of the worst lamps i have ever seen are represented in this book.mrs lindenberger should at least do some research on the prices these lamps regularly sell for. perhaps by checking on eBAY. come to think of it between Ms. Lindenberger and schiffer publishing they have put out more trash price guides than singer made sewing machines.Dont Judge a book by it's cover is definately appropriate in this case.
3,"far-out, funky lamps!","although some of the pictures are not the best, I personaly enjoyed looking at all the quirky lamps. (there are some really outa-this-world looking lamps in this book.) If you want to see some really over the top lamps, check out this book."
3,Out of date but good for first lamp book!,"This was released in 1997, before Ebay and the lamp craze of the 50's and 60's hit its resurgance. It was the very first lamp book I purchased, and the only one with 'funky' lamps that I could find at the time. I found it to be very enjoyable, and a great reference to help me start my vintage lamp - collecting hobby. Though the pictures are a little blurry, and the prices very low, keep in mind that the market is constantly going up, and some are VERY collectible now, bringing in top dollars. If you can find a nice used copy of this book, buy it!"
1,Junk,"Bulky, loud piece of junk. The battery does not last long. The design is not ergonomic whatsoever and is very difficult to figure out. There is not quiet way of listening as the buttons to change music are incredibly loud.Save your money. This is JUNK."
4,Solutions,I wanted to know whether there is any officially published solution book for the above book? As its certainly not possible to solve each n every problem which one(actually each n everyone) would find time consuming. So let me know about it. That's the only reason i rated the book 4 stars.Its worth 5 stars otherwise.
3,"Fun facts, but where are the citations?","I love trivia books like this, and I enjoyed reading about all the little-known sexual facts out there. Especially intriguing is the section on what is still considered a crime in the United States. Who'd have guessed, for example, that in San Francisco, of all places, it's illegal to give and receive oral sex? That said, though, what the book painfully lacked was citations. Where did the author get all these facts? A list of sources at the end would have sufficed for this type of book. I have no doubt that at least most of this is true, but without references, the author, unfortunately, lacks credibility."
4,thing about sex you never knew,"good book if there are things about people and sex that good together to make you think , do people really do or did that and some laws that have to do with sex,, good entaining book"
1,More transformation of culture than nightlife,"There is an unfortunate dearth of books on the nightlife of NYC from the teens through the twenties. This book gives a decent general overview, but I wanted more specific names and dates of cabarets, tea dansants venues, revues and the eventual speakeasies. I am looking for owners, hours of operation, names of entertainers and when they performed, menues and descriptions of the actual rooms and buildings in which it all took place. Though interesting, I was not seeking a treatise on women's rights, and the ""transformation of culture"". Though well-written and at times thought-provoking, this book is two-thirds social history and only one-third about the actual venues and entertainers. The other review did not mention this, so I hope this will be helpful to someone like myself who is seeking the who, what's and when's more than the why's."
1,"worst souding, best looking headphones ever!","I purchased these cans hoping the ney sayers were extreme audiophiles, and the praisers were average people. Turns out the ney sayers were average people like me. These Headphones have ZERO BASS, none. I love bass, I have had 15 + pairs of headphones, some of them $15-$20 dollars that have better bass. I thought maybe these might just have a nice clean sound un-poluted by heavy bass, I would rather have a pair of tweeters on my ears. They look so good though, I actually took a decent pair of headphones and put the speakers from those in the Skull Candies. Let me tell you, it's the design of the cup, they made the good speakers sound like dooky. So if you want somthing that looks great around your neck, like jewlery, get these. If you want good headphones, get a pair of sennheisers(SP?). They have affordable stuff that sounds great."
1,Disappointed,I was very excited to find this product at the price. The look and quality of the headphones is good. However the quality of the sound is poor. I regret my purchase now. I barely use these.
4,pretty good headphones,"Skullcandy SC-BTi Ti Headphones (Black)they are great when they workthey dont work well with the iphone or the ipod touch because of how the headphone jack is made. also, when i got them, the cord was already splitting open so it isn't very durable. make sure you warm them up before playing them at full volume or you may blow them out. have fun!"
2,Extremely disappointed,This is all looks and no sound quality at all. Bass is terrible. I wouldn't waste my money on this again. I listen to hard rock mostly and the bass just sounds muddy and distorted. I have connected it to my Ipod and stereo and the results are similar. Don't waste your money on this. I did like the bag that came with it though. I guess you get what you pay for.
2,Not worth the money,"The sound is clear, but carries no base. I have a pair of Sony MDR-CD180 I paid $20.00 for that I was going to replace; I needed more volume and not loose sound quality for my MP3 player. These headphones are not it! Even at low volume all you get are the highs, there is no depth to the sound at all. I guess it all depends on what you want them for. If you listen to Heavy Metal, save you money, on this series anyway. The more expensive series may be better but I'm not going spend more money on something that may or may not give me sound quality I want. They look good sitting on the shelf though!"
4,Its worth the 5 bucks,I found this game by accident at a funcoland when they were clearing out all their Saturn inventory. You might think its a baseball game by the title...but its a Mahjong game. Even if you have no idea what Mahjong is...this game is still for everyone. Its well worth the 5 bucks you'll pay for it. You'll get alot out of single player....but the game really shines if you have someone to play against. Talk about nail-biting tension. Do yourself a favor and spend the pocket change you have in you car on this game.
2,Bobby Goldsboro Meets Tom Jones Meets ???,"I'm listening to this? I never heard of this guy until recently, when he was recommended as a great and original song writer and performer. Well, some of his songs are interesting, but I still don't hear what all the fuss is about. Walker's songs often sound like a cross between a deranged Bobby Goldsboro and Tom Jones. Guess you have to be in the mood to get him, but I don't yet.What did I like? Well, The Plague is a pretty good song, has a good tempo too. The Seventh Seal presages the obsessions of David Koresh. There are several others that are interesting, but Jeez, this guy is weird. Will I listen to more of his melodramatic rants? Maybe so, the music is so strange it begs to be heard again."
5,"Excellent briefing, fast introduction","As neurology resident, I had to at head MRI, and CT. Yes there are great detailed review books and textbooks, but the chapter in this amazing book about both CT, MRI of head was ""savior"" for me. In my first few weeks, I needed something fast to read and most importantly to make this ""dry"" topic enjoyable which I easily found in those 20 pages.. I believe that not just Students should read it, but every resident doing neurology or rotating in Neurology, it is only 20 pages, easy to digest, and hard to be forgotten. I will add that I scanned the other chapters, Chest, Abdomen I found them very enjoyable too. Another success of this series"
3,"If you're a fan, you'll enjoy the music","I purchased this CD for a friend who had given up looking for it in local stores. The audio quality is fine for the most part, but the vocal on some songs sound as though he is singing through a tin cup. Despite this observation, if you're a fan, you'll enjoy the music."
4,Still photographer (film ) reviews Canon Digital,"I have used Nikon Cameras for over thirty years (Nikon F, FTN, F2 and F3), I also have used medium format and large format cameras. The Canon is my first digital camera experience. I found it extremely easy to use and with a minimum of reading of manual able to replicate the results from my film based cameras. The camera is well designed and the controls fall where you would expect them. Access to the disk compartnment is the one thing I would change (along with accepting other lenses). This is a serious camera for someone interested in digital photography. The features allow creativity without burdening you with compelxity. The range of optical zoom (10X) is great. Image stabilization is perfect for shooting from moving aircraft (high performance jets). It offers the immediate answer that haunts many photographers, i.e. - did I get the shot. One of the best photographic purchases I have ever made."
1,Ridiculous,"The author of this book is right when he says that black people have low self-esteem. What I don't like about this book is that while the author criticizes blacks for trying to look white, he advocates blacks adopting white culture. In fact, capitalism was invented by whites, and was the political/economiacal system responsible for slavery, racism, and colonialism. If you are proud of being black, you should instead live an African lifestyle, respecting the earth, the environment, and other tribes. Africans enjoyed of much more cultural diversity and natural resouces because they knew how to respect the land. Following the steps of the whites will only prove that you are a good copy-cat, and that you have no pride for the rich culture of your ancestors. The very word sucess in this book is completely seen from a white perspective, in which a person's worth is measured by money and education."
1,I'm confused,"I went to the House of Lords Church in Brooklyn to hear Mr. Onyeani speak and I must tell you, in person he makes a pinch of sense. The vast majority of nonsense in this book was never mentioned at the event. It's very hard to think that this guy has a mind while reading this piece of garbage. Isn't capital necessary to be a capitalist? Don't you need victims to capitalize on? Why not write a book about alternative economic systems for Blacks similar to what DuBois, Cruse and Amos Wilson have lamented about for years. The tone wouldn't be a problem if he was speaking logically but he isn't. This has to be some kind of publicity stunt. Just look at the cover."
4,Gets you thinking about things..............,"The book is a compilation of several writers' work. It starts out with some general stories and then gets pretty specific (i.e. with the ""dumpster diving"" and ""funeral costs...."") So I felt the second half of the book wasn't as helpful as the first half. The first half did hit on a lot of great points on people's wasteful tendencies where you say to yourself, ""that is so true!"""
2,"Too much talk, little adivice on how to be frugal","While this book does offer lots of tips on simple liveing and a few quotes in the book that I liked, this book didn't hold my interest very long. Another section in the book that I liked was in the end of the book, there is a helpful resource section to get more infomation about frugal living. I didn't like this book because I don't care to read about the author's and a few other people who discussed their personal experiences on frugal living which there was a lot of. There is a chapter devoted to ""Dumpster Diving"" which I feel is taking frugal living to the extreme ."
1,Horrible quality,"What a waste of money. My own printer at home would have been better quality. I would have never bought this if i knew how crap the print was. Then i call their customer service, they say they can return it, but i had to take a digital picture of the 'poster' and send it to them. Well my camera has been broken and i don't have access to one, so I just swallowed my loss since the thing didn't cost too much. But it's still messed up. Don't bother with this seller if you don't want to go through what i did."
5,One of my favorite shows,"This is a great DVD. It has every hilarious episode of TGttM with equally hilarious commentary for every episode plus lots of behind the scenes and other bonus materials.. However this show is not for everyone, if you enjoy other adult swim shows or other types of ridiculous, absurd comedy then you will love it, but if your idea of a good comedy TV show is something like Friends or According to Jim then it's probably not for you."
1,What a ripoff,This is horrible. It's not even anything like Shrek. I don't know where Tom went before but I know where he'll be going as soon as I calm down long enough to stop shaking with internet fury: THE GARBAGE!
5,"An acquired taste, but all the sweeter once acquired.","I believe that Tim Heidecker and Eric Wareheim are nothing less than the future of humor. If you look at the people doing really funny things today, most of them (David Cross, Michael Cera, John C. Reilly, Fred Willard, Zach Galifianakis) have gotten involved with T&E. You will be shocked and amazed by all the cameos, but there is a reason they want to do the show; it's a chance to experiment with weird ideas and see what humor you can produce from them. Each episode of TGTTM is a journey, sometimes too weird to really be funny, leaving you just scratching your head. But when they pay off, it makes you feel lucky to have watched it, as it really is blazing new territories in humor. It's weird, irreverent humor that has always existed between friends and in the periphery, but only now becoming more mainstream. Make sure to check out Tim and Eric Awesome Show at adultswim.com as well."
5,Rat's off to ya!,"If you're looking into buying this box set, you should have some idea what the show is about. Another Adult Swim 15min show with some very unconventional humor, and one of the best on the network in my opinion. If you like what you see, buy it now. You'll either love it or you'll hate it. Check out the episodes streaming on adultswim.com if you're not sure.As far as the actual box set, it's worth every penny. Commentaries on all episodes w/ some special guest commentaries, deleted scenes, and some other short featurettes. Get it. Run don't walk."
5,Are You Serious?,"I've read a few customer reviews and I am absolutely astounded! I don't think people are getting the joke here. ""Tom Goes To The Mayor"" is one long societal satire. One reviewer said, ""the animation is not as good as Shrek"". Really?? The point of this show was not to excel in animation artistry. It was to make a very funny and critical jab on our social condition. Another reviewer said, ""the animation was not as good as I expected,..."" Sweet lord!!! This is why things like Columbine happen in our world! Another genius said, ""its mean spirited and doesn't have a good message,..."" OMG!!! People are completely out of touch with social commentary. Get a clue people! This was not meant to be some state of the art CGI Disney Pixar work of art. Nor was it meant to be some touchy feely cartoon with a hidden lesson for 5 year olds. Its exactly what its supposed to be, a low tech, sharply funny, spit in your face, reflection of US!!!"
2,NOT FOR EXTERNAL HARDDRIVE ON WIN2K,"I have an older PC and I wanted USB 2.0 for quicker access to 1 TB EXTERNAL HARDDRIVE. The card works with other peripheral (such as Webcam, etc), but locks up and/or causes read errors with HD, which frankly stinks, since that was my primary reason for the purchase. FYI: I also had to do a Windows Update to hotfix WIN2K OS for USB 2.0. If you are not a bit technically savvy, stay away folks."
1,Pure junk,"By all means, STAY AWAY from this item. I got one and there was no way I could get it to work. Windows XP says it was there but did not work. It came with a generic driver CD that has drives on of PCI LAN, Printer and numerous other drivers. I could not even find a driver for USB. I had nothing to loose as I have a play hard drive so I loaded one driver at a time just to see what would happen. No way could I get it to work. Even though the cost is under $5.00, if it does not work.....WHAT GOOD IS IT?I bought a Trend. Plugged in and no drivers were needed for XP. Came with a CD and it had one driver on it for Win 98. Loaded driver for 98 and it worked. By the way, I have a dual boot computer, Win 98se and XP."
4,works great after patch upgrade,I almost gave up trying to get this to work then I found a patch from microsoft that I needed to install. After that it worked fine.
2,USB-PCI Adapters,"4+1PORT USB 2.0 Pci Desktop Card -via Chip SetI expected a card as advertised, with pin connections on the card, but received the three cards without the pin connections. I needed that for the front panel connections on my computers."
2,Even the price does not worth it!,"When I first check this item, I check other website and the people said this will work fine... but they were telling a big lie, because this item it's hard to play... even make all my system to work unproperly... I've updated the bios all day... change the USB configuration... switching all pci slot to work... and neither this port works as should be... please God Help me with this!!!I was copying some dvds of a trip that I take... and hillariously the program says it wil ltake about 6 hours to burning the movie, and that;s supposed to be USB 2.0 faster than anything about USB port... it will be taking 2 hour more to burning if i were using the USB 1.1. ports... I thinking about returning the item..."
3,"Cheap, works","This card is cheap but it does work. Wanted to add a few USB drives to my home server, works w/ Windows Server 2008 w/o software."
3,4 port - 2.0 USB - PCI Card,Product was a great price - shipped and recieved in good time - works just fine.
1,Worked on Most Devices but not Ext Hard Drive,You can't complain too much about the price but it did not work with one of my external hard drives. All the other devices worked ok.
3,wrong product good service,i ordered this card with a hope that my windows 7 desktop will sync my ipod with the itunes. the first card came with in 3 days. after installation my computer won't even recognize any device connected to the card. i contacted the seller and after some investigation the seller agreed that the product is faulty and the seller immediately sent me a replacement card.this card recognized all the devices that i connect to it.some reviewers warned about buying this because it is really USB1.0 and the speed won't help you with any storage device and guess what my ipods are storage devices and this card didn't really solve the problem that i had to begin.so i'll good rating for the seller. i bought this item knowing the risk and i'm ok with that
4,delivered/works,purchased this when native ports on my Dimension 9100 began to fail. Thought i would try the $5 fix before buying a new desktop. the USB card was delivered as promised and works as advertised.
5,Best book on law school and the early years of practice,"This book is what ""One L"" should have been, an honest look at what law school and early practice are all about. The brutal honesty in each story reveals what few lawyers would admit, that behind the professional veneer there is a much grittier reality. Stories about difficult or insane clients, unreasonable bosses, ego clashes and the constant stress get at a side of lawyering that is rarely dealt with openly. Yet the book is not depressing, just honest. An eye opener for anyone interested in the legal profession."
2,I never made it past disc one.,"It's a shame the John McGlinn recording on EMI is out of print, because this travesty is no compensation at all. The singers are really, really bad. And the conductor fails to capture the swing of the score, leaving it sounding dull and lifeless. Run, don't walk, away from this CD."
4,The Art of Reviewing Art,"I love this magazine!!! As if it isn't hard enough to find anyone out there with a good appreciation of independent film (and by appreciation, I also mean knowledge), but then you have to deal with all these film nerds who think that if it wasn't done on a shoestring budget by a no-name director, it must be bad.FILMMAKER does an excellent job of giving an overview of the world of independent film, while still providing good discussions of some more mainstream films. It's tough, when reviewing and writing criticism of any art form, to know what to discuss, and I think that FILMMAKER does this."
3,A nice book...I just discovered I don't care much for Adams!,"The book is interesting and quite well written, if you don't mind the non-chronology of it. I just came away thinking even less of Mr. Adams than I did going in and that was a let-down for me. I think some of his photographs are very pretty, but I would never call them art! They don't ""move"" me and neither did this book."
1,Too dated and not fun,"This game is not scary or fun to play at all. your character walks painfully slowly, she does EVERYTHING painfully slowly. You don't even really make her walk, you just press forward and she takes little penguin steps across the room. And there's no skipping the little animation every time you move, so if you accidentally press right one too many times you have to watch her slowly look across the room. I'm sure this game was terrifying and beautiful in the nineties but there's really no reason to play it now."
1,"Wrong item, right title, wrong size","I had a hard time finding the right replacement spool for an 8"" Toro trimmer that I had purchased last year from Amazon. I entered a search for a spool and was directed to two different ones, which in reality didn't fit this trimmer at all - they were for a 10"" trimmer. But that particular information wasn't given online. You found out after ordering and you had the product in your hand. From that $16 mistake, I then tried again and was offered an 8"" spool through another subcontractor of Amazon. Once again the wrong size - too small. Yes, it fit an 8"", but it also worked on a 7"" and 10"" trimmer. The model numbers were listed on the front of the bag but were not completely in focus on the web site. Again another $10 plus mistake. Oh! How frustrating! I finally found the correct part number, size, etc through the Toro site. Thank goodness!!"
2,replacement spool,The replacement spool listed with trimmer 51467 was 88175 replacement spool and it does not fit the 51467. Can I exchange it?
1,0 star if it was possible,This product was never received & then sent back from wherever in limbo it was stored. I would never buy from them again.
5,Surprisingly Hard to Find Replacement Part,"After a tough weed-whacking season, was running low on trimmer cord and tried to find a compatible replacement, but was unable to. Amazon led me to a supplier who did carry the part and was able to buy several and have them shipped to my remote location without a problem. Now have enough cord spools for the device's expected service life. The new spools are completely compatible and were shipped quickly. Price was okay. Most important factors with a hard to find component: availability and compatibility. Scored big time on both counts."
1,A too-balanced review,"Compared to other books like David Bognar's ""Cancer: Increasing Your Odds for Survival"" and Michael Lerner's classic and profound ""Choices in Healing,"" this book is weak indeed. It is nothing more than a laundry list of a variety of alternative therapies, all presented with a dry and straight-faced summarization. Had I not read other and better books on the same subject, I would have walked away from this volume certainly no wiser and probably more confused about non-traditional cancer treatments. A real disappointment to me as a recovering cancer patient trying to avoid recurrence. If you are looking for the definitive work on the subject, put your money elsewhere."
2,"Interesting, but outdated",Cancer therapy is a rapidly moving target. New alternatives are introduced each day. This book written in 1994 has very little of the newer alternatives. I found it to be of little use in finding some new alternative.
3,"average recording, Eiddwen Harrhy is a fine Hanna","This recording of THE MERRY WIDOW features the cast of the New Sadler's Wells company, with Eiddwen Harrhy in the title role of widow Hanna Glawari, and Alan Oke as Count Danilo. This is another English-language version of the score, though not the best I have heard. I still consider the Joan Sutherland-John Brecknock version as the recording of choice, with the Dorothy Kirsten-Robert Rounseville coming a close second. Eiddwen Harrhy is a fine Hanna (her ""Vilja"" is quite stirring), but the diction of many of the performers is muddy and off-putting.The orchestra under the direction of Barry Wordsworth is sensational. This recording makes me wonder why the Lincoln Center revival with Patrice Munsel has never been issued on CD."
3,"A Latin-English Dictionary of St. Thomas Aquinas, good! but the Lexicon of St. Thomas Aquinas is better.","This is pretty comprehensive, such as it is, but it's second best for those who want the definitive guide to Aquinas's Latin terminology. If you can find a cheap copy then go for it, you won't be sorry. But much better is the longer version: A Lexicon of St. Thomas Aquinas (from which this book is abridged) which is back in print by Loreto Publications for $89.Here's the entry for A Latin-English Dictionary of St. Thomas Aquinas, from Philosophy: A Guide to the Reference Literature, by Hans Edward Bynagle:""This is an abridgment of the Lexicon of St. Thomas Aquinas. ""It contains all the words and meaning given in the Lexicon and most of the research value, but the omission of examples more easily allows a chance of wrong meanings from among the many definitions given"" (McLean, Philosophy in the 20th Century: Catholic and Christian, vol.1, p.5)"""
2,Not fantastic,"Sub is a bit boomy and satellites lack treble. I replaced a separates system with this. Should have kept the separates, or gone with Bose."
4,Mac Dre bears his soul for fans,"If you're a fan of the late Mac Dre, this DVD is a must see. In this exclusive interview, M.D. goes the Tupac route and allows fans to see another side of himself by opening up about many different topics that concern his life and career. The DVD is divided into two parts, the interview which is a little more than 40 mins, and then a day in the life of Mac Dre, where they follow him around and let the cameras roll. The audio transfer for the interview is somewhat distorted for the most part which is why I give it 4 stars. There is also no bonus features. It would be nice to hear commentary from the filmmakers about their experience with the Bay Area Legend and being fortunate enough to conduct the interview at the peak of his career before he was murdered that same year. R.I.P."
3,Comics,"My 7-year-old loves these comics. The only problem I have with them is that the bindings do not hold up well. Often on the first or second reading, the book is falling apart."
5,Great Deal !,Purchased 2 pkg of these from Mr Medical. Arrived in only 3 days. In good condition and all lights worked. Bought for my daughter who is in EMT training on way to Advanced Paramedic Degree. She loves them. Took to class to show other students so they may purchase them also.
1,Not a 6 pack as advertised,Only one light shows up. Where are the rest? This is not a six pack as advertised. I'm not happy about this order at all.
4,Great,"Ordered these pen lights for nursing school. Really wanted ones with the pupil guage. The lights work great and hopefully with having 6 I wont need to buy anymore for a while. Theyre pretty compact which is great because we carry around a lot of stuff in our pockets. Shipping was quick and easy, would buy again!"
1,got on penlight wen the title says 6 pack,what kind of service is this if ur goint to title your item as a six pack im assumin im getting a six pack of penlights not one!! i do not recomend this to anyone there are million other places to get it
2,Disappointed,"So this product seems to be very misleading or they are making a big mistake in shipping. I ordered what is said to be a 6pk, but only received one. Had I known I was only gonna get one I would have ordered from someone else and picked up a couple extra."
4,Diagnostic penlight 6pk,"This product arrived in teh mail after only 3 days of ordering it! i was suprised it arrived so soon in my mailbox. I have had these for a few months and i am still using the very first one. The light is not too bright so it doesnt completely blind my patients when i use it and the battery life is great. I dont really get people who need fancy penlights, what is you lose it? This pen light is disposable so if i lose ot or break it, IT'S OKAY! i have 5 more!"
4,Don't leave home without them,"They work, obviously it's purpose is to check for responsiveness, or other ailments. Probably not going to use this to go camping (though I keep one molle'd into my go bag) but it's always a handy little tool."
3,Pens +/- lights,"These are inexpensive items, and you will get what you paid for. One did not work right out of the package, and the others were glitchy. I am still happy, because they were a cheap way to get me through school requirements."
4,great budget penlight,"pros:it does what its supposed to do, and for the price you cant beat it.pupil sizer is a nifty thingcons:a little on the thick sideneutral:life of one of these is actually unknown now. ill edit and post later when i find out"
3,Should be a 5 pk,One of my 6 lights didn't work upon arival. Don't think its worth sending back for the one. I'll update if I have any problems with use.
1,Primacare pen light,"Oh boy. I ordered the ""DIAGNOSTIC PENLIGHT WITH PUPIL GAUGE - 6pk""; I received ONE penlight.Product features say ---------------------------------------Disposable Diagnostic PenlightsLong-life, disposable penlights mean added convenience -- no need to keep a supply of batteries on hand.6 PENS PER PACK--------------------------------------I was shipped one pen light, which is too bright to use in a lab setting for patient assessment. It does have a LED light, which will translate to longer battery life.My packing list indicates my order was shipped complete, hopefully Amazon will make this right."
1,Not a good product,I bought these and only 3 of them worked and not for a very long time. The battery seems to be half drained when you get them.
4,Pack of six or just one?,"Some reviewers are saying they got only one penlight instead of a pack of six (and I believe them). When I ordered it, I got a pack of six."
3,good basic penlight with pupil gage for the price,"good basic penlight with pupil gage for the price, so cheap easy to dispose of if needed. no complaints so far."
4,So light and easy to use.,"From the heavy seats we had before these are great, easy to get in and out. They do not however really attach to the seat, the seatbelt holds the whole seat but I believe that's how boosters work anyway over 30lbs."
4,"Decent booster, but requires more assembly than the Graco equivalent","This booster is very similar to the Graco highback booster (Girls Rock), but it requires a little bit more assembly, which is probably why it's $5 cheaper. The Graco we purchased was almost completely assembled (attach seat to back -- done), while this one required putting the headrest, covers, and arm rests on. One nice thing this has that the Graco doesn't -- the arm rests lift for easy access."
4,Pretty Booster Car Seat,"My five year old finally got tall enough and heavy enough to move into a ""Big Girl"" seat like her older sister. She loves the pretty pattern on the cover. We like that the armrests flip up/down to allow ease of buckling the seatbelt. We're also happy that we can easily move the seat out of the way if we need to use the seat for an adult. It would be nice if manufacturers included LATCH locks to hold the seat more firmly in place, just for some added safety. Also, when my daughter grows this seat will ""grow"" with her, but when the back is extended, the exposed section is at the bottom of the seatback and looks ugly because it is just plain plastic. My older daughter's Graco Booster grew at the headrest and the newly exposed section of ""growth"" was covered in matching fabric making the unit look more uniformed. May go looking for a Graco for the additional seats we'll need for Grandma/Grandpa's cars, and our second car."
3,Ok but flimsy,"This is a second booster for us. The first was a Graco and is a great car seat. This time I bought this model as it was $15 cheaper than the Graco and has additional storage space for the kid. However, it is very flimsy (back rotates) and the seat cover is not secured very well and it often slides off one of the sides."
5,Easy to assemble,"We ordered two of these for our 2 year old. One for each vehicle. Very affordable. The 8 month old was out growing his carrier car seat and the 2 year old was big enough, height and weight wise for the booster. So we were able to move our 8 month old to his brothers rear facing car seats.These were easy to assemble and our son loves that he has a big boy seat now!Thanks to all of you who reviewed before me. It helped me decide which seat to buy."
2,It's fine until kids fall asleep,"This high chair does not recline!When our little one fell asleep, his head dropped to the side straining his neck.We will be retuning this chair and will pick up the Graco High Back TurboBooster Car Seat for few dollars more, which does recline.2 stars for the cheap price."
2,Warning- Not reccomended for children younger than 3,"I purchased this seat at local retailer. My daughter met the height and weight requirements as posted on the outside of the box and the display, but when I opened it at home the installation instructions said she had to be three or older. I called the manufacturer and they confirmed the age requirement as of November 2007. I wish they would have posted it on the outside of the package."
2,Maybe I got a lemon...,"After reading all of these rave reviews I tried out this booster, and I couldn't be more disappointed. Maybe I just got a lemon, but it is SO unsturdy! It wiggles from side to side and just doesn't feel safe to me at all. The seat part is fine without the back, but obviously I need to use the back for a little while. Definitely not worth saving a few dollars."
4,Good Booster,The seat is just right for our 5yo. Easy to buckle her and easy to cahnge to another car as needed. The color also matches the interior of our car well. It is listed as birck/silver or something like that but it is black and gray/silver.
5,"great , confortable, safe ,pretty.",this is a great booster seat very soft and confortable also pretty very good features like 2 cup holders and space for snacks also you can strech the backrest sretchup and down this is a booter chair for long time besides all that is pretty and very girlie
3,"Good, but...",seems to fit well-shoulder strap goes across my daughter fine (she's 3 1/2). Easy to clean. Only don't like the fact that the sides of head rest do not go out far enough to catch her head when she falls asleep in the car on road trips. She slumps right over so I have to use a pillow to keep her propped up.
2,N.O.W.,"Nightmares on Wax ""In a Space Outta Sound"" is just ok. I am having a hard time justifying having paid almost $15 for this.That said, it's alright. It's kind of funky, groovy, cool electronica music with some hip-hop undertones.The main problem is that the songs never really go anywhere. The beats for the most part are really good, but the songs drag on and don't do a lot.After awhile it's tedious sitting through the entire 62 minutes. This might work better as background music.I'll probably end up trading this in. There's nothing that ""exciting"" or ""amazing"" here. Very average."
3,Rehash of basic web technologies,"I was disappointed in what this book had to offer. I was hoping for a full text of web exploits and how to defend against them. Instead the first half of the book covers information such as languages of the web and how to read URL's. It is as if the author assumes the reader has no knowledge of web technologies and systems. I am finding this to be a common problem with network security books, they are written for readers with little real knowledge of networking, let alone network security. Surly they sell many copies because ""hacking"" is in the title though.This is not the book for the serious IT professional, you would do better to look elsewhere for security insights."
1,A heart-rending disappointment,"I could barely muddle through this disjointed retellingof the Sherwood saga. The book came highly reccomended(by someone I will never trust again), and as such, itwas worth weeping when I discovered how truly awful itwas. To be brief, the sexual content isn't just graphic--it's downright disgusting. Feyrer's Robin Hood wascompletely lacklustre, and paled like a flashlight witha low-running battery compared to the full moon brightnessof Maid Marian. If you like the Robin Hood legend, keepyour impressions as they are. Thief's Mistress may ruinthe glory of Sherwood for you."
2,Disappointed,"When I ordered this dvd set, I remembered watching it as a teenager and couldn't recall anything inappropriate about it. However, after having watching the first disc, (as a parent) I realized that it had some things that could have easily been left out and still been a good show. The parents, Jason & Maggie Seaver, are a little overboard, in my opinion, about their intimacy as a married couple and in front of children, even teenagers, I think it is uncalled for. Also, the occassional language I find unnecessary. As a result, I will not be ordering further seasons."
3,could be better,"i enjoyed the dvds 2-4,but the first one will not play because it had to big scuffs in it"
5,A dream/prayer come true!,"I have been wanting this show on dvd ever since X-Files was put on dvd. I have been dreaming of having Growing Pains on dvd. It was literally the funniest, most imaginative comedy of the 80's. It's a timeless clasic that deserves to be imortalized ond dvd. I am going to pre-order this set. Thank you Warner Bro.!!!"
5,It's about time!,I've been waiting for this series to finally be released and my prayers have finally been answered. This series really brings back some fond and happy memories in my life. This is just about my favorite sit-com of all time along with Seinfeld and Cheers. Shame on them for taking this blasted long in releasing it. I'm counting the days till February 6th!!!
5,REST ASSURED: THIS SHOW HAS NOT DATED!,"My brother bought this set when it was released and, after watching only the first episode, I decided to buy a copy for myself. This is such a great show with an excellent cast. I was really impressed with how this show has not dated. Sure, it is very much of the 80's with many references and whatnot to that era, but overall, it is a timeless show.I was 12 when this was first on and it was one of my fave shows at the time. Having watched all of the eps in the set, I was surprised at how many fond memories it brought back and, at the same time, just how fresh all the episodes were.I especially loved the reunion special they added to this! One of the best SPECIAL features ever!Please, for anyone who remembers this show and has any doubts about adding it to their collections, DO NOT DELAY, BUY IT TODAY!Now, if only they'll hurry up and release the rest of the seasons!"
3,Excellent bonus material.,"The bonus material documentary was interesting to watch. In real life, all seemed close to the characters they played on the show, and they seemed to really respect one another."
4,Why can't t.v. be like this now?,"Great 80's show,I know when i was growing up i was addicted to this show, plus it has some good episodes as well."
3,Growing Pains - the Complete First Season,It was a simpler time....silly series but a pleasant change from some of the wilder fare these days. Great for tweens.
4,Thank you!,Thank you for releasing such a great show. What great memories of my childhood watching this. Can't wait for The Wonder Years!
5,Best learning songs for kids!,"I first heard this music when my older daughter was a year old. She was too young to appreciate anything but the beat, but she sure liked that! I located a copy this year, and my two kids absolutely love to sing along. At only 2, the younger one has absorbed many of the phonemes of the Spanish language thanks to this album.The kids like it so much that they request it about 50% of the time (and another album the other 50%). It's interesting enough for both parents to put up with the repetition, too (which is rare)!Charlotte Diamond is a real gem!"
4,Unusual and interesting,"This book is a collection of short pieces about every conceivable type of insect. A few are complete essays, but most are excerpts from longer works. At least one is a one-panel Gary Larson cartoon!Most of the selections are entertaining, or at least interesting. Many are records of direct observation by naturalists in the 19th or early 20th Centuries. Usually they have some distinguishing feature such as freakish behavior, first observation, or an exceptionally interesting experiment included.This is not a scientific book on insects--Although many of the authors are scientists, the excerpts don't fit together to make a textbook or organized survey of insects. What it is is very interesting and entertaining--A good bathroom or bedside book for the insect-lover. Definitely do not choose it as your first or only book in trying to learn about insects, but it makes a good addition to the insect library of an enthusiast."
1,Waste of time and money,If you do buy this book save the receipt so that you can send it back if you are disappointed like I was. No respectable publisher would ever publish this book.
1,SeaWorld Adventure Parks Shamu's Deep Sea Adventure,We never recived this at all what happened?? SeaWorld Adventure Parks Shamu's Deep Sea Adventure. How do you rate something you never got tell us!!! Doreen
3,Old Stories Retold,"In the Acknowledgments, the author mentions the ""endless research invovled in a project of this nature."" Yet, the majority of the stories in GHOSTS OF BOSTON TOWN were featured in Yankee Magazine and other publications many years' ago and I can locate them all in my living room within a few minutes! In other words, I had read these stories before and liked them much better the first time! In the few ""original"" stories in the book, the author refers to the locations as ""a two-bedroom apartment . . . in Somerville,"" or ""a house in Everett,"" and nothing irritates a reader of ""true"" ghost stories more than the failure to specify locations. I recommend this book only to those who are totally unfamiliar with Boston's oldest ghost stories."
1,Disappointing and a bit offensive,"Dont waste your time or money on this.The stories told in this book can easily be found in other books written by talented authors, such as David Pitkin. You will find such stories crafted much better and in original words, unlike here.I'm serious. If you already wasted your money, read about the Charles St Schoolhouse in Newburyport, MA. Then google for haunted schoolhouse, Newburyport and read the first article that comes up. It's a Yankee Magazine Foliage presentation, written by Ned Brown. And it borders on plagerism. It's offensive.This author also has no respect for varying social strata and often uses inappropriate labeling such as ""snooty"" to describe Boston's suburban towns.There's more, but this review has already stolen precious moments away from reading a decent book..."
4,Three Cheers,"I hadn't heard this album before I bought MCR's second album Three Cheers. I was absolutely astonished when I bought Bullets becasue the two are completely different. Bullets is a very raw and hard album. Three Cheers is more polished and not as heavy when it comes to the sound. The lyrics for both though speak volumes. If you are an MCR fan, or wanting to become one, this album is a necessity."
4,My Chemical Romance's First Strike,"My chemical romance's debut has the raw sound a debut album should have, unlike poseur bands that come out with a polished sounding debut from a major label. A few songs on this album aren't all that well written but the emotion is there to make up for it.Either way, if you're in need of fresh air, I recommend this album. These are the tracks I like most:""Honey, this mirror...""""Vampires will never hurt you""""Our lady of sorrows""""Early sunsets over Monroeville""""Demolition Lovers"""
5,The most outstanding band ever!,"ATTN: anyone with an ear for good music! this band is so powerful. their lyrics the melodys.....just great i did not buy the cd here at this site but i am tellin you to buy it here. this album is so extremly well put together.""head first for halos"" and ""demolition lovers"" 2 songs that need reganition big time i suggest MCR to any music fanatic or just anyone. the are the best. you deserve this cd buy it it is worth it.they rock! you will be in aww at the music and heart they put into their music if i could i would tell MCR myself they rock and have changed my lif ei love them and they rock !!!"
5,Another Chemical Romance,"If your looking for deep, eerie, and powerful music, this is the cd for you. Personally, Ive known My Chemical Romance since early 2003, before they started becomming mainstream, in other words: their BEST moments. Tracks such as Drowning Lessons, and Demolition Lovers demonstrate one extreme to another. From brutally drowning a beautiful bride to running away and dying in a hail of bullets with her, this cd is one of a kind. After all, all we are is bullets."
4,this 1 is for dw12,"This guy said that the only reason these guys were signed was because Thursday got big. Well if you didnt notice, this cd came out in the 2002. Thursday didnt get signed with island records untill 2003 and came out with their cd in october of 2003. so this cd is not just an answer to thursday. this cd is a must buy because it has great gutar riffs and lyrics."
1,HORRIBLE GARBAGE!,i can't believe that they got a major label deal based on this album. if you want some GOOD mcr check out three cheers for sweet revenge. that's a good album. don't get me wrong. i love this band. but this is just crap. there are no melodys...it sounds like it was recorded in one of the band member's bathrooms..and it's just heavy guitars and screaming about vampires and other hogwosh. skip this detour. i can't believe i bought this album hoping it would grow on me. it hasn't.
1,what a waste of time,"i bought this cd way back when i used to like mcr...and i picked this cd uplike one person said, this cd is very immaturish. its lyrics, its vocals, its music. all sounds too garage bandish to me.at first i liked the difference, then it hit me that his voice wasnt any better than the new cd, if not worse.i cant believe i wasted my money on this.pass this up and buy Undoing Ruin by Darkest Hour instead."
1,WHAT!!!,"The review below me says that MCR isnt mainstream. Wow now thats the mark of a uninformed person. Not only is MCR SUPEMELEY mainstream, but emo is just that...MAINSTREAM. Emo sells records, thats it. Remember if enough girls scream for your band, you will be big no matter how much you suck."
5,This is what they should sound like today,Out of all of there 3 cds this is by far the best one. raw and full of energy = great combination. This kicks the pants off the black parade and TCFSR. I was very shocked at how good this record was and who was the person that called MCR emo? I was going to pass this record but I heard a couple of songs from it and liked it. I am new to MCR so yes you can call me a poser because I use to hate this band with a passion but thats all changed. These guys just get a bad reputation is all. If you are new to MCR I would listen to a couple of songs first because this cd might take you a few listens to get into it. I love this cd from start to finish I just wish they could sound like this today but MTV completely changed all that.
5,MCR rocks!!!,"One word, AMAZING! This is a great cd. Some good tracks are Honey, this mirror isnt big enough for the two of us, Demolition lovers, and Our lady of sorrows. Great vocals and guitar, definatly worth buying!"
1,Vampires will not hurt but this cd [does],"Not catchy, not clever. I picked this one up on a recomendation and regret it. ...basically low end emo."
5,Fall on your tongue like pixie dust just think happy thought,"MCR has a really good cd, there isnt one song on there that sucks. They are also really cool guys, Mikey (drummer) signed my bastard t-shirt, and we talked. The second time i saw them Gerard (singer) held my hand during Vampires will never hurt you. I've loved them since the first time i heard them and i will always love them they are the best around. There coming out with a new cd."
5,~im not worthy~,that sounded gay but... this is a great cd MCR rox these cud all be singles but they wont (:D)great CD go buy!
3,This One Was Okay...,"I just have to say it, people who are completely degrading this album are complete idiots.You have your opinion and that is perfectly fine, but my opinion is that this album certainly was good, but could have been better.The two main songs that you really want to listen to, and should take the focus off of the others that have barely any rythem, are the first, called Romance, the third, called Vampires Will Never Hurt Ypu, and the last, called, Demolition Lovers.Out of the whole CD, I would say that those are the best songs."
2,Not my cup of tea...,"After going through it, nothing really strikes me personally. It blends together after a while. First track ""Romance"" with its static... it if was a metaphor then it was lost on me.The tracks ""Helena"" and ""I'm not okay"" on the last album brought me to this one, but I'm not into this at all.Each to his own I guess."
5,See them live!,"I liked a couple of MCR's songs...that was before i saw them headline the London Earls' court Give it a Name Tour 2006...and let me tell you, they are one of my favorite bands. I was sketchy about buying their cds in the past...no more! I am sold! GO SEE THEM LIVE!!! They put on one hell of a concert."
5,My Chemical Romance is all you need...,"Sorry to Kramer from Iowa, but if you don't like the CD, keep it to yourself and keep yourself from upsetting the rest of the world, because we are cool, MCR is cool, and you are a loser if you don't love these guys. The first song I heard was on my roommates PC, ""Thank You for the Venom"", track 7 on ""Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge"" and I instantly knew that I had a favorite band... Now, I can't stop thinking about the band, I feel that every song they have (whether the lyrics apply or not)has a sound that fits every mood you could feel. And for the music lover like me, they are all you ever need."
5,Better than Three Cheers,"I went out and bought Three Cheers like everybody else after hearing the song ""Im not okay"" and it was a pretty good album that became popular real fast. Then I saw the video for ""Honey, This Mirror Isn't Big Enough For the Two Of Us"" and I really like this MCR so I bought this CD and am very much satisfied. The greatest thing about this CD is that it was produced by Geoff Rickley of Thursday, Thursday being one of my fav bands, so I knew it would be awesome. This CD is much more darker and heavier than three cheers, which is a good thing to me, but not to pop princesses out there. I enjoy the lyrics and every song is listenable, I recommend this CD to people who like THursday."
3,It doesn't really sound like My Chemical Romance.,"This doesn't really sound like the kind of music MCR would make. It's a little too loud and dark for their kind of style. I really wouldn't buy this album, but I would buy all of their other albums. Take it from a true MCR Fan!!"
4,A Beautiful Soundtrack for a Beautiful Story,"Camelot is by far my favorite musical. And, although the story is a beautiful one, like any good Broadway musical it's the songs and music that really make it memorable. This take on an old legend really stirs the emotions, and the soundtrack lets you relive those moments again and again. You smile to yourself at the forshadowing in ""The Simple Joys of Maidenhood"", you laugh at Lancelot's ""humility"" in ""C'est Moi"" and the clever puns in ""The Lusty Month of May"", you appreciate poor Arthur's confusion in ""How to Handle a Woman"", you experience the ups and downs of ""The Joust"", you admire Arthur's loyalty to his friends in ""Resolution"", your heart breaks for the lovers in ""I Loved You Once In Silence"", you feel Guinevere's shame and Arthur's desparation in ""Guinevere"", and finally you feel just a little hope through the tears during the ""Finale""."
3,Who thought this works??,"I bought this unit because I really want this concept to work. I've tried many others, and they went directly to the thrift stores. I was hopeful about this, because of the positive reviews, but was again disappointed.Pros: Heat was just GREAT. They aren't kidding that it keeps the water hot, and I was very impressed with that.Cons: Too shallow (as they all are), so no ankle treatment.Ineffective massage. Must be expecting too much. Noise and vague jittering, but nothing theraputic.Bubbles are utterly worthless. Why do I always think you might really be able to feel them?All in all, you might want to buy this unit if you want a pleasant and very warm, shallow foot bath. I would pay much more to get a unit that would really feel like a water massage, and would cover my ankles. I've certainly thrown enough away on these things over the years."
3,All I Can Say Is This,"If you enjoy As I Lay Dying's ""Shadows Are Security"" or Still Remains' ""Of Love And Lunacy"", you'll enjoy this. If you dislike both CD's, however, you will no doubt hate this. This is just a more-of-the-same metalcore release. Sounds very similar musicwise and vocal-wise to both bands. They may incorporate more singing than AILD, but still, that doesn't change much. You'll be the judge on this one."
2,As I Lay Dying Rip-off...,"Now don't get me wrong, these guys are kinda talented but they sound exactly like As I lay Dying. If it wasn't for the dudes singing voice i would've thought this band WAS As I Lay Dying when I heard them. Their unoriginality scars this album. I think they should use their talents and make something different (Like He Is Legend, Norma Jean, Far-Less, and people like that did). If you're looking for something new and different I think you should check out the bands i metioned in the parenthesis.The art is nice though..."
1,Please enter a title for your review,"I can honestly say I've never heard a more faceless derivitve band in my life. They're mimics, they just digest formulas and regurgitate them. That's why the metalcore scene is largely worse than the nu-metal scene it's replaced, the bands all play the same riffs. It's all about demonstrating your wannabe metal playing techniques, there are no hooks. It's got to the point that i'd actually give people props for choosing to listen to the new Papa Roach instead of this."
3,Venom gets a tad better...,"Well for one thing we've got better art in this collection - why couldn't Paco Medina draw the whole series??? - but we've also got some dumb characters in the form of Frankie and Vic, and guess what... they're CLONES! Yuck. Anyway, we do however get the overly exposed Wolverine, who actually provides some comic relief every now and again in the ""RUN"" arc. All in all, pretty good stuff, if you ignore the clones.Herrara returns in ""Patterns""... Pro: we finally see Eddie Brock again. Con: crappy art. It's pretty cool to see Venom square off against the Fantastic Four and the scene where Spider-Man expresses fear of the symbiote in its captive state. Besides that, though, we get all this conspiracy crap that Bruce Jones seems to love doing over on ""Hulk"".All in all, not too bad. The best of this series can be found in the next collection, ""Twist"", which has some classic moments between Spidey and Venom."
5,Still I Rise,"This poem gives you the strength to deal with lifes situations when being talked down and trampled on by others.I't gives you hope and the will to rise above all situations that we may go through in life.I rise!Cassandra DillonAuthor of ""Reality Poems""."
1,Dissapointed !,"I'm a fan of Maya Angelou autobiographical novels and expected to be a fan of her poetry as well. I'm not. I thought the poems trite, cliched, and just plain bad, lazy poetry. I felt. . .cheated. Needless to say, I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone."
2,Poor binding and overall physical book quality. NO reflection on the poetry.,"I bought one for me and one as a gift, but the pages were uneven and the binding fragile with a dented cover on one of the two. For the price, I expected a sturdier book. I wonder if I just got defective ones. I've seen poorly made books sold at outlet bookstores. The two I received wouldn't last long before they fell apart.I'm a huge fan of her work, so I'll be hitting the bookstores ASAP to find sturdier versions of the same collection."
5,Just what she wanted....,"This collection was purchased as a Christmas gift. My daughter is a Maya Angelou fan, and she wanted a book of her own. This was definitely a hit on Christmas morning."
1,Most Over-Rated American Poet,Maya Angelou is a media creation. Her fame is fed by her image rather than her writing. If you'd like to read a GOOD African American female poet check out Rita Dove or Lucile Clifton or Gwendolyn Brooks.
2,The Cover Is The Best Part Of This Book,"I was raised to believe that if you can't say something nice about someone you shouldn't say anything at all, so whenever I deliver up a negative review on someone's work, I feel slightly guilty. That admitted, well, basically I'll only offer this: I did not care for Ms. Angelou's poetry very much. However, were I to continue on with this review, I might also add that I failed to discern her talent or feel much of a personal tie to her cultural awareness or her message. I might even conclude (were I not stopping at what I wrote up above) by confessing that even the range of her vocabulary (or should I say the lack of a range) failed to impress me. I don't think Maya Angelou deserves the high praise she gets on an almost universal level and have my own opinion as to why she receives so much of it.Just my view..."
3,Half and Half.,"I breezed through this one, and I have to say her autobiographies are far superior to her poems. I didn't even have the heart to understand most of them. The style is not exactly what I can call ""delicious"". I'm just not a fan of Maya when it comes to poetry. BUT I have to say I enjoyed the poems in ""I Shall not be Moved"". They just contained a different flavor in them. One can easily tell that she had grown when she wrote these ones. (I'm assuming it's her latest of all the other poetry books). Or maybe she just put more effort into it, or perhaps just decided to use a different style. I liked ""On the Pulse of Morning"" as well."
5,From the founder of the Phenomenal Women Of The Web,"Maya Angelou is by far one of the most gifted women of the world. She brings all the elements of being human to the surface. As the founder of the Phenomenal Women Of The Web, it was Maya Angelou - the words and feelings she invoked in me - that lead me to create the organization. I have sold hundreds of copies of this book on my site - along with the audio tapes. To hear Maya speak the words of the poem ""Phenomenal Woman,"" is to truly feel your spirit come alive. I highly recommend this book to any person with a heart."
1,Too tight water pants...,"Maybe I'm a little fat, but these extra large trunks are more like small to mediums. It is not worth it to me to return them."
4,Andy lives on.,"This tape offers many new insights and largerly unseen footage on Warhol that anyone seriously interested in Andy Warhol would want to see.Bob Colacello's presence also adds to the commentary, though Fred Hughes is noticeably absent."
3,has a few moments...,this dvd features some footage which makes it worth having for a Warhol fan...I found the music to be ( though no doubt well intentioned ) very distracting and ill-conceived...
1,Pop Flop,"I own at least four other Andy Warhol DVD documentaries and this is the worst one I have ever seen. Everything about this DVD is poor quality from the bad music, DVD menus, story line and ending with horrible camera work, don't waste your time watching this DVD. The PBS Warhol documentary is so much better."
2,Colors do not match,"The color of the belt in the picture look yellow (I thought I was), but it is dark beige, I am dissapointed!!!"
1,After some work...,"The table and stools where not the easiest to assemble being that the screws where not long enough to properly attached the pieces. Fortunately, for me I am a tool savoy person and was able to make eveything work out without having to send anything back. Once it was set up I thoroughly enjoy seeing and using it. Sadly, I would not recommend that you buy this product, because I have a feeling that my table was not the only one botched up."
5,Some Things That Stay,This is really a good coming of age movie. Geraint Wyn Davies is really good as the neighbor of this girl. I bought this movie because he is in this movie.
5,good book for begginner or above,I got this book to learn about caring for indoor plants for a new business it is very insightful and helpful. I do mostly pest control in buildings and often am asked about the plants and problems they may have this book is a good help in answering questions and learning about the different plants and how to manage them. Maybe for experinced people this maybe basic info but is helpful. My wife really liked it with help for plants in the house.
3,Non Fiction,"Basically what it says, a just ok dictionary. It is small, and has pictures, so if you want a quick guide, or one that is handy and portable for looking up major topics of interest, then this book will do nicely.It was also very reasonably priced where I bought it, compared to some."
4,My wife loves it!!,My wife loves Fine Cooking!! We've subscribed to many others and Fine Cooking is the one we renew - Keep up the good reading!
3,disappointing,"I'm very disapointed in this magazine. It's not really ""FINE cooking"" at all; it's everyday fare. I was hoping for something with more of a gourmet touch. The content is pretty lean."
5,Fantastic magazine - tons of great recipes!,"My husband and I have thoroughly enjoyed this magazine. The recipes are varied and well written with beautiful pictures. They include interesting information about ingredients and reviews about kitchen gadgets. We have a ton of recipes in our usual rotation from this magazine. I like that the recipes range from easy to very difficult, so you can pick exactly how much effort you're willing to put in on a particular day. We are looking forward to enjoying Fine Cooking for many years to come!"
4,Great magazine for cooks at all levels,"Fine Cooking is a great magazine for people who like to cook, and have a grasp of the basics, but want to broaden their horizons. They break down some of the more intimidating cooking techniques & make them much more accessible. Highly recommended!"
3,Great for educational purposes...but...,Great for my sons education. He loves rearranging the letters and spelling things....but the magnets on some of the letters are falling off after the first 2-3 months. I have to watch him when he plays with them now to make sure he does not swallow any. I am thinking I might just remove all the magnets and let him play with them that way....
3,Awesome,"Just as described, brand new I thought this movie was going to be interviewed by the actors of the brat pack, but it was really good I enjoyed it, since its kinda of a tribute to Hohn hughes"
3,Any Extras?,"As the other 3 reviewers have stated, this is a small treasure for those of us who happened to experience our high school years right along with the creations of Mr. Hughes. I must also echo that there was more attention paid to the filmmakers than I would have liked, but the interviews that are available here are more than I had ever hoped to see in one place.I saw this on Netflix Instant and couldn't help but wonder: are there any extra interviews included on the actual disc? If so, I may be inclined to purchase."
1,Forget about buying this,Not worth the $5.99 I paid for it. Rent it or watch it online first before you buy. I had a hard time staying awake.
2,Cheap Saran wrap folders,"I just got my 2 free after rebates, and I'm glad they were free. My other older cases are Case Logic and I've had them for years with only a few tears. Those cases are sturdy and have a good quality of plastic. These Xtreme cases are so cheap, they're like something I would make out of my garage. Seriously, the plastic is like Saran wrap. There were already some torn jacket covers before I even put anything it them. And plan on tearing more if your jacket is any thicker than a few sheets. Pass these up and pony up for Case logic cases; you'll be glad you did."
2,Only as good as its weak zipper,"The body of this case is sturdy, all right, but the nylon zipper isn't up to the challenge. It's easy to stress the zipper because when you open this case it won't lie flat unless you push the zipper tab impossibly far into the spine with the tips of your fingers. But this isn't even how my zipper failed, because it failed from a closed position. Once the zipper splits, it absolutely fails to self-heal -- no matter how carefully you re-mate it, it will split again in an instant. Now I have about 100 CDs that I have no secure home for until I buy a replacement case."
1,Broken zipper within weeks!,"We bought the 320 holder. The zipper broke within weeks! This means you can't carry or store the thing unless it's flat. So, basically the money we spent on it is in the toilet. Guess you get what you pay for. We'll be buying a quality case now."
5,Great CD holder!,It holds a whole bunch of CDs or DVDs-I bought 2 and use one for each. One is our travel movies for the kids. We have several road trips planned for this summer and I'm certain making their favorites more mobile will really pay off. It Zips closed so no worries of any falling out.
3,Can't beat it with a stick,"Literally, you CAN'T beat this with a stick because it's soft side, but for $5 after rebates I must say...the ripstop canvas is durable and of high quality, although the zipper could use a litle beefing up. The pockets for the CDs are tuff.I would buy it even at the current $15 AR price. It makes it a LOT easier to carry around 1/3 of my CD collection than if I hadda use those 32 disc deals."
1,FRAUD -- Don't count on a rebate,"Like a previous reviewer, I purchased this item with a rebate attached. Now I find my rebates have been denied because of an ""incorrect UPC code"". There is only one UPC code on the item; how can I have sent them the wrong one? Although I plan on continuing to fight this, I wholeheartedly recommend you reconsider purchasing this item. The real kicker is their line on the rebate form ""Warning: Fraudulent submission could result in federal prosecution under mail fraud statutes."" I wonder if I can get them prosecuted."
1,Rebate issues,Like previous reviewers I also bought the 320 CD case within the specified timeline (I bought mine on Dec. 13th). I submitted my rebate form with the original and only UPS code that came with the case on the date I received it (Dec 22). I received an e-mail today stating the UPC code was invalid. What a bunch of crap. I'm going to keep fighting for my rebate. I think this is the way they planned it so people will actually buy their garbage products. I've learned my lesson. I will never buy another TechB product.
4,Rebate is very slow to process,"This is a good product and they offer good price after rebate. However, on the rebate form they said you should receive your rebate within 8 weeks, I haven't receive my after more than 13 weeks (I bought three different products from them and none rebate have been received yet!). Good luck with your rebate"
1,Piece of Junk,"The product is flimsy and the zipper is terrible. You would be happy with any other brand. The fabric that lines the outside of the case is fraying and the stitching is coming apart. I've only used it a couple of months. Definitely not worth it. Also, don't fall for the rebate trick if they offer it, you will not get your money back."
2,a little friendly advice,"There's nothing especially wrong with this case that a week's airing out won't solve. The plastic smells pretty bad at first. What really bothers me though is that the re. bate is more than a little fishy. I ordered it through am prime and it still took quite a while, but not that long. I sent in the re. bate app promptly. It is good for orders from aug through end of year. It is not a month yet since I ordered it, and it must be sent in within 30 days.Yet, guess what? I get a mssg today: in valid purchase date. My advice: if you think these are worth full price, get them. if not...."
1,This book itself is a disaster,"A bad movie script from a good director. This is a propoganda book which shows turkish people as monsters and armenian terorists as heroes. An attempt to brain wash the world. It creates its own fictious history, detached from all scientific facts and tries to create a one sided public opinion. I don't believe it is made to contribute to the creation of dialogue between armenian and turkish people. The litterature and art is sacrified for propoganda."
5,Mavis feels so very familiar,"Growing up 50 minutes east of Fargo with plenty of family in North Dakota, the characters and places all feel very real to me. To be truthful, I've hung out at ""The Office"", shopped at Hornbacher's and understand that West Fargo is different from Fargo. When Brenda writes about the North Dakota sky, I don't have to imagine, I just remember. Her prose is poetic, her characterizations full, and her story wonderfully told.Thank you, Brenda!"
1,Terrible,"Amazon's vehicle/part matching program told me this would fit my 93 honda prelude, 2.2L VTEC, yet when I received the part and attempted to install it I realized the fittings for the belt tensioners were missing, rendering the part useless. In addition, the part felt lightweight and a little flimsy. I guess you get what you pay for. I will never be using amazon's part match program again. Also, I received this product in September, realized it was not the right part in October, and now in January have yet to receive any refund for the product."
3,Pretty nice calendar,"This calendar is nice but it needs more for the children, like more redeemable coupons and activities. On the other side is very handy and compact. I will still recommend this calendar but would like for it to be done some improvements in the future, but do buy it now because is worth the money."
3,Good but there are better books out there,"While this book certainly has a few tips that are good to learn, there are better books out there. With an eye-catching cover and interface, I thought this book was great at first blush but upon really trying to use it more, the tips are annoyingly obvious and things that you would figure out how to do without direction (ex. freezing lemon slices for drinks- slice as you would and stick in the freezer; keep batter from splattering out of an electric mixer- cover the mixer with a towel). Especially if you have other works from the Christopher Kimball/America's Test Kitchen oeuvre, this book will simply feel repetitive. A much better (more informative, better laid out, and truly interesting) book is David Joachim's Brilliant Food Tips and Cooking Tricks."
3,Not the best,I purchased this to see what things I could do to help make my time in the kitchen more efficient but I must say that I was disappointed. A lot of stuff in here doesn't cover what I would have thought it would. There are things that I thought were just silly and others that I knew I would never try. I still use a few ideas from this book every now and then but thats about it.
4,From kitchen MacGruber to MacGyver with this book,"For anyone that subscribes to Cooks Illustrated, this is a great compilation of a lot of the hints and tricks that are included in each issue. The book is organized alphabetically so if you want tips on most ingredients, you just flip to that section. It also has quite a few items listed under ""kitchen efficiency"" and include everything from storing boxes of foil to cleaning up spilled oil.Some of this is stuff you know - like using toothpicks to transport a pie with whipped cream on it or chilling the bowl in which you're about to make whip cream. . But other stuff I never would have thought of - putting a mini marshmellow in the bottom of an ice cream cone to keep it from dripping or cutting cinnamon rolls with dental floss - are helpful, cheap, and brilliant.This book will change you from the MacGruber to the MacGyver of your kitchen. Well worth it!"
5,Well made. Cute designs.,Nice and thick with a comfortable fit and good buckle. Cute designs make it seem less medical and more fashionable. Good price for the quality.
5,Best Christmas gift ever,My dad gave this dark Blue BikeBoard to me for christmas after I asked for a skatebaord. At first I was wondering why no skateboard but after riding it I love it and all my friends want one. it is cool being one of the first Bikeboard surfers on my street. I am learning new tricks all the time.

3,adequate Arkangel performance,"Listening to the Arkangel rendition was better than cold reading, but the characterizations were not nearly as consistent as in other performances."
3,Great little bag,"Nice little bag. Great for biking or a long walk. Side pouch, though deep, it is not wide, even for a tiny SONY ERICSSON phone. Material gets stained very easily."
3,"Nice grill, odd clips","The grill is quite sturdy for the price. I dropped my sub yesterday and it sustained the merest dent versus catastrophic damage to the speaker. The clips, though, are odd. They don't seem deep enough for a top mount, but they're far too deep for the bottom mount approach I took. I had to manually saw them down to size to hold the grill tight. Without this modification, the grill would have rattled like mad. For this price, it's a good grill, but expect to have to tweak things a bit."
3,Norelco blades,this product did not seem to hold a sharp edge. Soon after installing in my razor they were dull. I would not reorder.
3,Not much better than the original,"Have had a Norelco shaver for many years. Decided to replace the blades. First tried a substitue alternate source. Waste of money. Then back to Norelco, for the real thing. Ordered HQ4's, got HQ55, which the box says replaces the HQ4. New and Improved. Perhaps, but the shave isn't quite as close or as smooth as the 15 year old blades on the original shaver. Perhaps they will improve with time. I expected more from Norelco."
4,Use them all the time,"I hesitiated to buy these bibs ater I read the first reveiw, but I am so glad I did. Although the description is incorrect and the bibs are tie not velco closure, this is a plus for our little girl who loves to pull her bib off. These bibs are super-easy to clean in the sink or the washing machine. They have not stained, and have held up very well through numerous washings. The only reason I don't give this bib a 5 is because the neck opening is large, and collars can sometimes get messy. Over all the best bib I've found for keeping laps and sleeves clean and dry. I'm ordering more."
2,Don't stay tied!,"Good coverage to protect long sleeves, but the tie back slips right out and leaves the collar/neck area open. Need to double knot or secure in some other way. I wouldn't buy them again, but don't feel like paying postage to send them back."
4,bathtub shelf,"This is a very good bathtub shelf. My daughter likes to have cups of water when in the bath for fun and instead of using the bathtub ledge, I bought this, so we wouldn't get water all over the floor. It is perfect for this. Of course, it is good for putting shampoo and soap as well as kid toyos. I recommend this! thank you."
1,didn't stay up,bummer ! we ended up giving it to Goodwill - it wasn't wide enough for us and it got knocked down at the slightest whisper of movement.
3,Not like the old ones,The shelf is good for narrow bathtubs only. In our tub it does not extend far enough to go across anywhere but at the very back. Defeats the purpose of having it. I am looking for another one.
2,Unless someone is making you buy it...,"Don't! This book is poorly written, difficult to interpret, full of typos, and just generally a waste of the cognitive resources Sudman talks about the precious scarcity of. It is repetitive, long-winded, and poorly organized, leaving the reader wondering what the authors were even trying to say. The information within this book, though, is critical to understanding good survey construction. If you can find an outline or abbreviated version of this information hold onto it!"
5,Great suckers!,I love Jolly Rancher candy and was excited to get these lollipops. They are big and last a long time. I just wish I could find the sour Jolly Rancher suckers also. I would buy this again.
5,great,"sounds fantastic in my satriani model, noticed immediate difference and still am figuring out new tone settings from slight adjustments, highly recommend"
1,Melissa and Doug Dalmation,"This stuffed animal is very plush, life-sized, and realistic. I am elderly and disabled. It is the perfect pet for me. It is suitable for all ages. Melissa and Doug stuffed animals are truly amazing."
3,its okay,"not sure how this product gets great reviews...my initial impression was that it was fairly poor quality, but it has held up to a few weeks of being dragged around to various ""emergencies"" by my firefighting 4 and 6 year olds. for the money, it does the job. not disappointed, not thrilled. i think its okay...they would give it 5 stars."
1,Squeaky Dalmation,This dog came soiled and it squeaks when you touch its head. Very disappointed! I guess everyone else got a good product from Mellisa and Doug. No luck what so ever for me.
3,Too generic,"I have several of Vicki Black's books. This is the one that I would like to be very specific about both the history of the BCP and how to use it. But really most of the chapters are generalized introductions to the Anglican Church itself, and to the Eucharist, and the church calendar, and other topics she deals with in other books. There is only one chapter on how to use the BCP to perform the offices, and that chapter isn't very clear. There are a few helpful bits referring the reader to specific page numbers in the BCP for certain things, but very little explanation on how the BCP is organized. It would be nice to have a numbered list of how to go through the daily offices, to lay it out clearly."
5,Great introduction,"This book is a great introduction and explanation of what the Book of Common Prayer is all about. It's helpful to have when reading The Book of Common Prayer and are unsure of the exact meaning of the sections, this book explains."
3,augmentation,"This recording has some of Tailleferre's best works. Some of the tracks on this recording, however, seem too slow for my taste. I recommend the 1993 German recording of her chamber music if you can find it."
3,Expensives!,"I bought this shoes, are really nice and fit well done. At six months the sole of the left shoe damaged without apparent reason. Nice shoes but expensives, I could pay at least US$40.00."
3,"It's ok, but stinks!","I don't have problem with this ball's quality. It's actually pretty strong to hold a heavy person. But the pump comes with it is a piece of junk. It broke right after I used it the first time (luckily it broke after the ball is filled). And the whole ball/package stinks very bad, mostly from the organic solvent when they make plastic/rubber. It stinks so bad that I don't even want my kid to be near this ball. And after one week I can still smell the solvent. I will suggest not to use it right after you open the package, instead, put it outdoors or somewhere that has ventilation and get rid of those solvent as much as possible then you start using it. Otherwise, you know you breath in more air when you are excercising, right? Those solvent are usually carcinogent."
1,leaky,"Spiced up my workout, nice package (includes tape measurer to ensure proper inflation). Inflated with with tire inflator from black and decker (highly reccomend).. so it was a breeze. But, sprang leak after about of week... sent it back. The spell was a bit weird, but tolerable."
3,Good for the price,"I got this as a replacement for my chair at work. It works well, just seems like it constantly loses air. And it reeks. But I guess that's what you get with plastic. It's nice tho. Haven't checked out the dvd but everything works well so far."
3,More Plasitc crap from China but works,This is very thin ball from china but does work. THe crap china pump even worked good enough to fill a second china exercise ball when its china crap pump did not work. Why do we even mess with stuff and junk from china? cause its cheap and we do not care about quality. Would have liked to see it made some place else but it was not. It is a low quality plastic ball that everyone seems all too happy to pay too much for.
4,Great way to get back in shape,"This ball and exercise video are great for working out at home, especially if you're loathe to sign gym membership contracts and spend time in the ""meat market"". Be sure to watch the video at least the first few times because the accompanying poster doesn't show all the moves nor specific instructions. The video instructor is very helpful; she's soft-spoken with a mild Australian accent. Unfortunately, the background music is pretty lame; better suited to a meditation/yoga video, so you might want to have your own mixed CD playing. Also, be sure to get a yoga mat for stability, and some moves may require extra cushioning for knees and hands."
5,Wordplay Great,"What an enjoyable movie. It reminded me of the old Bruce Brown movies, ""Endless Summer"", and, ""On Any Sunday"". This movie is even more enjoyable when you watch it with the comentary on."
4,dead-tree puzzles included...,"An irresistibly breezy documentary surveying the subculture of New York Times crossword puzzle enthusiasts who worship at the temple of Will Shortz. Clinton, Dole, and Jon Stewart are along for the ride as we follow a handful of obsessive puzzle-solvers on their way to the American Crossword Puzzle Championship. Generous special features also, including five actual ""unforgettable"" dead-tree crosswords and a DVD featurette about each one."
5,Wordplay,A very good documentary about a seemingly trivial hobby. A must see DVD if you are into cross word puzzels.
4,You gotta love word nerds,"This documentary just makes the average Joe wonder whatever happened to their smart chip. The only puzzles I can solve are those Hollywood pop culture thingys. The junk I fed my brain. But after watching this, I want my smart chip back. I'm horrible with Jeopardy, Scrabble, and definitely cross word puzzles. This was an interesting doumentary in the sense that I didn't know that there were so many people sooo involved in this past time. This just goes to prove that anything can be addictive. Anything."
4,Funny ... and informative,"I've never completed a crossword puzzle in my life and I still enjoyed this movie. It is interesting, has a good story, and has some clever comedic moments, especially the interview bits with the Daly Show's Jon Stewart and the comment letters people write to Will Shortz telling him how horribly difficult his NY Times crossword puzzles are."
2,A pictorial review of Barbara Stanywk,This was more or less a picture review of the life of the star Barbara Stanywk. There was not as much subtance to this bio as I would have preferred.
4,Comforting,"Life is an ongoing process of creation taken from pg 98. Not a book you can hurry through, nor would you want to. Lots of little gems in this one. Nice to leave out on your tabletop. You can pick it up anytime."
2,I don't like this book,This book was suggested to me by a friend. I found that this book was quite contradictory.
2,Meditations? Who can meditate the human being?,"This is a good book for looking to life in a happy way. But there is a major failure here, since 'Why are we living?' question should be asked to 'GOD' -Who created the all universe & all human beings- and we should look for the message from theGOD. Not we should just imagine & go into our way. And accordingly we should ask 'What is our greatest happiness?' question to the GOD.Anyone like this Meditations from Conversations with God, I advise Risale-i Nur Kulliyati (The Nur Collection) by Said Nursi Bediuzzaman to completely understand & learn 'WHY ARE WE LIVING on earth? and WHAT IS THE AIM & GREATEST HAPPINESS OF LIFE?."
3,A little too light for me,"I received this book in a timely manner and inexcellent condition. My disapointment was dueto my personal expectations and nothing else.It is a nice little book. Nothing eye opening,profound or different enough for me.I love the three CONVERSATIONS WITH GOD, I amreading them all again for the fourth time andit is always like the first, never ending. Myintention is to re-read them on into eternity.I smile and feel good when I think about thatand if I should get too old, I will have some-one read them to me and I'll still be smiling."
5,wow,"worth twice the price of purchase!! what entertaining sounds....could easily be my favorite purchase of the year..he really gives a good twist to a lot of songs here & if you can sit still while this one plays ""you ain't got no soul""...it's no wonder glen frey{eagles} was involved in this....lot of similar sounds....love his touch on 'rollin 'n tumblin'.....check it out"
5,A wonderful re-make of an old gospel song-GREAT!!!,I heard him on a radio program (Mark & Brian) singing live.He has an awsome voice.I can't wait to get the C.D.
3,OK- Audrey Tautou was the best part,"This film isn't bad, but...Audrey Tautou was the best part. The actors are great, but the story drags a bit. I don't know for sure if this was a made for tv movie, but it definitely feels like it is. I guess I was expecting more of an exciting who done it film, not a Columbo type tv movie. It was okay. The actors save it. I guess I just wasn't thrilled by the story in general and the way it was executed. However, if you like Audrey and French Cinema in general, it is an entertaining movie."
2,too dark of a movie,"Very dark movie about immigrants to UK trying to get a passport so they can come to the USA. Lead actor was very good, this was a sad sick, depressing movie"
2,SAXR25,"The SAXR25 is great when it works. Provides excellent results in slim, reasonably priced unit. However, if it breaks like mind did, you're in for a read surprise. To date, my unit has been with Panasonic for 90 days and still isn't fixed. Their customer service is terrible; they simply string you along. They will honor the 1 year parts & labor warrantee, however you will be without an entertainment system until it gets fixed, and they don't offer any alternatives. Better have a backup plan if you purchase ANYTHING from Panasonic. It could take a year to fix it and that is completely within the scope of the warrantee. Apparently satisfied customers are not a priority with Panasonic."
2,mixed feelings,"i have the same problem as other reviewers.the sound becomes garbled when viewing a dvd or in tv mode.if i change tv channels or in dvd mode switch input the sound comes back but it will become garbled again soon after.some days no problems at all though.panasonic has had my receiver in their repair shop more than i have had it my home!another matter that irks me is the remote.early on i discovered that i could not""fast forward""a dvd with the buttons that the manual said would perform this function."
3,Nice Overall - With One MAJOR flaw,"I've had my unit for about four years. It's a nice unit, good sound, looks good, etc. I'm not going to get all technical and analytical. But I'm just reading the reviews here now where people are having the sound cut out and have to switch the input back and forth to get it back. I've been having the exact same problem since I can remember. Some days it might not do it at all, other days it seems to flip out and do it every minute or so. I emailed Panasonic last year and they said to power it down, etc. etc., which I had already tried. I don't know what the problem is but I'd recommend staying clear of it if it's as common a problem as it appears to be here."
5,more than a summer read,"great new york story! not so much trendy as it is current, and real. a must read."
2,Drug induced ramblings,"This book was a waste of my time. The main charachter, Lee, was so strung out on drugs and/or her own manic depressive behavior that its very difficult to find sympathy to her struggles. She spends every cent she earns or is gifted on drugs or stupidity. Her life (which never seemed very 'glamerous' to me, but then again, I've never been a druggie so perhaps I can't relate) is a disaster from the get go and has no redeeming values. The plot of this book is slow to non-exsistant and the incoherentness of the main charachter makes whatever plot there is nearly impossible to follow let alone get into."
3,A very good start.,"Libaire's first novel is a very good start in the world of fiction but, I confess, not my cuppa tea. Young woman aspiring artist with many privileges goes to pot in glamorously hip NYC in the semi-aftermath of her mother's death. The protagonist's voice is clear and unique (in my experience), the dialogue is excellent. The book's representation of hedonist, druggy, downtown restaurant/club life in Manhattan is somewhat picturesque but I can't see why anyone would WANT to write this story. I must be missing something because the book is blurbed by BOTH Anthony Bourdain and Katharine Weber whose writing I admire."
5,Beautiful & Gritty,"If you are looking for some typical ""fluffy"" romance dribble, look elsewhere. This novel takes the reader through both the grimey muck and the sunny joys of life and love in the city. At some points you want to smack the main character (Lee), other times you feel genuine sympathy, and at other moments you want to go party with her; quite a rollercoaster of a read.While it is no Tao-te Ching, the author provides plenty of depth in character development and vivid imagery; a quick, poetic read. Well worth the $, I'd say."
1,john leguizamo is a phallus,"as a fellow latino myself, i found mambo mouth to be a poor showcase of john leguizamo and his acting abilities. Good latino actors like john are hard to find and need better showcases for their talent than pieces of garbage like this. If you want to see a funny movie with john leguizamo, then you are out of luck, because none exist."
4,original,"upfront style of writing, open to street language. The auto critic of the latino world was interesting.For us french students it was a good way to approach the different cultures in presence in New york.We were also very interested by the way of using spanish and english together as we do the same with french and english. END"
5,EXCELENT FOR ME,THIS WAS JUST WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR. I BOUGHT SOME WEIGHTS AND DIDN'TKNOW TOO MUCH ABOUT LIFTING BUT THIS BOOK AND DVD GETS RIGHT TO THE POINTWITH THE PROPER WAY OF WORKING OUT. IT WAS WELL WORTH IT'S PRICE.
2,Basic Principles of Pointe with Patricia Dickinson,"The content in this DVD is very accurate and encompasses all I know about dancing on pointe. However, the quality of the DVD is very poor. The picture scrambles and gets fuzzy from time to time making viewing difficult and frustrating. It's like the speed of the DVD is not accurate. I might suggest the Production Company consider making future editions of this DVD with better quality. Although the content is great, knowing then what I know now, I wouldn't pay the somwhat high price tag due to the poor viewing quality."
3,"OK, but not great.","The book tries to cover too much territory. Over four years of life is crammed into just over 200 pages. That does not allow for much detail. While there are some nice anecdotes hiding in the pages, it is mostly ""went here, saw this, did that, went on to the next place"".The book is written by a sailor for sailors. If you don't know a jib from a rode, or why broaching is a bad thing, or any number of other nautical terms, you will be lost and confused. I'm interested in sailing, but not a sailor so most of the jargon went right over my head. After a while some of it started to sink in, but the author assumes the audience is familiar with nautical terms and sailing techniques. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but limits the audience the book will appeal to.While the author starts out as an inexperienced sailor, he seems to have forgotten that by the time the book was written. We are not part of this learning curve from sailing neophyte to salty dog."
2,By Way of Not-So-Great Writing,"I read sailing books because I am a sailor and I love reading about sailing. I do not read sailing books with the expectation that I will encounter great writing or even good writing. However, my appreciation for a sailing book is contingent on the writing not getting in the way. I found Moore's references to his wife as ""the mate"" distracting. This coupled with rather superficial naratives left me bored and not wanting to finish the book...which is a rare occurance with me. There are lots of good sailing naratives out there so unless your running out of things to read, keep looking!"
3,Just OK,I was a bit disappointed in this book - the stories were a bit mundane - the type any sailor would have. I want to read about things more exciting than the norm!
4,All I thought it would be,This was to replace one I had. Not the same make. It is terrific just as good as my old one if not better. I would recommend it to anyone
5,Great BBQ Fork,After looking online and doing a bit of searching I decided to purchase the Maverick RediFork Pro. It works as advertised giving initial temperature readings in under 3 or 4 seconds. I had a old digital thermometer that would take over a minute so this has been great. Now I no longer loose all the heat from the bbq while waiting for a reading. As a result have had some amazing steaks cooked to perfection.
2,Horrible Thermometer,"I bought this hoping it would give fast & accurate readings. Well it does give fast readings, but it is often wrong (up to 10 degrees). And yes I had the tip copper tip all the way inside the meat so none of it was showing. I have three OTHER digital thermometers - they all read the same. The RediFork is the only one off the mark. The small hand held TruTemp thermometer I have takes too long to reach actual temp. I lose to much heat out my BBQ waiting for it to read. So I thought the RediFork would be the answer. It is not. And there are other things about the RediFork I don't like. The screen is filled with too many symbols. The most important number (the temp) is too small. They should get rid of the symbols and make the Temp number bigger. The handle of the Fork is too big as well. I have already returned the item."
5,"Works well, seems accurate.","I owned this same item in the past for 2 years, but it fell in the pool, and never worked again. I decided to purchased the same thermometer fork, and works as well as my previous one."
1,One of the worst purchases I've made in recent history,"Hard to read, not intuitive to use, not accurate - i.e., worthless. The previous fork I purchased at Dollar General was a better product. Thought I was getting a ""Cadillac"" for this price and I got a junker."
1,Useless-Do Not Waste Your $$$,"The directions are nearly incomprehensible, but once I figured out how to use it, it only worked when it wanted to. Accuracy also a problem."
5,3rd Time's a Charm,"Taylor Digital Fork ThermometerWe have purchased 3 of this same kind of fork. Not because it was defective but because the people using it were defective, US!! The other two times, each one of us - husband and wife put it in the dishwater, that's a NO NO. So this time we're very careful. Really like the fork though."
5,Makes cooking over a BBQ a snap...,"This is a quick reading cooking fork. I just cooked twenty pounds of chicken legs, thighs and breast plus five large roasts and all the meat was cooked to perfection. I could test each one quickly and pull the done ones and leave the others for further cooking. All the meat for a large dinner party was easily cooked.Keep the electronics dry by just wiping off the probe fork with a paper towel and it will be ready for the next BBQ. Good luck and enjoy your food cooked just right."
1,A BBQ Thermometer That's A Bust,"I bought this BBQ thermometer because it appeared to be the best of all those listed. Boy, was I fooled. First, the unit is very sensitive to water. Mine got a little wet once when cleaning it and it has not worked right since. It simply won't display the temperature immediately like it use to do. Then, I discovered that the thermometer ""ate"" AAA batteries like crazy. I mean every weekend I wanted to use it, I had to install two fresh AAA batteries. Somehow it drained the batteries when not in use. Now, the thermometer won't turn on at all. Avoid this piece of junk and buy another brand. It just doesn't hold up to the rigors of BBQing!"
4,Works well,"The temp fork is simple to use and so far working accurately. The screen is a bit hard to read in the evening light so a back light may help in the next revision, but on a sunny day it's fine. I hate buying a nice cut of beef and finding that I've overcooked it on the grille. This fork helps eliminate a lot of that and it can be used for chicken and pork too. Good product."
4,As advertised and then some.,The fork arrived in less time than expected. The rapid read tip is done by the time I get it all the way in.
1,Steak Burning Guaranteed!,"I bought this as a Christmas present for my wife, who could not BBQ a medium rare steak to save her life. Now they are consistently BURNED! Well done every time. We threw it away. DON'T BUY THIS!"
4,Nice quality,"I bought this for my brother for Christmas.I don't live with him, so I haven't used it.It looked like it was good quality."
4,Love the watch and almost everything about it...,"Great watch, big face, easy to read.I should have read the specs more clearly - this watch runs on batteries I found. Because it conserves its battery power, I found there is no way to have the automatic light when you turn your wrist to see what time it is stay on - it does pretty well, though, and stays on for a max of 6 hours each time you set it. Great for low light conditions.The watch would have been perfect if it was solar powered - and I'm sure there is one very much like this that is - and in retrospect, it's not a super big deal. Everything else about the watch I love - compass, barometric pressure, altimiter, etc..Great feel, titanium is wonderful and does not irritate my skin like stainless or other kinds of watch bands do. Great look also - it just gets better and better it seems - always something about the look that I enjoy more each day.Recommended!"
1,TOO BIG!!,THIS WATCH IS RIDICULOUSLY BIG. I COULDN'T EVEN GET MY SLEEVE OVER IT. THE TEMP FEATURE IS PRACTICALLY USELESS. PASS ON THIS ONE. RETURNED ITEM.
4,The Fall for all.,"This is the second book I've read by Alonzo Gaskill. I find his writing style easy to read and rich in information. The Savior & the Serpent is about the fall of Adam and Eve and attempts to decipher the difference between the literal and symbolic happenings. He covers the whole story pulling from all known accounts and expertly cross referencing whilst highlighting the important parts and mentioning things I'd never thought of before. It is very well researched and Mr. Gaskill is quick to point out the differences between LDS doctrine and opinion (although the opinions are all backed up by impressive sources). Why only 4 stars? There are a few topics that could have been laid out a little more clearly but having said that, I truly learned so much about myself; about how the fall is really a metaphor about our own lives. Well done."
5,self eater's best friend,"These bibs are the best. Its winter and my little guy is starting to feed himself. Of course, he gets his sleeves in whatever is on the highchair tray. These bibs save his sleeves, are lightweight so they don't make him hot and wash and dry in a snap with a little Dawn. They'd go in the wash machine easily too but since they clean so easy at the sink, I've only bothered once."
2,Not Quite Right,"I bought this for my 11 month old son, who is about 30lbs. The neck was too big so food goes inside the bib and the arms were too short, so in general not a great buy for me."
3,WAS great at first......,"These were really cute, but for the price of only 2 bibs plus shipping I expected it to be flawless. The first problem was that the cuffs suffocated my sons arms, so I HAD to snip them to make them loosen up on his little wrists. It did work really well until we washed it, according to the package. I noticed it was even more thinner feeling then before, then liquids would just seep right through the bib getting my son's clothing soaked. Such a disappointment of almost $20 for bibs, it was too good to be true."
2,Poorly fitted Baby bib,"The idea of this bib is great, but the fit doesn't work. It bunches up in front, and gets in the way when my daughter is trying to eat. It is also too easy for her to remove by herself. The velcro at the back of the neck is too weak. A snap would be much better.I like the fact that the sleeves of her clothes would be protected from food.Material is easy to clean. Colors delivered were different than shown, and I didn't feel that this was a BOY product. If the fit were better, I'd rate much higher."
2,Defective Bibs,"I purchased these bibs because I wanted coverall bibs. I received different color bibs than the ones shown. And, the catchall part of the bibs were sewn inside making them useless unless you turned the bib inside out."
1,Dissatisfied,The bibs were very thin and poor quality. Looked like a couple times in the washing machine and they'd be in shreds.
3,Not what I expected,I was expecting to view (in color) the steps til the finished product. The only color of finished designs are on the cover and back cover.
4,Nice party album with only a few weak tracks,"You won't find challenging lyrics or deep insightful thoughts on this mostly danceable CD. The uptempo beats and shimmering, lush, synth-forward, non-threatening party vibes would play perfectly out on the veranda next to the swimming pool while sipping during cocktail hour...or with some wise track deletions, out on the sweaty dance floor. Lead vocalist DeAnna has a lovely voice. What kind of style is this: Some tracks sound like Madonna channeled them on her ""Confessions"" CD."
2,You get what you pay for.,"This item was very inexpensive, and the quality goes along with the price. This is a cheap nose trimmer, which at first would not work; after fiddling with it, it gets the job done, but am curious to find out how long it lasts. Next time I will pay more for better quality."
3,Cheap but Worked for 2 Years,"It's pretty cheap. The cover does not stay put. However it worked for 2 years. I would not buy it again, as there are better models available."
1,diappointed,"This product just isn't what it should be, it will not allow a larger curling iron barrel to go in the slots. The postage cost me me than the holder, so I trashed it."
2,Alright,"For the price, I guess it is worth it, not convenient for flat irons...curling irons only a certain size fit, and not all blow dryers, fit..."
3,New Friends,"Making friends in school can be hard, especially if you are shy. But when you have made a special friend, one whom you share everything with, it is especially hard to say goodbye. This book is about two friends who are parted by one moving away. They grieve for one another for a while until they make new friends. These new friends never take the place of their old buddies, but fill a void. The old friends keep in touch through letters, telling each other of their new found friends. This is a great book to read to children who are timid about beginning new friendships, moving or starting a new school."
2,Doctor Claudius,"it was not my kind of story, but then we must all be different....I found that the story flitted from here to there and I soon lost interest"
2,Not what I had hoped for at all...,"I was quite disappointed with this book... don't get me wrong, I expected the story to follow along with the Old Testament story, but this was just a vague story, it didn't have much substance at all, and it just abruptly ended... I felt there should have been more of an ending... and if you are like me, and want Biblical retellings to be as biblically accurate as possible, you would have wanted it to be known that the ark was not built from oak, pine, and fruit trees... IT WAS GOPHER WOOD... I may be extreme, but it is the Bible being commented on you know... the only thing I will say for this book is that the artwork is cute... simple, but cute..."
2,Where is the music?,"The performances in this CD are honestly quite below what I was expecting, as well as the flutistic qualities of the performer and as the recording quality. I suggest, if anybody is interested in Ph. Gaubert's work, Vieri Bottazzini's recording of all 3 piano sonatas. Definitely another world!"
2,Where's the lightness?,"Definately a great deal of nice, flutistic work here, but I miss the lightness of this music! To me, French style is a funny mix of passion and ""nonchalance"". The Widor sounds way too heavy to me! I could have accepted the tempi if the character was right, but like this the music suffers from overweight."
4,Excellent writting and fantastic research,"One of the best works I've ever read about Jesus and His time. The author lacks a clear understanding of the the first christian generation and the relationship between the Founder ant His Church. Otherwise, an excellent book."
5,Sin duda la mejor historia que he leido,"su historia no merece 5 entrellas, sino mas.lo felicito por darnos esa luz, sus libros de la serie de los caballos de trolla llenan todas las ambiciones que uno tiene como lector, felicidades otra vez y por favor envienos cuanto antes el #6"
5,"¡¡¡POR JESUCRISTO, PUBLIQUE EL TOMO 6!!!","Gracias de corazón por haber publicado este maravilloso libro, sinceramente cambió mi vida y mi amor por JESUS se intensificó. Desde pequeña me ha interesado mucho la vida de JESUS, y siempre he pensado que la Iglesia muestra otra cara de este hombre Maravilloso. Señor Benítez, no espere mas y publique el sexto tomo que debe ser tan Fantástico como los otro y que Dios lo bendiga. ¡¡¡¡¡A N I M O!!!!!!!!"
3,Where is my Case??,"My order status gives an estimated shipping date as 03/09/2005 and an estimated delivery date as 03/16/2005. Well and its still not shipped let alone be delivered to me. Whats happening Amazon? Really bad delivery schedule, I am disappointed. Think I will cancel the order."
4,I got what I paid for,"My price after rebate is about $5. The outer case appears to be solid enough. The zipper is a piece of trash, but for $5 I can live with that. I ordered free shipping; order placed September 4 and arrived September 8. Amazon projected delivery was September 20."
3,"Great price, but...","I ordered this case on March 7th for the price of 24.99 with a 20.00 MIR. A week prior it was 29.99 with the rebate when I placed the original order and fortunately it was backordered and was I able to cancel. It showed a ship date of May 17 and I was ok with that for 5 bucks, but it showed up today. I am happy with Amazon and they will continue to be my first choice in all events. For 5 bucks, I am very happy with it, but the sleeves are thin and very cheap. The Body Glove (Fellowes) I got from CC has much thicker and better designed sleeves. This did cost much more, but worth it in my opinion."
2,Only worth purchasing if you find it really cheap,"Althought the exterior is sturdy, the zipper is really cheap and I anticipate it breaking soon. The CD holders are pretty flimsy as well; I haven't had any break, but then again, I've only had it for a short time. Another con is the chemical smell that it comes adorned with; I didn't find it as potent as some other users, but it is definitely strong enough to be annoying."
4,"The price is great, well made, but has a few problems","This case is quite well-made, and very solid. As others have stated it has a very chemical smell, but that went away after a few days. It is a little hard to keep open to a specific page, since it has a tendency to snap shut, so it is a little hard to work with. And the pages are non-removable, so if you wanted to move some of the disks around, you'd have to pull them out from one area and move them into the other instead of say, moving one of the pages around in the book. But for the price, it's a great case."
2,"Large capacity for cheap, but it smells bad.","Pros: This case holds a lot of CDs for a great price. The outer material is substantial and protects the CDs/DVDs well. The inner CD holders are sufficient, but flimsy compared to other cases I've had such as those from Case Logic.Cons: The most serious flaw of this case is, unexpectedly, the smell. The plastic reeks like an organic chemistry laboratory. Even after a week out of its original packaging, the case gave the room an unpleasant odor. I shudder to think about the smell / working conditions of the factory in which these cases are made."
2,zipper sucks,"The zipper broke on mine after about a month. You would also think that if they are going to make a dvd case that holds 320 discs that they would make it strong enough for the inside part to not fall out. It is two pieces that fit together as one--the cover and the pages/sleeves. The piece that holds the dvd's has slips that slide into the front and rear covers of the outer case. Once you get the thing full of dvd's, if you pick it up without being zipped up, the whole inside part will fall out. This really sucks for me because my zipper broke."
1,Poor quality shows you get what you pay for....,"While I bought this item because of the capacity of CDs it was advertised to hold, I quickly realized it is not durable enough to handle a full load. The zipper immediately broke upon first use, and the CD sleaves pulled out of the outer cover due to their weight. Despite its advertised capacity, this product should not be counted on to hold this many CDs and perform as expected."
1,No Cash Back On This Product!,"Please don't expect to get the cash back from this purchase as promised! To date, I've been denied twice. The second time they said the U P C number was invalid. Only, it's the original U P C barcode! I was meticulous filing the paperwork, yet they state, ""All required products were not submitted."" Meanwhile, I have phoned AMAZ0N to lodge a formal complaint.The product itself is average. I've used better and worse. That said, it's definitely not worth the full asking price."
3,Broke almost instantly,"I put all of my CD's in it (about 260) and the zipper broke the first time I tried to zip it up...to say the least, that wasn't advertised..."
2,"Cheap case, zipper broke, what's the point?","I've had this case for a few months now. One day the zipper began working improperly, and suddenly broke off. What's the point of having a briefcase-like cd holder when all the cds can easily fall out now?(...)"
2,Nice case but the zipper broke.,"Nice case for a good price, but I guess you get what you pay for. Within a week of having the case the zipper broke rendering it useless. I now use the case without the outer shell."
4,Xtreme TB320DKO 320-Disc CD/DVD Case,Hold all 320 disc. No to tight that it is hard to get out but also holds them securly.
4,Great Buy!,They are excellent. Holds all my CD's and saves a ton of space. Excellent price as well with the $20 rebate on each one!
1,"Poor delivery...,",I placed my order on March 4rd and it is not yet shipped.Bad service Amazon!! Very Bad!!I am very Disappointed!!
2,Good product if under $9,"This thing is extremely bulky. It doesn't have room for you to add more sheets in, ie: not a three ring binder fashion. I wouldn't buy it again unless it's less than $10---better yet, $5."
3,CD Sheets Are Not REMOVABLE,"There is a smell but that wasn't my problem with it. the sheets that hold the cds, atleast in mine, are not removable. i was surprised to find no one wrote that about it before. just got it so i don't know what else is wrong with it yet."
3,"good usage, quality could be better","This item was really appealing because of the pricing ($9.99), and the item was working great for 2 days - until the zipper broke. I'm still using it, and it's great for storage, but the zipper was cheap and can't be fixed."
1,lot of space but Smells horrible,"It is bulky and smells horrible even from a distance.It holds lot of cds for just $7.99, so just good for storing all your old cds."
4,"Good product, good price.",This product has a large capacity and a decent price and it dirt cheap with the rebate I got. It is manufactured pretty well although I wish there was a little more room in the slips. Do not hesitate if you will get the rebate!
1,You get what you pay for!,Zipper broke after 5 days of light usage. Piece of junk! It was made from a thin piece of metal -- my pants zipper is lots stronger than this!!
2,Not that durrable.,After only one month the zipper came undone making it impossible to close. The size and handle was what I was looking for but the zipper breaking so soon was a huge let down.
1,bad buy,I hate this item. Looks cheap and the cover coming off after some time use. Don't waste your money!
2,zipper broke,"I have the same problems most people are having. First, it smells bad, but that's ok. You won't notice it unless you don't have anything else to do than sniff your cd case all day. The zipper though, is a problem. This thing is supposed to hold 320, but realistically, if you put in more than 150 or so, your zipper will break. it's just not strong enough to hold all that stuff together."
2,"Works well, but zipper breaks easily","I bought two of these when they were on sale on Amazon and I have to say I was happy for awhile. Unfortunately, the case hasn't been tested well, because the zipper is DEFINITELY not strong enough.It broke once and I had to exchange it for a new one. Then the new one broke also. This doesn't happen if you don't have many discs... say 100. But once you get to the 150 mark, you can feel the strain on the zipper everytime you open or close it, and what's the point of buying a 320 case if you only fill it to 150?The case holds the DVD well enough, as long as you don't need to close it."
1,Don't buy it,"The only reason I bought this was because it had a $20 rebate (which I have yet to receive). The zipper is a pain. Half the time it doesn't zip up, you have to inspect the zipper to make sure it's zipping properly. I would not recommend this to anyone, it is just a piece of junk."
1,I never received the rebate from this company.,"I never received the rebate from this company.The forms were sent, UPC was not included in the pckge, and no answer to any inquiries. Phone is disconected - how convenient - and have yet to receive any kind of response. the case itself is fine, but the whole reason i bought it was for the rebate. i feel ripped off.STAY AWAY!!"
3,P. U.,"Heed the words of other reviewers here because the only thing extreme about this CD case is the smell. It smells bad. Very, very bad."
4,Good for the price,This was a good deal with the rebate price. It is not incredibly sturdy but it seemed sturdy enough for my purposes (storing computer driver cds etc to use occasionally).
