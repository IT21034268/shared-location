3,Looks nice but.....,This backpack has the right compartment size however the straps are too small for guy my size. I wish I could replace the straps on my ruck but I guess I have too use the ruck for the next few years.
1,garbage and antisemitism all in one,"This book is the last book I ever read by this author. The writing ability is poor, the characters caricatures stemming from a mean spirit. It is vapid and insipid and moronic. This novel has got to be the best example of what pulp fiction is at its worst. The plot is inadequate for cartoon network( this in response to other reviewers calling it cartoonish- please don't insult cartoons by comparing this to a cartoon. Cartoons can be enjoyable.)An utter waste of time."
1,Silly and insulting,"This is one of the worst novels I have picked up in a long time. The action scenes are cartoonish. The characters are unrealistically smart and ridiculously stupid, sometimes on the same page. The author seems to have developed his Middle East perspective in the propoganda office of Yasser Arafat. While most insulting to Jews, Mr. Land appears to be an equal opportunity insulter. Palestinians and Catholics will likewise be displeased in the way Mr. Land portrays them. Mr. Land has a childishly unrealistic view of the current political scene in the Middle East. I am sorry I wasted my time on this silly, poorly written, poorly researched work."
2,Land lite,"First off, let me say that this book didn't really annoy me on any political level. While it didn't seem feasible, I don't read Jon Land novels for feasibility. I read them for their creative plots and wild unremitting action.Alas, this one was lacking in both of those categories.This was the first book I've read involving Ben and Danielle and maybe Land is/was trying to set a new tone with this series. The outcome, though, is a book much less fun to read than, say The Eighth Trumpet, or The Valhalla Testament. Things move much more slowly - with character development in the foreground. I just didn't find the character work that compelling. I could see where things were going and found myself missing the breakneck action of this book's predecessors. It just wasn't that exciting a novel, which is a shame because it was written by one of the most creative thriller writers around."
3,Not very exciting about it,"Overall, it hooks the phone to your belt, but not always secured and for sure your belt will get scrathed very bad. If you have your phone locked, you need to unsnap the cover and enter the password to use the phone; the cover is then hanging out like something is falling off the phone. Though it is not making your phone look prettier, it is not making your phone look any uglier than other pouch. And I don't think it will protect the phone when the phone drops to the ground."
4,Tight and Enerving....,"This is a typically tight energetic Albee play, with action and language in your face. Also, the story keeps one rolling and then that ending. Albee is simply outstanding, again."
2,Who is making you read this?,"Whichever teacher is making you read this, I am sorry. This is a terrbile story and is pretty messed up.Could be fun to do a scene from this play if you are not easily offended, but if you are feint of heart, I appologize."
5,Ultimate Opera Lover's Book,"I knew very little about operas because Herman would never take me to one. I love the music but I wanted to know more about the actual opera and the characters in them. I selected this book because it appears to have all the information one would need to understand and enjoy an opera. It goes so far as to give you the character's vocal ranges and some history on the librettos to boot. This book is timeless, just like me!"
1,Global Treasures Hermitage St Petersburg Russia,"Not impressed with this dvd, admittedly i should of read the discription before i purchased this as the DVD was only 10 Mins. I felt that the filming was poor (something out of the 70s) it mainly focused on artwork, for the money I paid and the shipping it was not worth it, very very disappointed in this DVD and it has put me off purchasing another."
1,Nice but...,The shoe was very nice but runs a bit small. Had to return it and it didn't come in the next size. Very rich looking. Too bad!
4,The Joy of Filming: Guerilla Style!,"Go see the FILM FIRST before you read this...it's a guide to fellow screenwriters as well as an enjoyable journal of guerilla style filmmaking. I just wished it would cover the dates and stories of what happened AFTER the sundance awards. It's covers alot of personal tribulations but not enough on the financial side of making an independent film. A cute little smooth cover but a bit overpriced, i thought."
2,Description not accurate,"The Hoop Teach Ball is good quality and a great idea but I assumed there were two balls....the ad says ""balls"" and is pictured with two balls. The balls are even different colors in the ad. I ordered ""these"" for my ""two"" grand children so I was very disappointed when the package only contained one ball. I had to quickly purchase another basketball...I refused to order another one from this company. This borders on false advertising."
4,Great trip into the past!,Film quality was very good. Video arrived in excellent shape and very quickly. Very enjoyable evening!
5,Cinderella ran away from her fiance seven years ago...,"...minutes before she was to say, ""I do."" But now Annette Trevetti's back. She's no longer poor little Annette. She's grown strong. But is she strong enough to face the man who betrayed her, to face his daughter...the daughter that was conceived with another woman while he was planning a wedding with Annette?There are words that Steve should have said, but after seven years he's not sure if he still has the right to say them. So much water under the bridge, so many things have changed. But there is one thing that remains the same--his feelings for Annette. Could he win her back?Together Annette and Steve find that though they've both changed, their love is strong enough to overcome everything...even their past.Patricia McLinn shines in this story of a love that was meant to be."
5,colour mixing,Color by Betty Edwards: A Course in Mastering the Art of Mixing ColorsVery good book for a beginner and quite useful to the more serious.Arrived within 8 days of placing my order and i used standard delivery. Superb.This book is a natural progression from Drawing On The Right Side Of The Brain by the same author.It's a shame that it's only available in the USA.Lived up to my expectations.
5,Wonderful book,I recommend this book to anyone who wants to study color theory in a comprehensive way.Is a very creative support for the student and professional artist.
5,COLOR,"I have read several books on color. Though others may have been more scholarly, COLOR by Betty Edwards is the most understandable. The exercises in mixing colors that she provides are not only excellent and practical, but are worth doing well and keeping for future reference ."
5,Great Book!,Betty Edwards is clear and concise! A great book for any artist at any level!! She explains who we see color to how to put it together on canvas! Good stuff!!!
3,Watercolorist beware,"While this book covers basic color theory adequately, all the exercises are designed for acrylic painting. There was no information in the description of the book to indicate that ONLY acrylics were being used for the exercises. If there was and I missed it, it wasn't stated clearly enough. As a watercolorist working to master color mixing (not a beginner, however) I must alert people interested in watercolors that this will not be the best book for you. Color theory is based on certain rules true for all painters; however, when you start mixing colors, there's a big difference between acrylics and watercolors. In the end, this book wasn't of much use to me. I'll donate to library."
4,A worthwhile color course,A well thought out book. Color theory is presented accurately however reference to the visual complementary theory would be useful. This is a book where the benefit will only be properly dervived by working through the exercises. This takes time and commitment and it is not a book for the casual reader. On the way some useful color tools are developed. In summary a very unique work that is not perfect but can advance your knowledge and skills significantly.
2,It's not her drawing book,"I've been teaching for 7 years now, and absolutely love and recommend her ""Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain"" to all my beginning drawing students. Unfortunately, her color book is sub par. I don't know if color is just too complicated to explain in the same manner, but you'd be better off with ""Color and Light"" by James Gurney."
3,Color,"""Color"" by Betty Edwards has been an excellent, easy read, introduction to the subject of color and its use in the visual arts. There is a ""light"" introduction to color theory accompanied by an ample beginner's level explanation of how to mix and manipulate color on the pallet. Having just completed the reading, I am very anxious to get to the numerous developmental exercises Ms. Edwards has included in her book."
2,Disappointed,I thought it ironic that the author who's claim to fame is from a book about drawing totally ignored in this book people who do nothing but draw (with colored pencils). There was no work around or options for anyone who does not own or have any interest in owning a brush.
5,BETTY EDWARDS ROCKS!,"Anything written by this woman is amaaaazing!!!!! Loved this book! I have to recommend the others too!!!The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain (BEST GIFT I HAVE EVER RECIEVED!) along with the workbook... and Drawing on the Artist Within.... if you have these books, there is no need for ANY OTHER on drawing instruction!!!! MUST HAVES!"
4,"basic, easy to understand, beginning artists' instruction","I found Betty Edwards book on colors helpful and useful.For me it it unraveled the essential codes of finding/establishing colors harmony in a painting. It represented a the next step after Johannes Ittens 'The elements of color'. I use Bettys methodology to teach color to children/teenagers and amateur students in painting. The exercizes are a good way to explore how colors change when mixing with each other.The chapter on color symbols was too brief for me.The 3 to 4 steps in a painting from painting local color to harmonzing colors in a composition was easy to understand and represents important basic knowledge in painting process.when doing the exercizes it is not essential to have the exact colors that she recommends. it still works.Recommended, beginners level."
5,Color Book by Betty Edwards,Excellent information for an artist or anyone interested in color. A book to refer to over and over to get our pallet correct.
3,Ok,"I still have not done anything with this book, but I hope it is good for someone. I might just sell it myself."
2,very salty!,This plums are very salty. Too much salt makes it impossicle to eat. I didn't enjoy it at all.
4,Even Emily Post would like this book,"Dr. McCullough's lively writing style is a pleasure to read. He approaches ""the Respect We Owe One Another"" by looking at the underlying reasons we should value others in the way we treat them. His personal accounts and well-chosen illustrations are both captivating and germain. You'll find yourself looking for ways to apply his advice while simultaneously laughing as you reflect back on his humorous text."
2,Buy The Other Lightning CD,"I bought this album from Amazon a few years ago. I can't recommend it, now that the other Lightning album is available. This album sounds more like a demo, than a polished record.I highly recommend the other one. A classic 70's rock band."
4,Expect the golf ball chocolates to be small,"The chocolates were a great idea for a golf league banquet grab gift, however, they were a little smaller than I had imagined. They are not golf ball size at all, but much smaller, like marble sized. They still made great grab gifts though."
4,Fun adventure,This movie was light and entertaining. The scenery was lovely and the acting was good. Lambert Wilson the love interest for Brooke Shields is gorgeous and someone I wouldn't mind being caught in Saudi Arabia with.
5,Sahara,"I watched Sahara with Brook Shields many years ago, and wanted the VHS version of this movie. This movie was one of my favorites. Good Movie.Enjoy!"
3,Blown Away,"This book pulled me in from the minute I opened it. I'm not a big reader, so it takes a lot to get me interested and hooked on a book. This one grabbed me right away. I love the stories the author tells, and she writes in a very simple form that's easy to follow. The book takes you on a journey through her life, and what a journey it is! I highly recommend this. A wonderful first book for this author. You go girl!"
3,Solid backup hopper,"Everyone who plays paintball should have one of these kicking around in their gear bag as a backup - they get the job done for most semi markers, but even semis have occasional failures to feed. If everyone should have one, nobody should rely on one."
2,Good backup,"Like some other reviews its good as a backup. It jams, doesn't fit most guns, needs an extra $5 for an eye or whatever that thing is, and and isn't very durable. But it is a good beginner hopper and for those who don't know if they really want to empty their wallet into paintball being unsure if they wanna keep playing the sport. Don't even bother getting if you have an electric gun, gravitys don't feed fast enough."
1,No Good,"I purchased one of these back in November. I put brand new batteries in the correct places, and it would not turn on. I was able to exchange it for a new one. This one did not work at first, but after I shook it in frustration, it actually turned on. However, it only worked twice before refusing to turn on ever again. I recently took it to a battery store and they told me I had purchased good batteries, and even checked them (and said that they still had plenty of power).I will not be purchasing this again."
4,Daughter loved it!,"My Daughter really loves this it is really cute. Much better than the idog in our opinion. Not really loud in the speaker. So adorable, makes faces, blows kisses, flashes hearts and stars. Cool!"
2,Not as good as i-Dog,"This was a cute concept, but my daughter wasn't near as happy with it as I thought she would be. The leaves fall off constantly and it makes too much noise that interferes with what you're listening to. She listens to audiobooks as she falls asleep and this thing makes all kinds of noises during the dialog and she finds it very distracting and annoying. Not much better while listening to music. It now resides in the bottom of her closet and her i-Dog is front and center - she loves that. I should have saved the money on this thing and bought i-Dog a carry bag and sweater set!"
5,"Very entertaining, kids love it!","I got this as a Christmas gift from a friend to companion my new Nano. Its very bright and colorful when lit, it makes many funny sounds that are sporadic like snoring, laughing and greetings. The sound quality is surprisingly good and it is very sturdy, my 3 yr old is constantly knocking it over trying to play with the bouncing petals and it's held up well. It is a little top heavy so it sometimes knocks over easily but like I said it is sturdy so its not a big deal. Only real downside is that the cord it comes with is awful short so I am looking for a longer one, they are pretty easy to find. Overall lotsa fun and worth the price!"
3,Overall,"Overall, this was a fun product. I wasn't expecting it to be STUCK in the box display the whole time. I thought it would come out of the box and sit as a free standing product. Guess that's what I get for thinking. It is a good product yes, just the display of it wasn't overall good in my opinion."
1,So small my chihuahuas couldn't fit inside!,This tent is simply for looks and not for actual use. My toddler could have worn it as a hat! I don't even know why this product exists. It is TINY!!!
1,DO NOT BUY REALLY SMALL,IT'S WAY TOO SMALL. NOWHERE DOES IT SPECIFY THE ACTUAL SIZE OF IT. COMPARED TO THE OTHER BAZOONGI HOUSES THIS ONE'S QUITE PATHETIC. I'D RATHER USE IT AS A CAT HOUSE
5,Great breaks and track producing,"If you're into breaks and some original tracks, this CD has it. Track 07 - Pulse 007 Edit has a great combo of melody and breaks while Track 10 - Acid Breaks is self-titled. Track 03 - BreakDown has some good skratching... dunno if it's actually the artists doing it, but it sounds good anyways. These tracks have a good balance of some acid flavor, melodic tones, and hard beats.Also if you like rumbling bass this CD will give your sub a work out."
5,"Godin right ""on-line"" when giving insight for Entrepenuers","Seth Godin has time and time again delivered properous and productive information to the entrepenuer at heart. He walks us step by step into the depths of how to suceed in the dog eat dog world of commerce whether on-line or off, technology or pet rocks. A great book for anyone looking to ""make things happen"" in thier own, soo-to-be, corporation"
3,More music please...,"I liked this movie...however...I was a bit disappointed in the musical numbers and the romance of the two characters. I'd have liked to have seen a bit more. This film claims to put other musicals to shame...but honestly there were barley any musical numbers at all and what they did have seemed incomplete. Here is yet another gay-themed movie that falls short of being great. But considering what ""we"" have out there to see this movie is good enough. And a word to str8 actors in gay-themed films...STOP being afraid of ""the kiss"" if you're truly a good actor you can ""act"" like you're enjoying kissing another dude. The smooches in the movie are completely lame and as in many other movies of this genre it falls short of being real."
2,*facepalm*,"When I saw the videos for ""Were the World Mine"" on Youtube I knew that I HAD to see it. I am hopelessly addicted to musical movies so I was so looking forward to watching/owning this movie... I was disappointed.The movie was... I don't know what adjective to use there that wouldn't be needlessly harsh so... passable. It was also so stereotypical in the portrayal of gay people that I was near offended. Why, when turned to the inclination of preferring the same sex, did everyone begin to dance and sing? I get that it is a musical and therefore dancing and singing but it just became so... ""FABULOUS""!!! Like, ""we're gay now so I'm done playing rugby and I'm going to join musical theatre!"" Why? Were they secretly into musical theater before? Then show that they were! I like my comedy to be FUNNY, not a slap in the face."
1,Not worth it,"Slow pacing, marginal acting, paper-thin story line. Big disappointment. Sure, the musical numbers aren't awful, but I felt like this would have worked much better as a stage play. I was expecting something on the level of ""Get Real"" or ""Beautiful Thing"" and this was neither."
4,Summer dream reality,"A lyric comedy of schoolteacher and her pupils staging a classic Shakespearean drama, of which a plot had been transformed by the participating schoolboy into his daily routine.Itself, this work is a next step of successfully grasping a mainstream cinemaSummer Stormand, most recently, Bruno [Theatrical Release] did."
3,Magic flower creates miracles,"An art major's gay fantasy at school come true! This movie started off as a short called ""FAIRIES"" and the demand helped escalate the present film that you see here. The usual gay cliches for a movie are in place with an added touch of poetry to make it different and workable. There are some nice close-ups of the all male English class when they are playing soccer, in the locker room, and when the miracle happens. The main instigator of the change in events seems so corny and out of place. The rapture between Tim and John is so natural, hot, and heavy. Your grown-up fairy tale has arrived!"
3,Were the World Mine,"Another coming of age but at least this one doesnt have a suicide, a murder,or a baseball bat to the head, just a little emotional bashing. Is coming out a lifelong process that only begins with that first step? I loved the Shakespearean context with a little Midsummer's Night Cream. The Literature teacher is a dear, and the music...made it for me."
3,you'll want to speak in iambic pentameter after watching,"The musical scenes are different from most musicals I seen, but works in a good way. The music is very much like short its based on and all the musical scenes are somewhat addictive to watch with. I love the play Midsummer Night Dream, and it was very fun to see the references to the play and the characters in the movie speak Shakespeare when falling in love and singing. Many will not like this movie cuz its sort of lighthearted with some stereotypical gags (but the film is not offensive). But it is a refreshing to just sit down and see a gay movie where one of the gay characters does not die, or try to kill himself, and the boy gets the boy in the end. The characters do have their issues still; its very interesting to see the main characters mom dealing with homophobia, trying her best to understand and love her son. I thought this was a great mixture of drama and comedy, not too dark and not too silly."
4,Maybe Netflix before you buy,"""Were The World Mine"" was a good movie, but it was obviously a low-budget film judging by the quality of the film and lighting. I really like the story line. I think people should watch this movie, because it touches on the irrational prejudice gay people take on. The ending is pretty predictable and there wasn't as many musical numbers as I expected. A good movie anyway."
3,Pleasant and original Shakespearean gay romance- how novel is that?,"Low budget but well-meaning musical based around the work of William Shakespeare. Although the style initially seems uncertain of itself, this might have been more related to my own anxiety over watching this novel approach to a gay story line. Certainly by half way through the film, I felt won over by the earnest, likeable casts and director's efforts.This is certainly only for people who don't mind their characters bursting into song, and allowing themselves to get caught up in fantasy (inasmuch as the plot revolves around the lead character creating a love potion). If you can't stand musicals- well you're probably not browsing this product anyway!"
5,Outstanding entertainment,"This movie never ceased to both entertain me as well as keep me guessing. The premise is delightful and the ending exactly how I would have written it. Satisfaction is achieved with the results. Good acting for the most part, likable characters, and the lead was exceptional. This is a damn good movie."
4,Imaginative & whimsical feel good movie,I really liked this movie. Even though it was obviously made on a low budget the directors flair and strong cast make up for any failings in that department. The actors do a great job of conveying the macho atmosphere of an all boys school and introducing the themes of a Midsummers Night Dream turns the tables on the bully boys nicely. Great fun and the use of music moves seamlessly into the storyline.
4,"Less of a story, more of an essay","Zeitgeist is an absolutely fascinating book. But let's face it, Sterling doesn't have half as much interest in the plot as he does in making observations of the modern world. This is pop culture, mass consumerism and culture war wrapped up in a brilliant package, but it seems a lot less like a novel than it does a series of modernistic philisophical conversations."
4,Too good to be mere gonzo,"This book has a heart of surrealistic mysticism in the mode of Like Water For Chocolate or One Hundred Years Of Solitude. But the book's brain is almost hyper-realistic in its knowledge of the contemporary world. There are other SF writers, good writers, who dabble in surrealism but no others are so relentlessly informed."
2,Eh.,"Sterling has become a complete pop culture junkie. This isn't a bad thing as he's done some excellent journalism on cultural trends but I have the feeling that his days as a novelist are at an end. I picked up Zeitgeist expecting a novel and got the feeling that he's largely using the main character as a vehicle to make his own observations about media and culture at the turn of the century. It just dosen't hold together as fiction as well. I enjoyed Holy Fire and Distraction a great deal but I think unless he removes himself from his immediate time frame with his fiction, his storylines loose their cohesion.I'm still an avid fan, I just think he should have dropped the pretense of fiction and just wrote an extended essay."
2,Too hip-hype for the room,"Anyone who reviews this book, unfortunately, has to dig into the same kool, kultural well as Sterling does and ends up sounding as badly antedated as this book already is. So here I go shooting myself in the foot.Leggy says the whole G7 deal has to wind up by New Year's Day of Y2K? Well, this book is using cultural references that are already atavisms in year Y2K + 1. Too hip, too noir and too self-aware for the room. I think I saw this (type of) film with John Travolta in it and that one creaked of sweat, effort and dialogue that was just a little too precocious. However I did learn a new word: ""Rhizomatic"". So it's not a complete waste. And it would make a pretty good junk film if the right mind got a hold of it. I think a British director would do it up right.And it's ""Alvin Toffler"" not ""Toppler""."
1,Great music ruined by a bad recording,"I have no way of knowing what sources were used for this CD, all I know is they shouldn't have bothered. Like others, I was psyched to see these albums released on CD. Unfortunately the sound quality of the recording makes this CD unlistenable. Lines far worse than No Second Chance. Think dirty (pun unintended) record recorded through a blanket. There is a new greatest hits that was just released that may be of higher quality. Pick up a used LP and old turntable if you want to hear these songs without cringing. A real let down."
1,"ANOTHER HORRENDOUS ""RE-MASTER"" by Renaissance","This is probably the second best of the CHARLIE albums but once again that notorious label RENAISSANCE has ruined it!This is one sorry mess sonically. This label would be wise to fire all their existing ""techs"" in their so-called studio's and replace them with some people who have a clue.As is, LINES sounds like it was dubbed from an old cassette on a 1975 Montgomery Wards cassette player."
4,CD Sound Quality is BAD!!!! Find The LP.,"Lines is one of the best albums of the 70's. I never heard No Second Chance until I bought this 2-cd set.I like it too.The song LA Dreamer has the Fender Rhodes sound of the seventies nailed.Life So Cruel is great pop.The sonic quality of the original LP was superb.The problem with this cd set is the sound.It is muffled,yet it still has hiss.They didnt use the master tape, they must have had a bad copy.If you have a computer, mixer and a turntable,you have an opportunity to make a much better recording than this yourself.Nonetheless, this is a great CD since most people ditched their far-superior turntables."
4,Great Band Forgotten...,"Any fan of Charlie knows that their debut 'Fantasy Girls' is the definite Charlie cd to own. No Second Chance/Lines are not up to the usual standards, too many sappy ballads and slow songs. Neither disc will win any sonic awards either. Both are in bad need of a proper remastering/remixing. As I recall, 'Lines' spent a lot of time in the cut-out bins, back in the lp days. The band lost direction with Lines and their hard edge and sadly declined from there. Only 'In Pursuit Of Romance' harkened back to the 'old' Charlie days. But without proper distribution, Charlie is not well known."
3,Item not what's labeled on CD listing on Amazon.,"I love the album ""Lines"". This is a fun album and it sounds fine.The problem arises in that it's listed as ""No Second Chance/Lines"". There are no tracks from the ""No Second Chance"" album at all. If you think you are getting both albums on one disc buyer beware.I interviewed the band and saw them on the ""Lines"" tour and they were great. There deserved more exposure than they got. Great harmonies and fun songs throughout the album, although ""Watching T.V."" is a bit dated with references to television shows of yesterday."
2,Prism? or Charlie??,"i own cd's from Prism. I own most all cd's from Charlie. Who is this CD? Prism or Charlie? Why does it list both names, they were 2 different seperate bands. so does anyone know what prism has to do with charlie?"
4,Classic R&R that will never be played on classic R&R radio,"No Second Chance by CHARLIE has been one of my favorite albums since it was released when I was a Senior in High School.A fine example of the golden age of Rock and Roll, When the words meant something, the music was complex, well done, and actually dificult to play.On this particular album, the lead guitar is always kick-ass, the bass and drums are tight and in sync, and the vocals are harmonized very well.The lyrics apply as much today as they did in the mid to late 70's. Johnny Hold Back and No Second Chance are worth the price of the album by themselves. Lovers and Guitar Hero are great bonuses.Like dark beer, CHARLIE is an aquired taste. however, if it were released today, I think it would do very well. No Second Chance can be viewed as an opinion of Gangsta' Rap and the lifestyle that created it.The more things change, the more they stay the same."
4,Great advice - no bull,"If you're looking for unvarnished perspective in how to make a go of flipping real estate - this is the book for you.Mark Weiss does away with the cliches and platitudes often associated with the ""get rich quick"" realtors who shill through paid tv ads and associated books.Weiss offers down to earth advice for those of us who want to know the ins and outs of flipping real estate. Very helpful."
2,NOT Pentax,"VERY disappointed as I thought I would be receiving a Pentax D-L163 battery as depticted, but received a Zeiks rechargable for Olympus and Nikon. Battery says ZE-L142B. Can't find the the price and photo from my original order, but in my account review, when I click on the photo for my purchase it brings me here. I paid $19 including s & h, but ordered from a place called Best Stop Electronics? I EXPECTED a original Pentax for my Optio M30. Not worth returning, but I'm expecting this generic to be very disappointing. I have had my original for 4 years with normal camera use."
2,Too much filler.,"I'm sure there's valuable content here somewhere, but it is dispersed amongst so much filler, I found it too time-consuming and frustrating to seek it by reading or skimming. A typical paragraph read sort of like this: ""[Commerce is the aggregate set of interactions between ""buyers"" and ""sellers"". ""Buyers"" include ""purchasers"", ""acheteurs"", ""cash acquirers"" and ""credit acquirers"". ""Purchasers"" includes the group of individuals and businesses who acquire goods and services for cash. ""Goods"" are objects, and services are performance-related."", etc.] I'm sure the authors put alot of time into this, and I'm grateful to them--this is a subject I really wanted to know about, and I suspect they don't get paid that much for writing books like this. Nevertheless, I wish they had focused on putting 50 tight valuable pages up front."
5,Not Bad!,I not really went through all contents inside the book because I read it somewhere at the book store near my town . Well it really can help much for my E-Commece
5,Great product,"This product helps me feel a little better everyday. It gives me a little more energy and I feel better. Overall, it's a great product at a low price."
5,Want to hear something different? something beautiful?,"I'm sitting here listening to this CD, crying as I type this: that's how beautiful this music is. Right now track #2 is playing, E O Mai - the title track. I have had this CD for 3 or 4 years now, and let me assure you - you won't get tired of it. It's beautiful, and Keali'i's voice is smoother than glass. You'll love it."
5,Hawaiian Music at its best!,"Keali'i is one of the best Hawaiian singers! i listen to this and all his CD's. If you want to understand the spirt of ""Aloha"", you have got to get his CD's. Saw him in concert a few weeks ago. A class act!"
3,Surprise sound,"After almost wearing out our copy of Melelana we bought E O Mai. Unfortuately we're disapointed with this album in comparison. This sounds almost ""folkish"" while Melelana has soul."
5,CD to Buy!,"Take the few (2-3) English songs off, and this would be the BEST hawaian CD, along with his other albums. Highly Recommended!!!"
5,a great guide for dieting!,Through this book I could learn how to diet with no risk at all and also know a lot about how the chemicals in the body work. For me is an excelent guide for dieting.
5,Great Book!,I attended a lecture by Lorna R. Vanderhaeghe and I was compelled to get this book to have more detailed information about why I just don't seem to loose weight no mater what diet I am on. I started reading the book and it was one a-ha after another. There are so many eye opening facts and wonderful suggestions. I started doing them and my body is responding very well. I am so pleased that I went back and ordered 3 more for family and friends.
5,stunning,"this movie popped up on my netflix as a ""suggestion"" and i didn't give it much thought but added it anyway. that was six months ago. i have rented it another two times since and now i'm just going to break down and buy it. i have since seen the other two installments in the revenge trilogy (in backwards order) and this is by far the most thrilling for me. the imagery and soundtrack are stellar and the story is engaging. i'm pretty picky about movies and i'm not easily impressed. this film left more than an impression"
4,"Not ""Oldboy"" class, but still a good film","Despite some fancifull effects and some really terrific and artistic director's shots in some points, this film is probably the weakest link in Park's magnificent trilogy on revenge. It keeps though the viewer's interest throughout, albeit it is not so unpredictable as the two previous films in the series. On the plus side, I may add that revenge is more than justified this time, since the evil doer is a serial killer of small children and the revenge itself is delivered finally in a more ""democratic"" way."
3,"Good movie, not the greatest","I don't want to rehash what has already been said; most of the reviews are dead on. It is a story about revenge, revenge from the female perspective. For me, the first half of the movie was the best; you were given bits and pieces as to what was going on and each new piece of the puzzle wanted you to keep watching. The first part was fun. After that, once you strip the style away, you are really only left with a simple revenge story. The girl gets screwed, she goes after the bad guy. The guy didn't really fight back or flee the country, or drop any surprises on her. That was the disappointing part.With that, Oldboy is still king. To those other reviewers; this movie was good, but I didn't see it as phenomenal."
3,Taking Law in Own Hands,A next psychotically-blood-thirsty movie of a female Korean killer taking law in her hands after serving 13 years for being wrongly accused in a child murdering.
2,Overrated at best...,"I was expecting alot from this movie. After being wowed by Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance and Oldboy, I eagerly anticipated this movie, thinking it would at least begin to hold a candle to the others. Boy was I wrong. This film completely failed to capture or hold my attention. I was certain I was at fault so (unfortunately) I tried watching again - nothing. I want the time I wasted on this cheap cash-in back! I want my life back! The only reason I didn't give it 1 star is because I didn't fall asleep during viewing either time (although I now wish I had). There's enough going on to keep it mildy entertaining (if you're easily entertained, like me) but not enough to make me like the movie in the least bit. I hope the people responsible for making it come to their senses and come out with another Oldboy soon - the fate of Korean cinema may hinge on it."
4,This book opened a new world for me.,"This book opened up a new world of travel and exploration for me. I was vaguely aware there had once been hotels where people visited to ""take the waters"" but didn't know much more than that. With its marvelous old photographs and readable histories this book made the world of spring hotels real for me. I used it as a guide to visit the hotels, some still open, some still standing, and some forgotten ruins, and had a great time doing it. Years later, I'm still so hooked I often plan trips around the location of spring hotels. I've had more fun locating and exploring these old hotels than I can describe. If you have any interest in history, are interested in architecture, or just love exploring mysterious and often forgotten places, this book will be a joy!"
4,Girl Power !?,I was intrigued by the title and was not let down. The book is well written and very suspensful. I was up reading late into the night because I couldn't wait to find out the whole story. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes a up-to-date thriller that comes through with all guns blazing.
4,Great for just about everything...,"Well, the other reviewer should have tried more than wisking. I use my chef wizard just about daily. Works great for cooking anything you would attempt with a spatula, can wisk up eggs, but I use it more like tongs and it works GREAT! My only complaint is the lock that keeps it closed broke, but hasn't kept me from using it. I want at least 2 more!!"
1,Didn't receive the product I ordered.,"I ordered the Chef Wizard from Imcoolgadgets through Amazon.com and received the ""Foodie instead."" I contacted the company and they said, ""the Foodie is the same thing as the Chef Wizard."" However although the items are very similar, I know they arenot the same thing. I specifically ordered the Chef Wizard because my sister has one and my mom wanted one (I ordered it for my mom's bday). I asked the company for a return mailing address label and they said they don't send labels but that I could return the items for a full refund (plus shipping). I sent the items back to them last week. I have not heard anything yet. The refund (if I get it) will help but the bottom line is I didn't get what I ordered and my mom didn't get what she wanted for her birthday. Thanks."
5,A needed kitchen tool,I finally broke my last set after 8 years of service. I could not find these anywhere except Amazon. Great price and quality!
3,so so music,"I enjoy Hawaiian music and this was recommended by a friend. However, it wasn't quite what I wanted and no one is to blame. He's an okay singer."
4,Hula with an R & B spin!,I enjoyed the mix of traditional hula with some songs taking on an R & B spin.
5,10 stars out of 5,"I hunted down this CD after hearing one track from the album (it wasn't easy...I didn't even have a title..). I have since become addicted to his music and have purchased all of his CDs available in the U. S. My advice? Buy them all, you won't be disappointed. Music has a funny way of changing your life a little; this music certainly has that ability."
5,Pop this CD into your car and even traffic won't bother you!,"I listen to this CD in the car--the music surrounds me with pleasure. The title track and the song 'Wanting Memories' never fail to move me. Like your credit card, you won't want to leave home without it!"
4,How about 4.5?,"An excellent album. Keali'i's compositions are beautiful and his covers are better than the originals. A must-have for anyone, whether you're into it for Hawaiian music or not. The only song I'm not crazy about is ""If we hold on together"": It seems a bit thrown together. Otherwise: Buy it!"
3,Hawaiian 'Muzak' for the Masses,"I appreciate the perfect harmonies and near perfect (whatever that is) studio execution of the songs, every song I listened to is a 'watered-down' version of what Hawaiian music really can achieve--in both the traditional and contemporary sense of the label called ""Hawaiian Music"".To all those who like the music of Keali'i Reichel anyway, I would recommend others I think you would LOVE.Israel, Ale`a, Teresa Bright, Hapa, Darlene Ahuna. Genoa Keawe...the list of Hawaiian GREATs goes on, but Keali'i Reichel is not among them."
5,Feel the Spirit of Aloha,"I bought this CD on Maui, listened to it while we were there, brought it home and listened to it and, thanks to the included lyrics, learned the words to all the songs. I don't speak much Hawaiian, but I now can sing some songs in Hawaiian. Keali'i Reichel has a wonderful voice, great talent, a love for Hawaiian traditions and his legacy, and I can feel the Spirit of Aloha as he sings the songs on this CD."
3,OK but not good on detail,"This book is alright and tells a good story, but if you want a book full of detail with photos for modelling I would try something else"
1,Are these guys serious? Is this Real?,"That's what I thought to myself when I first saw this listing. WoW! when the set finally came into my house, I was too ashamed to open it up beyond the second piece. My driver, who was helping unpack the set said..""your toy luggage set?"". The material was cheap, the bags were small and at best the size of pouches, packaging and price? Good."
1,"Nice pictures, not very well written","As a scholar on the subject of tattooed ladies, this book was a big disappointment. The photos of the historical women were nice, but the information provided about them was minimal and undocumented. If you quote a person about something, then you really should mention where the quote came from. The information on the currently working women was better, but again, minimal. I was also disappointed that she didn't include photos of tattoos these artists had done, rather simply included photos of them and the tattoos that they had.Overall, not much content, just some nice pictures."
5,New Author for my collection,"After reading many new books in this market that I have found to be boring and/or repititious, I picked up this title because of the reviews in the front. What A great choice I made!!! This is one of the best books by far that I have read lately, and I am eagerly awaiting the forth-coming volumes. Her characters come alive, to the point that you feel that they are real and that you know them personally, and the story-line was magnificent. This was a hard book to put down!! I will definetly go out and purchase other titles by this author.The Bone Doll's Twin is a book that I will read over and over again, and I rate it up there with my beloved Raymond Feist, (The Magician series), David Eddings (All books regarding Belgarath and Polgara), and Stephen R. Donaldson novels (The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant)!!!!!!!!!"
3,"Slow, but a good read overall","As a whole, I saw this book-to paint a picture-as like a barbell... It's heavy at the beginning, kind of long and mild in the middle, then it gets heavy again at the end. The beginning of the story pulls you in for sure; then, as you get into the story, it just turns into one long story. There are a lot of important elements in the middle of the story that are needed to understand the beginning and the end, so it's kind of justifiable, but I felt that the author needed to pick up the pace in certain instances and leave other things out.Overall, this is a good read. The story and characters do pull you in and, I feel, makes you want to finish the book. There are quite a few books that I could not finish because I just could not get into them; but this one kept me.The ending of the story truly makes me want to read the second novel. I'm really interested to see how things turned out for the main character and the other characters as well."
3,Nothing thrilling but ordinary entertainment,"This book is a good alternative if you are a person that easily get stuck in the TV sofa: Why not read abook instead? This book does not offer any extraordinary reading experience, but you know what you get. The first part of the book is rather prolonged and the other part is predictable. But it is a fantasy novel that deliver the goods: Medieval environs, wizards with (crystal!) sceptres and a haunted keep."
5,"Write faster, Lynn!","This is one of the best ""I picked it up in the grocery store"" books I've ever read. After finishing, I immediately ordered all of Lynn Flewelling's books.As the years go by, I've found that it's become more and more difficult for a book or a movie to scare me. This one did. Not the ""I'm frightened out of my wits and will never be able to sleep"" sort of scare, but more of a delicious chill that sends goosebumps up my spine and leaves me feeling delighted at the same time.One of the nice things about ""The Bone Dolls' Twin"" is that so much of it is told in shades of gray. There is no absolute right or wrong here, and in addition to being entertaining, it's a story to really make you think. I can hardly wait for the third book in the trilogy to be released."
5,Wonderful start to the trilogy!,"Hidden Warrior (Tamir Trilogy, Book 2)I actually found Book 2 (above) of this trilogy at a thrift store, and was halfway in before I realized it wasn't a stand-alone book. However, it was JUST THAT GOOD, that I ordered the first and third books here. The first book is a tale of dark magics to counter dark actions...the king is killing all the females of the line, so they concoct a magic to make her look like a boy until she is old enough to protect herself and take the throne. WHOA. And it is told with sensitivity and depth to the characters...is a trilogy you won't want to put down til it's over, and then you'll feel a little bereft."
5,Lynn just gets better and better,"Wow, this book was awesome. The story is compelling and the characters complex and fascinating. Lynn handles the challenge of writing about a girl who thinks she is boy with amazing style and intelligence. I did not want this book to end, and have been anxiously awaiting ""The Hidden Warrior"" and the continuation of the story. It is one of the most unusual stories that I have read, a great concept, magnificently carried off."
3,Average...,"I didn't like this book all that much. I tried to, I really did, but I just couldn't. It was well written, and had a good flow to it, but I just couldnt accept the plot.(Spoilers ahead- don't read this review if you haven't read the text yet!)I just can't accept the girl hidden in boys clothes until s/he is 13 storyline...even if it's by magic... This device is used in way too many stories. So as soon as I read this plot line I was disinterested...maybe it was just me...This is a big pet peeve of mine... (I know - people are screaming - she looks like a boy because of Magic) - Well, i also cant stand books where Magic is the answer to everything!(Frankly I bought it cause George .R.R. Martin strongly endorsed it on the cover)Skip this one unless you are a huge fan of the ""hidden princess"" dressed as a little boy plot device...... Otherwise, go read the princess bride again - it's a much nicer tale."
4,Fantastic!,"I could not put this book down. It was darker than I usually read, but already I am anxious for the next installation in the series. What I liked most about it were the characters, and how even the ""good"" ones had done terrible things and had to try to justify their actions. Will their world benefit from the cost they had to pay?"
3,I really wanted to like it more then I actually did.,"Granted, it's a bit of a different twist on how the girl is hidden as a boy. It's done in such a way the girl doesn't even know she's a girl. Definetly kept me reading, but for some reason, i just couldnt get into it very much. A bit slow, and Tobin wasn't very likable, which is understandable considering. I really wish ther was more about some of the minor charcters. I did like Tobin's relatiinship with Ki, his squire. It's dark and moody, so if yopu like the darker side of fantasy, this is for you."
2,Glorified Prologue,"Like other's before me, I was left disappointed by Bone Doll's Twin. I've never read anything by Flewelling, but she came highly recommended and I picked this book off Paperback Swap (I didn't read any reviews first). I thought the plot sounded very interesting, what with Tobin having to hide out as a boy until she could take over the kingdom, and her disguise coming from her dead brother and all. However, the pace was agonizingly slow and I felt that this book was basically a study in character development. Very little action happened, until the end, at which point I was left at a rather large cliffhanger. Unfortunately, the pace of the book, and the fact that I was bored the entire time I was reading, has killed my desire to read the rest of the trilogy."
5,"Hot Book, a Must Read for those who like a twist of fates","This book is one of the best books I've ever read! I picked it up in the Hawley-Cooke bookstore and had to have it!!!! I loved it! I'm still waiting for the next book. If I didn't love books so much, I would have just skipped over it. If you can live through the first few chapters, it's an awesome book. If I'd had the choice, I'd've given it a 10/10! YOU MUST READ IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Exceedingly well crafted fantasy novel,"Although it was the premise which originally intrigued me, it was the writing which truly enchanted. The central characters are human, with believable hopes, doubts, fears, and dreams. Flewelling draws you in with their realistic responses to difficult situations, enticing you to empathize. I very much enjoyed the novel, and look forward to reading the next two in the series. My only complaint was that the ending seemed somewhat rushed, and the mass market paperback edition did not indicate that the novel was the first within a trilogy.(I had bought the novel offline) Now that I know it is part of a trilogy, the style of ending makes more sense, and is far more acceptable."
4,Bone dolls twin,"I should have read this book first, I was spoiled by the richness of scenery & characters in the nightrunner series. I was hoping for a bit more magic. It did set the scene for the nightrunner series, and I will have to read the rest of the Tamir trilogy to give a final review."
5,Great!,"I always watch good movies and read great books, and think about actually posting reviews on here. But, I find myself being lazy and not taking the effort. But, I've acted on this.I bought the series (after reading the first two novels in the Nightrunner series) and once I started I just couldn't put it down. The book is filled with great characters, the story is just how I like it with some dark to it, and it has an interesting premise with Tobin really being a girl, just trapped in a boys body.I could go on and give a more thorough review, but sometimes that's hard for me without giving details about what happens. All I have to say is pick these books up and you will not be disappointed. Lynn Flewelling has become one of my favorite authors."
1,"How to slog through mud, AkA where's the beef?","I wish that I had more positive things to say. It takes the main character too long to do anything. If you had gotten rid of all of the moaning and groaning over growing up and gotten to the meat of the matter I would have enjoyed the book more. I enjoy female protagonists usually but this book drags. All you hear over and over is that the child's mother went insane, the father boo-hoos over it and the child is left to deal with the angry twin. Where is the action, where is the magic, who cares about the supporting characters especially if they don't seem to do more than hide, smell bad, and talk rather badly? I wouldn't recommend this book, in fact if you cut out the growing up verbiage of the child I bet you could get the entire trilogy in one book."
2,These characters ... are lacking,"I wish I'd read the story summary before I bought this one. I guess I was expecting more of what I'd come to expect from Ms. Flewelling - adventure, wit, charm, character chemistry, caring, however I was treated to more of what seems to be a trend in Fantasy fiction these past few years. Well, at least it wasn't sporting a ghastly cover featuring some well built heroine brandishing a sword. Nope. Instead we have a nice looking, outwardly appearing *guy* - who's actually a *guurrrrl!* :(So I'm a male bonding kinda gal <shrugs>..I prefer to read novels, Fantasy or otherwise, with fun, charming, caring men instead of this cop out. I, too, am hoping that Ms. Flewelling has more adventures of Alec and Seregil in mind for future novels. Now those two are the best fictional characters to come along in many years...in any genre."
2,Third Part of Trilogy Still Not Out,"In general, I enjoyed the book. However, the third book of the trilogy is still not out, after more than 4 years. I would avoid purchasing this book, until it is clear if the trilogy will ever be completed, or if the last book will remain stuck in limbo."
5,Wow,"Gripping, compelling, engrossing...the reviews that were written on the jacket are correct. I found all three books of the Tamir Trilogy to be just that. The Bone Doll's Twin and the two others in the series all deserve 5 stars, in my opinion."
4,This book started slow,"This book started slow, about the time I thought I would give it up the plot got interesting. This book certainly did not miss anything that might be contained in a fantasy. The book had angry ghosts, witches, Sorcerer. I enjoyed the characters they were well rounded and left one wanting to know more about them. By the time I finished The Bone Doll's Twin I had order book two and three from Amazon. I hope they keep me as interested as this book. I could not put this one down."
2,Not useful in the USA,"I was really looking forward to this book because we wanted to give our baby a unique name, with some religeous significance. However, we ended up not using it much because:1) If you live outside India, most of the names are unpronouncable by foreigners2) Boy and girl names are not separated out, which can get pretty painful if you know the baby's gender and still have to go thru 20,000 namesOn a positive note, I can see great benefit if you wish to use it for the following reasons:1) Find the meaning of someone's name2) Live in India and want a unique, meaningful name for your child3) Do not know the baby's gender and therefore don't care that the boy and girl names are mixed together"
4,Named our kid from this book,Interesting to read about the ancient sanskrit language and names and their meanings.Can learn a lot of new words.
3,Great collection of words...but not for baby names,Personally I felt it is hard to find a cute and modern baby name with this book. It has a very good collection of ancient names but they are not convincing enough to use in modern days. I could not shortlist any names for my baby by going through this book....maybe it is just me! I found it much easier to look-up online for simple and modern Hindu names.
2,many names not all good ones,"Some Names are good. Most of them are like Akuti, Isa, and Shabdarashimaheshwara. It is very difficult to find a good name from all of them. I don't know how many would interested to go through all of them. Common name like Nikhil is not listed. The target of book is to find a large number of names as against finding good ones."
1,No way ...doesn't deserve 4 stars,I think the reviewers who gave 4 stars have not seen this book. I was surprised to find many Tamil names listed in this book as Sanskrit names. Obviously the author didn't do a good job! One reviewer has revealed that the author is the daughter-in-law of Mrs Indira Gandhi! So what? How does that make her an expert on names?!
4,Great once I finally got it!,Finally got my issues and i really do enjoy the magazine. Although there isn't much time to sit down and read it there are some great articles!
1,Got first issue the month AFTER published,I guess you get what you pay for on Amazon. I received my December issue on 12/26/11 with the coupons expired. Haven't seen the January issue yet and it's 1/15/2012. Sure is a skimpy mag compared to even 5 years ago. Last time I get it.
1,Have not recieved one issue!,"Today is 8/22/10 I have not received one issue. I went online to their web site but they do not list me as a customer with an account. We have had mail issues here starting in June our Son moved out of our home and in changing his address changed my husband and I's as well. We did not move! The Address Amazon has for me in Waldorf, Md is correct.Our son has been bringing us our mail he has recieved and Womans Day was not recieved.I don't know what the issue is but I paid for the renewal so far I've not recieved anything!"
3,Women's Day,"I always enjoy getting my hands on a real magazine, rather than cyber copies. I was looking forward to a lot more than what came in Women's Day. Current publications seem to be suffering from same issue - advertising. There is hardly anything of substance in them anymore, just page after page of ads. I don't plan to continue my subscription."
2,Dumping their back issues?,"I ordered this magazine early this past spring. I received three issues on the same day--June, July, and August. It was well past June, into the end of July by the time I received the three issues. Yesterday, August 22, I received yet ANOTHER July issue. I realize for the low subscription price, I shouldn't expect too much, or should I? I won't be ordering again. I just don't like reading the same magazine twice, and receiving magazines that are two months old, and have expired coupons in them!"
4,woman's day,"I ordered the magazine on July 26. The order went right through; however, I received old issues for August and September on September 3, and the October issue on Sept 4. I think it was a way to get rid of old stock. I love Woman's Day magazine and have gotten it at home before. The recipes are great as well as the articles."
5,Woman's Day,Good Buy for a 2 yr. subscription for a general Woman's magazineto come to your house. Filled with lots of general topics to interestwomen of all ages.
4,Always liked the articles,Good magazine used to but it at the checkout counter when grocery shopping. Always had good articles in it to read
4,"To many ads, but still worth it",I have always loved Woman's day but the ads are killing this magazine. They still do have some lovely recipes and crafts which make it still a pretty good deal. I have not been getting too many subscriptions since I enjoy picking one up at the grocers counter while waiting for my items to be scanned.
4,woman's day,"The magazine each month is small... but has great recipe and craft ideas, and for the price it lets me have my magazine fix each month :)"
1,Woman's Day - I actually love the magazine...,But I haven't received it yet since ordering it through you a long time ago! I've never seen it take so long to get a subscription started.
1,I haven't gotten it yet.,"I'm still waiting for this item to arrive aT MY HOME. I should have gotten it by now, but can't rate something I don't have."
5,Auto renewal stinks!,"I really enjoy the magazine, but right now my priorities are on being able to pay for my kids school supplies, registration fees, gas for my car etc. The LAST thing I need is a company automatically charging me for another year of something, that I can't afford. A timely reminder to paying subscribers would be the correct & honest way to KEEP customers. Giving customers the Choice of renewing, without the hassle of canceling & writing reviews like this. Here's an awesome idea for your next magazine...How to avoid getting ripped off by automatic renewals!"
3,late,I ordered my subscription in December. I was disappointed to get two issues on 1/3/12---both December and January. Why would I want to read the December issue on January 3? I could get the December issue at the thrift shop for ten cents in January.
1,VERY disappointed,I was under the impression that this subscription came with an e-read option...IT DOES NOT!I wish I hadn't signed up for this as I don't read hard copy mags any longer.
1,DO NOT ORDER,"I ordered this magazine back in July, still have not recieved it and cannot get refunded. DO NOT ORDER this through amazon! BUYER BEWARE!"
1,Woman's Day,Very disapointed -- I obviously was not paying attention when I ordered this... I thought it was digital. I really am not into paper!
4,First month reaction,Seems well thoughtout and am looking forward to the next issueWe found some good recipies to try --always a plus
1,Wrong address,"If would have been nice if it was sent to the right address. It is showing where it should be shipped, but instead it came to me. This is a gift."
3,recipes/ stories/ some gardening,At first I was thrilled with the magazine but now some of the recipes are not to my taste. The magazine does not have substance in the short stories.
4,Moyjer's Day entertains,I would reccomend this Woman's Day to my Mom and sisters. Woman's Day has a variety of subjects that entertain you for hours.
4,Great magazine,This is a great ladies magazine. Stays the same over the years. Good receipes and advice. You can usually find a good deal on the price.
3,Woman's Day running late,"Although I am happy to have received my first issue of Woman's Day in November, I would have preferred it would not have been the October issue and it is November 22 and I am still to get the November issue. It would be nice if they were sent in a timely manner."
4,Need to order two,"Maybe I was just too excited but I thought I would get a pair but in fact only got one. Anyway, it's clear and sturdy. They hold solid to the light. Good purchase - just order two if you have a pair of lights to cover."
1,Hold in too much heat.,"I used standard 55 watt bulbs in my 500s and these caused the lenses to crack from the heat that couldn't escape. Yeah, they protect the lenses from rocks, but what good is that if the lenses crack anyway?"
2,Depends on what you want to use them for ...,"The printing on these is beautiful. The colors are bright and the black border really sets them up nicely. I can see how these would be lovely framed and up on your wall. I'm sure they're also great for various other arts and crafts.However ...I purchased these thinking that they were postcards and I intended to use them as such. Despite the lovely images these do not work well as such. They must be torn from pages in the book. Each page has 4 cards that are attached together by perforations. This leaves two sides of your card with a very unattractive white torn paper ""fluff"" that you're going to need to cut off. Also the weight of the paper is pretty weak. I worried about sending them as regular postcards so ended up putting them in envelopes and sending them like they were regular letters.So if you're looking to use these for crafts or framing, I give it 4 stars! If you're looking to use them as postcards ... try a different product."
2,Perforated Edges,I was disappointed that these postcards have perforated edges. the paper is very light weight. I will not buy these again for Postcrossing.
4,Colors Are Great!,"I like these Tiffany stained-glass post cards. They're great examples from which to work, but I wish there were black and white examples, too, to be used for patterns."
3,"Gorgeous cards, annoying perforated edges","These are absolutely beautiful cards showing the gorgeous Tiffany glass work. There's a little bit of everything in the collection: a few religious stained glass pieces, the classic wisteria and lilac, as well as a fantastic peacock piece. I bought these to use on postcrossing, but unfortunately I had to trim every single card before I could use it, as the perforated edges don't rip cleanly from the book and make the cards look really cheap. Big drawback. After the trim they were perfectly nice looking cards, but having to trim them was annoying."
3,"Nice Images, Poor Card Stock Quality","I purchased these for Postcrossing swaps. The images of the stained glass are quite lovely, but they are on pages with four cards with perforations. Two sides of the card have ugly perforations and two sides are fine. The card stock isn't as heavy or as nice of quality as other postcards."
5,"Rythm, mesmerizing","What makes Poe's poetry so gripping? It is not the words themselves, but rather the rythm and beat they create. His poems are just begging to be read and these cd's do just that. A great piece of work."
4,Harry Bosch is a force to be reckoned with!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Another good job by former LA crime reporter Connelly who always fills his books with great detail, colorful characters, and the nicotine addicted, pistol-packing cop-on-a-major-ego-trip, Det. Harry Bosch. I really liked this book but I thought the court case was unessecary, Connelly is no Grisham or Turow, which is why I buy his books. I really enjoyed ""Trunk Music"", ""Blood Work"" and ""The Poet"". I would reccomend these later three over the old titles just becuase it seems Connelly has finally found his form. ""Blonde"" was a good book, but it did have a few problems."
3,Decent read,"Overall, I enjoyed this book. However, I began to get a little bored with the court room scenes. Thankfully, there was enough relief from that in other scenes that moved the plot forward. I like the author's style, but for some reason, this book didn't grab me. I'm hoping Blood Work is better because it's already on my list of books to read."
4,A rock solid plot that keeps you guessing!,"How do you capitalize on your previous job experience? You write about it!Michael Connelly books have mesmerized readers with his working knowledgeof the California Law Enforcement community. Not even some of his main characters are saved from the evil that lurks there. My thoguht is: If once you delve into his world of characters, and you don't find yourself fully engaged, you might want to check your sanity."
5,Great read,"One of ""Harrys'"" best investigations, with lots of twist and turn and of course, a real pain in the ass police administration."
3,concrete blonde,Concrete blonde is actually a very good read. I have read most of Michael. Conellys. books and to be honest until Milky Haller was introduced i was tired of the moodyand predictable Harry Bosch.However at least this book has more depth and the entwinig of a case and a court trial makes the book a little intriguing . Im still sold on anything that Mickey Haller is involved in but this is definitely one of Conellys readable Bosch stories .
4,A classic Harry Bosch story,"With its many twists and turns, the story keeps your attention right to the end. The personal struggles of Bosch keep the book grounded."
4,Good Mystery,"The Concrete Blonde is my third Harry Bosch's noval and the fifth of Connelly's. After reading the two non-Bosch noval - The Poet & Blookwork - which are both absolutely excellent books, I started reading Harry Bosch series and started from the latest ones (Trunk Music, and The Last Coyote). Both, IMHO, are not so good. The Concrete Blonde, however, is a much better book compare to those two. I wish I had started the series from the earliest ones which sure would have made The Last Coyote that much more interesting to read. (In some ways, The Last Coyote is not exactly a stand-alone noval, which is more like the sequel of The Concrete Blonde). However, I enjoy The Concrete Blonde very much - good plot, good characters development, and as always, good story telling. My advice is that if you haven't started the Harry Bosch's series, don't start like I did."
3,Not as per my expectation,"""The Concrete Blonde"" is my second Michael Connely's book and my first Harry Bosch series book. My first Michael Connely's book was ""The Lincoln Lawyer"". ""The Concrete Blonde"" is good but not as good as ""The Lincoln Lawyer"". The book revolves around a court case filed by a widow whose husband, supposedly the serial killer Dollmaker, was shot by Harry four years back, alleging that Harry killed wrong the person.Based on book's summary, I expected the focus of the book focus would be the serial killer, but the focus of the book turned out to be the court case on Harry. I was not hooked to the book may be because of my different expectation. I will take a temporary break from Connely's book and explore some non-fiction books for a change, but I plan to return and read Connely's books such as ""The Last Coyonte"" and ""The Poet"".Happy reading !!!"
4,Another good Harry Bosch story,Good story which intermingled a personal aspect of Harry Bosch's past and his mother's death with a current murder investigation. Good read and kept me interested throughout.
5,Best Harry Bosch story ever !,Best Bosch story that I have read thus far. There was beef to the plot. Thought the killer was one charactor then another and finally twists into another. Harry given ultimatum by his girlfriend finally starts to open up and be a little vulnerable. The story held my attention to the end.
4,Good book,I always find this writer's stories interesting. They grab you from the beginning and hold your interest. I would recommend this book.
4,Gripping from Page 1,"As always, Connelly's writing interests you from the first sentence and keeps you guessing right up to the end."
5,Concrete Blonde and Harry Bosch.,"One of Mr. Connelly's better efforts. Good plot and delivery, right to the end."
3,"Good plot twists, fast and fun","The Concrete Blonde isn't Shakespeare but as far as what they used to call 'dime store novels' go it is pretty good. The story moves along, the plot takes interesting unexpected twists and the prose usually stays away from the gag reflex. There are occasional lapses but they are minor. A good book for sitting in an airport or on a boring plane."
3,A typical Bosch novel,"A good read....entertaining. This is about par for this series and a bit predictable, but I can't turn away a Connelly book."
3,Sorry but 'The Poet' was Connelly's best work to date...,"After having read 'The Poet' and finding it to be absolutely one of the BEST crime/thrillers I had ever read, I figured that Connelly had also written other great stories as well...so I picked up 'Concrete Blonde' and decided to give it a go. After 200 pages I finally gave up. I can't say as though I thought it was bad, but it was SO different than 'The Poet' (which I LOVED if you couldn't tell) that I was totally disappointed with how this one started out. Maybe my concentration was off that couple days when I tried to read it, I don't know--but the end result is I just couldn't finish it. But I WILL say this: For what little I DID read, I felt was well written, just not nearly as compelling as my 'other' favorite...Sorry to the Harry fans."
4,A keeper,"This is the second book by Michael Connelly that I have read. I think i will read more, now. He gives each of his characters not just a life, but quirks. You often find slite humor in the words. Not luagh out lound humor, but humor as what you and a co-worker would chuckcle at, when your boss comes into the office.As for pacing of the book, excellent. Nothing is a give me. You brain specualtes but you can't go far, the book will not let you.Read it, enjoy it."
4,"The Concrete Blonde, by Michael Connelly","This was an excellent mystery/courtroom drama/thriller; I didn't really expect anything less, because I'm fast learning that Michael Connelly is a sure bet for a fantastic read.In this book, Detective Harry Bosch kills a man he was sure was a monster - a serial killer. Unfortunately, the circumstances surrounding this incident left Harry explaining why he didn't call for back-up, and why he shot and killed an un-armed man. Four years later, this man's wife sues Harry for her husband's wrongful death and he has to justify his actions in court, or accept that he made a horrible mistake.It's probably best to read the whole Harry Bosch series in order; I wish I had."
5,Concrete Blond,"I am a fan of Michael Connelly's works, particularly the Harry Bosch books. This book was another great effort by this talented author, which is why i rated it the highest possible"
5,The concrete blonde,"I enjoy the Harry Bosch novel's so much. Following this detectives life book by book always has me on the edge of my seat. I truly enjoy coming across the other familiar characters along the way as well. Even if you read a couple novel's out of order, Connelly thoroughly explains the people and events so well along the way- it's like you haven't missed a beat anywhere."
3,Ok,It was ok. I think the court scene was too drawn out and could have concentrated on the crimes more.
4,Harry Bosch and his grim world,"Quite an absorbing story. Michael Connelly IS indeed a great writer. His characters are quite edgy. I'd recommend it to anyone who wants to read a gripping, suspenseful story."
1,Totally inadequate!,These lift supports were weaker than the lifts I was trying to replace. They were also dimensionally smaller in the diameter of both the shaft and the barrel. Do not waste your time. The only good part is that Amazon picked them right up and gave me credit.
2,Almost useless,"I bought this book because the Exam Cram on 70-175 was excellent. However, I found this book almost useless. A lot of topics in the exam are not covered at all or enough by this book. You are very likely to fail the exam if you only rely on this book. The practical questions are stupid and too simple, you will be shocked when you do the real questions. To prepare the 70-229 exam, I highly recommend 'Professional SQL SERVER 2000 Programming' by Robert Vieira. That book covers everything you need to pass."
2,not the best one ...,I passed the exam but only because I got rid of this book and studied from MSDN a week before. The book covers most of the topics as if they were in a high school curriculum. I'd say if you are preparing for the MCSE/MCSD/MCP exam then DO NOT go by this book. But is fairly ok if you'd want an introduction to SQL Server 2000 before digging deeper into another detailed exam material.
2,Good for topics - lacking substance,"It's a good study guide in the sense that it tells you what might be on the test - but it doesn't go into detail. A lot of wasted words on the different types of tests.... but when it comes to the actual questions, often it says "" there will be several questions about .... review the technical reference to prepare youself."" Like, HELLO?!?! that's why I bought this book. But it does give you a list of what to know. Definitely not worth the price!"
4,"boats are not seaworthy, the house is","Glen Carig has great promise, but ends up dwelling where it shouldn't, skipping where it should linger, describing in the most technical manner where...... Well, you get it. Hodgson always seem to choose the wrong time to do or not to do something in this novel. sad. the story is about the fate of some ships in a strange place. the house on the borderland is the greatest book in weird fiction. amazing imagery, great description, the helplesness and horror the man in the house is experiencing can be experienced by anyone. the weird landscape and the descriptions of cosmos is a must-read. the story is about a house connected to something outerworldly. it is visited by strange beings trying to get in. the main person must keep them out, and wants to solve the mystery"
4,Good rock n'roll,"Orchetra of wolves is a good music record, despite the nu metal influences. They're(the band)young but succeeded to combine very well the contemporary style of heavy music with the roots of rock."
3,Hmm....,"It's 2009 and I just discovered this album. It's good, really it is! But.....listening to it repeatedly, I keep thinking to myself ""Thursday did this earlier, and better.""These guys are following in the shadow of Thursday's ""Full Collapse"", IMHO. I like them, but I *love* Thursday. I think anyone who honestly compares the two is likely to come to a similar conclusion."
5,A Believing Book,"My review is that I am desperately in search for a copy of this fabulous book and I can't find it anywhere,. . . .. .. . any tips?"
5,The BEST Hot sauce EVER!,"I was SO glad to find this hot sauce on Amazon. I used to buy a ton of these when we drove to Rocky Point Mexico from Phoenix. I haven't been there in a while, so NO Huichol Hot sauce for me until I found it here! It makes everything taste great!"
5,Treat yourself!,A must purchase if you love good flavors. This sauce is unique to a small region in Mexico. I credit Amazon for supplying it! Give it a try...it's very tasty!
5,best movie ever!!!!!!!,"I watched this movie on vacation and it totally blew me away! I mean wow! The animation for this movie is great to start with. The story is also very deep and touching. I was deeply moved. Not only that, but the script is ingeniusly written. There are also great songs that had me and my whole family singing along. If you like good movies, buy this!"
2,"Rather dark, somber, even scary whale movie.","""Samson and Sally"" is a dark film that will worry and disturb more sensitive viewers. All the problems that Samson faces and tries to correct remain unresolved in the end. Our daughter (who is 8 and is obsessed with anything to do with whales) loves this film, but we have been disturbed about the lack of resolution and the total depressivness of this film. It seems like a movie cooked up by Greenpeace, but with an even more somber note."
5,Amazing Tribute,"What an amazing album and tribute to his Grandmother. Being a haole from the mainland, I am ever so grateful for both Hawaiian and English lyrics. I am amazed at the inner peace I gain just listening to the Artists on this album. I love listening to Keali'i sing in English so I can understand the words but I enjoy it so much more when I hear the Hawaiian lyrics. The more I study the stories and lyrics in the booklet that comes with the album the more words I recognize being sung. Just hearing this Hawaiian man lovingingly singing tributes to his Grandmother brings peace and calm to my life as well as fun memories of my own Grand and Great-Grand parents. Thank You."
5,A rear peek into Hawaiian family life and lifestile,On this CD Keali`i Reichels beautiful songs is like still pictures from the family album... glimpses of a traditional Hawaiian lifestyle and how they - the Hawaiians - have a lot to offer the modern world in terms of how to lovingly nurture you and your own family... if you listen closely to the songs... you will get the recipe! Love it! I want to go there!
5,WisSkye,"My husband is addicted. I like them too! They are nutritious, well packaged, and they arrive promptly when we order. They go along on all our expeditions, golfing, canoing, camping, and they make a dandy meal replacement when we are at home, too. Great product."
3,"Taste great, look OK","We use these as ""treat bars"" and they definitely are tasty - sweet but not too sweet, hearty but not too hearty. The only issue is that they come in individual, plain transparent wrappers and the product is not particularly visually appealing. So a design on the wrapper would go a long way towards making it look enticing. Once you get past that, though, they are tasty - I'd give it 4 stars for taste."
5,Vegan Natural Choice,"Vegan. Natural. Very moist and dense. Great fruit flavor with small pieces of nuts. Consistency similar to thick pecan pie filling. Great for trekking, camping, or backpacking. Also great to have on hand as a satisfying anytime vegan treat. Clear ""see your food"" wrapper. High energy density. Compact format. 250 kcal per square. Convenient lightweight recyclable barrel package is like a cookie jar. Have ordered many Betty Lou's products. Very happy every time. Six star company and products. Also really likeBetty Lou's Organic Vegan Bar, Nutty Delight, 1.75-Ounce Bars (Pack of 12)and Betty Lou's Jumbo Fruit Bar, Cherry, 2-Ounce Bars (Pack of 36). This review is out there for those for whom this makes a difference. See all of my reviews for more great choices. Check out ""Vegan Grocery Favorites"" and ""Vegan Grocery Top Ten"" in Listmania. Your ""helpful"" votes count and will be greatly appreciated to benefit the search of others. Thank you."
4,Ain't Bad,"I bought these because I wanted a great tasting vegan bar that could be indulged-in as a dessert. Another reviewer rated these better than Larabars, so I was sold.Sadly, they're not as good as Larabar, but definently hold their own. Nice and moist, healthy, and tons of good stuff for you without the yucky chemicals. I dig 'em. Fairly priced."
4,"D-Noy, Le Beat #4",Really great !Super in car !Watch out to not overspeed!10 tunes out of 19 excellent.The 2 best are track 14 and 18.
1,Incomplete and full of errors,"I found this book to be difficult to follow due to lack of examples and meandering subject matter. The author seems to have problems focusing directly on the topic at hand. What examples do exist have errors, which is enough to confuse any student. The difficulty of the end of chapter problems is a bit tough at points which is confounded by the lack of provided solutions. the book has 0 solutions with a promise that 20% of the problems are solved online. Instead, what is found on line are hand scribbled answers with no explination. This book is a work in progress at best."
1,"Yeah, maybe if I already had a degree...","This book is very tough for someone just starting Electrical Engineering to understand. The book reqires a lot of previous subject matter knowledge that can be very frustrating if you don't have it. The mathematical derivations of the equations are somewhat choppy and skip many steps. Also, the problems at the end of each chapter are extremely difficult compared to what was taught in each chapter."
1,Terrible Book,"This book is full of errors and the subject matter presentation is far from an introduction. I used this in an intro class and it was one of the most useless textbooks I have ever bought. If it is a required book, do yourself a favor and buy some additional reading material."
1,Not very helpful,"I'm using this textbook for an introductory course for electrical engineering and it's done nothing but make things more confusing. Aside from seeming to be disorganized and overly complicated, it also has a massive disconnect between practice problems and examples. The examples and formulas only explain the most basic application of any knowledge gleaned from the text and do nothing to prepare the student for any of the practice problems. If you're looking for a textbook for electrical engineering, it'd probably be easier and cheaper to try and find another."
1,This book Sucks!,Do not buy this book unless u have too...I bought it because i took this course and the professor choose this book...if it wasn't for the homework... I wouldn't buy it.
5,Very Good Book!,Love the details about making the doors and the different designs. Looking forward to putting it to good use and keep as handy reference guide.
2,chocolate tennis balls,"I find everything I need at Amazon so I always look there first. Chocolate tennis balls for a tennis party, perfect! They were the size of malted milk balls. Unfortunately, they arrived 3 days after the party. The caveat here is, not everything from Amazon may arrive at an impressive 2 or 3 days. This shipment took 8 days from the Candy/Cosmetic Depot back east to southern California."
5,Better than expected,"I'm taking a defensive active shooter class this summer where you defend yourself, care for and administer first aid to a wounded bystander all the time trying not to get shot yourself. Part of that class you use Airsoft pistols for obvious reasons. I bought the extra mag for change outs. The performance is astounding."
5,Northern Exposures : Photographs,A great book for a Fan of Northern Exposure. Rob Morrow really captures the behind the scenes activity and personalities of the cast. I loved it!
3,"Not enough pictures, and a little repetitious","This could have been a very special book. The pictures were great and it was interesting to see some of the background work that went on during the filming. I especially enjoyed the photo of John Corbett's dressing room door. However, it seemed to be a rushed job and there weren't enough captions to go with the pictures. I would have appreciated it more if it were longer and more detailed. On the other hand, I know I'll peruse it often!"
3,A must for any true NX fan,"Rob Morrow gave this book his signature which is revealing very little about the people in the series but I guess that is subjective. I was disappointed that there were not hardly any pictures of the cast but a lot of the other crew members, that, sorry, guys, I am not as interested in. It was not worth what I paid."
5,"Rob Morrow took these pictures, so there are none OF him.","This is a book of candid shots of the whole cast, excluding Rob. Some are cute. It was worth the $2.00 I paid in a used book store."
3,O.K.,"The book was enjoyable enough, but I was a little disappointed we didn't see more of the people from the show. Walt for example, Eve, Dave etc. All great faces. I'm sure the background people meant a lot to Rob, but I'd have rather seen all the characters I fell in love with. I still would have bought the book though. Publish another one Rob!"
3,"Lavishly presented and formatted, but is lacking...","One can tell that Nicholas Orme has done extensive research on this book, digging up any and all facts about medieval children, and I applaud him for making the effort for what promised to be interesting subject matter. However, the fact remains that children were NOT extensively documented then, like they are today, and Orme digresses (distractingly often) into the realm of personal conjecture and an almost constant apology for the lack of sources. What I found most irritating was that about half of his sources date from Tudor England, which is better categorized as Renaissance rather than Medieval, and NONE of his sources predate ~AD 1,000. But the illustrations are heavenly, the hardback editon is a joy to handle, and I did learn quite a lot, but overall, the project was rather more ambitious than the material he had to work with."
5,"""Bill never played badly""","Before I bought this cd I knew nothing about bill. What I knew was just his name. I also heard he's a genius. I finally got his cd a few days before. It's so right that he lived for his music and his piano. He guide you to his music world and affect your own. A song create a dream. You dream you float you want more. All the songs are remarkable. Santa Clause is coming to Town was lovely.I love you,Porgy and What kind of fool am I? are so gentle even hiding a little sadness. How sensative! How could he make tunes come into lives. I was reading the liner notes while listening. It's by his close friend--Gene Lees. As I read on I know more about bill. Beforehand I thought Bill's still alive, when I knew that Bill had passed away on 1980 Sep. the tears in my eyes prevented me from reading. He left before I was born. What a pity! He should be remembered by jazz lovers."
5,Poetic perfection,"These albums (solo sessions 1 & 2) are truly not to be missed. The clarity of the ideas Bill Evans expresses on these recordings, with his lyrical melodies that absolutely sing to the listener, spellbinding harmonies and uncanny sense of rhythm are simply beautiful. The Spartacus Love Theme / Nardis and My Favorite Things / Easy to Love / Baubles Bangles and Beads tracks are exceptional. Highly recommended."
3,Good wiper with minor drawbacks,"These wipers work well at all speeds but, as I have found with most of the wiper blades that feature a ""spoiler"" the seem to drag water back across the windshield at highway speeds (65-80mph). The installation is simple. Another drawback is that the passenger side wiper seems to leave a residue line where it stops. This line washes off easily but still its annoying. For the price i would just go back to my rain-x lattitude blades, or try the PIAA equivalent"
3,Does NOT fit a W124 Mercedes E-class,"I've used, and liked, PIAA Super Silicone wipers before on other cars. I was excited to see one listed for my 1994 Mercedes E320. Problem is, this blade does NOT fit the arm on the car. None of the four adapters that ship with the PIAA make it work, and, the adapter from the original Mercedes blade won't work, either. Amazon's listing of this being compatible with the W124 chassis Mercedes (1986-1995 E-class) is incorrect.One must be careful with auto parts compatibility listings on Amazon, for I have found they are often incorrect. In this case, I researched this one using tire rack's website, which also showed it to fit. It does not."
5,A gift for my husband,He collects these magazines. I wanted to keep his collection going and this is a start. I will buy more of these.
1,"Normally good, PrecisionCraft fails this time","I've purchased other PrecisionCraft magnets in the past, including some 25-lb disk magnets that are a class A bearcat to pull off a 1/4' thick steel column. I expected no less of these 100-lb handle magnets. Unfortunately, the two handle magnets I purchased didn't live up to the same standard. One of them is barely magnetic at all, and the other holds less than half the 100-lb weight it should hold. The price is right, so it's worth taking the chance, but buy these with the knowledge that you may get paperweights instead of magnets if you're unlucky."
4,Oxford Take off in German,"It is a very useful tool for anyone learning German, especially if you are starting from scratch, would recommend it."
3,not bad really...,but the Book2.de mp3 files on a free download with the $10.00 book is much better fora person planning to visit or live in Germany for extended times. Book2.de and theyhave the SAME phrases for about 70 diffferent languages into your native language ifyou are lucky. Check it out.
2,Okay if you don't need logic to enjoy your read,"Well constructed characters and a lot of action carry the beginning of this story, but it simply disintegrates at the never-ending end. The willing suspension of disbelief which is essential for the success of a good fiction read becomes more and more difficult as the book progresses. Unexplained details (a character who is described as a ""miracle worker"" is a repeated deus ex machina whom the author inartfully uses to tie up loose plot ends, e.g.), impossible coincidences (an ex-con known to the protagonist just happens - out of the absolute ether - to have the drop dead connection to the bad guy) and unresolved plot lines (what happened to the social worker and the ex-wife? They simply disappeared!) sink this book. Deaver is a talent but it is not evident here. If this was a first novel, it would be tagged with a slew of ""Thanks but no thanks"" letters from any publishers to which it was sent. Too bad."
3,adequate but ultimately disappointing,"I really liked The Coffin Dancer, and was intrigued by the excerpt of this book that appeared in the back. Now, however, I'm glad that I just got The Devil's Teardrop from the library instead of splurging on a bookstore copy. There were too many twists, and they stopped being believable. And I'd like to hear from someone who has some background in psychology. Generally, does a sociopathic _know_ he's a sociopath? I'll still read some of Deaver's earlier books, but I think he's slipped into deadline-driven hack mode."
3,"A little improbable, but keeps your attention","While this book does a great job of keeping you on the edge of your seat and is definitely hard to put down, a few of the plot twists were simply too hard for me to believe. The characters were fairly well developed for a book of this length. There were just far too many things that I was expected to buy into as a result of writer fiat that I found totally unbelievable."
3,Good but...,"While the forensic aspect was fascinating, it took almost three quarters of the book before I could understand the main characters. More background on these characters would have mand me care more about them early in the book.Is the book worth a read? Yes, the plot twist at the end is worth it and by the end, you will care for the hero(s) in the story."
3,The Devil's Teardrop,"Sure wish Mr. Deaver actually READ the Tolkien trilogy before alluding, erroneously, to characters. sigh....."
4,A lot of twists and turns....holds your interest.,"A lot of twists and turns....holds your interest and keeps you turning pages. Many parts are a little too detailed which slows the book down at parts. However, overall an excellent book."
2,Disappointing,"Having just read The Bone Collector and The Coffin Dancer, I was expecting big things from this book which I had asked for from Santa. However, unfortunately I was quite disappointed in his latest effort. The plot was OK, but the focus on the main characters melodramatic thoughts in regards to his children really put me off. As a separated mother myself, I know how it feels to think your access to your children will be taken from you, but his thoughts about it were always far too melodramatic to be true. I did not find this book as absorbing as his previous books, sometimes finding excuses not to read it for long periods. All in all, not bad, but compared to his others, nowhere near as effective. Looking forward to better writing next time. I won't give up on him yet."
5,The Bone Collector,"Fixing to start the Devils Teardrop, I was never a big reader , but since I read the Bone Collector,I have been hooked on Jeffery Deavers,he is one of the most unique and suspenful authors I have read.I wish he would re-print his other books, cause they are hard to find,and would like to read them all, 3 is all i have read so far, and loved everyone of them.A new Jeffery Deavers fan.... Martine Bevel"
4,One of the best suspense books I've read.,This is the first book by Jeffery Deaver I've read. It's a real page turner.
3,"Compared to the Bone Collector, this was merely an okay read","This book was okay, but nothing special. I especially disliked the character's frequent, annoying thoughts of his children - it just rang phoney to me. I guess I just expected more, having read A Maiden's Grave, The Bone Collector and Coffin Dancer, but this book just didn't capture my attention. I didn't keep reading because the story was gripping and exciting, I kept reading because I wanted to make sure that it was going to end the way I thought it would. It did."
2,Terrific? Hardly...,"I really,really enjoy Deaver's Lincoln Rhyme series so I was hoping this would be as good as the rest, I was wrong. This book is poorly written and seems rushed, its way too long and the plot jumps around too much. I hated the Digger character, the scenes describing his progression are flat and uneven. I really enjoyed the characters of Parker Kincaid and Margaret Lukas but besides a few anecdotes, they are never fully fleshed out. I also didn't care for the mystery, its not a good thriller, the action scenes are done well, but their is really no mystery, the FBI always to stumble upon clues and it gets infuriating after a while having to put up with annoying sub-plots. I hope Deaver's next Rhyme novel, ""The Empty Chair"", is better because this book is a stinker."
2,More is less,"I was disappointed by this book. I cut Deaver a lot of slack in the Bone Collector and Coffin Dancer primarily because the plots were well devised. Not so here. While the two leads are interesting characters, the deductions made to catch the killer are ludicrous to the point of undermining the books credibility. Deaver even plagiarises himself by using a fundamental plot twist from Coffin Dancer. In short, a forgetful and cartoon-like read."
2,It's a dud,"Jeffrey Deaver's style of writing is getting old. We've all come to expect his stories to twist and turn until the very last page, and he's become so intent on writing like this that he's abandoned any sense of believability. When the final ""shocker"" came at the end of this novel, I said to myself, Well, I knew that was coming. Okay, so I didn't know exactly what was coming, but the possibilities were very limited. And it was just so fake, like a really bad movie. I recommend his stuff from a few years ago, especially The Maiden's Grave."
4,The first book I've stayed up all night to finish.,"I've read most of Jeffery Deaver's books and enjoyed them all, but this is the first book that I've not been able to put down! Detail, pacing and plot are all perfectly aligned, and the characters were more likeable than characters in some of his other novels."
2,Slow moving until 3/4 of the way through,This is my first Deaver novel though I have read some of his short stories which were much better. This book is very slow moving for the first 1/2 to 3/4 of the book until it picks up near the end. The sections describing forgeries and types of paper to help with forensics evidence were informational but only served to bring this book to a crawl at times. If there were more detail and scenes involving the Digger earlier in the book it would have helped move the story along. Overall a decent novel but I hope Deaver has better works out there. For a better option try out one of J.A. Konrath's 'Jack Daniels' series novels.
4,INTENSE,"_The Devil's Teardrop_ is impossible to put down. Having lived in Washington DC and ridden the Metro often, this thriller had even more impact than it would have otherwise. IT IS A GREAT THRILLER. Of all of the books I've read this summer only _The Triumph and the Glory_ can compare for intensity.The premise is fascinating--a national capital gripped by terror as a lone killer wreaks havoc and makes demands while the hero races against time to prevent even more horrific carnage. If you buy one book this year make it this one, it is fantastic."
1,This was a very disappointing read.,"I'm afraid that Mr. Deaver's latest endeavor left a teardrop in my eye. The great characters were so wasted with his plot that was so full of holes a truck could be driven through with no brakes. Unfortunately, this was the only hardback book I chose to take on vacation - and I also chose to leave it there rather than waste the space to carry it home and pass it on. Try again, Jeffrey!"
3,Not enough Rhymes,"I always enjoy a Deaver read, but sadly I got the book thinking it was a Lincoln Rhymes novel. I got excited when I hit the chapter where he appeared, then sadly he was gone. This book felt like one of those TV shows that try to spin off a new character from a popular one to create a new series.I did enjoy the brawny thinker, but I like the vunerability of Rhymes and his slightly shorter view of the world.OK read, miss Rhymes"
2,Disappointing,"Having read some of the reviews already posted I have to say that none of them reflected my feeling about the book. Though at first it entrigued and enthralled, the story unfolded to what was in the end a run off the mill 'thriller'. At times I found that the attempts to explain the 'science' behind the forensic analysis abit laboured, almost half expecting a flashing caption to appear stating ""Here's the science bit"". This is the first novel by Jeffery Deaver I have read, and despite his great reputation I must say I was left disappointed."
3,Madness in D. C. Transit,"Gilbert Havel, a blackmailer, is the only person who can communicate with Digger, an invisible character with brain damage, which left him a 'half-human killing machine.' Already he'd carried out the massacre in the Dupont Circle Metro tunnel at midnight and had three other explosions to set off if Mayor Gerald Kennedy did not pay the ransom demanded.Digger is an emotionless, robot-like madman who doesn't know not to follow through on the death job his 'handler' arranged. Havel is killed in a freak accident, but Digger is like a skinny ape man on Halloween, only this is New Year's Eve. He is unseen by those he's been programed into 'making ghosts.'It is a tense, suspenseful thriller as they try to discover where he will strike next. Jeffery Deaver has written his major success, THE BONE COLLECTOR, NOCTURE, and THE LESSON OF HER DEATH."
5,Excellent,This modulator was easy to install and works perfectly. It has dramatically improved the sound and clarity of my Sirius radio.
1,Gruesome,This book is absoultely gruesome. Bombs drop and people die. Parvanas father dies. It is sick. Not popular on my list.
3,Interesting but Not Rich in Detail,"While Ellis' story is engaging enough, I question its accessibility to today's youth, namely because I think Ellis does not do a good enough job painting a portrait about what Kabul is like. I recognize that Ellis may be sparing some readers unnecessary horror, but there are certainly places--such as the marketplace where Parvana goes to sell her wares--where Ellis could have infused much richer detail in the sights, sounds, and experiences of the average Afghan. I also think it would have been better to define the unknown terms (chador, nan) and elements of history within the narrative itself, rather than wait until the end of the book, since most young Americans will be unfamiliar with these terms, and the whole notion of Soviet occupation. Still, I am happy to see children's literature about this region springing up, and hope that this book encourages other writers to tell these stories."
2,Did not receive product or explanation why,"I ordered this product and never received an e-mail stating that it was shipped. I had to wait until the estimated delivery period came and went before I could file a claim (approximately 3.5 weeks after I had submitted my order). Within a day of filing the claim, I was notified that I had been refunded. However, it put me in a bad position as I had to rush out to purchase the book from a bookstore at the last moment before school started. When I received the refund notice, there was no explanation of why my order was not filled nor any kind of apology for the inconvenience this caused. I consider this to be poor customer service. I would have rated this vendor with only 1 star; however, because the refund was processed quickly, I rated them with 2. But I will not do business with this vendor again."
3,The Breadwinner,"The Breadwinner by Deborah Ellis is an interesting book relating to current issues in Afganistan. The book centers on the changes in the life of a successful Afghan family under the rule of the Taliban. While not neccesarily well-written, it is nonetheless enjoyable from a current issues standpoint. I would reccommend this book for ages 12+ as it contains some violent content."
4,The bread winner,"Very good book I would recommend reading. Kind of slow and hard to read, but pretty good. Blah blah blah."
2,I Wasn't Impressed,"The story was good and the characters were well defined by dialogue and interaction with each other, but there was almost NO description of anything physical. The book is targeted towards preteen Americans, but the author used terms that would be unfamiliar to that demographic and then failed to define them in context. There was a glossary that I did not discover until ten pages before the end of the book.Further, the dialogue was not always clearly attributed and I sometimes was confused about who had which part in a back and forth conversation. This would be especially difficult for 11-13 year olds, who have less-developed comprehension skills, to know what was going on.There were hardly any descriptions of the environment, clothing, etc. It assumes that this audience knows what Afghanistan in the 90s looks like and feels like, which-- as a work that is meant to be a snapshot of a living experience for children who aren't from that country-- is uneffective."
5,"Powerful, Eye-Opening Story","I read The Breadwinner for a multicultural literature course that I am taking during my graduate program. It was one of those page-turning stories that I didn't want to put down once I started. I was so surprised at what I read. I never really realized what was going on in Afghanistan and how many changes the Taliban made when they came into rule. In many parts of the story, I was disturbed - knowing that these horrific things were really happening and people (especially) women were being treated this way. Although some aspects of the book are hard to wrap your head around, I would highly recommend reading this book. It is a captivating, eye opening story to inform ourselves on how people are currently living and being treated in Afghanistan. I look forward to reading the sequels that Deborah Ellis has written!"
5,Sensitive story,"The Breadwinner is a sensitive and beautifully told account of what life is like from a child's point of view. I feel it should be read with a child under ten to allow him/her to ask questions. I had to read the second book to discover what happens to the young ""hero"" and her family."
4,Good book!,"I thought this book was very well writen. I gave it five stars because it drops of at the end, But soon I figured out their was a sequil!Parvana a, a young afgan girl, lives with her sister,mother, father, younger sister and a very young brother. Her dad is taken away by the taliban army, because he has an education (wierd!). Parvana must earn money for her family, but girls aren't alowed to work, so shes turned into a boy. Buy and read the book for complete detale!Very good!!~Nick"
5,Very good...,"I had to read this book for my English class, but I didn't want to in the beginning. It didn't sound very good from the description. I couldn't have been more wrong! I read it in less than a day, and have read it about 3 times since then. It's soooooo good!!!! The only thing I didn't like was the end, because you want to know what happens. I SOOOOO reccommend Parvana's Journey, which is the sequel. It's better than this!"
5,The BreadWinner,"The BreadWinner is a fantastic book.It is full of adventure.It's about a little girl,named Parvana,who lives in Afghanistan during a time when girls wern't alowed to go outside without a man to work and get money.But one day her father went away to prison wich meant they had no other boy to go out and get the food and milk they needed. One day they needed food so bad they shaved Parvana's hair off so she could look like a boy and could get the food.This was a new experience for Parvana.Every day she would go out and raise money by selling things and reading and writting letters for the people to get money then she would get the food for the family.If you want find out more about this book I think you should read it."
3,St. Ignatius of Loyola,"An enlightening book about St. Ignatius of Loyola... It has an informative introduction and autobiography about his life. The second half of the book is a listing and description of his spiritual exercises.I have heard so much about St. Ignatius from my spiritual director so I was curious about him, his life and spiritual exercises. This book gives a good summary.It is written in an academic and fairly difficult fashion. It is not easy reading, although it is inspirational."
5,"Probably the weirdest, oddest, yet most entertaining animes","The Anime Series FLCL (Fooly Cooly, or as in japan, Furi Kuri) is an very off beat anime created by Gainax, the same people responsable for Neon Genesis Evangelion. This series is basically about a kid who starts growing robots out of his head. no really. although the plot is very odd and sometimes makes no sense, the reactions of the characters, the very odd ball humor (they even have a section where they look like south park characters O_O ), and the BEST SOUNDTRACK (well next to Yoko Kanno stuff :) ) ON ANY ANIME!! The band that does most of the music, the Pillows, is a very awesome band and they should be looked up.this show has great action scenes and you'll love the characters. ^_^ JE NE!!!"
5,Best. Anime. Ever.,"I may be speaking as a fanatic of FLCL, but it's still not far from the truth to say that this anime is record-breaking. It has many elements to draw in a variety of people; action, romance, aliens. The amazing animation is greater than you'll get from any other cut-rate anime, almos movie quality. One warning; don't come looking for a plot, because while it's there, it's merely a formality."
5,Amazing,"This is simply one of the best anime ever. No matter what genre of anime you watch or if you are new to it, you will love FLCL. It has great animation quality and it seamlessly blends many different and new styles.The characters are well developed and intriguing but the plot will leave you saying, ""What!?"" a couple of times. But once you are finished it all comes together.It features the best soundtrack since Cowboy Bebop, which congruent with the visual eye-candy you will be astounded for hours! It is the best production from Gainax since Neon Genesis Evangelion.I don't buy much anime but this one is in my collection."
4,My favorate anime...,"Silly, crazy, exciting. I love FLCL. The story is great, the shows are re-watchable, everything about it is wonderful. My only complaint is that they only manage to put 2 episodes per DVD when they could have easily fit all 6. I'd rather have paid the same price up front for one DVD with the whole series. However, my complain is minor against the fact that this series -needs- to be in every serious anime lover's collection."
5,SWEET ROBOT HEAD POPPY BIZNEZZ,"str8 from the anime gods of Gainax, a wonderfully goofy weird zanny romp with a cute young girl, a boy with robots that start to pop out his head and the crazy-wacked-outguitarmopedgrrl whose just pLan PSYCHO. watch it love it support it"
1,Just weird,"If you want your mind blown, fine, you might enjoy this. But personally, I'd like to know there was some manner of thought behind the ridiculousness. There isn't. This is strictly for the pseudo-intellectual. The notable lack of a a coherant plot is only the beginning. I'm an anime fan. I can take weird. Akira was great. Eva was great. But they were also thoughtful. This isn't."
2,"Nothing to see here folks, move along","Less a ""revolution"" in anime than ""more of the same"". The character designs are fetching, the pallate is nice, but neither is remarkable. The pacing is frantic, like most all silly comedy anime. Characters are thinner than the lines they're drawn with. In typical gainax fashion illinear storytelling, preteen erotica and pretensious psychobabble are par for the course. Comedy? It's not there. Sure there's something slapstick about a boy getting walloped by guitars, but every other joke falls embarassingly flat. Horny older men, a sexually disinterested young male lead, crazy randy chicks, adolescent wish fulfillment... sound like evangelion? Nothing here you havn't already seem in all the Ramnas and Tenchis out there. The hype is a lie. 2 stars for the art, 1 of which is for the vespa."
3,"EXCELLENT, but......","If you are about to click that order button...STOP!!!This is a VERY good series but this is RIDICULOUSLY (sp?) overpriced! I would go to an anime store, such as http://www.anime247.com/ where you can buy the ENTIRE series (all 6 episodes, not just 2 like on these DVDs) for $10.99 plus $6.00 S&H. So...$75 for all 3 dvds...orabout $17?GREAT SERIES, but I wouldn't pay this for them. No way.Correct anything I said which is wrong, but as far as I know, the above is correct.I reccomend this for anyone ages 13+"
3,"Incredible Show, Lousy Package","I'll keep this short and to the point.FLCL is simply one of the most insane, fast paced animes you will ever see, and the more you watch it, the deeper you will realize it goes.The problem with this, however, is that the series is only six episodes long. Each one of these FLCL DVDs contains only TWO episodes, when they could have EASILY put all 6 onto one disc. While the anime itself is absolutely wonderful and a must see, the way they broke it up into 3 seperate disks is an absolute rip off."
2,Failed Crusade is a...failure!,"Cohen is like an old 33rpm record that is stuck and page after page keep making the same premise using the same information--and often the same words--over and over again. Cohen obviously feels that there is some ""crusade"" on the part of America to recreate Russia in the image of the U.S. and that our political and economic interests have totally failed Russia in this endeavor. There is very little discussion or recognition of Russia's long history of economic fraility and culture of corruption--rather Cohen would have us believe that all of Russia's miseries can simply be attributed to America's self-righteous crusade to instill market capitalism and democracy. If only it was so simple. This is a book for the masses--the ignorant masses!"
5,An EXCELLENT source if you want to start a band!,"If you're looking to start a band or already have and want some help, I STRONGLY suggest you read, Start Your Own Band, by Marty Jourard. It has any and all info that you might have been wondering about and will make you plenty more successfull.Marty Jourard writes with experience and knows what he's talking about.

Reading this book will speed up and improve your success by giving you tips on everything from copyrighting to song writing and making you a lot more knowledgable.Thanks for reading this and I hope that you take my advice and enjoy, Start Your Own Band."
3,Coby TF-DVD 7060,"So far we love the DVD player it works great. It plays movies well and the screen looks great. I was a little disappointment when I found out that the DVD dosen't slide in, you have to take the player out of its case to change movies. I was under the impression that it loaded from the side. Also the headphones work well where I live, but if you are in a larger city they can be overpowered by other radio stations. I just returned from DC/NYC and the headphones did not work at all there. They just picked up outside radio stations. Over all, great DVD player for the money."
1,Poor Quality,Purchased this player for the reason that it fit the overhead compartment in our Town and Country. The first one we got broke right away so we returned it and got sent a new one. We had that one for about a year and there were many problems with it. It wouldn't read the DVD's all the time and would give error messages. Also the battery life was very short and usually couldn't make it through a whole movie. It then totally died after about a year and wouldn't play anymore. Would not recommend COBY electronics. They are the cheapest but like anything you get what you pay for and this player was junk. Spend the extra money on something that will last and you will enjoy more when you have it.
1,Coby DVD 7060: Don't Consider One!!!!!,"Bought it. LCD screen has never worked properly. No matter what button you push, including LCD On/OFF, nothing will keep the LCD screen operating for more than 30 seconds. It's not worth the aggravation to return it under warranty (see other reviews).Consider anything but a Coby 7060, including buying nothing!!!"
2,"good DVD player, but...","This is generally good DVD player, but for that money you can find many other players with a lot of other features. Mine wireless headphones were totally unusable since it was picking up some hum noise in a gym where I was using it, so I recomend older version of this player without it!I myself picked up other COBY player TF-DVD7377, and I am happy with it."
3,easy and appealing,the music in this book can easily be played.if you want to make it sound more appealingto the ears you can incorporate your own style.
5,ACTION-PACKED RIDE,This is a great action thriller with john woo style action sequences and good plot twists.
5,The More the Merrier,The first time I saw this movie I thought 'huh?' Too much violence. I now love the movie. I've seen it about 4 times and have enjoyed it better each time. I am now waiting on my own copy which is the mail as we speak. Please see this movie again to really appreciate the storyline and the great characters and the romance.
2,Hong Kong 97 (My Two Cents),"Albert Pyun, whose credits include KICKBOXER 2 and selected films from Ice-T's Filmwerks collection brought this Robert Patrick shooter to life.The action sequences in this film are nicely-done and look almost like a ""poor man's John Woo"" but the story itself goes nowhere and the characters are so tired that unless there is a gun fight going on, it doesn't matter."
1,Yet another tiresome Albert Pyun misfire,Albert Pyun is one of the busiest directors around but why is a major mystery as most of his movies are terrible. This one ranks among the very bottom of the barrel.
1,Bad script and awful predictable performences,"Hong Kong 97 is a boring film filled with endless gun shooting crosses & Double crosses and worst of all the bad acting is so noticable in this film it`s no wonder it never rises high above the b-video genre. None of the actors are good ones when was the last time Robert Patrick had a good role? the man has the capabilty to hold his own but not with cliche ridden mess like film has. The first 12 or so minutes were riverting otherwise it fell quick to stupid and rather absurd dialouge. Albert Pyun the director of grade b films has made a film that`s a carbon copy of action films before it, the location looked nothing like Honk Kong but more like Toronto. Patrick plays Camereon, an assassin for a huge company who kills a chinese general in cold blood and is marked for death by the chinese goverment as well as other assassins. I hate this film with a passion and its a shame the director didn`t have a better more creative script to work with."
2,very disappointed,"I've been playing lead guitar for about 8 years this book didn't help me. It's as if it was transcribed by some kind of computer. Either that or the guy who wrote it was a piano player and has never played lead guitar. The notes are all right, but like so many other tab books out there, a lot of the fast lead parts are in very odd patterns. So you have to learn it according to the book and then learn it again in a way that you can play it. I love this CD but was very disappointed in this book. You're probably better off buying a good set of earphones and listening to an MP3 version of the tracks through Windows Media Player, so that you can slow the song down. That's what do anyways"
2,Kindle version way too expensive,"Decent book, but kindle version is way too expensive. Approx 6x more than being a ""Like New"" hard copy. The book itself is solid, just wish the digital version was more affordable. I would love to have this resource on my Android phone (via kindle app)."
5,Best vise for precise work,"Has may attachments, and all are well made, a bit pricey but worth the money. Try to buy package deals if available, you can always add on as needed."
1,Worthless,"I purchased three each of this item and not a single one of them worked properly. It did not truly convert from 240v down to 110v as advertised. Due it not converting all three converters fried. There is a fuse in the converter and the fuse does not perform its job, because not once did the fuse burn out to keep from frying the whole converter. You get what you pay for!"
1,More and less than I needed,"Beware if your US plugs have ground, this will not work. I didn't realize it when I bought it and now that I am in the UK I cannot plug my MacBook in."
1,received broken un-working bad parts,"i received the item Used, Broken , burnt not working with a smell of firei wana return it because i cant use it"
1,"Junk, utter junk!!","I originally purchased two of these, took forever to arrive in Kuwait via APO AE. By the time I got them I used them twice and they overheated and melted the plastic housing. They would be great if they work but they dont. Unable to send back cause of the crappy return policy. Treat these like the plague."
1,False specifications,"I bought this converter because I was going to France and wanted to charge my cell phone. As soon as I tried to charge it, I realized that the converter, even though it said that it was for Europe, did not work in France. I have since returned this item."
1,Piece of garbage,"Nice idea, and I had a similar device before. But the plug is jammed, cannot plug anything into it. Kind of useless if nothing will plug into it. I cannot believe that there was no quality control to actually try plugging something in... seems like one of the tests a company should be making. Anyways, into the garbage bag."
1,Worked for about a day...,"My wife attempted to use her hair straightener with this product on the 1600 setting and the plug first popped and melted a bit. The straightener got extremely hot so gave up. The next day, she tried again and the fuse blew. Very disappointed."
4,I have read all seven of the Eden books,"Eden and Honor least favorite. The Prince of Eden got me startedI love you Mrs Harris,for such great reading."
4,komputerart.com review - shout along.,"""Brothers Sisters"" is the 3rd full-length release from aptly titled Nova Scotia band. It is an angular affair - discordant guitars that still manages to create catchy melodies and shout-along chorus a la Fugazi. On ""Brothers Sisters"" North of America has strayed from the heavy Pavement influences of records past. It now sounds more like Polvo, Q and not U, and Pretty Girls Make Graves. More math-rock. Steve Albini would have been proud."
2,"Keep those lyrics classified, son","Classified is not a good rapper. He knows it. On a lot of his tracks, he says stuff like ""I never had the skill but they knew I had the heart."" Well, Classified, you're right- you don't have the skill. What this album does have is some really clean production. If he stuck to making beats for good MCs he would make much better tracks. The song ""No mistakes"" is about how he's made mistakes and will probably make more. Ok? Is that it, Class? I'm sorry you smoke everyday and feel guilty, but keep that to yourself and put something good on a beat that nice. I'm giving this 2 stars for the production, which is top-notch at times, but 0 stars for lyrics and delivery. Sorry cannucks."
5,I'd buy this CD in quantity if I had more ears!,"For a guy who doesn't even like rap / hip-hop, after i heard this Cd once I fell inlove with it! Went to HMV to sample the new Cd because my friends said I'd like a song on it, well after 15 minutes in the booth i Had to buy it! I mean you've never heard beats like these! Escpecially struck home with The Maratimes song. (How many rappers do you know that can fit bag-pipes in a song & still sounds great) I Know this song has potential! If it ever gets released on Video it'll top the charts in my opinion. Not to mention the Bassist in highschool behavior! Dam!Anyway best of luck with the album & keep em comein!"
4,A new type of self-help book,"The author refers to this a primer. It is indeed, and I think a very useful one. In this era we are used to praising the logical thinker, and downplaying the creative thinker. Mr Erickson shares his extensive experience in using both sides of his brain, but in this case the ""right"" side of the brain, in order to find innovative and creative answers to business problems and opportunities. I have also found it a valuable tool for the resolution of the everyday occurrences with which we all deal."
3,beware laptop users,"ALMOST Useless for laptops, very bulky. Does NOT plug in to security jack on laptops."
2,ELEMENTARY,"If you have had any experience at all in remodeling or building a new bath, this book is way too elementary. I had hoped to find new and useful information but did not. There was nothing that cannot be found in any well written article on bath design in a monthly magazine on home decorating."
4,!,this isnt youre typical hot cross. this album opts for a more restrained formula for most of the album. the biggest change here is the addition of background singing. while somtimes it comes off as slightly cheesy and almost thursday-esque its almost always tasteful within the context of the song. fans of saetia or screamo in general should definitely pick this disc up.
2,"Dance, dance to the sounds of America's best-dressed fakeout","Their split with Light the Fuse and Run was great (though not as good as the LtFaR side), ""A New Set of Lungs"" had its moments, but this is just...ugh. Fans of the Used and Thursday will love it, and about half of the kids who liked Saetia, but if you're a fan of real hardcore this cd will make your teeth hurt. Too many calculated riffs, too much gloss in the production, and cheesy MTV-style 'emo' backing vocals. Technically, everything's brilliant (except for the vocals; Billy still can't do a decent scream), the musicianship is top-notch. But what's the point if there's no soul?This is the new 'emotional hardcore', I guess: wimpy commercialized dreck that only white-belt hipsters will enjoy. It's about as close to original emo as Saves the Day. Whatever happened to Moss Icon and Antioch Arrow? There's no passion in this music anymore."
5,"Beautiful, bouncy anime","A friend showed me his fansub for Tenshi Ni Narumon, and I instantly fell in love with its pink swirly hearts, wacky characters, and most of all super-hyperactive Noelle. I was so happy when Synch-Point picked up this series. At first it seems real cutesy but I promise, there is substance to this show. The characters are well-established right away, and the fifth episode -- which focuses on Noelle's ""invisible"" older sister -- is quite touching.The music is cheery and bouncy, and the colors and animation are beautiful. I mostly prefer older anime, because the new ones all pretty much look the same to me, but this show definitely stands out and I can't wait for Synch-Point to release the whole series."
1,misleadng!,"The picture showed me a perfume bottle--what I got was a mini rollette & jar of cream.The seller tells me I was supposed to read the description,not assume that what I saw was what I'd get!!!!"
1,Shipping frustration,I ordered one copy of the book...and got two..and charged for two....too much effort to send back so kept.
2,Cute but patronizing,"Many women might find that this book provides a quick and fun pick-me-up. Personally, I am really tired of being told that a bubble bath and rhinestone tiara will make my life better."
1,waste of money,"If ""wear a tiara to the grocery store"" is the type of advice you're looking for- you'll love this."
3,"Engaging at first, but then the flaws ...","This book looked great at first, but then, on closer inspection, the drawings are second-rate, the information is thin, and the inaccuracies mount. Yet, there are no real alternatives that seek to comprehensively catalogue ancient life. I'd still buy it, but my enthusiasm has waned."
4,Puzzled by the harsh criticisms,"It's hard to understand why some reviewers thought this book sucked. Someone complained that in one case a single species was described from a thirty-species family; was a 300-page book on all prehistoric vertebrates expected to list every species of every family? The artwork is in most cases very good; the color patterns given the animals are, if anything, too conservative, when one considers the panorama of color seen in modern life. In my opinion the illustrations of the dinosaurs themselves are some of the best I have seen. No, none has feathers, because at the time of printing this body covering was not yet known for dinosaurs (at any rate, the choice to give dinosaurs feathers is still very much a matter of opinion for most dinosaurs). Some of the amphibians do look like a horrid joke; that is because some of them really did look like a horrid joke. This is an excellent book, and the only reason I can see for the harsh criticism is dislike for Dougal Dixon."
2,chilton manual,"Took over a week to arrive and was disappointing. Listed as over 500 pages,really only about 200. Pictures were poor as well. Would not recommend but not to many options other than professional manual $$$$."
2,Poor detail,So general they might as well expanded it to include Fords and Chryslers. Most schematics are small and blurry. I bought it to troubleshoot a horn. Guess they forgot trucks have a horn. There's a reason why the books are sealed in plastic at the parts stores. If you tried to look something up you would quickly realize they aren't worth anything. Save your maney and shop elsewhere. You'll end up doing that anyway.
5,GM trucks Chilton shop manual,"This chilton's manual upholds the tradition of Chilton manuals with good directions in the care, maintenance and overhaul of specific products."
3,"General Motors Full - Size Trucks, 1988 -98, Repair Manual (Chilton Automotive Book)",This book has good info in it but the print is very very small even the diagrams are way to small and it has no trouble shooting in itTreatrider
4,All the info... and I thought I knew everything,"Have used for a complete rebuild to just tune ups. I always figured that trucks were simple and never really needed a book. Glad I did buy this book any way; some info I found was important in order to do proper computer ""cycles"" and tune ups, besides who ever complained about having too many car/truck manuals?"
2,Never very good...,"No info on replacing a dashboard light, but TONs on how to adjust the wicklacker of the kunootin bi-podicular linkage under the wiznat... But ya' still gotta' have one of these..."
2,"Jack of all trades, master of none","The problem with the guide is that it tries to cover all the different models in one book, but ends up not being specific enough for a given model. I found I have to constantly read between the lines to figure out what actually needs to be done on my 1997 Silverado.I am going to try the Hanes."
5,Great Service Manual for GM C1500!!!,"This has all the info that you need to service your C/K1500 Pickup, Tahoe & Suburban... Includes electrical section that the Hayne's Manual does not."
3,What I was looking for,I needed information to do repairs on my vehicles and it got the job done. The electrical schematics was a little vague.
3,Does the job,"Overall, I'm giving the product 3 stars ('It's OK'); it does the job, plus it's the only objective cover on the market that fits my particular scope.On the downside, it's not very rugged. I'm ordering a replacement, in fact. Seems the hinge came down with 'plastic fatigue' and snapped after 3 years, which, given the price, isn't too bad.IMPORTANT: Check Butler Creek's website for the sizing charts before ordering.51 is the model number, not the diameter in millimeters..."
2,Please build something sturdier!,These scope caps suck but they are the only ones available for NF 56 mm plus they're cheap so it evens out.
1,Don't waste your money!,"While I am a fan of Butler Creek lens caps this particular size has proved worth-less. I have purchased the 51mm size three different times from different vendors, to include amazon, and not one has worked properly. They just don't stay shut."
2,Don't bother,What a disappointment. This book contains very little that specifically relates to nude photography and nothing about glamor. It's a mediocre photo book. Most of the pics aren't even very good. This book doesn't come close to matching the quality of the author's other books I've seen.
3,Was the book modified without modifying the index?,"Shafarevich explains mathematics well, but I find the index for this book extremely frustrating (I bought my copy in the 2005 Springer sale). I'm almost convinced that they forgot to modify the index after making modifications to the first edition."
4,A great shelter for the winter,This is my second Flowerhouse - We purchased a more traditional design about three years ago. I wanted this style originally but frankly the reviews talked me out of it. As my greenhouse was over stocked for past winter I knew I needed something else plus one of my plants is about 8 foot tall and doesn't like being in a 6 foot tall greenhouse. I really like this greenhouse. It is substantial and is 10 feet in the middle. The walls are 6 feet in height. I must caution that this greenhouse cannot be constructed alone like the other flowerhouse units so have a helper. I would also suggest that you build it lying down as the instructions suggest. I tried to assemble it like my other flowerhouse unit and caused my son and I a lot more work than needed.If you are looking for something to get you through the winter months as a temporary unit - Flowerhouse products are a great solution and worth their cost.
4,Great approach to argumentation,I have used this textbook for a while now and have found Verlinden's approach to argumentation to be well grounded in theory and application. Beyond this I also like the simplicity and practical approach the book takes for students. I also like that fact that communication principles are interwoven into the content of the book. My only criticism is that I wish that a more current version was available.
5,Some of the best music you will ever experience,"I'm sure all of the other reviews have already praised this album more than I can here, but all of it put together can't be as much as it deserves. If you were in a situation where you weren't sure where your next meal was coming from, I'd suggest you put aside such concerns and spend your last few dollars on this CD. It would be worth starving over."
5,Best Music!,This music is great! My favorite song on the CD is Blue Sky Grey. (I like the chorus alot!) My entire family loves his music. We have all his CD's (including the ones from when he was on THE GATHERING FIELD band.) Two of my favorite songs are Blue Sky Grey and I'll Rescue You. I've met him... at my house! My mom knew growing up. [...]
4,Works great...,"This gadget is one of the best buys I've made in a while. At first, I was reluctant to make this purchase. Besides, who needs to know what the weather is outside when you can just open the door right? Well, I now use it constantly. If you like to hunt or fish, the moon phase and sun up/down features (add about 30 min onto it for dawn/dusk) are a must. The only gripe I have is there is no backlight, which makes it a little hard to read from over 15 Ft. (I have 20/15 vision, in case you were wondering). Oh well, a little exercise never hurt anybody. BTW my Wife and 8y.o. son are addicted to it as well."
5,Very reliable,"We actually purchased three of these. We gave one as a gift and kept two. We have one at our condo in Michigan and the other one here in our home in Nevada. They are very reliable, fairly easy to use and seem to be completely accurate. We rely on them more than we would have thought. My husband accidently broke the bracket that holds one of the outside units (changing batteries) and I contacted the company and very quickly and inexpensively received two new brackets...one to replace the broken one and a spare. I recommend this unit for knowledgeable people because it does take a few minutes to program with the directions. My 85 year old dad couldn't do it alone, he needed help...that's what I mean by knowledgeable. Although we've had these units for a few years now, I don't remember any shipping problems and they work very well. You have to change batteries occasionally which requires reprogramming the unit (so to speak) but the batteries seem to last a very long time."
5,Great Weather Station,"This was a birthday gift for my husband; it seems guys can never have enough weather gadgets! He likes it a lot, too!"
2,Have no words...,Was difficult to keep my attention focused on this book. I kept having to read the same paragraph over and over...finally gave up. Not what I was expecting or needed.
2,Too simplistic for some victims & it's not for everyone,"This book is an invaluable aid to those who feel forgiveness is their best way to find healing, or for those whose personal beliefs demand this, but it's too simplistic to work for every trauma victim. Some victims find the pressure to forgive their tormentors to be an additional burden, or an addition to their pain, or an insult to their suffering. Therapy must be tailored to the individual and this method just doesn't work for everyone."
1,Crap of a Book!!!,"This Book was sssssssooooooo Disappointing, I thought it would have been a lot more Interesting...Don't waste your money ordering it!"
5,Just the Guide Most of Us Need,"I found this book well-written, thoughful and useful. Enright spends plenty of time describing what forgiveness is (and what it is not) before he leads us through the forgiveness process. I found that his instruction on what forgiveness is was particularly helpful, because so many of us throw the word 'forgiveness' around without really knowing what it means. I can think of about ten people in my life who have stopped growing because of anger at parents, from a divorce, etc. and who could really benefit from this book."
2,I wouldn't get this again,These pads are different than the ones from Meguiars online. It left tiny marksin my paint and the real mequiars did not.
5,Soft buff pad does the trick.,Meguiar's cutting pad does a great job on my car. The pad stays in place on my buffer. Wonderful product.
3,Meh...,I used these on my project car that Im working on restoring. The paint is HEAVILY oxidized and the the swirl marks could put a cobweb to shame.Used this with Meguiars Ultimate compound with average results. I thought the compound wasnt good enough and picked up the Ultra Cut compound and tried it with the same pad. The results were just average.I used the compound with a Wolfgang Polishing pal and small orange cutting pad and it did a much better job than the Meguiars cuting pad.I've gone ahead and ordered LC cutting pads and see how it goes from there.Hope this helps.
4,Great for kids,This is a great way to introduce kids to the stories of the Greek Gods and Goddesses. I remember reading this book as a kid time after time. To this day I am still fascinated by Greek Mythology.
5,Awesome!,This book has been read many times by my 9 year old son and 6 year old daughter. It is the most used book in our home at this time. I bought it to introduce my son to the greek gods and goddesses before he started reading the Percy Jackson books. It did a great job doing that and got him very interested in greek mythology. The illustrations are excellent. It was definately a purchase I would make again and I would highly recommend this book to others.
3,Too short...,"Although my son likes it, I was sort of disappointed. It did not have all the gods as I knew from a little girl. I was hoping for more content."
1,Open product,These candies arrived open in the box and damaged the other item. They put sticky candy all over another Christmas gift and I had to return them during the busy season. A big hassle.
5,Hi-larious!!,I grew up listening to this on cassette tape and had to find it for myself. My younger brothers and I would steal the cassette from our older brother's room so we could listen to it over and over again and cracked up EVERY time even though we basically had the entire album memorized.
3,Raghu,One of the best book in fracture mechanics. Quality of the papers not in par with the price. Picture quality is not to my expectation.
2,Not Graham's best,"The Mistress Wife's blurb on the back of the book says ""Can she be...mistress to her husband? Convinced that Lucca, her billionaire Italian husband, had been having an affair, Vivien Saracino left him-even though she was pregnant. Now Vivien has discovered that Lucca might not be guilty. She's determined to win him back, if only for the sake of their small child. But Lucca is in no mood for a tender reconciliation. He will have his wife again, but on his terms...as his mistress!"" I enjoy Lynne Graham's books very much but this one was depressing and not her best. I recommend any of her other books because she is normally great and look forward to her new book in Feb."
3,Real drama ... but bad argument...,"I really like Graham books, but in this case what I didnt like about the book was that she didnt have any strenght at all...She realize that her husband wasnt guilty of adultery as she thought, and try to reconcile with him, meanwhile he wants to make her pay for leaving him when she thought him guilty.In the end he did sleep with another women still married to his wife. And her character just broke my heart, if there any woman so pathetic as her.. my condolence..Even though I like the end, I would rather have him suffer more for what he made her go through..."
5,Great Music!,I love this CD with so many wonderful great hits! It is a classic for any R&B lover!I wish the music scene was like it was back in the 70's. There are not many who have a voice like this today!
4,Angela Bofill CD,This is an awesome cd....so glad I have. I saw her on Unsung and I knew I had to find these songs. The songs bring back sooooo many memories.
1,Never got this item,"Ordered this item on Oct 9th, finally resolved a ""No-delivery"" dispute with Amazon and they re-credited my account 60 days + after the order was made. Impossible to reach supplier, even though their warehouse is less than 30 miles from my location item never arrived. Supplier actually offered to give me a $20 credit towards a future purchase if I retracted my previous review (which of course I didnt do since I never recieved the merchandise in the first place). This was my single worst internet purchase experience, to Amazon's credit they resolved the dispute once I made a formal claim in a timely manner. THIS WAS AN ENORMOUS WASTE OF TIME AND ENERGY I WOULD NEVER BUY FROM THIS VENDOR AGAIN. SHAME ON YOU!"
5,Historical Jesus,This is a very good book that gives the reader a sense of the culture and times of Jesus.
5,I Had Professor Patterson as a Teacher,"I had professor Patterson as an instructor at Eden Seminary in St. Louis, MO. I was very impressed with this book from the first time I picked it up. The God of Jesus does a superb job of relating the most recent quest for the Historical Jesus done primarily by the Fellows of the Jesus Seminar, to a living breathing theology for church and life. If you enjoyed his book, you should try a semester in class with him. It is a very enjoyable and challenging experience. I especially appreciated that in the book he was consistent in presenting the work of the seminar with full integrity, yet not as absolute. My expereince in modern New Testament Scholarship is that one either author's from the perspective of the Seminar, or they simply offer a traditional critique of its work. This is a must read for people who struggle with classical ideas about who Jesus is and what we know about God from this ancient peasant."
3,Nice Ring,"Nice ring, thought it would be heavyer wieght than it was. Ring arrived on time and packaging was very well done."
2,summary,"Basically this is ""cliff notes"" - just a summary of the book. Read the book, don't bother with the ""discussion guide""."
5,Likew it,I bought this to replace a Blue-point punch that I broke the tip on. This punch is nice because it has a pocket clip and is light weight since the body of it is aluminum. Works very well.
3,Useful for casual reviews and light references,"Starts out with a high-school algebra and trigonometry refresher before covering most of the fundamental college mathematics - check out its Table of Content.This book can be quite useful for quick reviews and _light_ references/look-ups for those with a casual interest.I seriously doubt if this book can be used for learning any of the core areas for the first time. The descriptions are typically terse and the coverage, not too deep.Note: if you're more than half-serious about your math, you will no doubt require separate books on Linear Algebra and Matrices, Differential Equations, and Probability and Statistics.Negatives -- and why I don't give it 4 stars:* There are numerous typos (I have marked probably 100+ corrections within about 80% of the text) - this is inexcusable for a book in 6-th edition!* Its index can be longer for a book of this nature and size."
2,Not for the undergrad and non-math majors!!!!!!,This book is lacking for sensible sturcture. Seems to put a reader into a maze and leaves them wondering where there at. There are enough topics but their too full of proofs to really understand what the book is trying to explain. This book would even be diffucult for a graduate student that's using it for review. The author seems to be proving his mathematical talent instead of trying to explain the topics in a manor that's understandable to the average reader.
1,Where's the BEEF??? ...(the evidence),"This DVD's production is of a very low quality. It looks like the film maker used a home video camcorder to gather the footage. There was no ""incontrovertible"" evidence concerning the existence of or encounters with alien races.Most of the commentary footage was taken at a UFO convention somewhere in the west (California??). The characters the film maker interviewed gave the impression of ""very strange people"" and destroyed any credibility the film maker was trying to build. However, to the film's credit I did find the segment on the removal of alien objects from people's bodies mildly interesting. The surgeon interviewed was believable. Unfortunately the credibility of his contribution was destroyed by the questionable characters and footage of the rest of the film.I will most definately sell this DVD at my next yard sale as it is not worthy of a repeat viewing. I would advise you to find another documentary of a higher quality. This one was a dissappointment."
4,Not that bad,"In all fairness, I had to add my review. My daughter (10 yrs) has rented this movie twice from Hollywood where she gets it for 5 days and watches it every night of those five days. Obviously, it isn't as bad as the other reviewers would have you believe. It's apparently good enough that she asked for it for Christmas, as well. Is it as good as the other version by director David Wu? There really is no comparison. If you saw the theatrical version first, this one would likely be disappointing, as it would be if you expected it to meticuluosly follow the original fairy tale. However, it is entertaining to the young and deserving of viewing for those who enjoy cartoon fairy tales. She recommends it as one of the better movies for kids."
5,cartoon,"It is really good cartoon I will advice this for everyone,When I watched this cartoon I remembered my childhood"
2,Distasteful and over the top,"I just finished this book and have a hard time finding why so many people loved it. My book club selected it and we have not yet discussed it. It follows many of the southern dysfunctional family memoir/novels. I enjoyed The Liar's Club, Little Altars Everywhere and Running with Scissors which all have examples of appalling abuse mixed with humor. This has some interesting themes, Helen Keller, for example, but the ending is preposterous and extremely disturbing. It overshadows any enjoyment I had in the rest of the book."
2,Somewhat disappointing,"I love novels about the South, and this one started out well. I got the feeling, as I continued to read, that the author wasn't sure that his readers would get the messages (interconnectedness, the legacy of abuse, and others) that he is trying so hard to convey, so he had to beat us over the head with them. The excessive repetition of themes and the poor quality of the editing (""This...led [sic] credence to the myth that he subsided [sic] entirely on the stuff..."" - p. 186 - just one of multiple examples) were so annoying that I started skimming sections instead of reading every word. There was much that I liked, some instances that made me laugh out loud, but overall, not a book that I would recommend with enthusiasm."
2,Amateurish writing,"[...] The story is not bad- funny at times, but the writing is amateurish at best and has none of the effortless wit of Capote's. Stay away from this book."
1,just awful,"I don't know what this author had in mind when trying to write a book. It's so poorly constructed and over-written. I would say it's badly edited as well if I thought it had been edited at all. Bad Bad Bad. I threw it in the trash, too embarrassed to give it to anyone. I will not waste my money or time on another of this man's books."
2,Bewildering,"I read this book and was utterly bewildered by all of its rave reviews on Amazon.com. I finished the book though it was a plodding effort. I thought that the storyline and the writing were rather pedestrian. No spark or witticism to make this book anything special.Different strokes for different folks. Many reviewers may have like ""Bark of the Dogwood"" but his one missed me completely."
1,"book,not as presented","The book was in no was like new,even though I paid full price. It looked like water or something had gotten the book wet at one time. The spine of the book was so bad that if you turned the book over and open the pages fell out. it was underlined in the book as well with yellow highlighter which was ok but the overall book was not in good shape."
5,Good book,"My brother, the actor, was very happy to receive it. (And I don't have ten more words to say about it.)"
5,O'TOOLES CAMPANION BOOK,"THIS BOOK IS ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF MR. O'TOOLE'S EXPERIENCE AS AN APPRENTICE TO THE BEST THAT TROD THE BOARDS, TO BEING A GREAT PERSON IN HIS OWN RIGHT, AN ACTOR THAT CAN ADMIT HIS FAULTS AND LEARN FROM THEM, HE IS AN ACTOR WHO IS NOT IN DENIAL OF HIS WORK OR LIFE. THIS IS THE COMPANINON BOOK TO ""LOITERING WITH INTENT"" PLEASE IF YOU ENJOY A GOOD READ , THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST! ANNE"
1,impossible to review not recieved yet,"One must have the book in hands to review! To please do send it, then I will gladly part with my opinion"
3,Solid fusion gives way to predictable strucutres,"Like a folksier System of the Down, the band Gogol Bordello takes traditional gypsy styles and injects a snarling hipster angle. Although one can sense the pleasure many of these songs would play live (their talked about shows at festivals have steadily gained popularity and with it more fans) on the album they just sound a little too boxed in, repetitious, even a little cartoonish or stereotypical at times. It is a pleasure then, to encounter the gems that fine tune their unique approach like ""My Strange Uncles From Abroad"" or when they elevate the instrumentation, as on the triumphant closing title track."
3,Eastern European punk gypsy mash-up!,"Such a hard album to describe! Messy and drunken (yet not sloppy) but at the same time tight and crazy.... an awful lot of ground is covered here, musically. All that I could imagine while listening to Super Taranta! was an Eastern European mash-up of Mr. Bungle and Dropkick Murphys. Maybe they folks in The World/Inferno Friendship Society would be playing along, too... at night outdoors around a fire surrounded by gypsy debauchery. Can you imagine that? If you can, you've got a sense of what this album has to offer!I have no idea if this is typical of Gogol Bordello, but I can only imagine that Super Taranta! would meet or exceed the expectations of longtime fans. It certainly grabbed my attention! What can I say... give it a listen: I think there's plenty here to keep you interested, even if this sort of wackiness isn't normally your thing!"
5,Fun and Provocative,Very creative and original music. A curious fusion between rock and traditional Russian gypsey music.It can appeal to people of all ages who are open minded.Hutz's creative energy is infective.
4,daring to mix classics,"Maureen Mc.Govern with her powerful and make-everything-possible voice and style of singing, is in this quite intimistic item a very good recipe to sleep good and dream a nice dream. I like specially 'Let's fall in love'. And she's been a precursor on classical mixing in songbooks, at the point that the result is a new, fresh and personal composition. Arlen's or McGovern's, or both Arlen's and Mc Govern's? This talent is great."
4,GREAT READ!,"I love this book! However,the heroine, Emily, could have had more depth. The hero, Leon, is absolutely enchanting. He demonstrates an overwhelmingly intense maleness that is just mesmerizing. He's a combination of possesiveness and tenderness. The book is just FABULOUS!"
2,"2.5 stars, didn't live up to expectations....","2.5 stars. This one didn't provide the excitement and angst I was expecting to find with this non PC hero. The hero was in love with the heroine and had planed to marry her from pretty much the beginning of the book, and that sort of killed the fun of the chase for me since I'm not a fan of unrequited love from the hero's pov. Those of you that like that theme might enjoy this book though. The heroine's sister's infatuation with the hero kept the book lively for a while, but the heroine's TSTL personality made it hard to sympathize with her. The hero does cheat if you are concerned about that, but he had not consummated his marriage at the time. All in all it was not a terrible read, it just wasn't as engaging as I would have liked."
4,now hear this!,"as a hearing student just now entering the Deaf world, i found much of this book hard to read. i didn't want to be guilty by association of many of the prejudices, assumptions, & opressive acts that were described. i was saddened to think that the rather negative bias (though undoubtedly deserved) towards hearing people represented in this book might block me in developing many true relationships with Deaf people. i've, fortunately, found that not to be the case. the Deaf community is much like any other diverse community. the book did definitely help me to open my eyes to many things i was ignorant of & i even had to admit some stereotypical things about myself. i reccomend it to everyone despite their level of participation with this dynamic community."
1,This book ruined my ASL class,"This book was at times informative. However, I had to FORCE myself to read it, because I felt that every reading assignment given to me was going to involve me reading about what a jerk I am because I can hear.An example:In Chapter 40, the author addresses the way that deaf people describe hearing people. At the end of the chapter, it says, and I quote:""The terms used by deaf people to insult or poke fun at the hearing majority cannot compare with the nastiness of the terms the hearing majority has long used against us.""That makes it okay, then?Not by me. Promotion of such biased behavior no matter what the justification is not justice to me. It's just promoting cultural intolerance and the writers of this book should be ashamed. The whole book is full of things like this.If I could give it negative stars, I would. Twice."
4,:) Fast delivery.. nice pendant,This was very nice in person... a little smaller than i thought.. it was 2 inches like stated but that was including the clasp..which was stated as well.. i must have missed that . All and all though very nice .The delivery was so quick. I did do express delivery but it was still very fast even for that . I believe i ordered it on a Tuesday afternoon and received it the next day!
2,not the stuff dreams are made of,"most of the tracks on this cd are available elsewhere, but what prompts me to give this a low review is the quality of the recording. some of them sound like they were taped off of a tv set showing a warbly print. you can do better elsewhere."
2,Music from Humphrey Bogar Movies,"I was disappointed. I thought I would be getting a CD of full length themes from his movies but the CD is exactly what it says. It is from the actual films, in sections and pieces. I can't say it was misrepresented so I guess I was at fault. But I am sorry I bought it."
4,Start of a legend...,"This 1967 album features some of the earliest recorded work of Brazilian samba superstar Beth Carvalho, who was the ""girl"" singer in a pop vocals/jazz band that also featured pianist Antonio Adolfo."
2,Actually not worth the money.,"The markers we got were not washable ones. Also, the chalk breaks apart so easily. It's a cute idea and the main body of the Easel is sturdy. The letters are really tiny so not good for a young toddler. We're goingto get a stand-up easel for our grandson in a few months. They're of course more expensive but will be worth it."
1,Don't be fooled!,"This book is meant for someone who already has a vast amount of knowledge on the subject. The book has errors in some equations and the graphs are poorly explained. The notation for the equations needs to be organized such that the reader can readily figure out what is what. This book gives equation and then you must hunt through a sea of words (sometimes not on the same page) to find out what the notation means. Values from graphs are often needed to solve the chapter problems, however the values are not obvious and often you have to guess. This allows for errors in your calculations if you don't use the same value the grader used. Furthermore, this book has endless references at the end of every chapter which feels like a cut and paste job when you are reading it, no smooth transitions."
4,Good book,"The book was a bit dirty on the cover, but it was still in very good condition when recieved and very fast shipping."
2,Overblown. Disappointing.,"I had had this book on my bookshelf for the past few years and finally decided to read it last week. Given the awards it had received, I had high hopes for it. Unfortunately, I found it very uneven. The book is disjointed, with the accounts of the battle interspersed with an account of the author trying to be a gentleman farmer. I don't think he pulled it off however, although the idea of the book is an interesting one. There is not enough information to satisfy the Civil War buff, nor is there enough development about the author's own story to have made me care that much about his travails. It is not a bad book, but only a mediocre one. I would not recommend it."
4,"Kit was fine, but...",The kit fit fine on my 2001 Ford Expedition. Ship time was longer than expected. One kit arrived missing a cam washer. Contacted Amazon and they had another complete kit shipped to me within two days. Just in time for my weekend project.
4,We were there!,"My family lived through the war. They lived in the town of Noordwijkerhout and its surroundings going back over 400 years. I was born during the latter part of the war. However, 11 of my siblings are older than I and a number of them were in their teens during the war. Based on the many personal stories of the war I grew up with, the movie provides a realistic review of the war and the occupation. It all took place not very far from our town. It is a gift to have a very well made movie remind us of what the war felt like. The movie is nuanced and moving. I bought a copy of the movie for myself but also to show my family and my friends.Although our family emigrated to the U.S. in 1952, it has always maintained strong connections through my extended family and the families of the many spouses (in-laws) who remained behind. Thank you for the movie. It is a great gift to have seen it and to be able to show it to others."
3,Great performance from young hero ...,"Caught between loyalty to his father, a mayor of a small town in German occupied Holland, and the resistance movement in which he unwittedly gets caught up in, a young Dutch boy helps an English airman to escape to safety.Two aspects of the movie don't hold quite true : the young boy possesses a fine looking stallion which would surely have been confiscated by the Germans for their war effort. In an attempted escape that has to be aborted the easily identified boy is not hunted down by the Germans.Otherwise lovely performances by the youngsters in the cast and the tension of the war time situation is pretty much well maintained throughout."
5,Very good,"Films like this remind me of what it really took to survive during this time, and how during war, it brings out the good and bad in everyone."
5,Exquisite telling of a painful story,"I was surprised at just how good this film was. Surprised because I had read weak reviews and passed on seeing this film on the big screen.Were those critics wrong.This was an incredible film on all fronts: the visuals, the quality of the cinematography, the story, itself. It's not merely acoming of age type of story. It's just very good story-telling about a very disturbing time--where so many suffered. With all of the Holocaust films coming out over the past few years (it's practically a genre, by now), it's important to have a story where so many others during WWII suffered, as well, and seemingly without end. I'm still wondering why there has not been a story based on the invasion of Poland--where so many innocent civilians were slaughtered by the Nazis. (Perhaps, there is one or two, I am just not aware of them). Anyway--this was a gorgeous and moving film that went well beyond my expectations.A terrific choice for teens--yes--but also, everyone else, too."
5,outstanding movie,Must watch if you like WW II movies. My in laws lived during that time and the movie is like how they described it. Translation is accurate.
5,Winter in Wartime - a great foreign film,"This film is in Dutch with some German spoken and with English subtitles. I think it is a very exciting war movie and has several good story lines that made the movie a wonderful experience. It shows Nazis as regular people, and as ""monsters"" - just like in any society at any time in history. I hope you try, and enjoy, this movie. I do want to note there isn't a lot of shooting and blowing things up like Saving Private Ryan, but there are scenes of graphic violence you should be aware of. There is also some small amount of sexual content. Having said that, I think a child of 12 or older would be fine watching the movie."
3,Manipulative and predictable,"I don't want to pat on my own shoulders, but I figured out the end halfway through the movie.Paul Verhoeven's ""Black Book"" and his older WWII Dutch movies had a huge impact on me. I could even say that ""Black Book"" is one of my all-time favorite movies. ""Winter in Wartime"" was okay. Watch it if you are in the mood and if you don't have anything else to watch."
2,Not Good!!!,"I know everyone is praising this movie, but I didn't like it at all. I am a WWII collector and historian, and the movie was absolutely dull. The character development was non-existant, the action was nowhere to be found, and the story was really boring. I didn't care at all about the subtitles, but the movie wasn't good. The part I really hated was the RAF pilot. His character was bland and very ungrateful. The poor boy lost his father, horse, and uncle as a direct result of helping the pilot. He even lost his sister in the end as she had to run away with her new British man. I don't care if people think it is good, because it isn't. A movie like Letters from Iwo Jima is so much better and well produced than this. Winter in Wartime is a movie I will never recommend to anyone. I realize my opinion is just that, but the movie is not good!"
2,Should be better,"There is some decent info, but the worst part is how outdated the numbers and addresses are! You go to call a company and they're gone! Same with addresses--I had many queries returned to me because the company was no longer there. So then, what's the point of the book if you can't get ahold of the people?"
3,Old But Still Useful,"I found this older version still to have some useful information. As we all know, Hollywood is forever changing and this should be considered before purchasing."
4,Bill Cosby review,It was wonderful to hear the material from when I was younger. My father had a bunch of Bill Cosby records that we all listened to.
5,"Some of ""Bill's best"" comedy bits","This is a collection of some of ""Bill's best"" comedy bits and is hysterically funny and clean!"
5,Don't miss this one!,"I remember hearing this album back when I was young. 30 years later it is still hilarious and my children love it. Good clean humor, which is is short supply these days."
3,fun but not what I expected,Too long a narration; got stale; had some funny parts but I was mostly disappointed; wish I had a stream-lined version
5,Funny,I bought this to share with my little boy. I grew up listening to his albums and my son loved it
4,This Album is classic!,Cosby is a legend. You have to own this album if you have any interest in listening to his comedy. I enjoyed some renditions of these skits a little better elsewhere but this is a great copulation.
5,"Good, clean fun!","I remember listening to this album with my brother when we were little; it made us crack up. Now, after hearing it for the first time in over 20 years, it still cracks me up! I would recommend this cd for anyone looking for a really good laugh!"
2,Didn't Like the Warrior or the Bride 1 1/2 star?,"""A Warrior's Bride"" was my seventh book by this author and the seventh in the series of 14 books. This book is my least favorite of all so far. I just couldn't get into these characters. I can't say I like either one of them. I got through it and I would say it was O.K. I have the entire series so I didn't want to stop reading it even though I had thought about doing so. These stories are not racey by any means. I am used to reading Bertrice Smalls books that have very erotic love scenes. I wasn't sure if I would like this series but they are kind of refreshing but they could use a little more charm & sexual romance. One interesting thing is all the books have around the same number of pages? A short quick read. I would not recommend this book if you want to read just the one of the series."
3,"Okay, but misses the point...","As a travel case this is nice, as a mini-disc storage thing it is lousy...CaseLogic usually has some savvy concerning audio storage but they seem to have missed the boat on this one... One of the main reasons minidiscs are so popular is because we can make so many recordings from different sources on them.Inevitably any minidisc recorder owner is going to end up with a collection of minidiscs much larger than any CD collection anyone else had (remember how many audio tapes you used to have way back when?) and will need much more storage space than this little duff-kit of a bag..."
5,Perfect,"I looked for this for years. Lent it out a long time ago and never got it back.It is nostalgic, but it seems less cute than when first seen."
5,Delightful and Enchanting,"I loved reading this book. The third book of Ruskin Bond's that I have read. Some chapters are several pages, and the shorter ones are 3-4 pages (short stories). The book draws you in and shows the humane view of life in the Indian foothills of the Himalays. Having met Ruskin Bond myself in 1998 in Mussoorie, reading this book was more interesting. I read it to soft Indian music in the backround, which heightened the realism. It was a great book and I also recommend two of his other books I read: The Room on the Roof, and The Night Train at Deoli."
4,Great Gospel Music,Very good songs. I just wish that they werfe by the original artists. The singers are good on here but it is not quiet the same. I still liked it very much.
4,CASTING IS A MYSTERY,"I really enjoy British mysteries, and the adult actors in this production I recognized from other productions I've seen. Most of them were very good. And Gielgud was the best thing about this show. But why, with all this talent about, would you hire someone so strange for the leading role -- a lady who runs around with a stupid and meaningless smile and who has the weirdest posture and ambulation of any actor ever. Whatever else this series had going for it, and I enjoyed every other part, this flaw really stood out. I don't understand it, but there it is."
2,Nyeh...,"I did not enjoy this beastly film. Gielgud has appeared in many wonderful films, and a few terrible ones, and this one I feel falls into the latter category. He plays an unwanted dirty old lech who tricks a tense, unlikable family into taking him along to Italy where he hovers about the windows outside smoking cigars and chortling to himself as their lives go steadily and sadly awry. Most unpleasant. Skip this one, even though it was once shown on PBS' ""Masterpiece Theatre,"" and go find yourself a real masterpiece instead."
2,Disappointed,"I had high hopes for this series based on the title, but was deeply disappointed with the story line. Starring John Guilgood, I expected a quality viewing experience, but was so dissappointed I didn't finish viewing the third DVD."
5,Pleasant Suprise,"These are very good, excellent snack for those on a gluten free diet. While I wouldn't say they are ""jumbo"" in size product is still a good value buy."
5,My Favorite betty Lou's snack,"I love these cherry fruit bars. They have great ingredients. They are satisfying, and so tasty! (I love to heat them and top with vanilla frozen yogurt.) I will be ordering more!"
1,THESE ARE NOT GLUTEN FREE!!!!!,If you are buying these because it says they are gluten free - they are not! Look at the ingredients. They contain BARLEY FLOUR which is definitely NOT gluten free.
2,Very disappointed.,"I thought this watch looked very cool. I have a Swiss, analog watch right now and wanted a nice looking digital watch to alternate wearing with the Swiss. I received the Pulsar for Christmas this year and out of the box the watch felt solid and looked pretty impressive.Unfortunately, after about 15 minutes a row of the digital display went out.The display was too dim for my tastes to begin with.And the kicker...the menu button was flaky as well. It was too difficult to push in while I was wearing it. I had to take the watch off and press pretty hard to get the menu to appear.A previous reviewer said they ""wanted to like"" the watch. I feel the same way. But I must combine the need for functionality w/the desire for handsome gadgetry.This watch is heading back to the manufacturer."
3,not official Nintendo product,works fine but not Nintendo official product as stated in the ad. if I would have known that I would have bought a cheaper one.
3,Works great!,"This replacement power supply works great, looks just like the original. Nice price, great product, just wish the original hadn't died..."
2,Worked,It worked for what we needed but it just feels cheap. I would spend the money on a better one next time if needed
1,can I give it zero stars,"First off, let me say I wish I had read the reviews before buying this product. I was led astray (as many others) by the ""Official"" in the title. This does NOT equate to OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer),The new unit did indeed power up my Wii, but causes an electronic pulse (looks like a static bar) through my television that makes it impossible to play any games."
1,Not official - knockoff,"This is a knockoff power supply, I haven't even plugged it in yet because these are known to have problems. It's lightweight it's dark gray and nintendo's logo is missing."
2,Not Nintendo Official!,This works but it is not a Nintendo official product as stated in the ad. if I would have known that I would have bought a cheaper one.
3,"Works, but...Not an Official Nintendo Product","I purchased this item to make moving our Wii to another room easier and for that it does the job. Only problem I have is that this is advertised as a Nintendo Wii Official AC Power Supply, which it is not, It is a third party replica. This wouldn't be an issue if I was not looking for a Licensed/Official product and was not concerned with the quality of its internals. My recommendation to potential buyers is - if you looking for something that will work and you have a decent surge protector or aren't too concerned with the quality of the power supply your purchasing, than this is a great deal. My recommendation to the seller is - edit the listing so that it describes your product correctly, because honesty is in fact the best policy, especially in commerce."
1,Misleading / Quite a rip off,"The real issue here is that there is no information on the website which states that this adaptor is not an original Nintendo product.Post plugging this adaptor in, there is a lot wavy disturbance (in more than 50% of my games)My recommendation - DO NOT TOUCH this product, go get an ORIGINAL (may cost 3 times more but its worth it)"
1,CHEAP WORTHLESS POWER SUPPLY,"This is not a ""Nintendo Wii Official AC Charger Power Supply"". It is very deceiving putting ""official"" in the title. This is a worthless, cheap, lightweight power supply. Do not be fooled. Do not buy."
3,DON'T BUY BEFORE YOU TRY THIS!!!,"It just may be that your original power supply is NOT dead!First, UNPLUG your ""dead"" power supply (from the wall outlet) and LEAVE IT UNPLUGGED for AT LEAST 30 minutes. Plug it back in - voila! Problem solved.A friend told me about this trick after talking to Nintendo tech support, and sure enough - IT WORKED!I can't say how good this particular replacement is - I bought a different one before I learned of this trick, but the one I got was not original either (and much lighter and more cheaply made), so I gave this one 3 stars (a neutral review). I would definitely heed the warnings of the other reviewers here."
1,Not a Nintendo product,"I was disappointed to see that this is not an official Nintendo product. The description on Amazon should include the text from the package: ""This is a Hyperkin(R) product and is not endorsed, manufactured or distributed by Nintendo."" This power cord is not UL Listed/Certified. There are so many similar listings for Wii Power Adapters on Amazon it is very confusing, but to claim this is a 'Nintendo Wii Official' product should not be allowed. I am still trying to get a Nintendo-endorsed product from this company, which responded to me saying they don't offer a real Nintendo adapter, but has a different Amazon listing (Nintendo-RVL-002-Wii-AC-Power-Adapter/dp/B0033QISHU/) for a Wii Power adapter that includes the claim ""This adapter is original and of Nintendo Brand."" Seems pretty close to false advertising to me."
2,SWEEP THIS ALBUM UNDER THE RUG!,"Alanis has done what, three albums to date. Jagged Little Pill is flawless, Super Infaturation was just a disaster (sophomore jinx) and now we have Under Rug Swept. Well, the album is mediocre. Too much language/lyrics in her songs, its good that she is writing some of her own songs, but still....Alanis has a long way to go. She has changed, maturely, but the lyrical content has got to go. For the customers that are skeptical about buying this album, I would reconsider before spilling out 17 bucks for this mediocre album....Nothing new here. I would suggest buying Natalie Merchant's Motherland or Indigo Girl's new album --- those are masterpieces compared to this album.1.5 stars"
3,"Is Alanis really ""A MAN""","Alanis has made two previous albums which were excellent however this time around the album leaves a lot to be desired. The song 'Hands Clean"" is by far the best track on the album, followed by "" A Man'. A song is which Alanis describes herself as being ""a man who has grown from a son"" an all that. I know that these words are not always to be taken literally but come on Alanis were you ever a man. The rest of the album is just a repetition of similar beats and moods that Supposed Former...... portrayed. The album could used a lot more work and what's with that eleven track foolishness. Give me eleven tracks if all are good otherwise about four more 'filler' songs would do just fine."
1,the point of no return,this is where alanis was made herself no longer valid in the good music industry.
1,Under Rug Swept...Thats is where it Belongs,I never learn my lesson. I was a bog Alanis fan but her last 2 albums have been one worse then the other. It is the same whinning Alanis and complaining with all this time off you would have thought she would have matured as a artist. The title says it all Sweep it under the rug and keep it there.
4,A Grand Finale for Her first Trilogy of Albums...,"I actually got this cd back in April, but for some unknown reason, I just never put it in. It must have been some subconscious dwelling in my mind that told me ""ALanis is done, this album will be boring"" Anyway, when I finally gave it a listen, I was blown away. the opening track demands your attention, as does A MAN, which is a riveting new perspective from Ms M. YOU OWE ME NOTHING IN RETURN for me, is the highlight of the album. We can only hope to evolve to such a level of emotional security, and selfless love that is displayed in this beautiful track. I urge you to get this album, its much less convaluted than the second album, JUNKIE (which I know, from my own experience, had the ability to lose the listener). UNDER RUG SWEPT truly belongs IN STEREO PLAYED."
4,Alanis returns with a solid set -,"After Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie I was a abit leary to buy Alanis' latest release. I haven't been dissapointed. The single ""Hands Clean"" is lyrically brilliant, albit a bit awkwardly phrased at times. I believe the standout track to be ""So Unsexy"", perhaps the most emotionally accessible song for listeners. The song touches on those moments when we feel incapacitated to be who we are, feeling so unsexy but being so beautiful. The Me'shell Ndegeocello bassline in this track punches the lyrics in a smart and efficient manner. Definitely a standout. I wish I could comment on more of the album, but I'm slowly digesting track by track, but I have no doubt listeners familiar with Alanis' work will NOT be dissapointed with this latest release. Alanis should be proud of this compilation - it's the most touching and (seemingly) personal album to date.rave on.jason."
4,"Back to the ""old"" days","I have been a fan of Alanis' since JLP. Her new album, ""Under Rug Swept"" takes you back to the JLP days. From the addicting sounds of ""Hands Clean"" to the beautiful ballad ""Flinch"" ALanis has once again proved why she is so talented. Reading the critics reviews makes one wonder: Why is it a crime to write a song that doesnt rhyme? Alanis' writing style shows that not only can you write beautiful words...but when you put them to music it makes you even more of a special artist. Some standouts include: Surrendering, So Unsexy, Hands Clean and Flinch. URS is not as heavy as Suppose Former Infatuation Junkie nor is it as radio friendly as JLP. However, its a great album that I HIGHLY recommend. WELCOME BACK ALANIS!"
5,from a junkie,"This is a great follow-up. I didn't even know that she was releasing a new CD until I saw it coming to work this morning, stopped, bought it and have had it in my office computer for five hours straight and STILL haven't gotten through the entire CD b/c I keep replaying songs.Unlike other CD's I've bought that I have to listen to repeatedly before I can distinguish one song from the next (Natalie Merchant comes to mind-altho I love her in the end), Alanis instantly commands your attention fresh and new with each cut. I loved her from the beginning and I get flack for it, but this one is going in heavy rotation for quite awhile.Buy IT!!"
4,I guessss.,"I don't know what to think about this album. We're so used to her having a meaning behind every album, but this album's different. It's like she said, ""Uh gee, I feel like making another album."" I guess that's why this album feels so commercial and that there was no effort behind it. If you don't get that impression from the songs, the album cover and booklet should unquestionably say so. But so far, ""I guessss"" it's pretty good...for Alanis fans, that is."
3,Just Average!,"After listening to Alanis' new effort many times I can only conclude that her ""name"" and not the merits of this album are leading to such great reviews on here!The album is certainly good and is definitely superior to a lot of the garbage that is released. However, this album is not on the level of her last two efforts, especially the brilliant 'Infactuation Junkie.'I really like the first two or three songs, but after that - the album does nothing special, nothing inspiring, nothing great. It's just there - sort of like fluffer material.I still love this woman's honesty and her powerful lyrics - they are present throughout this album, but it's just not a complete package in my opinion."
3,Alanis What's Been Swept Under the Rug,"Under Rug Swept? What was swept under the rug? I'll tell you what, the edge her music used to have. Although her last release wasn't the dark sharp edged compilation that Jagged little Pill was, this latest album is so rounded it's lost all sense of an edge.The music, although not ""bad"" just does not seem to have the emotion that previous Alanis CDs have had, it's something I expect more out of a teen pop group... very disapointing."
2,i guess i was a little too hyped,"I was looking forward to this album for a long time. Ever since it was announced in the summer, i believe. She had promised she would return to the sounds of Jagged Little Pill, so i expected some angst. And while i'm glad that she's happy, i just cant see her in that same light. She's simply better at making angry songs. And this CD sounds very happy, and a little more poppy than her other albums. I dont know if its just me, but all bands seem to be getting more poppy on later releases. THis includes No Doubt, the Cranberries, and many others... There are few that would even be indecisable enough to get played on the radio, and the first song is the hardest song on the album which is quite disappointing. I hope you are happy alanis in the path you have chosen to quick fame and a quick comeback by creating radio friendly songs."
3,School Newspaper Review,"Alanis Morissette is back with her first studio album in four years. Just like her previous album, she expresses her thoughts, and emotions in the music and lyrics. She certainly expresses her thoughts and emotions through the words and melodies in her songs. Alanis Morissette expresses many different things throughout her songs. Her values and morals are shown inthe song ""21 Things I Want In A Lover"". She sings about a range of topics in songs such as ""Flinch"" and her hit, ""Hand's Clean"". She has developed into a more mature song writer than before. It appears that she is trying to change from her previous ways. This album is rather better than her past albums. If you enjoyed her earlier music, or music by other artists such as Tori Amos, Sheryl Crow, or Natalie Imbruglia then you would like to getthis album."
4,"Alanis, Alanis, Alanis","True-Alanis Morissette is my fav singer.True-Her songs kick arseTrue-I only gave it 4 starsHow could i do such a thing? Well, actually i'd give it 4 1/2 stars if i could, but i can't. Anywho, Alanis Morisette's new Album ""Under Rug Swept"" comes DANGEROUSLY close to being as great as ""Jagged Little Pill"" & ""Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie"" but it just doesn't cut it. Instead of being the edgy, anything but ""I love You, You love me, But I love Him"" Alanis we know, it's more of discovering her world and who she is album. E.G. ""Precious Illusions"" talks more of waking up & noticing that the world ISN'T a fairytale, & ""Hands Clean""(i believe)is of a relationship under the table. Obviously, these songs are different from ""Thank-U"" and ""You Oughta Know"" but Morissette still pleases her fans w/""'Rug Swept""Rock on Alanis"
1,Is it just me?,"I've never been a huge fan, but the last single from this album just sounds like a big Ani Difranco rip-off to me. For the people out there saying they've never liked Alanis, but like this album....do yourself a favor and buy any one of Difranco's albums instead."
4,another great album from alanis,the only thing i was disappointed w/ is that your computer will only read the enhanced-cd section. the album tracks are only playable in a stereo or cd player.
4,Good to hear,This album is really good. Alanis produced the album herself this time around without Glen Ballard who she worked with on her previous two. The music is arranged very well. The lyrics are her usual fanfare for those who like her messages. All in all I would recommend this album.
5,terrific autonomy,"She is real, and honest, and bold, and true, and makes totally unrythmic words meld beautifully into song. Her voice is clear and strong and her subject matter is healing and independent. Yay, Alanis!"
2,Very Ordianary,"Alanis Morissette is Arguably one of the Most Over-Hyped Acts over the Past Decade easily.when She first Arrived in Her Post Disco/Pop Era She seemed like something different.""You Outta Know"" was a catchy but in your face song.since then with&without Glenn Ballard She has came close to that Intensity&Almost matched it with various songs but this Album shows Why She still hasn't Surpased those Heights.She matches the Production but the songs themselves seem to Formula Driven to me.they are missing Drive&Depth.Vocally&Lyrically not much has changed.She can take a few years off if She keeps the Formula going.it's cool She has Label Mate or I should I Say Former Label Mate MeShall'Nede'ocello on it.it's cool to see Her still doing Her thing but this Album is another Easy Cash in overall."
4,Arguably her best album,"This album just feels less like mainstream pop music and more like artistic expression. A few of the songs have such exceptional lyrics that they almost always move me. The music is good, in some places excellent. For the most part, though, it feels more like background for the lyrics. This is not necessarily a bad thing. It's always been her words that have held power over me. The accompanying music, with rare exception (Uninvited being the prime example I can think of), is more like an interesting distraction.My two favorites are tracks 4 (Flinch) and 5 (So Unsexy), for their ability to emotionally jar me. Both have strong themes of a struggle to master emotions that have unwanted control over her. Like a cry out in despair, ""why can't I get over this?"""
4,Bring Back Glen Ballard!,"I'm not a big fan, in fact I don't like, much of Glen Ballard's work. However, his work with Alanis Morissette on her two previous albums was pure genius. While she continues to write some of the greatest lyrics ever, Alanis Morissette just isn't quite up to taking on the composing and producing chores on her own. With a little work, Under Rug Swept could have been as great as Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie. However, the under-cooked music just isn't up to the level of the soul-baring lyrics. Still, I consider it to be a must-have album."
4,trendy boppers go home!,"for all of the alanis haters out there- go back to britney! if you crave music that has any substance to it, then you'll listen to alanis. every woman needs a good man-bashing CD in their collection, and this one doesn't bash nearly as much as Jagged Little Pill did! i loved it simply for it's substance and ability to try a new direction. i enjoyed almost every song on this one. a good buy if you like alanis, but a bad buy if you enjoy ""factory produced"" music. a lot of 3LW fans probably won't like this CD."
5,Great CD from Alanis,"She has grown so much musically. This is a great CD. I didn't like it at first at all, but I listened to it a while ago and I can see how great it is. People may say that JLP is a better CD, but it's not. They are totally different CDs, different music, and she sounds better now. She is much more mature and in touch with herself now, and it's great to listen to."
4,My review,I reccomend Under Rug Swept! It is hard to find a female singer that can actully sing. This album is a mixture of pop and soft rock! The best song is Narcissus.
3,It has its moments,"Under Rug Swept isn't a bad album, but I wouldn't list it amongst my favorite female rock albums either. I really like the Indian flavor of many of the tracks on Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie. Under Rug Swept is basically back to a more generic pop-rock sound; similar to Jagged Little Pill, but definitely more mature both musically and lyrically. Alanis' penchant for switching the logical order of words (the album's title is a perfect example) and love of stressing awkward syllables and words in a line for the sake of the melody has always driven me nuts and will apparently continue to.For whatever my complaints, there are some really good tracks on the album though. Hands Clean and Narcissus are strong songs. It's nice to hear Alanis singing from a different point of view in A Man. So Unsexy and You Owe Me Nothing feel a lot like my life."
2,not a return to rock,"while if it is your type of music this is a fine cd -- i loved her first cd, jagged little pill, and was told that this was a return to it after the softer 'supposed former infatuation junkie' -- it is not. it's a little too poppy and not nearly as good since i really liked the rock aspect of jagged little pill -- and its not as inventive as supposed former infatuation junkie so it doesn't maintain that benefit...but i guess if you like alanis morrisette you might like it anyways....."
3,Good In Its Own Right,Worst Tracks:21 Things I Want In a loverBest Tracks:NarcissusSo UnsexyHands CleanPrecious IllusionsUtopia
2,Not one of her best.,"I bought this despite reading other reviews,mistake I should have heeded the warnings. This is not one of Ms. Morissette's best works. The music is edgy and lacks her usual quality in composition. Oh well, she is still very talented and I will look forward to her next work, it has to be better."
1,Alanis,"is just more proof of what sheep will buy.No matter how bad their voice,music,etc is, it can still be succesful(tori amos is another example).Alanis has been singing the same wishy-washy pop rock for practically a decade now, and we're all buying it.Alanis has been crowned rock godess.I had to laugh at the guy who called Alanis ""the Janis Joplin"" of our generation.Anyone who's reading this, what do you have to say about this.She can't sing too.She just whines at the top of her lungs.Yeah, some good singing.And I don't care HOW many negative reviews I get for this."
2,"Awful, by Chloe F.","This is so boring. All Alanis ever does is whine and complain about her betraying boyfriend and how his girlfriend will make a really excellent mother. I owned this for a minimum 4 1/2 years and I didn't really listen to it. And what's up with Alanis being obsessed with being a man now and being a man?! Is she transgendered or something?!Alanis is a sick, whiney, bitchy freak. Do not buy this CD. You will regret it and it will haunt you the rest of your life."
1,Lower if I could for technical reasons.,"The music on the album itself is not bad. Not good, either. I found it to be mediocre. I would give the music itself about 3 stars.My primary issue is with the CD itself. The CD has been written in such a way so as to prevent it from being read in a CD-ROM drive. Ostensibly, this is to prevent piracy. However, this assumes that I was going to pirate the music and prevents me from playing the CD (which I paid for) on my computer at work (which I have the legal right to do so). I resent the presumption that I am going to be a thief ? either in stealing music from someone else or in aiding and abetting someone else in stealing music from me.I will not purchase any CD that is produced is this manner; I will not purchase any more music from this studio."
4,She's Still Got It!,"Upon first listen, I have to admit that I thought it was a little too ""radio."" But after a few more, it really grew on me. Please ignore the critics and reviewers who say ""... as with her previous two albums, Under Rug Swept is marred by unabridged stream-of-consciousness lyrics. Her awkward syntax and distorted phrasing disorients music that's melodious and compelling."" Aaargh!!! To me, that is one of the most appealing aspects of Alanis and her music! In times when almost any other female vocalist's tunes can be mistaken for ""The Theme from Titanic"", this CD is a refreshing and much welcomed change of pace! Musically, there's not much happening. It's really the phrashing and the lyrical content that make URS a must-own!"
4,Why I like Alanis...,"In reading a review of her new album in a magazine, the only thing that the reviewer had to say they he disliked was Alanis' stream-of-consciousness lyrics. That sometimes her rhythm is difficult to follow, and that it's hard to sing with her at times.That's exactly why I like her music so much. Unlike any other artist that I know, she writes her music from instinct and doesn't overwork her stuff. That gives her a quality that I find hard to explain, but that I enjoy quite a bit.This latest album follows quite nicely after ...Junkie, headed up by the best song, Hands Clean. For those who find Alanis too angst-ridden to listen to, you may find that she's lightened up, though her songs still contain power and insight."
2,don't bother,I was so disappointed by this cd. I loved her first one and played it all the time. The second one wasn't as good but I still liked it. This third cd has gone down another big notch. I'm kinda tired of hearing her whine about her failed relationships. The songs all basically sound the same. Nothing really catchy at all. The cd is also really short but after listening to it that turned into a plus. If you really have to have this cd just because it's her (like I had to) I would buy it used. I guarantee there will be a lot of used ones to buy. As a matter of fact you can buy mine.
2,Where's the music?,"I was so excited to run out and get Ms. A's latest. I loved her ""Jagged Little Pill"", her live album AND the last one ""Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie"".Where are the driving instrumentals? The lyrics and emotion that many of us have come to love AND that many of us could relate to...??I found her latest was discordant, disjointed and displeasing. This is just a stream of conciousness totally self absorbed babble-fest. Maybe I am obtuse, but I just don't get it Alanis. To be fair, a couple of the cuts were OK. But the rest? See above.I would really think twice before I made this purchase."
4,Good effort,"Alanis' 2002 album UNDER RUG SWEPT is a good album, for the most part. She only falters on the songs ""So Unsexy"", ""That Particular Time"", and ""Precious Illusions"". Otherwise its a seamless album, filled with great songs. It opens with the rockin ""21 Things I Want In A Lover"", and into the sarcastically funny ""Narcissus"". ""Hands Clean"" was the first single, a nice song reflecting on a May/December romance. ""Flinch"" is an absolutely brilliant acoustic song, a definite highlight on the set. ""You Owe Me Nothing in Return"" is my personal favorite on the album. ""A Man"" and ""Surrendering"" are also highlights from the set, just great songs. She closes with ""Utopia"", an idealistic song about the perfect society. I think it's a good follow up to her 1998 album SUPPOSED FORMER INFATUATION JUNKIE, which was art in itself, so to follow it up is pretty hard. UNDER RUG SWEPT is a solid album for the most part though."
4,Chick Rock!,"I tend to lean towards female singers, but not necessarily mainstream artists. I sincerely appreciate singer/songwriters especially. I picked up 'Under Rug Swept' because I couldn't get the song 'Hands Clean' out of my head. Track 2, 'Narcissus', is definitely my favorite on the album. This album is a definite change from 'Jagged Little Pill'. It is not quite so angry (unfortunately) but I like it. I will admit that it took a couple listens, but now I am hooked on its mellowed out music and intelligent lyrics."
5,Her best work yet...,"Similar to the brutally honest and emotional lyrics in 'Jagged Little Pill' Alanis is back with a number of songs that are both relevant and validating to many peoples' everyday trials and tribulations.Unlike the softer version of Alanis' 'Supposed Former Infatuation Junky', Alanis brings forth her raw emotions in 'Under Rug Swept.'An interesting, blazing guitar in '21 things...' is truly unique. It brings us back to the powerful music and striking lyrics comparable to 'You Oughta Know'.I would absolutly recommend this album to anyone, regardless of whether they have purchased any of Alanis' former albums or not. It is a true work of art that will revitalize anyone's spirit."
2,Take Away This Woman's Prozac!,"Even ""Supposed Former..."" had more of an edge on it than this. Gone is the rage. Gone is the energy. Gone is my interest.Only the title track even comes close, and that's a distant close, to Jagged-Little-Pill-worthy. Alanis seems to have reinvented herself as cut-rate Enya.Alanis, if you're out there, go out, have a bad relationship, start a bar fight with Ani Difranco - get [mad].The brilliant woman who gave us Jagged Little Pill is in there. Let her out!"
3,I Wish I Could Tell Alanis...,"Dear Alanis Morissette: You can sing, you can use the English language beyond what is commonly used in popular music. This is incredible. SO UNSEXY and A MAN are works of art. But you must get over these terrible relationships ... they placed a dark cloud on this recording. The long words used on disfunctional partnerships is wearing thin. You definitely have the talent, please apply it to a blissfully happy song about something that is working in life. Thank You for reading, Alanis, and anyone else. I look forward to your exhuberence."
3,little replay value,"It's been months and months since I've last listened to this album. After listening to it again, one thing that strikes me is that it has no long term replay value. Some songs, like ""Hands Clean"" and ""So Unsexy"", still mostly hold up. The rest of them, however, sound either forgettable or are actually becoming annoying and are grating on my nerves. My first impressions of the album were favorable when it was released, but as time goes by the less impressed I am with this album. It might be the songwriting, which really is just heavy-handed."
2,an American in Paris,"I'm a big fan of morissette but I have to admit I'm fairly disappointed with this album after such a long wait. Especially since I found the 3 unreleased songs on the unplugged album so good. I thought it would be a taste of things to come; not so. I only like about 4 of the songs on this album and I find, along with other reviewers, that her lyrics are stale and uninteresting. I think she has enormous talent but I think she needs to go in a different direction next time."
4,SHE STILL HAS SOME FIRE IN HER STYLE,"I'm glad to hear that Alanis did away with the dark,gloomy sounding music that plagued a lot of songs on Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie. Her new work,Under Rug Swept,showcases some of the creative ways she sings and flows with her voice,as you will hear in the first two tracks. The whole thing is not as great as Jagged Little Pill,but still a really good,solid album...check it out!"
5,"Keep em comin', Alanis!","Under Rug Swept is definitely the best CD of Alanis' career as of yet. Every single song has its own charm to embrace, and you can listen to them over and over and never get tired of them. Alanis' strongpoint has always been in her lyrics, and I love to sing along with this CD.My favourite songs are the first four: ""21 Things That I Want In a Lover"": because it's fun and the lyrics are great, sometimes you even have to laugh. ""Narcissus"" is cheeky and upbeat. Obviously I have to include ""Hands Clean"", this album's reminiscent single. And ""Flinch"", being on the slower side, stills bears a positive message. Another good song is ""Surrendering"".If you don't have this CD yet, all I can say is that you had better have a good excuse for waiting. This is a must-have!!!"
5,Another great album from Alanis,"Alanis has put out another great album. It seems she is growing as an artist and redefining her sound with each new album. This album is not quite as angry as the first, but not as mellow as the second. Fans need to realize that the best musicians don't simply try to rehash old material, but coninuously try to reninvent themselves. Just look at such artist as Neil Young and Bob Dylan. I really like the songs Flinch, so Unsexy and Hands Clean. This album should have many hit singles, and let's hope it helps to usher in a new era of the singer/songwriter that has gotten lost in the current trends of pop music."
5,My first alanis album...,"And i love it! It's really great. i've always liked alanis (especially with ""ironic"") but i never cared enough to buy any of her albums... but, i was in the store today, and i thought to myself: ""well, hands clean is tight, and alanis is fine, so... let's give her chance..."" and i bought it, wow, i'm glad i gave her that chance! Now, old fans will probably buy this album in no time, and new fans like me, buy this album! it's really great!!!All the 11 tracks here are great and all of them can be honored as ""singles"" and the best is... ah, they're all great!And, it's an enhanced c.d with a link to a secret website with many cool stuff! (a new song too!)Buy Buy Buy!!!"
3,Definitely different...,"I'm not sure I'd suggest this album for those who loved her previous albums but for hard core fans it has it's moments. She used to be my favorite artist until I got this album, it's just not full of her characteristic ""I hate the world and everyone in it"" attitude I fell in love with. If you're looking for something more positive an up beat, check this one out! If not, I'd listen to the samples above before spending your money. You never know, you may like it anyhow!"
2,"Alanis ""Under Rug Swept""","I used to like Alanis Morissette when I was younger (at the time ""Jagged Little Pill"" was released) but now her music just don't tells me nothing, both lyrical and musically. This last album only came to prove that. The songs are all similar in tone and rhythm, even Alanis voice arrangements starts to annoy the listener. When you reach track 5 you just can't stand no more of her kind of ""instrumentalized"" strident and boring voice. Sincerely, I am not anymore an Alanis Morissette music fan."
1,UNDER RUG SWEPT...good idea,"The best thing about this album is the cover! More useless songwriter babble from the most self-involved, self-indulgent performer on the planet. Alanis....take your money and retire. You take up space that some true artist rightfully should have."
2,well I gave it a chance,under rug swept was given positive feedback upon it's release and I was enjoying the song hands clean so I decided to check out the rest of the CD. Although alanis is a talented singer and songwriter I just wasn't feeling this CD although I give it to her for trying to be more musically diverse. It sounded too much like sugary pop to me I couldn't get into the rest of it.
1,this is when Alani's music started to get bad,"Even the first time I listened to this album I was hardly impressed. ""You Owe Me Nothing"" is the only song that sounded somewhat origonal and interesting. As for the rest of the album, it's either too pop, or too dull.Amazing, though, how the music videos, that were made to promote Under Rug Swept, were still original. Whereas with the release of Alanis's newest cd So Called Chaos, the videos are cheesey (judging by Alanis's music video for Everything)."
2,Shes not angry anymore...but still can't sing,"Bought this cd for my wife. Who admits that she fell in love with alanis after Jagged little pill (mainly due to the 'you oughta know' song).Alanis is a mediocre singer at best, nowhere near the voice of talented canadian singers like Diana Krall or Celine Dion. There are no songs on this cd which I would call a hit, no catchy melodies or memorable music. At least here two previous cds had at least 2 catchy tunes each, this one has none....Alanis seems to have attached like gangrene to the plight of angry women who have been hurt by cruel men. And those women are loyal and do not care if they can not sing along without a thesaurus. Therefore it is irrelevant what I write about this cd...."
4,CD Rom Issues?,"...Oh yeah, I give it four stars. I agree that she whines too much and I think that she needs to write lyrics about something other than relationships in the future. There are a few good songs on it though, like...3. Hands Clean4. Flinch5. So Unsexy6. Precious Illusions10. SurrenderingI like Alanis and I think she is an excellent song writer, but she needs to start writing about something else. Overall it is a pretty good cd and the more times I listen to it, the more I like it. It grows on ya."
4,Still got it,I love Alanis! She is one of my favorite songwriters and she definitely showcases this on her new album. Anyone who appreciates good songwriting should buy this album.
4,Wonderful 4th Album From Alanis,"Alanis Morissette's ""Under Rug Swept"" seems to have 3 parts to me. The first part, from ""21 Things..."" to ""Flinch"" is great. These first four songs are the best on the album, especially her single ""Hands Clean"". The second part, from ""So Unsexy"" to ""A Man"" are...pretty bad, actually. The sappy ballad ""That Particular Time"" does not seem like Alanis material. The last part, which is the last 3 songs, ends the album on the uptake. The song ""You Owe Me Nothing In Return"" sounds like an Alanis song, with its sarcasm-sweet lyrics and thumping, angry base line (courtesy of Me'shell Ndegeocello). The last song, ""Utopia"", (possibly written after September 11th)ends the album on a sweeter note. I don't think she will ever be able to top ""Jagged Little Pill"", but this one comes real close. Kudos to Alanis for a great 4th album!"
5,Alanis is finally calling the shots!,"I've never owned an Alanis Morissette CD until now! I bought it because of the irresistible first single ""Hands Clean,"" which is the best piece of work I've heard in a long time. From what I understand this is Alanis' first album that she wrote by herself and produced, a multi-talented person she is. From now on I'm going to start collecting her earlier work. There's not a bad song on here, one in particular I enjoy is ""Narcissus,"" I think the lyrics are downright funny and true simultaneously. How about ""Flinch?"" I never knew Alanis was blessed with such an amazing voice! That's the first time I ever heard her singing a ballad. ""21 Things I Want In A Lover"" is a good song too, a think she's a bit demanding, but oh well. Great guitar licks might I add! ""Utopia"" I think is absolutely beautiful! It sounds like a chorus of angels singing, very sentimental and optimistic. I think new and old fans alike will appreciate this record, especially new Alanis fans."
2,HANDS CLEAN and nothing more,"I've waited for so long for this album, but what I've gotten was a boring peace of work. only one really good song (hands clean), and a few nice songs (a man). this album was the beginning of the end for alanis."
4,"Once Again, Interesting","Alanis further explores her sentance lyrics on this album. She incorporates the electronic and rock together here, to create sort of a warm fuzzy of an album. She's not as...fantastical on this album. She's very direct, and while she's not angry, she's very cynical/sarcastic.""Narcissus"" is a great example of that direction. She chides people for being so self-absorbed that they don't realize how crap their lives are.""Hands Clean"" is a VERY good song concerning an underaged relationship. She tackles the subject with grace, and the music is compelling.Unfortunately, I don't remember a lot of this album. Those two songs alone deserve a 5 star rating, but the forgettability of the rest of the album drags it down to 4 stars.Respectable. Pick this one up. Maybe you'll like it more."
4,SIMPLE AND REAL!,"This third delivery by Morissette was a relief too the overcrowed ""Supposed""... this album is more down to earth and more free of pressure, produced by herself. The leading single ""Hands Clean"" although not the best of the album is very catchy and with very truthful lyrics, a well deserved return to the mainstream, the second and last single ""Precious Illutions"" it's a master piece of rock, good chorus line, good meaningful lyrics, great vocal arragement and stunning music, an A+, other tracks that stand as best ""Surrounding"" should have been single tune, great beginning and voice, ""So Unsexy"" haha great tune, ""Utopia"" sounds so intimate...this is a great third record sad that none of the other tracks got the attention to be out there available as radio airplay tracks, guess Britney didn't gave space to Alanis back 2001."
1,What a disappointment!,"I have read everything Stephen King has written and have always looked forward to what is going to be coming out next. I purchased the audiobook as it was the only way to experience it, even thought I would much prefer a novel. I thought at least it might be neat to hear his voice reading his words. I was so disappointed! The stories were very mediocre for King. I had trouble paying attention to them and I think his style of reading took away from the stories. I hope he has this out of his system! I hope these were old stories he had and decided to finally publish them, I would hate to think this is his latest work and this is what we have to look forward to from now on!"
1,It put me to sleep,"That's right, friends and neighbors - hearing the King read his own works zonked me right out. These stories may just work on the printed page, or perhaps with somebody else reading them - but certainly not Stephen King. His voice just drones, on and on, ad infinitum (almost ad nauseam) in a monotone that only slightly varies when his characters get a tad emotional.It really pains me to have to say this, because I've loved everything King has ever written (except the Dark Tower series, which makes absolutely no sense at all) - but he's a much better writer than a reader. Note that I say ""reader"", not ""speaker"". I've heard him speak, both off the cuff and in a lecture, and he's much more emotional and emphatic in those modes. Please, Stephen, put these stories out in a book, or get someone else to read them. The blurb on the case that says ""read by the author"" is a nice gimmick, but that's all it is - a gimmick."
2,Very disappointing.,"I recently went camping with some friends and, after reading all of the wonderful reviews of Blood and Smoke, decided to buy it for the trip. What a disappointment! Six people sat in the dark, next to a small campfire, under the stars, out in the middle of the woods, and were not scared IN THE LEAST! Save your money for The Stand."
4,"Stories are good, but . . .",Blood and Smoke is an audio collection of three Stephen King short stories. All three are great. Lunch at the Gotham Cafe concerns the events than transpire when a divorcing couple meet at a restaurant where the Maitre'D isn't quite dealing with a full deck. It's a good but not great story. The Deathroom is a claustrophobic and probably improbable tale of a journalist taken in for questioning by a third world government. 1408 is the real prize on this collection -- a chilling tale of a haunted hotel room that cost me several hours of sleep.BUT. But. All three stories are now available in written form in the collection Everything's Eventual. You do not have to buy this audio tape if you plan to buy that book -- that is unless you have a yen to hear King read his stories (and do a fairly good job of it).
4,Very interesting stories,"All these stories were quite interesting and entertaining to listen to. I give 4 stars out of five on all of them. The best had to be the second one, the 1408 story, it's the only one that even came close to a 5 on my list. The third one, the death room, was also quite good but the main characters escape after getting out of the room was a little too easy. The first story was good but probably the worst. It had a lot of potential and I found some parts even funny, but it was really too far fetched and it didn't really make any sense, it was too UN-logical. In this piece of work, Blood and Smoke, Stephen King's great writing skills are UN-deniable but I can't help but think that all the stories could have been alot better if he would have put some more work into them. I would really love to see some kind of sequel to Lunch At the Gotham Cafe(The first story) It was quite interesting and I'm eager to see what happens next."
1,Stephen King is not a PROFESSIONAL reader...,"I stopped listening after 5 minutes. His voice sounds so fake, that I could actually ""see"" him read. They should have gotten a professional to read this. Stephen King should stick to writing books, not reading them!"
2,Yuck! Yuk? Ugh!....,"Much as I enjoy Stephen King, I can't wax poetic on this one; loved the stories; hated the graphic gore and details..."
3,Good not Great,"I would recommend this book to any hardcore King fans or for those that don't like to read long books. His best work has always been his longer novels (i.e. The Stand, IT, Talisman, etc.) because he is so great at developing his characters. This simply can't be done in such a short period of time. Each of these three stories are around an hour in length and carry a small theme of smoking. The best part is that King is the one reading these and his use of voices is excellent, especially in ""In the Deathroom."" ""1408"" which is about a haunted room is probably the best story and has some grotesque scenes. This isn't as good as some of his other short stories like Night Shift but I did still enjoy it."
5,great Tape.,I got this tape for christmas and I loved it. The only downside it that I thought the tape was short.
4,STILL GOT IT!,"After the touching disappointment,Bag of Bones, he's back to scare. Though this collection is not is no Night Shift, It's good. The first, Lunch at the Gothame Cafe, is a humorous but scary look at a failed marriage and psychotic waiter handling too much stress. The second, I can't remember the name, but it is a cool ghost story about a room that doesn't have a pleasing effect on it's occupants. The last is the let down. In the Death Room is a bad spy/torture tale."
2,For the love of god Think TWICE BEFORE BUYING THIS!,Summary: Horribly Nasal voice! No pauses or individual tracks (so if you take the CD out prepare to fast forward through 15-45 minutes of audio) Lackluster stories with an emphasis on smoking..
5,1408,"There is no doubt that Stephen King is a master of horror, and to hear him read his tales is more than satisfying. But the reason every King fan should own this audiobook is for the truly terrifying reading of what is possibly King's scariest short: ""1408.""I'm a seasoned King reader (I've read everything he's written except the ""Dark Tower"" series). When I read ""1408,"" I spent fifteen minutes scaring into space and collecting my wits. When I listened to King read it, I shook in my bed. King's controlled voice bends and shifts as he rasps the terrifying words that come from the telephone, as he methodically describes the wrongness of the room. It is a masterpiece.Buy this. Just don't listen to it in the dark."
4,Blood and smoke,I thought it was a paperback. It was a cassette tape I have not had a chance to listen to it. I am sure it will be worth wait. Stephen king never disappoints. I will look more carefully at the options before I order again. It came 3 days before it was scheduled to.
5,A rare eighties gem,"GTR 1986. featuring Phil Spalding, Steve Hackett, Jonathan Mover, Steve Howe, and Max Bacon.GTR came together following Steve Howe's leaving from Asia (1985). Teaming up with Steve Hackett of ""Genesis"" Adding Bass guitarist Phil Spalding and drummer Jonathan Mover and finally gaining strong vocal talent from singer Max Bacon.GTR released one self-titled album (Arista Records November 1986). This gold album had two fairly big hits""When the Heart Rules the Mind"" hit #14 and ""The Hunter"" which topped at #85. The album as a whole hit #11 on the charts. That was about it as the band slowly crumbled after a North American and Europian tour.This album is now in cd form only as an import and runs a few bucks. I truly believe it to be worth every dime. It has a definite eighties sound to it but, as that this was prime of life time for these great talents, it is a must have for anyone familiar with the groups they all came from."
3,Transitional Milton,Listen....this is not a 5 star album. Please. It's a transitional album that merely hints at the greatness to come. A worthy purchase nonetheless for fans of Milton's peak period.
3,A good workout,This video has a good pilates style workout that incorporates the pole. Unfortunately the pole tricks are ran through really quickly with very little instruction.
3,Its ok,I prefer a faster pace to keep me interested and the work outs and warms ups were boring to me. They are very similar to ones I did in dance classes and ones I have done on other exercise videos but the way they were done just bored me. The pole work was more interesting but I still found this hard to keep my attention. Nothing really made me feel excited to try what they were doing. So this is practical but not fun.
3,I could take it or leave it....,"The pole portion of this video is nothing special. The beginning work out/warm up is actually better than the pole tricks in my opinion. I am currently enrolled in two different programs that teach pole dancing and I've had other videos to compare this to. The pole tricks are not really broken down or explained, and they are done quickly and sort of carelessly. I wasn't blown away by Dr. Amy's pole dancing either, she kind of bored me. When I see a pole dancer doing a routine I want it to look effortless otherwise why would I want to learn to do it? Save your money for a better video, this one is definitely over rated."
4,An Interesting Collaboration,"This is an album by a group consisting of the New Zealander (Aussie?) Mike Nock on piano, Bennie Maupin on reeds, Cecil McBee on bass and drummer Eddie Marshall. The original recording date on my vinyl copy says 1967. This is what was called 'loft jazz' a little on the avant garde side. I guess you can liken this work to that of Andrew Hill. Anyway, Nock is a formidable piano player and he more than holds his own with his American bandmates. And the sidemen do shine. Bennie Maupin plays tenor sax on some selections and flute other times. His work on ""Symbiosis"" fortells his contributions to the ""Head Hunters"" album. McBee is great, his deep, rich tones are captured well. Marshall ably propels the group through these mostly modal sounds."
2,Queen of the Amazons,"The characters were interesting; the plot itself was well done, however the concept that bothered me greatly about this book was the fact that the ""queen"" was actually a male soul in the body of a female! It defeats the purpose of an female warrior race, when that race is led by a queen that was an infamous male warrior in his previous body!"
1,"Seek out a copy of ""Lord Of The Two Lands"" instead!","When I heard that Judith Tarr was writing another book involving Alexander the Great, I eagerly awaited its publication. Instead I found it a huge disappointment!! I enjoyed much of her first book about Alexander, ""Lord Of The Two Lands"", but her latest book is a sorry conclusion to her Alexander story. Her writing style comes across as forced and awkward, and the surprise twist that occurs two/thirds of the way through just made me groan and want to throw the book to the side. (Even though I saw that 'surprise' coming after the first few chapters, I had hoped I would be wrong and it would turn out to be a TRUE surprise, but no such luck!). I found this to be a ridiculous attempt at Alexander fiction, and such a great historical figure deserves better than to be such an insignificant character and no more than a goofy plot device. Skip this one and seek out her first Alexander novel for a much better read."
2,Hints of darkness to come,"It was good at first, but then it all started to go downhill at some point. I don't know HOW Gwen manages to say and do the wrong thing in love so often. One would think that you would get tired of putting your foot in your mouth at some point. Or maybe, rather, your body in the wrong arms. She also professes at different points in the novel how she loved X, but Y had this special something that she craved...and then how Y was her love, but Z was this addiction that she couldn't shake...and etc ad infinitum. It was about this time that I started wondering about if she truly had the ability to love truly."
3,Fun.,"Definitely an entertaining movie, albiet a bit slow. We get to hear a song from Dean Martin and one from Sammy Davis Jr. which is a real treat. Unfortunately- no singing from Sinatra in this one. Good plot, worthy of a modernized version. Very dissappointing ending."
2,Two stars is a gift,"The GOOD:- Some nice historical shots of Las Vegas during its golden age- Sammy's musical / dance numberThe BAD:- Comes across as just a pure star ego project (which apparently it was)- Silly dialog- Lots of non-value added characters (remember this was a full employment project for Frank's buddies)BOTTOM LINE:The folks giving this movie 4-5 stars have definitely drunk the nostalgic Rat Pack cool aid. I honestly think they are reviewing the idea of this movie, rather than the film itself. If you not one of these fans, then I would recommend- Wait for the original to appear on late night TV- Get the ""remake"" - much better"
3,Better the Second Time 'Round,"Usually when movies are re-makes they can't match up to the greatness of the first. In this case, the re-make of Ocean's 11 was better than the original. The original Ocean's 11 was slow and not nearly as dramatic. It lacked the technical info. that helped to make Ocean's 11 with George Clooney et al really great. Granted, technology during the Rat Pack's day was no where near the technology of today but the original Ocean's 11 lacked technology that would have been current at that time."
2,Eh.,"I was dissappointed in the original Ocean's 11. I expected much more. There were brilliant moments. The ending was one of them -- but it was a lot to sit through to get there. Sinatra and Martin were dry, and Sammy Davis, Jr. was way under-utilized. Peter Lawford was excellent as the rich kid, and I think gave the strongest performance. I enjoyed Cesaer Romero as well.I much preferred the remake of this movie."
2,Vegas Time Capsule,"""Ocean's 11"" (1960) has survived as a cult favorite among Rat Pack aficionados. The film also represents a time capsule of a Las Vegas that no longer exists, as evidenced by the destruction of the Sands in 1996. Unfortunately, there is little else that remains memorable, except for the famous ""twist"" ending and some amusing cameos by Red Skelton, George Raft and Shirley MacLaine. Director Lewis Milestone was better off filming the Rat Pack's ""Summit"" performances, which had more energy and spontaneity. For a ""caper"" film, ""Ocean's 11"" moves at a lethargic pace - bogged down by too many secondary characters and subplots. Amazingly, the heist is not introduced until the halfway mark. In terms of Rat Pack portrayals, Dean Martin and Sammy Davis Jr. come off best, with Frank Sinatra displaying little enthusiasm for the material. A potentially good film was buried in ""Ocean's 11,"" which director Steven Soderbergh unearthed with his 2001 remake."
3,Cool Cast but not Rock Solid Film,the Cast is cooler than the film on a whole.finally saw it this past weekend.I enjoyed the Cast&there cool Vibe but the Film was more a Showcase of Coolness than any overall Film Substance.Sinatra is cool here but He has had far better overall Performances.the Rat Pack though have Pressence&that alone makes any film with them all in it worth a peak at least.
4,great,an excellent movie that has action and a little bit of comedy also great stars such as sammy davis jr. dean martin and of course frank sinatra
4,In memory of Frankie,"The great Lewis Milestone, the supreme filmmaker of the well reminded "" All quite on the Western front"" undertook this fanciful and dynamic heist on form of comedy around to rob five casinos simultaneously. The Rat pack in action is plenty enough to maintain us in constant vigil from start to finish."
4,"Good Movie, Good Transfer","This is a good movie and the DVD transfer is good. Nothing great. Nowhere in the same league as ""Reservoir Dogs"" or even ""Pulp Fiction"" (slightly different genre), in terms of story, soundtrack or transfer."
2,Kind of a Disappointment,"After seeing the new Ocean's trilogy I wanted to see the film that inspired it all. It was a bit of a disappointment.While it was fun to see the Rat Pack, the only members I recognized and could keep track of during the film were Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Peter Lawford, and Sammy Davis Jr. The other members of the team were basically a blur. Compared to modern films this one is very slow-moving and took a long long time just to get started.Dean Martin and Sammy Davis Jr were about the only actors who stood out, not least for their singing. Though the short scene with a very young Shirley MacLaine was a highpoint.While it was interesting to see the Rat Pack in action, probably the best thing about the original Ocean's 11 was the surprise ending (and even that was a bit predictable)."
1,Trying to order it for school.,"Went and tried to buy the whole movie, and I got a message stating that the video will be in my library if and when my order process. I have to watch this video for my final assignment in my History of Money class."
5,SINATRA IS MAH-VAH-LESS!!,"This 1960 classic is just that: A CLASSIC!! It is a 'Rat Pack Bonanza!' The boys, plus six others, are planning to knock off five Vegas casinos on New Year's Eve, but guess what? The plan goes awry!! So...what else is new??!! They're all here...just for our viewing enjoyment: Sinatra, Martin, Davis, Lawford, Bishop...plus Dickinson, Conte, Romero, Tamiroff, Silva, Lester, Fell...plus Skelton, MacLaine, and Raft!! If that ain't a bonanza, I don't know what is!! If you somehow missed this little gem, pick up a copy here at AMAZON.COM. Throw a few logs on the fire, sip some Jack Daniel's, sit back...and enjoy!! P.S. This is one of Sinatra's best film performances...EVER. Clooney doesn't even come close!!"
4,Widows and Orphans,"What a thoroughly enjoyable movie.The team, the attitude, the colorful sets, the caper.This is a fun caper story that does not take itselftoo seriously, but rather just enough.You've get a heapin' helpin' of some of the biggestentertainers of their time, perhaps the biggest.You've got a time-capsule representation of Las Vegas.You've got a score written and conducted by Nelson Riddle.You've got an excellent ending.It all adds up to a guarenteed good time at the movies.""What's wrong with a little hey-hey?""In this case, nothin' Franky."
5,ring-a-ding-ding baby here comes the rat pack,"if all you have ever seen is the remake of ocean's 11 then you really haven't seen one of the best comedy caper movies of the 60's. frank , dean , sammy ,peter , joey , and many more are on hand to rob 5 casinos in one very big new years eve job. with this cast plot shouldn't matter but the plot is sound and you can tell the boys are having fun. turn your brain off and let the rat pack show you what cool was really about in the 60's"
1,stinker,"Before seeing Soderbergh's remake I thought it would be a good thing to watch the originial. It stank. No-one (save two of the girls: Angie & Shirley) could be bothered to give a performance, no-one could be bothered to direct. It looked like the laziest piece of filmmaking I've seen since Bridget Jones's Diary. The excuse there was a first time director who was unable to display ANY knowledge of filmmaking; with Ocean's 11 there is no excuse - its director had made All Quiet on the Western Front! It has ONE good shot (and Bridget had at least three - but then give a chimp a typewriter and it might come up with SOME words correctly spelt. ) The good shot? The end, the one Soderbergh repeats before his own (superior) end.I give it one star because you don't invite fewer."
1,Don't let 'em scam you,"This movie might be preferable to rubbing beach sand in your eyes, but not by much."
3,GLOSSED OVER,"This book is interesting and fun reading for all Chamberlain fans, but it simply glosses over the surface of the life of an enigmatic and complex actor. There is really nothing in-depth here, which, I suppose, is exactly how Chamberlain wants it."
1,Faux Intellectualism,"As a student of politics and French philosophy, I appreciate subtle humor, intellectual irony, and the quirky erudite comment. But this book, which is marketed as the ""thinking person's"" humor book, was utterly disappointing. I don't know who Mr. Martin is trying to entertain, but I couldn't think of anyone I know who would enjoy such ""drivel"". That's why my copy hit the trash."
1,"Typically disappointing, Martin shows he's a one gag man.","While hardly cerebral, Steve Martin has an all around funniness that translates pretty well to stand up acts and motion pictures. As in much of his writing however, 'Pure Drivel' fails to amuse or provoke anything special. Martin is an intelligent man and I suspect has been producing work below his own standard for much of his career; in this sense 'Drivel' represents a pinnacle of sorts. Take a leaf out of this reader's book by taking all the leaves out of his - try 'The Bounting Man' by Helmut Fickenwirth or Roy Williamson's 'Mr. King'. These works are funny, thought provoking and more worthy of print than a slapstick comic's tired ramblings."
4,Much better than Cruel Shoes,"It seems like the previous reviews have been fairly polarized. The fans of Father of the Bride don't get it and the people who understand wit do. I like to think of myself in the latter category. ""Times Roman Font Announces Shortage of Periods,"" is just about the most clever thing I have read the whole year of 1998. I love how Mr. Martin just obsessess every stupid thing he hears in his life. For instance, ""In Search of the Wily Filipino"" is an hilarious rant motivated by a simple stupid throwaway comment Marlon Brando made in his infamous Larry King interview. A couple of the pieces are disappointments, but then there would be a good piece coming up right afterwards. Let's hope Steve will write another one of these before making Father of the Bride III."
3,"steve, you kick a**","steve martin ,ever the comedic, ironic genius. you are always challenging, even if you disturb me with the channels my humor may follow along with yours. Sincerely , Antig"
2,I would have to forgo novelette and use novel-lite.,"While presenting an amusing set of ancedotes (most in the Nicholas Baker rather than predected Steve Martin vein), there just does not seem to be enough here to justify a book. If these short collections could have been wrapped in an insight into the author (which there is not any of), then they may have come across as a body of work large enough to stand alone by that illustrious title ""book""."
4,I just giggled and giggled.,"I knew this book would be funny, as Steve Martin never disappoints. Well, it's true. The little 'stories' are nice and short, so it's perfect to read before bed. Recently I came across my copy again, so I started to page through it and ended up reading the entire thing again. Also, this is probably the only book in our entire house that my husband hasn't suggested that we donate or sell. That says it all. :p"
4,Steve Martin at his funniest.,"The book was fun to read, and the CD version of Steve Martin reading the book was absolutely wonderful.I imagine that it might have been a good season for Martin because I received the book as a birthday present in November and got the CD for Christmas, when by coincidence I gave the tape and two books as presents to three different people. Five other friends and I also attended ""Picasso at the Lapin Agile"" on closing night (Labor Day weekend) last year in San Francisco. I think my friends, family, and I have contributed nicely to Martin's finances in the past six months, but it was money well-spent."
3,"Entertaining, satirical short stories by humorist Martin",This book is a collection of satirical short stories by Steve Martin. They look at the pretensiousness of modern life through the cracked prism of Martin's sensibility.
5,Love it or hate it,"Boy, this book gets either 1 or 5 from people. This book is hilarious if you are smart (i.e., not IQ 131 or below and ""slow on the uptake""). Get this book. The chapter on memory problems over 50 is worth the price alone."
3,It really was Pure Drivel!,"Though this book had some extremely funny bits in it, I think it could use some work. Steve Martin's stories were awkward and some just didn't make any sense. A good example of that is the chapter 'Taping My Friends'. I can see why they call this book Pure Drivel!!!"
4,Funny Man writes Funny Book,Steve Martin's book proves that he is as funny with the written word as he is on stage and screen. I found his insites to be witty and very funny. Steve Martin's humor reminds me of the humor of Vladimir Kek in Mafia Lesbian. If you like Martin you'll like Kek. If you like Kek you'll like Martin
4,"If you don't think it's funny, you're probably shallow.","I heard about the book on the radio, went to buy it but I noticed it was $20. I thought, ""Twenty dollars for this little rectangle of paper, never!"" Then I went home and started to think about it.... Steve Martin's the coolest, most stylish, classiest guy out there. So I went back to the store and paid the $20. Honestly? One of the best $20 I ever spent. Steve's wit shines through the entire book, an outloud laugh on every page. I'll admitt, some of it took some thinking, but in the end I was laughing... Buy this book. That's all there is to it, buy this friggin' book."
1,"Steve, come back, wherever you are!","Steve, you've been my Comedy God since I saw your stand-up routine live in the 70's. But this ""book"" is literally a lightweight that doesn't do justice to your considerable talents. Want to read funny, try ""Naked Pictures of Famous People"" or even ""In The Bin""-a hockey book for god's sake-but pass on this paltry effort"
5,FUNNY,"All I have to say about this book is that it has no main plot, but that doesn't matter when you compare it to the humor in the book. It's easy to read, and is funny the whole way through. I garentee that you will not be disapointed."
1,The title is accurate.....,"Not funny, and indeed, pure drivel. I love Steve Martin's comedy, but this just wasn't good at all. I threw the CD away after one playing."
1,Pure Drivel,"I will go to any movie with Steve Martin in it, but I'll never again read a book by him. This is a weak book, the drivel is very rarely funny, and this is a shadow of the Steve Martin humor."
1,A very unfunny book.,It was the worst book I have read that was written by a comedy actor. The only good part was about the Mensa IQs. I promptly put it in my donation pile not in my bookcase
4,Intelligent Laughs,"""Pure Drivel"" is Pure Fun. Smart, witty, intelligent, intellectual, this is the type of humor so prevalent in his New Yorker Magazine essays. Though some of the essays I just didn't get, the rest of the book is a refreshing brand of humor, one that stands out from the current vulgar common fare. A great read indeed!"
3,Easy to read in short amounts of time.,Steve Martin's Pure Drivel gives the busy person a little humor in short periods of time. His ability to make people laugh on stage carries over into the pages of this humorous and short book. I enjoyed Steve Martin's look at the little things in life. He sees things in a different light and shares them with the reader. You can laugh outloud when reading this book alone or use it as a short story before bedtime. I recommend this book to the rushed reader.
2,Save your money,"This book has its moments, but they're too few and far between. If an unknown writer had submitted these humorous essays for publication, all but two or three would have been rejected."
2,Lives up to its name,"I guess I must be a reformed Steve Martin fan. I used to think he was bust-me-up, fall on the floor funny, but while listening to this tape I hardly laughed. Some of the bits are very funny, but not enough to make it worth the money. Overall, I was disappointed."
5,a real drain on productivity,"I don't know how many hours I cost my company, as I distracted my co-workers with my shrieks of laughter as I read ""A Public Apology"", ""Dear Amanda"", and ""Writing Is Easy"" during my lunch hours.The book is a scream, and is worth your while (if you HAVE a sense of humor, that is)."
2,"Unfortunately, the title isn't ironic.","While I did laugh out loud a few times, most of the book was a letdown. I wonder if it would even have a chance at publication if the author wasn't well known."
3,Witty musings from a talented writer.,"Mr. Martin's book, Pure Drivel, is full of clever writing. It is, however, not much more than that. Reminiscent of Vonnegut's book of short stories, Welcome to the Monkey House, I expected it to leave me with the same feeling of thoughtful pleasure and somewhat breathless awe of Mr. Martin's skillful manipulations of the language. It didn't. Pure Drivel seems to be a collection of bits and pieces, the mere warm-up exercises of a writer. While it is encouraging for me as a budding writer to see that even such doodles of language can be published and sold, this book does not do the author justice. It was interesting to see what a writer that I admire does in his spare time, but I don't think that it was worth paying for it. Afterall, I don't think that my literary doodles will ever find such notoriety. I have to save up for my own career!:)nikki"
1,Pure Drivel Indeed!,"I love Steve Martin, particularly his wonderful comedy albums like ""Let's Get Small,"" and others, all of which are now available on CD. Get them, not this fluffy book that's only remarkable characteristic is that it has no misspellings. This lightweight book is overpriced for its 104 pages, and is so far from the bathos and substance that Martin had in his early years. In a recent interview on Charlie Rose, Martin said this book is the real him. I think not, and hope not. The comic genius he once was has become anesthetized in this book, and I hope one day to see it reawaken. Fame may have been the worst thing that has happened to Steve Martin. He is a fine comic actor, but he has delusions of adequacy if he thinks he can cut is as a comic essayist. Is success the reason he now turns out these inert books? Perhaps. We miss you, Steve!"
1,Title accurate,I purchased this item because I saw a clip of one story in the book. That clip was the only worthwhile portion of the book. The title of the book is extremely accurate. Just proves a celebrity can get anything publised. I wonder if he had to pay to have it published?
2,Witty but disappointing,"The title reflected the content all too accurately; pure drivel in a stream of conciousness. While Steve Martin's selected writing samples are humorous at times, the book was not quite what I expected from the author.While I respect Martin as an accomplished perfromer and writer, I found this small hardcover barely worth the cover price and effort it read it.It is my opinion that Martin remains one of the wittiest minds in the comedy world today, artfully mixing his background in philosophy and improvisation when performing. But, to my disappointment, the book lacked something crucial."
1,Lives up to it's title,"A completely humorless waste of time. I can't remember the last time I was so disappointed in a book. There are certainly some chuckles, but not enough to justify the time or money invested."
3,Nothing Special,"Got this book in the audiobook form. The book is composed of a number of brief, humorous essays. The first few essays had me laughing, and at first I was really having some fun with this book. The vignette full of ""Dear Amanda"" letters, from heart-broken Joey was hilarious, as was the opening list of Mr. Martin's ""public apologies"". However, the book quickly sank into a bunch of rather long, tedious, boring essays. I was so disappointed in the end. I ended up quitting after the first of the two included CDs in the audiobook. Oh well."
5,pure drivel is purely divine,"i discovered this book while working at a public library. i found it on the audiobook aisle and gave it a listen. and believe me, if you haven't listened to the audiobook i encourage it. it's completely different hearing martin's voice. i can't imagine not listening to the audiobook and enjoying the written one, in fact.the book is a series of dry-humoured short stories, all sure to make one smirk. ""times new roman announces shortage of fonts"" is surely the best one, though ""taping my friends"" runs a close second.in my opinion, this is by far the best of martin's books. it's good for airplanes, car rides, or any time you want a short read. give it a read (and a listen!)"
5,WARNING: This audiobook is brilliant.,"WARNING:You may not want to listen to it while driving, due to the danger of prolonged laughter causing you to pass out. You may not want to quote this book, due to the danger that you will want to continuing speaking brilliantly, until you find you have infact recited the entire book.Once you begin listening, it almost too much. Every essay is brilliant. Every short story is sublime. When you are done, one is left in awe of America's foremost comic philosopher.Thank you Steve Martin, for writing this book."
1,A complete waste of time..,"Of the entire tape, the few humorous passages could have fit quite easily on a post-it note instead."
2,Title rings true for some of the stories,"I have read Steve Martins other books and throughly enjoyed them. In looking for a new book I came across this. After reading the reviews I was a bit hesitant about getting the book, but his others were good so this one can't be bad (right?). Well, I read about 3 of the stories and then skimmed over the rest. It is not that it was bad, just not entertaining. Nothing held my attention, I fouond my thoughts wandering midway thru his sentences. So, if you enjoyed his other books I would head to the library for this one."
3,The audio might have been better,"I am a great Steve Martin fan and looked forward to this book, which I just discovered the other day.He introduces the pieces in this book as ""little candy kisses, after-dinner mints to the big meal of literature"" which made me chuckle right away!I was laughing just reading the contents pages/essay titles at the beginning of the book: ""Mars Probe Finds Kittens"", ""Artist Lost to Zoloft"", ""How I Joined Mensa"", ""In Search of the Wily Filipino"".The first couple of stories were amusing and then I started skipping around and then I decided I was glad the book was so short.There is no doubt that Mr. Martin is a very clever, multi-faceted, multi-talented person. However, upon finishing this book, I decided that I would rather watch him perform than read his comedy. Perhaps I would have liked this better as an audio book."
1,it's insulting that anyone would consider publishing this,What a disappointment. I think Steve Martin is one of the funniest people alive and this was a ridiculous waste of money and time.
2,PURE DRIVEL? IT MUST BE A DISCLAIMER,"I went out and gave Steve Martin twenty bucks because I appreciated all the laughs the silly son of a motherless goat has given me over the past twenty years or so. But this book straight sucks a big one. I can't remember even cracking a smile during the hour and a half it took me to peruse this Woody Allen wannabe waste of a tree. Tell you what: give the video guy three bucks, get Planes, Trains, and Automobiles, and spend that hour and a half actually being entertained."
1,Very strange. Not funny.,"Sorry, just didn't get this book. Didn't laugh more than a couple of times in the first 50 pages, so then just skimmed the rest. Wasn't funny. Just unintelligible. Don't bother."
1,Steve Martin can keep you laughing for five lifetimes.,"Steve Martin is an original. His wit has kept me laughing for years before I actually met him. Now that I have met him, he's even funnier and more strange. I have never met anyone I could never relate to other than to love him."
3,"Yes, Drivel","I chuckled a few times, but it wasn't nearly as good as his other stuff. It was, aptly, Pure Drivel."
4,great read,Great if you like Steve Martin and you get his unique sense of humor. If you liked the movies LA Story and Roxanne you'll love this off-beat collection of short stories. Good stuff!
4,"Clever, hilarious & out of left field.","There are 23 mini stories in this mostly hilarious collection. Some of the essays I admit I didn't quite get (e.g the ones about the cats) but for the most part I was impressed. The stories I laughed hardest at (and I did laugh hard) were Dear Amanda, Changes In The Memory After 50, & Times Roman Font Announces Shortage Of Periods (Full Stops). I felt the second half wasn't quite as funny as the first half and it is very short but I'm sure I'll pick this up again in the future. If you like your humour a little quirky & absurd without resorting to being crass I believe you'll enjoy this."
5,Pure comedy.,"While not a book for the totally uneducated, PURE DRIVEL is intelligent comedy at its finest. The majority of the short pieces offered in this collection were created for THE NEW YORKER but anyone who can understand the language can enjoy the jokes. This isn't a print version of his classic standup (as so many books by comedians are) and the humor isn't the in-your-face slapstick stuff that so many deem necessary. Steve Martin is, and always has been, on another level.Another important point that this book gets across, although likely unintentionally, is that, even in today's market, funny does not have to equal explicit. Profanity isn't necessary for great comedy. This book won't make your grandmother blush due to constant F-bombs.If you didn't get past the ninth grade, this book isn't for you. Otherwise, it's a highly entertaining read."
5,Best Quark book found,"I searched for Quark books as I am taking a graphics degree and found the course books both years out of date and full of errors, tutors told me they were still the best available and looking in book stores and online I had to agree till I saw this tome and used it, excellent book of Quark and so very easy to follow."
2,I didn't want an apple taco...,"I generally love these Sunbelt products. They are tasty and healthy and that is a wonderful combination. Sadly, these bars have a distinct taste that is off-putting and really makes them less than wonderful in my eyes. The outer shell smells and tastes like a wheat tortilla. I'm not joking. The center is wonderfully apple like and the cinnamon flavor is apparent, but the initial taste one has when placing this in their mouth is not pleasant."
4,"good book, but dated","good book, but dated. It dates back to 2004 but it was very useful to me when my Mom's health started failing. It has good general info about talking with parents and with preparing"
5,got parents? get this book,"As we venture into this new and unknown territory - taking care to those whom we always depended on to take care of us - this is the first, second and only book you need. In a gentle and humorous way, Ms. Morris guides you through all of the aspects of this unknown road including the medical, legal, mental, physical, etc. Maybe my favorite chapter is the one in which Ms. Morris insists that you make sure of taking care of yourself first. I saw Ms. Morris on ""Oprah"" and bought the book for my ""first parent"". Now the book comes out ""bigger, better, and improved"" for my second parent. Strange to think that a book can be such a gift to our real lives. I can not recommend this book more strongly."
3,Too USA oriented info,"The book provides an encyclopedic overview of taking care of the elderly. There is not too much detail on many topics such as nutrition and colon care. Another problem is that much info is only of use to USA resident readers. I live in Spain which still has socialized medicine, so many addresses offered and legal issues discussed are irrelevant. Nevertheless, it does offer some consolation to us caretakers--which is nice, since few other people we meet are going to be so empathetic."
2,Not a lot of useful information,"This book is recommended on the Elderlawanswers site, which has a lot of good information, but I didn't find any information in the book that you can't get for free with an internet search or that isn't just common sense."
4,A good basic command of the B-24 and PB4Y.,"From the preface: ""As you read this volume, the history of the B-24 and PB4Y as machines will hopefully provide a glimpse into the lives of the men and women who built and crewed these aircraft."" Included in this edition: definition and evolution of the long-range, high capacity bomber, color photos and significant dates."
5,An Important Book,"This is more than a good book. It is an important book. The brilliant and insightful Thomas Friedman gives context to the rapid global changes that we are experiencing today. He presents a balanced and enlightened view of global markets, technology, information, the environment, cultural traditions and social issues, and how they all (can) fit together.After reading this book, you will read the newspaper with a new perspective and will approach business and cultural issues with added dimension. I highly recommend this book."
1,I'm trying...,"I've read about half of this book, and although I know I should finish it before I pass judgement, I'm not sure I'll be able to take another page of Friedman's smug tone, and constant analogies. Before I read this book I thought that analogies were a really good way to explain complex things so they are easily understood. Friedman goes too far! He over uses his analogies to the extent that you forget what the hell he was talking about in the first place. There's also something obnoxious about his tone. The title of the first chapter ""Tourist with an Attitue"" gives you a hint. This line, on page 86: ""So,idelologically speaking, there is no more mint chocolate chip, there is no more strawberry swirl,and there is no more lemon-lime. Today there is only free-market vanilla and North Korea."" really made me need a drink. I am consoled by the fact that this book will end . I hope I can stick with it."
2,"Too much ""Lexus""; Too little ""Olive Tree""","Something has happened to T. Friedman between writing ""From Beirut..."" and writing this book. In the past, he was an amazing journalist, with well-deserved awards. Now, I find something has infected him and I don't mean the internet or globalization. He has lost his independence. Not that this isn't an original book--it is. But it is also an establishment book that could only have been written by someone in the monied, elite class. Nothing wrong with that group except that they can't see from the Under side, so the opposite of Friedman's humanity in the past. He loses the human touch and hobnobs with too many heads of State and Heads of Corporations. Too bad that genius, which he possesses, necessarily goes astray in this society. He's influential to the same degree that he's lost some critical capacity. I recommend reading this book with above words in mind."
2,The world as america,I think that the book is well worthwhile to read but unfortunately is has to be taken with a huge grain of salt. I think that it is very narrowly focused and as an apology for globalism it is both too americanized and one sided. There is more than one (successful) culture in the world.
2,Arrogant and Naive,"This book displays the typical American arrogance and blatant disregard towards - and one-sided evaluation of - complex international issues. Go ahead and read this book, but absolutely complement this reading with Barnet and Cavanagh's balanced ""Global Dreams"" and Korten's scathing ""When Corporations Rule the World"" for a far more insightful and complete analysis of the issues."
2,"Good, but not as good as it could have been","Mr. Friedman presents a good overview of the process of globalization and for people who are trying to get a grasp of what that process is all about I would recommend this book. But I know the process is taking place and I know enough about what is driving it to want more than this book offers. I kept waiting for Mr. Friedman to reach conclusions about where the process is going and was constantly disappointed that none were forthcoming. Mr. Friedman's style is also heavily anecdotal, sometimes to the point of becoming a travelogue, and at points Mr. Friedman lets a certain arent-I-clever tone mar his writing. This book is the McDonald's version of globalization: quick, easy to digest, and nutritious enough to keep you alive to your next meal. Readers looking for a more in depth study should go elsewhere; a good introduction to the subject and little else."
5,Setting It Straight,"Its about time somebody actually explained the major benefits and drawbacks of globalization. Far too often these days people will voice their opinions about globalization without actually knowing what it is exactly. He does not irrationally defend globalization, he admits that people get left behind. Many who disagree with Mr. Friedman's central theses fail to see beyond their overly idealized notions of governance. It is a fantastic read and I could not put it down. His stories are entertaining and important to put globalizing ideas into a perspective that is easier to comprehend quickly. It is a must read if you really want to know what to expect in the future. Although unforseen events have challenged Mr. Friedman's predictions, it in no way discredits them. Brilliant book."
5,The Lexus and the Olive Tree,"Wonderful book! Provided a matrix to make sense of what you see and hear everyday, but can't quite put together in an organized manner. It has allowed me to read the newspaper and listen to the news with a new perspective and interest. Incredibly informative and helpful. Makes you feel you can get a better ""grip"" on what's going on in the world today. I can only thank him wholeheartedly."
1,Biased,"I read this book for an International Politics class. This book made me understand the pro-globalization perspective. It was very biased and anyone who does not understand globalization can easilly be persuaded by Mr. Freedman's statements. When I read ""Globalisation Unmasked"" By James Petras & Henry Veltmeyer, I got a different and more realistic picture of globalization."
3,Selective History,"Thomas Friedman is not at fault for preaching the wonders of globalization, after all, much of what he says is widely accepted as the truth regarding how economies work. Overall, this books is about the inherit, and almost magical and invisible good power of globalization.I took away only one lesson from this book, and that is the importance of education to maintain a competitive edge in the global economy. If a country wants to be competitive, it must have a well educated society, with skills and knowledge that can be ""sold"" to other countries.May I recommend Bad Samaritans by Ha-Joon Chang. A much more objective book on free trade and globalization."
1,Look elsewhere for interesting reading,"Obvious, folksy, self-involved, trite rehash of the current received wisdom of the 'global village' and the 'new economy'. A cynical attempt to (a) exploit this current ""globalisation"" bandwagon and (b) promote himself as a cool and well travelled guy Friedman. And regularly factually and/or conceptually incorrect. Real chicken-soup analysis. I'm upset with myself for having wasted money on this book. The pity is, when he sticks to journalism (e.g. Beirut-half of ""From Beirut To Jerusalem"") Friedman is a fine writer; it is when he tries his hand at commentary and analysis that it all comes horribly unglued."
3,A nice to have in traffic,A nice to have CD for my long commutes. I can only rate it center of mass as it didn't really say anything I didn't already know. But it did fill time and I did listen to it in its entirety.
1,Simplistic and trite,"Friedman rehashes cliches about globalization and the impacts of technological change. If you are interested in globalization, read Kaplan and Huntington -- they actually have something to say."
4,The Lexus and The Olive Tree Book Review,"What does a Lexus have to do with an Olive Tree? Friedman implies that the Lexus is the human drive to better oneself. Next, he implies that the Olive Tree is where we come from or our origins. Thus, through globalization, one can have their cake and...park their Lexus next to their Olive Tree. Friedman uses terms such as the aforementioned, combined with whit, to define the term globalization. For example, in Part II of the book, he uses the term DOSCapital to explain the government's various levels of control over capital. Friedman starts with DOSCapital 0.0 (communist operating system) and ends with DOSCapital 6.0 (the freest markets operating systems). Friedman's book is easy to read and understand for the average business student with an interest in globalization. Thus, I suggest that if globalization is a term that you wish to gain full knowledge of...read The Lexus and The Olive Tree."
2,Friedman is no Walter Lippmann,"Like it or not, Friedman is essentially right about two things: One, globalization is an enormously complex phenomenon. Two, this phenomenon is the axis of postmodern, postindustrial technological and economic theory today (though it's emerging at different rates around the world). Unfortunately that's about as profound as this ""interpretation"" becomes. Friedman's sophomore effort has a freshman ring to it. His writing is bracingly oversimplified in many areas (economic theory and culture studies to name two), he uses rather clumsy metaphor and analogy to make points that are largely intuitive, he oozes with bombast and tautology to drive his points home, with his sugar-coated exultations and incessant name-dropping all making for a quick, light read. Charming anecdotal bits, poor analysis, lackluster synthesis. Not a waste of time overall, but far from ""groundbreaking""."
3,"Today kids, let's talk about globalization.","This book is typical Friedman...easy to read, informative, and somewhat redundant. I think his columns in the NYT are must-reads, but his books are so thorough and understandable, they become slightly predictable after 250 pages. He piles so many enlightening little conversations into one book. Okay! So Moustafa in Cairo benefits from the Thai baht! We are all interconnected! Unless I'm a Euro-artiste, I understand and welcome this phenomenon: globalization.Mr. Friedman is an excellent writer, and perhaps he's essential to the great unwashed who mix their politics with their Ben Affleck. His works can be ingested during an afternoon at the beach (or, in my case, the prairie) and pooped out in a Saturday night conversation. A good read for anyone interested in the human race."
2,Way too many arrogant anecdotes,"An interesting book with some good ideas and some that I disagreed with, Friedman gets kind of irritating after a while. He uses so many different anecdotes to get his points across, that they become extremely irritating because it seems as though Friedman is just trying to prove how great he is by knowing so many different kinds of people in so many places. After about 100 pages you really don't want to hear about his orange example in Japan or wherever. He does make some good arguments against anti-globalization which are well worth thought, but overall not really worth reading. The book is just an extended editorial. Read his NYTimes editorials instead and maybe you won't get as annoyed."
3,Bird's eye view,"Very interesting perspective on the different currents shaping global society. Makes a good textbook for an introductory international business class as it is interesting and racy. However, it certainly needs to be supplemented with different view points and perspectives, including research. I recommend ""Multinational corporations in political environments: Ethics, values and strategies"" by U. Haley as a supplement to ""Lexus and the olive tree"" to obtain a more balanced understanding of globalization and diverse constituencies."
1,repetitive,"Repetitive, very little substance. Good book to give to someone older who you know feels out of touch with the ""fast"" world.....this book isn't so fast."
1,So simplistic...,"This book is so disarmingly simplistic, deterministic and so much imbued with american culture that one starts believing this to be intentional. Reality is much more complex than the author wants us to believe and development is not one-way: there are always options, but Friedman does not want to show them to us. Seattle, Jose Bove and the renewed emphasis on the tobin tax are there to prove it. Pretty a useless reading, not in touch with the daily life of 4/5 of the world population."
1,Discredited by recent events,"A lightweight discourse about ""the vw and the sugarcane"" -pretentious, pompous, ethnocentric, purely anecdotal, and woefully lacking in even rudimentary knowledge of the basic economics, worldview and culture of many of the regions he writes about. Sounds like a PBS special best left on the cutting room floor."
3,Brilliant but not Balanced,"I revere Tom Friedman, but not in this book. His ""take"" on the internet and globalization seems thin to this reader. He does come up with ingenius schemes, as is his wont, but they really don't fly here, don't capture the mulitude of realities about Either the internet Or Globalization. He's a genius, as most of us know, but he didn't dig deep enough in ""The Lexus and the Olive Tree"" to win me over. He's gotten too ""cute"" which belittles his many talents and his subject as well."
2,Day Dreams from A NY Skyscraper,"A starry eyed pep talk on the wonderful new world of the global economy-- free from any real experience of the depradations of the New World Order, Friedman chooses not to visit the maquilladora free trade zones, with their wrenching poverty and human exploitation. What Friedman replaces any critical analysis with is the sophistry, platitudes and blue sky fantasies of the neo liberal order, while every aspects of a democratic economy spins downward in the clutches and predations of his 'free' markets and information economy. See what sustenance an information sandwich or warmth a cyber dwelling has to provide the (increasingly numerous) victims of these ravages. Read Noam Chomsky's 'Profit over People' or Eammon Fingleton's 'In Praise of Hard Industries', to get a touch of reality of what is REALLY happening out there and the type of illusions, well represented in this book, that have to be overcome to fix it."
5,INMUN Secretary General recommends this easy to read explan,"Friedman characteristacally explains Globalism in a consise, easy to swallow format. He leaves few elements of Globalism unexplained, shows why the states of the earth are unable to resist or turn away from Globalism and still prosper, and he finally explains the possibility of a backlash against Globalism which is argueably the same which caused both world wars among others. A must read to see the true symbiosis of politics and economics."
3,Superficial understanding of global business,"The writer spins a good story, but I found the understanding of global business frothy. Rather than stories of Lexuses, as someone doing business in Asia, I found ""New Asian Emperors"" by Haley et al. a much more helpful, and even better written, book."
5,A place to start to learn about electronic globalization.,"Brilliant and well researched by Thomas Friedman who is well qualified to report on the subject. He has done the job of talking to many experts and then making his own conclusions or augmenting theirs in a way all readers can understand. Truly a book that helps one look into the window of the future without arrogance or hyperbole. I highly recommend the purchase of this book, you may find you will go back to it, again and again. It is refreshing that the caliber of Thomas Friedman actually lives up to the term Foreign Affairs Journalist, something lacking in other Washington News Readers and Reporters. Friedman actually thinks of good questions and then tries and find those who can answer them as well as give his own insight. The revelations of his premises leads to some sobering conclusions that many may not agree with, but are worth discussing in any event. Superb book without equal on the current lists of best sellers...Joe Janos"
5,An insightful and big picture-like book on current events,"The book provides a comprehensive framework to understanding how to interpret the many economic, social and political changes that the world has seen in the 1990's and will continue to see in the next decade and most probably beyond that. I will never look at a regional conflict, an economic crisis or a political upheaval the same way again. Mr. Friedman's book allows the reader to develop a thorough understanding and appreciation of the big picture as we all struggle to comprehend the ramifications of the fast changes spreading throughout the world, brought on by globlization."
5,A great book: I wish every member of Congress would read it!,"Tom Friedman's great talent is in making complex concepts understandable. He's really covered the waterfront in this book--not only the key aspects of what globalization is, but also what we need to do to be able to live with it. I think he's the best non-fiction author I've ever read (I loved from Beirut to Jerusalem too)."
4,The Lexus and the Olive Tree should be required reading.,"This book should be required reading for everyone in the world -- particularly in those nations that just don't ""get it."" Right on, Friedman. By reading your book, I felt like I got an M.B.A. Make sure your congressman gets a copy!"
4,An Interesting Book,"Very explicit and entertaining. It answers many questions about what ""globalization"" is, what's happening today, why it is happening and what people should do to survive the changes. It is important that the book can be read by anyone and does not require any special knowledge on the subject."
4,"Not Bad, for Thomas Friedman","I wasn't really expecting anything much from this book -- I mean, it was written by Thomas Friedman, after all. But I was surprised to find that there was indeed some nuance, subtlety, and depth in the book. It made me even think that there could be an explanation from Thomas Friedman's fame and influence, after all."
2,Waste of $$,"The author jumps happily on the globalization bandwagon. The overall impression is that globalization is inevitable, nicely mirroring the rhetoric of the ""free trade"" school of economics. Friedman seems to ignore historical precedents on global economics from Spain, Holland, and England, choosing instead to treat new technologies as ""world changing"".I also found the writing style a bit much to swallow. Mr. Friedman holds himself in quite high esteem. The self aggrandizement became nauseating after a couple of chapters."
3,Diatribe - Get in line!,"I'm afraid I had a hard time getting by the lecturing ""tone of voice"" that Friedman so often has in his speaking and writing. Despite the fact that there is a great deal of information in this timely book that will help clarify the trends in globalization, the didactic and often condescending language put me off and made it difficult for me to absorb the good information, experiences, examples, and messages.To make things even worse, I decided to get an audio version of the book to see if I was ""misreading"" the tone. Bad move! The impression I was receiving from the written word was amplified when I listened to Mr. Friedman read his own material. Still, if you can get by the tone and absorb the message, there is much to commend the book for those of us in the global business market. And, to hear Friedman tell it, economic leaders in the rest of the world had better listen up."
2,This is a pretty awful book,"Wow, what a waste of time. There were some good ideas in the book but they could have been easily written in a 10 page essay with no loss of depth. This guy should stick to writing for his newspaper."
1,Author is not very smart,After reading this book you will realize this guy doesnt know what he is talking about. Very close minded and not open to any changes. At the end you will be like whatever.
3,"Yes, Mr. Friedman's use of Enron is most unfortunate","Just an echo to bcramer's comment. I bought this book last year,found it very readable and providing very much food for thought.However, yes. Friedman's frequent and, as it turns out, unfortunate use of Enron and its officers as models of a corporate adaption to the global economy now cast doubt on the validity of his authority.One would think, given the prominence of Enron in the newsand the frequency of Friedman's NY Times columns and New Hour appearances that he would feel obliged to devote at least a column to the coporation that he has held up as a model.But a Google search of ""Thomas Friedman"" and ""Enron"" turns up no direct comment from Mr. Friedman on Enron, at least for thepast two months. Almost as if he never heard of it."
3,Waste of trees!,"My primary problem with this book is that Friedman takes about 500 pages to say what could be said in 200. He repeats the same points over and over again and has, at times, a homogenious writing style that can be incredibly annyoying! Some editor was sleeping on the job for this one. In addition, the book seems to have a pro-globalization orientation and is full of personal anecdote - fine if you are looking to rationalize gloablization, but not if what you seek is a well-researched, balanced outlook. Outside of these two criticisms, the book is an ""okay"" intro to globalization and any techie, in particular, will enjoy the read as about 75 percent of the book covers history of computers and the Internet (as it relates to globalization). If you buy, prepare yourself for an excessively long read."
2,"Great anecdotes, but otherwise not compelling","I made it about halfway through ""The Lexus and the Olive Tree"" before I started skimming for anecdotes. Why? Because Friedman follows the same formula in chapter after chapter. In each, he creates an artificial construct, then attempts to bend world events into his ill-fitted molds. He fails.The first few chapters of this book are quite interesting. Friedman is obviously well-traveled, and has gathered an impressive set of stories with which to illustrate his points. But he soon goes astray, concocting such nonsense as his ""Golden Straitjacket"", ""Electronic Herd"" and ""DOScapital"", battering the reader with them until the book becomes unreadable. Without the gimmicks, I might have read it end-to-end. I'm glad to say I borrowed instead of bought."
1,An overblown selfcongulatory waste of time,"Tom Friedman is a thoughtful and insightful writer on many fronts--but not in this book. He offers a ""blinding glimpse of the obvious"". But it's no glimpse. It's a torrent of self-indulgent words and more words and more words. This could have been a tight five to seven page essay. But no book. ""Common, Tom!!""--as he would say in his theatrical voice in this book..."
3,A good thesis poorly presented.,"Friedman has an excellent thesis but the overall presentation is weak. True to his style, Friedman relies on anecdotes as evidence. It's not just that the anecdotes do not offer real support for his main thesis, they detract from his argument because many of them show his ignorance of the particular political, cultural, or economic situation he is analyzing. Finally, Friedman creates an annoying abundance of cutsie names and phrases for various observed phenomena that bolster what the reader becomes suspect of. Namely, his faultingly superficial understanding of the geo-politics outside of the the Middle East, his real area of expertise.I would only mildly recommend this book. However, I did find it a good book for a book club, as it lead to very interesting discussions."
1,It's not so great,"Thomas Friedman, believe it or not, HAS A LEXUS AND NAMED THE BOOK THUS TO AID TOYOTA. I know this because I talked with the guy who sold him the car. Friedman uses nonsensical, non-factual, FICTIONAL dialogues in this book and it's all to tell you about something ""inevitable"" and doesnt give you the tools to DEAL WITH IT! Good golly, as incomplete a book as I've ever seen. Dont buy it. Dont read it."
4,Informative,"Thomas Friedman has done us all a favor taking on the subject of globalization and attempting to explain it to us. As a whole he did a good job however it did go on at length at times after the subject had been explained. This could well be one of those books that would have made a outstanding article in The Atlantic, but was stretched to fill the space of a book. It is an important subject however and don't shy away from spending the time with this book."
2,Globilization is not really new,"What do you really learn here?When I was in graduate school 25 years ago multinational corporations like ITT led by Harold Geneen were the concept; today we call that concept, globalization. But what is new? Sure, free trade may have accelerated due to the end of communism and the rise of the Internet but the concept is still the same old one. It seems to me the book is an extremely muddled book about free trade...."
2,Formulaic and Biased,"Friedman's book is shamefully US-centric for a book on globalization (although it tries very hard not to be). His journalist background becomes painfully obvious throughout. That wouldn't be such a bad thing if the book wasn't such a long, confused, and repetitive ""study"" of globalization. If you enjoy reading about (INSERT US CORPORATION) amazingly have an office in (INSERT COUNTRY HERE), yet co-existing with (INSERT LOCAL TRADITION/FOOD/ETC.), and enjoy reading it (INSERT LARGE NUMBER) times in the span of one book, then by all means buy this book. Personally, I find Mad Libs more enjoyable than this book is insightful. But maybe that's just me.One thing that I did find interesting was Friedman's ""McDonalds"" war theory.Also humorous in retrospect was the superiority of the US market/capital system, stemming from its ""financial transparency""."
1,Mixed reviews,"I initially found this book pretty interesting. I watched Thomas Friedman's interview on Charlie Rose and found him to be an interesting speaker on timely issues related to globalization.When I got the book and started reading it, I got pretty tired of reading the made-up terms he used, eg. electronic herd etc..I found the book to be biased towards the benefits of globalization and dismissing the disadvantages.What I did like about the book was some of the personal anecdotes he relates to the readers, ultimately giving you the feel that you're hearing the story from the man on the ground.I found doomsdayer520's review of this book to be particularly helpful."
2,Extra! Extra!,"Friedman spins one contrived anecdote after another in an attempt to illustrate a string of mangled analogies. While the subject of the book is vitally interesting, nuggets of content and glimmers of insight are few and far between. The author draws heavily on gimmicks inappropriate beyond the news column, with a disproportionately high number of paragraphs ending in a quote, a rhetorical question, or a punch line (and on occasion all three). A good intro to the subject, but look elsewhere for serious analysis. Friedman seems to have a sound understanding of the subject matter, however his journalistic flare and heavy-handed story telling obscure much of what he is attempting to convey. Over-written and under-edited."
2,Money can do no wrong,"Friedman is the perfect cheerleader for the unbridled exercise of financial power. This viewpoint has no sensitivity for national histories, sovereignty, and the rights of peoples to order their collective lives as they choose. Furthermore, it's all ""inevitable"". You're just an Luddite Ostrich with your head in the sand if you're concerned about the loss of manufacturing jobs in the U.S. This point of view insists there is a labor shortage in the U.S.--when there is only a shortage of wage slaves willing to work at Third World poverty levels. This book is not an attempt to understand global trade. It is a polemic designed to discredit pro-labor and nationalist viewpoints."
2,Shallow and outdated post 9-11,"This work provides a general understanding of the drivers behind globalization, but Friedman often leaves concepts in mid-air without closure. And for that reason much of the book seems like speculation or 'best guess as to why' Q&A.Friedman's admiration for Enron will make you giggle and the little attention he gives to terrorism as a backlash to globalization weakens the entire work.Perhaps so much has changed since 9/11/01, its outdated that quickly.I would recommend it for high school students as an intro to the topic."
1,"IT'S GLOBALICIOUS! (Harper's, Oct. 1999)","Not an extended analysis of the costs/benefits of the ""new"" world economy but an adrenaline-fueled, wide-eyed, superficial ""everythings for the best"" in this the most perfect of all possible worlds. I almost can see Friedman at the wheel of his virtual Lexus, talking on his cell phone, selling France, holding Korea,ignoring the speed limits and running me over."
1,"Silly, simple, cloying","In addition, to making no serious addition to the thinking on this topic, the author managed to bombard the reader with a series of cliches, anecdotes, and undergraduate theses. Near the end, exhausted from the first few chapters, I was forced to give up, to put it down."
1,Didn't bother finishing,"If you have a short attention span, then this book is not for you. I thought being a newspaper person would have made Friedman concise and to the point, but Friedman spends so much time talking about things that are not directly related to the point that I gave up on this book. I may have cheated myself (I thought the same of Ayn Rand but did make it through Atlas Shrugged which is one of my favorites.) but I don't have the time for his wanderings."
3,Not terribly original...,"Friedman clearly isn't the first to discuss the implications of globalization; others have come before him -- Omaehe (The End of the Nation State), Barber (Jihad vs MacWorld) and Fukayama (The End of History).Friedman's thesis thus isn't incredibly original -- but at least he tells it with wit and spunk. The reading can fun, but consistently interrupted by the introduction of new metaphors. In every other chapter, he tries too hard to coin new terms. There must be more than two dozen spots in the book where he goes... ""I call this XXX.""It gets painful to read after a while.The fact is, everyone who's plugged into Amazon already has a good idea of how technology has changed the way we buy and sell. Don't get too excited to buy this book.But if you're interested in his coverage of Middle East politics, ""From Beirut to Jerusalem"" is a fine account."
4,"An interesting, multifaceted view of world interactions...","Friedman does an excellent job of caputring the differences and similarites between cultures that continue to keep us apart in the face of accellerating globalization. Although I don't agree with all of his points, it's an interesting read. There are some points in the book when I wish he would go into further depth to explain how things will change in the future rather than just explaining the past and present. Overall, a recommended book if you're trying to understand how the world operates as an interlocking system of socio/ethnic/economic forces."
5,Reportorial treatment of globalization's issues,"In essence, Thomas Freidman writes his survey of globalization like a series of newspaper columns. Since he is a highly successful reporter and columnist for the New York Times, this is scarcely surprising. People who would prefer a more abstract, deeper, or more condensed treatment will do well to look elsewhere, but Friedman's book is very good of its kind. It is lively, clear, and well written. Above all, it is reasonably thorough and quite well balanced. While Friedman believes that globalization is generally a good thing, he is aware of the many concerns and doubts about the phenomenon and treats them well. It has now been two years since this revised edition appeared and a great deal has happened, including the dot-com crash and September 11. Aside from a few points of detail, however, (eg, his encomia to Enron and its CEO Kenneth Lay on pp 387-388) there is little that sounds out of touch."
2,"If I read one more cute acronym, I will scream!","This could have been a good book, as the author offers some useful insights into the process of globalization.Unfortunately, it is so riddled with cute acryonyms (i.e. DOSCapital 3.0) and repetition that it was difficult to take the author seriously. I don't like to critize other authors, being a writer myself. However, the author's penchant for constant self-reference and annoying acronyms made the book unreadable (for me anyway). Plus, much of the material is dated, as the book is filled with references to now defunct (or nearly defunct) Internet companies, which are held up as shining examples of the New Economy.While this book offers some useful insights into global economics, I would not recommend it."
5,MUST READ to understand the modern global economy,"Friedman uses wonderful symbols to explain complex trends in the global economy. The ""golden straight-jacket"" the ""electronic herd"" etc., etc.. Friedman has a definite theory on what the global economy is and where it is going. He explains it clearly, concisely, simply and artfully. Friedman explains his theories using wonderful quotes and poignant discussions with world leaders and movers. His access to the power people in the world is impressive. Wonderful.My one criticism is that I think he fails to criticize the big financial speculators for their questionably unethical manipulation of the worlds markets...especially the emerging markets."
2,Free Trade Candy,"If you have read Friedman and are feeling like a free trade warrior, you need to read William Greider's One World Ready or Not as an antidote."
4,Mr. Friedman writes the same way he speaks.,"While this book could have been written by a ghost writer, the evidence would dictate otherwise. Mr. Friedman writes exactly as he speaks. There is a looping, almost non-linear style to both forms of his communication. At first, I found him difficult to listen to on Washington Week in Review on PBS. Likewise, I found his writing style awkward to read at first.However, the importance of his points in the book overshadow any distraction his style might cause. Globalization seems to be a rather obvious phenonmenon. Nevertheless, Mr. Friedman has a keen grasp of its ramifications. Sometimes the obvious has unintended or unforeseen implications. He deals effectively with these.The book is enjoyable, incisive, and at times poetic. He engages in a lot of name dropping, but this may be forgiveable, since the names support his examples, and after all, he is a reporter who would actually know the ""victims."""
1,Ugh,"Journalistic shlock at its worst. No doubt this book has come into the public consciousness because of Mr. Friedman's position, but not due to its merits. On the whole, it's a rather poor effort, as it seems to be lacking serious thought or analysis, and seems merely like an extended newspaper column. If you want to use it to play buzzword bingo, on the other hand, it should prove excellent. If you want a serious book that contains actual analysis, try looking at ""Future Perfect"" from Micklethwait and Wooldridge."
2,"Biased Book , Inaccurate Thesis","Mr Friedman makes some interesting points about globalization in his book , which I would characterize as biased and one sided. His argument that you are on the globalization train or not is suspect and misleading. Globalization is not in the pocket of some one or is it the posesssion of some country, which Mr Friedman wrongly believes are the western countries. Yes , many countries need to learn a lot from westernize countries to develop themselves, however to charcaterize that such countries who have not yet gotten on the globalization train have nothing to offer or that Globalization cannot leearn some thing from these countries is misleading and inaccurate. Globalization is about bringing about the best in all the countries either is it China or USA, Egypt or Israel, India or Pakistan and each country learning from each other and adopting best practices from each other."
3,Twisted arm,"I read this book for a class I was taking - only because it was required. Parts of it were understandable, but in my opinion Thomas Friedman likes to hear himself talk and is a quite full of himself. I will definately be returning this book to the bookstore!"
1,"Friedman, Expert on Everything","Yes, of course, Mr. Friedman, you are right. As if your brand of modern life is inherently better than all those ever tried. It is nothing but your own olive tree, your secular god, but you are too smug to admit it. Rather than explaining globalization, Friedman gives nothing but a tired case for the advancement of new an removal of the old -- as if 3 centuries of writers had not done the subject justice (and Hume, Locke and Hayek were far better writers than Friedman). So, unless you are a fawning sycophant who believes the self-appointed expert on everything, Thomas Friedman, you might want to find an original, thought provoking and insightful book to explain globalization. This one surely isn't."
4,Sure to Stir,"Good introductory review of the global economic world we live in. A must read for Americans and why others like, and dislike, the United States. Friedman is certain to irritate those with opposing views through his candid commentary. I found the book piqued my interest in learning more about the subject of globalization. It has set me on the path of seeking views of others, particularly those with a non-American frame of reference."
5,An Important book,"Rather a terrific book, this - One that I will have my son read. It provides a terrific framework into which world events can be placed and interpreted.It remains interesting throughout. I predict this book will be long remembered as one of the best of its kind from our era."
4,SOUL BROTHERS,Not bad. Something for those who missed out on super soul singin'A pleasent hour of listening. You may have most of these.But this time you get a nice set from the Soul Brothers
3,Something is missing...,"I wonder about the influence of Christianity in Mr. Mitchell's translation. This version is too closely translated into Western language to appear as genuine. It is just too obvious. It is easy and it is accessible, but something is lacking."
3,A smooth translation is not always an accurate translation,"Stephen Mitchell's translation is one of a kind: its simplicity matches the original and it makes a classical text accessible to modern English readers. That is quite an accomplishment, no doubt. But, at times, it is shockingly inaccurate. If you have any knowledge of Chinese, compare Mitchell's translation of Chapters 5 and 6 with the original. While his 14-year-old course in Zen training is certainly a plus, this translation, alas, is not made from the Chinese original. That he looked at the ideograms while working on his translation sounds absurdly amusing, reminiscent of the complex example of Pound's ""invention"" of Chinese poetry."
4,A Great Translation of Lao-tzu and Taoism,"Taoism is a very interesting Chinese religion/philosophy. Eastern religion is very different from Western Religion. Rather than focusing on God and mans relationship with God, many of the Eastern Religions are more philosophical and advocate a way of life. This is why many people in East Asia practice elements of all of these religions and in many cases do not even know they are. It is also with this in mind that Buddhism became to popular in China and other parts of Asia. Buddhism unlike Taoism or Confucianism dealt with an afterlife.Well sorry for the lecture, in terms of Taoism I like this translation very much. I found it well presented and very easy to follow. Taoism and the whole idea of the way, Ying and Yang, balance and harmony with nature too me is one of the most interesting of the world's religions. Anyone who would like to read about this philosophy/religion would enjoy this book.It is food for thought."
5,non committal....,....spiritualityfor borrowers like me this book makes the most senseit helped me through a dark place.... again.it makes you feel connected to all those whom have tread before you and to the existing energies.and it will seem strangely familiar the first time you read it.good for people that don't want to be preached at or barked at and just want to be.... this will help you be whatever that isLao tzu also invented bowling.... discusshaenjoy the book and read a couple of chapters at most per sitting and absorb.
1,Warhead?,"The word warhead appears in this text. When I read it, I became suspicious of the entire book and the reading became unpleasant as a result. After reading reviews, my worst fear was affirmed: this is not the Tao Te Ching. This is more of a paraphrase of various translation with the author's own language thrown in.I know that the Tao cannot be conveyed through words. It is better to say that the Tao Te Ching describes around it, like hands attempting to contain a ball, concealing it so that it cannot be seen while hinting at its shape and size. The ball is there, but the hands conceal it. Lift the hands and the ball shall be seen! It is not there, but it is. This book is like a pair of hands, but they are dirty. They have been sneezed in. It is impolite to offer one's hand to shake when it has been sneezed in!"
1,This is not a translation of the Tao-te ching,"Buy and enjoy this book if you like Stephen Mitchell, but don't fool yourself that it has much to do with Taoism or the original Chinese text. This is an ""interpretation"" by someone who knows no Chinese and little about China. If you want to find out what the Tao-te ching says, look up the excellent translations by Robert G. Henricks, D.C. Lau, or Arthur Waley"
1,stephen mitchell presents the tao te ching,"The tao te ching is a great book, I'm not giving that a one star review, I'm giving mitchell's interpretation of it one star. As many other reviews have stated, he doesn't speak chinese, so this translation is comprised of his reading other peoples' translations and what he thinks it means. He then tries to modernize it and make it accessible to 21st century americans. I like the old world feel of this book, you don't need to change swords to nuclear warheads, I know what a sword is. At least though, this change makes sense, some chapters Mitchell changes so much, that the entire chapter loses its meaning. A couple chapters made no sense, so I went to the back of the book where he tells what parts he changed, and then I was able to understand exactly what Lao Tzu intended to say. Don't buy this book."
2,If you're new to oriental thought...,"This, as any other translation commonly known as Tao Te Ching, is in reality just the book of Tao (Way), the book of Te (emptiness) having never been translated from the Chinese, and known only to advanced practicants of Tao Lung (Way of the Dragon). If you are interested in oriental thought, you may as well pick this translation as an introduction. People that wish to plunge deeper into Taoist thought must learn Chinese and study directly from a Si Fu (instructor) in order to truly understand it."
1,This book is NOT translated by Stephen Mitchell,"This book is misrepresented by Amazon. This book is NOT translated by Stephen Mitchell, but James Legge. I purchased the book at a suggestion of a friend. The picture of the book on the Amazon website didn't look like the cover of my friend's book, but the description said that it was recently reprinted, so I thought that it just might have a new cover. When it arrived, I noted that the translations seemed very different from the tranlastions I had seen in my friend's book. I just got together with my friend to compare books and it is indeed, not the translation by Stephen Mitchell, as Amazon represents. I am very disappointed. Amazon needs to fix this problem.As for this translation - just not what I was hoping for - Stephen Mitchell's translation seems much more poetic. Just my opinion."
4,Get Mitchell's 2CD Tao Te Ching if possible,"I preferred the whole, 2 CD, version to this more condensed version. However, if no other CD offering the Mitchell translation of the Tao Te Ching is available, I recommend that you purchase it. I have read several translations of this gentle work and, because Stephen Mitchell was a Taoist monk for 14 years studying the teachings of Lao Tzu, he gives you a mystical, heartfelt translation of this work that is far more satisfying than translations put forth through an intellectual mind."
3,Not translated by Steven Mitchell,"Most would agree that the Steven Mitchell translation is by far the best; however, this book was not translated by him. Upon receiving my book I was immediately struck by the first page that clearly reads ""Translated by James Legge"". While his translation is good, it is not what I thought I was paying for."
1,Tao Te Ching false cover,"the book is advertised as a translation by Mitchell but it is not, the translator is Legge. The ""look inside this book"" switches to a different book by Mitchell. The ad is a total misrepresentation - false advertising."
5,There's no sin in making something intelligible,"I, like many other reviewers of this translation, have read various translations of the Tao. I like this one because it is clear. It may not be the truest translation, but, like Coleman Barks' The Essential Rumi, it seems to get the essence across.I also have the Cd by Mitchell, but prefer the book. When I read the book I can re-read certain phrases, but listening to the entire book is psychically overwhelming. There's just too much to comprehend.I would also recommend Ursula LeGuin's translation of the Tao. It feels very different from this one. She had studied the Tao for many decades (since childhood) before attempting her own take on it. It's a little harder to grasp, but worth a careful read, or hundreds of careful reads.That's what makes these books so great: you can re-read them and come away with something new and helpful every time."
5,Tao for Everyone,"Any fan of this work knows that finding the right translation is key. I've been through five different translations, and this is easily my favorite. Mitchell's take on this classic and inspiring text is clear yet open enough that it should be accessible to all who read it.Of course, a large part of this is due to (in my humble opinion) his escaping a perfectly literal translation. For the more discerning, a more direct translation is recommended. However this leads to abrupt halts and bumps in the work as you pause to interpret the eastern symbolism. I personally consider that as detracting from the true essence of the Tao Te Ching. Mitchell's tone and diction are a far better match to the subject at hand than any other translation I've ever read.In general, if you want a fluent and insightful take on the Tao Te Ching, I highly recommend Mitchell as a first read!"
2,"Good Intro, but Skylight Illuminations is the best","This is a decent introduction, but it's the author's interpretation. It's not authentic. Some people may say that's not a bad thing. It is if you haven't read the authentic interpretation and translation by Skylight Illuminations and haven't been able to compare."
5,Tao Te Ching is nothing short of wonderful,"Tao Te Ching is a wonderful experience to read. It truely opened up my mind to a better world, a world that I was badly in need of experiencing. This book is a great beginning for those interested in Eastern/World religions/philosophies as well as an exeptional book to read over and over again, to remind you of the truths of life."
4,Not bad for a guy who doesn't even know the language!,"Having read many different translations of this text, I went into this expecting little else but flowery prose from Mitchell. I was, however, pleasantly surprised with what I read. Mitchell does a fine job bringing the text to a human level. Because of the ""beginner"" guideline that he seems to be shooting for, I was surprised and disappointed that he didn't go a bit deeper into the history of the philosophy in the intro. Nevertheless, the content of the book itself moved me to place this edition with some of my favorites, and even prompted me to frequently give the edition as a gift. Highly recommended, especially if you are looking to discover the essence of what Lao Tzu probably had in mind in the first place."
2,This book sorely misses the mark.,"Mitchell has apparently given in to the ""fast- food Chinese take-out"" syndrome. I have read scores of translations of the Tao Te Ching, and Mitchell's work does not even deserve to be called a translation. While Mitchell may be a poet of sorts, and knows how to impart a fuzzy touchy-feely sensation to the reader, he has not shown any ability to transmit knowledge (let alone wisdom) to his readers."
5,A must reading for any meditation student,"This is a must reading for any meditation student, no matter which school. Mr.Mitchel's translations based on his interpretations and personal understanding of these philosophies are utterly correct, in my opinion. Highly reccommended."
1,New age garbage,"As Stephen Mitchell admits in the introduction, he cannot read Chinese. Instead, he uses translations by other people to construct his own interpretation of the text. When he comes across chapters he doesn't agree with, he simply removes them and writes something totally new. Apparently he thinks some Zen training qualifies him to translate an ancient text, while being completely ignorant of its language or the tradition of Daoism (which is far more than the philosophy of Laozi or Zhuangzi). This book is really just another useless commodity catering to the prejudices and fantasies of the New Age crowd."
5,The Most Beautiful Version of the Tao De Ching I have read.,"If it hadn't been for Stephen Mitchell's version, I don't think i would have attempted readin the Tao. When I discovered the Taoist section in the bookstore, i began reading most of the versions under this title. Most translations were dry, although, the author's of these books may have been more exact in their translation. But when I read Stephen Mitchell's version, i felt a ""wide-openness,"" a gentleness, a quietness that is inexplicable. i've had this book for about 2 years now, and i still read it several times a week. Anyone who is deeply interested in the poetic nature of spirituality, this is the version for you.This is a 10-star book. Thank you Stephen Mitchell"
2,Questionable translation,"There is no doubt Stephen Mitchell's translation is one of the most beautiful and fluent versions. The problems of this translation, however, lie in the author's view of Tao-te Ching as a religious/spiritual book, and his obvious personal love of Zen. Tao-te ching is not a religious book, it is the basic philosophy of Chinese Taoism. The Taoism philosophy has been deeply inbedded in Chinese minds and culture. It is simply an everyday-live philosophy, and it's meant for every body. This beautifully worded translation unfortunately mystified Tao-te Ching as a spiritual guide, and somehow tranformed it into a book full of Zen concepts."
1,"Overly simplistic, lacking in depth","There are much better translations of the Tao Te Ching out there. One gets the sense from reading the Stephen Mitchell translation that it was tailored to sell in the west. I would recommend the Red Pine translation above all any day of the year, as it makes use of all discovered versions of the Tao Te Ching in its translation, and includes commentaries on each verse from scholars of the past 2000 years."
1,This is not the Tao Te Ching,"Sweetly written. Purely subjective, PERSONAL, POLITICIZED, interpretation of a revered, and ancient work of wisdom. If you know nothing of Taoism, you'll like this. If you wish to hear the voices of the ancient Chinese masters, you won't find them here."
2,There are better translations,"The Tao Te Ching is a gem in human thought, yet there are much better versions. Mitchell's book isn't a translation, but an interpolation, which means that Mitchell, who doesn't speak Chinese and isn't a Taoist, compared other's translations and created his own version. To some extent, Mitchell's version may be helpful to those who are new to Taoism, yet it fails to capture the subtle grace and dance of the Taoist heart."
4,Money hungry fake spiritual author,"FYI for anyone interested in buying a book from this guy- he is suing Wayne Dyer for Plagiarism. The Tao Te Ching is one of the most translated books in the world. To me, Steve might have a case, but to actually file a law suit is incredibly insane. I have no respect for this man. He lost all credibility when I heard he was suing Wayne. Just another money hungry spiritual author cashing in."
3,Tao Te Ching - not too shabby,"This is a light read, easy to get into. I enjoyed it for the most part."
3,"A flawed, but modern translation","The Tao Te Ching isn't easy to translate, and despite the praise some people have made of this book, it's really not that spectacular. The translation seems to be so-so, and though it tries to be modern and thus relevant, some of the attempts to be modern fall flat and untrue. The commentary at the end is virtually useless and far too ""Western.""However, this is a useful ""e-z-read"" Tao Te Ching if you have read other versions and thus know where the author got fanciful. The spirit of the original does shine through, but only if you know where to look."
1,this interpetation ...,"if you want to know more about taoism or the tao te ching dont get this version. its horrible. you need a more literal interpretation of this gret writing in order to really get what it is trying to say. not everything in the tao te ching has a literal interrpretation and this book tries to. for instance the ""tao"" isnt necessarily the ""way"". it can be interpreted in many different ways. the tao is the tao and nothing else. buy a real version of this book."
2,A useful exercise,"Mitchell writes well; his Tao Te Ching comes across as more poetic than most translations I've read. But while the words are prettier the meaning seems lost at times. I agree with the reviewers on here who criticise Mitchell for paraphrasing ligitimate translations and often missing the point. However, I still feel like his version is worth reading. By questioning this version (which you probably will if you've read a real translation) you promote your understanding of Tao Te Ching."
2,not a good beginning,"i purchased this on a whim, and, if i could i would sell it back for the simple reason that i find Mitchell distorts the essence of the way by trying to define it thereby limiting it. If one reads the Tao te Ching, one learns that ""the way that can be named is not the eternal way"" to quote another, truer version of the text.i have several versions of this ancient classic, and this is my least favorite. it diverges too far away from the essentials. It seems to me that Mr. Mitchell got carried away with the sound of his authority. Sort of like the sound of one hand clapping, as it were."
2,Not for me,"Didn't really ""get"" it. I only bought it after it was mentioned in ""A Million Little Pieces"". Not for me so I couldn't reccommend it to anyone else."
3,chinese religion,"This book is probably well done if you want this stuff. I do not find the content useful or particularly attractive. The idea that I was really good for my 79 years, with just a few slip-ups every day seems laughable. I need a Savior, am glad to be a Christian."
5,Pure poetry.,"Stephen Mitchell has produced a translation of the Tao Te Ching that is accessible, relevant and timeless. He has taken the stiltedness out of translations that seek to hew too closely to the original phrase, and rendered the text with a spare poetry that is both personal and useful. This is the place to start thinking about the Tao."
5,mitchell delivers the sense elegantly and accessibly,"To me this is the definitive translation of one of the best books ever written (and I have read dozens of versions). Stephen has translated not just the written word but the sense and meaning behind them. While it may seem modernized in some places, this is only right if these ideas are to be communicated effectively to modern minds. Lao Tzu would surely have used different language if he were alive today! Mitchell, I believe, has rendered what Lao Tzu (presumably) said in the most concise, straightforward, and aesthetic manner I have yet seen."
1,Not Even Close,"STAY AWAY FROM THIS TRANSLATION. It is written by a poet who does not even speak/read Chinese and is so chopped up and poorly translated that it retains virtually none of the original meaning. There is a good translation out there by Gia Fu Feng and Jane English.This book is a pure marketing scheme and amounts to cultural colonialization (or cultural theft). If you want to learn more about real Taoism, try searching for books that are published by university presses - not the discount bin at Walden Books. All you will find there is westernized treatments that have been radically altered from their original states in order to make them more digestible for the ignorant western mind.As well, if you are really interested in practicing Taoism, you should shop around for a good Tai Chi or Qijong instructor (sifu). Try to find one that really emphasizes the spiritual side of the martial arts."
2,Great Book / Bad Format,"I used to have the hardback edition of this book, a well-bound book on quality paper with old school, cut-edge pages. Classy and Beautiful. Unfortunately this book is not only paperback -which I knew when I ordered - but it's a tiny 3""x5"" pocket version, which I didn't realize. The cover is identical to the original so it's easy to be decieved. Considering the size and the super cheap binding it's hardly worth the price Amazon is charging.However the content is priceless."
1,Totally useless,"It is amazing that a supposed authority on accents, Dr. Stern, would be associated with this book (and especially the cassette that goes with it.). He is - allegedly - a dialect coach to the Stars. It may explain some of the atempts at foreign accents that have recently come out of Hollywood. The accents on the cassette are nothing short of embarrassing - A cringe a minute. I asked a fellow actor to listen to the French accent and guess what it was: He guessed Spanish! If you want a first rate book on accents, buy Robert Blumenfeld's ""Accents - A Manual for Actors"". Now where do I go to get my money back?..."
1,NOTHING of value here...,"I recently bought the CD version of this, and I am compelled to warn people who are thinking of buying this. If you are at a;; serious about learning dialects, do NOT buy this CD. ... A high school drama student would have done a superior job. You would be better off learning dialects from the Simpsons or Saturday Night Live. This is not an exaggeration, this is a flat out warning. Don't waste your money. ... Pygmalion is old school cockney. Not modern. You want authentic Cockney? Try ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" and ""Love, Honor and Obey."" They're the best. ""Scum"" and ""The Krays"" are also pretty good. And that's on the authority of a real cockney girl (my girlfriend)."
1,Thrown out trash from some library,"This item had been withdrawn from the Timberland Regional Library Service Center in Olympia, Washington and it looked like it had been put in the trash. When I buy something at Amazon I expect a quality product. This was a tape and booklet of dialect monologues, library code CAS 792.028,Karshner 1990."
5,very intimate sonnambula,"I bought this set on advice from previous reviewers. Thank you. It is outstanding performance. Very different from the modern performance practices were the orchestra is blazing and singers have to scream to be heard. None of these here. It is the singers opera. And they do a superb job. Tagliavini is outstanding all the way. His duets with Pagliughi is unsurpassed. The only minor complain is Lina Pagliughi's coloratura in the last Amina's caballeta. Not as clean as it could be. But that does not spoil overall quality of performance. The parformance has a very intimate, almost chamber feel to it.Very highly recommended."
4,Very Nice!,I am quite pleased with this faucet..great value for the money! Only down side is the color is darker than I would like but still a lovely piece.
4,How does the pop-up drain work???,"Excellent faucet as a whole....I just had a problem trying to figure out how in the world to install the pop-up drain lever so that it would work right! After working with it for an hour or two I finally got it to the point where I could pull up on the lever about 1/2 inch and press down on the plug to get it to seal, and then push it down to get the basin to drain. But I am still not sure it is right! Otherwise, installation was very simple. Also, I found out that the faucet does not mount well without using the base."
4,Don't buy to import PDF files,"I bought this upgrade solely because of the claimed ability to convert PDF files into text files. After I bought the upgrade, I discovered that scanned PDF files cannot be converted to text. This means only a small percentage of files can be converted using X3.X3 will open scanned PDF files as an image file, but that does me no good.I ended up buying another program on the internet that has a built-in OCR feature. (Able2Doc Professional)"
2,Not Worth The Upgrade,"I upgraded from Wordperfect Office 12 to X3, but have returned the upgrade to Wordperfect. The much touted ability to import PDF files is so poorly implemented that it is all but unusable. In addition, the Wordperfect Mail component will not load data files while my antivirus (ZoneAlarm) is running in the background. Corel Technical Support takes no responsibility for the incompatability. Do not upgrade unless these issues are addressed."
3,Deja Vu anyone? Many too simplistic...,"I know there are only so many things that can be done with a prism, but still...there are other designs that could be combined with prisms to add more interest, challenge and fun. Each page looked like a copy of the one before it, with maybe a new angle or a bigger set of triangles. In the back of the book, there are 3 of 4 very advanced designs that I wish had been made into a whole book of like designs. If you're just starting out and don't mind repeating the same ""look"", then you may like it. I gave my brand new one to a friend instead. I recommend Power Mandala's instead, for variety, complexity and challenging fun."
2,"this coloring book... i would say is a ""no""...","Yes, all the designs look like copies. To be more specific, take the design you see on the cover or an excerpt from the inside, and the shape, the outermost outline, is the same for every picture. Except maybe sometimes the 4 mini hexagons are triangles. Besides that, every picture is the same thing, with different triangles on the inside.Overall, the quality and the designs aren't bad at all, the only bad thing is that they are SO REPETETIVE!"
4,hours of frustrating pleasure,"There are designs here suitable for ages 5-70.Be sure to print off as many copies as you can before using the paper itself, you will need them. I first bought this book five years ago, gave it away when I thought I was done and now am redressing my mistake and buying several copies. I have rarely seen more variety in shapes within a single framework. And trust me that's saying something.Warning: 3 designs of this book can be insanely difficult to color but that's why it pays to wait for inspiration!"
3,So-so Coloring Book,While not the worst coloring book I have purchased it is not one of my favorites. I agree with the other reviews in that there is too much repetition in the patterns. They are way too similar for my taste. Each design has a minor variation from the one before it. I like more of a challenge when coloring and this book did not really give me that. I have purchased other Ruth Heller books and this one did not live up to the expectations.
4,Good Serving Cart,"The cart is fairly easy to assemble, but, be careful orienting the top front support between the sides. This has the latch for the right front door on it and if you get it upside down the entire cart has to be disassembled. This is a solid, attractive peice of furniture any one would be proud to display in their home."
2,Not so good,"Firstly, it came incomplete: the two ""keepers"" for the towel bars - and they keep the top of the table when it is opened - weren't in the package. And there were not enough small items for assembly of the cart in the package as well.Secondly, it is not as solid as I read about it. If I could see this cart in a store, I wouldn't buy it. It looks cheap though it costs some money.The only reason I give it 2 stars: it is easy to assemble when you have enough screws and pins (not in my case)."
2,Its OK,"I should have read the product specs more closely, I missed the part about being unassembled. For the price you would have expected it to be ready for use upon arrival. Knowing what I know now I doubt I would have bought the unit. If you're not a do-it-yourselfer or know some who is or not willing to hire someone to assemble this cabinet you should keep shopping for a cart thats ready to use."
5,Great scent!,"I have a very hard time finding scents that don't give me a headache. This fragrance is Great! The scent is vanilla but the grapefruit cuts the sweet! If you like this fragrance I would recommend getting the set, it is the same item/price as the single bottle with a 2.75 lotion in a pretty packaged set."
5,Wonderful,"I rarely write reviews, but I had to with this. I finally purchased this over the weekend at my local Sephora store after stopping in a few times to try it on. I absolutely love it. I am sensitive to a lot of perfumes, but because this is natural it hasn't bothered me a bit. I've always worn vanilla based perfumes (I guess it's my signature scent!), but this really is my favorite so far. It is fresh and youthful, yet grown-up and sensual."
5,A new scent addiction,"This product came on time and I actually received some free samples with it which was cool. It is a strong scent, lasts all day, and I love it!!!!"
3,Too much vanilla,"I bought this in hopes that it would have more of a grapefruit smell, because I read an article saying that guys are attracted to the smell of grapefruit, lol. I'm personally not a big fan of vanilla, but this was the only grapefruit perfume that I found so I tried it. If you like vanilla then you may like this. The grapefruit is just way to subtle for my taste. I have to rub it in (which they say not to do because it changed the chemical structure) in order for an ever slight scent of grapefruit to be noticable. Basically if you want grapefruit more than vanilla don't buy this."
1,Yuck! Zero stars,I had such high hopes. Read some really great reviews and know them to produce great stuff. Friends of mine love their products.This smell awful and it's still sitting in the package.Sending it back.
4,Love the scent but . ..,Love the scent but this oil version is not so long lasting as the perfume bottle. Nice to carry around in your purse though. I love that they are composed of essential oils.
5,ENJOYABLE READ,"A fast paced book with an interesting plot and a plausible hero in John Taft. Good first novel. Enjoyed the last page, I assume T,E,S,__, A has an ""L"" in it."
4,What a surprise!,"The ""Einstein Papers"" was quite a surprise. I picked this book figuring that it would be totally about Einstein and his contributions to the world of physics. What I got instead was a book steeped in Einstein's theories but mixed pleasantly with suspense, espionage and mystery. I could not put it down. I hightly recommend this book to all."
1,Don't Bother,"I really wanted to like this book; the plot sounded interesting, and it started off okay, but the more I read it, the worse it got. The plot became highly predictable, the writing is atrocious, and the ending punchless. Mr. Dirgo is obviously a Clive Cussler wannabe, but has neither the imagination or story-telling ability (not to mention basic grasp of the English language) to even be mentioned in the same breath as Cussler. To make it to the plodding end of this book requires a lot of patience and a high tolerance for baseless dialogue."
4,A good offering of action and adventure,"This book is clearly the work of an imaginative young writer. The story line is ambitious, grandious and at times a bit overwhelming. With all that said, I think that one comes away from this book with the feeling that this is the work of a writer that coninues to mature in his writing style and over time will provide us with some very good action adventure. I think this is a good first solo effort. I enjoyed the Einstein Papers and I look forward to Dirgo's next offering."
1,How does this dribble get published?,"Are these people actually reading the book, or are they all friends of the author? I can't believe someone called this thing a spellbinding pageturner. It was a page turner allright...I couldn't turn the pages fast enough to get to the end, so as to put a halt to the misery of trying to read it. The publishing industry must really be desperate for material if they go to the trouble of printing something this bad. Do they think everybody reads at a third-grade level? The writing in Einstein is seriously less than I'd expect from a junior high school writing class. Give the good name of literature a break, and avoid this book!"
4,Excellent Debut,"The purest form of flattery is excellent imitation and Dirgo, a Clive Cussler protege, has done a great imitation of the master of modern day swashbuckling novels. The main character, John Taft is cast in the same devil may care mold as Dirk Pitt. The style and atmosphere is similar (though tamed down) as in Dirk Pitt novels. The premise that Einstein did finish his Unified Field Theory but hid it to protect the human race from itself is believable and the background story is the strongest part of the novel. The second half of the novel is weaker as the plotting is more contrived, yet it was entertaining; I spent a pleasant afternoon reading it.One note about the Kirkus review above, the reference to ""T E S ? A"" on a star map is obviously a pointer to the theme for the next John Taft novel, and not a conclusion of this one. Reviewers should really read the books that they review!"
4,fun book to read,"This is a fun book to read, it is one of the few books that has kept me up till the wee hours reading."
2,Don't make the same mistake I did!!!,I read this book because of Dirgo's collaborative efforts with Clive Cussler in the past. All Dirgo has done has copied Cussler's formula for adventure - and no where near as well. You can replace Taft and Martinez with Pitt and Giordino and Cussler could have written this. The problem is the plot is not very convincing and did not grab me the way Cussler can. Don't waste your time or money on this one...
3,"Good Book, Bad Ending","As I said, it was a really good book for about seven-eighths of it, but lost it at the ending. I really enjoyed the book, but the ending was very sketchy.It is about a lost formula of Einstein's that can be used to form a nuclear weapon. China wants it to take over Taiwan, and it is up to the U.S. to stop them. They assign John Taft, and his partner to get it. This is the plot and it is a good one, and would definitely be a five-star book if the ending wasn't up to par with the rest of the book."
2,Decent first novel,"This book was good cheap entertainment. It kept a fairly steay flow until the last 80 pages. As far as content goes, the prologue was the best part. For the most part, it and it's cookie cutter characters where utterly forgetable. The rendition of Einstein and the Chinese Military threat where interesting, but somewhat shallow, never truly delivering. Mr. Dirgo must starve himself while writing, because his preoccupation with what thte characters where eating and drinking and had already eaten and drank before we got there was almost scary! Got a long plane ride ahead of you? Go ahead."
4,"well paced, written in the style of Clive Clusser","Book kept me on the edge, finished it in three days. Quite any interesting insight into the man Einstein, alright, so its fiction but still interesting. great book for the summer.hope to hear more from Mr Dirgo. thks Man. Dennis"
4,Dirgo brings something extra to the genre,"Clive Cussler is still very much in the top ranks of winning adventure novelists, but if and when the time comes for a successor-designate to be chosen, Craig Dirgo has the right to claim the appellation. Like Cussler, Dirgo knows how to keep a story moving quicker than a Bruce Willis flick. (Willis, of course, would be a natural for Dirgo's hero, John Taft.) Like most of the successful books of its genre, ""The Einstein Papers"" is built on a grand scale, world survival at stake and all that, and Dirgo does a masterful job of maneuvering all the pieces to produce gripping drama. But Dirgo gives his style and his hero a special fillip which lifts the book above others in tis class: He adds a touch of whimy to his action and make it fun to read. Dirgo has a winner."
2,Dirgo is sure not Cussler,"Even though Dirgo worked with Cussler on ""Clive Cussler and Dirk Pitt Revealed"" he doesn't seem to have learned how to write a good ""thriller"". After the first ""James Bond"" escape he makes his heros look like a couple of keystone cops for much of the rest of the book, ""The Einstein Papers"". His main character, John Taft, is supposed to be like Dirk Pitt but he's a bit off-- maybe because he drinks ginger ale instead of tequila. And Taft's sidekick, Martinez, has promised his wife he won't fight. Some of his premises are so far out as to be not even good science fiction. For example, Dirgo has his characters get several hundred cylotrons ""scavenged from storage racks and test centers"" and place one in each old plane at Davis-Monthan Air Base. Does he know that a cyclotron weigh many TONS? Oh well--maybe he can take another lesson from Cussler sometime!"
4,"Bustouts is inadequate, if entertaining.","This documentary type video does show some of the seamier side of the poker world - now often very over-glamorized on television. And there is truth to it, as I have played with most of the people shown. The unfortunate aspect is that it gives a false impression that this is the low end of this world. The true low end of this world is much worse - really sorry dogs and very damaged people. As simple entertainment it is not bad (more realistic than Hollywood's attempts), as reality it is still misleading."
2,huh?,"I'm a huge fan of the musicians but not a fan of this work. I'm lost and I think they may have been too. Jaco does not shine here. He is poking, along with Metheny, they are just poking at something - I don't know what. I also agree with another reviewer that the recording is not of good quality. The studio engineer and Producer (Bley) get zero stars."
2,Freeform...or just formless? Where's the music?,"It's hard to say what this one is all about. It's rather unpleasant listening...but I gave it a second star just for the experimental effort. Unfortunately, the experiment seems to have failed.Nothing here. Not worth the hard work of listening."
1,Unlistenable.,"Great musicians, miserable music. Unless you have a thing for free-jazz the music here is truly unlistenable. No sense of melody or structure, just talented musicians playing lost. To find Metheny and Pastorious in a better light check out P.M's Bright Size Life...Simon"
1,"Once upon a time, some great musicians decided to suck.","This album is shrill nonsense. Many brilliant artists occassionally make crap. A few that come to mind: Andy Warhol, Jack Keruoac, Stanley Kubrick. The list will never end, so long as artists feel -- I suppose KNOW -- that they aren't corraled by what they've done in the past with great success (that is to say, affinity with their fans, and the art appreciating public).Hooey to that, before I sound like an art critic...and a bad one at that. The long and short of it is that this album falls into the same free-form waste of time circular file as Trey Anastasio's Surrender to the Air, which wasted the talents of such modern notables as Oteil Burbridge, John Medeski, Mark Ribot and many others. So here goes wasted the potential of another Metheny/Pastorius coupling, a la the beautiful Bright Size Life. The album is poop."
5,A great production,"50 minutes. This CD takes you into the role of Pok, a young Klingon man. You hear Klingons around you on the ship and learn how Klingons interact with other races and with each other. A very good production narrated by Michael Dorn (Worf), and directed by Jonathan Frakes (Riker)."
4,Audrey Auld Review,She has a great voice and does some good stuff. I love to hear her speaking accent! I'm glad she's now headquartered in the U.S.
5,Works great,"Works just fine. I was worried that the three foot cable wouldn't be long enough, but I use it to transfer video from my camcorder to my laptop, and I've yet to be bothered by the cable. The transfer software that came with my Dell works great, and the cable itself performs wonderfully. No complaints."
4,gets the job done,"This cable gets the job done, and you can't beat the price. I have not had any problems transferring video."
3,Worked as expected,"there is no much to say about a cable, just that the brand is good, the only thing is that the lenght is quite short for my expectations but it is ok."
4,Belkin IEEE 1394 FireWire Compatible 4pin/4pin Cable (3-foot),"Good FireWire compatible cable. I used it to connect my digital video camera to my laptop, with super download speed. I only wished I had ordered a longer cable, otherwise you can't go wrong with this cable."
5,Great!!,The cord worked great for what I needed. They shipped the cord out fast. I received the cord much fast than expected.
5,Cheap and wonderful,"I was bit confused after reading negative reviews. I received the product and oooh..it is the best..for 9 buck who would give this cable for you?. The build quality the superb. IT records my video beautifully(though i used for a day only) ..I have not got any problem with this. I believe that this is original belkin. I don't care if it is not. Another thing is I checked this cable in local radio shack ($33) and that also did not have belkin name on the cable. Do not worry about whether this is belkin or not. Amazon can not sell duplicate Belkin product so public. So, go ahead and buy it ..no body sells cheaper than this."
5,"Feels bulletproof, ideal for laptop","Connects our camcorder to my laptop exactly as expected. It's a cable, what more do you need to know?Well...construction is sturdy, heavily shielded, maybe slight overkill for 3 feet of cable, but it's safe to say this thing won't break easily. The heavy shielding does reduce flexibility; if that bothers you then look elsewhere.It's also an ideal length for use with a laptop, but you may want to make sure that 3' really is long enough for your situation."
3,The muslin shreds,"It's nice to have the varying sizes of muslin, but if you need to cut it down it shreds easily and the threads get everywhere."
2,"It Might Be Good, I can't Understand Most of It!","Reading this book is a difficult hack. To be honest, I often have no idea what he means even after reading a sentence several times, and looking every word up in the dictionary.I've never been able to understand Karl Marx either, and the book has a lot of Marxist rhetoric.The apologists for the vectoral interest want to limit the semantic productivity of the term ""hacker"" to a mere criminality, precisely because they fear its more abstract and multiple potential--its class potential."
2,Too long and convoluted,I agree with Publishers weekly. The plot line is way overblown and I got tired of it long before it was over.
5,Satisfied,"I do use some freeware programs depending on my needs, but for registry cleanup I use this product. It is affordable, and it does an excellent job. I used this product on both my computers for repairs, and they are both running flawlessly right now. I have absolutely no complaints so far and am pleased with the results."
2,Not a desirable scent,"The conditioning was okay, but the smell repulsed me! I would prefer something that either has no scent, or something fresh and appealing...instead of smelling so much like other common hair chemicals. Sorry, Revlon, but I used it once and threw away almost the whole bottle. I'll keep looking for one that suits me better."
2,Not much good to say,"I ordered both the Shimmer Lighys shampoo and conditioner on the recommendation of my stylist. Neither my husband nor I can stand the fragrance of either product, and the conditioner leaves my rather short hair tangled. I've had to resort to using one of those post-shampoo ""no more tangles"" type products which, even when I had hair that reached halfway down my back, I never had to use before. I will not buy these products again, and am off on another search for hair product made especially for gray hair."
1,Turned my hair purple,"The yellow stayed yellow & my hair turned purple. I've seen/heard really good things about this shampoo. Must work differently for different people. It didn't take away the yellow/brassy color either, just added purple."
5,Clairol Shrimming Lights conditioner,"Great Product: My hair is very long, below the middle of my back, my hair dresser was not able to provide this conditioner, at this price and I said to her your conditioner is the last thing to go on your hair.Thank you very muchMary"
1,Worthless product.,Horrid. My hair was more tangled than ever and showed no signs of having been conditioned.
1,DON'T BYE IT YOU WILL CRY!!!,I GOT THIS AND TELL YOU THE HONEST FACT . IN THE SOME AREA'S IT TURNED MY HAIR PURPLE.. iT MAKES IT MORE ORANGY!!Get the nice in easy light ash blonde and you will loose yellow-orange-brassy color go away for good.. I did!! I am shocked how that hair color works. Made my hair soft too. you will thank me if you do this.. We all want to be blonde not a lemon head right!! or oh my your hair is orange.. I will never use anything else diffrent. great beautiful blonde!!!!good luck all.
5,Fabulous Product!~!,"Great product for blonde hair!~! Does exactly what it says it will, leaving beautiful blonde behind :) I would recommend not using this as a daily product however as it can be harsh. Well worth the price, will definately be purchasing again. :) XOXO"
5,Beautiful Fun Game,"I ordered this for my seven year old grandson and not only does he love it, the entire family enjoys playing this simple, easy to learn and fun game! It's a beautiful, well-made board and the wells are a good size. I think anyone who likes playing board games will love Mancala. Any lost marbles can be easily replaced. I would heartily recommend this game!!"
3,Could have been written better,"Mr. Lassiter obviously possesses outstanding writing talent. However, the way he juxtaposed the order of events, made this interesting tale lack suspense or impending doom. Not confusing, just boring. Too much (the last third) of the book is post-capture, courtroom, and thankfully, prison."
4,lots of details,"Typical a lasseter book. Meaning he always writes with passion, and has an eye for details,backgrounds of victims and murderers. It has lots of pictures. It shows you how Marlow and Coffman where raised how they met,and how they spent their honeymoon (with 2 savage killings) You will hear about the victims and their family. Lassiter wrote this book 1 to commemorate the victims Corinna Novis,and Lynel Murray and 2 because he wanted to examine the lives of the couple that killed them, in the hope that he would get an answer why they did what they did. Did he understand? Is it understandable? well not for me.But definitely a great book."
4,Great Product!!,"Great product and quality for the price, is the better option for those that don't want to spend $400 in a jacket."
4,Good quality,A background story for this jacket. I looked through a Men's magazine and saw the exact same one for more then 300 dollars then what I paid. Good value for the money.The only problem was that it was shipped in a cardboard box that wasn't packed or taped very well.
5,Excellent buy,I bought this jacket for my husband. It was an excellent fit and the quality is excellent for the price! Very impressed.
4,Excellent value for money,"It's not the TOP grade of leather, but perfectly adequate for a MC jacket. Well made. Nice zip out lining. Runs a bit small ( order sizes up). Fast shipping."
4,About to reorder,"We accidentally got the wrong size. But just looking at it, it was nice. Nice leather smell, seemed thick, but not too thick. Easy return. Going to reorder this jacket soon. :)"
2,Cruddy,"Yes, I know the price is good. But after getting it, I am convinced it was a total waste of money. The leather is extremely low quality -- rough, dry and even scratched up on the back. The shoulder fit is totally out of proportion. The lining, even after I took out the zip-out vest, was too loose. Did a drunk person stitch this together?"
3,Loose fit,"The product is just as described. I will saw that it fits loosely into a hole created with a 1-1/2"" hole saw. I just put a layer or two of electrical tape around the insert and it snugged up."
4,Outsanding retelling of our effort in Somaila.,"Bowden cpatures the essence of the battle from both sides. The full range of emotions are effectively described. Bowden also illustrates tthe flip-flop of our foriegn policy and the futlity of committing troops to a no-win situation. Enlightening, Enjoyable reading"
5,Great Book. Read it.,"The most compelling thing about this book is that Bowden tells the stories of the men who were there on both sides, so the book reads like a novel rather than a collection of facts. Gripping Reading."
4,Black Hawk Down,"Black Hawk Down is a very fast paced action novel which involves lots of gun fast paced fighting and many other things that are involved wth war. I also is a sad book because the war that took place in this novel was very dramatic. Black Hawk Down takes place in Mogadishu, Somalia where U.S. forces are trying to get two druglords, Sgt. Matt Eversmann is the main character and also the chalk (sqaud) leader. Eversmann experience's alot in the war but that does not phase him, Matt is a good commander and knows how to lead his troops to victory. I really liked this book because i love action packed novels and this is a very action packed book."
1,One big fight scene that doesn't work as a book or movie,"The hype that the movie Black Hawk Down received prior to its release encouraged me to read the book: a fatal mistake. The book is as groan inducing as the movie and this is mainly because it spends so little time with character development that it's hard to care about the outcome and feel sorrow at the deaths of the soldiers. Action buffs who enjoyed the movie often criticize me by saying that this is a true account of an actual event, but even so this does not make the book any more exciting for me to read. If you are interested in knowing of what happened in Mogadishu, read the book, otherwise, steer clear of it as you would any other mindless action book/movie."
1,This book is so boring!,Way too detailed and too long. I don't have any patience for the detail... just get to the point and tell the story.
4,Black Hawk Down,Black Hawk Down by Mark Bowden might be one of the best war stories I have ever read. Iv'e always enjoyed reading novels about past wars but this book was so shockingly descriptive that it gave me chills. Bowden along with soldiers who fought in Somalia take you step by step from the invasion to the miraculous rescue with stories about the brave marines who were fighting. I had seen the movie that was made from this book and I thought that the movie was awesome but once I started to read this book I liked it more than the movie because I could create my own picture of what it was like even though the movie helped me to create a more realistic setting in my mind. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading detailed war stories. However if you dont like bloody war books this is not the book for you. I would give this book 4 starts because I loved reading it and it was very well put together.
5,Should Be Required Reading for all Military Officers,"This book was an amazing description of the events in Somalia. The author's interviews of the participants in the battle led to a realistic and unforgiving account of how the United States use of less than all available military force led to a disaster. This book balances individual accounts of heroism against very fair critisizm of the leadership involved. Overall this was an excellent review. Even if you have seen the movie, it is worth reading the book. Despite the fact that I knew the ending, I couldn't put the book down."
5,AMAZING. I cant put it down.,I have never liked to read. My dad got me Black Hawk Down as a Christmas gift and I began to read it. I havent been able to put it down. This is the first book I have ever read on my own. Most of the books I read are class assignments. I cant put this one down. Amazing Book! I cant wait to see the movie.
5,"Brave Men, Under Dire Circumstances","Without a doubt, this ranks as one of the best historical accounts of a battle I'm sure civilian America would rather forget. But to the combatants, I'm sure it's something that they never will. My hat's off to Mr. Bowden. For he finally proves to me that there ARE reporters out there that are willing to record what we have to say, and report it dilligently. As a former Spec Op soldier having never served in Solmalia, Mr. Bowden gives you the feeling of actually being there, which is very important. You're given a firsthand account of the confusion of battle, the gallantry done under fire, and the quickness of sudden death. And to my Ranger brothers and Delta Operators who fought there, and died--you'll never be forgotten by this ex-LRS man. You all did your mission well."
5,New respect to those who sacrificed,"I first read the story over Philly Inquier's web site. It's the best modern battle scene narrative I 've ever read. The bravery and courage of the rangers and the Delta troops had choked me into tears. By the end of the story, I had to put down the printout of the story and saluted these young soldiers I came to know."
5,Military medicine included,"Overall, very detailed analysis of how the SPECOPS community functions. Discusses the events of day in meticulous graphic detail. This book also dives into the seldom seen or heard aftermath of that fatal day. It demonstrates that success often comes at a price. As a physician in the military, this book also dives into the medical aspescts of war and how the triage system works. Dr Marsh had a difficult job and was faced with many decisions during his Mass Casualty. I glad to see that his expertise and military training saved as many soldiers as possible. A must read for anyone interested in Aviation, Medicine and Special Operations."
5,Great book,"This book was great! The story came across so real that I started feeling emotions for the soldiers involved. Mark Bowden does justice to all soldiers that serve in conflicts that are typically forgotten due to not being a ""war""."
5,Awsome suspense book.,You never know what'll happen next. Detailed maps to go with the story helps you stay with the book. The story itself has alot of detail. Must read today!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
5,Gripping Real Life Thriller,"I also read this book shortly before the recent terrorist attacks. Mark Bowden goes into extraordinarily and painful detail in describing the activities of 1993 in which just over 100 Army Rangers and Delta force soldiers made a daring day-light raid on the city of Mogadishu, and a bustling market-place, and captured key lieutenants of the Somali warlord.Bowden rightfully tributes the last moments of over a dozen DIA and many casualties. The book reads like a minute-by-minute action feature, and is almost impossible to put down. Given the capabilities of these special-ops soldiers, I feel a lot more confident in our on-going efforts in Afghanistan. I'm sure the Delta forces are working as we speak. Many have deemed the Somalia effort a failure, but if you read this book, you will be convinced that the soldiers of this battle accomplished their objective and achieved victory despite overwhelming obstacles."
5,Great,this was the singal greatest story of war i have evr read. He describes the situation in Somalia and how the soldiers deal with it. This is a great buy and you will not be able to put it down once you start.
5,The few and brave,"Before I read this book I've always wanted to be part of the special forces, I would picture them going into enemy territory and finish there job, kill the bad guys and get out without a loss of a single man. This book made me realize that there's alot more to that. I've read this book twice and each time I would get hooked on it. I would recommend this book to anyone intrested in special forces."
5,Heart Pounding. . .,"I felt like I was there. The heat, the smell, the blood, the horror; was so vividly real. As a former AC-130 Gunship crew member that hunted the NVA along the Ho Chi Minh Trail, ""Black Hawk Down"" transported me back to another time. . .of war.Bill MoralesAuthor, ""The Fence"""
5,War Is Hell,"Read ""Black Hawk Down,"" ""Rumor of War"" (Caputo), ""We Were Once Soldiers, and Young"" (Moore). You will understand what war is, and ponder why we can't end it. Once you begin, prepare for some sleepless nights. It's hard to put these books down, whether you are a soldier or civilian."
2,Unnecessarily dishonors the soldiers,The author was trying to be more of a journalist rather than conveying the meaning and gravity of the story. Unneeded details of men behaving badly when they are bored and alone does nothing but distract from what our country put them through. At some point in the editorial process they needed to cut out the distractions and focus on the heroism.
5,military writing at its best,"i'm trying to read all the iraq boks but i have to say...there's nothing so far that can touch this one. BHawk sets the bar very, very high for combat writing."
3,Read it NOW,"First, this nonfiction reads like a gripping action novel. Hard to put down. Better plan to lose sleep. Secondly, how could Bowden's analysis of the Mogadishu raid be more timely? Hope George Bush has read it. Hope the commanders are studying it. It is a textbook for opns going on now. Finally, Bowden achieves objectivity, detail, human interest, education, suspense, and relevance all in this compact paperback.A former Ranger."
5,The Saving Private Ryan of Books,"This book is one of the most graphic and intense military reads of all time. No other book I've read has captured the intensity of combat like this one. From start to finish, the reader actually feels like they are in the the thick of things. A five star great read."
4,"Technology gets better, but soldiers still die.","While at times this seems like you are reading an action novel, one must pause and remember that every U.S. soldier killed or wounded in this ""peacekeeping"" effort was a real person. Author Bowden, through his style, once again shows the world that when the U.S. military is micro-managed, disaster is not too far behind.No matter how noble the cause, this book does make one long for the isolationist policies of the late 1930's. As the events unfold, you are constantly asking: ""how could this happen"" and ""why is this happening"". This is a sobering account of modern day warfare gone wrong."
5,"companion piece to ""private ryan""","everybit as gripping and compelling as the movie ""saving private ryan""! This book put me in the seat of a ""HUMVEE"" and allowed me to ""feel, hear, see, smell and survive"" combat. Expressed true heroism without glorifying war."
5,"Before you enlist, read this book.","Bowden's book should be standard reading for any person considering entering the armed services. This is as factual an account of combat as I have ever read. In the end, there is no glory, just those who lived, those who died and those who were mentally and physically destroyed.For the hawks on Capital Hill, it is a stark account to read before sending boys into the void, for the doves, a poignant reminder that at times, there is evil in the world that must be confronted. I think I speak for vets across America when I say ""Well done, Mr. Bowden, well done."""
3,Black Hawk down,An interesting book given the contemp[orary nature of the incident. A bit too much detail of the action and not enough of the background to the conflict. Sections from the Somali participants were insightful.
3,Review of the audio book Black Hawk Down,"I bought this audio book for my grandfather because I thought he might like to listen to a military-themed story. He said he enjoyed it, but thought it was a bit violent. However, since it is based on a true story, that was probably unavoidable in the book."
4,A Memorial,"More photographs and I'd rate 5 stars. Kindle books on the iPhone present pictures extremely well, with the pinch-to-xoom from Apple. I want to see more pictures of this story. I'm getting a memorial tattoo from this story; the images are important."
4,"Would give it more stars, except for the maps","Yo, it's cool that reporter Mark Bowden did some hard-fought, investigative writing about a topic the U.S. military (and the Clinton-loving media) would like to forget. He conveys the misery and shock among elite U.S. troops who get bogged down in a massive firefight in Mogadishu, Somalia, while trying to complete a mission. He also provides enough detail about the struggles of the country's citizens to warm the heart of any Obama-loving apologist. My only complaint about the book is that it's very disorienting in its attempt to convey what happened on the scene of battle, and the maps in its pages, an obvious crutch, were of little help."
2,Mark's C-SPAN description was better than the book.,"I bought this book after watching the author's riveting and emotional account of this story on C-SPAN2's book review. Anyone watching this first-person account (of one of this century's worst military gaffes) would be compelled to read this book.But what a let-down! Let me just put it this way: Mr. Bowden speaks much more succinctly and powerfully than he writes. For all of you Stephen King fans out there, this is the ""Bag of Bones"" of military stories. Tons and tons of endless--and seemingly irrelevant--character development (or fluff, as I call it) that works better than any OTC sleep inducer.But that's just my opinion. I'm more of a Tom Clancy fan when it comes to war stories. And even he tends to go off on endless tangents."
2,Wannabe,"Mark Bowden's non-fiction book Black Hawk Down is at best mediocre and should have been better researched before publication. Shoddy journalism, coupled with one Delta operator's huge ego and one-sided opinions, make for interesting reading, but it does a disservice to the outstanding performance of our SOF warriors and their Somali opposition. It is on paper now- thus, it must be true. And, of course, several soldiers received their 15 minutes of fame and are naturally supportive of the book. Just another wannabe making a dime off the real deal."
2,"Brilliant, but incomplete book",Great descriptive book but he ignored the reasons for the battle. America had no reason to be there. Some generals should get Kenneth Starr on their tails
2,A Cool Kid's Review,This book is a definite read for all of the military buffs. I thought it was ok but it had way too many details. I wish that it could just get to the point. Some times there were points that were not important but it just kept giving details about that pointless scene. Other than that it had a pretty good plot and I like the way how it followed each different soldier's life.
4,Black Hawk Down,"Saw the movie, and then read the book. The book is better than the movie. With a son in the military, this book really hit home."
4,Not perfect but close,"I read the book after watching the movie and it's amazing how much the movie missed. While the movie is very pro-American, anti-Somalian, Bowden's book is not as biased. Bowden gives an account of the incident and also tries to insert the Somalian point of view, something the movie does not attempt to do. Aobut the only downside to the book is the numerous characters introduced. It seems almost impossible to keep all the characters straight without having a photographic memory or writing down a summary of each character."
5,Black Hawk Down,"Black Hawk DownBlack Hawk Down is powerful book. It tells the reader how hard war is. It doesn't glamorize it like other books do. It lets the reader be in the war with the soldiers. Although the book is very descriptive, it lets you see how war really is. I would really encourage people to read this book so they can see how war is. It shows how much courage, honor, sacrifice, and camaraderie. It also show how poorly former President Clinton was in operating the conflict. Mark Bowden has done an excellent job writing and telling the truth. I don't that he was biased at all."
5,Intense Drama of Real Life Combat,"""Riveting"" does not even begin to describe this book's ability to grab you and not let go. I lost two nights' sleep thanks to Bowden's non-fictional account of what must have been the worst military fiasco, fubar or snafu since ""Desert One"" during the Carter administration. You've seen the body dragged along the streets; now read about the situation that led to it."
5,Brilliant work of pure journalism,"Although given overwhelmingly favorable reviews, some note that the narrative lacks the sense of ""black irony"" present in many other war stories. I disagree. This book hides its subtlety and nuance behind chillingly stoic prose. By freeing himself from the somewhat egotistical need to analyze the battle from a modern, cynical foreign policy perspective, Bowden allows the events to speak for themselves. Black irony abounds, but it is never underlined. Bowden allows the reader to place blame; understanding, I think, that the current gap in modern journalism isn't a lack of sage analysis, but a lack of unbiased, unflinching reportage. The fact that Bowden was the first and only reporter to give serious coverage to this event bears out this unfortunate fact."
5,Black hawk down,Very eye opening to what goes on. Gives you an incredible insight to what our young men go through. Excellent read.
5,EXCELLENT,"This book is superbly written, and one quickly gets the idea that the author really did his research. My only complaint: the author tells parts of the story from the Somali fighter point-of-view, without pointing out how they were wrong for killing our men, or using their non-combatants (women,old guys,...) as shields."
4,Superbly Researched Account,"Fascinating account of an incredible ordeal that only got a few minutes of airtime here in insular America. It shows the true measure of the demands that our government puts on our soldiers, putting their lives in jeopardy for what are sometimes nebulous or even contradictory political goals. However, this book is by no means liberal propaganda, nor is it targeted against the administration of the time. It is about the other end of the spectrum of political power, and it makes heroes of young men who follow the orders from on high. The author does a nice job of accounting the events, letting them speak for themselves, with a minimum of opinionating or subjective interpretation.Bowden has certainly done his homework on this one."
4,Black Hawk Down:A Story of Modern War -the Review,"The gripping and suspensful story of Black Hawk Down by Mark Bowden, recalls the inncident of 1993's Somalia's uprising. With its carefully detailed story of how some of America's finest soldiers fought fearlessly, Mark Bowden can capture all the action in a breathtaking story. While embarking on a mission to capture one of somalia's biggest warlords, Rangers and Delta force troops get tangled into a bloody mess of combat..in the air and on the ground. With so many gun fights, some of the millitaries ""invinvible"" helicopters get shot down and a few men become prisoners of war. Page by page of never ending action, this book takes you on a wild ride through the streets of Somalia, and makes you belive that you were actually there. If you thought the movie of Black Hawk Down was great, great ready for the book becuase it is so much better."
3,The Malaysian troops,"A well researched book but it makes you wonder why Mr. Bowden didn't take the trouble to contact/interview any of the Malaysian soldiers that took part in the rescue. The Malaysian embassy in Washinghton could have provided him with some assistance. After the incident was over, numerous accusations were thrown at the Malaysian troops involved. The most common which appeared in several leading American newspapers and magazines were, "" the Malaysians were late"", ""the Malaysians weren't trained properly"", ""the convoy got lost"",""language problems"", etc. The plain and simple fact is had the Malaysian troops not arrived, more Americans would have been killed."
2,"I can see the trees, but whre is the forrest?","The author did an excellent jobs of providing the unit details, but I feel he did a very poor job of explaining the overall picture of Somolia.History Channel's presentation did an excellent job of setting the table, describing the overall mission. I had read the book beofre seeing the Hisroy Channel presentation and regretted not having this big picture. It would have only taken the author a few pages to do.I loved how he shared the Somoli citizens point of view."
5,Heart stopping. This is not John Wayne......it's REAL,"An excellent book! I couldn't put it down. I felt as if I were in the streets of MOG (all the while thanking God I wasn't)! This is a real depiction of conflict, not the hollywood hype. The men in the battle were at once brave, heroic & scared. The battle and it's events are illustrated in painstaking, if not sometimes overwhelming, detail. I have a newfound respect for the men of our armed services. How bravely they answer the call to duty. How, without question, they go to battle to defend our freedom. It is our responsibility to ensure that our troops are never put in harms way at the whim of politics. And to ensure that when they are called to risk their lives, our support should be for nothing less than OVERWHELMING force."
5,"Realism, personified. You can hear the bullet's wizzing by!","Realistic portrayal of what happens to even the best trained soldiers when politics, poor equipment selection and a breakdown in communications occurs. It also show's the skill gap between the highly individualistic Delta special force units and other less specialised US army units."
5,Excelent description of modern warfare.,"For all soldiers, old and new, and for anyone who wants to learn the consequences of our foreign policy actions, this book is superb. The action is riveting and it gives incredible insight into what combat is like."
4,Non Stop Action from Beginning to End,"This book moves at a sprinters pace and never tires. The reader gets the sense that he/she is part of the action. There is the feeling of being like a mouse on a wheel as one event leads to another. I put the book down a few times out of exhaustion.I recommend this book although, be warned, it is a troubling story."
3,The first 100 pages....,"left me struggling to keep the story straight. It seems to jump around a lot and it is sometimes hard to keep the characters straight in my head. I saw the movie first and hoped that the movie would be better as the book, as is the case in most instances. However, this may not be the case here. Being just a ok read, it now resides in the cardboard box in my basement, waiting to head over to Goodwill."
5,very good read,a chilling story about the horrors of war. makes you respect the men and women who serve the USA that much more. i would definitely recommend to everyone
4,Horrifically good book,"Great read, action packed. Some parts make you want to cringe, others make you want to cry. I will say that it can get a little gruesome at times and the violence does get to be numbing after a while."
5,Gripping,"I just got done reading this book cover to cover at the beach. What a gripping read. Although I haven't seen the movie, I did see a very nice 2 hour piece on the History Channel that Bowden participated in and included a lot of interviews with the Rangers from Task Force Ranger. I was worried it may have ""spoiled"" the book. It didn't.This is a great book that should really be required reading. For some reason, this battle has been cast as some sort of disaster for the US. The performance of the Rangers and Delta Force was amazing. What heroism!"
5,Brilliant,"As a person whose closest experience to warfare has been watching 'Saving Private Ryan' I nonetheless found this book absolutely captivating and compelling. You certainly do not have to have any familiarity with the military to apprecciate the extraordinary human drama and fast-paced narrative. I found the book to be truly exceptional in portraying the many different ways the soldiers psychologically dealt with combat and what was happening to them. All in all, a terrific book."
4,Black Hawk Down,"It's is an interesting book which captures the details of this unique battle.It was a case of military power totally misreading the ground realities nothwithstanding the bravery of the individual soldiers.However, one glaring fact that seemed to be not shown in the correct light is the crucial role Pakistani forces placed in the rescue operation.According to number of sources if the Pakistani military had not moved that quickly the number of casualties would have been much higher.Despite,not being in the picture of this operation Pakistani forces backed by Malaysian forces broke through all the road blocks to reach the trapped troops.Pakistan at time time was one of the most sanctioned country by U.S and it was perhaps politically not correct to acknowledge the extraordinary role that Pakistan army played in the last stage of this epic battle.However, now with the rediscovered friendship between U.S and Pakistan a more true account should perhaps be brought forward."
3,A dissenting opinion,"I read this book because usually books are better than movies, and I had intentions of seeing the movie. I wonder if this is a case where the movie might be better? The book seems well researched, but I found it very confusing. My assumption is that confusion reading reflected confusion on the ground in Somalia. In that sense, the book probably reflects well what happened. But, I simply could not follow the interspersed stories as they were told to the author by the soldiers involved. I wanted to understand from the maps where the individuals were, but I simply could not orient myself adequately. My guess is that the movie will also reflect this confusion and that it might be difficult to follow the story line other than the sheer confusing bedlam of the real event."
3,Black Hawk Down: A story of Modern War,"I thought that Black Hawk Down was a good book. It was kind of boring at the beginning, but after about 70 pages into the book it really picks up. There was alot of action in it. It also made you want to keep reading it. I fully recomend Black Hawk Down: A Story of Modern War."
4,Harrowing and instructive,"BHD is a truly harrpowing and deeply deatailed account, which runs the risk that the tight focus sometimes gives the impression there was more carnage than the final stats confirm, thus approximating one supposes the combat experience on the ground. The situation certainly gives food for thought in the context of current US-led NATO actions. I would have liked the author to look at the disaster from the point of view of incremental small events. IF that first Ranger hadn't fallen, if his chalk hadn't tried to evacuate him, would so many men have died? The lesson of lesadership here is not just that the staff decisions and mission planning were faulty. Some of the problems were self-created by the Rangers' creed: like the airliner that crashed while the flight deck focused on an insignificant trouble light, the Rangers' early attempt to evacuate a wounded comrade was a key tactical decision which had it's own almost inevitable role in the fatal knock-on consequences."
5,a tribute to those who gave their lives,There is much redeeming value in this read. It's a grippingaccount and a tribute to those who gave their lives.
5,Black Hawk Down: A Story of Modern War by Mark Bowden,This is an exceptional book on the true picture of modern combat. It is worth reading before seeing the movie since the movie does not get too far into character development. The movie does follow the same course as the book. A must read for those interested in military history and selfless bravery.
5,"Reads like fiction, but it's not","This book is such a fast-paced read that you won't be able to put it down. This tells the story that infuriated so many Americans back in 1993, when an American pilot was dragged through the streets of Somalia on TV. This was the pilot of the crashed Black Hawk helicopter. This story is so well written and I would gladly read anything else Bowden writes. This also tells of the extreme odds the soldiers faced against the paople of Somalia. Even civilians had weapons and were shooting at the soldiers. The American forces were grossly outnumbered. This book is one of the best I have read and I am certainly recommending it."
5,A stunning account of Mogadishu,"A superb achievement! Even though it is non-fiction, Black Hawk Down rivals great war novels like The Thin Red Line or The Triumph and the Glory for dramatic power and stunning impact on the reader. Should be required reading for future presidents, so they can understand the limits of third world peacekeeping--no matter how courageous, capable, and dedicated our troops are there ARE limits to what is possible in a complicated world."
5,Relevant Reading for Today,"I write this review for those who don't know much about the military. Black Hawk Down by Mark Bowden was an amazing read on so many levels. I say this even though I don't have much knowledge of military culture or it's jargon. The way Bowden reveals the events surrounding Oct 3, 1993 will capture your attention from the very beginning. He will tell you about the men (I mean, MEN) that couragously battled in Somalia, one by one. You will be so proud of the quality and caliber of MEN they call Rangers and D-boys. The book is also, for obvious reasons, action-packed and reads very fast. I am so greatful for this book but even more for every one of the MEN in the book."
5,Tremendous,"A true story about modern war This book is so great I want to read it again! Without saying so much, I really am intrigued about the plot in this first-rate book!"
5,Fascinating Story,"Factual story telling lots about modern military, conflict between high-tech, quick strike US forces, and lower tech Mogadishu bandits, with rocket propelled grenades, and outnumbering US by large multiples. The situation is complicated with action developing in multiple places at once on the ground, but you can follow it, even though I felt the author jumped around too often, from place to place, and person to person. It hurt the narrative flow. Also there are too many names of soldiers, and not enough characterization so you get a feel for them as individuals. But the facts are interesting and important, especially in light of Sept 11, and US probable use of high tech army in anti-terrorism campaign."
5,READ THIS BOOK IF......,"1. You want to know the Real Deal HEAT of Battle. 2. You want to understand the MEN of Special Operation. 3. You every, want to lead men in battle. 4. You're a politician, from dogcatcher up. 5. You just want to read a well written BookThis book is a KEEPER, I'm getting a Hardback as well!"
5,A great read,This is one of the best battle books I have ever read. The level of detail and the writing style is extraordinary. I had great difficulty putting the book down-I recommend this book to anyone interested in military history.
5,Never Forgotten!,All Highschool and College students must read this book. The sacrafices made will NEVER be Forgotten. Being a Firefighter/Paramedic I especially admired the dedication and heroism of all the combat medics and how they continuously cared for their fallen brothers during the thickest of battle. YOU ALL ROCK!
2,You have to have a large TV to see it,"I love that it has cool card games, but I can't see the numbers or suits easily on my 20"" TV. I have 20-20 vision and to not be able to read the cards well sucks. There's no way to zoom in on the cards that I can find either. I have messed with it trying to find the option that would allow that. None. If you have a large screen TV...go for it."
3,Not Bad,this is naot a bad game. it can be pretty fun if you have nothing else to play. i recomend you get it for the psp instead of ps2. The cool part in this game is that you can create your own player other than that it was okay.
3,Card Games,"I purchased this mainly to play cribbage. When you play in first person mode the game is slow playing. If you just want to play without all the animation, then the game is okay to play."
1,Not compatible with 2003 Subaru Outback,"I ordered this part because the Amazon garage said:This product fits your 2003 Subaru OutbackEngine: 3.0L H6 Gas DOHC Distributorless Naturally Aspirated SFI Electronic FI MFITrim: L.L. BeanFitment Notes: GENUINE INTERMOTOR QUALITYIt does not, however, fit my car. It's not even close.

5,exhaultation for Elliott's work,My favorite is the cover of Happiness. I am plenty happy to disburse the brilliance of this compilation to family and friends.
1,andrew larson's music knowledge is lacking,"Hint...Mike Felumlee is not in Alkaline Trio. However, Dan Andriano is, he's the bassist (not the drummer as you told). Therefore you are incorrect, as for the cd i dont know if it is good or bad, just sample listening to the tracks on the website or mp3's. BUT.....what i can tell you is that the Dan Andriano/Mike Felumlee split e.p. is pretty darn good. Thanks!"
3,Wishing it would have more citation styles,"The book is pretty good. Its clear and concise--straight to the point. I wish it would contain more of the different styles, but it mainly focuses on two--humanitites style and scientific style (MLA & APA). It would really help students to sort of have all of the styles in one book so we do not have to get like four or five books just because our professor wanted a paper a certain way. This book also focuses on the online citation (most books fall short of the online stuff because it is so new)."
5,One of the Best of English Drama,"This remarkable series is almost impossible to stop watching. Our family has already watched it 3 times and can easily watch it again. Always captivating, never boring, and completely interesting, even if the subject of fashion is not your favorite. This series will hold an honored place in your collection too."
2,You get what you pay for...,"On the first look, the bag is great. Small, but roomy inside. Very good deviders and great to set up the way you need for your specific camera and equipment. The material is durable and the bag looks good.Now the bad part:The closures (plastic snappers) are of very cheap plastic. They broke after only a few times using it, just by normal open and closing. (Careful handled and not over loaded).The bag is unusable and worthless without them.... A chain is as good as the weakest link...Another bad part is that this bag has no additional zipper to close the main compartment like most other bags do. This means that your equipment will get dusty even if the bag is closed.This bag would be great if they would just spend two dollars more for a better closure. As it is, I consider this bag as no good even for the beginning amateur. I am so sorry because is a very nice and extremely practical bag otherwise. Pay a few dollars more and get a better bag."
2,Very unsecure,This bag is not big deal. The form factor makes it very uncomfortable to carry around because it has a cube form. But the worst part comes when holding your stuff inside is about: The bag has a unique top cover and no individual covers for each compartment; the top handle is part of this cover which means that if you forget to lock the bag and lift it from the handle you will get lenses falling down all over. It happens to me! it is not a very secure bag.
1,Very disappointed,Tovolo Green Splash Bottle OpenerWhat a disappointment when I went to wrap this as a gift. I turned it over and realized there was only 4 magnets instead of the 6 that were suppose to be behind each petal. (Read the description)I cannot believe this is a cost saving measure. You pay good money for this little opener. For $17.00 there should be 10 magnets. COME ON TOVOLO 2 friggin magnets was going to break the bank. Shame on you. Buyer beware....... the good reviews you are reading are for the old one with 6 magnets. Another skank maneuver.
3,Have your hot glue gun ready,"Does what it does. But expect to have to reglue the magnets to the opener after the first use. You're not buying craftmanship here, you're buying cute."
5,THIS BOOK IS DA-BOMB!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This book is toooo cool!! I could read it over and over again. I thought it was interesting that somebody finally wrote about the VOYAGER crew. That somebody actually went into LOTS of detail. Thank you Jeri Taylor! The strange thing was that Neelix was dreaming about Kes, her entire life story. That was kinda Wierd. N-E-Wayz, READ THE BOOK!"
4,A lot better than expected...,"Before I read this book, I looked at book reviews from different readers. I became wary because at the time, I found that many people disliked the book, but I bought it and read it anyway. It was REALLY good! Mrs. Taylor did a wonderful job with the background stories (Especially Chakotay and Harry's). I thought that the camp situation was really interesting and I wish more would've been said about that, but I understand that the porpose for the book was to explore the characters, the camp just set the reason for telling them. This really is a book worth reading!"
1,Don't need a nitpicker to find the myriad inconsistencies,"If anybody other than Jeri Taylor -- former producer et al. of Star Trek: Voyager -- had written this, I would have one question: has the author ever actually watched the program?It's not just the little nitpicky errors (such as Tom Paris's entire background) that bother me, either. This woman has no grip on the personality traits of any of the non-human species created in the other Trek incarnations and brought forward into Voyager. We suddenly have honourless Klingons, illogical and intolerant Vulcans, etc. And none of the senior staff had a positive female role model in their lives before Janeway? Sure, sure. That's how they became so emotionally mature and competent.Star Trek is wholly fictional, of course. But this book seems to be a fiction inside a fiction: as if Taylor were living in the Trek world and writing stories about the characters for the National Enquirer. Strange days indeed."
4,A Star Trek fans delight!,"If you are a fan of Star Trek,especially of Voyager,you will thoroughly enjoy this book! The characters are brought to life and their histories,thoughts,and motivations are examined. A warning though;the story is not as light as the television show.This is a more mature Star Trek,"
5,Love the wonderful character development. Great Job!,This was a wonderful journey into the past lives of the Voyager crew. It helped me to understand the characters more completely and it was also great reading. Loved it!
3,Could have been much better.,"A big book with a nice cover, a good start. However Patways fails where it counts the most. The book tells the story of the senior officers of Voyager, as told by themselves . The stories are little books by themselves completely dismembered from the main story. There are no interruptions or questions from the other members while the stories are being told. While they are accounts of themselves, stories are told in a third person perspective. The book seems to be stitched together. Important characters don't even say a word after 300 pages! they are just sitting there, like paper characters. The stories are pretty good, the problem is how everything is put up together. There's even a gay character in this book, which seems to complicate the matter. Furthermore some characters stories do not match their TV profile (specially Kim's). Jerry Taylor could have done certainly better. It's readable, and sometimes fun, but expect nothing more."
3,Doesn't Anyone Else See It?,"No one else notices the fact that all the Senior Officers aboard Voyager have had some epic hardship about their life? Some dark secret about their past they'd rather not tell but do anyway? I know it wouldn't be very entertaining, but it seems odd not to hear some heartwarming story about a happy childhood and good life until the person got stuck in the Delta Quadrant. What's worse are the inconsistencies: In the show some tales of woe are completely ignored when they shouldn't be or proven wrong. The side plot (the camp they're forced into) is really just a gateway from one story to the next.AND there's not nearly enough of the Doctor in the book. More Doctor is needed.Otherwise it's pretty entertaining the first time around. However, I can't bring myself to read it again."
1,Way too many inconsistencies!,"Not only were the characters way off base, but their histories were terribly inconsistent with facts already established on the show. For instance... I thought Tom's accident was after he graduated, not DURING the Academy. Perhaps Ms. Taylor is confusing Tom Paris with Nick Locarno (Robert Duncan McNeill's TNG role, in which he played a cadet who covered up an accident... sound familiar?) I think B'Elanna's homeworld was wrong, too. As for the rest... well, it felt to me like the book was written by someone who didn't watch and didn't have a clue about Voyager. Not too good considering Ms. Taylor used to be an executive producer of the show.I didn't even finish reading it, and I seriously doubt that you will miss anything important if you skip this book. As a big Voyager fan, I cannot accept this as canon. Stick with ""Mosaic"". Jeri Taylor does herself proud in that one."
2,Unnecessarily verbose...,"Unfortunately, I struggled with this novel from the very beginning. The author, rather than simply telling a good story, bogs down the reader with sentences like:""In a flash, he realized that nothing had been wrong, after all, except his perception of time, distorted by his biological responses.""and...""That last remark produced no response from the people on the bridge, but B'Elanna assumed they all had a similar response: there were people who had no real home, not anymore, not after they decided to thumb their noses at the Federation's peace treaty and try for a different kind of justice.""It was just not a pleasure to read. I hate to give a bad rating to a Star Trek novel, but I just felt like this particular one was a waste of my money."
4,A little bit off...,"I have seen EVERY, and I mean EVERY episode of Star Trek: Voyager, and this book does have some things that are off. In season 7, on disc 3, the episode ""Lineage"" is about part of B'Elanna's childhood. That episode points out that her father clearly left in her preteen years, not when she was 8.Other then that, B'Elanna's is really good, prehaps thhe best one. Then there was Tuvok, the most awful, dullest, and creepest Vulcan to ever stroll the galaxy. If you read the book, do yourself a favor and skip Tuvok. Harry's lifestory was OK, not the best. Chakotay's was pretty good, for an author that is NOT a kid. If you ask me, kids have A LOT more imagination than adults. Now, kids might not make up the stupidest stories in the galaxies(like cheesy love stories), but they certainly have more of an imagination."
4,Jumpin' At The Boneyard,"Have been waiting a long time for this to be released on DVD and was not disappointed. It showed the problems facing a dysfunctional family and the lengths some people go to solve the problems. Unfortunately, this one has a sad ending. Tim Roth was superb as the one trying to help his brother through his difficulties and at the same time trying to sort out his own life."
2,Too much like a textbook,"I was really excited to get this book and very disappointed with it when it arrived. It is very dry, and presented like a textbook. For such a subject, the author takes things way too seriously, and could of had a lot more fun with this, as opposed to just presenting a dry textbook style report. Good pictures though"
4,not strapped for information,"chicago's loss is pittsburgh's gain.friedman is a great hagiographer. and while his book does not offer a real answer for his interest (i don't wish to speculate either), the text is filled to the rim with historical information and backed with exhaustive documentation.no one should read this if they want a history book version of a movie like 'opencam'. they are going to be disappointed. this is not a casual read either. but it is the perfect read if you don't want to be disturbed. no one is going to inquire about this subject matter casually.but if they do, it could be the start of an engrossing conversation!"
1,You Get What You Pay For!,"This violin is best suited for kindling. Within 2 weeks one of the fine-tuners stripped. Needless to say it is very hard to tune and it won't hold the tuning. The bridge arc does not match the fingerboard making it extremely difficult to play. After contacting Austin Bazaar (albeit after the 30 day mark) all they tell me is ""no returns after 30 days"". Buyer Beware!"
4,"Good read, but a little thin in spots...","Good story line and plotting, but a bit thin in spots. Could have fleshed it out a little more. I think McCeffrey writes better by herself. If you like the other ship stories you'll like this one, but it doesn't have the depth of other McCaffrey yarns."
4,Kensington is one of the best.,I would always buy a Kensington product over any other. Plus their stuff is always looks good. They always make quality material and this is no exception. The mouse is responsive and reliable.
5,Awesome,"Great wipers. I have only had these wipers for about a month so I do not know about the length of time they will last. But, so far I am very pleased with the quality of the wipers. The silicon really helps with keeping the windshield water free and also leaves a streak free clean. The spoiler gives a cool look to the wiper and I have not tested windy conditions but assume they will work like a charm. Overall great buy, if they last as long as people say, then in the long run they are cheaper than replacing the rainx ones over and over!"
1,Track #12 was not Recorded as it should be.,"As stated on the CD track #12 Deck Of Cards By Wink Martindale, was poorly recorded.I must say that this version of The Deck Of Cards was not Wink Martindale.Kindly review and correct.Thank you"
3,Hmmm..,"These were very tender, but too salty for my taste. They weren't as salty as the Teriyaki ones though.. :dI really LOVED Buffalo Bills Dead Meat jerkies so I thought I give these a try.. but I think I'll stick to the ones I love :)"
5,great jerky,"This is the best jerky I have ever tasted. It's flavorful, moderately soft, and not too spicy. Recommend to everyone."
2,DVD Authoring with Adobe Encore DVD,"This book may have been good in its day, however, anyone using Encore CS3/4/5 are going to be disappointed. This book is focussed on the PC version only and all the material on the DVD for following the projects is unreadable for later version of Encore, particularly Mac users. Maybe the author needs to think about taking this off the market or developing an updated edition that covers both platforms."
3,A big diretory,"This book is more than 70% a list of publishers, managers, agents etc. The list is good if that is what you are looking for. It tells if they accept unsolicted material, formats, etc.The ""how to"" aspect of the book is weak. Not a lot of material or personal stories from songwriters or publishers.If you are looking for a adresses of where to send songs, then this is the book for you."
1,Get With The Times,"I've been reading these books for the last decade... nothing has changed. They (like many major labels) refuse to adapt to today's music industry and continue to sell the same, lame stuff. Their advice is dated, their resources are still limited, the attitude from the majority of labels and managers is down right mean, and at least half won't even listen to your demo. If you feel dicouraged after reading, you're not alone. Honestly, times are changing... start your own website!"
2,not really updated,"This supposedly 2007 edition still listsnumerous publishers that accept cassette tapes! That's a laugh. Evidently the contact lists in this book have not beenfact checked in some time (like a decade).If you need a basic overview of the various ways to make money from songs, the book's ok but you can get an old version from thelibrary and it will be just as good. Don't waste your money."
3,classic pop,"the one reason to buy this is, Louise's crystal clear vocals, pure pop....Her ballads are great, this collection only has two, a cover of ""light of my life"" and the sultry ""one kiss from heaven"" . I prefer her new material it's more R&b;/ dance influenced like ""beatiful inside""...i bought this for the cover songs ""stuck in the middle"" and the 5 STAR cover (the slightest touch)...one problem i have with this colletion is the Eternal song's included, they don't feature enough of Louise so who cares..this is basically a singles collection...i own all of her cds, so i feel this colleciont doesn't really show her range...but ok for a general collection."
2,Talks down to kids and goes on and on,"It seems to talk down to kids and explains things to death. I'm only to chapter 5 and may drop it. I've been condensing chapters because my daughter is interested in entrepreneurial pursuits, but I'm ready to get rid of it.I'm giving it 2 stars only because my daughter likes it for some strange reason."
5,Every Child and Adult Should Read,My son is usually a reluctant reader yet plowed through this book. Capitalism for Kids speaks to directly to children and tells them to trust what they already know. Most children are natural entrepeneurs and need only encouragement to pursue their passions. This is a must read for parents and their children and will lead to hours of discussion. Make this a permanent addition to your library.
5,design is kind to hands with arthritis,"I've had these Felco f13 pruners for almost ten years. Even with joint replacements in my hands and severe arthritis, the grip is actually EASY for me to use. The ergonomic handles are so well designed I can usually manage most tasks with one hand but it is also easy to use two hands for bigger tasks.I also like that you can take them apart for sharpening which, to date I've never had to do so but come to think of it, I just may do that to freshen these up for the coming spring.After all these years I can say that these are built to last a lifetime.Very pleased with this purchase and highly recommended."
5,Terrific pruners!,"I've used a variety of pruners over the years (Corona, Fiskars and Felco). I got the Fiskars geared pruners for my wife a few years ago after carpal tunnel surgery. She's used them faithfully and liked them - until she got hold of my Felco 13. These are great pruners, and the extra long handles give me more control and leverage when I need it. It's a true Felco - the materials, the construction, the serviceability and the availability of parts all make Felco stand apart. In a world of mass-produced garbage that's made cheaply and priced even cheaper, it's gratifying to find quality and durabilty. I now know why my mother loved her Felco pruners in her rose garden. Now if I can only keep mine away from my wife..."
5,It grabs you and doesn't let go,"This was the first time I read Langston Hughes and I didn't know what to expect. He simply smashed me.From the first story (""Cora Unashamed"", one of my favourites), he seized me with his vibrant language, so natural, so colloquial, with his stories of deep feelings and passions, with his characters. His characters are what really grabbed me. None of these stories has a happy ending, many end on a sad note, a few come to a tragic end. And still Hughes's characters never feel defeated to me. They have a fire inside, a passion, they always meet life with an agonistic attitude, asserting themselves, fighting with everything they have inside. And so even when they lose, even when they die, they left me a sense of affirmation, even a sense of victory against all odds.An amazing reading experience, no less than that... and maybe something more than that."
5,Excellent!,I really enjoyed these stories by one of the greatest storyteller and poet there ever was. Hughes' stories are awesome.
5,Hughes Does Stories Just as Well as Poetry,"As someone who writes short stories and novellas, I was glad to have finally read Hughes' work. The Ways of White Folks is a product of its time but still a very honest look at the ways blacks and whites collide in the United States. Hughes tells stories from a variety of points of view as well as different literary styles from dialogue to letters. I'm not as familiar with his poetry as I am with his other works, but Hughes' poetry fans are sure to enjoy his full-length stories as well."
4,QUITE THE STORYTELLER,"His poetry is lyrical, even after all these years hip and it speaks to the reader, so it is no surprise that his collection of short stories does the same. Hughes had a way of preaching the truth, without telling the audience where to go."
2,Buyer Beware.,"My son wore these shoes for 13 days. The heels are already peeling off from both shoes. I expected better quality from Sperry. I expected these to lastuntil the first week in June and then the first few months of the 2012-13 school year. Maybe I just got a defective pair. The shoelaces did not seem to be very good quality either. I'm quite disappointed. However, on an up note, I would like to add that my son thinks the shoes are very comfortable. I really wish the heelwould have lasted."
3,Incorrect sizing,"This shoe seems sturdy enough, but is a lot bigger than I thought they would be. I ordered them according to the size chart, but it definitely measures bigger than what it says on the chart. And the sole doesn't seem to be very sturdy. I don't know until my son's feet get big enough to wear these shoes, but it sure doesn't seem like the soles will last very long."
3,Unisex shoes,Just exactly what we needed. These work fine for a girl or boy. Perfect with her uniform and she loves them
3,Not awful.,"Yun-hee Lee, Demon Diary vol. 3 (Tokyopop, 2000)The completion of the let's-find-Raenef backstory, and a new character is thrown into the mix when Leeche, a Lord's daughter, sabotages an offering to appease Raenef and appears in her stead. Which normally wouldn't be a problem, except that Leeche and Raenef take quite a liking to one another. Could this be the beginning of the coming forth of the prophecy that the demon world is about to change forever? Only a seemingly lovestruck Raenef knows, and he isn't telling... for now. ***"
3,Try Eerie Queerie!,"Due to the change of Authors, I was told this Manwha was taken down the `straight' path instead of the `Yaoi' path and they were right. Most of the sussness that was present in Volumes 1 and 2 is gone and what is left? Reanef excited to find out he's got a wife (even though she's only like eight). I wanted to give this Manwha a go but seeming as all the cuteness and sussness of the BL is dying, I won't be collecting or reading the rest of this series.Though don't let this review get you down to much, there is still plenty of Bishonen to oogle. But their just not after one another anymore."
2,"yo, easy with the sap!","I've got all the ALs and the last two (7 and 8) are showing a dissappointing trend. 1-6 had great lounge dowtempo tunes with good beats, and now AL 8 featuring all time sap tune 'lovin you is easy cuz your beautiful'? whaaaat, I paid for that?? that song and the 'hungry' song on disc one is a good example of what this series is turning in to.. my guess is someone else is lately selecting the music for the series that doesn't know what they're doing, well maybe they do, but take this out of the lounge section and put it in the mainstream pop sap section where it belongs. two stars cuz there are a few songs on disc two that may make it worth buying used. good luck!!"
2,Ambient Lounge 8,"Very disappointing...this is not ""ambient"" music, it's pop, ""Loving you"" on CD 1, that's old and tired and not ""chill""..their first albums were so wonderful...what happened?"
1,Very disappointed,"I was really excited when this arrived, however, I quickly became very disappointed. It has beautiful stream & bird and ocean sounds but it also has this stupid music. Maybe it's my fault and I didn't read the description thoroughly but if youwant just nature sounds, don't order this!"
4,"Excellent, BUT...","The author states in the introduction that this book is not meant for self-study and that it is expected that a knowledgeable teacher is available to answer any questions -- and, presumably, to check the answers to the exercises. This book is beautifully laid-out, clearly written, and is a joy to study -- right up until you complete an exercise and want to check your answers and find that the only way to do it is just go over and exercise repeatedly until you are sure your answers are correct. There is no other way to know. It is still a useful and productive book for self-study, definitely 5-star material, but I'm knocking off a star because of the lack of an answer key."
4,A steep learning curve,"This is definitely a comprehensive book. The author delves directly into the grammar and vocabulary, all without ever using transliterations. I had already learnt basic Hindi before picking this up, so I knew most of the script, but I could see that being a real problem. It's definitely competent. The learning curve is very steep, though, and it seems almost as if it would be better used as accompaniment to classes."
3,Not Original Versions,"Be forewarned; all songs (except one, When It Rains It Pours - The Contours) on this compilation are remakes of the original versions. If this information is important for your listening pleasure, be aware. The songs contained on this CD all remain listenable, just not the versions I remember from days gone by."
1,Buyer Beware!!!!,Buyer Beware!!!! Just from listening to the samples you can tell these are not the originals. They are decent reproductions but I am getting tired of these record labels ripping people off. If they would be up front about the content it wouldn't be so bad but this is dishonest.
2,"a fragmented look at a rich, spoiled, and wasted young man..","'The Devil Tree' is a disappointing, messy read about a young man in the early 1970s trying to piece together his life after the deaths of his mega-wealthy industrialist parents. He wanders through the drug stage, the meaningless sex stage, and forever has bouts of ""soul searching"". But unfortunately this reader found him to be so unappealing that I gradually became disinterested in him altogether. The rather choppy literary style of Kosinski, an unfortunate departure from his terrific 'Being There', only made matters worse.Bottom line: a rather burdensome and unenjoyable read."
4,A Delightful Read,The format is unusual having no chapters but rather a series of short vignetts in first and third person voices with no set sequence as to their inclusion into the framework of the story. At first I found this style to be somewhat off putting but long before the end of the work I warmed to this method of story telling. Altogether Kosinski shows us his ability to engage the reader in what turns out to be a delightful read.
2,I didn't really get it.,"The Painted Bird by Jerzy Kosinski is one of my all time favorite books, so, after reading it, I was anxious to check out another of his titles. I was disappointed with the Devil Tree. I had a hard time getting through it. I kept getting the distinct impression that it's meaning and signifigance were going over my head. I would love to hear another reader's opinion. If you came away from The Devil Tree with a different impression than I did, or you would just like to converse about it, I'd be happy to hear from you."
3,"Not exceptional, but.........","Once again, Atlantic Records opens its archives for some good little-known soul, selected by Brit Soul expert Dave Nathan.Most of this is really not that hot, but there are two really wonderful tunes from two legends of the genre. Aretha Franklin putting her stamp on Sinatra's ""My Way"" and Patti LaBelle and the Bluebells truly beautuful ""1-2-3-4-5-6-7 Count The Days."" I'm not even a big fan of Patti Labelle and I can not let this song spin on my CD player just once at a time!But other than that, buy a good used copy of this CD."
5,SPG is making their own way as artists,"Steam powered Giraffe are a throw back to a time when music was not ruled by commercial formulas that today seem to determine what music gets made. They write produce and perform what is closer to a variety show with skits between songs. I caught them by chance at the San Diego Zoo and became an instant convert. They are a great band and their music defies conventional classification, but it works with great harmonies and impressive range in their voices each also plays at least two instruments as part of the stage show. These guys are very entertaining. SPG is a small team of people that all excel at what they do."
5,Epic and So Cool~,"If you know anything (or nothing) about Steam Powered Giraffe then you should take the time to watch this film.I am one of the number of fans who have not had the pleasure of seeing SPG perform ""live"". I can happily say that this would be the next best thing! It really captures the comedic aspect with the brief but often laugh inducing intermissions.I also love that it's all live recordings. It really shows that they are quality performers! Between robotic movement and sound effects, their musical talents are unwavering. Which is saying a lot if you know how hard it is to ""pop"" and ""lock"" and not run out of breath!"
5,All around family fun,"My family and I all have very different tastes in music and movies, so to find something we can all agree on is rare. Steam Powered Giraffe is the first thing we have all agreed on in a long time. My younger siblings (in elementary school), my parents, and I (aged 21) all love SPG. It's good quality music and humor and is appropriate for people of all ages."
2,Music is good...,"I didn't make it through the entire DVD, as their humor left much to be desired. I think if you watch just for the music you could be entertained."
5,"""The Book of the Century""","Dr. Keylor portrays the political, diplomatic and military history of the twentieth century in the most understandable and straightforward language. He shows how history is responsible for what is currently happening around us, and why we should know the causes of the conflicts he writes about. He pays special attention to World War One, the rise of facism, World War Two, the rise of the Cold War, Latin America and the US, Africa, the Cold War in Asia, Israel and the Middle East, the triumph of and expansion of capitalism throughout Latin America and East Asia, the end of the Cold War, arms control and many other topics. The book is a very valuable reference for any student of law, international relations, politics or anyone else who wants to know more about the world that we live in."
3,Taking verbose to a whole new level.,"Is this an excellent analysis of 20th century world history? Yes! Genius, even! I think it presents history in an insightful, interesting way. Unfortunately, I can hardly decipher it! It uses unnecessarily complex vocabulary. The grammar, though correct, is roundabout and uses far more words than are needed to convey the points. I love a broad vocabulary when it's used to make a point clearer, but in this case, the meaning hides behind the words. I'd love a revised edition that expresses the material more clearly."
2,Put this on edown!,"""Marriage On Trial"" was quite boring. The main characters did not really confront the true issues that threatened their marriage until the end of the book. The female character was extremely foolish and weak. It is not until you read into the second or third chaper that you discover that they were only married for one day. The male character's storyline focuses on the fact that he thinks his wife really loved his father. What a waste of time. The author never bothered to explore any passion between the two characters. It was very superficial. Better luck next time."
2,A disappointment!,"At first, I liked the book. It seemed to explain Statistics simply and clearly. It also integrated SPSS well into the chapters. However, after receiving repeated complaints from my students that they found it hard to follow, I looked at it from a student's perspective rather than from someone who has studied Statistics at the Grad level.Issues:1. While the book does attempt to explain concepts simply, there is too much focus on one or two examples in each chapter and not enough background on the particular statistic being introduce.2. Oversimplified explanations such as the one provided for Related-samples t-test.3. Turgid writing such as on pp 144-145 on ANOVA.4. Quite a few typos including some wrong answers provided to practice questions!5. Students find it difficult to relate the material in the book to the wording of the Test Bank questions."
1,Horrible textbook,This textbook is horrible. My instructor decided to use this text book for some unknown reason. The explanations and examples are almost indecipherable for someone without a statistics background. There is very little information given and I left the class basically clueless. Just to get a passing grade I ended up buying another textbook to explain this useless piece of garbage. If you care about your students.... stay away!!I must add that I am familiar with math and have made As in both Trig and Calculus so it was not Statistics anxiety that caused my dissatisfaction.
1,Aweful TV tuner,"Just got this unit today and was hoping to use the TV tuner to watch football games, etc. on the kitchen table but the TV tuner is terrible. My 27"" TV in the living room does just fine picking up OTA (over the air) signals, but this little thing can barely pick up two channels and they are full of static. I tried relocating the unit in the house and pointed it's antenna around but still the picture was aweful. The TV tuner is basically worthless and is totally useless as a portable TV. The DVD player portion played fine, I thought the screen could be a little bit sharper, it seemed a little grainy for me. Anyway, I'll be returning this piece of junk ASAP and continue my search for a good portable TV. Don't waste your time with this thing."
3,dvd player ain't to good,the tv tuner is great. But the dvd player is bad. If there is even a thumb print on the dvd it won't play well. And you will get a no signal message on a blank screen every five minutes.
1,Buyer beware!,Amazon should carry ratings and warnings for DVD/video products. These movies were beyond the R ratings (which were not disclosed beforehand) and should have had an X rating. What a waste of money!
3,"WAY overpriced, Amazon!","This is a great item, but incredibly overpriced on Amazon!! I just bought these for $40 at a major bookstore right down the street. Usually Amazon is the way to go when it comes to value, but they have struck out on this one!!"
1,Wouldnt do,"Yes you get all 3 in 1 case,but tbh its a waste as you can get the 3 special editions for close to 40$ (Blu ray edition) 50$ (DvD Edition) Before you spend the 100$ look around and you'll save lots"
3,Graphic violence mars fun story ...,"What is it with Star Trek writers, that they feel a need or maybe its a secret urge to have to include some graphic violence into their story line for it to be successful. As a long time fan this is the last Star Trek novel and audio novel I will ever purchase. I would like to send a loud clear message to Simon and Schuster and especially to the current Star Trek writers that this type of writing will not be tolerated. That's the bad news. The good news is that the audio engineering is superb and has increased considerably since Star Trek Pathways. John Delancie does an excellant job with this script! He is extremely enjoyable to listen too. So with regards to audio engineering, the team is now easily on par with Star Wars X-Wing. Unfortunately stricker guide lines need to be set down for the writing team. I will no longer support your work."
1,A bad book about Q?!,I am a fan of Q and of Peter David. That is why I am disappointed about this book. It did not hold me like a good book should. The mystry was mininal and suspence lacking. Sorry guys about the bad reveiw and spelling
2,save your money,"I like John DeLancie, and really enjoy Peter David's work. 'Q' does a great job reading this story. However the story itself is just odd, long, and rambling, very incoherent. I love the character Q, but don't care of this book."
3,Disappointing reading,"Q is one of my favorite STNG characters and Peter David is an excellent story teller ,so I was eager to read this book. I find the narrative style, with all the asides and distractions ,annoying. I keep wishing they would just tell the story. Maybe Q, who is so full of himself, is not really the best narrator for this tale. Anyway, I usually finish a ST book in 2 days. This time I'm battling to finish the book. It's not exactly a page turner. Peter David is capable of much better work."
3,"Ha, Ha.","Peter David is funny. Very funny. John DeLancie is funny. Very funny. Together, such strongholds of wit ought to do very well in portraying Q as he really ought to be. Sadly, the book comes out as too absorbed with its own humor to really be the fall-on-the-floor laughing riot the authors think it should be.If you like Piers Anthony's writing, especially the later books in the Xanth series, this ought to be right up your alley."
3,Q transcends a bad story,"God becomes bored and decides that she will end the multiverse. Q sets out to rescue everything, and finds himself repeatedly bumping into Picard and Data. The storyline is confused and confusing, and the characters are pitiable caricatures of themselves.After this outpouring of scorn let me say that somehow the authors succeeded in keeping me turning the pages. There is one thing (and only one) that makes this book worth reading and that is Q himself. Peter David and John De Lancie succeed in producing a Q at his quirky best. Therefore, if you want a good story don't stop here, but if you love Q then this book is one you should check out. [Q-Squared is much better.]"
2,SHUT UP!,"This was written in first person from Q's perspective and as in the series he tends to drag on and on and on. Now, I enjoy the charcter Q but shut up sometimes. In an hour long show its OK but for a novel shut up! This could be a great story line if it was wrriten form a 3rd person view and leave out the excessive commentary."
1,"I,Quit","John De Lancie should quit writing and stay with his acting. Even with the help of long-time Star Trek author Peter David, this book left a great deal to be desired. Most books in the series either fill in background on one or more of the characters (this one didn't) or provide us with a captivating story (again, this one didn't). The story line was written as if whatever came to the author's mind became a part of the story with no concept of flow or story development. It was, at best, a jumble of concepts, vulgarities and colloquialisms which was nearly impossible to follow. Even given the somewhat unexpected ending (the only thing interesting in the entire book), the time required to read the book would have been better spent watching paint dry or grass grow."
2,You gotta be hard core!!,"The audiobook has one thing going for it. Mr. de Lancie's smoothe delivery. If you enjoy John's (Q's) voice, inflections, irony, petulance then by all means pick this up. The plot line is overworked (end of the universe), they drag a lot of old hackneyed Trek lines around, and the other characters are wooden. I wanted to end it early but That Voice kept me going!"
4,"Well, he lost a little steam at the end but overall...","Well, he lost a little steam there at the end but overall, it WAS a decent book. I laughed all the way through it and I love the Inconcievable quote he snuck in there from ""The Princess Bride"" it had me in stiches. His views on humanity make me wonder just how much of it is Q and how much of it is John. It was a very good book, but the ending could have used a lot more punch! But hey, you can't be good at everything, right? Four stars for dialouge and content. Very funny and enlightening stuff! Love ya John!"
1,Was there a plot?,"This book is a waste of money, even at Amazon's reduced price. The book is only 249 pages, and it feels padded at that length. The book doesn't have that much of a plot, and it lacks the wit of Peter David's other books like Q-Squared & Q-in-Law. I just kept waiting for the book to end. The book should never have been published, let alone as a hardcover. The book does give you a glimpse into Q's mind, but if you want Q read Greg Cox's Q Continuum Trilogy. If you read Dyson Sphere earlier this year, I,Q is like that book, only worse. I want my money back."
3,Not the Q I Recognise,"As a big fan of the Q character and John De Lancie's portrayal of the character I had high hopes for a real insight into what is essentially a living God. Unfortunately the book suffers from ""SuperMan syndrome"" where drama must be created by crippling the power of an omnipotent being.The novel starts off well, detailing the (often immoral) good times that Q has around the universe. Unfortunately the appearance of Picard, Data, and Q's ""family"" quickly curbed his fun (and mine).While there are some interesting insights into total power, Q's power is taken away from him all too quickly.What this book, and the Trek franchise, seems to forget is that Q is not a moral being, he is dangerous, capable of killing on a whim, his own hedonistic pleasure a major part of his character.It's a shame this book couldn't have had more of a devilish time."
4,A great book,I'm glad John De Lancie has finally done a book on Q. This book was really good. Especially how the character in the book was so much like the one on the tv show. I recommend this book to any Q fan.
1,"Q. doesn't believe in God, and he lets you know.....in almost every paragraph.","Q. is one of the most beloved characters on a show with nothing but beloved characters. So I got the book. Well it seems that Q. and his unique perspective is used simply as a cheap college expose on God and religion. The main characters are Q. Picard, and Data....but really its just Data and Q. So there's a bunch of philosophical expose on supreme being and robot, machine and man, creator and created. However, Q.'s usual smirks and condescending attitude has been hijacked so that the author can mock people that believe in God. I'm aware that Star Trek often tackles serious issues, but there's hardly a page where Q isn't repeating his beliefs on God, his hatred of God, the stupidity of God, and his disgust for God. I think the word God is used on almost every page. Literally! I'm not offended easily, but this seems like a hack author trying to pass off his community college 'anti-religion' thesis as a Star Trek novel."
2,definitely not David's best work,"About the only thing this book had going for it was the fact that Q was the main character. Usually Peter David's Trek novels are stellar (Imzadi, Q-Squared, and Q-In-Law were all great). I bought I,Q. with the expectation that it would be such another wonderful story. Instead, it takes a rather interesting premise and makes it into on of the dullest stories I've ever read that wasn't for Early American Lit."
2,A Rare Disappointment,"Just a short note to say how much I was disappointed in this book. I have bought all of Peter David's books on the strength of his writing but this one is a real mixed bag. It introduces Q's wife and child, which could have been interesting but they are rather boring. Overall, the book has a joyless tone which I find hard to believe in any Q story by Peter David. Maybe I expected something like Q-In-Law and maybe the tone of this book was due to John deLancie's participation. Only a few bright spots keep it from being a ""1"". I would recommend any fan to wait for the paperback or, better yet, try his Babylon 5 trilogy."
2,NOT THE BEST 'Q' NOVEL AROUND,"I EAGERLY AWAITED THE RELEASE OF THE BOOK 'I, Q' - UNFORTUNATELY, THE WAIT WAS NOT REALLY WORTH IT. AND I WAS SURPRISED TOO, BECAUSE ANY TREK BOOK THAT HAS PETER DAVID AS AN AUTHOR IS USUALLY GOLD. THIS BOOK IS BASICALLY JUST A REHASH OF Q'S TRICKERY, TORMENT OF PICARD, ETC. WHAT REALLY RUINED THIS BOOK FOR ME WAS THE ENDING. (TO ME) IT DID NOT MAKE SENSE. TO BE BLUNT, IF YOU NEVER READ THIS PARTICULAR BOOK, YOU WON'T BE MISSING MUCH. AND IF YOU DO PURCHASE 'I, Q', BUY THE PAPERBACK EDITION - FOR EVEN AT A DISCOUNT, THE HARDBACK IS NOT WORTH PAYING EXTRA $ FOR."
4,Histerical Q,"Verry funny, and a good storyline as well. See a ""human"" side to Q, and great tangents as we would expect."
2,Cute book but wait for paperback,"This was a cute enough book but not David's best. One part with the Grand Nagus is great. But Picard and Data often seemed out of character. Q's self-love and ego overwhelmed even me (a big fan of the character) at times. There were excessive and misplaced cliches, colloquialisms, and profanity, inconsistent with most good Trek. Too many speeches, too, even for a Q story. So, don't buy the hardcover; get it in paperback or from the library. In the mean time, read 'The Q Continuum' trilogy; it's a lot better."
2,"Such potential, but what happened?","I love all the Peter David ""Q"" novels, so when I saw this one I ordered it immediately. What a disappointment. The book goes off on so many tangents and trails that lead nowhere that it could have been about half the length it was. Such a good storyline, such great potential, then it all comes crashing down. Sorry, but this is not at all in the same league with the other ""Q"" novels. Let's hope there's some good ones in the works for the future."
4,A glimpse into Q's diary,"While on a ""deep sea"" fishing trip, Q stumbles across something even he cannot control. When he becomes seperated from Lady Q and q, he enlists Picard's and Data's help to find them. This book reads like a diary and is told entirely from Q's viewpoint. It's written in the first person and some people may not like that. Picard and Data may seem a bit out of character but you have to remember that this is how Q views them. I found this to be a refreshing change from alot of the Star Trek books. Overall its an amusing read."
3,"Plastic collet - pardon me, Germany?","I'll give it three stars for now, but I'm shocked that the collet that holds the blades in the haddle is plastic - outer collar is threaded metal ring, but the actual collet is plastic. It just doesn't inspire confidence. I have a hard time imagining it will hold up with a lot of blade changing or useage. Otherwise, the blades are very nice and so are the ergos.Really, Plastic?Update: after a little use the blades slip up through the plastic collet. It takes little force. Too bad. The set would have been perfect with a metal collet."
5,I wish it would just sink in!,"Great book. Nice when these type of books are short and sweet. I listen to it over & over, always picking up a new hint that I missed previousely. Just have to put into practice this logical information. I recommend it to everybody who's fading away at the moment."
2,Not for the single person,"I have several problems with this book, of which I have read enough to draw these conclusions:1) It is written in a bite-size style, because the author did not have a sufficiently coherent message to organize it properly.2) It seems to be written for a certain audience - married, assertive, overachieving middle-aged people who focus too much on their jobs and little projects, like fixing their houses. It's not a very good book for single people, who don't have a family their supposed to be investing in. If, as Carlson suggests, you let everyone else have their opinion, you're not likely to get a date, as both men and women these days are generally interested in someone with a spine! This book is not for the slackers amongst us, who need a kick in the butt to get something done."
4,awesome!,"I have just read a bookPersonal Best - How Ordinary People Achieve Extraordinary Success and How You Can Too, I've found similar themes with this book. This book is really very interesting. I couldn't stop reading before finishing it. Richard Carlson is a great writer. Not to mention a great way to remember how we go about our lives, getting all bent out of shape about things that usually amount to nothing. You may not immediately see how to apply all 100 techniques, but you'll be surprised when a sitation pops up and you remember something you read in this book. I highly recommend this book."
2,Boring,"These books have the wrong idea. It is a list of rules or something. But people don't learn from lists. Lists have to be memorized to be effective and with so many things going on with our lives, there is no time. People learn better from stories or anecdotes. That will stick. I do give it two stars because there are some useful advice found in this book...most I know but need to be reminded. I would skim through it at the bookstore and jot down the useful pieces. This book is small stuff, so don't sweat your wallet."
1,May I never read such a book again.,"A dictionary's definition of Pablum would need only a picture of this book. Pablum and this ""read"" seem meant for the same audience. Gag me."
2,Just the obvious,1% of the stuff i read in this book was worth learning for me. 30% i considered pure foolishness. And rest was just the obvious think for someone who has common sense.
2,SMART MASTER OF THE OBVIOUS,"This book only talks about what we all already know: what our teachers, parents and priests always told us and we have somewhere deep inside us. The hard part is to put it in practice, because it has always been hard! That's why the world is violent, people commit suicide, people kill each other, etc, etc. So, a smart writer put all this obvious stuff (be gentle, be patient, be nice to your friends, etc, etc...) in a book and earn millions. I don't need this book to know how to live more easily, more friendly. Anyway, I give it 2 stars because sometimes it is good to read them."
2,Impractical for the Type A personality,"Don't get me wrong - I do agree with the message of the book. However, it's only presented in a ""feel-good"" manner and has no substance regarding how to integrate this mentality into real life. It keeps shouting something to the extent of ""Don't Worry, Be Happy"" and offers no game plan. Then again, I'd find it hard to elaborate greatly on my thoughts if all of the chapters I wrote were two pages."
2,Not worth the time,OK read but offers very little to help you stop sweating the small stuff. Light hearted read. Offers simple thoughts about life.Offers very little to help someone who does freak over every little thing. Pass it up it's not worth the money.
4,self help,Pretty good book. Even if you're a fat head who thinks they're very evolved you'd like it.
5,"great book, easy reading","I wish every person in the usa, read this book. life would be so much better. i havent stopped reading this book!"
1,not worth anyones time,"I had to buy it for class, but this was an especially bad waste of time and money. I don't understand why it got published in the first place"
2,Ordinary & repetitive,"Read the book in one sitting, hoping for real new thoughts and some techniques which can be practiced on an everyday basis. While the first few pages were promising, the rest turned out to be more of the same... indeed, the repetitiveness of the messages became annoying, it was as if the author is preaching to an adult class of slow learners. Finally, I had to give up reading the book though I braved it close to the end of the book. I don't recommend buying it."
4,PRACTICAL SELF-HELP,"This little masterpiece will get you through the day interacting with terrible co-workers, road rage on the freeway, bored teenagers at home, and the mother-in-law who won't leave you alone for a minute of your leisure time. The book will give you ideas on how to deal with life's twists and turns, and will really show that ""life is an attitude - good or bad."" I like the small sections where the author talks about kindness, respect, humility, innocence, love, and living every day like it is your last. Learn that life is not always fair (to you or others) and that anything or anyone will not always live up your own personal expectations. Lighten up and ""Remember, One Hundred years from Now, There Will Be all New People."" The book has excellent ways on analyzing and dealing with stress and learning to relax. A good book full of wonderful, worthwhile advice. Carry it with you and read it casually on a vacation or an afternoon trip to the beach."
1,Don`t sweat,"Stating the obvious in an obvious way may be fine. Many of these self-help books have come and gone, and here is yet one. Richard Carlson is a likeable guy, yet this deluge of platitudes dilutes the true power of words. When we really need them, we`ve heard the obvious statements so many times that we no longer listen. Example: The misuse of the word ""love"" has made it almost impossible to use it on the correct occasions in the right way, so that the power of the word is kept. Sooner or later, one tires of facile solutions to complex questions. And this is one such occasion - sorry that it had to be your turn, Richard Carlson. Had you called your book ""Don`t sweat"" (No need to exert yourself), my rating would have been higher. It would have been a more honest statement."
4,Good book. Worth the read.,"I used to own a copy of this book. I still would own a copy of it except for the fact that I've got a bad habit (or is it a good one?) of giving things away. Anyways, the best thing I absorbed from this book was about placing things on your back burner. I read the entire book, but that was about the one thing that stuck out and really stuck about it. There's more to the book then just that, and I should go over the book again some time, and I probably will."
3,repetitive,"Some of these ideas are good to be reminded of. But this guy milked about five ideas into 100 separate items. First there's the title -- one good idea out of the way. Then there's a list of 100 ""ways to keep the little things from taking over your life"". If all the redundant ones were deleted, the book would be 10 pages long. One item is ""Become More Patient"". There's also ""Don't Interrupt Others or Finish Their Sentences,"" ""Become a Better Listener,"" ""Create Patience Practice Periods,"" ""Count to Ten,"" ""Repeat To Yourself, 'Life Isn't an Emergency'"" and ""Relax"" (which is redundant with half the book). The writing style feels a little sweet and condescending. The tips are valuable; the book is overblown."
5,Great Bood really makes you think about things,This is a wonderful book to help you look at things and see how unimportant most of them are. instead of stressing over things just don't sweat it. :o} PS> take your time a read a chapter a day and thing about it.
4,This book is worth buying just so you can share it!,"I found the book to be filled with new approaches to handling the stresses that we create for ourselves in everyday life. More importantly, my husband picked it up and read it. He is like a different man! I can't say more than that."
4,Money well spent!!!!!!,"The advice is so simple that you can incorporate it immediatley into your life. Take your time reading it, just a few chaptes a day, so that you can train yourself to recognize your usual patterns of dealing with situations/people and change it for the better. A great book I always recommend. Although, I can't vouch for the others books concentrating on Work/Home, I highly suspect this book it the only one of the series you will need."
4,Great book.,"I believe that if you are looking for inner peace and a need to find your life, than you need to read this book. I would recommend this book to people of all ages and positions. Life is to short, you need to enjoy it."
4,"Like homework, but worth it","Nothing I have ever read has made me feel more inadequate, but this book's seemingly endless list of character traits to practice and develop has given me some great places to improve myself."
1,mind candy,"A book with ""ideas"" this obvious and ""chapters"" this brief (about a page each) makes you appreciate genuine thinkers such as Deepak Chopra. Carlson's book, on the other hand, is nothing more than new-age, feel-good pablum minus any lasting benefits. I defy the reader to recount its ""thesis,"" or even recollect any specific points. Save your money. The author hasn't earned it"
2,Repetitious,"The book gave me insight on the first few chapters; some ""light bulbs"" moments. As I read passing chapter 20 or so, it seems like it is repetitiously revolving around the same idea. It is as if like a chef is presenting the same dish in different silverware and giving each and everyone different names. Nonetheless, I still like the first few chapters."
4,Don't be Type A,"This small book was a number one bestseller for it seems like forever in the late `90s. It is a collection of small bits of advice on how to stay stress free and not to ""sweat the small stuff."" It's nicely written and provides a lot of food for thought on how not to stress out over things that, in the scheme of things, are not that important. Stress causes a lot of illness and health problems, which is partially the point of the book. By following some of this sage advice one can live a healthier and happier life."
1,The essence of this book is triteness,"This book is a good read for anyone afflicted with cerebral impotence. It offers a plethora of flaccid, placid platitudes served in a casing of verbal tripe."
1,Just... Crap...,"This is a very very unimportant book which can be figured out by common sense. It is, in my mind, for simple minded kids whose lollipops just got snatched away. Not for adults."
2,A cursory good feel writing,"I didn't, found much solid stuff than just a cursory good feel writing. I was looking for real solutions but this book let me down. Sorry.."
4,Sensible and worth re-reading,"It's easy to dismiss this little book as simplistic, with its two-page chapters and ""obvious"" advice. But it focuses on basic, simple truths that most of us forget from day to day. The key is putting events in perspective: Asking ""Will this be important a year from now?"" may help you lead a calmer, less stressful life. This is a fast read, and worth reading several times."
3,"Dee Lundgren, Langhorne, PA counselor",This book is ok but not real profound. Much of the same old stuff rehashed in not so unique way. The book is broken into bit size 3 page chapters that can be read at one setting. Not really worth the price.
3,Part Way Through It,"I am still reading ""Don't Sweat The Small Stuff --and it's all small stuff"". I have since learned there is one for ""family"" and ""work"", that I am interested in reading."
5,Excellent read and excellent condition,"In keeping with Don't Sweat the Small Stuff"" this book continues to be a motivational addition to my collection. It was worth me sweating to find an inexpensive copy."
4,This book made me see my life a different way,"If you sometimes have the blues, think the world is unfair or don't understand the people you have to deal with everyday, read this book. Every other sentence, you will remember acting the same way it is explained and you will find ways of letting go your insecurities and you'll gradually transform yourself into a more calm and happy person. Even if the books has more than 200 pages, I wish there was a chapter for everything that can happen in life. Who said life didn't come with a book?"
1,Over hyped,"Most of this book contains obvious information and content lifted from other books on the same subject. The book is only 2/3 the size of a standard sized paperback and its chapters are only a brief essay per page, so can be read quite quickly. The book received much success from a clever TV marketing campaign but offers nothing unique to the reader.Even the title: ""Don't Sweat The Small Stuff...and it's all small stuff"" was not a coin phrase invented by Richard Carlson but stolen from a far better book on stress, 'Is It Worth Dying For?: How To Make Stress Work For You - Not Against You' by Robert S Elliot, first published in 1984. Save your money and buy this one instead."
3,good if kept in perspective,"This book is very good in regards to the ""small"" things in life that need to be kept in perspective. However, those who have jobs involving the live and safety of people (medical and public safety - fire, EMS, police) had better keep sweating the small stuff, because someones life depends on the ""small stuff"" that you have to keep track of. At the same time he offers good advice on how to relax and keep like in perspective. He just shouldn't believe that everything in life is ""and it's all small stuff""."
1,The Emperor's Clothes,"What this flimsy ""book"" (one page=one chapter) offers is simply an opportunity for readers to confirm their own suspicions about what should matter in an overly-crowded individual lifespan. There is nothing here that an individual of average intelligence and average writing skills couldn't come up with on his or her own. In fact, having read the book, you're unlikely to remember any of its cliches', banalities, and truisms. If, on the other hand, you took 5-10 minutes a day to write down the things you value in life, you would be much the wiser."
4,I enjoyed this because it is simple but effective info.,"Through basic ideas and examples, the author managed to give advice on how to get through life without fretting about the details, without obsessing about mistakes we make. Most people would benefit from this book."
5,Don't Sweat the Small Stuff,I was extremely pleased with the condition of my order. The swiftness with which I received it was also excellent I would order from this vendor anytime !!!!
4,"A book with a calm, peaceful tone for rushing people",I think people gain most from this book if they read it slowly and gradually absorb its content And most important of all put it into use in their daily life.I think the book is best suited for high acheiving people who're always on a rush. It helps slow you down. But for people who don't live a very fast paced life I don't think this book will help as much.As a Buddhist I see lots of Buddhism concepts here and there in the book. Overall I'd say it's a good book for people who want to better their being.
5,"wonderfully inspirational, Goes along with my 12 steps","I truly love this book and continue reading it as a guide for life. It has the spiritual aspect that goes along with my 12 steps of recovery.It depicts how I can lead my live with a degree of comfortability by doing simple things to improve the quality of my existence. I am very grateful to know that the small stuff is just that, ""SMALL STUFF"". I believe I can live a long, full and rich life if I have faith, believe in God, and concentrate on the IMPORTANT things, like family, friends and people who need help."
4,Liked it,"I liked the book a lot, but some chapters towards the end were just repeating the ideas from the chapters in the beginning. All in all, I would definitely recommended the book."
3,It really helped,"Each chapter has influenced my thoughts, emotions and behaviour. I was really frustrated with my life and this book has changed my outlook on life..."
4,It is a wonderful book to read when you are overwhelmed.,This book is very well written and is particularly good to read when you are feeling overwhelmed. While not everything can be broken down into easy to handle bites of life it does give you a good grasp on how to prioritize and look at what is most important.
4,"This is an inspirational, handy, user friendly little book.","This small book can be picked up and read with ease at any spare moment of the day. Each chapter takes around 2 minutes to read and contains a clear, simple and accessible message.These are geared to slowing down the pace of our lives, getting us to be calmer, happier people. I would recommend this book to all my friends."
5,Good book to tuck in your briefcase and read time to time,"Lots of tips, philosophies(sp) and ideas for leading a more centered, focused life"
2,Too Technical!!?!,"This was on sale, so I was enticed to buy it for my precocious 2.5 year old who went to lots of baseball games with her grandparents. I should have looked at the playlist. The first track is the ""Casey at Bat"" poem, it was pretty good! The second track is ""About the Poem"" huh????? The third track is ""How to Listen to a Story in Music"" The seventh track is ""Maestro talks about the music"" The either is ""Now that you know a little More...One more Time"" Perhaps we will enjoy this more when my kids are 10 or so, but it was dry, intellectual, technical...and sort of ridiculous. Well, I am not one for over analyzing literature in general, and I didn't find this intellectual analysis at all compelling. This could possibly be helpful to a home school family, but it certainly won't be the CD to enjoy good poetry presented with music. Kinda bewildered.."
2,"Good technology, bad components",When it works it's almost perfect - roof down car conference calls that can hear me when I whisper. components and build quality are terrible as well as repair work. You can depend on it breaking.
3,EH.,really solid -- just not good enough for the money.for 1/10th of the price:Plantronics MX500i 3-in-1 Headset -- so clear! great listening and talkingJabra C510 Corded Headset - nice n loud -- a touch muffled but nice volume.
2,Failure,"I got this specificaly to use with my jar, not bottle, of lotion. Unfortunately each time I dip my fingers into the jar it pushes it down until the jar falls out through the bottom. Poor design! Completely useless unless 8 oz. bottle is used."
2,No Bottle as advertised,"This was advertised as it came with the bottle, it did not, but the packing slip said the color will be changing and no bottle will be included. Kind of late. I would not buy from bebeautiful again. I would send it back but they will not pay for the shipping even though what I received was not what was advertised."
5,Great!,We love these! They teach about different topics & how to draw the cute corresponding picture. Definitely recommend for fun or study.
5,Love these books,I bought these books for my granddaughters and we have enjoyed them together. It's a wonderful way to encourage young artists to expand their talent. My daughter is a teacher and is excited to use them also.
5,learning,"I homeschool my kids and love that there is book that teaches interesting topics and drawing. It is perfect because the wording is not boring for the older kids, and not too detailed for the younger kids. They love to learn and draw."
5,Awesome drawing,"We love these books. We home-school and have been using these books since the beginning of the school year. My two boys are older, 3rd and 5th grade, but we still use this to practice cursive writing and to work on basic drawing skills. It has really helped the boys to break down their drawing subjects in simple shapes. The kids really like the animals in the last few books. We would recommend these for any family."
5,Great learning tool,These books are a great learning tool. It is fun to write and draw with my daughter. She is learning sentence structure because she is writing with me more often.
3,Very good... except....,"This album is great except.....they cut out Whitney's last two notes when she went up on ""I Will Always Love You"". That is unforgivable and it was her biggest hit - the song she is most known for. Every time I listen to it, I get upset. Who could be so uncaring to do such a thing. It's very noticeable that they cut out the ending. What could be gained by doing that?!! Be aware, if you buy this album, the end of her song is cut."
4,Soothing music,"Bought this CD for a friend and decided to rip it on my own computer. Glad I did as this is the epitomy of what Whitney was able to do prior to her decline in to drugs, etc. Wonderful album just to sit back, relax and listen."
5,Love Whitney,I love this CD. This is not a shake your booty CD. This is Whitney from the heart. This is Whitney with the golden voice. Love and miss you Whitney.
2,"Love, Whitney AGAIN?!","Okay!this cd could be a great album but is poor!everyone that have GReatest Hits should not buY this album, cause is not necessary!!Shame on ARISta by making this album, SHAME On LA REID for making this album. Most of all this is not a good compilation.1 most of all the songs appears on greatest hits album2 a Romantic album and don't have Greatest love of all?!3 only one song from My love is yOur Love?4 no unrealsed tracks neither extras?5 only 1 song from the preacher's wife?WHY the hell they didnt put new songs?BAH!this album is just for the fanatic fans, like me, or for those who might not have the Excelent Greatest Hits.Buy Greatest Hits, that is a good compilation of Whitney's, the best singer ever, not this..."
2,Something is very wrong...,"The Audio-Technica ""Type"" Replacement Stylus that I purchased has never performed properly. I'm 95% sure the metal connections that are supposed to be touching the magnetic cartridge are not touching properly. One channel was absolutely horrible. I threw it in the trash."
5,Most important book I have read,This is by far the most dynamic book that I have ever read. It started changing my life before I had even finished it. This book should be required reading for anyone who wants to improve their life.
2,"In this case, the workbook is better than the book.",I agree with the reviewer who said Dr. Phil excels in one-on-one strategizing. The workbook for Life Strategies is much more worthwhile and understandable because it forces you to relate what he's saying to your specific life experience. I look forward to the TV show.
1,Nothing New Here,"Frankly, I don't understand why this book got so many raves. I found it unbearable. The book consists of ""new-agey"" statements of the obvious intermixed with demonstrations by the author of his own self-importance. I'm sure McGraw is a great trial strategist, but as the ""life lessons"" contained in his book are nothing but common sense, I fail to understand his special qualifications as a ""life strategist."""
3,For the career person,"This book wasn't for me. I am a 30 year old stay at home mom and I was looking for something to help me get the courage to go after my dreams. But, instead, I only felt like it was geared toward those looking to be more successful in the working world. I work (hard) just not outside the home. But if you are stuck in a dead end job, with your life on hold, this could be the book for you. I always thought Dr. Phil was awesome in his no nonsense approach, and this book is no exception. He cuts to the chase in saying that what matters now is what you are going to do with your life presently. I gave it 3 stars because it didn't help me personally, but for someone else it might."
2,Eh,"Despite being embarrassed to buy this book (I felt like a loser handing it to the cashier), I bought it anyway because I like Dr. Phil's show--he's entertaining. However, I didn't find this book nearly as helpful as Wayne Dyer, The Secret or Eckart Tolle. I didn't take anything away from it, and I wish I had bought something else instead of this book. Sorry Dr. Phil! I still love your show and that brilliant masterpiece, Dr. Phil House."
4,This audiobook is definitely worth listening too.,"This audiobook is filled with great no-nonsense, cut-to-the-quick strategies for getting on with your life and ridding yourself of useless, old, burdening baggage. I would have given it 5 stars had it gone into a little more detail. This is one of few audiobooks where the author actually does a good job of narrating."
5,A Must-Read!,"Phillip C. McGraw, Ph.D., better known to Oprah Winfrey fans as Dr. Phil, has popped out a refreshingly in-your-face contribution to the self-help genre that doesn't beat around the bush. You will not be asked to commune with your inner child or vent your anger and pain. Instead, Life Strategies is a prescription for action, complete with stories, including about Oprah. Each chapter contains at least one writing assignment, designed to stimulate honest inquiry and to challenge even your most basic assumptions. These culminate in a meticulously detailed set of instructions for creating your life strategy. Organized self-starters will love the lists and matrices, but even readers who don't plunge into the assignments will gain fresh insights into their behavior. We from getAbstract prescribe this bouncy book to anyone seeking a step-by-step plan for self-assessment and realistic life change. Cynics need not apply."
3,Down home wisdom,"A lot of what Mcgraw writes is just plain common sense said in his own bumptious but occasionally preachy way.The book is rather short and to the point.All the vague and pompous nonsense usually habitual in books of this sort is thankfully absent here.Mcgraw is a good coach,but it is up to you to follow through with the recommendations and lessons,otherwise you'll just wind up buying another self help book next week."
2,Tired of the Cheerleading,"Slow reading. I was always impressed with Dr. Phil and his discussions on OPRAH, but found the book rather disappointing. He does give a good 'in your face' account of what you need to do in order to perform a Life Strategy. However, I found some of the pages with sentence after sentence just telling you over and over what you need to do but not providing any specifics for the reader on how to actually start doing it. Also felt that the book contained quite a bit of grand standing on how he helped Oprah win her mad cow disease legal case. That grew old very quickly."
5,"Great book, must read for anyone","10 lessons of life, simple but elegant way of summarizing your life's journey!You either get it or you don't, be one of those that do get it! Since I read this book, I keep thinking about this phrase over and over again.Life is managed not cured! How appropriate.Mr. Mcgraw's book makes you think and dig deeper.Highly recommended."
5,"Physician/""brain-author"" sees this as practical truth...","Saw this book on the best seller list for Amazon and ordered it. Was very impressed with Dr. McGraw's command of human nature and his pragmatic approach to dealing with the deck of cards given to us by life. For pragmatic stuff on the brain, try ""The care and feeding of your brain"" if I may (the author, Ken Giuffre MD)."
5,Take Charge of Your Life!,"I really enjoyed LIFE STRATEGIES by Phil McGraw! Great Book! I really think that there are some very potent insights and principles that Dr. McGraw presents in the book.It really helped me become more effective and accomplish more. It also help me get some insight on how to get out of some unproductive habits I had. I also feel like I can take on more challenges than I could before. I really like his no nonsense approach to things.Other books I love and highly recommend are:* ""Habits of Highly Effective People"" by Covey* ""Working On Yourself Doesn't Work"" by Ariel & Shya Kane* ""The Power of Now"" by TolleI especially loved ""Working On Yourself Doesn't Work"" by the Kanes. It is a great book, simple yet with gems of insight. Reading it has really made a big difference in my life! These are all great books I recommend to readers seeking solid, practical yet profound advice on how to be happier, more effective, and more fulfilled in life!"
2,I wish I had not wasted my money,"I was suprised at the high average rating this book has. All I got from the book was feeling like I had a large cheerleader saying ""go for it - compete - winning is EVERYTHING - no matter what the cost...You must have a goal & win or your life is no good"". What about the journey? What about stopping to smell the roses?? I got tired just reading his book! ""His"" principles are good common sense. I was reading it going, ""and yes? Your point is what? Nothing new here"". I have worked very hard for a very long time & have learned that it is the journey that counts. And that you DO NOT always have control over what happens to you. Only in your perception, and response, and attitude."
5,"Phil tells it like it is, always...","If you are not lucky enough to catch 'Dr. Tell-It-Like-It-Is-Phil' on Oprah then you should at least read his book(s). There isn't any 'sugar coating' in this book, he is candid, real, thought-provoking and honest. This book offers you a chance to look at your own role in relationships more closely and see what you are doing or not doing that contributes to your experiences. You are in charge of your own life and all that is in it, Phil will remind you of that. He says, ""Life is not cured, it's managed"" and ""You teach people how to treat you"" and he is right on both counts. This is a very powerful book and a great life guide for taking a humbling look at your life."
1,Let's be honest....,"us 'self-improvement' junkies are suckers for books like this no matter how many times we keep hearing the same old advice. We're searching for that magic formula that just doesn't exist and this book - like most others of it's kind - is the same recycled, repackaged jargon. Deep down we all know what we need to be successful - a solid idea of what we truly want and the discipline to work towards making it reality. If you already know this there's no point in buying this book."
5,Dr. Phil's book keeps it real,"This book was bought for my neice. I already had it and believe me, after you read the first two chapters you know this book isn't just a lot of mumbo jumbo. Instead of giving you reasons why your life is messed up it actually helps you evaluate your life where it is at right now. You'll gain insight about your behaviors and how they affect your decisions. You'll understand how you invite people to treat you the way they do. It's not all roses but it's great information if you really want to make a change in how your life is going. There are so many ""well, duh..that makes total sense!"" moments in this book! It's a great read. I also have the workbook (which really is a WORK book)."
4,A provocative and challenging book of practical strategies.,"This book is a valuable contribution to no-nonsense literature that focuses on personal change strategies. The author has compiled a compendium of life strategies that are articulated in a clear and persuasive manner. The language and ideas expressed are plain and simple yet very compelling. It is unfortunate that this most interesting book is devoid of reference notes, bibliography, or appendices since attribution would be helpful for further study of source material. I would recommend this book to anyone and like others will look forward in anticipation to more and equally original work from this author."
3,"Some good stuff, some so so stuff.",Listening to this and applying what you get out of it will improve your relationships with people.
2,Pah.,"This book is a collection of soundbites. As another reviewer said more eloquently, the book wallows about, contradicting itself, making unsubstantiated claims, and occasionally foaming over with nonsensical palaver.But I'd still give it a marginally passing grade because there's a kernel of wisdom that deserves much wider recognition. McGraw says that each of us is responsible for what we do (and 'doing' includes feeling and reacting).Yep. And I do believe quite a few of us would rather not take responsibility for ourselves. We'd all be better off if we did this more broadly. A new concept? Hardly. But still, important."
4,"""TELL IT LIKE IT IS"" DR. PHIL","What I appreciate most about Dr. Phil is his straight ""tell it like it is"" approach in his writting and his appearances on Oprah. When a couple or any individual are doing something that's not working for them Dr. Phil is there to guide them to a starting point from where they can take a look at what's not working and from there have an opportunity to transform their lives.I noticed another reviewer recommending the book "" WORKING ON YOURSELF DOESN'T WORK"" by Ariel and Shya Kane. THANK YOU FOR YOUR RECOMMENDATION TO A GREAT BOOK!THIS IS THE BEST BOOK ON PERSONAL TRANSFORMATION I have read. The Kanes' book is a practical, easy to read, insightful and humorous guide to my own self discovery and as the title states without working on myself. My life, including my work and relationships, has become and continues to be much more fun, satisfying, and rewarding.I too whole heartedly recommend the Kanes' book to anyone interested in having A WONDERFUL AND SATISFYING LIFE."
5,"Straightforward, No Nonsense!","""Life Strategies"" is one of those rare finds, a self-help book that does not wallow in big words or esoteric concepts. Mr. McGraw outlines his steps for success in life in simple, direct, yet engagingly written chapters. The organization of the book is excellent throughout and reflects an author who has had extensive experience in dealing with people from all walks of life. He deals with concepts such as self-reliance, individual responsibility and similar notions often downplayed (or ignored outright) by other authors seeking to play into the culture of victimization. You will find none of that in Mr. McGraw's book; his main theme is that we are responsible for our own lives.Once you pick up the book, it is difficult to put down; you will find yourself nodding your head at what you have always known in your heart, but do not always acknowledge in your daily life."
2,Save Your Money - Read the Back Cover,"While this book isn't terrible, it is unnecessary. Certainly it's unnecessarily long. It would have made a great pamphlet."
3,This is a book about Oprah Winfrey,"I was disappointed that so much of what he writes about is directly related to Oprah Winfrey's court case in the South. I cannot separate Oprah's $30 million salary from how ""real"" she is, according to the author. Oprah solved her problems with ""real"" money. Tough to relate my ""reality"" to hers. But there are some common sensible tips in the book if you have the patience to sift through all the ""I'm friends with Oprah"" stuff. It's not the kind of book that I couldn't put down. I put it down several times and skipped a lot of words and still got his point. My advice: Borrow the book and read a few chapters here and there. It's not a masterpiece."
1,Worst of Breed,"This is, of all the ""self-help"" books I've ever seen, the weakest by far -- dashed off, flip, and wholly derivative. If it took McGraw more than a weekend to slap this together, he was as bored with it as I am.Try Tony Robbins. He actually tries to put together books that people other than himself may benefit from. McGraw intermingles the glib with the cliched. Terrible.""Awaken the Giant Within"" has actually helped people. This book, however, is simply a let's-make-a-quick-buck-on-my-fame disappointment."
1,Pernicious new age nonsense - signifying plenty.,"I am sure that new age ""psychologist"" McGraw is ""getting it."" Plenty of it. You can count it. Ain't it all grand?"
5,Get the Message: Straight from the Shoulder,"Self-help books vary a lot in two areas: How much specific direction the book gives you (most give principles and not much detail) and how directly they address the problem (usually authors avoid being blunt). LIFE STRATEGIES is good in both of these regards, and gained my respect and attention. I could use it to make immediate life improvements. I found LIFE STRATEGIES also refreshing in that it was not filled with self-congratulating personal success stories like a lot of these self-help books are. Because of the range of principles and issues that LIFE STRATEGIES addresses, I would recommend this book to anyone who was functioning without regular psychiatric help. If you only read one ""change your personal life for the better"" book this year, read this one. If you want to learn even more about making better personal decisions, read SMART CHOICES. For good advice on how to rouse yourself to make a change, read WHO MOVED MY CHEESE?"
4,This book is good for someone who needs to face reality.,It's a book that can help you to understand why you do the things you do. As you read you will come across parts that remind you of others around you. It will make you want to run out and give this book to people that you know. If you've ever watched Dr. Mc Graw on Oprah you will appreciate his humor in the book. I know I laughed quite a few times while reading. It's interesting as well as heartbreaking. He talks about his experiences and people that he has treated. This is one self help book that everyone can benefit from. No matter how normal you think you are.
1,"if you're into self improvement, this book is real waste of time and money.","This book is full of that kind of phrases that a self improvement newbie likes to hear. To show that he is a credible man, Dr. Phill begins his book by the story of the trial of Oprah Winfrey against the cattlemen in Amarillo. I read the book from beggining at the end more than one time to realize at the end that it is really waste of my time and money.If you don't know Anthony Robbins, please look at his books and audios. He is far beyond the level of Dr. Phill futile advices, and he is man who really cares about people.Hope I did help with this modest review.All the best!"
4,Life changing.,"I have read the book and presently I am taking the time to do the recommended exercises after each Lesson of Life. I enjoy the book and have incorporated a number of life's lessons in my own life. The results are remarkable not only in the behavior of others but also in my attitude. I awake each morning with a purpose instead of barely crawling out of bed. I can not speak for anyone else, but this has truly been a positive experience for me."
1,This book beats the same message over and over,"I did not learn anything I did not already know. I thought the point of the book was to help you set a strategy for your life, but there is a strong assumption that your life is off course. My life is not off course, I am not making poor behavior choices, and I do ""get it"" already. I want to have a stronger strategy and direction, but I'm not sinking or sunk as his writing implies. I'm told over and over how I need to take responsibility (I aleady do! ) and how I need to see the real truths (I already do! ) etc. I feel like I was preached to, but I don't need converting. It was an annoying waste of time. Only people whose lives are screwed up should buy this book - not those of us with good lives looking to make them better."
2,Disappointment !,"I found this book quite disappointing. It's not as good as it sounds when Oprah Winfrey talks about it. It's her shows about the book that are good, not the book itself. Some bits are quite useful but I find it really strange when Dr. McGraw ""attacks"" some other self-help approaches implying that his is the only real one. Throughout the book you have a feeling that he thinks he is the only one who knows the meaning of ""get a life""."
2,I bought it twice and returned it twice,"...To sum up: I think the author have a few good points on life laws and strategies, but if you were like me, you may find it very hard to continue reading the book to eventually get it all &#65533; there are many ill-written and unedited sentences and the author tend to elaborate, if not exaggerate, his points, both of which could be very annoying. Also in some case it doesn&#65533;t seem obvious how to implement/activate the suggested strategies. But, hey, it could just be me who really didn&#65533;t and perhaps couldn&#65533;t get it."
1,Setting Mental Health back to the stone ages,"In this book this man makes statements that sells books. He says people just need to take control of their life. I'm sorry, but the mind is a little more complicated then Mr. McGraw would like you to believe. There are a broad spectrum of illinesses and problems with the brain that we haven't even begun to find, so when Mr. McGraw suggests that children are being diagnoised as HDD instead of being called a spoiled brat and swatted on the bottom, then apparently he has never met my son who suffers from frustration, anger, and low self-esteem. This man is about money, don't be fooled, some people need help and this man is forcing them back into a closet of guilt."
4,Good book with a note,"You know, it doesn't matter how good/bad this book is, it doesn't work for everyone. Everyone has an opinion. This book or any book gives you ideas, directions and it's up to you how you apply it to yourself to make yourself feel better, and maybe make a difference in someone's else life or whoever or whatever. If you think the book is all about oneself, manupulating and cheating others, maybe you should buy and read a book called ""How to think postive and be good to oneself and others"" and reexamine yourself before you even read the book. There are many people who read this book and want to use it to enhance their own life as well as others'. Take what is good and disregard what's bad, but again it's up to you how you percieve it."
1,Do not buy this product,"Air conditioner broke after 6 mo. Just try and get parts. If you call the 1 800 number,( THIS IS THE FACTORY IN CALIFORNIA) you get a recording,saying you can hold or leave a message and they will call you back. I am still waiting for that call. So I held on for the hour and a recording come on saying you can not reach this party, please leave a message. I did. Still waiting for that call too.I thought it might be a glitch in there hone service. It is not. Same thing, wait an hour and a message will come on saying you can not reach this party, leave a message.YOU CAN NOT GET PARTS FOR THIS UNIT!If you have $550. dollars to throw away. Buy it and six months later throw it in the trash and go buy another brand.It is not just me. Do your research and you will find this is not a good product.MANY OTHERS ARE HAVING THE SAME PROBLEM."
5,SIMPLY THE BEST OF ITS KIND,"THIS BOOK IS THE BEST, MOST HELPFUL, CONCISE, WONDERFUL BOOK I HAVE EVER READ ON THIS SUBJECT. DR. PHIL GETS RIGHT TO THE POINT WITH KINDNESS, CLARITY AND SIMPLICITY. THERE IS NO PSYCHOBABBLE, NOR IS ANY NEEDED."
3,"The book was ok, but how do i get tickets to his show!?","Although I'm a huge fan of Oprah and Dr. Phil, having purchased this book, I can safely say, tough love only works when Dr. Phil is present. I read the book, did all the exercies and still found myself absolutely depressed. It wasn't until I started therapy that I could safely put Dr. Phil's advice into my own perspective. It's not that Dr. Phil isn't a good writer, or that his exercises don't help, it's just hard to make a true impact from the written word. Worth a read, but my advice, save the bucks and see a counselor instead."
3,Keep your eyes open and play an active role in your life,"The point of this book is to tell you to actually decide what you want out of life and to go after it. You will find a way to obtain it-just be proactive. No one else's opinions matter, just put those thoughts on the sidelines."
1,simple to a fault,"I listened to the tapes in my car and only my stubborn nature, and hope for something better, kept me going to the end. It is so simple, it's unbelievable. No tips, directions--NO ANYTHING. Suck it up, work hard, you reap what you sow. You have now read the book-heard the tapes--there is no more."
3,"An ok book, but I expected better.","This book was ok and contained some good thoughts, but it did not live up to my expectations. I was expecting much more given its billing as a best seller. Too wordy, somewhat boring in parts - there are better books out there!"
2,"Bland, Recycled Advice; Better Options Available","This is not a bad book, yet much of the wisdom is very similiar to Wayne Dyer and other pop psychologists. Dick Sutphen's superb ""Reinventing Yourself"" is a much better choice. Mr. McGraw is a dynamic speaker, however, this book is too long at over 300 pages in paperback and occasionally loses its focus. Someone new to reading psychology books will probably be impressed with this work, I observed strong similarities to Dyer, Nathaniel Branden, and others in McGraw's book. Now his son has authored his own self-help book so this has become a family franchise."
5,This book can change your life,"Dr. McGraw forces us to look deeply within ourselves to find the sources of our problems and behaviors. At times, this can be startling. This book can change your life if you are willing to accept responsibility for your decisions. Once I was willing to face my fears and suppress my ego, I was able to grow as a member of society. As a teacher, I have used much of the information contained in Dr. McGraw's book to motivate them towards better learning."
5,A MUST read!,"This is the best self help growth book I have ever read. Dr. McGraw's no nonsense approach to personal responsibility is refreshing and very much needed in the ""victim"" oriented world in which we live. The book is full of practical assignments to help get to the root of why we are not being as effective as we would like to be.I wish I could afford to buy a copy of this book for every person I know!"
2,But how do I get the million dollars?,"I was reminded (when I read this book) of the old Steve Martin joke... ""I can tell you how to get a million dollars tax free. First...you get a million dollars....."" In the same way Dr. Phil promises that all we have to do is figure out what is blocking us....what prevents us from attaining our goals, and we will be able to fix everything. I never made it to the ""fixes"" 'cause I don't know how to figure out what the problems are. If I knew that, I probably wouldn't need the book! There was really nothing concrete or useful for me in this book. A shame really, because I like Dr. Phil and appreciate his no nonsence style. But if I can't get the million dollars, the info on the tax break ""ain't"" gonna help me one bit."
3,If you PREFER RESULTS WITH YOUR GOOD INTENTIONS....,"If you want to do what works AND what matters, get and use The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People by Stephen Covey and Awaken The Giant Within by Anthony Robbins. These two, combined, cover every thing you actually need to create...really create what you want for your life. I used these volumes to help myself and help others help themselves to create worthwhile directions and results where it counts the most, in our lives."
1,"If it don't hurt, it ain't workin'","It has puzzled me for some time why people could possibly regard this book, as banal and unimaginative as it is, could achieve best-seller status. But then, I wondered the same thing about some other books - like Covey's ""7 Habits"" and Johnson and Blanchard's ""Who Moved My Cheese?"".And then it clicked - some people LIKE to beat up on themselves. Somewhere along the line (from a certain kind of parent, perhaps, or a certain kind of teacher?) they learned that IIDHIAW - ""If it don't hurt, it ain't working"". Or as Jane Fonda put it: ""No pain, no gain"".And some people have captured that message and turned it into a book.Well, this is one of those IIDHIAW books. And readers who believe that pain is the only effective teacher will love this hidebound set of instructions on how to live their life.Readers who enjoy average to high self esteem, on the other hand, will most likely hate it!"
1,Much too basic and limiting,"There are three flaws in his approach.First, he makes the individual stop thinking about others, and encourages them to focus only on themselves and their own life. The correct appraoch would be to help readers focus on themselves AND other people, to live life in concert.Second, this prevents the individual from seeing the larger framework of social activity, of which they are a single player. You don't make change through brute force, but through subtle and consistent attention to pressure points, after recognizing what they are.Third, if I took his advice, I would be unhappier than ever. You can't make people feel comfortable with pain and suffering just by telling them that they have to deal with it. Pain is never a given. It is simply a result of bugs in the social network. His assumptions doom this book to failure from the beginning, because it springs from his own harsh view, which isn't accurate or objective."
