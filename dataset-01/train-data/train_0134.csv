5,exploring the craft,"i am suprised at all the criticism this book got. i became wiccan 10 years ago and this was my first book, and ""bible"" so to speak. i wanted to come on here and let everyone know how truly great i thought this book was, even for a beginner. yes, there are some ""darker"" spells, but i just skipped over them and made due with what i could. i'm sure this book might have actually helped people find their path better, because it wasn't all fluff. there are great things in there like charms and what they represent. theres mojo bags, spells, potions, even dream meanings. a little something to make you want to explore the craft further. i found this book to be one of the most explorative when i first started, and it's still one of my favorites today."
4,Great spellbook for all occasions,"This book contains spells for almost any occasion. Beware though, some of the spells seem kind of unethical to me, but then again you can always alter them. Contains folklore, charms, and a few potions. Some of the spells are only a couple of lines long but the whole page is devoted to that one spell. Seems kinda like a waste of paper to me. Overall a good book for spells but if your looking for a religious experience, look somewhere else."
4,Great information,I found this book easy to read and follow. I found it had good information. I originally bought this book for my daughter but find myself borrowing it for ideas when I get spell block. My daughter and I alter some of these spells but found it to be informative and helpfull. Not to be taken lightly though.
1,Not Worth it,"I found this book disappointing.. Gladly, it wasn't my first book on Wicca. I had been taught through Scott Cunningham's books (which I highly recommend) and Ms. Dunwich's book did not meet my standards. If you're interested in practicing just folk magic and not into Wicca, I guess I could say this book's for you."
5,Wiccan Spells,"}i{ i like this book because, i am wiccan and t tells alot about wicca and gives you many, many, spells...... i lso like the fact that is in 100% english not with all these terms that are hard to understand! i think its a excellent book! }i{"
2,A tapioca-and-ketchup type of book,"This book reminds me of tapioca and ketchup mixed together- bland, lumpy, sour, and nowhere near the real thing. Only buy and read this book if you have no real interest in Wicca, and are just interested in getting Suzie or Pubert under you love-power. The title is misleading, since it does not describe or in any way teach/practice Wicca. As Jay Sherman says- ""It Stinks!"" -Julia"
2,Not a great book!!,"I would not recommend this book to anyone just beginning to follow the Wiccan path. The love spells are in violation of the Wiccan Rede and unfortunately, if this is one of your first books, you may not know or understand this (and could get yourself into some trouble!!). I would recommend reading many other books--such as ""Wicca"" and ""Living Wicca"" by Scott Cunningham and ""The Spiral Dance"" by Starhawk--before purchasing/using spells from this one. Some of the information is useful, such as the herbal and colour correlations, but overall, not a wise buy!"
3,"Not a good *Wicca* book, but a GREAT folk magic book","The major fault of this book is that it does not follow all of the Wiccan laws or beliefs. It gave some of my friends the wrong idea about Wicca (ie it's all about casting love spells to control others) I'd give this book 5 stars if it was ""The Folk Magic Spellbook"", then it would be a handy reference on the subject. If you are interested in that, buy it, you'll really love it :)"
3,This book is okay...,"When I got this book,it had very useful information on divination,amulets,dreams,potions,spellcraft,etc.This book is mainly about magickal practice,but it doesn't focus too much on the wiccan rede.Before anyone reads this book,I'd recommendreading books that give the reader a better idea of what wicca is,because this book is mostly about spells n' stuff.Here are a few:Teen Witch by Silver Ravenwolf(it's a little babyish,but it has useful info),Embracing the Moon by Yasmine Galenorn (exposes the reader to many types of wiccan practices).The Wicca Spellbook is a good book about magick,but it doesn't cover much of wicca."
4,The New Girl On the Block,"The book was enlightening for a beginning student of the craft such as myself. She included information that was pretty far fetched. It was a good read. I would definetly recommend her books. As a new student, I am in search for a collection or a very potent love and attraction spell that actually works has any advanced practitioner out there been able to find one of these. Please guide a new kid on the block.Cassandra"
3,Prettty much a good book.,"I use this every once in a while, and although at times some of the spells are somewhat ""out there"", it has helped me quite a bit. I found only a few problems, especially the blood rites. But all in all, this makes a fairly good reference book."
2,Disapointing,This book was disapointing and didn't have what I was looking for in it's content. It was very unresourceful and there were'nt enough rituals or spells and it didn't have detailed instructions.
1,Yet another one...,It seems that all of Gerina Dunwich's books contain the same regurgitated information just presented in a different context and subject form. This book is no exception. Dreadfully dull.
2,My first book on Wicca--and thankfully only the first,"This was the first book I ever read on Wicca and true Witchcraft. And thankfully it was only the first, because the book is terrible. A lot of the spells are in violation of the Rede, such as spells to gain power over another, and spells involving bird's blood and such. And some is just plain ridiculas, such as using jelly beans in an altar layout. I'm willling to bet the author picked up a lot of material through the classic brews of ""witches""--newt's ear, bat's blood, cow's foot, none of which actual ingreidients to anything but a very bad-smelling stew.In summary, a poorly written, badly researched book. If anyone wishes to read about real Wicca and learn something, I suggest one of Scott Cunningham's books."
1,PATHETIC,"Extremely stupid work by a very unenlightened individual trying to pass herself off as a witch. There were many so-called spells that were clearly culled from Judeo-Christian scources! (ie: Like reciting the ""Lord's Prayer"" backwads, burying a ""St. Joseph"" statue in your yard, etc...)! I wonder, does this person realize that the Christian Church murdered over 9 millon people during the past 300 years, and by including these types of spells in the book she actualy condones the Churches past violence. In a way she is saying she doesn't care about the sacrifice our ancestors made to bring us our faith and religion. Any REAL Wiccan would be highly angered at the fact Ms. Dunwich is ripping off our heritage, and making a good living doing so! Do yourself a favor and put this author on your black list and refrain from purchasing any more of her books."
1,NOT Wicca!,"This book is not a book of true Wicca spells; anything involving blood-rites is not Wicca. Wicca's rede is ""An harm thee none"". Be aware of this if you buy this book; the title is misleading!"
1,awful,"Just got this book. Not what I expected. Wow wicca spells using dove's blood and cat claws, itsn't this Voodoo or black magic. And the love spells violate the wicca rede. The christian cross as an amulet/talisman, never heard of that. How could a true wiccan wear a christian cross, is like a Jewish person wearing a Swaztika. The cross is the sign of the institutionalized, genoside church system. The real Jesus was a shaman. a healer with many powers, and someone who would not kill anything or anyone for the sake of a religion. He should not be the symbol for money making institutions. Well great cookie recipe on the back. You want good books, get Scott Cunningham's."
5,Very good with varied information,It is a fun book that gives great basics. It's one of the bests I've read so far as a beginner. A must!!!
2,It could be better,"It was a good group specially in late 60', when 'The Letter' was released, but the songs could be better selected cause when you don't find in the track list one of their best like 'Most of all', surely there's something wrong. It's was a sin to forget this song."
5,Great love story!,"Billy Dixon, aka Buster D, a great musician, was still able to make Lenore's heart sing after years of separation. But how could Lenore's heart forget Billy, when there would always be a reminder of him in their son, J.D. ""Rhapsody"" was about the love of two people that through earlier misunderstanding had tried to bury their true feelings for each other. However, Billy could never forget Lenore Foxwood. He had dreams about her. Lenore was his music. She was the reason for his music. He lived and breath Lenore in his music. ""Rhapsody"" was about their unsung and unfilled love. When Billy and Lenore finally reunite and let their emotions surface, the love that flows is like sweet music and eventually overshadows all obstacles that are still in their path and must be moved away. With Lenore's help, Billy's secret about his music is revealed, but does not ruin his career. Instead, because of Lenore, Billy's musical talents are heightened and indeed, there is a 'Rhapsody for Lenore'."
5,Felicia has outdone herself,"Rhapsody is wonderful. Felicia makes you ponder ""just where did she come up with this story""? They are too realistic. I am a loyal and faithful Felicia Mason fan for LIFE. She continues to EXCEED EXPECTATIONS. After reading Felicia, NO other writer makes the cut. Just read the book!!!!"
5,So powerful,"I have always admired Mr. Wiesel's work and this first book of his gives so much insight into his life's work. There is so much here that is just almost too frightening to imagine. I have toured the Holocaust Museum in Washington, D.C., and, with this books and others I have read, still find it so difficult to understand how people could commit such cruel acts against other people. It is a book that is sad and inspiring; frightening and hopeful. This should never, never, never, happen again in any form and it has happened again in many forms all over the world. We must continue to read, and study this and other tragedies so that we will make the inhumane activities of man will stop!"
5,Awesome!,"This is an absolutely awesome book! It is so compelling that I couldn't put it down!I truly think Night should be required reading for all high school students.Thanks to Oprah's National High School essay contest, I ordered the book for my son, but I believe that it was me, who learned the most!"
5,tragic diary,"Mr. Wiesel provides details written with such clarity that I was cringing as I read this book. The most poignant point is how could have this been allowed to continue then, and then we see Darfur today and its easy to realize that our leadership often takes a 'no see no do' outlook on world events."
5,Night by Elie Wiesel,This is a disturbingly honest portrayal of a Nazi concentration camp during World War II written in a young captive's own words.
4,Great literature!,"I recommend this book because of its powerful images of a young Jewish boy during the end of World War II. Ellie is faced with many questions of how the tragic events of the war could happen. The moving story of his struggles afterward, gave me a greater understanding of humanity."
3,Night,"Book was O.K. not earth shattering as some of Oprah's other booksuggestions. Liked ""A Million Little Pieces"" much better even though it has since proven a fake. Still would recommend that book before Night. So be it."
4,Slim volume,"This is a nice quick read for anyone under the mistaken impression that Oprah's journey to the top was an easy one. Some discussion has arisen as to the ratio of fiction to autobiography in the book, but if, like me, you've grown a bit complacent about Oprah's comfortable position in society, this slim volume will put things into perspective. I knew she had had some tough times early on, but this was really quite a shock..."
2,The story is darkest than its title (Night,The story is darkest than its title (Night). It is no use trying to describe it. I think everyone should read and discover it for him- or herself... I think it is only good that it is a rather short story. It is too heartbreaking to make it any longer. I respect Oprah to find the most meaningful stories for her Book Club.
1,A big waste of time,"This is the most depressing and boring book I have ever read. Just what the literary value is in this book, I will never know. I kept waiting for some sort of a plot to develop. It never did. What a fluke to have received the Nobel prize.I actually would rate this NO STARS."
1,boring book,this book is mad boring. its just another one of those holocaust books they force you to read in school
3,"So sad, so much pain","Some of the scenes went on and on and on, but overall it was very heart touching, eye opening look at the truth of the situation."
4,Riveting,"This should be a must read for all high school students. What happened with the Jewish people during the Second World War was horrific. Wiesel's ""diary"" was heart wrenching."
3,Dark and depressing,"It amazed me, while reading Night, at how complacent the Jews were while being placed into the ghettos. This is probably because I knew what was going to take place for them after the ghettos. As usual, this holocaust experience makes you wonder about the behavior of our society and human thought."
4,"No question, this is an important book","I recognize the power of this little book. The events narrated here are horrific and memorable. We all should read this and vow not to repeat this in our history. However, stylistically speaking, the writing is not super exceptional. It may just be the translation."
5,Night,"As Oprah had said, ""I believe all should read this book"". It was so unbelievable that all of this took place and someone actually lived through it to tell the story. Night was very heart wrenching and makes anyone happy that we can live the day to day lives that we do."
4,"Very moving, impactful, horrific......",Very well written. Gets to the point. This is the FIRST book I've read (other than Diary of Anne Frank) about the concentration camps & the horrific plight of those who endured them. I CAN say - Weisel does an excellent job of conveying what happened during the years being confined and moved among camps. And fortunately for us - he paints a good enough picture of the experience without having to go in to more details that he easily could have. It makes you want to go back in time & CHANGE what happened. It makes me NOT want to read anymore on this subject b/c of the unspeakable horrors that existed & no one did anything about.
4,Great- but something missing?,"I did enjoy this book. However it seemed to have missing parts or something of the like. I understand these events occurred quite some time ago, and that any recollection as time goes on is a wonderful work of art,but in the 'gaps' of recollection that seemed, I would have liked more of a description of the surroundings and people.I would highly recommend this book. Even those not terribly schooled on the Holocaust are able to follow quite well."
4,Night,It was a very moving story of torture to human beings. It was hard to read and take in. It was appalling to recall what was done during World War II.
5,Outstanding,I ordered the book and it arrived very quickly...in perfect condition. Impressive. Thank you...
5,quiet the thriller,the tension in this book is unrelentless. Like watching a Mission Impossible movie. I read this book in two hours. Horrifying that this had to happen to people.
4,A Fast Troubling Read,"I thought I had heard everything there was about the this troubling time in history but Elie Wiesel presents a new view and a different point of view from the trauma that a thirteen year old experienced. It is still so amazing to me how strong the hope is that everything will be okay when the world around is falling apart. This is a fast read that will cause to re-examine how something like this could happen and how so many could be involved in the torture. While I rarely read Intros and forwards, this is one not to miss."
4,Heart Touching,This is a story of a pre-teen and his family and their story of the Nazi war camps. Very moving story. Good for 8th grade through adulthood.
3,Something is missing......,"This book is well written. I understand that it is a true story and has been revised for a clearer interpretation. However, too much has been cut from the story. It's like an overview. Not much detail or substance."
2,Night,"This story has been told so many times and this did not add anything new that hasn't been told many times before. I know this was his life, but many people have had this life."
2,"2.5 stars, could have been better","I was expecting so much detail, but it lacked. The book felt rushed, so maybe the longer version held more in depth descriptions. There's so many questions while reading that should of been answered, but they never are, you can only assume. What gave this book 2.5 stars, was his determination and courage to share his experience and his actions in the book."
5,Night,This book is so exciting and keeps the reader on the edge of their chair which is the reason I completly read it it in one days time.
4,Night,"I found this to be a very emotional book. I cannot imagine going through what these people did, especially Elie Wiesel.I am thankful someone continues to write about this so it will not be forgotten."
4,"Elie Wiesel's ""Night""","Elie Wiesel's book ""Night"" highlights the horrors of the Holocaust as it chronicles the journey of a young Jewish boy (Wiesel) and his father through Nazi concentration camps.Using straightforward language and simple sentence structure, Weisel paints a picture of life in the death camps. He repeatedly uses the symbolism of fire and of nighttime, with excerpts that could move someone to tears. He says that he would never ""forget that night... which has turned my life into one long night."" He would ""never forget those flames which consumed my faith forever.""Most of the book however, simply tells a story. It relates terrors with no particularly pretty words or fancy writing. Usually it reflects limited anger or sadness, but simply says what must be said."
4,Heartbreaking story,"I have read many accounts of the Holocaust, but I think this one is the clearest. It is a short story (thank goodness!) and not cluttered with lots of dialogue. It gives a clear and very gruesome picture of what it was like to suffer through that horrific time. I was very moved by this story and will not soon forget it."
4,Night,This is my passion. I remember this time in history. I like to know more of the inside things that happened. I have visitedIsrael two times. It is sad what the world is still trying to do to such a small country.
5,Insightful and Moving,Dr. Wiesel's account of his experience of the inhumane extermination of the Jewish people is profoundly moving. There is an inclusiveness in his description of human suffering that reaches out to all people. He is not absorbed in self-pity but intensely drawn in to the people of Darfur and South Africa as in other parts of the world. His faith remains invincible as does his questions remain disquieting.
5,Let us never forget.,"I think this book should be mandetory reading for every High School student in this country. Mr Wiesel's writing of his life experience haunted me for weeks. Thank you for sharing. Please people, Let us never forget."
4,good,"Sometimes a hard read when he's telling about the the inhumanities. But very insightful. I'd recommend reading this book, especially for school age children where the holocast is being taken out of the history books."
3,True,"Toough read if you're squimish. Wiesel states facts, but does not paint a picture to let you feel that you are there."
5,A brief memoir of a terrifying ordeal,"This book is certainly not for the faint of heart.To this day The Holocaust is justifiably regarded as one of the most horrifying moments in the history of mankind--and for good reason as this novel clearly illustrates.Be it marching through the subzero terrain under the threat of certain death, or the deplorable conditions within the death camps, Weisel does what the history books cannot: he puts a human spin on what the Nazi regime did to families and countries as a whole, and how the scars are still healing to this day.A transcription of Weisel's speech is both poignant and timely, as the war between Israel & Palestine has no end in sight. I highly recommend this piece for all middle school and high school cirriculums, as well as those who wish to have a firt-hand account of what can happen when we do not speak up for our fellow citizens."
4,good. came as described,It came only 2 days after its first predicted date. It came the way it was described in its description. Overall good
5,Night,A vitally important chronicle to alert generations that people can indeed treat other people in inhuman ways. The author lived the treatment. No one now or in the future should forget that it is possible.
4,Noght Review,"Though the subject matter was very somber and terrifying at times, this was a great book made all the better because it was true."
5,Excellent,"Seems to ask the question, ""why didn't we act sooner"", yet then ""what would you do""? It was the unimaginable that was befalling them, they could not have imagined what they were about to encounter and thus how could they have believed things would ever be as bleak and horrid as they became? A gut wrenching book, hard to read of course but a must read, I'd say for every school child, lest anyone dare forget what evil man can inflict upon man."
3,I Want More Info!,"I recently finished reading Night for a school project. This was my second time reading it and I noticed so much more detail this time. While it was a good read, I was wanting more. I wish Elie would have included more about his life. Also, I would have loved to know more about his sisters and other family members. I did some research and found out that Elie was actually reunited with his sisters! You would have never known when reading Night, I thought they had perished in the Holocaust. I also would have liked to know about Elie's life after the Holocaust. What were the long term effects? What does he have to say to the world about his experience? What advice does he have to offer to the world?"
4,"Brief, but powerful","Of course, there are many accounts of Jewish suffering in the Nazi concentration camps, and some may be more bloody and gruesome than this one. However, you must take into account what Wiesel did afterward. Instead of become an embittered, reclusive vagabond, he took what he could learn from the experience and spent the rest of his life trying to help others and sharing lessons that could actually make the world a little better place. So, though the account is brief and rather matter of fact, it holds within it the heart of a champion for peace. In place of emoting self-pity and angst, Wiesel tells his story simply and deliberately, and we must be thankful that this was only the beginning."
3,Disappointed,"The Book Club that I lead opted to read this as soon as we learned of it being chosen by Oprah. The concensus of the group is that we were disappointed. One explanation is that NIGHT is lacking in passion. Admittedly, this was a quick read, and we wonder if the translation is more at fault than the author, who's original transcript exceeded 800 pages. This will probably prove to be an excellent introductory book, and may well find its place on school shelves. Those of us who are more mature, and familiar with books and films describing this horrible period in our civilization, will not find anything new or insightful in this edition of NIGHT."
2,Night,"I bought this book thinking I would learn more about the Holocaust,but that was not the case. I rate it fair and somewhat boring."
1,i hate it,it didnt came on time and i got an F on a report i had to do based on the book becuse i didnt have the book!
3,High School Students Must Read,This book is receiving 3 stars because the length makes it perfect for any high school student to read. The holocaust is something every child should study to prevent it from ever happeing again. But my personal preference in regards to the subject is The Diary of Anne Frank. Anne Frank makes you feel like you are enduring everything happening to her but Night was more like reading a documentary on the subject.
4,A Book That Must Be Read,"By its very subject matter, this is not a book to enjoy. It is, however, a story that needs to be read."
5,Oustanding book,I highly recommend this book to everyone who desires a glimpse into the events of the holocaust. Very well written and difficult to put down. An excellent choice for middle and high school students as well.
4,An unimaginable horror,"Having left Germany in 1933 to live in the Land of Israel I was spared the horrors that befell Elie Wiesel. Reading his book shows me how lucky I, and others like me, were and are.Even though I know that these horrors did take place, I cannot for the life of me understand or imagine that such cruelty can exist. Neither can I phantom how people who went through those camps survive. How do they reconcile and come to terms with what they experienced, and can still believe in God and goodness of men.RenateArtist poet & the author of the autobiographyFrom the Promised Land to the Lucky Country"
5,Excellent and sad,"I started reading this book one evening and didn't stop until I was finished. For me there can be no higher praise. Night is a well written (and depressing) pictures of the author's life as a Jew in WWII Germany. The books starts before his internment, ends with his liberation, and paints a vivid and horrifying picture of everything in between. I was so intensely frustrated reading about how the Jews refused to believe bad things were happening through the patches the ghetto's even right up until they were being marched into gas chambers single file. Whenever I watch/read something about the holocaust the most amazing thing for me is how so many people just marched trustingly along right to their deaths."
4,Night,This is a very moving account of a personal account. Reading this through the eyes of an adolescent is a different perspective and very eyeopening.Glad to hear this is being read by high school age children. History should be told this way.
3,Shortened,"I completed this story in three evenings. I am not really sure how to rate it. In reading the Preface, we learn from the author that the original book was longer and that the newest translation was preformed by his wife who shortened it considerably, perhaps because of limitations from the publisher? Throughout the book, the authors' descriptions and writing are very short and to the point, so much in fact that what would seem like important events are sometimes limited to one or two sentences and nothing further. No doubt that there were instances within the book which captured the horror and misery of the holocaust, but to me some portions seemed somewhat watered-down. Again, in the preface the author shares with us some of the writing which was left out of this version. I would love to read the original uncut book in its entirety."
4,"Powerful, eye opening",It's hard to believe such a short book (my copy only had 83 pages but contained pieces of other stories after that also relate to the holocaust) could be so powerful and eye opening. It's difficult to sit and read the details of what these people had to suffer through everyday just to try and stay alive. I completely understand why Wiesel started questioning his God that he was always so loyal to. Who wouldn't in his situation? It's really frightening to know that this actually happened and could happen again someday. I just hope it doesn't.
4,Not a Steven Spielberg Production...,"""Night"" is a rarity: an example of Holocaust art or literature that doesn't find melodrama or meaning in genocidal suffering.Here's the storyline: Jews are deported to camps, where the weak are murdered and the strong are enslaved. The slaves are quickly dehumanized by fear, hunger and exhaustion. They fight over crumbs of bread; they break faith with one another; they lose faith in God. As Germany collapses, they are marched to new camps in the dead of winter. They freeze to death in the snow; they are shot like dogs. Their torment only ends when the Germans are defeated by the Allies. Along the way, a pious teenage boy sees the truth about the world and becomes an atheist.The writing is spare and economical. The victims come across as victims, not as heroes. They don't emerge from black and white into a world of technocolor. It all happened. ""Night"" should be read by every educated person."
5,excellent,"This book was an excellent book, easy to read and really touches your heart. I will definitely be reading Mr. Wiesel's other works."
5,Shocking!,"Very sad, very shocking and extremely good reading. I didn't want the story to end; I wanted to find out more details. Right up there with The Diary of Anne Frank! Worth reading over and over again."
4,Night,"This book is about faith & empathy. Empathy is sorely missing in the lives of especially our children in todays society. This should be a MUST read in schools just as the ""The Diary of Anne Frank"" was when I was a child. Very thought provoking."
5,"Powerful, Powerful firsthand account of the Holocaust","Powerful, Powerful firsthand account of the Holocaust. Sad, poignant, bitter are words that come to my mind. And yet in reality my feeling after reading this is undefinable. It's incomprehensible that human beings would treat others so inhumanely. This period in our history is deeply troubling but even more heartbreaking (can it be more?) given the personal face of the author. A lot of books are given the title 'must-read'. But every person on the planet must read this book so we do not forget, so we do not think it is over exaggerated, so we do not let history repeat itself. My fear is we will forget and present events show us we are still capble of these unspeakable acts."
1,Night CD,"This CD is clear and well spoken, but it is based on a French translation of Night that does not match the paperbacks that our school has for use. It is fairly close but the sentences are reworded in most areas, and synonyms are used for quite a few ofthe words. Maybe 10-15% of the book is the same. I did not see anywhere when buying it that it is based on a foreign translation. The students found it interesting, but my lower readers were totally lost and confused as they tried to follow along in the book. Fortunately a colleague loaned me her CD that follows word for word."
1,"Sorry, this one was a snoozer for me","I'm afraid this may have been recommended by Oprah, but I found it terribly slow and boring. Some may get upset because in this politically correct age, we're supposed to have to like a book like this. But, frankly I'm sorry I wasted my money on this one :("
1,Night,This was a true story of the holocaust told by a survivor. It was very believable and it explained the horrible imprisonment of Jews during WWII and their extermination. It told of their starvation and forced labor and ended with the forced march at the end of the war to evade the Allied forces. It is heart rending in its devastation to families and entire neighborhoods.
1,kodyb24,"I recently ordered the book Night from kodyb24 on Amazon. I am new to this site but had heard great things about it. apparently they do not screen the people who sell their stuff on here. I received a large micosoft manuel stuffed in a box full of paper instead of the book I ordered. WOW! Does this normally happen alot on Amazon? I would love some feed back. Thank you, Brandy"
3,Intense,"An intense portrayl of the horrors Elie experienced during the Holocaust and the beautiful will to survive. I was expecting to read about Elie's view of God at the end of the book, but was disappointed that it was never brought up again."
3,A Great Work of History - A Nightmare Recounted,"One can not critique a Nobel Prize Winner, even if the Pirze was for peace and not Literature. This is not a book for children, nor for the innocent. It is a real-life tragedy.Not a big difference from earlier versions of Night, it is a horrible, real picture of Life as it was, as it still is, and as it will always be. When we ask how can such atrocities happen, we need only look at today's news and read about accidental bombings in Iraq which kill hundreds off innocents. There is no question man learns little from his mistakes. And the similarities between persecution of the Jews, Gypsies, homosexuals during WWII is being repeated daily with the Islamic war against the West. (or is the West's war against Islam?)Night is so real, it is hard to draw the parallel with today. What have we learned from such a scholar as Elie Wiesel?"
4,A must read.,"I'm not sure I enjoyed this book, it was very troubling to read. You hate to think anybody ever had to go through what these people did. But it is important for everyone to know and I recomend this book."
2,"Seriously, this book isn't that good","I read it the 11th or 12th grade and all I could think about throughout the whole thing was how badly written it was. I just didn't see what was so special about it. If anything it's probably the worst Holocaust book I've read. It's so short too but when you read it, it feels like a long time cause that's how boring it is. Okay, so he was a victim of the Holocaust. So that doesn't mean people have to pretend to like a book he wrote about it because it's really tragical."
2,boring story not satisfied,i personally did not like this book. i was made to read this book for school. it felt very bland. i wouldnt recommend it to a friend. if you want to read a great holocaust book i recommend the book theif.
3,A Sad Journey,"Very sad, and I am surprised more parents haven't freaked out about this being in the required reading in a lot of school, maybe complaining it causes depression. I like this book when I read it years ago, but I don't know if I would pick it up again."
5,Such Tremendous Force,"What can I possibly say that hasn't already been said? This account of Eli Wiesel's experience in the concentration and death camps of Nazi Germany is horrifying and tears at the heart. The reader easily understands his questions of guilt and anger, and yet, it is also a story of triumph, ultimately. Others have expressed their thoughts better than I, but I feel this work should be required reading in every school. It is that important. And excellent work that is read within a few hours. Though it will change you."
5,UNBELIEVEABLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This is a rare book.......what a gripping story. Unbeleiveable what the author went thru and amazingly survived it!! This is by far the GREATEST book that I have read!!! I'd give it a strong 5 stars. I am stationed in Germany and because of this book there is no way I'm leaving Europe without going to Auschwitz myself!!!!!!!!!! What a extraordinary read!!!
5,What an amazing man,"This book has stayed with me for years, and there's nothing but admiration I have for Mr Wiesel.However, it diminishes the power, message, and strength of the man by smearing it with Oprah's name."
5,Great Book,"Night is an excellent book that I would recommend to anybody that is looking for a nonfiction book. I read this book my sophomore year in high school and really do not think I got the full picture of it until I just read it recently for a writing class. This book really opens the reader's eye and shows how horrific these events actually were. I believe it is a very good thing that Ellie wrote this book so that everyone can see what happened in the past in order to try to prevent something like this happening ever again. The only thing that I wish he would have added to the end of the book was how it affected his life after he was out, but otherwise it was a fantastic book that I would recommend everyone to read."
4,poignant holocaust survival story,This book gave me the chills and brought me to tears with its very personal and terrifying account of the unthinkable horrors of the Holocaust. Not since The Pianist have I read such a detailed factual memoir. Read it with a box of kleenex.
4,Boil the frog.,"Elie Wiesel's first-hand account of living through the hellishness of a work camp gave me insight into how this happened. Just as (I hear) a frog placed in a beaker of water doesn't realize until too late that the temperature of the water it sits in is slowly rising to the boiling point, the Jews were slowly drawn more and more deeply into their situation. At each level, these civilized human beings could not fathom that life would get worse, and chose not to believe human beings could treat other human beings in ways it seemed they were about to be treated. They forgave their torturers even as the torture continued, and they assumed it was a mistake that would quickly be exposed and reversed. We all know now, sickeningly, they were much too kind in their opinion of their captors, until it was much too late. We realize, sometimes too slowly, that there is pure evil in this world."
2,Amateurish Robotic and Lacking,"The book is simply amateurish and I cannot fathom the merit of its rave reviews - certainly not as a noteworthy BOOK and I wonder how much the vote has to do with sentimental PC endorsement of the story VS the value of it as a book. It has very little going for itself, except the unemotional list of events presented in a rushed and sloppy book. Perhaps it was all lost in translation? I have read incredible survivor accounts here [...] and recommend you rather spend an hour or two reading this link, than buying and reading this detached and robotic account. Once again, confirmation that if a book has an Oprah book club sticker, its well worth avoiding..."
3,Not what I thought,"I purchased this book on my Kindle for my daughter to read for class. She has left her book at school and was supposed to read to page 43 that night. None of the pages made sense and she did not know where to stop or start. She went to school the next day and other kids were talking about some crazy things that happened that she hadn't read and they didn't read what she had read. I don't know what happened but on the kindle, it can't match to the book. She did say the story was interesting but with the pages messed up it does not help with her assignment."
3,It was not what they say...,"It was good, but the reviews acted like it was the best book ever, and I have read better on this subject, such as Leon Uris' QB 13."
3,good one,"We must remember what was done to millions of people as Hitler tried to achieve a superior race. This book caused me to go back and reread Corrie Ten Boom's book, -The Hiding Place-. Both are unbelievable stries of survival."
2,Not worth it...,"What can I say, I heard a lot of hype over this book and was anxious to read it. But, I was very disappointed. The author, in my opinion, seems to blame God throughout the entire book for what happened to him and his family. He has an incredibly selfish and generally uncaring attitude. Sorry but, of all the books about the holocaust that I have read this was by far the worst."
3,The reviewer R Schreiber is clearly an antisemite,"Saying ""the ubiquitous influence wielded by his co-tribalists in all facets of western society"" reminds me of 'The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion'. I too did not enjoy the book as I felt it was overly superficial. But the generalizations made by this German antisemite are outrageous and come to show that no matter how much evidence is put forward regarding the holocaust there are still those that will try to make us forget.Never forget and never forgive."
4,Night by Elie Weisel,"This book is a page turner in that this mans journey through hell and back is just unfathomable. God bless him! This gentle soul, is just an amazing writer in which he can take his readers along a virtual life path in order to relive his life from when he was a young boy until the end of World War II. The deception that hid in plain sight was what really took me back. Who could ever have even imagined that mankind be so evil. Hell on earth doesn't come close to describing what this yound boy went through. It makes one think. Mr. Elie Weisel has that special gift and quality as a writer in describing his inner most thoughts and feelings as he somehow some way survives it all. What an amazing book. Thank you."
3,Night,Wonderful. I recommend this to anyone who wants to read about the holocaust and what the Jewish endured. One of the best I have read on the subject.
5,Amazing,"This book is full of heart break and sadness. Perhaps it's more saddening because these are real accounts of the holocaust. However, though this book is at some points very saddening, it's at tremendous read. And I recommend this book to anyone especially if they are seeking to read a holocaust book."
5,Excellent and honest,The book was all I expected. Couldnt put it down. More people need to read it. My son is also reading this in high school.
2,Just Okay,This story just failed to really make me want to read until I was done with the story I would not suggest this to any of my friends it just failed on every level.It is not a great approach to the whole story line and I did not care for the book at all.
2,Night,"I purchased this book so I could follow along with the class that I work in, but the book was not exactly the same. It was a dumbed down version of the one the class was reading. I was a little disappointed but I should have realized it was a slightly different version before I purchased it. The book itself is wonderful and I believe everyone should read it at some point in their lives! It truly amazes me what the Jews, and others went through during this time!"
5,Night - a tough read...,"This is a real life book of someone's life at the time. The life of the writer was horrible . How does anyone write about the past that was so horrific? The message I get is..."" We should not forget the horrible things that humans do to one another."" It's tough to read what humans do....but it is also refreshing to see the strength that some people have in order to survive. The writer's aim is to involve the reader in the brutality of some, mingled with the kindness and love from people who risk their lives to help others.I cannot read more than a few pages at a time because of the sadness and pain that overcomes me. But, I will read and finish it.I owe it to the writer who wrote it, with so much pain, so that man can examine what he has, and pass on to his children what horrors life can bring. People ought to know there is much pain in the world and perhaps learn."
4,Night,"I was very moved by this book, I can't say I enjoyed it, due to the subject matter. Once I picked it up, I had to read it straight thru in one sitting. Book was short but really held your interest."
4,Night,"This book was both wonderful and disturbing. The translation was smooth and easy to read. The body of the book gives a further glimpse into the terrors of that war, and the suffering people had to endure; especially children. I finished this book in less than a day, and when I was done, I was able to appreciate my life even more, and be grateful for everthing I have."
4,"Dark, Depressing and Essential","This is a disturbingly dark and draining novel. There are no lights at the end of the tunnel, no rays of sunshine, no hint of humanity in the oppressors or sliver of hope for the suffering. It does all this with a purpose, to document the stories and the state of mind, and accomplishes its very ambitious goals.This is fiction, by definition. This bothered me at first, even if it was 'based on facts', since the events described are so disturbing. Allowing an author creative freedom in describing such atrocities just doesn't seem right. This prompted me to research the background and find that, with some relatively minor discrepancies, that can be expected with multiple witnesses, the events described have all been corroborated by other people who were in the same camps.This is a short read. This is a draining read. This is not a fun read. It comes recommended."
4,Night (College Writing Review),"Night, an excellent tale of love and determination, carries us through a story of a boy and his father as they travel through different death camps. The two fight through times of separation and pain, constantly showing their love for one another and fight to survive. Through the ups and downs the book keeps you guessing as to what will happen next throughout the entire novel. I would recomment this book for any history buff, or anyone who loves a good read!"
5,Powerful,"This is a very moving book. It brought me to tears several times. However, I felt that it was important to know and never forget what this individual and thousands went through. Elie Wiesel is a strong writer and deeply gets his point across!"
5,Night,I was absolutely touched by this account. I cried after I read it and think that it should be required reading.
5,Interesting...,"Interesting how all of Jeff Madisons reviews, including the one for this book, have been taken from other reviews from other sites, like Sparkle. Jeff has 75 reviews and so far it looks like over 14 that I've found so far as not his but other peoples. I dont think we should listen to what he says or vote on his reviews. I have reported his activity.Thank you. Dina Reynolds"
2,Took me ages to write this brief review,I feel a little bad giving this book a poor rating because of its subject matter. I just felt it didn't go into the characters and experiences enough. I felt it ended too quickly and didn't stand out.
4,Charming light reading for bibliophiles.,"A friend purchased an older edition of this book for me. He pulled it out of the fifty-cent rack outside a local bookshop. He was attracted to the title.I knew nothing of Morley at the time, but I read the first sentence and wanted to keep going. I read it all the way through. Light reading for people who don't necessarily like bestsellers, it's all charm and comfort and Brooklyn brownstones. Just delightful. How lovely to see it go through yet another edition (it has gone through many, now through almost a century)."
4,The world of the bookseller,"Good story about the world of the bookseller, though I did like Parnassus on Wheels better because of the narrator, who is just a side character in this book. This book is also a very interesting look into the American mind immediately after World War I. The bookseller has many underlinable speeches about the importance of books in a world of peace. For the modern reader, it's depressing, knowing that the utter non-peace of World War II -- and indeed most of the rest of the 20th century and all of the 21st-- hangs over this optimist's head."
3,"A bit dated, but a must read for any booklover","Interesting for any book (or bookshop) lover. A fun read, but a mediocre mystery. Loaded with stereotypes, but forgivable for the time period.The story of a used bookshop in Brooklyn at the very end of WWI, and strange incidents that befall a young ad salesman who befriends the shop owners."
5,My dog loves this food!,"I bought this as a supplement in between dry food - so she could have a mixture. But now, Chloe is refusing any food but this. It is much more expensive than the dry food that I was feeding her - but it is definitely worth it. It is made with real meat - and no byproducts, which is important to me!This is a great food for the money."
4,Great,Most all of the Merrick dog food is very well made. Some of it looks like human food. Highly recommended.
3,Not my dogs favorite flavor,The 3 stars is not for the quality but from my dogs enthusiasm compared to the other Merrick dog foods. She just prefers the other flavors more. The packaging could be better to keep the cans from getting dented and crushed.
2,Turns off every 4-5 mins.,"The price for the product was good and what I received worked as expected as far as sound quality goes. My biggest gripe with the product is that it turns off about 4-5 mins into a song on its own. I understand a feature like that being implemented into another similar product that might require batteries to work as an energy saver when the product is in idle mode, but this one is hooked up to the car, no batteries needed. Look elsewhere unless you're ok with having to manually turn on the thing every 4-5 minutes."
2,mediocre but cheap,"this item was cheap. that's why i bought it. it does what it needs to do - play music from my mp3 player on my car stereo. the major drawback is that it just shuts off periodically in the middle of a song, so i have to unplug it and plug it in again. i have a cheap mp3 player too, which makes the music a little distorted in conjuction with adaptor. it's acceptable. if i wanted a better product i would have shelled out more money."
5,MP3 auto transmitter/player,"I bought this for my wife, who uses it almost every day. I received the fm transmitter in a timely manner. It fit into the car with no problems, and so far, it seems to work as intended. The price was right, so am satisfied with the shopping experience."
2,Okay at best,"The sound quality okay, not nearly as good as other FM transmitters I've used, even on clear channels. Does not seem to have the power as other transmitters either.The most annoying this is that it will turn off if it thinks you are no longer playing music. This typically happens to me when a quite song comes on. Because the radio is turned way up to hear the music (my ipod's volume is almost maxed out and this still happens) when this happens you get an earfull of deafening static."
3,Gets the job done,"This modulator works as well as can be expected. I bought this to use with my iPod while driving a rental car. It did what it was supposed to do, but not much more. The sound quality was tolerable. The music was a bit tinny and there was some static in the larger cities, but overall it worked as advertised. A solid buy and will do what you need it to do."
3,Decent.,"Not amazing. got what I paid for. does not have any amplification of the signal, which better quality transmitters have, which results in quieter signal."
2,"obsolete, not easy to use, avoid!","this itrip FM transmitter is not the cutting edge one, therefore, we cant expect too much. But the sound quality is not good enough after you connect it to your ipod or other mp3. Also, it doesn't power up automatically when you start your car. You have to pull it off then back in to start it. It's ""convenient"" only when you always left it hooked up to your car and don't want it to power-on simutaneously. But the most important is, it doesn't have a ""smart scan"" function like its new surpasser ""itrip auto"" or ""itrip auto (2008)"". If your travel covers a long distance, like interstate, your radio band that suits best for the transmitter may change too. and once that, you have to adjust it with many clicks on button up or down while you're driving. That's insanely dangeous and complex! So, i would not suggest this one, instead, get a newer model though some bucks more would be added to your budget.Griffin iTrip Auto FM Transmitter and Auto Charger for iPod (Black)"
3,Beware if you have a Droid!,"I'm telling you, I've been using these iTrips for years (i've bought 3). I had one for my ipod but needed one that would plug through a headphone jack so I could listen to Pandora on my phone (LG Ally). It sounded great, no static, perfectly fine. I bought one for my girlfriend and plugged her phone in and wow, the static was so bad you could barely hear the thing. I tried switching radio stations and to no avail. Occasionally, when she's driving it will work, but lesson learned: if you are buying this for your phone, you might want to look into compatibility because something about the Droid caused interference."

3,"Interesting...Nearly Fell Asleep Viewing It. However, Great Acting By Ms. Harding.","Note: I saw this movie with XFinity On Demand.I admit that I nearly fell asleep while viewing this film; maybe I was really tired for some reason. Either way, it's an interesting film because of the plot (of which I admit, I thought there'd be more of the kid and the governess). Great acting by Ms. Harding, though. and Mr. Howard (soon to excel in The Scarlet Pimpernel and Gone With The Wind) is good here too.Maybe I'll view the film again."
4,Morrissey singles joy !,"Hello ! Before i start this text, i must excuse me for my bad english ! I'm from Quebec so i speak french... Do you accept me ?This second issue of box-set collection is a pleasure for all the fans of Moz. This cigarette case is enjoyable and the pleasure to have a complete singles collection is also ""plastic""- the pleasure to have the covers arts. But in fact, if you have all the albums of Moz and you like all of his songs, you dont have arguments to unlike this second box-set ! Enjoy it !"
5,great movies,i am very pleased with this movie. i only wanted 1 movie but got 2 for the price of 1. and i didnt have to wait long to receive them either. thnnk you
2,Dead Boring.,"There was nothing wrong with the CD.It was the fella singing, was like a one note one key dirge.If I had heard a sampler of the thing I would not have bought it.These things happen.David Fleming."
5,An oldie but a goodie,"I first received this book back around 1968 or 1969, when a boyfriend gave it to me as a birthday present. Over the years, I read and re-read it and enjoyed it just as much as always. And then I lost it about 20 years ago and assumed it was out of print. Now, with sellers online, I found it again and am very happy I did.My original version of the book was quite large, like a child's picture book. This one is small, about the size of a Kindle, but it makes no difference. It has the same wonderful, inspiring, often funny verse that I remembered from my teen years. Poems by William Carlos Williams, Ezra Pound, Dorothy Parker (Resume is a favorite), Langston Hughes, John Updike, and many others are still great reading --- and still feel current.Even if you're not a big poetry fan, you might find this little volume to your liking. Give it a try."
4,First Read It In 1973,I first met this book in 7th grade English class in 1973. It really got me excited about reading poetry. Now I'm teaching English and I wonder are there any books as good as that now for getting kids connected with poetry? I would like to know.
1,Blow(s) Things,"This group is not very good. Derivative Dylan meets Beatles, poorly executed. Sounds like Beau Brummels outtakes at best. Whenever they do have a good song they find a way to ruin it (like some of the Nashville recordings with poorly placed harmonies). If this stuff had been recorded in the early 60's it might be worth mentioning but the fact is a long line of better groups (Dylan, Beatles, Byrds, Beau Brummels) were already on the market. The only thing I liked was the avant-garde Twist and Shout cover. Beware of books that recommend this group, they are simply wrong. [...]."
3,eccellent!,"I loved this book! I read it and follwed the advise given. After reading it, I deciced although I have cp I can have a child. It was the enlightenment I needed! (my daughter is 9yrs. old now) Thank You!"
2,"Outdated, outdated, outdated!",This book is old and not full of much useful information for modern day women. It list specific conditions - mostly rare conditions - and fails to discuss the broader issues for mother with disabilities.
5,Sentimental,"This album makes me feel very much in touch with my emotions. It can mellow me out as much as it can make my eyes well. To me, the music on it is nothing short of suave, smart and heartfelt."
3,In Search of Infinity,"Roddy Hart is a singer/songwriter from Scotland. His music is melodic and acoustic-based. ""Bookmarks"" is a nice disc with dreamy midtempo tracks laced with piano ballads. The opener ""The Life & Times of Joseph Rowe"" is a wistful reflective song that harks back to Jackson Browne's era, ""In the sky a cool wind blows, to the sea a river flows, Where I'm headed no one knows, Oh let my spirit go."" Put a harmonica in a song and everyone says Dylan. ""She Is All I Need"" has a harmonica, but Hart's vocals are expressive with a wistful quality. ""Flames"" is peppy shuffle that brings to mind early Van Morrison with its full band arrangement, ""Chasing cars like shooting stars in search of some infinity, Turn on your love."" I've had this disc on five times now. Many of the tracks sound good like ""Suffocate"" & ""Time Is A Thief."" However, none of the songs absolutely grab me, making me want to listen over & over. This impressive disc offers much promise. Enjoy!"
4,An Enjoyable Listen,"I checked this out from the library, and enjoyed listening to it. The narrator is very good at creating distinguishable voices, and it was interesting to listen to. Tho I could tell how it would end, the journey there was an enjoyable one."
3,"Great game, but avoid the PSP version","Puzzle Quest is a wonderful concept, setting match-3 casual gameplay in a basic Roleplaying Game framework to create a fresh new approach. But the PSP version is bug ridden, and has crashed on me many times. I had read online about the bug that the companions you find in the game don't actually help at all - that's something I could live with. But I had to give up playing one character because every time I tried to scroll through his spells the game crashed and the PSP shut down. I'm most of the way through with a second character and have only experienced two intermittent crashes, but that's inexcusable in a released title like this. I'm a professional game developer and would never release one of my own games with this many serious bugs."
5,fun puzzle quest,i've only been playing this game a few minutes and i really love it. althoughit's super collapse like style it doesn't get old or monotinous.
1,puzzle quest not as good as it sounds,"I wanted to surprise my son (15) for Easter so I didn't ask him for the name of a new game. This was in the 2007 list of best games and sounded good. However, upon loading it, the writing is very tiny, even for his eyes, and the game not very challenging. He played it about four times and now is back using old games he had."
4,Puzzle Quest: Challenge of the Warlords,"This game is a great way to pass the time on trips. It's a more in-depth Bejeweled type game where you have a hero you level up while playing. If you enjoy games like Lumines or puzzle games in general you may like this game.The only thing I don't like about this game are a few bugs I have run into. They are minor performance problems were the game may slow down after defeating an opponent, but these can be overlooked and are nothing major."
5,Actions speak louder than words,"Everything people said highly touting this game is true. Deep fun puzzle game that appeals to people who love Bejeweled and even Magic: the gathering. I bought one, and days later am back to buy 2 more for my friends."
4,Puzzle Quest : PSP,"The game itself is fantastic. I now own a copy for both the PSP and DS. The PSP version's only flaw lies in the fact that your companions do not activate their abilities before appropriate battles. Other than that, the game is phenomenal"
2,The book was a bit outdated.,"I'm a recent college graduate and a former sorority woman. Sorority rush has changed tremendously in the past few years. While this book gives some good advice to future rushees and is able to familiarize young women with the rush process, the authors get away from the whole point of sororities. A sorority is a place where women can be themselves; young women should not feel as if they need to go out and get a manicure or buy a new wardrobe in order to receive a bid from a sorority. This is not the type of message the Panhellenic Council wants to portray. However, unlike most publicity these days, this book does promote many positive sides of Greek life and that is definitely something that deserves merit."
3,Misleading -- don't think you'll be ready after this,"This book does highlight a number of the reasons why I joined a sorority and why I love the Greek system. However, preparing yourself like this book recommends will only create more problems. If you aren't yourself you can easily end up in the ""wrong"" house."
1,AN EMPTY BOX,"James Russo, a competent actor, is the writer/producer/star of this tedious and overblown noir drama. He plays an ex-con who is trying to make a new start. He gets a job as a mechanic, meets a sexy waitress, falls for her and gets involved with shady characters and murders a few people along the way. Russo plays his role ala Prozac; Theresa Russell tries to maintain the sexy kittenish style she used 20 years ago and comes across pretty wimpy; Steve Railsback looks older than he is, and acts awfully and Michael Rooker hams it up as the bad guy. And oh yes, Chucky Brad Dourif is around as Russo's old friend. It's all been done before and better. And ultimately it's just a bore."
3,The wheel of fatality!,"An ex-con hasn't forgot his past. His criminal partner has been untouched and so he returns for his money that well deserved these missing years in prison.He decides to reinstall himself into the world, getting a job. But soon he will be trapped by the invisible hands of destiny, when he gets involved with a woman with a dark past.Here you have the basic premises that will lead us to a brilliant and suspenseful drama where once more, no one will be able to trespass the tragic limits behind the existential fence of the impeding reality."
4,A good read.,"I enjoyed this book, I just hated the daughter in this book because she was too much into her mothers business. I can't give this a 5, but a 4 is what I think it is. Good book if you have nothing to do. I recommend it."
2,What a shame,This recording shows its age and the tone is faint and not clear. It's hard to find Perlman in it.
4,Perhaps the second best recordings of these works,"I enjoy these versions of the Brahms violin sonatas. They are played passionately, even with a touch of sentiment on Perlman's part, but always tasteful and musical. However, to my taste, the Suk-Katchen, which is still in print, provides us a more Brahmsian reading with more introspection and delicacy. The sound on both recordings is excellent. Since the musical effect of the two recordings is sufficiently distinct, perhaps get both?"
2,Not the best read...,"I have read many different accounts of the relationships between Ted Hughes and Sylvia Plath, so I was intrigued as to the content of this fictionalized account. I confess that it was a struggle to make it to the end. The author did a good job of portraying the characters and making them real, but it was difficult to sort through all of the other mumbo-jumbo and get to the crux of the story."
2,Plathitudinous,"Unconvincing novel about Sylvia and Ted.She was a suicidal neurotic,he was a male chauvinist.End of story. To re-phrase Oscar Wilde,'To lose one wife by suicide may be regarded as a misfortune; to lose two looks like carelessness.'"
1,All these single stars equal less than one!,"All these one-star reviews are dead on. Oddly, though, from a mathematical perspective, if you add them all up, they only amount to about a half a star. That's how awful even the mere conception of this book is. If you have any doubts, let me offer one thought that I don't see presented so far: Do you really think it's just happenstance that this book only exists now that the three principals are dead? Tennant would have had her tail sued off had she tried something like this in Hughes' lifetime."
1,Couldn't toss it in the bin fast enough,"This book is in spectacularly bad taste. The ""fictionalizations"" is spiteful, jealous, transparently vindictive, and very badly written. So much so it is almost laughable in places.The author does not appear to understand that slandering someone is rhetorically very difficult-- usually the reader will see through the attempt, and end up sympathizing with the one being slandered.She particularly loses credibility in her portrayal of Clarissa Roche-- presented in this book as an almost angelic presence in Plath's life, with no gray areas. By golly, look at that! The book is dedicated to Roche! Uhmmm.. just how stupid does she think her readers are?My benefit of the doubt points for both Plath and Hughes have skyrocketted."
3,"Poetic, overheated character study","Since only real names are used and some chapters seem to follow Guardian articles beat for beat this novel really blurs fiction and non-fiction.Tennant writes beautifully, and it's best to think of this as rather heated, dreamy character studies since the plot is often difficult to track. You won't learn much here if you've seen the movie ""Sylvia."" But still, some of the imagined childhood of Assia, and certainly the dinner with her sad child, were effective. Ted largely remains a cipher, but perhaps he was; images of him as a killer are haunting.Not a lot of suspense and forward-motion, but lovely writing."
3,Distortion during the loud passages.........,Five stars for Jacqueline Du Pre and one star for the recording engineers. The performance by Du Pre is nothing short of beautiful but the recording (and or remastering) from the engineers is pathetic.I am an audiophile and own only high-quality audio components so I am able to hear every bit of detail and nuisance in a recording. During the loud passages of this recording one can hear quite a bit of distortion coming from the left channel. The distortion is so annoying that I will be searching for a different recording of the Dvorak Cello Concerto. Suggestions anyone ?????
4,good price !,installed and works great. never any problems after using it for months. may order more just to keep in stock
2,Not the best of lesbian erotica,"I was looking forward to reading this book from cover to cover in one sitting but it was impossible to do. This book is certainly not the ""best"" of lesbian erotica. I would suggest that the editors cast a wider net than they have done to see what they catch. The experience and focus were too narrow, story structures too hackneyed, definitely not new. There were two stories that were exceptions that saves my rating from dropping to zero. It was a disappointing collection. The editors must try to step out more often into the world to see what and where truly innovative writing is happening and bring it to us."
4,Another Smashing Hit for BLE,"Tristan Taormino has done it again. She and Amber Hollibaugh have picked 23 gems. They are hot, hot to the touch and the thought. There are several returning authors whose work continues to press boundaries and push buttons. They've added an international flavor this time with ""Farang Traveler or, A Girl's Guide to Patpong"" by Chris Lombardi and ""Redemption"" by Michael M. Hernandez, heartfelt, sly and wicked by turns. But Toni Amato humbles me. His clarity translates into painfully, joyfully brilliant prose and I am awed at the way that boi captures completely what I tremble to touch. This is an awesome collection, worthy of any erotica shelf."
1,Horribly Incomplete Wooden Prince,This is a shortened arrangement of The Wooden Prince.It does not contain a very significant section which is the most beautiful part of the finale.I cannot understand why the previous reviewer neglected to mention this fact.I would have appreciated the warning and I would not have purchased this CD.
3,shiloh,"I read the book Shiloh and I fell in love with it.Now I am alwaysreading it.I encourage you to go check this book out in yourlibrary and I promise you will love it.n"""
4,A good book to read if you like dogs,I gave this book 4 stars because I really don't like books that much but if I did then I would give it all five stars. The book is about a boy named Marty who finds a dog and names him Shiloh. He wants to keep the dog but he can't because he is Judd's dog. I chose this book because I saw the movie and I like dogs.
4,MICHAEL DELK'S BOOK OF SHOLIH,"It is about A boy who is walking down A street.While he was walking he haerd a dog. when he found the dog;it would not quit following him.Then when he got home;he found out it was Jude Travis's dog.then a fight for the dog started,and the boy won."
4,Shiloh,I thought Shiloh was a good book. If you like dogs and rescue stories you'll like this book. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes to read.
4,"Awesome, but Difficult","This was an awesome book but the script was at times hard to read. If the script was better written, I think it would've gotten a 5 star to me! Excellent book, I recommend this to whoever."
4,Stick your head in a book,"Shiloh, By Pyllis Reynolds Nayler.Theres a boy that finds a beagle that belonged to somebody realy mean. That somebody was Judd Travers. Judd said the boy could keep the dog if he worked for him for 20 hours.I think it's a good book but not the best so I gave it 4 stars."
5,A Book You'll Be Addicted To,"Shiloh by Phyllis Reynolds NaylorThis book is about a boy named Marty Preston and a abused dog who Marty later names Shiloh. Then Marty finds out that Shiloh belongs to Judd Travers a drunk man who mistreats his dogs. Marty has to hide Shiloh from his parents.When a German Sheperdattacks Shiloh his parents find out,and he has to give Shiloh back to Judd.Then when Judd shoots a doe out of season Marty has to blackmail Judd. So Marty has to work for Judd to buy ShilohI gave this book five stars because it is a heartwarming story that will keep you laughing and crying!"
3,I bet you've read this book already,"Ahhhhhhhh Shiloh... everybody knows what you're talking about when you say Shiloh. That story with the boy and the abused dog you know. I can guarantee you that at least 90% of Americans have read this book at one point in their lives.There's not much I can say about this book that hasn't already been said. It's a good book with a nice easy flowing story line. It also has colorful characters, and environment relative to the plot, which in my opinion give the book a feel of desperation which helps advance the plot. The book has a sense of realism to it. You feel like this could happen to anyone, any where, any time This realism helps some of the drama to create more moody situations.If this book weren't so popular and less successful I might have more to say, but that raps it up for me"
4,Shiloh,"""Shiloh"" is a perfect book for a dog lover. That is why I like it. I also like the author who is Phyllis Reynolds Naylor. She has also written ""Maniac Magee"". ""Shiloh"" is about a kid named Marty and his family. Marty was hunting one day and he found an adorable little beagle. He found the dog by the old Shiloh school that is why he named the dog ""Shiloh"". The family finds out the dog belongs to Judd Travis. He is not a very nice guy and he abuses his dogs. He took Shiloh away from Marty. I wont give away the ending, but it is a happy one. I will say that if you like heartwarming books about dogs then Shiloh is definitely a book worth reading."
5,My grandson loved the Book,This book throughout many of the school district Middle School and Junior Highs. The book is well written and grabs the attention of its young readers. I have used this book when Substitute Teaching Middle School Reading Classes for several years.
5,great middle school book for boy or girl,"highly recommend this book. My 11 year old loves it, and she is not an avid reader. I am reading it too and opens up great discussions."
4,Shiloh - Great Book,This was a good and very enjoyable read. I like the way it jumped between sides of the conflict and even characters on each side. It read very fast and easy.
5,Great kids book!,"I bought this book for my granddaughter, visiting from North Carolina. She needed it for a school assignment. Grudingly she began reading, then she realized how much she enjoyed it and ravenously read the rest of the book."
4,I like this book!,"The book was about a boy named Marty who found a dog and named it Shiloh, because Marty found him near the Shiloh School House. Marty's father is a mailman so he knows everyone in the town. His father said the dog belonged to Judd Travers, and made him give the dog back to him. Marty found the dog again and made a pen for him. A German Shepherd bit Shiloh on the ear and on the leg. My favorite part is when Marty gets to keep Shiloh. I don't like the part when Judd tricks Marty, even though Marty stands up for himself. If you read this book I hope you like it!"
3,Read Shilo,"The book I have read is called Shilo. It took me 102 minutes and five days to finish. My favorite part was when Marty found a dog by a bridge that the town called Shilo Bridge. When Marty found Shilo he wouldn't go near Marty because the person who had Shilo last didn't treat him well. The part I hated most was when a mean person, who's name was Jud Travis, came to Marty's house and drove off with Shilo. It was so sad I started to cry. Read this book and find out what happens to Shilo and Marty."
5,"WAY 2 GO, MARTY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","Shiloh is one of my favorite animal books. The fact that Marty never gave up to buy and save Shiloh, was amazing! When going out for some shooting practice, young Marty Preston finds a young beagle, whom he names Shiloh. Marty soon finds out that the baby beagle belongs to a man named Judd Travers, who shoots deer out of season, drinks, and abuses his dogs. When Marty and his father go to drop Shiloh off at Judd's, Marty is horrified when he sees what Judd really does to his dogs. ""If he wanders off again, I'll whup the daylights out of him,"" says Judd, kicking the poor animal. What will Marty do? When Marty finds Shiloh, who escaped from Judd, Marty knows he can not just return the poor animal and have him tortured. So Marty builds Shiloh a pen, sneaks him some food, and gives him some exercise. But is Shiloh truly safe? What happens next? Read this great book to find out! WAY TO GO, MARTY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,amazing book,"I really enjoyed this book. I loved the plot and how Marty tries to hide the dog from judd. I would recommend this book to everyone. For all the people who think the author is from alabama because of the writing, its supposed to be like that. The story is from an eleven year old boy who lives in the countries perspective"
4,SHILOH,"SHILOH was a great book. It's about a boy Marty and the dog that belongs to his mean neighbor, Judd Travers. The dog came to Marty because Judd was being so mean to him. Marty wants to keep Judd's dog. He names the dog Shiloh.When Judd comes to get Shiloh back, trouble comes. What's Marty to do? To find out, read this book! by Christian L."
5,Keeps Readers Howlinng For More!!!,"I put off reading Shiloh because I thought I hated dog stories. Then, after enjoying a similar book, I read it and loved it! It's about a boy, Marty, in West Virginia, who's desperate to save runaway dog Shiloh from his abusive owner. A great book that allows you to relate with the main character and gives you a chance to really think.However, for those of you who dislike ""sappy"" books or have a problem with saying I want a beagle too! at the end of it, this is not a book for you. On the other hand, if you like those types of things and are dying to know if Marty gets Shiloh, read and discover..."
5,A Kid's Review,"Shiloh is a very good book! There is this boy named Marty. He has a mom, dad, and 2 sisters. His dad had a really mean friend named Judd.Marty was walking back to his house and he saw this dog. It would not come to Marty. Then he whistled and he came. Marty asked his dad if he could stay. He said, ""No."" Marty put the dog outside, but the dog just stared at Marty. After dinner, Marty went outside and made the dog a cage outside up the hill. A couple of nights later, they heard a high cry from outside. It was the dog. They ran outside and up the hill.Now read the book to see what happens to the dog and see if Marty get to keep him.Reviewed by Mackenzie"
4,Pretty Good,"I liked the part where the horse gets run over by the werewolf. I also enjoyed reading about flying pigs. Overall, the book was interestingl."
1,Not appropriate for kids,This book bothered my children emmensely as it had many bad words in it. The kids were required to read it for school!!!!!!!!!!! What is the world coming to????????
2,I dislike this story.,"This book is about a boy named Marty, a man named Judd, and a dog named Shiloh. Judd had Shiloh, but Shiloh ran away and Marty got Shiloh. I dislike this story because Shiloh gets hurt a lot, and it's not as adventurous as I would have liked it to have been."
2,shiloh review by :gabbie,"SHILOHIn Virginia, while a boy named Marty was walking he found a dog without a name so he named him Shiloh. He didn't know the dog was Judd's. His dad was working to get enough money so they can give the money to there grandma. Marty was hiding Shiloh so they won't give him to Judd then his mother found out and his mom didn't tell .Then his sister's found out. Then they asked there dad if could have a Shiloh, when he didn't know .When his dad found out Marty begged. His dad said that they can only keep Shiloh for a little while. Marty asked his dad if he could go to work with him to save enough money, so he could buy Shiloh from Judd. Later on Judd found out but Marty asked Judd if he could have Shiloh. BY:GabbieI recommend this book for people who like dogs."
2,An Opinion of Shiloh,"I didn't really like this book, but a 6 or 7 year old might like it better than I did. It is a decent story about a boy and his dog, and a very short book to. It is about a boy named Marty who has a poor family, and hides their cruel neghbor's dog who is being treated badly. I guess it isn't to bad. It also has horrible grammar."
1,Book Review,"I am going to tell you about how I feel about the book Shiloh. This book Shiloh was a confusing book to understand. I guess the author was from Tennesse. The city name was a weird name. The name was Sisterville, the story took place a long time ago. Some parts of the story was good. The words were southern and thats when I could not understand it. I dont think this was the best book I have read. I like new books not old books. It was an ok book. If I could of named the book I would of named the book ""The Dog In The South"". The people that I read this book with did not like it too much either."

1,Shiloh,It is one of my most favorite books.You should read it it's a great book with alot of emotional parts.
5,Title Da Bomb,"By Phillis Renold Nayler I read Shiloh.It was Da Bomb.Its about a kid named Marty who one day sees a beagle near an old school house named Shiloh the dog was owned by a bad man named Judd Travers.Judd treats Shiloh so bad you will hate Judd by the middle of the book!And he curses at his dogs,drinks beer to much,he hunts deer out of season ,kills doe and is very very mean.Marty loves animals and does not like and does not like hunting and when he sees Judd kill a doe it makes Marty sick.Read this book I guarantee you will like it."
3,A Fun Book to Fall Into!!!,"Shiloh, by Phyllis Reynalds Naylor,it's about a fun dog named Shiloh and Judd Travers is shiloh's owner. Marty wants to buy shiloh but Judd says,""He's not for sell.""so Marty convences him to sell for more than he bought him.It is an O.K. book because I'm not into comedy and action I'm into more or just action. That's why it is not my favorate."
4,Shiloh,"Shiloh was an interesting book in some parts. The book is about a boy growing up in Sistersville, Tennessee. He has a mom, dad and two sisters. Along the way a new character is introduced, Shiloh, an abused dog. Along the way Shiloh and Marty cross each others path. The book is exciting and fun. I would give this book four stars. The author did pay a lot of attention to the characters detail. The ending of the story was a shock to the reader of this review. I recommend this bookit to you."
4,A very interesting book!,"This book Shiloh really moves you inside, especially when you read what a mean man does to Shiloh(The dog this book is about). The book is all about a boy and a dog. One day Marty was out and he sees a dog. When he finds out that the dog belongs to a man that abuses this dog he doesn't want to give him up. Marty has to find a way to get the dog or even to buy the dog. DO YOU THINK HE WILL GET THE DOG? Read this book and all about the relationship between a boy and man's best friend."
4,Shiloh,"Shiloh is the first book in Phyllis Reynolds Naylor's trilogy about Marty and Shioh, a beagle that he rescues from Judd Travers, a man who abuses his hunting dogs.The story is set in Friendly, WV and is told by Marty who finds Shiloh and is determined that Judd Travers does not deserve such a wonderful dog. His father makes him return the dog to Judd Travers the first time he finds him, but the second time Shiloh runs away, Marty hides him for a week before he is caught.This is a great series that offers many important subjects that can be discussed with your child."
4,A boy who went crazy about a dog,"Shiloh is a very interesting book. It is the first book in the Shiloh series. The book is based on a kid called Marty who finds a beagle and names it Shiloh. After one of his neighbors, Judd, comes looking for the dog because it's his. Marty will do anything to to keep the dog, but sometimes he goes too far. In my opinion this book is full of suspense and love. I would recommend this book to anyone that can read because it's good for all ages. I would give this book a four star rating."
4,gotta read it,"I gave the book Shiloh four stars because I thought Shiloh was a really good book for those of us who like dogs. The part that really stood out to me was the perserverance he had to keep the dog. For example, when he had to sneak out in the middle of the night to feed Shiloh. The part that was funny to me was when Jud Traverse fell over a rabbit trap and got it caught on his bottom. Over all, the book Shiloh would be a great book for anyone to read."
3,It wasn't so bad,"It wasn't so bad The book Shiloh showed me what it is like to love animals.He fed Shiloh,made a house for him,cleaned him,and played with him.All in all it was a pretty good book."
4,Marty's dog,"This is a wonderful story about a boy named Marty and a dog named Shiloh. Marty has wanted a dog all of his life, and finally , when he discovers a dog in his yard, he doesn't want to give him up. Marty goes through a horrible time trying to keep Shiloh a sercret from his friends and neighbors. Read this inspiring story to find out about a young boy's determination to save this dog."
4,Great Book!,"ShilohThe book Shiloh, a realistic fiction book, is a great book. Shiloh, by Phyllis Reynolds Naylor is about this boy, Marty, who found a dog. [...]Naylor made the characters in her book as real as she could. With Marty, the main character, you can hear what he is thinking. You can't literally hear him think, but the book says what he is thinking. If you have read Jade Green, also by Naylor, you probably know what I am saying.This book is all about animals. It talks about animal abuse and how to try and help animals that were abused. All through the book Marty knows Judd Travers is abusing Shiloh, the meanest guy in town. He tries to tell his parents but they will not believe him. So they give Shiloh back to get more abused.Shiloh is a very touching book. I suggest that you read it. Any body would really like it. It would be especially be good if you love animals."
4,I loved this book!!,"I chose this book because I saw the movie and loved it. I wanted to see the differences in the book and the movie. I love dogs so after seeing the cover and reading the summary I knew I would enjoy this book.One day, Marty was walking home and saw that a dog was following him, he soon found out that it was Judd Travers dog and he knew he was going to keep it no matter what it took.My favorite character was Marty because of his bravery and determination shown in the book.My favorite part of the book was when Judd gave in to Marty and let him keep Shiloh, but he still made Marty work really hard to earn him.I recommend this book to anyone who loves dogs and had a southern accent."
5,Thomas and Tayler's Review,"We thought that Shiloh was an excellent book! The characters include a young boy named Marty and his parents. There is also a mean man named Judd who has a dog named Shiloh. First, Shiloh starts to follow Marty. That's where it all started. Judd is hurting Shiloh, so Marty tries to stop him. Most of the things in the book are sad, but we still thought that it was a nice story. We thought that the way that the characters spoke was really cool. It is neat because they speak differently than we do in Delaware. Overall, we really liked the book Shiloh, but you will have to read it yourself to find out!"
4,I thought this book showed the responsibilities of a child.,"I thought that ""Shiloh"" showed that there is a lot of responsiblitily being a child, and that a child can be, and sometimes must be very independent."
4,Really showed people how animals are a needed part of life!,"I thought this book was good. It showed how animals in general are needed. It also showed how we our pets are sometimes abused or ignored. And that some one in the world would love to have that animal, but instead your kicking it around. So that is what I thought."
5,THIS WAS THE BEST BOOK I EVER READ,I LOVED THE BOOK SHILOH IT WAS SO ADVENTUROUS. MY FAVORITE PART WAS WHEN MARTY GOT SHILOH. AT FIRST IT WAS GOOD THE MIDDLE WAS KIND OF GOOD BUT THE END WAS THE BEST. I LIKE ANIMALS SO YOU KNOW THAT I LIKE SHILOH THE BEST.
1,A parent's review: Good dog.,"1991. It is imperative that Newbery Award Winners attack White males, so this book does.Rural adult white males in this book are:1) distant2) remote3) disapproving4) terrifyingRural white society in this book is closed, secretive, and often violent. Rural white families are terrified of the fathers. We see this in the protagonist Marty's family, and in the antagonist Judd's family.Good dog in this book.The author displays antipathy to fathers, men in general, and rural people. There is a LOT of cursing in this book. Dammit, God, Jesus, and even using Jesus's name to curse a friend if he discloses a secret. Yikes.What are boys supposed to grow up to be? Who are girls supposed to grow up to marry? The books you give your children come with your unspoken sanction. Think before you Newbery -- the Newbery people are notoriously anti-family."
3,Shiloh,"The book Shiloh is based in a real small town. It's about a kid named Marty who finds dog which is a little beaten up. He brings him home, and his parents find out and tell him to give it back. They think it belongs to Judd, a mean and somewhat old drunk. Marty later on gets Shiloh and hides him up in the woods. He will do anything to keep the dog away from Judd, because he knows he beats the dog. To find out what happens next, you'll have to read the book. Will Judd find out, and if he does what will he do?This is part one of the series. I wouldn't recommend this book to adults. It's more of a children's book, but anyone can read this book, which is written by Phyllis Naylor. This book won the Newberry Medal. So go out and live the adventures of Shiloh!"
5,My Review,"Shiloh is a very interesting book. It has drama, relationships, and hate. Marty is a very important character in the book. The end of the book has very different parts from the beginning. Really exciting stuff happens on every page of the book!If you like dogs and a long tale of personalities you would like this book. If you don't like dogs, you will love them now!"
2,Not So Hot,"I'm a huge French pop fan. Sylvie Vartan simply didn't have the canon of songs like France Gall's or Francoise Hardy's. Her singing was fair. Even Brigitte Bardot, who could barely sing, had top notch material written by Serge Gainsbourg. Sylvie's material, on this CD anyway, isn't so hot."
3,reading this one I expect to get something new,I'm tired of books of religion. But reading this one I expect to get something new. But I didn't... again the same thing and nothing especially new. Sometimes I think that almost all books about religion were writting using carbon paper... So now I read book about spirituality but without religion. For example for beginners will be good a crossing or the drop's history by Anatoliy Obraztsov!
5,Mystery of the Christos,"The book was in very good condistion when I received it I haven't got to read it yet there are other books on my list that I have to read for my coures I'm takeing. I have alot more books to buy so I will be coming back for more of the same because the books you buy here are like brand new. Rev. Eugene D. Barbaro, D.D."
3,excellent resource...,"...merely a tool, which definitley involves work on behalf of the reader. There are no pictures or test tiles to rely on; you have to try them yourself... a refreshing change from the results usually included in glaze books because you have to experiment and come up with your own results. I used the 1970's edition of this book as an undergraduate, which included the original recipes - not revised to exclude toxins - and while the revised edition is informative, it lacks the conversions for the ""toxic"" ingredients which many of us still use for the stunning results they provide. As a result some of the best recipes have been excluded from the new edition, and unfortunatley, the replacements and substitutions produce nowhere near the results gained from earlier editions. Still a good tool for the potter who enjoys glaze experimentation, but if you can score a copy of an unrevised edition(there are two- and they are out of print), you are sure to be pleased!"
2,Lots of details but very few illustrations.,"I was disappointed by this book due to the lack of illustrations even if only of test tiles. If the author has tested these formulae I cannot understand why these illustrations were not included, but without them the reader is left having to conduct his own test to determine the effects achievable. If the author has not tested, then the book is little better than the lists of glazes available free on the internet. Either way the reader is left with a lot of work to do."
1,"very promising , but delivers little .","Many of these glazes are from other sources , same for clay bodies , but have been altered slightly to be presented anew. No real emphasis on glaze toxicity . Fritting Barium and Lead does not guarantee safety in the finished glazes . It's a case of user be aware . No guidelines for glaze usuage on functional wares or decorative . Is the glaze able stand table use - who knows ? Another in the long line of Artistic Glaze books , Ho Humm."
4,Technical book,"I'm not an expert in formulating and assembling glazes. But, I wanted to have enough information to do so when I had time to look into it more thoroughly.This book is not entertainment, there are no pictures and it doesn't lead a newcomer by the hand and educate. It's more a recipe book, a listing of components to assemble to make a particular glaze. It's an amazing compendium, but geared toward those with depth in the discipline.I look forward to exploring it, but don't have the expertise to make it readily accessible now."
2,Don't believe the hype!,"I love Spike Lee movies --- ""Do the right thing,"" ""The 25th Hour,"" and ""Clockers, but this book by Kaleem Aftab is shallow and meanders to the point of infuriating. At best it's a surface portrait of a complex man and his films. The book is an easy read, but never delves into the complicated world that Lee has created on and off screen."
4,Good Read,A good historical novel. It is not quite as good as the first two of this series but still worth reading.
4,Opal Revview,"Opal was a young lady who embodied a rough and tumble cowboy. In all four books, a character was running away or trying to find themselves. I liked that in this book, the person who was running away was a man. Sometimes women are the main focus for searching and facing troubles, but all people need to seek the Lord for His plan. I thought it was a good way to tie Opal to the main male character. I did think that she is too young in this book to be the focus of the romance connection, but time plays out nicely in the next book. Remember reader, GOD has HIS great plan for you! Conform to Him and not who or what society may say. He has known best for your life, long before you had life. God bless!!!"
4,Dakotah series,I have enjoyed the entire Dakotah Treasures series. They are an easy read and entertaining. Something you won't mind your teenage daughter reading.
2,Opal's not as good as the first 2,"I felt like this book was sort of choppy. It completely skips Belle's reaction to Dove House burning down, which I thought would be great to see. With all of the different stories that kind of seem to pop out of nowhere, the book seemed more difficult to read. The preacher and his son were kind of interesting, but I didn't think a man that age should be interested in any way with a fourteen year old, even if he thought her a bit older. I do like that Ruby and Rand have a strong faith and show it constantly. I just felt like this book was missing what the first two had."
2,What Happened to Belle? Slow Moving 3rd Edition,"I loved the first two books, Ruby and Pearl. I have to affirm many of the other reviews. Opal's character grew up quite a bit in this book, but she seemed much older than a 14 year old. I also didn't like the match between Opal and the preacher. Their personalities just never seemed to fit. My biggest grudge with this book was that Belle's story was completely written out. She was such an integral part of the first two books. I have a hard time believing she would have just walked away from all her money (that burned at the end of book 2) and the dove house without some sort of fight. Belle's fire and spark is part of the reason I loved the first two books so much. I also didn't understand why Ruby briefly talked about her savings when everything they had burned in the dove house. Just didn't make sense. I'm not the type to walk away from a series, but I just don't think I go drag my self through the 4th."
2,Left me empty,"The author jumped around and I had trouble keeping track of what was going on. Was she introducing new characters where they did not belong just to make them a part of some old gang? Maybe I should have read the author's other books to be able to follow better. I must say, in addition, I was extremely disappointed in the ending which left me empty and feeling as if something was definitely missing! Did she have to cut something out in her revisions? Would not recommend Opal. My daughter read it after me and said the same thing."
3,"Good, but less than the two previous","Opal is only 14, so some of her actions seem out of place and much older, but nonetheless, she is very sincere and has suffered tremendous guilt from the unfortunate scene that opens the book. Opal feels guilty because so many other fine people suffer because of her mistake.I had trouble keeping track of the stories the author jumped between until they all sort of became one story. It was rather difficult to introduce new characters and then have them to become part of the old gang, but it turned out ok to do so in that manner.Ruby and Rand continue to be the Christian backbones of this family and lead their extended families and hands to the knowledge of Jesus Christ as Saviour whenever possible.Parts of this book were TOO predictable, others were totally surprising, and all in all, I did enjoy this book 3."
5,Opal,"Opal is a compelling read. Laurane Snelling is knowledgable, not only of ranching in the Bad Lands, but every aspect of life in Dakota homesteading. Her characters are so real that they move into your life."
3,Easy style but disappointed,"Although I enjoyed the writer's style, and the subject matter, I was let down by the way it left me. I would read more of Snelling's books, however."
2,Disappointed,"We were disappointed with this product. Your home thermometer will have as many features as this. The rain gauge is just a little cup, it's not nearly as nice as the ones at the dollar store. It can tell you temp & humidity, but the wind speed is not even close to being right. My son was excited to take it out on a very windy day, the tv said gusts up to 40 mph and this registered them as 6 mph. bummer."
2,not best quality,"Not best quality and comes without the stand. The very first picture that you see when you enter the product page on amazon is this hammock with the stand; however, pay attention. This hammock comes WITHOUT the stand. Something I didn't think of reviewing in the product description and bought it. Now I'm stuck with it. I think this is how this company sells their products. You buy one, now you are forced to buy the other for a much higher price. This is definitely false advertising.I contacted the company and explained my situation. Their response was ""amazon does not let us put notes on the pictures"". Come on! Use Photoshop to add text to the photo, it only takes 2 minutes!"
5,just as promised!,"This is a nice hammock! In fact, I could spend the day there.. the ropes are soft, yet strong, no knots, dries quickly when it got rained on.It comes with two 12"" chains and two ""S"" hooks, so you will need a couple of screw hooks to hang this between trees. Shipping was speedy too, I ordered the hammock on a monday, and it arrived on wednesday."
3,Get what you pay for,"Get what you pay for. I was looking for an inexpensive replacement for hammock whose ropes were rotting from weather and wear. Perfect for what I was looking for. Not perfect if you are looking for a perfect hammock because there are splices and knots that hold some of the ropes together. The splices effect the visual aspect more than causing any discomfort. Good value, just not a high-end product."
3,hammock,"the hammock arrived in good condition, while it fit my hammock stand the hammock stretched too much for me to use it even after making some manual adjustments, was only able to use it once in my hammock stand even though the measurements were the same as my old one."
2,"too long, stretches out","Ordered this hammock along with an arc hammock stand. According to the measurements, it should have fit, but it has turned out to be too long. Also, it stretches out A LOT when you are in it. And there is no way two people can be in it without touching the ground. It might be okay between trees, but not with a stand. It does dry quickly."
3,Too big,"This hammock is way too big. We loved the width but the length was too long and the weave is too big. During use, the weave will stretch out so much that a child's head can fit through easily."
1,"""Hammock on the Ground, Hammock on the Ground . . .""","I'm amazed at the diversity of opinions about this product - we've got to be receiving different versions of this hammock. 80 pounds (haven't tried less yet) on my hammock drops you spine-first, right down on the stand. The price and soft cords would be nice if not for the drop, which makes everything else about the hammock useless. It is unusuable, to the point that I wouldn't feel comfortable trying to sell it to someone else unless they took a ride on it first. Before you buy it, envision yourself kicking your brand new hammock to the curb with the cans, a week after receiving it. I hope the seller can get the consistency straight, as I'd love to buy the 5 star version at this price."
1,This is not polyester as advertized,"All the specifications for this item indicate it is polyester and will hold up better in damp climates, but I received a cotton Hammock. Gave the seller this feedback but have not received any response. Not recommended."
3,not a bad deal!,"This is a nice hammock for the price- certainly very large, although the spaces between the ropes can be large enough to stick a foot through, that's not neccessarily a bad thing. It's comfortable enough for a nice long nap, and seems to be built well enough to withstand some weather. One concern- it's long! I have a very large hammock stand and it's barely long enough to hang this hammock without it hitting the ground. Be sure you've got enough space to hang this!"
1,Inexpensive and cheaply made,I would not recommend this item. The weave is very loose and does not offer much support. I plan to send mine back for a refund.
5,well worth it!,"I was skeptical because of the price. I didn't think it would be really durable if even useful. BUT, It has done well so far and my kids really like it and use it all the time. We don't bring it in when it rains, so I don't know how long it will last, but if it lasts the summer and part of next year, I would buy another because it is really comfortable."
1,Useless,"The price seemed right, but the amount I paid for this (on sale) was wayyyy too much. My model literally couldn't pick up the little peices of paper from a hole-puncher on my desk (or on my carpet). When I first used the carpet sweeper attatchment I thought it was working but it turned out that all the dirt was just getting picked up in the brush (that is, until the brush was full). The manual said it would work better after a few charges but I've put some serious socket/ carpet time into this vacuum with no results. Don't waste your money."
1,"Seriously, this book is not good!","I'm a sexuality speaker and educator. I thought it might be fun to get this book as a reference since I usually speak to thousands of students each year.This book is bad. I'm surprised it is in it's 2nd edition because it is basically just a bunch of ""dear abby"" type of questions and short answers.Save your money and skip getting this book."
4,Overview of quilt history through a collection,This is a nice overview of quilt history as you are taken through photographs of Fox's extensive quilt collection. The quilts are divided up by blocks or style and each section also includes a project based on a block or style. Many stunning quilts pictured here. My favorite is a Wedgewood blue and white colored quilt from 1930 called Lacy Flowers.
3,"Good, not great","I own 34 complete Messiah CD recordings, and various excerpts and vinyl versions. In my view, this recording is world-best at only three points: Kathleen Battle's ""If God Be For Us"" and ""And Lo the Angel of the Lord"", and the final ""Hallelujah"", which I splice on to the otherwise better second Marriner version. Battle's ""Rejoice"" is fine, but she uses exactly the same concept in three recordings, and her execution here is the weakest of the three. She does it better on her recital disk with Marriner, and better still on her ""Grace"" recital disk. I find Ramey disappointing; such a great voice, but no intensity in this music, and his ""eye"" sound is too much like ""oy"". The other soloists, as well as the chorus and orchestra, are competent but not remarkable. For other modern-instrument Messiahs, either of the Davis or Marriner recordings are better,and Westenberg is supreme, as is the Shaw choral excerpt disk from 1966."
5,Voices that Reached Heaven!,"I have never heard such a wonderful rendition of Handel's Messiah. The choir and orchestra were magnificent, and what can you say about Kathleen Battle -- her angelic voice touches your soul and lifts your spirit in this most excellent presentation.I will highly recommend this CD set to all who love this oratorio."
2,Frustrating,"I don't share the other reviewers' enthusiasm for this performance. To my ear, the chorus is too large and diffuse and the soloists are, conversely, too distant to be emotionally involving.On the good side: the final Hallelujah is the best of my 30 Messiahs, magnificent.Kathleen Battle's ""Rejoice"" is terrific but she uses the same concept with better execution in her recital with Marriner, and better still on her disc ""Grace.""The bass Samuel Ramey has a great voice but his mind seems to be on something else. I prefer Terfel and Herincx on Messiah.Tenor John Aler and alto Florence Quivar have some good moments, but better can be found elsewhere -- including Aler on the Westenberg recording."
5,best ever,This is the best recding of the Messiah I have heard. The balance between the orchestra and the chorus is very good.
4,This is the most extraordinary recording of The Messiah I have ever heard.,"The soloists are all superb, and the orchestration is the best I've ever heard for the piece of work. The box, however was broken, thus the rating of 4."
1,Never received the product.,I can't even rate this. I never received it after waiting for almost a month. There was no tracking information. I had purchased this for a gift and since it never arrived was extremely disappointed.
1,Retire Already!,"Eric Clapton = Most overrated popular musician of the 20th century, and this album only cements that fact. Haven't you sucked the life out of Robert Johnson enough?"
2,what the heck?,"Ok...what is going on here? First of all, you record a cd and put the name of the greatest blues rock guitarist of my generation on it and then you make it sound like Frank Sinatra with a great band behind him?! I am an Eric Clapton fan, you know that guy that can play the blues covers better than anyone and once recorded with BB King? Who is this guy? Come on, give me a break, OVER THE RAINBOW? I mean, OVER THE RAINBOW, isn't that the song that was sung in the Wizard of Oz by this Dorothy chick?...The only thing that saved this cd was whoever was recording it actually did some great EC tunes. I thought I heard a couple of them up until that guy started singing like Sammy Davis Jr. doing some Howlin' Wolf covers. Please, whoever you are, do not do this again."
5,"Amazing, Clapton is great","I've gotta give this CD a five star rating, because I've always loved Clapton, not to mention I went to the concert when he was doing this tour, and it was amazing. ""River of Tears"" is one the highlights of the entire thing, it's very very good. It's true, he is mellowing out nowadays, and ""Layla"" is a little more mellow compared to the original, but hey, it's ""Layla,"" who cares, if you're a Clapton fan. I highly recommend this CD and DVD, it was a very awesome concert."
5,great package!!!!,"This is as good of a price I could find online and both shows and plays perfectly'Will return to this ""trader"" again!!!!!!"
3,Too mellow !,"Eric, I love ya. Heck, I own every audio CD you've made. Unfortunately, One More Car/Rider doesn't have what Eric does best, and that's play guitar. Key To The Highway is pretty good. There's a couple others that are pretty good. None are great. Where's the fire? Where's the passion? The last song is ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow"" - on the same CD as ""Cocaine"", lol - and this kinda sums up this performance. It's not the Eric we love.The keyboard playing makes me want to gag. Most of these songs don't have keyboards on the studio tracks. The result is I feel like I'm listening to a lounge act trying to do Clapton, and it's bad. I know Eric's still got the ability. Listen to the Cream reunion CD which is done about 8 years later. It smokes by comparison.I'll keep this CD set in my collection, but sadly it probably won't get much play. I hope for better things you Eric, before you hang up your Strat!"
4,Bell Bottom Highs,"Experiencing Clapton's emotional range and authenticity on ""Bell Botom Blues"" alone is worth the entire price of this album."
3,"So Laid Back, It's Hard To Justify More Than 3 Stars!","One Car, One More Rider is Clapton's first live release since his highly acclaimed ""Unplugged"" Album which was released a little over 10 years ago. This is a two CD release of back material including the acoustic ""Key To The Highway"" and the smooth jazz number ""Reptile"". Unfortunately, for guitarist, the songs sound just a tad bland as the emphasis seems to be on the vocals and the band. ""Have You Ever Loved A Woman"" is probably the best track on the disc although, Clapton is equally in top form on two from his prior incarnation, ""Layla"" and ""Sunshine Of Your Love"". This is not Clapton's finest hour and hopefully not his last."
4,Good but,"This CD just goes to show that Clapton plays his best shows in MSG (this cd was recorded from LA and Tokoyo). Clapton is my favorite of all time, its just that this album doesnt seem that well organized with the style and sequence of the songs. This is a good cd with some great live preformances, particularly ""Badge"" and ""River of Tears"" one of my new favorites. Bottom line, this is a good album, that you should definately go out and buy, it just could have been more."
4,Eric's Last Live Performance? Running on Faith? Blues Power?,"It's not likely that EC will go intoretirement after his recent world tour. He probably won't do the long drawn out, 8 month long stintsthat he completed in 2001. This is a great performance filmed and recorded at the Staples center in L.A. on the last night of this long tour. The quality of the audio and video is superb with many different camera angles not too many shots of the audience as in Paul Mc's recording here for his latest cd/dvd. I gave this only a 4 star rating because of the lack of more good blues material and the strange rendition of Badge that didn't sound close to the original by Cream. All in all a very nice package for EC fans!"
2,Not the best Clapton,"The man is a master, doubts there, but this CD was really not the best Clapton I've ever heard. Everything was a huge production and I can understand that for concert goers, but frankly it ruined some really great classics; especially Claptons blues covers and his signature Layla. I was really hoping for some great tunes from this CD but I think I'm better off listening to some of the past works Mr. Slow Hand has done."
4,We needed this,We needed this for our small buisness. We bought this for a reference book it is a good one...
5,AWESOME,"Great little speakers. Easy install. Mounted mine under the eves of my shed. The sound will carry over 300 ft and still sounds clear. If you stand right under them they sound a little tinny, but other than that an excellent addition to any back yard"
1,NOT the right edition - get the DOVER,"Riis was before all else a photojournalist, and this his major body of work. As such, the fact that there even exist editions which do not contain quality reproductions of the photos astounds me. This edition only contains a few, and they are small, pixelated, two-tone reproductions. The Dover edition is the one to get."
4,Missing the iconic Jacob Riis pictures,"The overall presentation of the book is fine. I use it as a teaching tool ... (a read aloud in my High School History classes). For me, just a few passages are necessary to get the point across to my students. But, I WISH it had the famous Jacob Riis pictures. There are only a few published in the book."
5,Toughest Time,Source book for Luc Sante's research into his book- Low Life:The Lures and Snares of Old New York. Current Affairs journalism in it's infancy. Tenement laws and building codes in New York were first manifested as a result of this book's original publication. Riis ruled.
1,horribly translated from paper to e-book,"I needed to buy this book for school, and decided to get the kindle edition because it was cheaper. And boy, was it cheap. I can barely understand half of what's written! the translation was very badly done, resulting in incorrect wording, words mushed together, and words that aren't even real words. I've requested a refund, because this is not worth the money, AT ALL.Stay away from this edition!! Find a different one, or just buy it in print. This version is definitely not worth the headaches."
2,Too dated to really make an impact,"Yes, the stories in this book are depressing. Yes, they are still happening even today. However, Riis's writing style is quite sensantionalist, it had me rolling my eyes every paragraph or so. And he is quite prejudice against a whole multitude of races and religions. Again, yes I know this was written in 1890, but the sheer volume of his judgement against other cultures, etc. really took me out of the core stories of the conditions of the people detailed in the book.A fair amount of the book had me interested, it's just the way the stories were told made me not be able to disgest their content very well."
1,horrendous edition,"This edition of How the Other Half Lives is astoundingly bad. It contains innumerable typos (the edition was clearly the result of scanning an old edition with sub-par OCR software). Moreover the illustrations and tables are 72dpi maximum making them a nearly illegible blur on the printed page. The blurb on the back claims the book was ""first published in 1901"" (in fact it was 1890). The same amount of care went into this edition as went into a New York Tenement."
1,Kindle Edition of How the Other Half Lives,No one should download this version to their Kindle because it is a complete mess. It needs to be REMOVED as an option. Thank you.
1,Wrong edition.,"We all know the story, which can be found in any edition of this book-- and yes, they will all have typos, as the book was never originally put through a rigorous editing process. That's part of it's 'charm.'The problem, though, is this specific edition--many images are left out, and the images really make the book; after all, Jacob Riis was one of the first muckraking photojournalists... wouldn't you want to see those pictures? They add incredible depth to the story. Luckily I had to read this for a class, and didn't mind it, but... for someone reading it for personal purposes, spend the few extra dollars for an edition with photographs. It is SO worth it."
4,very disturbing and also the truth and and now today,If you read this you'll be done and what's really sad the same game is going on today. I my eyes have seen these conditions today's america I recommend this book. Great price.
3,Misspellings throughout,"Lots of spelling mistakes throughout, choppy publication of paragraphs (spaces where there should be none) and the pictures were not of very good quality. But, for 8.00 dollars I shouldn't have expected much more.It is a good read though and brings real insight into NYC and the mentality of that era."
1,So many typos!,"There are tons of typos in this specific version of this book. It makes it really difficult to read, and this is already a dry book. Look for a different version if you don't want to get frustrated by a poorly made book."
5,"""No One Buys Female Figures"" ... yeah ... sure.","I'm told by toy and game industry insiders that it's next to impossible to get the marketing types to understand that there's a HUGE demand for sexy figures of popular fictional female characters. (Maybe they're like the auto industry execs at Ford and GM who keep trying to kill the Mustang, Camaro and Firebird because they don't want to admit how popular muscle cars are, even when they're selling well ... something about selling a type of product they aren't sure is in line with their ""O so conservative image ... anyway ...) The fact that such figures sell out in record time seems inadequate evidence to make the case and so it can be hard to find such figures in stores even short days after they hit the street. I purchased this one as a gift for someone who is one of a growing army of adult collectors of such fun figures and he loved it. If you can find it (currently unavailable) ... it's a keeper."
2,"poor video, ok performances","I remember Paul Badura-Skoda from the 50's and 60's, kind of a journeyman pianist recording for the old Westminster label.I usually prefer to have concertos NOT conducted by the soloist, and the results speak for themselves here.These are just average run-throughs, pleasant enough, but nothing exciting. The sound is good enough but the picture doesn't seem sharp, and the video production very amateurish, like they didn't have enough cameras.The program is spread over two dvds, which is wasteful, since the whole thing takes less than two hours. Seems like a ruse to make you think you're getting a two-for-one deal.The accolades in the booklet declaring Badura-Skoda as ""one of the greatest pianists of our time"" seems self-serving and highly exaggerated.If you want Mozart piano concerti, Buchbinder/VPO on Euroarts dvds are much better."
1,The one book I'll return,"Healthy? Almost all of the cake and cookie recipes call for eggs -- usually a minimum of 3 and most 6 or even 12! They have to be separated, so egg substitutes aren't an option... Convenient? If you happen to have 4 cups of dried apricots, maize flour and 3 cups of ground nuts to go in the 12 egg recipe... Thorough and tested? By the way, the recipe that lists apricots as an ingredient doesn't ever USE the apricots..."
1,This is one bad cookbook!,"I just hate wasting my time trying to make a recipe from a cook book like this. For one thing, the author says things like, ""Put batter in a pan."" Um, what size pan?? And she makes no recommendations for which sweetener she uses for each recipe. Well, a half cup of raspberry jam used as a sweetener is going to have a whole different taste than a half cup of rice syrup. I have made one recipe from the book and it's a disaster; there was obviously a typo, probably in the amount of flour she says to use. I don't recommend this book to anyone."
4,Speedy Delivery,"Got my book on time. Some of the pages are falling out, but I didn't expect too much for a 50 cent book. Thanks."
5,Great Watch at a GREAT price!,I am very pleased with the watch! Great price was a real plus! Easy to read as well as comfortable!
4,buena calidad,"Hola gracias por su producto muy buena calidad y por su total atencion y puntualidad; muy agradecida con ustedes me gusta mucho su servicio doy el visto bueno en todo a lo que a ustedes se refiere; sin mas que decir me despido de ustedes hasta una proxima ocacion, saludos...."
1,YUCK,"I spent more for shipping than the product cost and got dried, brown tasteless stuff like sawdust.I definitely would not buy this again. I wanted a true lemon taste to put on fish and vegetables.This is not fit to use for any reason I can think of."
2,Crude Politics: Biased journalist,"Though I'm somewhat impressed with the author's access to facts, I'm dismayed at his illogical use of them. Anyone in this country who depends on trucks, that transport food and all consumer goods and necessities, ought to be concerned with the price we pay for gasoline in this country. If we allowed the terrorists to control the production of middle eastern oil, I hope anyone who votes against President Bush, will be happy paying somewhere around $6-8.00 per gallon of gasoline. A vote for J. Kerry will do that to us. Remember these words."
3,A Compelling Mess,"I decided to have a go at a Richard Laymon novel after reading many positive reviews of his work here on amazon.com. After finishing DARK MOUNTAIN, I can say this book is a compelling mess of genres: outdoor adventure, teen romance, witchery and mayhem. The end result is kind of like a novelized EC Comic, with its pulp elements and lurid appeal firmly in place. Laymon does have a morbid, juvenile obsession with the female anatomy and rape that seems to carry through his work. At times, it makes for uncomfortable reading, so be warned if you're sensitive to female exploitation. Overall, an exciting page turner, perfect for a cold Winter's night."
4,Camping Fun!,"This was a very summery-fun type of book. It wasn't my favorite of his... The ending felt a little rushed. It was still a fun read, just not his best work. It followed the same lines as _Darkness, Tell Us_. It was a fun, summer thriller set primarily around a fateful camping trip."
3,"Previously published as ""Tread Softly"" by Richard Kelly","""Dark Mountain"" was previously published under the title ""Tread Softly."" Richard Laymon used the pen name ""Richard Kelly"" for ""Tread Softly"" and ""Midnight's Lair.""""Dark Mountain"" is a very good novel with a great first third. The middle section is just okay. The final third includes a strong finish.The first third is fantastic. There are many likable characters. Although I'm eager for action, I also dreaded it in a way because it would likely result in good characters being injured or killed.The climactic scene that ends the first third of the book is probably the most horrifying scene I have ever read."
1,Trying to like Horror novels.,"Okay, I hope I'm not stepping on anyone's toes but this novel sucks. Laymon wastes soooo much time on mintutia that it leaves me wishing he was an actual HORROR writer. I don't care about ""little moments,"" but, dude, get to the friggin point! Should have been about 100 pages, and that would have been pushing the envelope. Peeee-youuuu!"
3,Did Richard Laymon Really Write This Book?,"I have read quite a few Laymon books and this book is very different. The characters are good, but the story was slow at times. I skimmed past many pages because they dragged on and lacked the suspense and fast paced style of other Richard Laymon books. This is a book worth reading, but a die hard Richard Laymon fan will proberbly be disappointed. The books writing style is similar to Stephen King and Dean Koontz."
5,Wonderful book!,"I bought this at the suggestion of my flute teacher, and, WOW, has it made an impact on my playing! She takes you through an evolving awareness of the body & how different parts (arms, spine, muscles) all work together towards playing more effectively and with less chance of injury. Was very easy to understand with lots of diagrams. I find myself returning to different sections of the book as I face different issues with my playing. A must-have for any flutist!"
4,Show Me The Wrath,Great band.Incredible Bay Area styled Thrash circa 1986.Absolutely uncanny how much this band sounds like LEGACY / TESTAMENT on this record.Especially considering they're from Chicago.
3,A bit on the heavy-handed side,"TV-movie treatment of hate crime in Montana. A multi-cultural community is harassed by neo-Nazis. Cartoon cut-out bad guys go up against generally likable innocents such as the Jewish family that figures centrally in the story. A bit simplistic, but well-meaning. Just about every minority that's been persecuted in the last century - whether in the U.S. or abroad - has been squeezed into this drama. I'd wait for it to appear on TV again - or rent it. Not worth the considerable price."
1,worked for only 14 days,"It was fast. But worked for only 14 days, then it's physically broken, sounded like a broken electric saw. Since Maxtor claims they are not responsible for any data damage, I think my files are forever gone. Besides noise (which is tolerable though), this drive was way too hot, I guess the accumlated heat finally killed it."
2,what a waste,I chose that rating cause I truly feel that they could've done a better job showing hendrix's visionas an artist of that era. They never delved into his personal feelings about his own music and they also never mentioned how he felt trapped between his Contracts with ppx industries all of his legal problems with his record companies. And the music that wasn't hendrix was terrible.
3,Decent - Warts and All,"Reviewer Rex Marksmanson ""HEYO!"" sums it up pretty well. Worth a read.Catch the movie on pay-per-view if you don't want to buy the DVD, but see it, if only for the solid, heartfelt performance by Wood Harris.RIP Jimi."
4,"Great movie, shows the reality of many stars","This movie is a biography of the life of Jimmy Hendrix. It is as interesting as it is sad.It shows how he pursued his dream about seeing no colors and finding the disapproval of the black community. It also shows how badly he was exploited, similar to Janice Joplins, and how he had talent but really no control over his life. His manager was the one who ran it.Anyhow, it shows how this is one of the loneliest lives, as he was surrounded by women and people, but none of them really gave a care about him.I give it a 4 star, because it only plays a few of his hits."
2,Typical TV Movie,"This made-for-cable movie is an honest attempt to boil down Jimi Hendrix's life and music down to less than two hours. Unfortunately the producers were unable to obtain the rights to any of Jimi's songs, so the musical score is entirely made of up his covers (Hey Joe, All Along the Watchtower, Wild Thing, etc.) plus some unattributed jamming. You get the typical 60s montages (JFK, Malcom X, the Beatles, Dylan, etc.) along with the cookie-cutter dialogue and vastly oversimplified story.Despite some good performances, the script doesn't really offer the scope to examine why Hendrix's music was so revolutionary, or the problems that led to his early death.There's not much fire here, either, as the film suffers from wooden pacing and is never especially absorbing.The documentary film ""Jimi Hendrix"", also available on DVD, is a far better way to gain an appreciation of this artist."
2,HE IS JIMI DAMMIT,Jimi was Jimi not Hendrix that they chose to call the movie by his last name should have been a tip off that they didn't love him like we did. The best guitarist there ever was. Rock on.
1,Not so good,"I can't understand why this movie was made, it can't be about the guitar playing genius Jimi Hendrix, they skipped over that. If Jimi Hendrix was a famous clothing designer this movie would have made more sense.Imagine making a film about Gene Kelly and giving the lead to someone who can't dance, BUT TRIES,........disgraceful. I only hope the people responsible for this film were punished severly, Jimi deserves better. I can see why the Hendrix estate refused the original music to the makers of this piece of garbage, they must have known it was doomed.Anyone involved in the direction of this film should be banned from the universe, it really is that bad. All the bad reviewers are right on."
1,Yuck,"Caught this flick on cable tonight and all I can say to any Hendrix fan considering a purchase should SKIP IT! If you have to see it out of curiousity then rent it. Other negative reviews have detailed some of the problems, but what must be stressed here is the lack of quality music.Hendrix was a great musician, but here you have a film about a musician whose music is not highlighted. I particularly hated the way Wood Harris played Jimi. Why the producers felt it most important to find someone that sort of looked like Hendrix regardless of talent I'll never know. Harris' lack of talent was the reason for the MTV fast cut, mocumentry style camera work which is particularly annoying.Bottom line: Poor soundtrack, poor acting, poor screenplay. This film should never have been made."
4,This was a very good film,I couldn't believe how well they portrayed Jimi Hendrix in the film. Its a story of his life. The guy who played Hendrix in this movie did a great job acting like Hendrix. Well Done.Very touching ending.
1,Kindle version is worthless,"Because I already own The Red Pocket Book of Spanish Verbs in hardcopy I didn't bother to sample it first. That was a mistake I'll never make again. The hardcopy book is a wonderful and useful reference, but the Kindle version is so poorly formatted that it is virtually unusable. This is an egregious example of a publisher simply converting from paper to electronic format with no thought to the differing requirements of the two media! Trying to look up a single verb is nearly impossible."
3,great layout; not as comprehensive as i expected,"this book is good at doing what it's supposed to do (conjugating in all tenses) with the verbs it provides, but its selection of verbs is questionable. why include 'publicar' (to publish, publicize) and not include 'olvidar/olvidarse' (to forget)? it does have an english-spanish verb index and a more comprehensive spanish verb index in the back, though in the former it doesn't list the translation of 'to discuss', which seems like a common enough verb to me. there's also an irregular verb form index which i haven't referred to yet. it's a small book, and well laid out and easy to use, but i mean come on."
3,Print too small,"It has been a few weeks sense I returned this book, it seems like I had to buy it too see what it was like. I think this is the one that has tiny unlargeable print, I think that is why I returned it. Thank you Amazon for giving me my money back."
3,"Good figure, but Playmates figures were better","Unlike the Picard figure from the new movie, at least you can look at the face and tell who it's supposed to be.These figures from this new company are decent, but could be better overall as far as articulation, appearance, and overall movement.Decent, but I just can't figure out why Paramount didn't renew the contract with Playmates, who made outstanding line of Star Trek toys over the years."
1,this is VOLUME 2 ONLY! written by another army officer NOT herndon,"This is only volume 2 of the two volume report about the amazon, and vol 1 was written by Herndon, and vol 2 by another army officer on the expedition. not as promised"
2,Spell check city,"This is a absolutely fascinating historical account marred by at least a thousand typos. It was sheer pain to get through. Buyers deserve more for their dollar. Yes, we were warned by the publisher, but the company also wrote that the robot that turned the pages and photographed each page ""is 99 percent accurate."" Wow.By the way, the book reveals that the Herndon article on Wikipedia has faulty dates and does little credit to the daring exploits of a heroic naval explorer."
2,a bit disapointing,"Book is very generalized with little detail of trials and triumphs,rather boring after a while.I was hoping for more details of the amazon valley and its people,you wont find it here."
3,ZARZUELAS,iT IS TOO BAD THAT THE RECORDING WAS POOR FOR A GREAT VOICE. THIS CD HAS THE MOS POPULAR ZARZUELAS SANG BY ONE OF THE BEST SPANISH SINGERS.
4,"""THAT'S RIGHT!"" It's Victor","I've Been following Mr. Bailey ever since his first solo release ""Bottoms Up,"" and he hasn't disappointed me yet.Victor's new release ""That's Right"" contains a few tunes that are stretched too thin with repetition, but for the most part, The album (opps! I mean cd...showing my age!)contains the usual virtuoso musicianship always prevalent on Victor's recordings.Bailey continues to follow the standard set by one of his idols, Jaco Pastorious, with his powerfully understated playing, not choosing to bang you over the head with heavy-handed solos that overwhelm the listener.I was also pleasantly surprised to hear one of Jazz/Fusions great sax players, Bennie Maupin, still in fine form on the tracks ""Nothing But Net"" and ""That's Right,"" while drummer Omar Hakim continues to amaze me with his mastery over the kit."
5,SUPREME MUSICIAN,Victor Bailey is one of the most complete musicians on the planet and this is a burning disk with his great playing and writing. Can't wait for a new effort from him. Watch the Zawinul Sindicate Korg video to further understand Where's Paco ?
1,Bull Shit,"I do not watch television on a schedule, so I miss a lot of programming. It is good that television shows are available on disk now. And it is handy for review later. Penn & Teller use scientific facts to support, or destroy common beliefs and opinions. This is good."
3,Compression Depression,"While not as spectacular overall as the first two seasons, this is still a lot of fun. My lament is that the discs are all single-layer, thus the shows are squeezed down to half the size they should be. Not grotesque, but if you have a large TV you will notice compression artifacts."
4,"Another good season, though not always as fun","What can I say? I really enjoy the series, and while I did disagree with them on a few episodes, I still enjoyed the season. I didn't give it a glowing full rating not because we disagreed. We have a right to disagree, and really, if you're never exposed to viewpoints that challenge your own, your mind becomes really really narrow. I just thought the subjects they tackle weren't as fun, so some of the episodes weren't as fun. Most, however, were pretty enlightening, at least."
2,Bullsh*t gone bullsh*t,"Seasons 1 and 2 of BS were interesting and informative. They would say ""Look at this: It's not what you think it is. Let us show you what we mean.""Season three was basically Penn saying ""Take a look at these idiots."" There are a few things in season 3 that ARE informative, but most of it is either obvious ""Wow, you mean God ISN'T showing up in grilled cheese?"" or opinionated ""Hey, I never finished college, and now I'm rich!""And they included more gratuitus nudity just, I assume, to fit into ""Showtime.""So yeah, BS has jumped the Shark."
4,Live and Honest,"Iron Maiden Live at Donington is a monumental recording of a monumental show. this show has all the rawness and continuity that 'Live After Death' lacks, meaning you get the entire show with no overdubs or cuts. this is Maiden's most honest recording ever. all the other live albums are edited to create a 'nicer' sound, but not this one. this 100% live and its got a great sound quality to it. Also it includes a guest appearence by former guitarrist Adrian Smith on the last song, Running Free, this being the very first time the current lineup played together.I really recomend this album, it a great catalogue from Maiden's oldest songs (Iron Maiden, Running Free etc.) up to the Fear of the Dark album.This CD contains an enhanced multimedia part with videos, photos, images and other nice additions.get this album!"
3,Another live album from maiden...,"This album is one of many live albums from Iron Maiden, personally I think they are a great live band, and Im sure many people agree and thats why they have put so many live records on the market. This one in particular is not their best, the sound is not good, Bruce doestn sound as good as he really is and the songs they play are the ones they always play live. The interactive section is cool, and I would have to agree with the other reviewer that this is what saves this album. If you only get the record for the music, then its not worth it, at least the artwork is great, it comes with many pictures and also with the lyrics, but in the end not Maidens best work, they shouldnt have release this one."
3,So so phone,"I have to say the phones feature set is pretty nice and I do like the ability of expanding the same model thoughout the house with only one base station. I will however say that the couple of refurbished models i have purchased in the past have been nothing but problems. All of them seem to exhibit the same problem after a few months of use. The phones themselves start to lose their ability to keep a charge and even giving it over a day of charging will only give you about 15 minutes of talk time. Please note this is after going through 3 different types of rechargable batteries that are said to work in the book. I have come to the conclusion that the handsets are really the only problem but aside from that the phone works great. I have good reception from within the house and outside but if you choose to buy a refurb beware as most places will only give you 30 days before your warranty expires.Hope this helps,-Duff"
1,Extremely disappointing reception,"The base station works okay. The handset is TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE!! I am sorry I bought this thing. I don't know why there are good reviews on this device as mine barely works well enough to replace two tin cans with string between them. I'm looking for a replacement for the whole system."
1,Looks are deceiving!,"Well, you heard that saying, don't judge a book by it's cover.DON'T BE LURED IN!! This product has lasted two years ( I wanted to squeeze every cent out of it!) but i had to endure a lot of pain, the system's display only works when pressed hard. You need to shake it, for it to work most times and sometimes it cannot find it's home base......searching.....searching.Advice- search for a panasonic model!"
1,poor support from Siemens for this set as it is discontinued,DO NOT buy a refurbished set. Mine lasted just past the 90 day return policy and stopped working. Siemens are not interested in fixing it.
3,"Flexible and feature rich, but time is running out...","I live in an older home with 3 floors and two phone jacks. The Gigaset was a great way to get phones everywhere without having to add wiring. The phone is loaded with features and the family has been actually been able to use most of them. CallerID is a must in a household with teenagers. Sound quality varies, so for important calls I still use a corded model. Time is running out on the Gigaset though. The batteries are standard AA Ni-Cd, but technology moves on and Ni-Cd are getting rare if not impossible to find."
1,0 stars... I do NOT recommend this phone system!,"We have had this system for almost two years -- DO NOT BUY IT! After writing the manufacturer and getting a form-letter response, we still have had no luck. We have the base and 4 cordless extensions, and nothing works right! All of the cordless extensions continually sound like you are underwater or as our callers put it ""have a helicopter flyng above you."" Other times the phones just drop the call. And this is when the batteries are fully charged, although we have also found that they don't hold their charges for long.The phones look cool, but that's all going for this system. Given the price, you would hope for something more functional, better organized (try getting through the answering machine menu... THAT'S a chore!!!), and more reliable. This phone system will NOT work in a cordless environment, is NOT easy to use, and should NOT be purchased!"
2,Poor sound quality mars potentially great phone set,"I concur with ""Electronics fan from NJ"" who wrote his review on the 2415 base unit, which I also bought: the sound quality is a big problem. Background hiss, feedback (hear yourself talking), and dropouts.Also, all the phone's features are accessed through soft menus. This very modal behavior is difficult for many users. If my wife wants to turn off the ringer on the handset, well, she just puts it under a pillow! Commonly accessed features need dedicated buttons.I am returning the 2415 and 2400 I bought, and going back to my 900 MHz Panasonic."
1,"Good looks, good price (refurbished), but poor range and broke quickly","Got this system, the baseset and handsets, but they didn't last much more than about five months. First one handset stopped charging, and then the base unit stopped transmitting. Their range (within a normal sized house) was never all that good either."
3,i hate this system,"this is one of the least user friendly phones i have ever seen. mine broke shortly after warranty, now i have to buy a refurbished handset..."
2,Ambient noise a big problem,"We have a siemens system with five handsets. I am worn out by the extent to which ambient noise is picked up by the speaker, when I'm talking to other people. The microphone should be much more focused on the speaker, not on the room. It's completely aggravating, and very disappointing in such an expensive headset.The menu system for setting up the handset and the transmitter is also annoying, but that's par for the course in these kinds of headsets. I do like the intercom feature and the range is satisfactory, though not stellar."
1,Looking for a replacement...,"I have a base unit and 3 handsets, and in about a year 2 of the handsets died. One was replaced by Siemens under warranty, and the replacement kind of sort of works if you don't mind pressing the buttons real hard and being patient. One hand set was about a month out of warrenty, and I replaced it with a refub unit, which also kind of works - as long as you don't talk longer than 10 minutes, after which time the handset cuts out. The one handset that still works is one that is not used much. The hand sets are not very robust, and I would definitely not buy a Siemens product (again)."
2,Nice features if they would last,"Just as another reviewer mentioned, our cordless often made it sound as if we were talking under water. The cordless handset would not hold a charge very well either. Finally, after less than two years of use, the cordless died on us. The features are what sold us on this phone as we had hoped to use it for both our home and home office. We love the light-weight, slim cordless. The desk phone has great features. However, it's tough to swallow that we spent this much on a phone and the handset didn't last at all. We are left with a desk phone but can't convince ourselves to risk the money on another handset to replace it. Anyone care to buy a couple chargers? :)"
4,Good value.,Every couple of years I have to replace these non-stick pans. My last one was from Calphalon. This time I tried Cuisinart. I really like the other pans of theirs I had purchased. The handle really never gets hot. This is very easy to clean. Don't use metal instruments. Follow the instructions and this will last a while. Best value I could find for the size.
3,lost and found,"This is good album, some of the tunes were never lost, I knew them all along. But they have just a tiny different spin on them. The Crowes continue to rock and this cd is just another example of that."
4,"An Unreleased Gem and a Superior ""Amorica""","This is the Crowes' best recorded work, save for Southern Harmony.""Tall"" is vastly superior to ""Amorica"". I've always liked ""Amorica"", but have long thought the sound was overdone in places. Too many guitars in the mix, distortion, etc. ""Tall"" is leaner, the instruments are clearer and there is more emphasis on group harmonies (band members and backup singers).The less-is-more approach suits this particular set of songs, which includes several that didn't make it on to ""Amorica."" ""Feathers"", ""Dirty Haired Halo"", ""Evil Eye"" and especially the gorgeous ""Thundertstorm 654"" all could have taken the spots of the lesser tunes on ""Amorica"".""Band"" is every bit as good and diverse (albeit much shorter) as ""Tall"" and much better than ""By Your Side"". Each and every tune is first rate Crowes material.Highly reccomended."
4,Black Crowes Rock,"Great rocking album from the Black Crowes. As ususal, they find new ways to rock the house. Lots of fun"
4,Long awaited....,"This is a must have for anyone who is a Stephen King Fan, and certainly a must have for anyone trying to finish this long series. My only complaint is the artwork; the first three volumes (that I read several years ago) were illustrated by someone else. The artwork reflected the dark nature of Roland's world. These new illustrations seem too cartoonish. But, we're here for the story, not the pretty pictures!! Buy this book."
5,Imagination gone wild,I recommend this to anyone that has a vivid imagination and likes the suprise elements waiting to enetertain you in every chapter.
3,Book 5,"I was disappointed in this book. Having read about Roland's past in book 4, I eagerly awaited book 5. Was displeased, but not as much as I was with book 6."
5,King at his peak,"Wolves of the Calla as all of King's Gunslinger books go, is a classic western town rescue with a bit of sci-fi and occult to spice it up. King creates a people, and a culture deep enough to swim in. The people of King's 'Calla' become real and their religion, language, and rituals are as alive as a garden. King does not stop scaring you either, as always their is enough of the dark side in this book to make you glad that Roland is ever faithfully by your side."
3,Takes a long time to get where it's going.,"In my opinion, (though decent) This is probably the worst book in the series. The whole novel is one huge build up to the battle with the mechanical wolves at the end. I felt as though wolves of the calla tryed in every way possible to side step the outcome of itself for as long as it possibly could til it got there, and god knows it took long enough. It's a good thing it's a central piece of a great and grand story because otherwise i don't see it making it on it's own merit. Calla lives for the ending, and nothing more."
2,He forgot to be objective...,"This book would have been great if it was the length of the original gunslinger. it was a long, long book that seemed even longer than it was. it was actually much shorter than his last book, however the flashbacks were quite useless and added nothing to the story.lets make everyone happy and cut the whole summary chunk in the middle of the book down to about 30-40 pages, keep the intro, and keep the last 20% of the book. the whole thing could be about 300 pages of top-notch writing. instead, it's a wordy tale that does little to gain your interest.oh, and another thing, he relies on alcoholism far too much as a character flaw. it's pretty ridiculous."
3,I was not moved by it.,"""Wolves of the Calla"" was okay, but I was not really moved by it. In my opinion, it suffered from the same problems as ""Wizard and Glass,"" which were too much backstory and it being too long.While I know that Stephen King can go on for a few more pages than necessary, I really think this story could've been told with a hundred or even two hundred less pages. I don't think the extra pages, or the story as a whole, really contributed to the reader knowing much more about the Dark Tower than we did in ""The Waste Lands,"" which in my opinion is the best book in the series.While I am looking forward to the next book in the series, I hope it's better than this one."
1,nothing happens,"This is the most boring book i have ever read. The only book that comes close to it in sheer boredom is Wizard and the glass, but that was at least redeemed by the part with blaine the mono. nothing happens in this book. nothing. for 700 pages. and the plot is a complete rip-off of the 7 samurai. The Wastelands was one of the best books I have ever read - fast-paced and full of interesting concepts, but this book is just a mess of interminable old west cliches."
1,Yawn,While I love most King...perhaps this series should not have been resuscitated!...its still dead...Steve buddy...uhm...I guess it is time to retire.
1,Scratched disks,Several disks were scratched to the point of missing several chapters. I understand this was a used set but still expect to be able to listen to it all.
2,"no,no,no,no,nooooooooooooo!BIG SPOILER!","i love this series and like the rest of you have been waiting a long time for this book.I cannot express how shocked,saddened and let down I felt at reading the last 2 pages.I mean come on Steve all these years and all this waiting and your gonna put yourself in the story?IT WON'T WORK and it's not toolate to change the last 2 books!"
1,I could only read 257 pages of it before I threw it down,"Oh man. I just finished reading SK's book ""On Writing"" when I saw Dark Tower 5 at the library. If you want to see King break a lot of the rules he sets forth in ""On Writing"" this is the book to read. It was so difficult to get through. Life is too short to spend reading fiction like this. Ugh.But to be fair I haven't read it all. I'm hoping someone has and I might still yet finish it."
1,This sucks,"I have read this series and was bitterly disappionted. It is so disjointed (he wrote it over two decades).anyone who writes themself in as a god like character has real ego problems.He put off writing these series of books for so long because he had no idea of where the story was going.Basically he had a killer opening he thought of when he was 19.""The man in black fled across the desert, the gunslinger followed""that's the only good bit in this series of books.Don't buy it you will be disappointed."
5,Roland and the wolves,"Its nice to finally have the 5th book after such a long wait. The book is packed with excitement, although the actual fight between the ka-tet and the wolves coulda been a little longer in comparison to all the time leading up to it. It is also filled with surprises, including an old character from another story. It's also good that King is going to give us what we deserve as faithful readers (since i was in high school)and give the Dark Tower Series an ending. I only hope the ending is a fitting one for such a complicated and long series."
5,Another worthwhile edition to this epic story,"I recently became a King fan and the Dark Tower series quickly became the books I anticipate reading. Wolves has all the excitement and heart of the rest of the series as well as some wonderful allusions that always intrigue. I also admire King for taking the better part of 40 years to weave this story into nothing less than an epic masterpiece. With the addition of Mia in Wolves, King continues to build upon his characters in a dazzling way. I reccommend these books to everyone but just make sure you have the free time for these some 900 pages because it sucks you in!"
4,not a letdown despite the impossible standards i set,"Ok, so I've been waiting for this fifth book in the tower series for a long time, and yes, probably building it up more than it could accomplish. Though, from the last four, wouldn't you think that perfectly natural, since each was more intrigueing and beautiful than the last? Well, i got the book. I read it in about two days, and believe me im paying for those long nights now. It hasn't lost that fervent gotta-see-what-happens-next element that King certainly has a knack for. And while i was a bit put off by the million and one references to other works of literature and movies, etc, I know I'll be waiting for the next one for too long, probably building it up too high in my head, because this fifth book has again managed to be more intrigueing than the last."
2,"Should have been called ""Nineteenth Nervous Breakdown""","Most of the reviewers are right on. I cannot imagine anyone being able to stomach this unless they read the first four.I feel kind of mad that I'm hooked on this. I wish I would have read this one first. I probably would have avoided the previous four and not gotten hooked. As it stands now, I will have to force myself to finish the journey and read 1,500 more pages of this drivel.The dialect of the Calla people is beyond annoying.The smartass tone that is typical of the one or two other King books I read outside of this series could not be more grating in this effort. It sounds like all four of the ka-tet are Larry from The Stand. Terms such as ""The Chap"" and ""Sug"" REALLY get on my nerves.To boil it down, it feels that King didn't put a lot of heart into this. It has a first draft feel. I may feel different after I finish VII, but right now, I feel used."
3,Prose and Poetry,"The Wolves of the Calla was not written by the same man who wrote the Drawing of the Three. The former writes poetry while the latter wrote prose. I don't want to buy the last books because I don't like the ""new"" King's style of writing, (it doesn't even seem to be in the same genre as his older stuff). I know I will though, I'm a Reader. I've got my fingers crossed for the last couple of installments. This book was forced and over written, but at least it wasn't the Wizard and the Glass."
3,Too wordy and long for the story given,"Having waited anxiously for this book, I was really irritated with the writing all the way through. Not to give anything away, but did that part of the story really take 600 pages??? For all the background, I have to say the creatures were not that inventive compared to other books. I am not going to dive into the next book as quickly."
2,"Long read, little pay-off","I wouldn't be surprised if, in the next installment, Roland actually finds a motorcycle and jumps a shark with it."
3,Good but pales in comparison to the first 4,Wolves of the Calla was the true beginning of the end for the series in not only the fact it was the first of the last three but also it was a major dip in quality. It seems very forced. It is also very short in comparison to the earlier books in the series.
3,A long wait for a slow ride,"Much time was spent waiting for the tale to resume, and I must say I was mostly disappointed with the result. The end of part five was pretty strong, but it took way too long to get going.WIthout giving away the book for those that have not yet had the chance to read it, it seems King put this in as a throwaway book in the series. The story goes off on a side road that I am not sure we needed to follow."
4,A good summer read,"I have been into the Dark Tower books from the start. They have been with me from college thru fatherhood, almost like my own saga. Ka. Any way King had the magic for these books for a long time, did he get bored along the way, sure, I did too sometimes. Wizard and Glass was hard work to read. Most of Kings work is from his own experience's and life. I am sure you all have read Bag of Bones. Somewhere in Boston or New York or maybe even Bangor there is a safety deposit box."
3,Love the Story - Hate the New Book Format,"There're plenty of reviews on this story but I have to wtite and tell you how terrible the ""new"" format from Pocket Books is to me. I just purchased books 5,6,and 7 in the series( which I love) Pocket Books raised the price $2 and made it narrower and taller. It no longer matches the previous books of the series (or much of anything else for that matter-please readjust your shelves) but worse, the new dimensions are unwieldy in the hand when reading. Did the people at Pocket Books not pick up this new format and try to read from it before putting it to market? I'm heading out to the used bookstore to try and find these last three in the standard size and then Amazon will get these three back. $30 for an uncomfortable reading experience? I don't think so."
3,havent read it yet!,"haha, i read King when i was a highschooler,(im 30 now). I enjoyed it then. i feel King writings are geared toward entertainment. and that is what i liked about it then. I sure its an Ok book but for me with all the other forms of visual media there is no way a book is going to do it for me. Also it think the two best books maybe of all SK novels were VOl 2-3 of the dark tower. they work very well. The first one was OK and the fourth novel was lame as lame is. Another thing is that I would appreciate having this novel released directly to a PDF version that I could read on my PDA while at work. I might even pay $20."
2,A shallow piece of work !!,"If you read the prologue and the LAST chapter in this book, you have essentially read the whole plot. What's in between is just materials to fatten up the book, and does NOT contribute AT ALL to the story of the Dark Tower or about the main characters. Having reading this book, you won't have any greater insights into any of the characters.This is a sharp contrast to the previous 4th book, which I very much enjoy except the ending where the characters turns into plastic and the dialogue turns to mush. This 5th book is a continuation of that cheesy, unrealistic set of dialogues that just makes you wonder what really happenned to Stephen King."
4,stephan kings Wolves of the Calla,Being a big Stephan King fan my opinion is biased. A good read and a good addition to the series!
4,Took a long time,"I don't know if it was just me, but I had a hard time about the middle third of the book. I did enjoy it, it was just a hard read."
2,Dark Tower,Loved these books till he couldn't figure out how to end them and then killed off all the great characters. Was the last straw with King and me. Won't read anymore of his.
4,Amazing,"Probably my least favorite of The Gunslinger series, Wolves of the Calla is still stupendous. The only reason I'm giving it four stars is because I was able to see some of the plot points ahead of time."
3,The series demise begins here.,"Compared to the first 4 books in the series, it was while reading Wolves of the Calla that I sensed a change in King's direction. I LOVED the first 4 books. This 5th book not so much. Compared to the previous, the pace was much too slow and it seemed like the story could have done without about 400 pages....yes, 400 pages. I have decided to stop reading the series here based on the multitude of reviews I have read regarding Mr. King inserting himself into the series and overpowering/changing Roland to almost background noise. Roland of Gilead is one of my favorite alltime characters and I will remember him as he is now."
4,Closer To The Tower,"Tha latest chapter in the tale of Roland, has the ka-tet riding into the town of Calla and preparing to fight a battle against a group of mysterious child snatching wolves. The wolves come every twenty years or so, and take one of the many sets of twins that populate the town. When the children return sometime later they are husks of their former selves, or roont as they call them. Much of the lengthy book is buildup to the eventual confrontation, but there are also character events large enough to propel the story into an entirely new direction that will obvious be what the next installment is about.If you've read and enjoyed the four books previous to this you won't be disappointed."
4,All right( insert punctuation ),"Beats book IV by a long shot. Lots of connection, believable characters, suspense, humor to relieve, all the things i could want in a King book."
1,Yet Another Miserable Failure in this Drowning Series,"Why do I get the feeling that you people will give a positive review to anything that King writes, no matter how painful it is to read.One reviewer hit it right on the head and, what a surprise(!), his review wasn't helpful to any of you. The sassy, street-wise Susannah is a joke of a character. I can say the same for the whiney, exceedingly tedious Eddie. Even Roland is starting to act like these two, with the corny one-liners over and over again.The language used here by the group and the people of Calla Bryn Sturgis is borderline verbicide. Couldn't King think of a dialect a little less annoying?What happened to the morbid, lonesome GUNSLINGER in the first part of the series? These people are supposed to be killers, not a party posse, for crying out loud.People, stop being clones and give this book an honest review. It stinks, almost as bad as ""Wizard and Glass"", and you know it."
1,Just Aweful,"I anxiously awaited the 5th installment. I should have waited for the paperback - this way I would not have felt as if I threw away $30. I loved the first 4 installments and hope that 'Wolves is nothing more than a momentary transgression. Simply put, it is the most boring book I have ever read. This is the first review I have ever placed on Amazon. I am doing this because I feel compelled to warn people. Let's hope Mr. King didn't ""go through the motions"" for the final installments."
2,Wolves of the Calla is boring big-big,"I've been a fan of the dark tower series since the early 90s, and I've liked them quite a bit. I cry ye pardon King, but Wolves of the Calla blew serious chunks. The beginning prologue is great (and has been available from Stephen King's website for over a year), and the ending is ""interesting"" (with interesting revelations made about the true nature of the ""wolves"") but the 600 pages in between are, simply put, really BORING!!! This is probably King's worst and most boring novel since the Regulators or the Dark Half. Unfortunately, in order to finish the series (with Song of Susannah and the Dark Tower, due in 2004), you must persevere and methodically blow through this most painful of DT volumes."
3,Perfect Continuation,Stephen King has written a great continuation to his masterfull series. If you have read other King books besides the dark tower then you will like this book. King has written numerous books relating to the Dark Tower series such as Hearts in Atlantis and Salems Lot. Both would be good to read before you read this new book. For readers that have read a lot of his books its fun to see the way they refernce each other and tie in together. The storie line of this book is good. Not as good as the first books but still not bad at all. This book is not too exciting until the end and there are a lot of long stories told that sort of make it drag on. If you have read Salems Lot then there is a very long story retold for you but also more of what happend to father callahan. All in all this was a good book and I would refer it to anyone that has read the other Dark Tower Books.
4,Short and Sweet reviewno spoilers,"Wolves of Calla is a good book. Darn good. The story never seems to drag down and I didn't skip over paragraphs that i thought would be boring. If you do skip, you might miss something. Many have talked bad about how it deals with Father Callahan's character but I thought it was rather interesting. I mean I don't kow how many times I have finished a Stephen King book and wondered ( an d maybe made up) my own little stories about what happens to the main characters. Well, in this book we DO learn what happened to the main character form Salem's Lot. Hey I thought it was very good and interesting to see what happened to his life after being ""marked"" by Barlow. Anyways, the story also tells us a lot about the main charcters , Roland, Jake Eddie, and Susannah. They are growing. They are changing. They are getting closer to the tower. This is my @nd favorite of the series, Wastelands being 1st."
4,"Of course it's good , it The Dark Tower","I just got though reading it ,and of course love it ! However I gave it 4 out of 5 simply because there was Waaaay Waaaay and I mean waaaay too much Callahaun and not enough of Roland and his past ! I really hope that the next book has more of Rolands past with his former Ka-tet or that he would write additional books detailing Rolands past , but alas I really enjoyed this book and I hope that if any other charactors from his books make an appearance it's someone more interesting like Jack Sawyer from the Tailsman ! Looking forward to The next !"
5,The Last Gunslinger & His Katet,"I thought this book was very good. A good suspenseful tale Along the Path of the Beam and well worth the wait. If I would've had reason to believe I would have to wait another 10-15 years before the next one, then I guess I would've wanted a story that came across as a little more important, as opposed to feeling like this was just a sidebar (despite all the things we discovered.) But since all the other books are done, it gave me the luxury of being able to enjoy this book on it's own merits without feeling frustrated about the series as a whole. Good Read! The only thing I didn't like was the incredibly, disappointingly BAD illustrations from the legendary Bernie Wrightson. What in the world happened, Bernie?! I agreed with another reviewer who said it was like he never even SAW a black woman before. Yikes!"
2,Steve needs an editor more than ever,"Unlike the original which is tense, short and filled with mystery and the promise of great things to come, ""Wolves"" is long, wandering, and offers little dramatic tension. Though it doesn't really advance the story much I found myself enjoying it anyway beause Roland and MidWorld are cool. The priest is a good characters aswell and there are a few nice bits that are reminisant of Steve's short stories. Definitly don't blow $5o on this, get it from the library."
4,"On one hand, and then on the other...","On the one hand, the tale is a good one, as King is usually a good weaver of tales.On the other hand, somewhere between playing with the downfall of American pop-culture, characters from other novels, and a plot spanning multiple dimensions, he ended up creating a megalith which was just a wee bit too long.Also, a big huge thumbs down to Amazon for posting an editorial review by AudioFile which included a monster spoiler for one of the bigger mysteries in the plot."
3,"90% buildup, 2% action, 8% wind-down.","I'm reading these books mostly on momentum at this point. My coworker says that this one is one of his favorites in the series, but honestly after book three I've been mostly ""meh"" on every single one. This book needed to be about 1/2 the overall length to make the point and tell the story. There just isn't much gained in the rest. It's sort of indulgent. And the constant ""convenient coincidences"" is getting really old and out of hand.It's hard to say ""don't read it"", because you sort of want to know where all this goes... but meh... it's really kinda not worth it."
5,Amazing reading,"I love Stephen King books, I have waited until now to read all of the Dark Tower series because I didn't want to read them out of order or years apart. I am so glad that I did. The were phenomenal, this is definitely some of Stephen King's best writing."
2,This baby took me awhile to read.,"*Possible Spoilers*I was dissapointed with this book. I crave action and this book was 90% mumbo-jumbo. I loved the fourth book and I read that one in about a week. This book took me two and a half months. I hope the next chapter is better.The plot of the wolves attacking Calla Bryn Sturgis was very cool. The whole thing with Mia was BORING. I hope the 6th chapter quickly resolves this issue and moves onto Thunderclap!Can't King imagine something else to write about besides Susannah's stupid schizophrenia?The whole thing with Callahan was also very boring. I found I wasn't very interested in his alcohol addiction.People, I think King is going soft."
2,Not worth the wait!!!!,"This book was not worth the wait, although it is a must read for Dark Tower buffs. I love the Dark Tower Series, however #5 is my least favorite. The book was about 250 pages too long. I found myself getting bored towards the middle of the book. Everything having to do with Callahan's past was interesting, but all of the exciting parts of the storyline were rushed! Potential SPOILER...don't read ahead if you yet to read the book~The battle with the Wolves was also disappointing. It was hyped for a good 300 pages, then the actuall battle consited of about 6 pages. The whole dish throwing thing was a little ridiculous too. Personally I am glad to see Susannah has transformed to MIA and disappeared. I can't stand her. This book would have been better had King expanded on the Calvin Tower storyline (I assume this will be a good portion of 6).After reading Wizard and Glass, I was hoping to hear more about Roland's youth. Hopefully, that will happen in volume 6!!!"
5,Stephen King Dark Tower Series,"tThis book arrived in a timely in excellant condition, and packaged very good. I was pleased with all"
3,As much about wolves as Moby Dick is about a whale.,This book weighs in at 925 pages and the wolves appear on page 879. The story is as much about the wolves as Moby Dick is about a whale. Stephen King draws upon imagery from his own substantial body of work as well as such disparate sources as the Knights of King Arthur's Round Table to westerns like The Magnificent Seven. Readers of previous books in the Dark Tower series will recall how this imagery is powerful but often incongruously juxtaposed. One of the characters from King's much earlier `Salem's Lot' appears in this book and plays a substantial role.
4,Plates of Death,"One of the better books of this series. King gives us a great discription of a small town in Mid-World and how the people have succumbed to an evil force. That force takes the children and makes them roont. Yet the villagers do nothing to keep the kids safe since past efforts were usesless. This story has some great character development and battles, yet some of the themes from previous books in the series continue to pop up as a thorn. Doors to other worlds is reintroduced and is getting old. I am all for connections between all of these books but some of these themes seem to be ways out for an author who is stuck."
3,Container for other stories,"It was a fun read, but mostly it was just a container for other stories to unfold. The last 150 or so pages only dealt with the wolves."
4,What he does best . . .,"King is brilliant at setting up the scene for you, and he's at his best in this book.The plotting between the gunslingers ka-tet, and the Wolves, keeps the pages turning. Much like it did in Book 4, when the young gunslingers were going against the Big Coffin Hunters.The old mysteries of Thunder Clap mountain are replaced with new mysteries like the numbers 19 and 99. That's were King really gets you sometimes, the synchronicities of everything, and how everything is interrelated. But at times you wonder if the author really knows what he is doing, or if he is just hoping it will all come together somehow."
3,Not Much to See on this Part of the Journey,"This book took me over a month to read - not because I'm a slow reader, but the story didn't catch my attention and I found myself often setting the book down to do other things. As a fan of the Dark Tower books, I see the series as a long journey. Wolves is like driving in the Arizona desert, not much to see, but you have to get through it to arrive at your destination.The settings of the story, Calla and New York, didn't spark my imagination like I had hoped in a ""fantasy"" novel. The author didn't either have the time or energy to introduce an intriguing setting in Wolves. I also felt this way with the re-introduction of Susannah's schizophrenia. Old and/or tired territory was being covered in Wolves, including the plot of gunslingers saving a small town.I read Wolves because I'm a fan, but didn't enjoy it as I had the other books. As a passenger on the Dark Tower train, this leg of the journey was of a featureless landscape. ""Are we there yet?"""
2,Wolves Shows King's Narcissim,"I have long been a fan of Stephen King's earlier works but have found his newer stuff leaves something to be desired. A friend talked me into reading this series and I was enjoying the story until ""Wolves of the Calla"". 1st he introduces Walter or Flagg from ""The Stand"" and next he drags in Callahan from ""Salem's Lot"" and goes into a long dull retelling of that tale! The final straw comes when he inserts himself into the story and then Roland et all realize they are only characters in a writers mind!!!! Talk about ruining the flow of the story! Foul play, Stephen!! After this I found it hard to reinsert myself into Roland's world. I now doubt that I will be able to finish the series, which does not live up to the rave reviews."
5,Roland continues onward to the Dark Tower,"I am not going to go into a rendition, I see this has already been done. This is the 5th book in the Dark Tower series and continues to follow Roland and his posse on their quest for the Dark Tower. I enjoyed this book. I thought the way Stephen King innertwined characters and places from his other stories brought depth to the characters and brought more realism to the world surrounding the Dark Tower. I do recommend this book and the series. You will need to read these books in order, I do not believe this book can stand alone as a novel."
3,Gimmick Infringement!!!,"The Rock would say this was gimmick infringement:Doctor Doom with Light Sabers and Snitches....?I used to admire King's originality. This book re-treads alot of old stuff. Not sure I liked that.What is it with authors writing 7-book series like Dark Tower and Harry Potter, having to make each book substantially longer than the last? This book could have been 200 pages shorter."
2,One of the worst King books,"For the first time I actually skipped over long sections of text in a S.King book, because it was so boring. Also, the fact that he weaves himself into the story is really irritating and doesn't help the story line at all. A real disappointment."
3,the naration falls flat on its face,"The previous 4 audio books featured amazing narration that kept me immersed in the story and its characters. In book 5 however, the narrator sounds as if he has had a stroke or has down syndrome. The slurring of his words and lack of ability to emulate the voices from the previous books is so distracting that it takes away from every aspect of the book. I would equate it to watching the miniseries ""band of brothers"" only to find out that a few episodes in they replaced the entire cast with 100 kids from the Special Olympics."
4,Great contradiction of Wizard & Glass,"I was a little thrown off by the 4th installment. I felt as if Blaine had taken the story to a new low. Granted, Eddie had to prove his committment and skill as a gunslinger but I was very turned off the character/immaturity of Blaine. I didn't feel as if he fit into the Path of the Beam well at all. In Calla, we are introduced to many new supporters and objectors to Roland's idea of the Rose and the Tower. With multiple problems that will be resolved by the power of ka, I am transfixed on the way all of them will fit together. The ka-tet & an-tet is being challenged and thus far, we are getting to know much more intimate details of each New Yorker especially, and their desire for the Tower. It's great."
4,"Dark, gritty fantasy marred by post-modern cheese","What originally appealed to me about the Dark Tower series was its romantic classicism and mystery. Here was a hero myth like no other, set in an utterly unique and dangerous world that felt tantalizingly like our future, but so far removed in time as to be a font of magic and fantasy. At least that's where we began. We ended by picking up a snitch from Harry Potter, arguing about the relevance of Dr. Doom, and smack bottom when Roland of Gilead reaches into a worm hole and comes up with a copy of 'Salem's Lot by Stephen King. To make matters worse, the illustrations are awful, lacking the Edward Hopper-esque surrealism of those from Drawing of the Three or the graphic power of the pen illustrations in the Stand (or any ability to draw the human body, period... where did they find this guy, anyway?).Both this installment and the Wizard of Oz bookends from #4 belong on the shelf next to Phantom Menace. What a letdown to an incredible series."
3,Condition of book,Book is dog eared but very readabile no torn or missing pages. With tender loving care Wolves of the Calla will survive many readings.
4,The Dark Tower series is the pinnacle of a master storyteller's genre,"The whole series is clever, sad, all too human and very entertaining. The ending is a shock, but in the end, the only way it can possibly end. Although it would have been great to have a ""happy"" ending, but it just wouldn't have been right."
2,the last Steven King book I'll ever read,"I won't rehash everyone's opinions on what's wrong with this book and the way the series has turned with book 5. I'll just say books 1-4 are definitely worth reading, but 5 dragged like nobody's business and I don't like where King is dragging me. From the way the plot is going now, and King's ""old man trapped in the '70s-'80s"" and repeated writing style/themes, I will NOT be finishing the series. I read enough spoiler reviews to get a gist of it, and don't like what's going on. What a waste of a good beginning (books 1-4) of the series. Especially dissapointing after the awesome book 4 (my favorite in the series)."
5,King Thrills again,"I'm not much at this but I do know that Stephen King has thrilled me yet again with this fifth book of Roland and his pals. This is as good as most in the Dark Tower books, better than some not as good as others, but if you want to take Roland to the Dark tower you have go though the Callas no ways around it."
5,"Riffs on Par with ""...And Justice for All""","I heard the song ""When the Chains Are Broken"" on a century media demo CD, and knew I had to get this album.There are 3 songs on this album which are each individually worth the 15 bucks I paid for the whole album.Songs like Dark Millenium's End, When the Chains Are Broken, and Like the Death of a Sorceress are the whole reason I started listening to Black Metal in the first place.The riffs on this album are some of the best you will ever hear in Black Metal in terms of pure guitar playing.They are highly reminiscent of the kind of riffs found on ""Master of Puppets"" or ""...And Justice for All""."
5,another wonderful book,The continuing story of Shayleen and her family and life in Colorado. The story has a old western romance edge to it. A lot of surprises through out the story. Wonderful historial referances in this book. Again Native American people given the honor of truth in these pages. This was a wonderful second book. I laughed and cried all the way through. Another book I could not put down.
5,one of the heavest original sounding bands of the time,this cd made the last one sound bad(climing the walls had some great songs but lack alot)this one is far better and more mature musically.this cd is still one of my favorites to this day but after this they became souls at zero another tranformation much heavier and more powerful and dark (I think the tour with pantera 91 influenced this)but in 4 years they will disappear after 2 cd and an ep as souls at zero but shanon lankin will end up drumming for godsmack after a short stay withugly kid joe?!
4,Influential,"First heard them on headbangers ball featuring the song Spy. The album is consistent with good lyrics and changes. The beginning song hits hard hits beginning with lyrics that set it apart from the normal dark, blacksunday atmosphere. Gentleman death features excellent guitars and a memorable twang. The next also has good atmosphere guitars with long riffs. Surrounded by idiots ends the first side and continues with desert grins which is one of my favorite songs. ""Peace my friend, before its too late"""
4,Old - School,"I bought this cd on recommendation of a co-worker. I listen to agressive metal and hardcore for the most part, so upon listening to this album (made in '91) it struck me as really old - school. It has guitar lead solos in nearly every song, and the way the vocals are sung is reminiscient of early Metallica. There are some humorous songs on the album, a good instrumental and most of the songs have a pretty clear meaning. So if ya dig older sounding metal it wouldn't hurt to check out Wrathchild America '3-D'."
1,"Great book, awful editing...","This is a wonderful classic for many reasons. But, I urge you not to read this edition, because the notes are terrible! There are notes for things that are obvious, and a lack for those things which need them. The worst offense, however, is that one of the notes (which readers are likely to check, as it gives background on a forgotten song sung by one of the main characters) gives away not only the important action of that short chapter, but also gives away the main line of the story. Awful, awful editing..."
1,Horrible formatting for the Kindle edition - Oxford University Press Edition,"This is a review of the Kindle version of the Oxford University Press edition of this book.Far from the Madding CrowdThe book itself is fine. However, the font style and formatting used by the Oxford press is really unattractive, and there is no way to change the font style. You can change the size of the font but not the actual font style itself. It is a very old style and looks like something from the 1800s. I'm sure this was fine for printed books in the 1800s, but it looks horrible on a Kindle 2 screen in the 2000s. Come on Oxford, when you convert your books to an e-reader format, you need to put some thought into how the work will be displayed on e-readers. When given a choice, I always use the Oxford edition of classics, but for this book I switched over to the Penguin edition just because of the way the work is displayed on the Kindle 2 screen. Horrible job Oxford!"
4,"This book is worth reading, a terific love story!","i do think it's a wonderful fiction! in the process of reading this book, i was captivated by the twisted development of the story and also Hardy's mastery language. it gives you a great picture of beautiful scenery in rural England, and there is romance, expections for what happens next. i really enjoy it !"
3,For the Sake of Completeness,"I'm a serious SA fan, and I jumped at the chance to hear more of their covers and rareities. Fair notification for those looking at this album: this isn't precisely the pinnacle of SA's output. A few of the tracks appear elsewhere, and their cover of ""Wind Beneath My Wings"" -- while novel -- doesn't really sound like they brought much fresh to the party. The primary reason to get this disc is for the acoustic version of ""Mary Lou"", one of SA's critical tracks about relationships and a great song in its original form. Some might prefer this version for the improved intelligibility of the lyrics and more introspective cadence. In any case, if you've got to devour all things Sonata, this is not a bad way to go. Otherwise, try snagging all the main albums first, and look at Takatalvi as the first option for EPs."
5,the book is really one that every woman should have.//////,"I have read many of Miriam stoppards books,and i think they are the best written books i have ever read, the only sad part is that I am in India, and we can only buy limited,ones.., I would love to read all the titles."
3,Action Hair Klingon....,This figure could have been great. As with all toy companies AA did a great job on the alien figures [much more so than the human figures]. And the rubber even works on this figure as it does no interfere with the articulation. My only complaint is the fly-away hair. Since AA saw fit not to add any type of stand or peg holes in the bottom of the foot the figures often fall and cannot have that 'action' pose this hair requires [this guy would have looked better without the super model wind tunnel look].
3,Barking Versus Biting?,"To be successful your bark needs to be aligned with your bite. I liked this book, but it flanneled around the key truths. My book is better. Of course I am biased, I am like that. Secret Habits of Successful [...] is the best self-help book for people who are too nice."
2,"Repetitive, corny, and saccharine","Focuses too much on outdated gender issues. As a professional woman nearing 30, I'm not fighting for a piece of the pie run by good old boys who want to keep me down, I'm trying to overcome inclinations to be passive - with women, men, even just with myself - and learn techniques for communicating directly and clearly instead of trying to handle everything all the time or try to make everyone else's life easier at the expense of my own. This book is not helpful to someone like me. It's also very repetitive, and too much loves its own branding, rubbing the reader's nose in what ""Civilized Assertiveness"" means, seemingly as an attempt at product marketing. I just want some straight tools, tips, exercises for making changes, and this book is not that."
5,Bible Truths Unmasked,An outstanding resource than answers a number of questions concerning the bible and Christianity. Just know that Dake is very straight forward and doesn't sugarcoat his answers.
5,tthe best of Perlman,Itzhak Perlman is no doubt a great musician. However very often he is a showman as well. But not on this album. Orchestra & maestro are practically the one. Perlman's violin cries & laughs & tells the story deep & simple at the same time!
5,The First Single Off of One of The Best Albums Of All Time,"I bought this single back in 1996. I was amazed to find Oasis keeps some of their best songs for their B Sides. Throughout the singles of the first two albums the B sides stand out. Some of my favorite Oasis songs are B sides on their singles. This single features Talk Tonight and Acquiesce, two of the best Oasis songs ever. Definately buy these singles, they're worth it!"
3,"Five stars for cat lovers, two for the rest","An excellent book for cat lovers reading it in their warm beds. Unfortunately it has to be added that when Shackleton started the journey on the ice ""he ordered the destruction of useless animals. That included McNeish`s cat, Mrs Chippy, and Sirius, a favourite pup of Macklin`s."" see: Huntford: ""Shackleton"" page 458"
1,Mrs. Chippy was killed when the ice journey began!!!!!!,"I am amazed that this book pretends that Mrs. Chippy actually witnessed any of these events. Mrs. Chippy, along with several dogs, was killed when Shackleton began his journey on the ice. I am glad I read Endurance first, so I was saved from believing such a story, no matter how heartmwarming. It was a cute story, no doubt, but misleading in that in purports to be truer than it really is.I am a cat lover, but, to all of you who think this REALLY happened (as I see from some of the reviews), it did not! Just keep this in mind."
5,Insightful cats-eye view on shipborne life 90 years ago,"This book is NOT precious--cat fanciers will find Alexander's narrative about how an intelligent cat views things to be one of the best, most balanced, and yet non-syrupy writings on this subject to date. Everyone else might actually learn something about the affect cats have on people, in this case some hard bitten explorers in a stressful situation most of us can't imagine.Knowing the overall context of this story (Mrs Chippy was shot at 2:55pm the day after her ""journal"" ends on Shakleton's orders prior to an aborted dog sled attempt to reach land) makes this story haunting, even tragic. But, it also shows how an event now considered triumphant (the crew's return unharmed) is fraught with little tragedies along the way. That is what makes this story haunting and thoughtful."
5,Superb Shakespeare actress,"IMO the best complete audio recording of Antony and Cleopatra is the one with Irene Worth as Cleopatra, originally issued on LP's, now sadly out of print and never transferred to CD's."
2,Cute,"Nice book, but not one I would normally choose to spend my summer reading and especially not comparing it to another book! However, if it were for pleasure, this book does have several charming qualities."

1,This drive might have a motor reliability problem,"I own two such drives. Both failed in less then two years, one completely, the second one still works if mounted ""upside down"" (otherwise the motor cannot start). I think there are some motor reliability problem with this particular drive and it is more common that one can assume from the posts or WEB research (search Google for ""Maxtor Double Beep Problem"").I also own 4 I Western Digital drives with 8MB cache and they all are still alive. Again this might be a coincidence , but please be careful before buying this drive, especially as a replacement."
3,ashamed,"This drive is so silent and quick.The bad side of this drive is how fast it dies,the only way i can use this hard drive anymore is if my computer is always on.If i shut it down for a couple of minutes all my data will disappear,then i have to reformat(quick)to just get windows back up.I've only had it a little over 2 years.Yes,i treated this thing like a king.At first i thought it was the best $70 i have ever spent,now i regret saying that and take it back.I have a 7 year old 2 month WD Caviar 33200 that still lives longer than this 40 GB drive.PS,My dad had like 2 or 3 of theseMaxtor DiamondMax Plus 40 GB 7200 RPM Hard Drives give failureso he went with a better company.Good luck to you people that hasn't had any problems with this drive."
1,This drive might have a motor reliability problem,"I own two such drives. Both failed in less then two years, one completely, the second one still works if mounted ""upside down"" (otherwise the motor cannot start). I think there are some motor reliability problem with this particular drive and it is more common that one can assume from the posts or WEB research. May be similar to IBM's problems, but I may just have a bad luck. I also own 4 I Western Digital drives with 8MB cache and they all are still alive. Again this might be a coincidence , but please be careful before buying this drive, especially as a replacement."
1,Short life,"I ordered it Dec.5th 2001, it was failing by feb 1 2002. However Maxtor is sending me another drive. I will just have to wait and see how it turnes out."
1,Durability in question,There is nothing wrong with the performance of Maxtor drives but their durability is questionable. Of three Maxtor drives none made it off warranty without replacement. They were finally replaced with another brand and each of these drives has more hours on it than the total of the three Maxtor drives with no problems.
5,I don't think I'll ever go back to Western Digital...,"After two *BRAND NEW FROM THE FACTORY* Western Digital hard drives failed on me within a year of buying them, I decided to try a Maxtor instead. My 40gb drive has worked flawlessly since the day I installed it. It works just as fast and quiet as the Western Digital. The included software and ATA100 compatible cables included are a definite plus. Unfortunately the warranty the drive comes with isn't as good as the one Western Digital provides, but if the way things are going is a sign of things to come, I probably won't have to use the warranty anyway."
1,Complete waste of time and money,"Based on the ""good reputation"" of Maxtor hard drives, I bought one of these when my IBM ""Deathstar"" failed. That turned out to be a really bad choice... I thought the IBM's 2 year service life was bad, this ""wonderful"" Maxtor lasted about 6 weeks before having motor problems and it failed completely 2 weeks after that. Since I don't have an extra room in my apartment to store boxes for all of my electronic items, I threw away the original packaging (Maxtor requires this for returning the defective unit), so, I guess I now have a 90 dollar, two-month-old, paper weight. I replaced it with a Seagate Barracuda and, the jury is still out, but at least I won't have to worry about warranty coverage. The warranty on the Seagate drive stipulates that subjecting the drive to more than 350 G's will void the warranty, so, as long as I don't take it apart or throw it in front of a speeding bus, I should be covered. DON'T BUY A MAXTOR!!! Unless you enjoy throwing your money away."
2,Avoid Maxtor,"I have owned several Maxtor drives over the years, and they are definitely the worst of the bunch. They have all been louder and have benchmarked slower than my other drive. These are also the only drives I've ever had die. I've owned many drives from Western Digital, Seagate, Fujitsu, Quantum, and IBM. ALL of them perfectly, including my ancient 80 MB Seagate drives. Out of 5 Maxtor drives, however, only 2 still work. My last Maxtor lasted less than a year. For speed, I recommend a new Seagate or IBM drive. Western Digital and Fujitsu are very quiet and give good performance. Maxtor drives may be cheaper, but they will cost a lot more when you have to replace a dead drive."
1,A huge disappointment.,"Unfortunately, I have to agree with the reviewer who recommended avoiding Maxtor products. I recently purchased a new computer which had a Maxtor hard disk drive, and after less than a month, it quit working. All Maxtor will do is ship me a new drive after I return the old one, expecting me to be able to handle the installing/uninstalling myself, and I'm a complete moron when it comes to computers. It doesn't seem to me that Maxtor offers any customer support whatsoever for those of us who aren't computer geniuses. Did I mention that they also want me to pay for the shipping and handling to replace their defective product? I'll never buy from Maxtor again."
1,Great Product,I had three western digital drive all failed by the third year got a maxtor drive and have no problems
4,"A fine drive, one installation tip","I installed this in addition to the existing 10GB drive on my 3 year old computer. It would not work using my computer's original ribbon cable, but when I used the cable that came with the new drive everything was fine. All and all, I am very happy with it. And now I have 50GB instead of 10, which is great."
4,"good drive, but the max blast software is confusing","I bought this drive since I know maxtor is a great name in storage devices. It's my secondary drive on my computer, my original is a 5400 rpm 20 GB. Although I haven't filled up the first drive, I needed something a with a little faster access time to pull digital videos off my video camera via firewire. This drive does the trick.The only reason I gave it four stars is the Max Blast software for partitioning the drive it a little confusing. This drive is set up as my slave, and when I went to partition it with Max Blast, it labeled it in the software as drive C:. C: is my master drive, so I didn't overwrite it. Not knowing what the outcome would be, I decided to exit out of Max Blast and configure the hard drive with fdisk, so I knew what would happen. If you know how to use fdisk, I suggest you use that."
3,Too Pricey,"I have 7 dogs - occasionally more when I am fostering. All of my dogs have a terrible habit of eating the yard dirt (the deeper and darker the more they like it), the tiny little tree roots and sprouts deep underground, as well as chewing and swallowing the bark mulch (OUCH!) I desperately want to start them on barley, wheatgrass and/or spirulina to see if it alleviates this situation, but having watched these products for months now, this stuff is way too expensive. I'll keep watching and if a great sale presents itself, I will definitely take advantage of it. I've tried all the holistic and vet advice on breaking this habit to no avail. I provide my dogs with fresh veggies, fruit, oats, bran, rice, etc., in every meal. They also get a daily canine vitamin (top of the line) but obviously there is still something missing, otherwise all 7 wouldn't be eating dirt, sticks and tree roots. Hopefully these products will become less expensive soon."
1,not worth the trouble,"There are cheaper and/or better water bottles out there. This one was obviously not going to be convenient to take out and replace in the cage, so we never used it."
5,Perfect upgrade,"Crittertrail cages should come with this water bottle by default. It has 2 balls in it to prevent leaking, but my dwarf hamster can still drink out of it just fine. Cleaning and refilling is easy. If you have a Crittertrail cage,buy this!"
3,Ok but not the best...,"The item was good, I would not recommend for mice though.. The ball is very tough to push for a little mouse, and I found that even though I could push the ball with my little finger no water would come out! I loosened the lid but still no go. Overall it seems like an ok water bottle.... Just not for mice."
1,Horrible Product,"I got this in the mail a couple days ago. It wouldn't let any water out at first so I figured I had to play with it a bit to get it to work. So some water comes out and I put it in Midnight, my dwarf hamster's cage and don't check on the bottle. Tonight I found out that she hasn't been drinking since she got it. I took it out, trid to figure it outm and eventually put it back and got a little bin of water. When I came back into the room with the small dish, she was going crazy trying to get water out of the bottle.This may have worked for some people, but it was absolutely useless and made Mid not have ANY water. Not to mention made me feel like a parent neglecting her child.The only reason I even realized it was because I didn't recall hearing her lapping at the metal ball at the end. If I hadn't have checked, who knows what could have happened.If you were planning on buying this for a non-leak bottle then I suggest just cleaning up extra wet pieces of bedding."
2,Does not work properly,My dwarf hampster cannot get water out of this bottle.. it apears that there is a spring behind the little ball at the end of the tube and it does not let the ball moe back enough for the hampster to get any water out of it.
1,Defective,I purchased one of these and it does not work! Poor hamsters almost died. Pushed my finger against the ball no water came out did it repetedly still no water. Had to squeeze it to make the ball damp. Guess they are right it does not drip but it doesn't allow the hamsters any water either. Put a super shallow bowl with a bit of water for now until I can find a working replacement.
3,"Fast, Fun Victorian Romance","This was an entertaining little romance! I enjoyed it quite a bit. A fun, PG- Victorian romance. Victoria was certainly mature for her age! It was a cute way to pass the time, and while I may not seek out other books by her, I am glad that a friend loaned it to me to read."
3,Not worth it...,"I know that I should have seen this one coming, but I didn't. I liked Princess Diaries but the same problems that I had with those books are the same ones that I had with this one. Victoria is stuck up, snooty, and has a very large nose which she manages to poke into everybody's business. Jacob Carstairs isn't, in actuality, that bad, and while Victoria comes to realize it in the end, it is annoying to listen to her ranting and obsessing about all the little problems she sees.All in all, I didn't really care for this one. I would suggest some of the others in the Avon True Romance series like: Samantha and the Cowboy or Tess and the Highlander."
3,Not The Greatest,"I hate to be a downer, but this book wasn't that good. It's the story of a snooty busybody, Victoria, who comes from India to England to live with cousins. She meets and promptly begins arguing with Jacob Carstairs, who is really a great guy in actuality. There were a few good parts, but overall I found Meg Cabot's writing to be predictable and totally unrealistic. I thought Victoria, the heroine, was selfish and meddling. Maybe it's just me, but I thought this book was definitely not a great one."
4,Bravo!,"Well, i read Nicola and The Visicount, Meg Cabot's other historical book, and i didnt like it all that much. So i didnt really feel like reading this one. However, i saw it at my local library and i picked it out to read. I loved it! It was much better than the pther book and was funny, interesting and had memorable characters. It's more like Meg Cabot's other books than like the Nicola book. It's enjoyable and funny, so i'd reccomend it to all Meg Cabot lovers. Dont overlook this book just because you didnt like the other historical book. This one's actually good. :)"
3,Eh...,"I didn't like this book that much. Victoria was rude and cold, despite the fact that she tries to ""help"" people. I wanted to smack her so many times during this book. Plus, her relationship with Jacob was sooo strange, I had no idea what was going through her mind. If you're looking for a good romance, this probably isn't a good pick."
5,The only avon true book worth reading,"I have read and hated most of the books in this series. I don't know why I even bothered reading most of them, but they looked good. They weren't. This one is the only exception. It was...well, awesome! It does have that everyday romance cliche, but, it was still a little different. It was very well written, unlike the other avon books. I wasn't expecting much from Meg Cabot after my dissapointment with Nicola and the Viscount, but this book was just really good. I can't explain it. A little funny, a little cliche, a little confusion. Perfect!"
4,Victoria and the Rogue,"Victoria Arbuthnot is shipped off to England to find a husband but she finds herself engaged to the charming and handsome Hugo Rothschild before she even gets off the boat. Her life seems perfect but she can't get the ship's captain, Jacob Carstairs, out of her head. Sure, Jacob is handsome and rich but he also teases Victoria relentlessly. Jacob also seems to distrust Victoria's new fiancé. So, which of these men is Victoria's true love and which is just a rogue?I don't usually read romance books but since I enjoy teen novels I thought I'd give this one a try. Victoria and the Rogue isn't the most thought provoking book I've ever read but it was a more than adequate fun weekend read. Victoria is a bit judgmental but she means well so she not entirely unlikeable. Jacob was also pretty amusing. The ending vas very predictable but that didn't hinder my enjoyment of the book. I'll probably be reading more books from the Avon True Romance series."
4,A WELL READ ROGUISH ROMANCE,"British actress Serena Gordon becomes the voice of Victoria, she's perfect. Gordon is appropriately regal and reads this romance for teens and tweens with relish.Lady Victoria Arbutnot is a wealthy sixteen year old who knows her own mind, and thinks she knows everyone else's, too. She's a privileged miss having grown up in India where she's been pampered and given her own way. That comes to an abrupt halt when she's sent off to London to find a husband.Victoria doesn't waste a minute as she's barely aboard ship before she sets her eyes on and her cap for good looking Hugo Rothschild (he's the rogue of the title, although she doesn't know that yet). He doesn't put up too much of a battle and their romance is off to a fine start.Ooops - there's unexpected interference from the captain of the ship, Jacob Carstairs. He's also young and handsome, and a self-appointed guardian of Victoria's heart and future.Listen to find just what that future may hold.- Gail Cooke"
4,Sort of same plot as Nicola and Viscount.... But good,"This boook was great! But one thing I noticed was, if you had previously read Meg Cabot's other Avon Romance ""Nicola and the Viscount"" the plot is sort of the same. Engaged to someone not good, Someone interferes.But other than that, this book was really good. I'm sad that this is the last Avon Romance!! tear, tear.In Victoria and the Rogue, Victoria is engaged to Lord Malfrey. He seems just perfect for her, until the sly, handsome Captain Carstairs begins to hint that he isn't right for Victoria. Of course, this ticks Victoria off greatly.Then she realizes she might have feelings for CAptain Carstairs.... Its a great story,and I recommend it !!!!!!!!"
5,A great likeness,"I loved this movie and this character even though the movie was hailed as a dismal failure. I am not a Trekkie, and I loved it!"
4,Gets the job done!,"Hey, it gets the job done and that's all I can ask for. I tried several ""cheapo"" pedals, and this one was my favorite of them all. While some had better casings (metal instead of plastic), at the end of the day I'm looking for a good sound, not a pretty pedal board. The pedal seems solid enough, it doesn't take up much space, it sounds great, and it has a versatile range of sounds as far as tremolo pedals come.AND, if you are like the typical musician, you are looking for something that's not going to break the bank."
3,Decent tremelo but with little control,It is almost always true that you get what you pay for. This is a neat little package to produce a decent tremelo effect...but once it is connected in the line of your instrument...it leaves behind an annoying echo effect even when shut off. It would be too much for a musician to disconnect the device on the fly so it cannot be used on live applications without that aforementioned echo.
4,very emotional,I enjoyed this program very much. The backgrounds and inter-relationships of the main characters are interesting as well as heartbreaking. The last few episodes have poor subtitles. You'll need your thinking cap on to decipher them.
2,Half Truths,"The first part of this book is a good treatment of the subject mater and is an interesting read. However, in the last part of the book the author succumbs to manipulating the actual facts for selfish motives. This leaves the reader with a false impression of the truth concerning Daskalos, the teachings and the so-called Erevna."
5,I LOVED THIS BOOK!,"I bought this book on a whim, and was half expecting another boring lesbian novel. Was I ever wrong. This book had everything, stories of love, stories of deception, stories of conspiracy, and all in all was a page turner. I highly recommend this book for anyone out there who has suffered from a breakup and needs a little material to read to cheer them up, or to anyone who just wants something to read that they will never wonder when the story is going to end. BUY THIS BOOK! ENJOY :)"
4,Interesting Stylistic choices,"Tulchinsky's fabulous writing style switches seamlessly between two characters and their 1st person perspectives; thereby creating one plot line with two unique perspectives. I truly enjoyed the reality of Nomi's and Henry's lives, although the theories on AIDS and its origins are a bit far fetched. ENJOY!!"
3,fun idea,I'm a fan of toys that have fun sayings. This one is pretty good and I can recommend if you can get it on the cheap.
4,Was sure looking for this - You can now find it here on Amazon,"I have sure been looking for this album. As of today, you can get a double CD of One More Night & his self-titled 1st album right here on Amazon. Look under: ""One More Song/Randy Meisner"". I didn't realize it but the CD has been re-issued a couple of times in recent years. Personally, I only like the 2 hits: Deep Inside My Heart & Hearts on Fire. You can get live(pretty decent) videos of those 2 songs(and more if you want) either off the TUBE, or his own website. Out on Napstr, you can get stuff from a Covers-Band he had for a while, ""The Driving Dynamics"". The songs were early Rock-n-Roll stuff like: Kansas City, Little Queenie, You Send Me, & etc. I, personally didn't like the way they were done at all - but somebody else might think differently,"
3,...and I have some land in West Texas I'd like to sell you,Randy was my favorite Eagle...until I realized I'd have to make one of his boat payments to get one of his albums/cd's. No thanks. I've got the good songs already.
2,I wish I could Say I Like Brecht,"This play was read for a Woman in Drama course I took last Fall in order to introduce the class to Brechtian drama. I wish I could say I enjoy this; however, I find Brecht to be too in your face with his socio-political ideals. If you are a bigger fan of the forth wall convention in drama, then this is not a play for you. He presents some interesting ideas but I never like characters speaking to the audience in a drama - BLECH!"
5,Hoshi finally gets her own figure..yay!,"Though she doesn't get to do much, Ensign Hoshi Sato is my favorite character on the new Enterprise. She was left out of the first series of figures, but here she is finally, albeit encased in a bulky spacesuit.Her facial sculpt is a decent likeness. But, like all these Art Asylum Trek figures so far, it seems to capture the features, but not the expressions, sorta like a ""dud"" photo. Better than 95% of the figures this size, but just close enough to leave you wanting better.The articulation is excellent. She can stand in different positions no problem, and her hands hold the props from this series great. She's held onto T'Pol's communicator through some pretty demanding missions. Her removable air supply pack (not shown in Amazon's photo) fits on perfectly. The helmet detaches from it, again perfectly.I would have preferred Hoshi in her uniform (or maybe in her decontamination outfit ;), but this is such a nicely done toy I can't complain."
5,Outstanding,"I had mixed emotions about L5, but all of those doubts have been laid to rest. Undoubtedly, the most moving song, and best sounding song on the CD is ""We Are Home."" Roger Bennett has outdone himself with this one. Not only did he write it, but as the lead singer on this track, Roger has proved his versatility. This CD is a wonderful addition to my collection and I recommend this CD to everybody"
5,Strong In The Strength,"This is an outstanding group of young men, I have seen them perform, they are genuine Christian men with intregrity. Their voices blend together very well. This first release of theirs is a ""must"" for anyone desiring close harmony and songs that have been written from the heart."
5,WOW! Strong in the Strength!,"If you want you heart to be touch majorly get this cd! The songs are just what every one needs! Scott, and Roger are awesome on this cd! Scott singing lead and Roger piano and vocals is awesome!"
3,Strong in the Strength,"Every Southern Gospel Music lover should have this CD! As the first CD released by this new group, it is TOPS! Roger Bennett & Scott Fowler were veterans with The Cathedrals, and have begun this new group, Legacy 5, that will climb the ladder in Southern Gospel Music. Each song on this CD has a very special message and will bless your soul! You will want to listen to it again and again."
1,"MSN Direct was shutdown on January 1, 2012.","MSN Direct was shut down on January 1, 2012. WMS801 AND WMS802 do NOT wotk completely without mdn direct active."
4,great weather forecaster,"We bought this weather station after having problems with two other stations, the main problem being the outside temperature sensor not working. Since this unit does not have an outside sensor, we did not have any problems with it...Overall we like the forecaster very much. Only wish we could make it more specific to where we live, we get weather warnings for the entire region and that it was wall mounted, takes up counter space in kitchen. Other than we are very happy with the 3 day forecaster through MSN and like the UV, moon phases, sunrise/sunset times, etc."
1,Worthless Now that MSN Direct is Dead!,I read that MSN Direct (the service that provides the data to the weather station) is to be discontinued on 1/1/12. That means you will only have a digital clock and humidity readouts after that date. What a waste of money this instrument has been. Don't waste your dollars on this one!
1,wms801 Weather Station non functional after June 1 2011 beware,"The 801 would get 5 stars and was a very good product however on June 1 2011 MSNDIRECT stopped sending data rendering the unit useless. Oregon Scientific is no longer connected with MSN DIRECT and is no longer listed as a supported product. If you are considering purchasing one don't!!!!!!!!!!!! I have 2 units available that I am considering throwing out. If you know of some useful purpose please leave me a comment. Weather Direct has an excellent product that runs off the internet. Brookstone also has an excellent set of weather devices using Ambient. These are superior, less expensive and more reliable substitutes."
2,Constant warnings,"Really enjoyed this unit when we first bought it. So much so, we bought a second one for the office. Then as time passed, we realized the area covered (near DC) was so large, we constantly get warnings. It seems there's always a coastal flood advisory or some such around here, but not really near me. Similarly, the ""outside"" temp for the region bears little resemblance to our actual location and temp. And it seems to predict rain a lot, and I'm sure it actually does rain - somewhere.The region is just too large, at least around here, for the thing to be of much use. But it is good looking.BTW, don't lose your instructions. They aren't available at the Oregon Scientific web site."
1,no longer supported by a network/does not work,"had to return it and when I called the seller, he was surprised to hear the network had been discontinued in Jan. 2012! Without the network, it's a door stop (to quote another owner, found when I tried to investigate why the device wouldn't work)"
1,Don't buy,"Poor design. Wx readings inaccurate unless the reporting station in your town. VERY Bright blue lights on sides of unit make it unusable for bedroom. Screen hard to read. And to top it off, my unit quit working 4 days after I received it. Sent back. Not a good product."
1,Avoid this Product!,"When the packaging includes information on how to report missing pieces, that should be a clue. How often does a company have to forget a piece or two before someone gets the fact that they have a problem in their packing process?Mine came with ONE battery and no adapter. Batteries are meant as back-up and NOT primary power source and lasted 4 days. The adapter plug is at a 90 degree angle and configured in such a way that not even Radio Shack had an adapter that fits. Two days of checking with various stores - I could not find a single 6 volt adapter which worked.I will NEVER purchase another product from Oregon Scientific."
5,Know your forecast everday with one of these!!! and alerts too!,"I would like to thank you, I was afraid to order this, because I thought it wouldn't work ,it might not be new. BUT I WAS WRONG!!! It was just like you said, new and never opened. I love it. I glad I bought it. And your service was very quick. Thnks. JeanneI would order from you again a five star>>>>>>>"
1,Worthless!,I've just learned about MSN Direct not supporting the weather feeds to this product. It's worthless now. It was pretty cool when it worked now it's an oversized indoor thermometer. You would think Oregon Scientific would be smart enough to figure out how to send another feed from another source.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!,"This was a terrific product but it depended on MSN Direct--Yes, THAT Microsoft as in Bill Gates, Steve Ballmer, drowning in cash, one of the world's most valuable companies--for a signal to operate. The boys at One Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA 98052, decided that there were better ways of separating you from your money and pulled the plug. So you can buy it but it's useless other than telling you the time and temperature inside your home. I bought one for my wife for the kitchen and while it worked it was a five star appliance. Now, it's scrap for the heap. I don't know what culpability Oregon Scientific has in this. At the very least they showed poor judgment selling a product without a long term commitment from their teammate to support their (not cheap) products. But take heart fleecees, Gates has pledged to leave most of his estate to charity. So it's supposedly all good."
1,It won't work past January 2012,I have owned this weather station for several years. From what I read it will stop working in 2012 because Microsoft is pulling the plug on MSN Direct services which is where this weather station gets it's data. I am surprised they are still selling this device considering the drop dead date is 2 months away.Here is the MSN info:[...]
3,Sad and soulful,"I purchased this album because I loved ""On the Long Ride Home"" so very much after hearing it on the radio. I had also heard ""Flaming Red"" and ""One Big Love"" from her, and loved those songs (which are not on this album). Sadly, I found only ""On the Long Ride Home"" and one other song on this album (the opening track) to be of that calibur. Patty Griffin's lyrics are interesting, and her voice is truly beautiful...but this whole album is depressing, and not too many of the songs sound that different from one another. I was disappointed!"
5,"A profound, haunting, acoustic masterpiece.","A shrouded reverie, shimmering up from the stark acoustic ambience of the East Nashville basement where it was recorded--- this album is one of the great works of American music in the past 30 years. .........It's that good..... that pure."
5,She's back....finally!!,"After a five year absence marked by triumph (opening for the Dixie Chicks, wowing Lilith Fair, and having her songs covered by Emmylou Harris and Melissa Ferrick) and disappointment (recording an album her record label opted not to release), Patty Griffin returns! 1000 Kisses showcases Patty's stellar vocals with a cycle of songs that detail love lost, love found and love everywhere in between. The record has the raw power of her first recording, Living With Ghosts, as well as the musical complexity of her second, Flaming Red. Do yourself a favor -- if you love music, buy this record. Today."
5,love this cd!!!!!!!!!!,"i found this cd while looking at the new lucinda williams cd, i decided to take a listen. i had heard of patti griffin before but never listened to her music.....big mistake. i decided to buy this cd instead of the new l. williams one. i love this cd. my fav. songs are rain and tomorrow night. when i played rain for the first time, i had chillbumps all over. this cd makes me want to sit and have a nice glass of wine and i don't even drink wine:). anyway i just ordered children running through, can't wait till it gets here."
3,"Great idea,great songs,poor production","I listened to this CD in [local store] a few times before I bought it.I was really taken by the ambience and the coffeehouse atmosphere the CD has and the great singing.After I got it home and listened to the whole CD,I was really disappointed at the poor production.It is post produced to the hilt,it is overcompressed,very midrangy sounding with little bottom end.Whoever mastered it got caught up in the game of let's see how loud we can make this CD.It is louder than a lot of rock CDs that I have.The trouble with this is when you overcompress a song(which is fine for heayy metal),it takes away from all the natural dynamics which the artist set out to get,it ruins the coffeehouse ambience,would have sounded better unmastered."
3,A Bit of a Yawn,"I really liked PG's first two CDs. Comparatively, this one is a bit boring, however. It is mostly slow-paced music and most songs sound about the same. This was not true even on ""Living with Ghosts"" where the only accompaniment was an acoustic guitar. I saw Patty in concert promoting this disc which was where I formed my final opinion that it's just not as good as the other two. This disc doesn't have anything compelling on it like ""Carry Me"" or ""Every Little Bit."" On the up side, there are no real dud songs but there are no standouts either, in my opinion."
4,Good to hear Patty again,"Having much more in common with her debut (Living With Ghosts) than her ""electric"" 2nd CD (Flaming Red), Patty Griffin's new disc has a directness and simple beauty. Her songs on 1000 Kisses paint pictures of country life (""Making Pies""), the fragility of love (""Rain""), reflections and regrets (""Long Ride Home"") and various other subjects, all done in sepia tones and sung with a kind of tragic sweetness. Her two choices of cover songs, Bruce Springsteen's stark ""Stolen Car"" and the lovely Spanish ballad ""Mil Besos,"" fit in well with the rest. The arrangements and production emphasize Patty's voice and acoustic instruments - mostly acoustic guitar, but also piano, accordion, violins and cello. The result is an intimate and revealing CD that charmed me and had me wanting to hear it again. I do miss the rock 'n' roll of Flaming Red, though, and hope Patty returns to it again soon."
5,Patty's best,"Patty Griffin has always been a great songwriter. The production on her records, however, has never suited the songs - until now. This is the place to start if you've never heard her. It is an album I will recommend to all my friends who love great singer-songwriters."
4,Another Great One,This is another great album from Patty. It's a perfect taste of the Austin music scene. Patty's unique pure voice combined with her thought provoking lyrics make this a perfect rainy day cd.I highly recommend this with Flaming Red.
5,Heartfelt Genuine Music,"I am not one to gush about any decent CD or book that I buy. Having said that, 1000 Kisses may be one of my favorite albums from anyone. The music is beautful and the lyrics are meaningful; and that folks means everything. I like 'Living with Ghosts' as well, but this album brings the same deep meaning with a somewhat more mellow tone and greater variety. I have to disagree with one reviewer on the track 'Chief' - Patty Griffin's music is imbued with a deep sense of social justice and I think that 'Chief' fits well with that sensibility."
5,Couldn't be sweeter,"Once again, Patty has struck out at something totally different and hit a home run. Long time fans will be delighted that Patty has finally recorded ""Nobody's Crying"" - an unreleased favorite."
5,Reply to Carlson,"Just a comment about Mr. Carlson (or Dr. Carlson, if he is a PhD and commodity in the market). Think about how many people you know that suffer of anxiety, depression, insonia, and other psychological problems, or think about the narcissistic people around you. Try to discover how many americans have sleeping problems, high blood pressure, etc. Finally ask yourself why the United States are the world champion of obesity. And then think if you really need more ''quantitative data'' to support Fromm's ideas."
4,New to philosophy,"I read this book last semester in my Philosophy 100 class. I thought it was probably the most influential to me because I seem to share a lot of views with Fromm and he can be easier to read than I thought Nietzche was. Very interesting, if you want to read some philosophy and make sense of it, I would recommend this one."
4,A great criticism though slightly biased,"The social criticism is awesome. Unfortunately, Fromm missed the simple truth that the unalienated condition depends on connectedness with nature and not on its domination."
2,Fantastic--but don't buy this edition,"Lorrie Mallard has had nothing but grief since she moved to Ashton to stay with her aunt. Her new school is very different from the all-girls' private school she attended in Canada, the other children are not friendly to her and the boys tease her unmercifully. One day, to escape their taunts, she climbs over the fence into the yard of ""the witch's house,"" an old octagon-shaped manor house. There she begins to learn the values of patience and empathy through her friendship with Miss Charlotta Ashemeade--and a number of other interesting lessons through the magic of the enchanted house.I loved this book in grade school, and although many of the references are dated (it was originally published in 1967), ""Octagon Magic"" is still a great read. DO NOT buy the Starscape Books edition, however, as it is full of spelling errors. There are several previous editions of this book without the copy-editing mishaps of this one, and I recommend purchasing one of them instead."
5,An Answer to the Cooking Blues,"I have all of Holly Clegg's cookbooks and I think that ""Meals On The Move"" is my all time favorite. I am not the best cook and I never seem to have enough time. Everything I have made out of this book has been great....even my husbund has commented on it! I highly recommend it. If it works for me, it will work for anyone."
4,Holly's New Book,I absolutely love every cookbook that Holly Clegg has come out with and I have every one. This latest book is so informative and with such delicious recipes. I have recommended it to all my family and friends. I was lucky enough to be at the book signing of this latest book this past Saturday in Baton Rouge and I actually have all of my cookbooks by her signed. My advice to everyone is to buy this latest cookbook. You won't be sorry.
4,Resistor substitution box with changed faceplate,"Identical to the Elenco resistor substitution box, but with a changed faceplate. The PCB is identical, so the capacitors are labeled R1, R2, ..., and the pin spacing is more appropriate for a resistor. Some of the capacitors are slightly too tall for the design, and get squished a little bit in assembly. For more details, see reviews of the resistor box, since it's the same product."
1,MUST ASSEMBLE !!!,I didn't expect to assemble this product from scratch. The photo shows it complete and ready to go and I feel thats completely misleading to the consumer. Not sure if I will return it on the simple fact that I feel I was mislead or suck it up and put it together after all I ordered it because I need it!
1,"play it again, sAM ?","If you are looking for a totally different version of the biblical story of moses, you found it. PARENTS....... READ IT FIRST ! MAYBE ANCIENT IS BETTER ?"
2,"Good Information, Poorly Presented","""A Short History of Germany"" has good information but is not well-written. There are many points where I had to the internet and search for the particular topic being presented in the book, just to understand it better. It tends to go all over the place and does not comprehensively or completely explain much of the history. I frequently had to stop and search back to find out who the author was talking about and how he fits in with the history. If this occurred once or twice, I'd chalk it up to it being an oddity. But in fact, it happened too many times for me to count. I liked the information and it did prompt me to read in more depth on certain times and topics, but I could not recommend this as a good book to read."

4,Great Collection of R.E.M. Early Work,"The single disc collection is fine for the casual R.E.M. fan who discovered them after they left I.R.S. The I.R.S. years will always be the fondest time for me. I haven't had much time to listen to both discs but any hardcore R.E.M. fan worth their salt will pick up the Collector's Edition with the accompanying DVD. This is the best collection of their early work and a document to what a great band they were before they blew up. Although, R.E.M. put out good records on Warner Bros.; the quality wasn't as consistent as it was on the I.R.S. label. This collection made me feel real nostalgic."
4,"""Better than no whiskey at all""",I'm not going to even pretend to be a long time fan of these guys. I just thought it might be nice to have a collection of their earlier works to round out my CD collection. I can't tell you how the remastered songs sound vs. the originals because I don't own any of the original music. That's why I bought this. Quirky and strange you can see them beginning to grow as songwriters as disk one winds out. I've always enjoyed hearing their stuff whenever it came up on the radio and I'm glad I can hear it now when I want. Not for everyone but pretty damn good.Worf
5,Classic REM,"These guys through Document and U2 through Joshua Tree were the absolute transcendent gems of 80s-era rock bands. While I'm not particularly fond of either band's work since either of those (mega-breakthrough, and rightly landmark) albums, these bands were the two pillars that anchored the spectrum of what was then alternative rock. Throw in the Police and you've got all the bands that made me want to be in a band in the first place.The band I played with in the 90s used to cover half of the songs on disc one, although the lead singer refused to do Gardening at Night (still one of my favorites) because the lyrics were too indiscernible and obscure. Remember when Stipe was interested more in the sonic possibilities of his voice than the words?I wore out a lot of record needles listening to all of these bands."
4,vintage value,"Slowly replacing my cassette tapes and LPs with digital files. This $5 compilation saved a couple of hours of analog to digital transfer time. The sound quality is good too. Also, it's a fun, boppy collection from back when we were all young."
5,Exquisite stuff,"Haunting, melodic, rocking ... this is a terrific collection of songs from the key creative period of one of the essential '80s bands. If your only knowledge of REM is of their more self-conscious and narcissistic works of the 1990s, here's a reminder why so many of us were knocked out by them in the first place. As good as any Beatles album you can find."
4,Balance of Power...a top notch band!,"I have recently started listening to power/prog metal, but I have been listening to hard rock/metal for a long time. Balance of Power is one of the most appealing bands that I have heard in a long time. Their latest effort, Perfect Balance, is packed with great guitar, drum, and vocal riffs! The band seems to have great chemistry, as far as playing and writing songs. Their lyrics deal with everyday life that bring forth a great positive message, unlike most of the bands within this genre that only sing about dragons and wizards! Lance King's vocals are some of the best I have ever heard, without a doubt! BOP's vocals are the quality of Queensryche's or Europe's, but the music has the crunch of King's X or even Metallica! If you are like me and like hard hitting music with great vocals, this is the band for you!"
1,Why good music disappear...,"Today's HNIA is like a different band, a different Warren, tho I don't ever want it to be the same, but seems like the essence and the pure energy of the band/music has drifted elsewhere... I miss Karen as well. Tho I think the magic of HNIA has gone, but I still can never ever get enough of the first 4 cds... especially Home Is In Your Head."
3,"come back, Warn","Any album Warn Defever puts out as a HNIA album is going to be good. But relative to past HNIA albums, this one is a bit uninspired. I guess I'm not liking the current path HNIA is taking. Not that I don't like change; the change from their early goth sound to the sound of E.S.P. and Ft.Lake was a giant leap forward. I guess it comes down to the simple fact that I liked Karen better than Lovetta as a singer; Lovetta has a beautiful voice, but it's almost as if she's one step away from MTV."
1,"Ye gods, how could he write this?","Holt must be in serious debt. Reading ""Ye Gods"" was equivalent to being forced to watch an emergency crew pull bodies from a wreck. Bad plot (what little there was), bad writing, bad experience all around. I wouldn't recommend this to an enemy."
4,The bee's knees and the cat's pajamas,"If you know what ""Up, Up, Down, Down, Left, Right, Left, Right, B, A, Start"" means, you will probably love this album. The second track ""Dressed Up"" has been stuck in my head all week.Listen to the samples before you buy though, 'cause this may not be your idea of music."
5,Lovely Book,My two- and four-year olds just love this book. They want me to read it over and over again. Sweet and simple text and beautiful illustrations.
4,"Was my fave, until I heard Arthur Grumiaux","Admittedly, this is a great recording and one that I own and love. But alas, it was knocked off the pedastal where I had placed it when I obtained the Philips CD featuring Arthur Grumiaux (Philips 420700). I would encourage lovers of this music to give a listen to Grumiaux. I found his interpretations to have the best rhythmic, melodic and just plain musical sensibilities of any that I've heard. Technique is invisible; it's the music that comes through with transparent clarity, strength and sensitivity. And the Philips transfers are outstanding. Own both Grumiaux and Perlman, et al, if you dare, and throw Pinnock/Standage in for good measure!"
3,Tear-squeezing,"Hey, is this Bach? Perlman and Zuckerman play Bach as if it were some Gypsy music, or worse: a Hollywood movie. The violins are weeping, super-romantic, tear-squeezing. Perlman did the same with Mozart's violin concertos, but there he was a little more moderate, and the performance is fairly convincing. But in Bach??? - I ran away back to Grumiaux.If the rating was only about the solists' interpretation, I would have rated it lower. But the orchestra is alright, and, which is more: Both perlman and Zuckerman have a very good sound."
4,Same exact release available on a 2002 reissue,"This 1990 issue of 1972/1976 recordings is available on a 2002 release for under $10 here at amazon. The 2002 does NOT appear to be a remaster, so the sound is the same.http://www.amazon.com/Bach-Violin-Concertos-Johann-Sebastian/dp/B00005NPIX/ref=sr_1_3?s=music&ie;=UTF8&qid;=1304199150&sr;=1-3"
3,Not the complete sound track,"I really enjoyed the movie and while the sound track is wonderful, it doesn't include the song that compelled me to order the sound track. Disappointingly, I have no idea what it was and don't know how to find out. This is not the first time that a movie offers a sound track but the song that elicits one to purchase it is not included. This is my last attempt at this futile exercise."
5,Excellent Tracks,"This is beautiful music and it added to the joy of seeing the film, music was subtle but effective."
5,This is not really a review,"This is not really a review, even though I did love the movie and the soundtrack they are beautiful ... but their was one song that I also liked in the movie that is not on the soundtrack! The song I am talking about is the English song by the end of the movie where a lady is interpreting dancin to it, can anyone tell me the name of the song and who sings it?"
3,50-50,"The first half of this CD is gorgeous, and reminds me of the movie without overwhelming me. The second half though falls into that weird movie-tone that reminds me of the movie tooooo much. It's certainly worth getting but find it used somewhere; it's not worth the typical $18."
2,Cucurrucu is the best item.,"I bought the album to hear Caetano Velosa sing Cucurrucu Paloma. He is marvellous, but the rest of the ""program music"" is too monotonous to listen to. Still, some nice Portuguese songs amid the selections."
4,"Great show, flawed discs","The episodes of ""Match Game"" included in this compilation are hilariously fantastic, filled with one-liners, jokes, and an unrepeatable rapport between host, panelists, and guests. Several well-known episodes are included, most notably the famous ""school riot"" episode. Unfortunately, some of the discs in the set, especially disc 4, have problems playing. Some episodes and almost all of the special features on disc 4, for example, are not playable at all, disappointingly rendering the original black and white pilot of the 1960s ""Match Game"" unwatchable. Despite the problems, however, the enjoyablity of this show is well worth buying the compilation."
3,Disappointed in selection,"I was saddened to see how few episodes there were from 1974. Having just watched one hilarious show recently on The Game Show Network, which featured Robert Morse and Adrienne Barbeau, I was hoping to find this in the set, but no luck.I also would have liked to see more of the old B&W; shows done NY, in which there were 3 players on two teams, 1 celebrity on each team. In this earlier version the three players had to match one another.Oh well..."
3,Help needed,"I was a contestant on The Match Game in 1979. I matched Charles Nelson Rielly head to head with the answer to ""Sex and (blank)"" of Sex and the Single Girl. Is this episode on this DVD?"
5,great flashbacks on this tv game,I remember this all through the 1970's....This is the game show that broke some bounderies I feel . I enjoy all the stars and gene rayburn.. excellent for pure entertainment and laughter...thumbs up amazon for all your help in helping me find the things I need in a fast and quick transaction.seven30nyc
1,"Match Game DVD-The ""Blank"" is in the bonus features","I just wanted to add my 2 cents worth to the defective DVD discussion. I am now on my second defective copy of the Match Game DVD. Amazon replaced the first defective copy with another defective copy. Perhaps Amazon and BCI should arrange to determine the defective batches and STOP sending them out. I would encourage those of you that secured working copies let us know where you got your copies, since obviously Amazon is not the place to find them at this time. I am sure many of us were excited that the DVD featured a 1962 pilot, which is the most defective part of the DVD. Hey if anyone lives close to Waynesville, Ohio and has a working copy, may I come over and watch it, since I have now been chasing a good copy for a month?"
2,Defective Set,"I bought this DVD set as a Christmnas gift for my sister, who is a huge fan of the show. Unfortunately, she never got a chance to fully enjoy it.We bought and returned this set twice. At least one of the DVD's in both sets was defective. And even when we purchased this item in a retail store, we ran into the same problem.So, avoid purchasing this product. It looks like this is one of those items that has a chronic problem and the company that produces it doesn't even have the decency to make a recall."
5,Way Better Than GSN,"This DVD set is great! It has many of the classic episodes, no credit crunches, and it has the classic ticket plugs and fee plugs. It's way better than GSN."
3,Pretty good but not great.,"Entertaining if you're a Match Game fan but not a broad selection of episodes. The ""best of"" section is all clips from only the episodes that are already included in this set."
3,Great show. Not so great DVD.,I love Match Game. And alot of great episodes are on these DVD's. Too bad the 4th disc doesn't work. I'm going to order another soon so I can watch the 4th disc.
3,What a Trip Back!,"this was purchased with Pepsi Points but it is such a trip back to the mid 70's!! When I was sick from school, unfortunately too often, I used to watch this game show; so this was quite a nice treat.The DVD itself is hard to navigate through as one has to click on the individual episodes to play them. I wish the people who designed it would have included a ""play all"" feature or play the individual years."
3,"LIked it in it's day, but it seems very dated now","I used to be addicted to game shows. This was a favorite. I recently got the DVD for my husband for Christmas since it was a favorite of his too. I like the extras but the show is corny and dated, as I knew it would be, actually, since it is an older show. But my husband enjoyed it, so that's what counts."
3,"Tough to weld, but fits well","The metal is a bit tough to weld with, but it does come with clamps. (if you wanted to go that route)Everything fits well otherwise. If I had to do it again, I would still have purchased this set.The simplest solution is often the most elegant, and you really can't get much more simple than this- so far as crossover exhaust solutions are concerned."
2,"Nice Styling, Poor Sound, Poor Recharging Circuitry","The most expensive and the most disappointing of a long line of cordless phones I've owned and operated in Manhattan, including an analog model from Sony and digital models from AT&T and Panasonic.High marks on looks, but this model has very poor sound quality -- comparable to last-generation walkie-talkies. (I can't count the number of times callers have asked if they'd reached me on my cell phone!) I also found the interface less than intuitive, requiring *three* button clicks to simply redial a number. I should also note that from day one I've experienced extrememly inconsistent recharging cycles.Perhaps rural or suburban dwellers will experience better sound quality, but I counsel city folk to stay away from this unit."
3,Good phone - kills batteries,"I've owned this phone for a couple of years and everything works fine except it recharges batteries at a very high charging current which basically kills batteries in short order. Even using the recommended high charge rate Panasonics, they generally only last a six months before being able to sustain a charge"
2,waste,"I GIVE IT 2 STARS FOR THE MIXING, WHICH IS GOOD. BUT THE SONG SELECTION IS NO STARS. IT SHOULD HAVE HAD I WANNA KNOW WHAT LOVE IS BY WYNNONA JUDD. JUST GO TO ITUNES AND DOWNLOAD NEW MUSIC, BECAUSE NONE OF THESE CD'S HAVE ALL NEW MUSIC."
1,"old music, old dj","i borrowed this cd from a friend. thank god i didn't buy it. the music is old except for a couple of songs. speaking of old, i saw this guy out and looks like he is 45 yrs old! give it up badboy and retire! let real dj's like jonathan peters,johnny vicious and the riddler make cd's you old man!"
5,I love your newest mix,"I love Joe's newest mix, The Best of NYC Vocal Clubhouse! Joe did an excellent job. I am very proud of owning it and playing it at home, my portable cd player, and my car's cd receiver. Joe is truly passionate about the music he mixes and always give it his best effort to satisfy those who enjoy listening to your music."
5,NON-STOP VOCALS YEAH !,"This is one of my favorite dance CDs out right now, I never stopped playing it in my car, Usually, mix compilations end up having two or four songs that are really good ... and the rest oh well..... Vocal Clubhouse is a perfect mix of all my favoritevocal club songs form track 1 to track 20 great CD !!! best for 2004"
1,"""Pretend""","The smarminess of the author started really getting to me about midway through the book. The small town nature of the book and people that make up such a city is such an easy target to tackle as an author. Much Like building a small city out of Legos, it is fun for a few moments if you are really bored. But then after awhile it just seems like it is a waste of time to keep pretending.That is what this book is like, a big exercise, in sheer authorial vanity, it almost made me offended."
5,Very interesting and intriguing,I enjoyed this book very much and would highly recomend it. It has it's odd moments and explicit moments but overall holds your interest and keeps you wondering and thinking until the very end. Congratulations to Mr. Emmons on a great novel.
2,Confusing,"I found the characters difficult to distinguish. There were so many characters that I got confused. Most of them were not distinctive enough to be remembered, so I kept having to go back and see which character I was reading about. Eventually, I gave up and could not finish the book. It was too much effort. The writing was fine, but certainly not captivating."
2,The comedic parts are good.,"This book is pretty funny in the beginning. But as the the story unfolds you get the sense that the author is trying to make the characters in the book ""supremely meaningful"", when if it was just about the humor and interaction between the people that populate the weird hamlet in which this book takes place, you would have a pretty comical book and pretty good, then it just drags."
4,Netherworld,"I have added this movie to my ever growing collection of Out Of Print (oop) Full Moon videos. However, now the DVD has been re-released. I just watched the video yesterday. I must say, this was a very interesting picture. I think I was expecting a little more from it, but was satisfied w/ the twist at the end. very colorful. Never coming out and saying it dealt w/ Voodoo, it did use different ascepts of the religion to convey its self to the audience. A young man inherits his estranged & deceased father New Orleans Plantation. He comes to find black magic at play and his fathers dying wish to be brought back to life. A sleazy bar/brothell, people turned into birds and such are just a few of the many things that make this movie interesting and worth watching."
4,None of those worlds,A movie that brings to the depths of dark imagination.David Schmoeller succeeds in showing us a fresh new idea that show the spectator how possible it is to bring new stuff to the horror genre.A must see for the fans of Charles Band's Full Moon House of terror.
4,actually just a comment on the movie soundtrack,"worth seeing, maybe even purchasing just for the Johnny & Edgar Winters performance of the exquisitely beautiful ""Netherworld Waltz"" music!and a decently creepy film!"
4,Cheesy... but cool,"So, you may have to take this movie with a 5lb. brick of Velveeta, but you know, it's a pretty cool (and hot!) movie.The scenery is lovely, the cinematography excellent, and the music fantastic. It has its flaws, yes - but all in all, it is a visually stunning movie. I saw it years ago (10+) and I can still see certain scenes in my head today.Oscar winner, no... but it's definately worth a look."
4,Under appreciated,Look and listen a little deeper. Better than it initially appears. Could be a cult classic.
1,Worst Movie On Earth!,"We Just Rented This Movie Through Blockbuster, and i must say, its the worst movie ever created! Me And my mom both agreed. it was so so incredibly stupid. it had absolutely no plot or backbone. so do youre self a favor and stay away and i repeat stay away from this crap."
1,This is suppose to be a horror title?,"I can't believe you people gave this movie 4 stars?? i think i actually fell asleep during this movie about twice, what a horrible movie! you see a flying hand in the movie like twice and that's about it. horror fans want to see horror not some boring movies with no plot! doesn't even deserve half a star at that!"
5,Excellent!,"This is an excellent book on Greek cookery. It is filled with tasty recipes that you would find served in any Greek home. Considering some of the cookbooks you see these days that are filled with fancy recipes that no one has time to make, this book is a delight!"
4,A wide variety,"This is an excellent sampling of English madrigals. This presentation, given by an older roster of the Singers, is a nice introduction to the world of the madrigal, and English madrigals in particular."
4,A Delightful Collection of English Madrigal,"With 35 tracts to enjoy you're sure to find a couple of favorites. I gave this CD 4 of 5 stars compared to 5 stars for the King's Singers World Madrigal Tour CD. If you prefer all your songs in English, this will be your 5 star CD. Tract 32 ""Come again"" is my favorite due to the surperb tenor lead and melodic development. Compared to many polyphonic early music styles (1300s-1485), this era (1500-1610) provides many memorable melodies."
1,what is this,not total body purge for sure.bought 2 from one shiper and 2 from another possitively not product shown 4 bottels say so.doent look grape-e-power to me in the picture.
4,Great replica,Captain Jonathan Archer is lookin' good in this action figure. It is well detailed and articulated. I gave this to my grandson who is a StarTrek fan and he loves it.
2,too tall Archer,"I wanted to finish my collection of 6"" Star Trek captain figures, but this captain towers over my other action figures, so the display doesn't work. As far as I can tell, there isn't a short Archer, and I didn't really like that this was labeled as 6"" when it was really 8"" but then I knew it wasn't made by the same company, but you know, hope springs eternal. I really don't know how durable it is because no one plays with it, it's just for me."
2,"A farrago of quotations, linked by a tissue of exposition","In fact, I bought this book on recommendation, thinking that it actually was a book of quotations. The quotes are interesting, mostly, but the heavy use of them as padding ill-commends the author's authority to write on these subjects."
2,"A farrago of quotations, connected by a tissue of exposition","I resubmit my review, to link with my current list.In fact, I bought this book on recommendation, thinking that it actually was a book of quotations. The quotes are interesting, mostly, but the heavy use of them as padding ill-commends Dr. Martin's authority to write on these subjects. Pedantic and unsatisfying."
2,Not durable at all,"I don't expect a children's toy to last for months. However, the moment I opened the packet from mail, I could see wooden chips falling off from some of the letters. Plus, the blocks are not painted, they are just stickers, they come off easily.Luckily, Amazon offers free returns, so I am returning the item."
1,NOT THE BEST BUY OUT THERE...,"I purchased this puzzle for my 4 year old and my 2 year old. The puzzle is great if you don't mind searching for the pieces all the time as they 'set on top' of the puzzle and don't really sit down in thier places. Only about 1/3 of the piece actually fits down into the space. It is very easy to knock off pieces already in their place when working the puzzle. Also, some of the letters have to be turned around to fit properly. For example the letter O, I, H, S, X, and Z. IN ADDITION TO ALL OF THE ABOVE, some of the pitures could have been better thought out. W has a Wagon behind it but it also has a Horse. It is something I would send back if it wasn't so much trouble."
2,Not usual Melissa & Doug quality,"The letters are basically cardboard, not wooden, and they fall off the board very easily. I love the Melissa and Doug chunky puzzles and I would love if they made an alphabet one. This unfortunately is not like the chunky puzzles at all. I would not buy it again."
2,NOT what it seems,"This is very poor quality. It is cheaply constructed, and when it arrived to our home, the base was warped! The pieces have to be shoved into place. Not good for a child trying to match, believing she's done so, and finding herself discouraged that they don't fit; therefore must not actually match... I wouldn't purchase this item again."
2,Pictures don't go with the letters,"This puzzle looks good, however I have several complaints.1) Two of the pictures under the letters DO NOT have items that start with those letters. The Q has a picture of a bird, I am assuming someone thought was a Quetzal bird, however it is NOT. It is a Hoatzin. Also, the W has what someone thought was a wagon under it, however it is an odd sort of chariot(two wheels)/stagecoach cross and not a wagon.2) The quality is lacking. The board is not flat, very warped, and the pieces are very thin."
2,Not as good as it looks,"I wanted a simple alphabet puzzle for my daughter, and I settled on this one based on cost. I have been very disappointed.1) The puzzle is very thin and the letters easily fall out, which is very annoying because it has 26 pieces.2) I would say that the images are poor choices to represent the letters no consideration to phonics was made. It's hard to tell what some of the images even are.3) Some letters are not accurately cutout on my set. In particular, the ""N"" looks like and ""H"" and the ""Z"" looks upside down.I think this puzzle is worth more like $5 instead of $10. I think I would have been satisfied had I only paid that much."
4,Great wooden puzzle!,This is a great wooden puzzle for my students. I teach mentally handicapped adults and some of them are so low functioning that working on puzzles are just a few of the things they can do well.
5,My 18 mth old knows her ABCs!,"My daughter received this puzzle when she was 15 months old. She can put all the pieces in the right place, name all the letters, and name all the pictures underneath the letters. She is 18 months old now and will sit and do it 5 or 6 times in a row. It sure does keep her still and quiet!"
5,Fond Memories,"Spent great time with my son with this toy.Some pieces got lost during the toddler years, and the boy often put the pieced in his mouth causing it to lose its paper coatings. But we had great time together."
5,Handy book for Honda home mechanics,Great book for the home handyman who wants to do the basics on his bike. It doesn't replace the shop manual but does give fairly comprehensive coverage of most tasks attempted by the home mechanic.
4,great book- helps if you already know engines,"1st off, there are NOT a lot of other options, but it's OK as this manual is really pretty thorough. The Nighthawk is my 1st bike, so the Clymer manual is a great walkthrough of the working parts and maintennance routines necessary to keep the bike running smoothly. The electrical diagrams and troubleshooting sections are quite good for even the novice to follow, and of course, the top end diagrams are excellent (very similar to a Haynes auto manual)."
3,Desk Works Well for Small Spaces,"This desk lives up to it's space-saving billing. it is adequately made and works well in our spare bedroom where it can be easily rolled away when we have guests. We received this desk in less than 10 days from the date it was ordered. It takes some time to put together (plan on 3 hours) and we're glad we used the advice of other reviewers and had carpenter's glue on hand since the package their glue is provided in would be very difficult to use. The cabinet drawers are a little flimsy, there is no beadboard as shown in the photo, and we replaced the drawer pulls since they were made of cheesy plastic. Other than that, we're happy with this item."
2,"Nice size, decent price, impossible to configure","I consider myself extremely capable on computers, and have installed many harddrives, yet I find this drive and the included MaxBlast software the most difficult thing I have ever encountered. I had a problem installing Windows 98 and NT numerous times, and found the software extremely hard to work with, since it is required to utilize all 15 gig, or else I would have used FDISK and FORMAT. Anyway, only buy this if you are extremely confident and have the number of your favorite Computer Technician handy."
5,Delectable!,"Interesting selection of Handel arias beautifully performed and recorded. Marriner and the Academy are at their best, and Kathleen Battle's golden voice caresses the music with often ravishing effect. Her interpretations are passionate but tasteful, and her occasional tendency to sound little-girlish is at a minimum. Flawless coloratura!If you've never heard the aria from Samson: ""Will the sun forget to streak?"" [sounds a little strange to modern-day ears, but not in context] YOU MUST HEAR THIS CD! It is the most hauntingly beautiful piece. I only wish Battle and Marriner would record another recital of Handel."
1,"Contains some very outdated, non-proven pop-psychology ideas","While some of the book is good, if not very outdated, the section on physical types determining personality/behavior is from the 1940's, unproven, and considered pop-psychology. Most specialists these days completely recant and discredit the theory. Until I read that section I was wiling to give it a chance, but what other theories/writings in this book are merely opinions not supported by research??? I seriously wish I had read the publish date (originally 1955 then updated in 1981), I would not have bought it. Also all references in the book are from the 1970's or earlier. Time to create a new book based on current findings and real research Gisell, and take this one off the market!If you are looking for discipline best book I've found is 'setting limits' series by Robert MacKenzie"
2,Outdated,This book is severely outdated and contains a lot of nonsense. That fat children are likely to be happy and lazy for instance. Or that some babies can start solids at younger than 3 months.
2,Not so great,"This book is a bit disappointing. It reads like a horoscope and lacks substance, findings from research, stories about actual children and useful advice."
2,wont last more than a week,"I was SO HAPPY when these recorders arrived because they are simply gorgeous!!! However- unless you plan on putting them on display in a glass case- dont bother buying this. the paint chipped off immediately after after the kids began using them. The next day, the recorder came apart into 3 pieces. after the kids dropped the instrument a few times, the wood split in various places and the 3 pieces would not fit securely anymore. a total disappointment."
4,Fantastic !,"Can't help but compare this compilation with Martin Scorceses presents the blues box set. It's a great introduction to the blues and gives you the who's who of that time period. It's difficult to name one standout track as there are so many, but it's safe to say that if you're looking for no nonsense, raw blues, this is the compilation to buy. The sound is great considering most of the numbers are so old. It's usually difficult to find compilations of this great quality, but this one delivers. The only setback(but it is a minor one) would be that the record company have choosen not to include one booklet with all the track and artist information. These are included individually with each disc."
4,Beautifully-illustrated book on unicorns,"The strength of this book lies in the beautiful depictions of unicorns in all their glory. Artist Michael Hague's renderings of these glorious mythical creatures are just wonderful to look at - here, the unicorns are depicted in various scenes, e.g. a pristine winter landscape, surrounded by fae folk in the woods, by the lake, soaring through the night sky accompanied by fairies, and many more fantastical scenes.The illustrations are accompanied by passages taken from famous works, such as Lewis Carroll's ""Through the Looking Glass"", Shakespeare's ""The Tempest"", poems, etc. This is a book that will be treasured and appreciated by fans of these beautiful mythical creatures."
5,Great Track!,"Terminal tracks are required for any model train. These will also ""re-reail"" cars that are slightly off the rails. I hid mine in tunnels. (Using more than one terminal track insures a good electrical feed!) More than one re-railer is also useful!E-Z Track blows away anything I ever had as a kid. N Scale is pretty small 1:160, about half the size of HO so having track that connects easily and stays together is absolutely necessary! This track is great!"
1,Not Happy,"I was sent the wrong product. When i called to inquire, they tried to tell me they sent me the right product. I requested a curved rerailer for HO and they sent me straight for N. they had record of the right product, but it never got in the box. Not sure what happened but to get it by christmas i had to take off work to get the right product."
1,Hire A Tutor,"I agree with the other reviews - this is a poor book. Examples are terse, not well explained, and often don't apply to the exercises you have to do. College Algebra is an intimidating class for nonmajors (perhaps for majors too), and this book does not help. I'd encourage any professor with a choice not to use this book.So what to do if it's required, like it was for me? I'd say buy the book used (lots of low priced options currently), and use the savings to hire a good tutor to help explain what the book doesn't. I did this, and it did help a lot. I really only turned to the book to write the problems down, and ignored the rest, because otherwise I got too frustrated."
1,How to teach algebra to mathematicians...,"This book was not written for students. It was written for those already fluent in algebra. Why this was chosen as the textbook for my college algebra course, I will never know.The explanations are terse, and if the student does not already posess a natural affinity for mathematics, lead to even greater confusion. Vital steps are glossed over as if the author thinks everyone reading the book instantly understands without explanation or example."
5,Possibly the Best tenor aria collection ever.,"If you crave the best in tenor arias, this is your CD. This fabulous CD captures Corelli at his best, doing some of the most well known tenor arias. His Nessun Dorma simply cannot be improved upon. His performances of the role of Andrea Chenier from the opera of that name are considered definitive and his performance of some of the best arias from that opera on this CD (e.g., Come un bel di di maggio, Col pito qui ma vete) feature Corelli at his best. Likewise, his arias from Il Trovatore (Ah si, ben mio, and Di quella pira) are breathtaking and perfect, as is his Mama quel vino from Cavalleria Rusticana. His Vesti la giubba from Palliaci is also stunning. You simply can't go wrong with this CD if you want a collection of some of the greatest tenor arias being performed by the best operatic tenor of the last 50 years at his peak."
4,awe inspiring,"Despite a few minor flaws, Corelli demonstrates that he was in a class by himself. A sound voice from the lowest register to well above high C. Where is his like today? Highly reccomended."
5,Great for Foster Parents,I sent this book to a friend who is a foster parent. She says that she would like to see EVERY new child who enters the system get a copy of this book...and that every foster parent should read it--as well as all case workers. Pretty high praise! Great for older foster children.
2,Not worth the money,"I bought this book (at our therapist's recommendation) hoping to explain to my own children the concept of foster care and then use it to read to any foster child we end up getting. It really has a lot to be desired. If you are a Christian, good luck explaining how a ""star"" can communicate with your child. Nice idea, sad result. I tried to change the story as I read it to my children to a Christian viewpoint, even to a realistic one, with no luck."
2,Just not for us,"We picked this up at a garage sale because it had a Caldecott Medal Award on it (and because it was $.10). Maybe it's just myself, my wife, our three-year-old and my parents, but no one liked this book at all. The beginning part was fun to read, but it went downhill fast. Lines like, ""I'm brining home a turtle and a rabbit and a giant and a little dead mouse - I take it everywheres"" left us a little weirded out, and not in a fun way. Then there is the page of almost nothing but, ""dee dee dee...""The pictures are playful and whimsical, but the text is really lacking of the same creativity.I think that our son summed it up correctly when he asked, ""Was that it?"""
2,Mini-skirts are not appropriate for this era,"I love to watch the Barbie movies with my 4 year old grand-daughter, and usually we both enjoy them very much. But, it was all I could do to keep my mouth shut during this movie. The incongruities were well over her head, and why should I ruin the story for her with reality. But really, girls riding horses with mini-skirts! I know, kittens don't carry swords either, and girl-power is all the p.c. rage but I wish I had rented the film instead of buying it. We will not watch it again."
4,My daughter likes it,"The DVD works fine as expected and was shipped at the expected time, so i am very pleased witht this product."
4,Perfect for little girls,"My 4 year old has seen every Barbie movie. Although some are better than others, they are what they are. This had catchy music, but no singing, and is perfect for little girls (and older curious siblings!)."
5,One of my Grand-Darlings' favorites,"It's nice to see Barbie still thriving and in this case, a spirited heroine. Our little girls love this story as well as the animation and beautiful colors. I think we'll be watching this story for a long time to come."
4,Recommended!,We have all the Barbie movies at our home and rank this among the top ones. It was visually well done and the music was modern. Another A++ (which I think is a Barbie movie first!!) is that one of the girls (Renee) is African American. I think that was a wonderful addition and feel it was about daggone time!
1,A Sad Downturn in the Quality of this Series,"I have most of the other Barbie movies [just for my own guilty pleasure, no kids in my household anymore] and I have to say that this is the weakest of the lot.The Prince is a sad excuse for a masculine protagonist and dragging Barbie so far out of any recognizable female role just destroys all believability in the movie. Have the writers run out of all credible female roles for Barbie to play that they must resort to having her do ""crouching tiger, hidden tiger"" type moves in mini-skirts in what is supposed to be pre-Revolutionary France?Please, give us more on the order of the Twelve Dancing Princesses, Rapunzel, Swan Lake, or the Magic of Pegasus. Oh, and leave the cutesy modern lingo behind -- responding ""sure"" when the Prince asks Corinne to dance isn't hip, it's just stupid."
1,"Am I having deja-vu, because I think I've seen this all before!","Plot: Cranky middle aged person wants to take over a kingdom, Barbie and her friends save the day.EVERY SINGLE BARBIE FILM HAS THE SAME PLOT, AND THEY ALL COPY OTHER STORIES (WITH THE EXCEPTION OF A FEW) MATTEL SHOULD BE MORE ORGINAL. I WOULD RECOMMEND THE BRATZ MOVIES, WHICH ARE ORGINAL, AND HAVE DIFFERENT PLOTS.Waste of money"
4,"Hey, it's a Barbie movie - but both my 4yo boy & my 7yo girl love it!","Catchy songs (including a remake of the EMF song You're Unbelievable), cute lines, some fancy sword play, decent graphics -- what's not to like for the under-10yo set?! It's clean, has some good lessons and morals in it, and has elements that appeal both to girls (it's Barbie!) and boys (sword play, fighting, soldiers, etc) -- so what's not to like for parents?! The music videos at the end are fun to watch as well (could've done without the extra on the Barbie Fashion Show though -- what???). All in all, I'm very pleased with it and would highly recommend it."
4,Another winner for Barbie,"Great new spin on classic tale that my little girls can relate to and enjoy. One even wants to be a musketeer now! She is 6 years old. Girls can do it to, and perseverance are the themes which are both positive. Girls have watched it many times, even wanted the book!"
5,cute!,Purchased for my daughter who loves Barbie DVD's. Would recommend for all little girls who love a good story with happy endings! A great birthday gift for sure!
3,Another good movie from Barbie,"This was a decent movie and I would recomend it, I was not enthusiastic with alot of the cheesy music in the film, I also feel that there was a bit of an underlying feministic message to girls but it did not come on very strong and I do not feel with right parenting that you would have to worry about that message. I do not remember any negative content and overall would say this was a pretty good movie."
4,Ok,It arrived in a timely manor despite the holiday rush. But the DVD title barely works. The movie itself does play all the way through though.
4,Great Album!!,"This album is like a breath of fresh air sweetened by soft slippery sounds of organic sunshiney love. Manitoba is in the same class as Boards of Canada (Music Has The Right to Children) with quiet tripped out beats, dreamy samples, light outer-surface waves of space, and a sound that will keep you warm and smiling. Start Breaking My Heart is a must have album for those electronica loving fans!"
5,Puccini: Arias/ Montserrat Caballe,How anyone can have such control on high note while singing pianissimo is unimaginable. I would definitely recommend this album.
3,"Ok read but nothing new Zec, Crawley and Hotchner are better",This is NOT a bad read for fans by any means. There are loads of up to date features about this bio but I still think Tony Crawley The Films of Sophia and the bios by Donald Zec and A.E. Hotchner are superior. If one wants a great take and loads of unseen pics search out a few of her hardcore fansites onlne.
1,A tragedy!,"This bio is a tragedy. Poor written, no history, just jive, gossips. An insult to Sophia Loren and to all her fans as well.This horrible book, maybe the worst biography ever written, is a bad collage of information, a lack of journalistic bearing.Mr. Harris' personality takes center stage even if the book is about Sophia. Barbed comments abound which instead of shedding light on the book's subject matter, seem to be included to ridicule its subject. Urgh...!!!"
2,fleshy with filmography,If you are looking for an in depth expose of a magnificent film legend - you've come to the wrong place. This book is really spare with the good jive but incredibly detailed in the film jive.
4,Standard Fair,"I must be a rubber necker to the highest degree because I always enjoy these type of books. It has the standard fair, nothing really new on the format. The author does give us a good amount of detail, which he is known for. I would always like more photos, but there is enough to tell the story. If you like this type of book then you will enjoy this one."
2,Disappointing,"I was hoping for something more in-depth/technical. Unfortunately, the descriptions and analyses are about what one would expect to see in a typical weekday newspaper article."
3,In Search of America's Past,Detailed but not what I was expecting for a student taking a SS class. It assists one with thinking beyond. Book arrived in a timely manner.
4,Wanted More,"I enjoyed every bit of this story, but it wanted more. More of an ending. More of a wrap-around of set-up plot elements. More expansion on some very critical scenes.And yet, the book as is remains vividly and fondly in memory a couple weeks after reading it. The writing is lovely, the main character soundly developed (secondary characters are somewhat shadowy at times), with a lot of excellent and smoothly written detail. But... the thrust of the story came in a bit late and without complete set-up. Elements that were set-up and needed resolution were left undone with some characters left hanging.What was extremely good... the wonderful detail of flying from England to Iceland to Greenland. Beautifully done. The book is worth the price for that alone."
4,A New Beginning for Pastors and Congregations,"Kennon Callahan is well known for his previous books and consulting work. This latest book is aimed at helping pastors who are starting out in a new congregation or pastors and congregations who want to renew their relationship. Callahan has a fresh focus for this reader. So many of the church experts today urge pastors to focus on the problems of their new congregations. Callahan insists that the key to an effective ministry is an early focus on relationships. He describes how a new pastor should plan the first three months around key visits to regular worshippers, shut-ins and hospitalized. He also has suggestions for getting quickly involved in the community, scouting out the church's mission field, developing a team of leaders and setting goals. The best thing about Callahan's approach is his gentle and confident attitude and the flexibility of his advice."
5,A Great Guide and an Easy Read,"During a recent pastor's coffee in a state far from my own, I asked for advice as I prepared to move to new churches and a very different situation from my previous pastoral experience. Dr. Jim Carpenter lent me his copy of this book (I have since purchased my own)with a stern warning to return his copy. After reading, I understand why. The book is full of friendly annecdotes all pointing away from the stepping-stone and mega-church model back into the mission-oriented church we all dreamed of at seminary.The narrative style runs through the book, but Callahan doesn't stop with annecdotal information. He makes clear and convincing arguments for doing certain things certain ways - much of the advice goes against the words of wisdom offered me at my last church. The words are well measured and warm in tone.You'll finish the book on a quiet Friday... but you won't be finished with the book and its ideas for many months. Buy it, enjoy it, and try it out!"
4,"""Taking Lottie Home"" A Great Read",This novel was assigned to be read in my English Literature Class at Shepherd University. That is how I came about reading/hearing about this novel. I was pleasently suprised about this novel. I enjoyed the story and the style of writing. I am in the process of reading more novels by Terry Kay. I would recomend this novel to anyone that is looking for a good read.
3,Not up to Kay's potential,"I found the first half of Kay's novel reminiscent of To Dance With the White Dog. Reading that book is what brought me to Taking Lottie Home. But, I was disappointed overall. At about the halfway point, the story seemed to take a left turn into soap opera-land. It was as though written by two different people. ... I thought it a shame the promise of the beginning wasn't kept through to the end."
2,"Cute, but very poor quality","This outfit is very cute, but the pieces to the suit all come separately and are meant to be velcroed on to the suit. The velcro is not strong enough to hold and the velcro for the shoulder pieces are positioned incorrectly, so we were not able to wear them at all. Overall, not quality enough - I would not recommend."
2,Cute but flimsy,"I expected this product to be a little more sturdy. The helmet was made of VERY thin plastic, not the formed thick kind I thought it would be. The shoulder pieces and shield on front are velcro."
4,Looks like the real deal but doesn't feel like it.,Costume feels cheap but I was impressed with how great it looked once on. The helmut that came with it was really flimsy and big so we used one we had from the dollar store which was much sturdier. I think this costume looks better than the ones I've seen at places like Target but it also costs more.
2,Cute but flimsy,"My grandson age 3 squealed when he saw the costume and immediately asked , Where's the sword?"" There was none. The helmet and shoulder pads made of very thin plastic were dented by being caught in the shuffle by the end of the day, but he never came back to play with it, preferring his OLD spiderman costume over everything under the tree. The shirt is nice with elastic sleeves. Supply your own bottoms. All in all a little pricey for the quality."
5,Knight of the Dragon Costume,"This was the most adorable costume I have EVER seen on a toddler boy. Very well made, cute as a button, and very masculine looking. I would rate this costume a 10 on the amazon star scale if I could. Definitely recommend."
4,weird sizing,"Small sizing. Also, it was weird that the outfit was so small but the helmet was huge. It was a cute costume, but there is nothing inside the helmet to keep it on so my son didn't even wear it."
2,Detachable crap,My 2 1/2yr old son loves this costume. but even the first time he wore it the chest plate and shoulder pads were constantly falling off (especially the shoulder pads) And the helmet was flimsy and way to big for my kids head most the time we were helmet free. And the helmet was one of the reasons i bought this one.
4,Great Costume,"When I first got it out of the box it looked a little cheaper than the online picture, but it was so cute on. We got a lot of compliments and it was the only one like that I saw."
4,Costume was a hit - helmet needs work,"My four-year-old loved this costume -- especially the dragon on the chest, the helmet, and the sword (bought separately). And I got to have my knight in shining armor! The costume seemed to run a little small. The helmet was too big and didn't stay on well, I ended up carrying it most of the time while trick-or-treating. But overall, it was a success and got some great pictures!"
4,Partying purely,Lewis is that rare jazz-funk fusion artist who shares earnestly equal parts compositional integrity and mainstream accessibility.
5,A Modern Jazz Treasure,"I must admit I have several Ramsey Lewis projects, but this one has to be my all time favorite. The title track is simply awesome! I'm talking real strings, ""tight"" horns, incredible rhythm. Ramsey's virtuous Piano work is as always in top form! Very nice music arrangements and Synthesizer work by Larry Dunn. A delight for the modern jazz Lover's ears. Many other tunes are stand outs as well - Skippin', Camino El Bueno. This CD is not just a great buy, but a complete buy."
3,Lewis is for love,"Tequila Mockingbird is one of the greatest albums I've ever had the pleasure of enjoying through candle lit dinners. It has the essence of love, without words to distract you from your dinner partner's conversation, or their eyes!"
3,Wack...,"I fell in love with Big Bank from BET's Uncut and was looking for that song for years before I found it on Amazon. I should have just stuck with that one song. To be fair though, I think every CD is wack when I first hear it. I just never gave this a chance to play fully through...yet."
3,Changed my mind,Before Cognito i didnt give underground much attention. In fact i used kazaa and bootleged all my music. This album opened my mind to non commercial music. This was the first Compact Disc i actually traded doller bills for. cant wait to hear more from this guy. i still listen to this disk once in awile.
2,cute cups but leaky,"My daughter loves these cups but one leaks - and really, that's the purpose of a sippy cup not to leak. It may just be a defective valve but I won't buy this brand again."
3,cute prints but leaking,"as in title, I bought this because of my kid likes these prints but it leaks which is not very good for a sippy cup."
3,Okay cup hard to clean,My son LOVES the backyardigans. He loved the cups I didn't The spout was hard to clean. It had a deep yet hard to get to indention were the cup lid meets the sippy part.
2,"Holds lots, not so durable","These cups (in all their forms...Diego, Dora etc) all do the same thing. After a couple of months of use, the seal around the lids start to leak. This makes for wet handbags, sticky kids and annoyed Moms."
5,Brief Description,"Wild diverse mix of music. This album ranges far and wide from down tempo, abstract sound, nu jazz and beyond. From quiet, mellow tracks to beats that would make PRODIGY proud."
4,Great product for a great price.,"I've ordered this product twice. The first time the whole pack of cable was covered in some kind of powder that clung to everything. The second time, the cable was shrink-wrapped in plastic and clean. Other than this, a great quality cable at a great price with free shipping!"
4,Telephone Magic...,"Words cannot express how impressed I am with this phone. My mother order this phone and to my disbelief I was able to hear perfectly clearly without static. We live around trees that are over 100 years old and we do not have proper reception. My mother purchased this phone for her house, we borrowed after i fell in love with the amazing clear reception and the light weight of the cordless phone. We are now order one more for our business line. Also, free shipping we can not say anymore."
2,Skip this phone,"I bought this phone system for my office. What a hassel! It's like talking into a box, poor sound quality for the money. Panasonic and Sony systems are better, I've switched. Also, I had problems with second handset and needed replacement which was easy. The problem was short battery life, needed constant recharging. Features are nice but could be more user friendly instead of having to train people on how to use the extra features."
4,"Good, but pricey","I have two of these phones for 8 months now, and it works pretty well... they're sleek and look nice, but there are a few complaints... #1, it's expensive for what you get, but the fact that you can add phones to places which don't have phone jacks makes them worth it. My main complaint is that it doesn't allow things like ""flashing."" also, my only other complaint is the volume doesn't go up very high but overall, I'm very satisfied. I recommend getting a headset for the phone since it doesn't work with the one shoulder thing."
2,this one's going back...,"This phone is quite different from other cordless phones on the market, but not necessarily in good ways. it's super small, which would seem great until trying to do the hands-free shoulder cradle thing. the design is sleek and there's no antenna sticking out, but ergonomics suffer. the biggest factor in returning this is the sound quality. it has 2.4 ghz but neither i nor my callers could tolerate all of the static. unfortunately i didn't research this enough -- after reading various product reviews, i'm going to send it back and try a sanyo or panasonic."
4,"Expensive, but convenient","I've owned several of these phones for over a year. They are expensive and include features that most people probably won't use. However, the fact that you can use several phones with one base station is very convenient, especially for those places where a phone jack is not readily available (the less cords the better). You can also use any brand of headphone jack with it.Performance. It works quite well as I have walked over to my mailbox which is about 50 yards without any appreciable decay in sound quality. The belt clip included works well. The only shortfall is that it uses spectrum technology, thus, it echoes. It sounds better than older generation spectrum technology. People on the phone have told me that is sounds like it echoes to them as well.If you don't need the convenience of not using a phone jack and you do not like the echoing sounds of some cordless phones, I wouldn't buy it."
1,Not a very good intro to Griffes' music,"I have bought this CD with great anticipation, having heard good performances Griffes' music before.Mr. Lewin, unfortunately, is far from the magic and poetry of this music. Please follow the score: all pianissimos are in Lewin's playing mezzofortes, pedal has nothing to do with color and atmosphere, and phrazing is simply lacking in expression."
1,Piece of Junk!,"I bought the Everio DVD burner along with the Everior camcorder in 4/06. The camcorder is great, but the burner is a piece of junk. I have NEVER been able to use it. Each time I try a disc - including the blank disc that was enclosed by JVC in the package with the burner - I get a message reading ""incompatible disc."" I returned the unit to JVC within my warranty period, and they sent it back saying it was fine. Next time I tried, same thing, only now I was out of the warranty period, and I am stuck. Yes, I should have acted more quickly to begin with - I didn't try using the burner until I'd accumulated enough material on the camcorder to make what I thought would have been a full DVD. Lesson - use all of the equipment you buy as soon as you get it. But even if I had, the cost of continuing to ship the unit back for service was ridiculous, and I had to cut losses. It is crap, and I am out $200."
3,Arrivederci Yamato,"This 2-CD set (stereo) contains music from the film, Saraba Yamato (that's Farewell/Arrivederci Yamato to you English-speaking Earthlings), an alternate-reality film similar to the second TV season of Space Battleship Yamato (the Comet Empire series), but in which most of the heroes disappointingly die.The music is nice, though it has perhaps too many renditions of the Comet Empire theme. Even so, there was not enough music to fill up the two discs entirely, so the second half of the second disc contains some live performances of scores from the first season TV series.This disc set is currently out of print. But I was suprised to see someone asking nearly $1,000 for it used."
5,Worth the Purchase,"Easy to install and adds nice cosmetic touch. No noticable engine sound increase for my Liberty, but can hear the air getting sucked in. It smoothed out the idle, lowered the idle by 200rpm (yes, I had a clean standard filter beforehand), and made an acceleration difference that can be felt. Well worth the purchase."
1,Flaky Company!!!,"I made an order on December 10th for a Christmas present, which was said to arrive on or before December 20th. I did not receive it and sent an email on December 21st. They had somehow misplaced the order and would have it to us, and sent us a ""10%"" off discount on our next purchase with them (which will be never). So time goes by and we never receive our purchase. On January 12th I send them another emailing asking them about it and they had ""no idea what happened to our order and could not send a replacement because they were out of stock!"" so they refunded our money after over a month of bull crap!! Do NOT go through this company.They also say things are in NEW condition, and they are obviously used once received, with scuff marks, scratches, etc."
5,BREATH AND SHRIEKY,"This is a really good disc. Consoli has a really good voice, first of all. It's breathy and powerful. She's able to do that. The songs are basically straight rock with a little punk overtone. There are many slow songs on this. All these songs, break into something else as they go along. The songs are constructed like soft and loud. Like prog-metal. If you've ever listened to Tool, this is what this sounds like in the structure of the song. It is straight rock, soft, loud technique. Her voice goes from breathy to shrieky. She does both really well. Breathy sexy and real screaming shrieky. The singing is in Italian, wich is a very passionate language. I like world music sung in the language of the countryl. World music sung in English never seems to have the impact on me. I mean, why listen to an Italian disc without it sung in Italian. Very interesting listen, I'm glad I bought it."
4,italian girl power,"a great balance between soft nostalgic songs and strong energetic bass chords (they sound very pixies like to me), lovely lyrics and carmen's distinctive voice makes this cd one of my personal favorites , containing some great tracks ""autunno dolciastro"", ""in funzione di nessuna logica, ""puramente casuale"", ""geisha""."
1,"5 stars?, more like minus 1 star","I like her. I have seen and listened to her on Italian tv and downloaded a couple of her songs. I bought this cd based on reviews here. This is one of the most unmusical unpleasant cds I have ever listened to. I have tried a number of times thinking maybe my impression would change, No way. I am afraid of buying another of her records. 5 stars? I can't believe it. Listen before you buy. This is definitly not on my desert island list."
2,infuriating forced commercials,"The incompetent DVD developers really screwed this one up bad. While the feature is just fine, it contains just one track and NO chapters - this means that you are forced to watch nearly 5 minutes of commercials every time you pop in the DVD. Accidentally hit the back button on the remote? Whoops, now you have to watch them all over again. If I wanted this complete lack of control, I'd keep buying VHS tapes."
2,"It was unbearable for me, but my daughter loved it.","Angelina ballerina is so cute, and she dances, all good, and the voice acting is lovely.I have to warn the parents about the middle story, though, Angelina at the Fair. The main character bullies and then abandons her little cousin Henry because she doesn't want to look after him, and the poor kid is sobbing as he wanders the haunted house, where adults notice but do nothing. She refuses to buy him a blue balloon even after denying him the merry go round because she only has enough money for one thing, and she wants cotton candy (""candyfloss""). Yes, I am aware this is a cartoon, but I was teared up over it and just about sobbing when Angelina says she hates him.My almost 4 year old daughter, however, loves anything with Angelina and didn't notice either the distressing situation or my distress. So this warning is only for the parents: It might upset YOU."
2,not what was expected,"This dvd was of a different type of Angelina and not what my 6 year old grandaughter was wanting or liked. As the 3 dvd's i ordered were also far more expensive than i could have purchased elsewhere, we are not happy to accept what we perceive as being inadequate and wish to return them."
5,"Great product,","I didn't know it was the older show, the newer show is on TV. But it is still good. I only watched it once but I am sure to get many great uses out of it."
5,Very funny book,"I had never heard of this author before, but got the book because it was free. Now I want to read more of his writings! This book was so funny that I actually laughed aloud several times. Really an outstanding book, especially for one that is quite old."
3,it wasnt horrible,I actually started reading this book twice...I had to stop cause at first it was just making absolutely no sense what so ever...but I am a persistant kind of person and I hate leaving things unfinished so I committed myself to actually reading it....it wasnt my favorite book to read and I have no intention of actually going back and re-reading it so I did delete it from my Kindle....with that said the second time I went to read it I really did get into it for awhile but the story just became repetative and I will addmitt somewhat boring at times...and it trully ended kinda suddenly...all in all it wasnt a horrible book but trully was not the best either
2,Quit after 12%,"I am sorry to say I didn't read much of this novel. Specifically I reached location 236 or 12% of the book. The thing that stopped me was the overly gushy romantic relationship that was being described between the protagonists. Prior to that I was not pleased with the fantastic events introduced, although I usually enjoy reading well worked out whimsical prose. I am giving it 2 stars instead of one because I don't think I have given it a fair trial. But there are too many really good things to read on my Kindle for me to go on with this one"
5,A good entertaining read,"I downloaded this book because it was free and have now downloaded all the other free books by this author because I enjoyed ""The Green Mouse"" so much. If only a machine COULD truly be made to ensure your one perfect match could be made for life. The book was entertaining. The language very quaint and old fashioned but easy enough to follow. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to lose themselves for a few hours."
3,A Unique Item,"A very odd item -- an eerie comedy. At least, I think it is trying to be a comedy. Its sociology is extremely dated or was it supposed to be dated when it was written? A very perplexing book, but probably someone's cup of tea. I was just too uncomfortable with its ambiance to finish it, but I wanted to give the right person a heads-up about it. I don't think you will find many like this one."
1,Just My Thouhts,"If you like a VERY MILD mystery, that you can read without losing your place while multi-tasking then this is the book for you. However, if you like meaty mystery you will bore yourself silly. It is worth only slightly more than i paid for it."
5,Karl's neo-psychedelic masterpiece,"Is this album is at the mercy of the seven deadly reviews? I hope not - it's one of my favorites... You might fault it for its many shameless 60's rock references, and its preach-it-brother tone might not be your cup of tea, but the songs are alternately clever and poignant, and evokes a post-punk angry-young-man-grows-up-and-smells-the-flowers vibe that this reviewer finds irresistable."
2,not what expected,These earrings are so small not what I expected. I also don't like the way they latch. Not happy.
3,short cord and noisy,"I bought this pump to replace my tetra whisper 40. The tank is in my bedroom so I'm trying to make it as quiet as possible. This pump, as it turns out, is much louder than the tetra. I like that you can control the output but I found out the more output the louder it gets. I was able to make a cover for the tetra to help buffer the sound. I don't think I could do the same for this it's pretty big. Also the power cord is really really short which is a big problem if you want to place this pump more then 2 feet from the power outlet."
4,this ain't no epitaph,"When you read reviewers talk about this album as if it were some sad farewell by someone riding off into the sunset, you just have to ask, what album were they listening to? If George hadn't passed away, the joy and positive vibes that permeate this album would have had reviewers chiming,""Here comes the sun!"" The beautiful Marwa Blues is the only tune that could be called melancholy, but no more so than My Sweet Lord or Something. No, this is no Requiem; Brainwashed is a Gloria in Excelcis to life."
4,Fifteen Years in the Making...,"George's last album, this selection comes 15 years after his dazzling Cloud 9 offering. While much of the zip that punctuated Harrison's earlier recordings is missing from Brainwashed due to his understandably weaker voice (think 2000's My Sweet Lord remix), this album is still well worth listening to. At times, the sound is pure Traveling Wilbury's, and other times, the introspectiveness of Harrison shines through.I was skeptical about this album going in, because of the involvement of Jeff Lynne. However, I'm happy to say that the typically over-produced album that Lynne is noted for is not as prevalent this time around. Check out this album, I don't think you'll be disappointed!"
4,Brainwashed Revisited,"Except for the title number, this is a masterpiece. Harrison was always the most experimental of the Beatles, and this disc runs the gamut from redone 40s standards to wondrous treatments of his own work. His mastery of many string instruments is highlighted by the fact that most of the tracks on each number are done by George himself. His son has done a wonderful job of editing. If they had just left ""Brainwashed"" off, it would have been perfect."
4,A Pleasant Surprise,"Surprisingly consistant and enjoyable swansong from the quiet Beatle. Easily his most fully realized album since ""All Things Must Pass"". Son Dahni and Jeff Lynne didn't overwhelm the material with post-production bells and whistles. The songs on the album show a remarkable acceptance of fate that only a true believer could understand fully."
5,George is back !!!,"This cd is a nice bookend to George's music library. His voice sounds great and the slide playing is tops.The production is mainly light , with a few exceptions , where strings are added.I would rate this in his top 3 studio albums along with ATMP and Cloud Nine.There are influences of Indian music and lots of bluesy stuff too.I didn't think Beatles when I heard it , just classic Harrison. Dhani and Jeff Lynne did a nice job wrapping it up for George. It is just sad that it will be the last ever , all new cd from George."
4,THANKS OLIVIA AND DHANI !!,"This CD is a MUST for any Beatle fan. With our saddness at the loss of George, this last CD is a special gift, thanks to Olivia and Dhani. It was very kind of them to share George with us one last time. Hearing ""Rockabilly"" and ""Hippie"" George took me right back to my teen years, when George and the Beatles were the ONLY music for me. I feel truly blessed to have one final opportunity to listen to George's messages and songs."
3,3RD BEST,BRAINWASHED IS NOT AS GOOD AS RINGO STARR'S RINGO RAMMA BUT IS BETTER THEN PAUL MCCARTNEY'S DRIVING RAIN
2,I'm sorry this is his last CD,"I'm a Harrison fan. And I can't stand this cd, it's nothing.I prefer to keep playing All Things Must Pass or Dark Horse thank you very much."
2,Hey--The Emporer has No Clothes,"The best thing that can be said about this album is that it will probably be his last. I am a huge Beatles fan, and a huge George fan, but he has not had a really good album since 33 1/3,which was over 25 years ago.Perhaps the only thing worse for George's music than discovering Eastern religion was discovering slide guitar. And Ukulele. And Jeff Lynne. I tried to like this but can't. This album is the personification of all that is the WORST of George Harrison's music. When He sings God God God I'm crying Damn Damn Damn. Comparing this to Traveling Willburys is not necessarily a compliment.But you know, none of the Beatles has released a decent solo album since John Lennon died. Give me All Things Must Pass. Or better yet, compare this dog with Living in the Material World. Just as preachy, but far more entertaining. If you want to hear GOOD George Harrison, buy the three albums I mentioned here."
1,Please Keep Jeff Lynne away from The Beatles !!!!,"I swear anything that Lynne touches becomes Cheese. Why must he mess up this recording, Full moon Fever and Trav. Wil. stuff. Everything sounds the same! And futhermore Harrison never wanted all the production on this. What a fool Lynne is; he is not and never will be a producer and furthmore ELO blows."
3,George Harrison Brainwashed,"A typical George Harrison album. He doesn't make music to make money. He makes music to make music. Although not as memorable as Cloud Nine, ""Rising Sun"" and "" Between the Devil and Deep Blue Sea"" are two songs that stand out. In ""Brainwashed"" the sound of Harrison's haunting guitars are all over the place;even though his son also played some guitars. Considering what was going on through his life at time of these recordings these songs can be very moving. The songs come deep within Harrison. It is as close as you can get to George Harrison without having met him in person. Jeff Lynne and Harrison's son Dhani did a remarkable job of preserving George Harrison's musical essence."
4,takes you back,"listening to brainwashed is like going back to 1970 and listening to all things must pass. harrison displays his ukulele skills on devil & the deep blue sea. if you are a beatles or george harrison fan, or have ever heard of them, this is a must have."
5,HERE COMES THE RISING SUN,"George Harrison's ""Brainwashed,"" is the most beautiful surprise, from a man who has not put out a new album in about 15 years! The slide guitar tears your heart out and George's voice is brilliant and YES, Strong!! (Especially in ""Pisces Fish."")""The Rising Sun,"" is to me one of the most beautiful things to hear! And the words...run deep inside. With tracks that range from the chipper toetapping (good words again)""Any Road,"" to ""Stuck Inside a Cloud,"" and ""Never Get Over You"" (for Olivia)to the driving beat of ""Brainwashed"" itself, This album deservesall the Listening it can get!! And the more you listen the more you hear. So here is to 'open ears' and hearts. The Sun is Shining and ""I say, 'It's All Right, Little Darlin'!"""
3,"4 stars for music; 1 star for price and ""extras""","Fortunately, although the Jeff Lynne touches are there, they are kept more in the background than in his earlier Harrison/Wilbury collaborations. The songwriting is good, and the production is decent. Low praise for a George Harrison CD.Today, the news came out that George left $153 million in his will, mostly to Olivia and Dhani. So, he doesn't need your extra cash. Do the right thing: go buy the CD-only version of Brainwashed. As has been pointed out by other reviews, the extras are nearly nonexistent. What is a ""George Harrison guitar pick,"" anyway? Answer: A guitar pick that they printed George's name on. The poster is tiny, folded eight times over. Don't go to the kitchen, because the DVD will be finished by the time you return.Just play the CD and enjoy the music. It's what George would have wanted, isn't it?"
3,Not up to par with Cloud 9,"Yes, I realize George has passed on and I really want to say nice things about his latest release and him as a person. However, I am writing this review as if it is just another CD from George that needs to get a fair and honest review.That said, this CD is just average. The songs have no real life to them, Gearge vocals are strained and only ""Stuck Inside A Cloud"" has the catchy melody that is lacking in the rest of this CD.Some say they are happy that Jeff Lynn did not ""over produce"" this. I would say he did not do enough to flesh out the songs.I have every Beatles CD, all the solo CDs from each member of the Beatles and Brainwashed is better than a lot of the solo work but does not even touch ""All Things Must Pass"" or even ""Cloud 9"".If you want to complete your collection (as I do), by all means buy this CD. Otherwise, you may be disappointed."
5,Brainwashed special edition - excellent!,"Thank you for adding to my Harrison collection, and the delivery and quality of the product were very good.Regards,Jim"
5,Brilliant!,"This album is brilliant. The poetry is fantastic. The songs are so catchy that they go through your head even without earphones.I always felt that George was the best Beatle. Unassuming, modest and spiritual, not to mention cute.I love the spiritual integration into the words. This is often not well done. I can barely stand most ""religious"" songs. They are trite. It also makes you realize even more that God doesn't care what name he is called by, it is his essence we cry out for. Whether you are Christian, Jewish, Islamic or Buddhist, God doesn't care, as long as you worship His essence. All prayers to God lead to the same one! Who are we kidding? We can separate ourselves, but yet call to the same God."
5,"A sad farewell, but it represents George at his best.",Great album. Seems to deliver morsels of all George's best work throughout. Go to Georgeharrison.com for interesting album info. I can't wait to meet him.
5,As good as it gets!!,"This album makes you remember Harrison at its best. It has the same level of ""All things must pass"". It combines incredible well that era with the ""Cloud 9"" album and the Travelling Wilburys records. It is a must for Beatle / Harrison fans. God bless him."
2,"""Extras"" Are Hardly Worth It","While the music on ""Brainwashed"" is charming (""Stuck Inside a Cloud"" an ""Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea"" are highlights), the ""extras"" you get in this Special Edition are, in my opinion, hardly worth the extra cash. The DVD contains only 1 track -- a 7-minute ""Behind the Scenes"" look at the making of the record that barely says anything at all. The ""poster"" is small and too delicate to do anything with. The guitar pick is cool, though, but I have other guitar picks. Unless I'm missing something, I hardly think the Special Edition is worth the extra hard-earned."
5,Best Beatles Album Ever,"Yes. I have all the Beatles albums and many of the solo albums. This is by far the best among all of them. All tracks in this album are great.The 7 minutes DVD is must for all George Harrison fans.While you are at it, also buy the new edition of All Things Must Pass.Thank you George, you are my hero."
4,Thanks George,"Instead of the 'quiet' Beatle I always thought of George Harrison as the humorous yet thoughtful one. All of his marvelous traits are here on BRAINWASHED. Tongue-in-cheek wit one minute then a serious line that needs to be pondered for a time in order to understand, it's all here on this album. Rather than note any particular song I will just say that the entire thing is a joy to listen to. Working on these songs must have been therapeutic for him and now are ours to savor."
1,KAPOW!!!!,"I haven't heard this CD yet, but after hearing Stuck Inside A Cloud on the radio, I'm beginning to think that people are afraid to pan the new George Harrison album because he passed away a year ago due to cancer. Don't get me wrong, I'm a huge Beatles/Harrison fan. I love most of his Beatles and other solo songs. But this has gone too far. Stuck Inside A Cloud, was a long boring tune. George Harrison was without a doubt a lengendery musician and I was devestated at his passing, but the line's got to be drawn somewhere."
4,All things must pass,"All things must pass, unfortunately, but George in his last bolw, gives us a fine performance, melodic, very consistent, with his Harrison's guitar tune trademark.Farewell George, your music will remain with us forever, everething else will pass."
5,Absolute Perfection!,"This is by far the best album to ever come from George Harrison, which is entirely fitting for his last album. The content is brilliant and the intimacy with which it speaks is beyond description. Thank you George for all you gave to us!"
4,A Fitting Farewell,"It's hard to look at this album objectivly, especially given the circumstances under which we're getting it. Fortunately Brianwashed is a very good album, and something of which George would be proud of.Some of the songs on here can rank among George's best work, the standouts being ""Rising Sun"", ""Stuck Inside A Cloud"", the cover of ""The Devil and the Deep Blue Sea"", and the title track. I know George would hate to hear it, but the album is very Beatlesque in places, there's also a strong Dylan influence on several tracks.My only real grip with the album is that they should have kept the original title Portrait of a Leg-End, that's only a small grip though, and it has to be said that this is a fitting tribute to a musical giant. Cheers George!"
5,George's Last,I got this as a gift in 2002 i did't listen to this all the way through until 2011This is a very good Album! Dhani and Jeff did an amazing job finishing this George would be proud.
5,A fine finale,"This is some of the best music George has done. Yes, there's still some preachyness, but that's George. He is who he is."
4,My Turn!,"Well, I guess it's my turn to write my reaction to George's last album. Love it! Not as good as All Things Must Pass, but stands up well to all of his others. I would have liked more guitar solos. Gems on this album for me include: Any Road, Pisces Fish, Stuck Inside a Cloud, Rocking Chair, and, surprisingly, Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea. Listening to this reminded me that there are only two Beatles left. Let's hold on to all that they have given us musically. Geroge, we will all miss you........... Get the record and listen to it often!"
5,Great finish,"Great for Harrison fans. You can hear the happiness, sadness and sarcasm in George's vocals. At times it seems like he's immitating Dylan. His vocals build on the lyrics, which are among his best, and the melodies are reminiscent of the Wilbury era. The classic Harrison slide is everywhere."
4,A Final Gift from Beatle George,"Its too bad that George took so much time off from making music in the last years of his life. This is such a good group of songs, and Jeff Lynn didn't do his usual over production ELO thing with this CD.Buy this CD, you'll enjoy it. If you ever enjoyed George's music you won't be disappointed with this one. This is better than his last 4 albums combined."
3,A Fine Ending,"George Harrison will be best remembered as the lead guitar picker for the band of bands, the Beatles. ""Brainwashed"" is a testament to his greatness as a songwriter. Upbeat pop nuggets like ""Any Road"" and ""Vatican Blues"" get you out of your chair for a dance. ""Looking for My Life"" plays out like a familiar Stones Lick. I thought Eric Clapton was playing lead on ""Run So Far"" until I checked the album notes. ""Between the Devil and the Blue Sea"" is a 4+ minute ticket to Hawaii. All in all, ""Any Road"" is a fun coda that ends the career of a rock and roll giant. Although it lacks the killer single like ""Got My Mind Set on You"" from his 1987 ""Cloud Nine"" LP, its overall content is as solid as ever. And, ""Brainwashed"" features the best guitar slide work I have heard since the days of Duane Allman."
5,Remembering George,"George Harrison's last recordings on Brainwashed proves that he was a musical superstar. Brainwashed is almost as good as All Things Must Pass. What is life George always talked about, Love one another."
3,"Not the best of him, but still very good","Don't get me wrong! It is a very good album. Nevertheless, I do like better Cloud Nine, even though it is very commercial. His lyrics are very good, but the musical part tends to be somewhat repetitious. His slide playing is all over the place, which is a treat for every one who truly appreciates his playing. I expected more from the CD liner notes, something related to Harrison's departure, last days, and final input on this album. To my dismay, it doesn't have too much information on the liner notes -- besides, I think there are no liner notes. To this moment, I have only listened to it once, so don't assume this review is ""written in stone"". Up to now, my favourites are the first and last song. But this can surely change! George Harrison was a great lyricist, guitarist, composer and singer."
4,great toddler book,"I bought this book for my 20 month old son who has a new baby sister. We read the story, then went back and inserted his name where Sam's was, and his sister's where Sophie's was. The illustrations are charming and tell the story well. Simple language (translated from French) makes this easy for young toddlers to understand, and it covers a lot of the concerns first children have about new siblings--especially when the first child is as young as mine."
1,Not as good as the rest,I love all of the other albums and just figured I love this one too. I was wrong. It was very raw and not what Devendra seems to be on the others. It was one of the first so we'll let it slide.
3,Amazing Devendra,"Though it is nothing compared to Nino Rojo it does have some really great songs. ""A Gentle Soul"" is haunting beyond comparable words. It's like Devendra sang it in a different part of history or something much like his others. For anyone who wants to get into bare bones folk this is definitely a good starting point to venture from."
2,Devendra Banhart,"I bought this for my boyfriend because he loves it so much (he lost his original copy). However, I'm no fan. His review would be far more complimentary than mine."
3,Donnie sees $$$$$ and this record suffers for it.,"This is the one album of the four re-issues that I have to skip over some of the tracks. This album suffers from too many cooks in the kitchen. The Boyce & Hart stuff as well as Mike Nesmith's stuff is great but the rest is just Brill Building dribble, especially ""The Day We Fall In Love"" with its sickening recitation. Apparently Don Kirschner could not hear the music over the ringing cash registers in his head because if he did he would have detected a lack of cohesion, which Boyce & Hart had with most of the first album. Instead he hired other producers and rushed this into the stores without even the band knowing about it. And he had the audacity to write the liner knows praising himself on doing such a fine job.Fortunately there are some good songs here and a great selection of bonus tracks to make up for the dreck. You can also listen to either the mono or stereo versions but for me this is the weakest one out of the four re-issues."
3,A Don Kirshner Production(featuring the monkees),"Granted ""The Monkees""(the debut)was a cookie cutter affair, this is where it goes way too far.There's no denying the high quality of a majority of the songs,but as an album,it seems slapped together very shoddely.Even without knowing the history behind this album,you can still smell the cesspool of the powers-that be."
3,Not worth it,"This is one of the worst albums of Monkees music, only overshadowed in awfulness by ""Changes"". But you have to love a group that can put out a song as bizarre as ""Your Auntie Grizelda"" and still survive. I have to admit, I still like the song even thought it is terrible (it's the only reason I gave this CD/album 3 stars instead of 2). I suppose the same could be said of this album as a whole. But, if you really want some of the songs featured here get one of the greatest hits CDs. Trust me, this one probably isn't worth the money."
3,Great entertainment for 11 year olds.,"I loved this tape when I first got it back in '87. But what 11 year old Monkees fan wouldn't? That's exactly who this album caters to... young kids. Many Monkee fans and even the Monkees themselves have said this is among their least favorites, mostly because of the circumstances under which it was released (the Monkees themselves didn't even know it was released and had to go buy their own copy!) and also because of several of the songs. The worst, as most agree, is the ultra sappy The Day We Fall In Love. Also some true fans don't care for I'm A Believer or (I'm Not Your) Steppin' Stone because of the whole ""Don Kirshner/commercialism"" thing. Although, Don did make them alot of money and put their name in lights. I still like every song on this album, just because I had listened to it so much years ago."
1,NOT Songwriters!,The Monkees did NOT write most of the songs they sing.I'm a Believer and A Little Bit Me A Little Bit You are bothwritten by Neil Diamond (The GREATEST singer/songwriter of alltime!).
3,WHAT DO YOU MEAN THEIR ALBUM?!!!,"Gee why didn't they just throw a picture of Don Kirshner on the front and call it GREED?! Despite the fact that the Monkees had nothing to do with this album, it is still good. My favourites are ""I'm A Believer"",""She"",""Steppin Stone"" and ""Look Out Here Comes Tommorrow"". The songs I don't enjoy are"" Auntie Grizelda"" and ""The Day We fall in Love"". The bonus tracks are impressive including Peter Tork's ""I Don't Think You Know Me"" and ""I'll Spend My Life with you"". Another great soundtrack but be warned it is their most corporate album!"
3,Second Album Blues!,"Imagine you're a Monkee,and you're just informed that your boss has compiled your second album out of a grab bag of material you didn't care for much,without your consent and input.Not only that; you had to buy a copy just to get a listen.Now, wouldn't that irritate you? Don Krishner was trying to get his pound of flesh out of the Monkees,with too many writers and producers vying for position.Although there are some great songs on this album,there is also a lot of sludge.This is a pale copy of the Monkee's debut album;nothing more,nothing less.Thankfully,they fired their greedy boss and went on to make the sublime HEADQUARTERS."
3,Very good tracks far outweigh a few clunkers...,"This -- the Monkees' second official LP -- is similar to their first. It's essentially a compilation of the best tracks from their TV series. So this record contains some great hit songs ('She', 'Mary, Mary') and probably their best song ever -- 'I'm A Believer'. In addition, it contains the Monkees classic '(Look Out) Here Comes Tomorrow', and a pair of nice bonus tracks -- 'Don't Listen To Linda' (a superior, unreleased version), and Peter Tork singing a rare lead vocal on 'I Don't Think You Know Me'. Unfortunately, a few of the songs selected for this record were less than classic -- 'The Day We Fall In Love' is a spoken-word groaner with Davy on lead ""vocal"". Still, the very good far outweighs the bad."
3,"Pretty Good, But the Best Was Yet To Come","This was the last of the Don Kirshner controlled Monkee albums. There are some great moments on it, especially ""I'm a Believer"", which ended up to be their biggest hit, but overall it's a bit uneven. I always thought ""Sometime In the Morning"", written by Carole King and Gerry Goffin, was one of their really beautiful (and most overlooked) songs although they had little to do with it except the great vocal by Mickey. Of all of their albums when Mike was still with the group, he is the most invisible on this album, with only one vocal on ""The Kind of Girl I Could Love"", although he wrote the great ""Mary, Mary"" sung by Mickey. A very pleasant listen, but the best was coming up on the next two albums when they broke free from Don Kirshner to make the great ""Headquarters"" album and the even greater ""Pisces, Aquarius, Capricorn and Jones"" LP."
3,A Don Kirshner Production(featuring the monkees),"Granted ""The Monkees""(the debut)was a cookie cutter affair, this is where it goes way too far.There's no denying the high quality of the majority of songs(I'm A Believer,Stepping Stone,Mary,Mary),but as an album,it seems slapped together very shoddy.Even without knowing the history behind this album,you can still smell the cesspool of the powers-that be."
2,Disappointing at best....,"This book did a good job of explaining the sales office process, but skipped over the really scary things, like buying the lot, lot upgrades, working with contractors, water, sewer, septic, etc...If Mr. Burnsides wanted to be really thorough, he would have given us better statistics, like the Consumer Guide info he refers to, but does not elaborate on nearly enough. A manufacturer list or customer service survey of manufacturers would be nice too. Last but not least, the author's credibility was not helped by all the mis-spellings and errors. Didn't anyone edit this book for him?"
1,buying a manufactured home,I was interested in purchasing a used manufactured home.This book had no information on that.It was all about new homes.
5,A Deluge of Insight,"I opened this book not knowing what to expect. I was soon engrossed in one of the most inspirational and insightful books I've ever read. Many of the book's passages are rather deep but also very beautifully written. The statements in themselves were like mini works of art. I started dog-earing pages that I wanted to be able to refer back to, and quickly noticed I was marking nearly every page. I think this book may be difficult for some to read because it is very profound, but for those whose minds work that way, it will deliver nothing but page after page of exhiliration and awe."
4,Feminism and the Noble Eight-Fold Path,"This book is a 21st century non-stop treatise on the inate attributes women possess and what they can accomplish by becoming more aware. This is not an anti-male book and the warrior image is not one of conquest or destruction. Feldman's woman warrior is focused on improving our society by rallying herself and others to effect the present by having the capacity of ""being"" aware and in the moment. This is essential in a world driven by ""doers"" who neglect the present in favor of a self-serving, tunnel-visioned future. The body of the work is filled with apt examples. Subtly weaving Buddhist priniciples throughout the text serves to anchor the meaning and wisdom of all the book encourages. Ms Feldman's writing is thoughtful, full of energy and insight and will be inspiring to women at whatever stage of life they find themselves."
5,The romance of the Highlands hauntingly captured,"In Queen Victoria's time there was a sentimental craze for all tings Scottish, and Bruch's haunting Scottish Fantasy is the perfect embodiment of it, second only to Sir Walter Scott's novels. But even now, because of the lovely folksongs that Bruch set, this musical evocation of the Highlands can bring a tear. That's what Perlman and Mehta try to do, and I was happy to go along with their sweet, soulful rendition.Heifetz has always been the gold standard in the Scottish Fantasy, but he sounds aloof and steely by comparison. Even Kyung Wha-Chung's notable account on Decca doesn't come close, because Perlman spins a lyric line and silvery tone that pulls the listener in emotionally more than I've ever heard before. EMI's up-close sound is also very appealing."
5,"Macho, passionate, great!","I recognise what the other commenters said about the characteristics of this product, like the balance (weak orchestra compared to violin), and the unsophisticated interpretation.But my opinion is that I love it. I like the straight, raw, passionate style, which also has a lot of dynamic and control. Because the balance between him and the orchastra is in his favor, it sounds like he has the lead, he plays and interacts with the orchestra. I think it serves the recording as a whole. It's got a lot of drama and testosteron to it and it's played with total conviction."
4,Beautiful and Useful,"I use this whistle to call 2 very active English Setters (as pretty as this whistle). It's small so a bit harder to use than a purely functional whistle, but since I was wearing a whistle full time it's much nicer to wear and does the trick.Has a nicer sound than some inexpensive whistles I've bought, just takes practice getting my lips set ""just so"" to get the best sound. Does exactly what is is designed to do.Still wearing, using and enjoying this whistle in 2011. I wear it as jewelry and use it almost every day on walks with the dogs. Lots of complements and lots of good use."
4,GREAT READ,This book had a lot of twist and surprises. I believe the story was well thought out and Ms. Sims is an excellent writer.
5,Making it right for ALL THE RIGHT REASONS,"This was a great story .Showing us how making a mistake, trying to correct it and revealing secrets for ALL THE RIGHT REASONS."
4,A One Time Read,"This was the first novel that I read by Janice Sims. Overall it was enjoyable, however, I felt the love story between Georgie and Clay was lacking. There were so many things going on and so many characters being introduced that it was a bit confusing at times. I felt that Georgie and Clay's relationship was being overshadowed by the reunion of Georgie's mom and dad. I became much more interested in her parents relationship than I did with her own. I also feel that Sims did not spend enough time focusing on Georgie and Clay's romance.Although I have yet to read ""A Second Chance For Love,"" which is a continuation of this novel, I think I will like it better than this one. If you ask me, she could have combined both stories into one book, focusing on Toni and Charles's (Georgie's parents) romance."
4,Not as useful as I hoped,"The portability and ease of folding up are great features, as well as storage of the weights on the rack. I love the bench and the fact that you can slant it back for situps and for tricep dips and a variety of other seated exercies when in the up position. The pulley system is the biggest flaw of this machine - it is not smooth and pretty much useless for weights over 15#. The weights are too big and fall off during the exercise. If you are buying with the pully system in mind - forget it. If you are using the bench- it is still a bargain."
1,No instruction,No assembly instruction is included. Couldn't find it from the internet either. Very frustrating! Found a few other people also didn't receive the instruction.
3,There is room for improvement,"The size of the bench is nice for women. The cable does not work smoothly. When you try to use it it is very jerky. I find the cable completely useless. Like others have written, it came without the instructions. I had to call the company and they emailed them to me. I really wanted something with working cables but too much trouble to take apart and return."
2,No assembly instructions,I also purchased this product and when I received it the box did not include the assembly instructions. Tried calling the company but they were not open. I did however receive the workout DVD.
4,Fun!!,My 10 year old daughter and I have been working through this book during the summer. She has really enjoyed the experiments. Some of the information is a review from what she learned last year in school and some of it is new. Many of the experiments suggested have lead us to new experiments of our own.
2,I feel I've been tricked,"When I got this really small book with no illustratons whatsoever, dull as can be, I could not believe it. Made me think that it's probably not a good choice to shop from the internet."
1,There are better books out there.,"If you're a beginner it might be useful, but you can get the same info written in a way that makes you really 'get' it, in a lot of other books. And you won't have to listen to someone telling you the plots of books you might like to read someday, and music he thinks you should hear - instead of this, try Jack Bickham's work, or Dwight V. Swain."
3,"OK for beginning plot mechanics, but not so great if you need more advanced help","If you're very confused about plot mechanics, you may find this book useful. It goes through the bare elements of how to create a plot and build it to its conclusion. It's nothing new for anyone who's read much about the process of writing (and the advice is not particularly well stated or illustrated), but if you're puzzled as to what plots are supposed to do, you might find it handy. In addition, it offers some ""ready made plot"" ideas, which I guess could be helpful if you had this awesome world and characters and were trying to brainstorm a plot for them."
1,Too general to be usefull,"The discussion presents some interesting ideas and points, but the author uses obscure examples from ancient Greek stories. Why was it so hard to use modern examples from authors who are publishing currently? Who knows. In any event, the insights are very basic and will not result in a substantial knowledge of narrative to lead to a sale."
2,View it as a series of B-sides and it's worth a quick listen,"Yes, I know this is a hated disc but it's not THAT bad really. The production lets it down, sounds like it was recorded in a garage with some of the bass riffs crackling horribly. Not much chance of this getting a digital remastering I think! If you view it as a series of b-sides or previously unreleased material it's ok. NOT worth buying at full price though. Go for a used copy. Chances are it hasn't been used all that much! Ghastly album cover too. Just truly bad. Looks like it was slapped together by a student. It does the album no favours at all."
1,HORRIBLE,This album just sucks - far away from the classic iron maiden albums. only for guys who want to have all of their albums. Dont waste your time
5,Why all this hate?,virtual xi is one of (or maybe the best) album by iron maiden.blaze vocals here are better then ever. and its a real good album!
3,The worst Iron Maiden album,"Yep, this is it right here. Of all 12 studio Maiden albums, this is the worst one. The playing is fine, but where are the songs? This pales in comparison to even the X Factor. At least the X Factor has ""Sign of the Cross."" Virtual XI is just devoid of strong material. ""Futureal"" and ""The Clansmen"" are pretty good, but nothing special. And the rest of the album is not even as good as that. They simply aren't writing good riffs or good hooks anymore. Blah. At least they regained their dignity with Brave New World, their most recent album."
1,yikes....,"this album (and lineup) is a turd. No ones fault really. Just bad writing, bad singing and the total ""doesnt sound like maiden since bruce left"" thing. PS Bruce's writing is a HUGE part of maiden, and he would have the cakes to tell Steve about the obvious parts that sucked. You will know what I am talking about if you listen to this.Still great musicians, entertainers and blokes, but thank GOD Bruce is back. The other dude just wasnt maiden material...Save your money. Actually, download it from a friend, listen to it, and judge yourself. If you like it buy it. but my guess you wont."
1,Horrific.,"Easily the worst album Maiden ever released. Futureal is a good opener but there is nothing good about this album whatsoever. The production is thin, the guitars are synthlike, the instrumentation is basic and passionless, and every song repeats itself more than it should.Blaze's vocals are very lacking and it seems as if every song were written for someone with more range (I.E-Bruce). The album is overall an uninspired parody of Maiden, especially with the redundant choruses that make certain songs more ""epic.""However, if you see a used copy, pick it up for a laugh. Try to count the number of times Blaze sings ""Don't you think..."" and ""Don't Look To"" for a good time."
2,Rock Bottom for Maiden,"Every bands has it's highs and lows. And this was the lowest point of their career. I know because when Maiden came supporting this album, they could only play clubs and bars. That's how bad it got. It's also pretty obvious that at the time, they were more interested in Soccer than making music. I really thought this was the end of the line for Maiden. But thank the maker, they reunited with Bruce and Adrian and set Maiden back to where it belongs. As far as this album goes, there's only one bright spot: The Clansman. Great concert song. For that I'll give it 2 stars."
1,What the hell???,"""Futureal"" and ""The Clansman"" are the only 2 songs worth anything on this dreadful CD, and only when performed live with Bruce Dickinson on vocals. The only debate that should exist is over which album sucks harder... this or X-factor."
2,Just plain average..,"Ok, it's Maiden. It has the epic songs, the strong rhythm, the powerful vocals.But it has no life, bad solos by Janick Gers, bad songcraft by Steve Harris and his pals. So, a change was needed and here they come with Brave New World, in 2000. Smart move."
1,Putrid Slop: I Fart In Your General Direction,"The fact that the members of Iron Maiden had the balls to continue their pathetic career after Bruce Dickinson left was bad enough, but when they continued on even after that, Jesus, what does it take to get these guys to stop from further embarassing themselves, a thermonuclear device? X Factor was crap extraordinaire and Virtual XI is beyond that. I'd rather chew broken glass than have to listen to Blaze Bayley. Steve Harris has lost his mind. Iron Maiden should have been put to sleep long before this. I've coughed up better things than this.Pathetic.Deal with it!"
1,Clansman,"Here's the truth about this album, it is not good. I don't hate Blaze, I stay away from that bandwagon. X-Factor was a pretty enjoyable album, and the music was dark for Maiden, fitting Blazes voice. Blaze, despite being a mediocre singer, sounded pretty good on that album. On here, musically, they tried to regress to their old sound which leaves Blaze's vocals sounding so out of place. At this point in the Iron Maiden career, we are also cursed to songs with 6 minutes of chorus. ""The Angel and the Gambler"" is the most annoying Maiden song ever. Imagine ""Heaven Can Wait"", but make the chorus EVEN longer, and repeat it EVEN more times, and then on top of it make the song bad. Perhaps a light in the dark for my fellow Maiden fans? Clansman is awesome. I hate to be such a downer on such a classic band, but this is how I see it."
3,My Favourite after SSoaSS,"...in fact, this is the only Maiden album I still listen to on a regular basis - it has aged very well for me. I think it is their most cohesive post-Seventh Son output. What stands out are the guitar harmonies, and varied song structures. Whatever your opinion is of Blaze, it can't be denied that he had impeccable timing (like Broadway-good), a fact that the vocal arrangements take advantage of.I've read conflicting opinions of the production - that it sounds overproduced a la Pro-Tools, or that it's underproduced like the Soundhouse Tapes. I think it sounds very live-recorded; listen to the guitarist's fingers scrape the strings during ""Don't Look..."". Many productions would edit that out, but Maiden left it. So definitely not overproduced, IMO.Also noteworthy is that The Clansman has been a concert staple ever since, and that Futureal was part of the Ed-Hunter reunion setlist."
3,differet,"Not Maiden's best, but I still like it. I too find some of the choruses repetitive as well as songs being too long. I hate the last song. I've seen them do a few of the songs off this CD live w/ Bruce on vocals. It seems that when some of these songs were written, they still had a mindset of Bruce still being the singer. Clansmen and few others not only sounded better with Bruce, but almost seemed to be written for him. Anyone else notice this?"
4,not all bad,"When I bought this Cd I didn't have high hopes from what I had heard. Although it wasn't as bad as they make it sound. Basically the reason it failed was cause of Blaze. He is a great singer he just doesn't fit Maiden. If Bruce would have done it it would be alot better. The only real bad songs are The angel and the gambler and como estas amigo. The Clansman it probably on of Maiden's best songs, just listen to the rio version its awesome. The angel and the gambler is just terrible not maiden at all plus its way to repetitive. Como estats amigo just lame looking at the name (don't think I've gotten all the way through it). Not a must buy just for die hard fans."
1,Buy this if you want to be disappointed,"This is loosely based on the life of Nikola Tesla and has some glaring errors for example: AC is ""Alternative Current""the narrative talks about the American/Spanish War around the start of the 20th Century whilst WW2 footage runs (they do the same when the narrative is about WW1). They refer to Tesla's remote control boat as having the ability to respond to voice commands (Tesla himself said he controlled the responses).The clincher for me was that whenever the narrative was on the Colorado Springs site, the footage they repeatedly showed was of the Wardenclyffe building and Tower.The details of Tesla's life were so thin that almost half thevideo is taken up with footage of enthusiasts versions of the Tesla coil. This is accompanied by a narrative that is supposed to instruct you in how to build one, (I had to struggle to keep from falling asleep during this portion).In my opinion you'd be better off with the PBS/Warner videoTesla - Master of Lightning."
1,Esto no es salsa...........................,"La musica de Victor Manuelle es floja y no se puede clasificar como Salsa. En realidad es un sonsonete recyclado en cada disco. Como Boricua e instructor de baile de salsa puedo decir que las personas se frustran tratando de bailar salsa con la musica de Victor Manuelle. Les digo que si quieren escuchar y bailar buena Salsa escogan la musica de la Sonora Poncena, Willie Rosario y El Gran Combo entre otros..........Eso si es musica de verdad y Salsa Boricua..........."
3,Great album overall but the unexpected occurred.,"I put the album in and listened to it, but by the third song I broke an axel. Luckily I could repair it, but it gave out on me while fording the second river. If that wasn't enough, Mary got dysentery. Overall a good album, but with all these misfortunes I am afraid next time I listen my party will end up being named Donner."
2,Three parts good but definitely not his best work,"This book starts off well and gathers wonderful pace in the middle. I thoroughly enjoyed the the first three quarters of the book, but I felt Grisham lost his way towards the end of this story and didn't really know how to finish what he had started. I think the main problem was that it became increasingly difficult to continue to like the main character as the story developed. I guess this is a reflection of the trade he had chosen to ply - does anyone like a tort lawyer? One knew that as the story went by it looked increasingly likely that Clay was going to be hoisted by his own petard, but I was really looking for a story twist that would bring him out on the right side. I felt let down.This is well short of his earlier quality demonstrated most memorably through A Time To Kill. On reflection I suspect he wrote this book in something of a hurry, he probably had an obligation to his publisher. Sorry John, you can do better."
2,A disappontment.,"I just finished listening to this book on Audio CD. Let me clarify; I didn't actually listen to the entire story. I simply got tired of listening to a story that dragged on and on without much action. I enjoyed ""The Firm"" and ""The Pelican Brief."" Those novels had suspense and drama, action, a deadline, chasing. ""The King of Torts"" has none of that. I took the lazy way and had someone else read it to me. Otherwise, I might not have read very much of it.The book starts out smart as the plot develops. But during the second half, I realized the plot was not building toward anything. I didn't find myself wondering (or caring) what was going to happen next.I have just a few chapters left, but I really don't care how it finishes. I'm going to find something else more interesting."
4,Good Book!!,"If you like books closer to real life, where the line between villian and victim is grey, you will probably find this a very good book.I thoroughly enjoyed this book for the main reason many didn't, you had to look to your own moral compass to distinguish sinner and saint and not rely on the author to all but spell it out for you. Which I believe gets us just a little more acquainted with who we are.John Grisham, as his manner is, takes the reader on another crash course of law, in this book, tort litigation. John Grisham is adept at weaving this education into his books without you realizing it until you get into a conversation with someone and the things you read roll of your tongue as if you are an expert yourself.The story line was excellent, interesting and insightful. However, the romance is a bit vague and disconneted (to me this has never been one of Grisham's strong suits anyway). Overall, I found it to be a book hard to put down."
3,"Entertaining, but where is the ending?","Grisham has the power to entertain which continues with King of Torts. A frustrated lawyer in the public defenders office gets a taste of wealth and fame that proves to be addicting and takes him on a wild ride that can only end in disaster. Along the way, this book is an indictment (and education for the reader) against greedy lawyers who grow wealthy through the filing of mass class actions. What makes Grisham so enjoyable is his ability to make the characters seem alive. In this book, I found myself wondering what I would do in such a situation. The reader is a fly on the wall of the tale of a protagonist on a downward moral spiral worthy of a rock star. Unfortunately, just when the plot starts to climax, the book screeches to a halt. Although he created a great story-line, Grisham owed us an ending too."
3,Predictable and Disappointing,"The King of TortsThis book began with promise but tapered off to a predictable ending. Hardworking and underpaid public defender J. Clay Carter becomes ensnared in the vulture culture of mass tort litigation and greedy trial lawyers. Although he easily adjusts to the trappings of the easy wealth that comes with massive fees earned in his schemes, he ultimately learns that everything comes with a price. This book is an indictment against trial lawyers and class action law suits brought against deep pocket corporations and their entities.Grisham can do better than this. The book may have held my interest more if there was a twist in the ending revolving around the illusive and mysterious fireman Max Pace and the vacuous Ridley."
3,Much less good than The Brethren and Rainmaker,"I really enjoyed The Brethren and Rainmaker. Both those books had charm. In the Brethren, there was a bunch of ""lovable rogues""...the book was written with obvious pleasure, which the reader could enjoy.On the other hand, The King Of Torts is too mechanical.I have not yet read the full book, but half of it reads like a manual on how to start a stellar law business. Almost there should be a web site where you could download the financial spreadsheets that are discussed in the book....a slight disappointment for me."
5,Grisham at his best,"As you read his novels, you get wrapped up in the story line, that you feel the emotions, passion, elation, and regret."
1,The king has fallen and cannot find his crown. :(,"The main conflict does not happen until about 1/4 of the way through. It should have happened much earlier. I almost stopped reading at that point, wish I had. The first quarter of the story could have been condensed, and it would have made it much more interesting. I wish I could say the rest of the 2/3 of the book was good. :* The rest was predictable, trite and shallow. Shall I go on? Why? What a waste of time. Sorry Grisham - a miss."
5,Very entertaining !,"I totally enjoyed reading the King of Torts. It was unpredictable from the beginning to the end with lots of character development and intrigue. I thought the ending would have been different as I was hoping that Clay would have been rescued in the final minutes by a huge settlement. Of course, this would only have delayed the self destructive direction of Clay Carter and his legal ""get rich quick scheme"". The story provided an interesting insight into the Tort legal process with all of the moral and ethical issues overshadowed by greed."
2,Grisham not getting any better,This is by far one of Grishams lesser novels. The Summons sputtered and died at the end and this dog was sputtered and died after the third chapter.
3,"If it were a movie, I'd say ""wait for the video""","I love Grisham's books mainly because they are interesting and not too deep. I liked this book because it taught me about torts which I previously knew nothing about. Otherwise the story is pretty weak, nothing unpredictable happens, the guy starts at the bottom, gets to the top, then falls to the bottom and becomes ""humble"". That's pretty much it. I wouldn't say it was a waste of time reading it but it sure wasn't worth paying for the hardback. Wait for paperback or borrow the book from someone."
1,Waste of time...,"I love John Grisham, at least the old John Grisham. THE FIRM and THE PELICAN BRIEF were classics. Underdog lawyer trying to do the right thing, terrible greed, and exciting plot twists that kept the pages turning very fast. But The KING OF TORTS was just a story of the underdog lawyer, so to speak, immense greed, but no interesting subplots or twists that kept you going. At page 324, I decided to skip ahead to page 424 to finish it. I found that I missed nothing in those 100 pages that I didn't read that I couldn't figure out by page 427. This book left me very unsatisfied, as did the wwful THE SUMMONS and wondering if John Grisham has just lost his original touch to write a great legal thriller. I hope not."
2,Not as good as his others.,"I am a John Grisham reader and fan. Normally I enjoy his novels. I did not particularly like this one. Primarily because the main character, a public defender turned tort lawyer, is greedy, shallow, and ridiculously naive. Unlike other Grisham novels where the hero is trying to fight society's wrongs (or at least the Firm's), this book's plot is about screwing the little people (even ruining an entire small town) to make millions and buy jets. I found the whole concept rather disgusting and the hero got off way too easy in the end."
1,Couldn't finish,"Characters are flat, unlikable. Not one had any redeeming qualities. The plot makes no sense. There is no plausable explanation for the protagonist's radical change in worldview. Unlike JG's other works, there was no suspense, drama. I kept reading, hoping that eventually it would pick up. After getting about 3/4 of the way through, I found that it never improved."
3,"A fine read, but a disappointing ending.","John Grisham's stories can never be described as boring. I began reading King of Torts in the same vein as some of his better novels - speeding through the book, always eager to see what the next page held. The book was indeed enthralling. Sadly, the ending of the book was significantly poor, and really disappointed me. Grisham has been guilty in the past of wrapping up the endings of his books neatly and in an attempt to break from this tradition, he simply has very little ending at all. It almost seems as though Grisham was rushing to meet a deadline over the last 20 pages. The book leaves a lot of loose ends and as I closed King of Torts, I was struck with a feeling of...incompleteness. But, minus the ending, the book is a great read and a classic Grisham lawyer yarn."
3,OK Read!,"A good read and somewhat plausible. A young man seduced by the promise of quick success. He tries to share this success with his friends, but his clients are another story. The ending appears a bit too slick with the message that whatever hurt you've been responsible for, you will not necessarily pay the price that justice requires."
2,Boring as it gets,"This book was just plain boring. I really liked Grisham's older work, and even more recently The Brethern. But this book was so unexciting. I didn't even look forward to where I left off. I think I'm finished with Grisham."
3,Not Typical Grisham,"This book was certainly not one of Grisham's best, however it was at least good enough to finish. The plot was extremely predictable. Halfway throught the book the ending could be predicted. A few plot twists would have helped the book along. Ghrisham has written some great books, it's just that isn't one of them."
1,King of Tedium,"The first and last 30 pages were okay. It was the middle 310 that were the problem. It reads as though it has been cranked out like the mass tort settlements Grisham loathes. This book could use some serious editing. It is also cynical, cliched, and predictable. To be sure, this is nothing new. Grisham's books are typically cynical, cliched, predictable, and in need of editing. What is different is that this book inspires little more than long fits of boredom punctuated by short bursts of tedium. Grisham thrillers are usually at least, well, thrilling. Not this one. I admit that because I liked the Summons, I'll buy the next one. But if they come out any faster, the bookstores are going to have to start selling them on the magazine racks."
2,Disappointing,"This is the same story that Mr. Grisham has told before with a different cast. A young lawyer sells his soul for money. He rises like a rocket from nowhere to become the ""King of Torts"". His subsequent fall is no less than meteoric. The ending is less than satisfying. Wait for the paperback."
4,Captivating,"John Grisham never misses a beat. Had me hooked half way through the first chapter. Kept itup to the very end,"
2,Not one of his best...,"I've read almost all of Grisham's books and can usually count on them for a good read. This book disappointed me greatly. The main characters, Clay and Rebecca, don't turn out to be very likeable; he's as greedy as all lawyers are made out to be and she's a golddigger. I found myself not caring whether they got back together, and actually hoping he might do some jail time.At the end we find out that greed is good if the cards fall your way, and if they don't, well, you still get the girl, your friends will give you some of their misbegotten fortune, and you can fly off to London and start a new life. Quoting, ""He had Rebecca all to himself, and nothing else mattered."" Well how about the thousands of people he screwed over in order to maximize his own wealth... don't they matter?Grisham did a good job of exposing the greed behind mass tort reform, but the story he wrote as a vehicle for his expose left me cold."
1,Not Grisham's Best,"I was about half way through this book when I realized it was going nowhere. I was expecting something, anything, to happen. The characters were thin and the plot bounced along from case to case. Really glad it's over."
2,Yawn..............,"I have read all of Grisham's works and this is one of the least impressive. The plot was predictable: Down on luck lawyer has woman problems, mystery man gives him the case of a lifetime, lawyer makes tons of money, gets investigated, loses money, gets girl back. I knew the ending around the fourth or fifth chapter. Grisham has to get out of the rut he is in before his loyal fans go away."
1,Don't read if you just read The Runaway Jury!!!,"While not too spectacular, it does make for fast reading. I bought this book because I am a Grisham fan, but it did not live up to my expectations. Now I'm afraid to buy The Bleachers. I hope that, like this one, it will not be a waste of money."
1,Half decent writing - piss poor plot!,"After having read a number of Grisham's novels, this was the most dissapointing. I suppose it started out strongly, you know... classical Grisham. But then something went wrong and the plot never recovered. The characters were shallow and one dimensional and the ending fizzled out. I finished the book feeling cheated. How I wish I could get those hours back!"
5,Eric The New King of Torts,I happend to like this John Grisham book. Alot of other reveiws said that it did not keep you on your toes. I Thought the characters had multiple levels to them. I just did not like how the book had a sudden change to it. The book did make up an unbeilevable story about the drug that made tequila kill people. The whole rags to riches was kinda hard to believe about clay carter too. Overall I did enjoy wandering what hoop to jump through next.
3,same ole same ole thing,"This book is a ""typical"" book and there aren't any surprises even the ending is expected and been written before in many of his books. I am disappointed in his last three books. I keep hoping for ""Time to Kill"" and ""The Firm"" quality....but now it just seems he is writing more for the money."
2,Okay for Grisham,This book is oaky if you REALLY like the legal issues dealt with in the book and the under current conditions of tort reform in the United States at this point in time. But if you want a suprise twist or a murder or two; this is NOT your book.
1,Still not satisfied,"Like the other reviewers above, I too have read all of John Grisham's books. The last few have left me very disappointed.You always say to yourself that the next one will be better, back to the days of A Time to Kill or The Firm. In The King of Torts I find nothing sensational in the characters or the plot. This book could have taken so many directions to be suspenceful but it didn't,. You read to the end and you find yourself left way short. So we received a short lesson on mass tort litigation.What happened to all the characters? Why was Clay Carter chosen...it asks but never answers. Is this an economics book or a mystery? All I now is I am done.. if you want to read this definitely wait for the bargain table at your bookstore. Talk about mass tort lawyers being slime...what about lawyers turned authors who don't take the time to write a good book."
2,Disappointed again,"I read this book very quickly, not because it was a real suspenseful page turner, but because I kept thinking that surely the next page would be better than the last - when is something going to happen? This book was so predictable to me - Clay was a struggling PD with a snobbish girlfriend and even more snobbish future in-laws. He became filthy rich, through less than honest means, and embarked on a journey that had a inevitable ending. It was just a matter of time before he began losing everything and I wasn't disappointed in that respect. I will probably wait to buy his next book on the bargain rack or in paperback."
1,"Not the best, but okay","Could have been better, I felt the best book in today's market is, Ross P. Psuty's ""Tales of the Axe"" 5 stars"
1,never again Grisham,"After reading the worst book of my life, A Painted House by this author, I have vowed to never turn over another penny for his meaningless, pointless stories. Good reading all."
3,NOT GRISHAMS BEST WORK,WESTART WITH OUR MAIN CHARACTER CLAY CARTER WHO WORKS FOR THE PUBLIC DEFENDERS OFFICE IN WASHINGTON D.C. WHEN THE JUDGE GIVES HIM TH CASE OF TEQUILA WATSON WHO IS CHARGED WITH MURDER.THE MURDER SEEMS RANDOM BUT AS THE STORY MOVES ON YOU WILL SEE THAT THIS IS NOT THE CASE.AT THIS POINT MR. CARTER IS APPROACHED WITH A BUSINESS PROPASITON TO BECOME A TORT ATTORNEY ( CLASS ACTION ATTORNEY) WITH THE POTENTIAL TO GO FROM A POOR PUBLIC DEFENDER TO A VERY RICH ATTORNEY AND POSSABILY THE KING OF TORTS. I WAIT ALL YEAR FOR THE NEW GRISHAM BOOK AND COULD NOT WAIT FOR THIS ONE BUT WAS ALITTLE DISAPPOINTED THIS DID NOT SEEM TO HAVE A BUILD UP TO A GRAND CONCLUSION.IT WAS A PRETTY STEADY READ BUT I FELT GRISHAMS TESTAMENT OR THE PARTNER WERE BETTER BOOKS. HOPE THE NEXT ONE IS BETTER
4,If you like Grisham ...,"If you are a Grisham fan, you will not be disappointed. If you question lawyer's ethics and morals, you will not be disappointed. John Grisham takes us for another spin 'round the legal system, and this time you should fasten you seat belt! A quick and enjoyable read."
3,It was okay.....but nothing like Grisham's earlier works,"I am a huge fan of John Grisham. I have read every single one of his books and to date my favourite has always been A Time to Kill followed by Runaway Jury. However, lately his books are not living up to the same standards he set when he started it all with A Time to Kill. Since The Testament I have been disappointed with his works and frankly have been bored with some of the story lines. The King of Torts, was somewhat enjoyable, but still not as good as I would expect from Grisham. I would still recommend people to read it but don't expect the same quality as his older novels."
1,The King of Torts,"The story just seemed to go no where. Just about a lawyer who took an underhanded deal to make a lot of money and just kept on doing the same thing when other opportunties came along while missing his girl friend the whole time inspirt of the honey on his arm. Of course he lost all the money, never helped out the little community that he broke the biggest employer in and after getting beat up won the old girlfriend back and headed to the islands with some money his over paid employees gave him. John's run out of good lawyer stories."
4,A good readable book,"I enjoyed this book. Sure it was predictable, but it was entertaining and well written. Grisham is a master story teller and develops his characters well."
2,Boring and Predictable,"I am reviewing the audiobook version of this book, which I believe is an abridged version of the original.I found the story shallow and predictable, there were no surprises or intrigue like in Grisham's earlier novels. Perhaps he felt like he exposed the world of mass litigation on his book, but I didn't feel I got any insider info.All in all one of the weakest stories from Grisham that I've read thus far."
3,Good Read,"Interesting insight into tort law and class action suits even though it is fiction. Enjoyed the story, characters were easy to keep up with. Not a page turner for me. Better than the Testament and Runaway Jury. Enjoy Grisham's writing style. I enjoyed The Last Juror more."
4,Legal Thriller Based On Greed,"I found this book particularly interesting because I work in health care. Health care has spawned the side industry of health-related legal settlements. Class action lawsuits have taken this industry to a whole new level, and this book exposes the mechanisms of this legal area with Grisham's usual attention to detail and to the meticulous unfolding of the story. When thousands of people are physically or emotionally harmed by medications, products,etc. and hundreds of millions of dollars are mobilized, who benefits and why? Luxury jets, palacial homes, yachts, Caribbean getaways, mistresses populate this landscape. The view leaves one nauseous. The book has excitement and suspense and moves swiftly to the end."
4,Good fun - just put your credibility on hold,"The popular accusation is that Grisham doesn't cut it like he once did a decade or more ago, and while that's probably true, if this was a debut novel by an unknown writer my guess is that it would be hailed as a triumph and great things would be forecast for his future. I thought this was simply a fascinating story very well told, casting an insight into the monumentally litigious world that is Corporate America, Inc. Of course, Grisham is always at his most convincing in and around the courtroom, and in this tale I was happy not to analyse its accuracy or authenticity and instead just enjoy the wild ride.For the record, I think this is one of Grisham's best efforts of recent years, in particular for entertainment value."
3,"Nothing Earth Shattering Here, Some Fun to Be Had","The King of Torts by John Grisham is an average novel by his standards, probably above average by most other authors standards. The protagonist in this book is gets caught up in the world of mass torts against rich companies, primarily pharmaceutical companies. The sad part of this story is how true it rings. The fact that some ambulance chasing attorneys find opportunity when people fall victim to heartless companies is sad and pathetic.A three star read, not a bad pass time for a plane or beach."
3,The King of Torts,"The King of Torts is like most Grisham books, fast-paced, entertaining, and filled with high-powered lawyers, women, shady informants and a sprinkle of violence. The recipe for a great read. However this book has little else with the exception of an obvious moral at the end trying to teach you something about greed. But mostly it's just about lawyers and money.The story is a very exciting and quick read so if you're looking for something to pickup for a few days and to entertain you go with this or any other John Grisham book. If you've read alot of Grisham and are looking for something else this won't provide that. It's the same story just with different details."
2,Yawn. No suspense. None.,"Could this book be any more boring? Okay, possibly there's some mildly interesting information about mass tort litigation in the United States, but that's about it.There was no suspense about what was going to happen in the end. We all knew Clay Carter's greed and profligate spending would bear a hefty price tag at the end. It did. We knew he'd get the girl. He did.I'm a fan of Grisham's earlier works (""Skipping Christmas"" excepted, of course), but this book comes nowhere close to the level of the others. I kept waiting for something interesting or unexpected to change the course of the story, but it never did."
4,The King of Legal Thrillers,"Grisham is a little like Clay Carter, his protagonist in the King of Torts. He has risen to the top of the legal thriller genre, indeed, he is King, although more recent books have hinted at his possible downfall. Yet Grisham remains at the top of his game with King of Torts. His characterization and plot development is just complex enough to be enjoyed by the masses. (Albeit, there are some slight faults in the plot that a close reader will pick up.) Overall, King of Torts is a predictable but enjoyable (and timely) thriller."
1,Terrible,"Were we supposed to LIKE Clay? What about Ridley or Rebecca?Characters came and vanished from the plot like ghosts.The aspects of the story line that were developed (the trial in Arizona or Rebecca's marriage, for example) were predictable and concluded in a paragraph.I should have known better to pick up this book when my 16 year old (a huge early Grisham fan} couldn't get through 3 chapters of this one.Don't waste your money--based on the descriptions of the ""high life"" in this book--John Grisham doesn't need it."
3,the ending could have been better,"I probably should have given it 4 stars. The book was a quick enjoyable read. The main charachter Clay is someone you root for. I just thought he could have put a better ending especially because Grisham set up and ending that would have been awesome , but he didn't go that root. But how can i rip on a book that took me 2 days to read and didn't want to put it down."
4,No Real Insight into the Legal World but a Fun Read!,"I enjoyed reading this book although I was hoping for something more. As an aspiring lawyer, I was hoping for a captivating insight into tort law and the life of a mass media ambulance chaser. However, I found this installment of Grisham's legal series to be a lot like watching reality tv (All entertainment, no substance). The story had all the drama and romance a popular novel enthuiast could ask for and I found the story line to be a page turner. I would recommend this book for the person who likes a good drama and cares little about the legal field."
3,Same old,"Same plot, different names. Lawyer gets suckered into shady dealings, after many problems complicated by his own character flaws, sees the light and tries to redeem himself. I just wish that the main character could, for once, do some jail time for his misdeeds and not end up on a jet to some foreign paradise with a faithful lover and a couple of mil stashed in a Swiss bank. I did enoy reading about the machinations of class action suits. This book is a good way to spend a few hours on a plane, if one doesn't mind stereotypes."
3,The King of Torts,"After having read some of the other reviews I would have to agree that John Grisham has not put much effort in his last few books. I felt that in The King of Torts he floundered with his character development. I also felt he never completely developed the story.I also had a hard time with the story because it hit a little too close to home for me. I am also taking an arthritis drug of the newer generation and am concerned about potential side effects in the future. My only hope is that I don't end up with as shallow a lawyer as was portrayed in the book if I should!All in all though, I would have to say that if John Grisham put out a book tomorrow I would be one of the first ones in line to buy it!"
1,300 pages and counting.....,"This book has 72 pages left to get good. My wife gave me this book for Valentine's day, and I'm laboring to finish it. I have all of JG's books since the very beginning because I'm a fellow Mississippian. I even have an autographed copy of ""The Client."" ""The King of Torts"" - no mystery, no redeeming qualities in characters, no intrigue - the most boring book I've read in years. Why do I keep buying his books? In the hopes that I'll be pleasantly surprised which hasn't happened in years (with the lone exception being ""A Painted House"")!"
4,King of Torts,Really a good read. I really enojyed the explanation of how torts worked. I know about them but not in as much detail as given in the book. This one rates in the top 5 of my favorite Grisham books.
2,unpredictable predictable,"It has a nice start. An interesting case presents itself to a young lawyer. However, you continue to read and you feel as if there is about to be an interesting plot twist. The only surprise is that it never comes. There is also little if any development of the main character, which there was certainly room for. The book can be read in a minimum anount of time and was at least partially enjoyable during the flight in which I read it. I would wait for the paperback or borrow it. It is not worth the price of the hardcover."
2,Entirely Predictable!,I was disappointed in this book since I thought that it was going to be one of his great legal thrillers with some sort of twist at the end. This book started out really well but halfway through it became entirely predictable. It's like Grisham started the book in his usual style and then got bored and took off for a holiday and let someone else finish it for him. Maybe he should take a much longer holiday!
3,milk-toast,"I expected this book to make many more turns than it did. It was hard to get into, and then when I did, I waited and I waited and I waited.....no meat......then waited for a great ending and was disappointed by the ""settled for"" ending.....John...give us the real you."
4,A real Eye-Opener,We all hear about ambulance chasers but this is written in an eye-opening way and exposes Insurance fraud. Many a lawyer will be quaking in his 'proverbial boots' after reading this one. Grisham lays it out in black and white and does it with finess and in his own style. One of his best works.
3,"Ho-Hum - Too ""Formula""","I used to love Grisham. His novels were fun, fast-paced and exciting. Maybe my literary tastes have changed, but ""King of Torts"" was disappointing. If you want a light read, this may be the ticket for you, but I'm tired of the predictable formula.Grisham gets brownie points for research perhaps, but I thought there were BIG plot holes and credibility problems in this book. I've read almost all that Grisham has written and just get the feeling that his writing is getting watered down as he's ""compelled"" to keep cranking out the books. Yes, we've finally gotten out of the South, but really, this is a pretty flat read."
2,the skipping stone,"We read it because it is Grisham...like a skipping stone. Nothing was developed. It skipped through plot and informed us that possibly our math wasn't as good as it should be. It skipped through characters...Like they were are in the shade waiting for something to happen.In fact, many characters left the book after making their money only to return to save the day and the main character. Yuck, skip it or maybe borrow but do not buy!"
3,The King of Torts,"The Grisham formula has become too predictable. This book follows the familiar lawyer is tempted by something too good to be true, rises to fame and falls to failure within the pages. The characters aren't very endearing and the ending is weak. This book can be a ""beach book"" since it doesn't require a lot of concentration or involvement to read."
2,Worked the first time...,"This is more a moral fable than a thriller... Easy to read, you finish it very fast but not 'cause of the fast pace but because the plot is very very easy. In fact the book has three episodes very similar one to the other: once you've read the first one, the other ones are variations on the same topic, making the terrain ready for the big and very predictable crash of the main character since the tenth page. At the end, you don't have the sensation of having pass through a great and creative plot, but a soft ride in some park: just above plain boring, enough to be finished and take another novel without a second thought about this one. ""The firm"" or ""The client"" or ""The jury"" are very far away now."
2,More predictable than his other works,"The King of Torts starts out with a compelling story about a lawyer who is determined to be his own man, but quickly falls into a predictable tale of compromising your ethics to make a fast buck. The last 200 or so pages predictably depict the rise and fall of a greedy personal injury lawyer on a mass scale. I kept reading waiting for the twist that Grisham often puts in his novels, but was left wanting in the end. I really enjoyed his earlier works, including the non-legal ones, and hope that Grisham once again takes a chance in his writing with twists and turns to keep the reader interested."
3,Deja vu,"How many stories has Grisham written now in which the protagonist is lured by, and corrupted by, huge sums of money? I've lost count. But people keep buying the books. I can only conclude that readers like to fantasize about being in such a situation -- coming into possession of millions and millions of dollars, saying goodbye to job and humdrum life and living -- at least for a while -- like Patton French on his 200-foot yacht or his Gulfstream V, downing shrimp and steak and vintage wines etc. Speaking of which -- Patton French AGAIN? Is Grisham going to keep bringing him into his novels, or maybe even center the next story around him?"
3,A return to form for Grisham - almost,"Just finished reading the book in question. Better than his last few titles (Testament, Summons, Brethren) but realy, not a big deal. Your life won't be changed if you read it.Grisham's heroes are always incredibly passive: things HAPPEN to them, and they don't actively fight for their survival or the things they want. Case in point: boy loves girl, boy loses girl, boy makes a 100 million USD (again almost by chance and by the machinations of others), then girl decides to come back into boy's life.You'll know the formula for his protagonists' character arc by now. Also, a lot of the description in his books are of the ""tell, don't show"" format, which can be dull, and reading it can be like reading an affidavit (albeit a well-written, concise one). Which is what one wants while waiting for the plane, or lying by the pool."
4,A good read...,"A public defender is given the chance to settle a class action lawsuit before it gets known publically. He then is given the documentation for another case against a major drug manufacturer. He wins and ends up enormously rich, but then greed takes over. He goes for a third case, but ends up burning through money at an incredible rate. Meanwhile, the FBI and SEC are looking into his background, and he's facing malpractice from the second case when it turns out the drug was even worse than expected (and the settlement is peanuts). A good look at greed and what it can do to you."
4,A Quick Read,"After making young inexperienced lawyers the heros of his novels in the past, Grisham finally sticks it to greedy, blood-sucking trial lawyers. He does a great job of exposing the fraud that goes on in the mass tort field today. Although a work of fiction, there is a lot of truth to many of the points he makes including the fact that there really is an organized group of trial lawyers who meet to discuss who to bring down next. These people are what gives the profession such a bad reputation. I think a lot of these ""mass tort"" lawyers ought to be investigated for insider trading and unethical legal practices. They are ruining corporations and costing us all money. And no, I'm not a CEO or anything; just your average citizen that sees what's going on out there in our ever-increasing litigious society."
3,"Solid read, worth the time but not an instant classic","Grisham continues to bring me back for each new story, yet not blow me away when they come. This one was a good solid read, which I admit I looked forward to getting back into each night, yet when complete I wasn't totally impressed. While I still encourage Grisham lovers to invest in this new story, I long for the day that he truly comes back and hits us between the eyes..."
3,Check It Out At The Library,"I never bought a Grisham book. Would always check them out at the library. And I really like his writings and always look forward to them coming out each year. This time I purchased the hardback, and I was really dissapointed that I spent all that money."
2,The King of Torts - Review by Mario Baldassarrini,I have found this book rather boring - not quite like the other books by Grisham
3,Enjoyable,"Like most ""legal thrillers,"" this story was not very believable or plausible but it is exciting nonetheless. The protagonist, who yearns for fame and money, desires to leave his dead end job at the public defender's office and hits the ""legal"" lotto, so to speak. A story in which the author tells how we can fall so far and so fast when greed gets the better of us."
2,Not one of my favorite books,"This book started off really well, and I was preparing for a wonderful story. I was dissapointed. The story drags, and you tend to get really tired of it. If you have no interest in law, then you may find this book boring. The story is very predictable, and comes off as just a moral lesson. Clay Carter who starts off as the good and humble guy, gets greedy. He pays a huge price for his greed. and then gets back with the love of his life at the end. Not one of my favorite books."
3,Just not as riveting as his earlier books,"Maybe it's me but I don't find these later books as riveting as the early ones. I just finished the Summons which disappointed me and before that King of Torts. While I am enthralled by the mega-billions that changed hands in this book, I mean the sheer greed was enough to keep me interested but the end sucked. I can't believe I suffered through that for nothing."
4,Not Grisham's Best,"This book allows John Grisham to showcase the ugly aspects of the world of mass torts. Here Clay an aspiring young lawyer goes from ruins as a public defender to riches and back to ruins in a matter of pages. Clay's quest for happiness will keep you entertained as he tries out supermodels, houses, planes, yachts and other material goods. While the emotions and characters are realistic the outcome is sadly predictable. For Grisham fans this is a must read despite it not being even close to his best work."
3,cool movie,"If you're looking for a good page-turner I'd recommend this book. I found the lead character likeable, and his ride to riches, fun and exciting. The story whooshed along like a cool movie you can't take your eyes off. (I kept seeing Charlie Sheen as Carter). I wish Grisham gave this book a little more substance and suspense towards the end so I could give it more than 3 stars, but it still was a good read."
2,Grisham just spit this one out to make an extra buck,"Young lawyer lucks out, gets rich, gets greedy, learns lesson. You can see it coming a mile away. Hardly to the standard I expected from this author."
3,A thin read,"I am an avid reader of John Grisham. Several of his books do an excellent job building characters, plot, background, and provide a good descriptions of the time and place the story takes place. The ""Painted House"" and ""A Time to Kill"" are examples of such books. Unfortunately, this one is another ""Cookie Cutter"" book by John Grisham. He has the template for a great book. It glosses over places where details would make the book more intriguing. This book with 150 more pages of plot and character development and developement would have made it an outstanding read."
1,So Disappointed,We listened to this book on tape during a very long drive across the country. That is the good part. It was better than random FM or AM stations. I was very disappointed in the lack of conclusion. It was as though his time was up and he quit writing. Morality tale? The main character ... had a few million flowing around him .... Not like he was a pauper or back to OPD. Characters were dropped off and not resolved. Story lines were abandoned. Sure this is a wonderful morality tale. Don't fall for the Grisham hype again.
2,King of torts,"Among his most recent disappointments King of Torts is quite reasonable but in no way near the quality of books which John Grisham has written in the distant past. The start of the book is good but the end is abrupt. I suspected halfway in the book that what if the hero gets beaten up badly buy a grieved client and the book ends. And exactly that happened. I wonder what has happen to this talented and used to be entertaining writer. I am glad that I did not pay for this book, got it as a gift."
1,Pure [doo-doo],"Not only is the plot stupid (a shady character tips a lawyer off who proceeds to roll the dice and hopes his mega-suits settle) but the main character completely violates the main rule of fiction - he is so greedy and evil that you hope he goes down in flames. By virtue of the fact that he's the main character, and therefore ought to be sympathetic, his final come-uppance is deeply flawed. He doesn't pay for his crimes and his redeeming vlues are so meager you can't help but feel that the time spent reading this has been wholly wasted. It's time to send Grisham to Iraq."
1,Big Disappointment,"Unless you want to learn about mass tort law, skip this book. It's boring. The main character isn't even likeable! A great disappointment and waste of money."
1,Where's the beef,"Like many of Grisham's recent works, this one disappointed mightly. The first 3/4 of the work was interesting although many questions were left unanswered. The ending is where I really felt disappointed and betrayed. It's as though he's writing to a certain page count and suddenly realized he only has a few pages left and so abruptly cuts to the end. I thoroughly enjoyed his earlier books which were well developed all the way through but his more recent efforts have displayed a tendency to just throw out some ending to meet either a page count limit or a publisher's deadline. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK. Use the copy from your local library if you want to read it. One can only hope that this once interesting author will put more effort into his future efforts."
3,informative,"If you are unfamiliar with the actions and techniques of tort ""lawyers"" this is a good read for you. I learned more than I really wanted to about the rampant greed in the ""good ole U. S. of A."" by people who call themselves lawyers when in reality they are just greedy self-serving billionaires. The story moved along well but, he has written more gripping novels."
2,A little disappointed,Love John Grisham's work but I thought this was a little too boring. Definitely buy it used!
2,Disappointing,A most unlikeable main character...throughout the dreary book. A very disappointing Grisham book.
3,Greedy Author Pans Greedy Lawyers,"A morality tale of a naive and greedy young attorney, rags to riches to rags, the SEC and the Caribbean. Sound familiar? This book is a quick read simply because you can't wait to see if Grisham has the audacity to end his book the way you know he's going to end it from page one. Exceptionally irritating is he doesn't even have the creativity or literary courage to change locations. Take a trip to Disneyworld on your next vacation for a change! Mr. Grisham brazenly recycles the same plot over and over and over again solely because he knows he can get away with it. We will pay him handsomely to do it. The irony? We fools pay this cynical and greedy man millions to write morality tales dripping with indignation about lawyers getting millions.Grisham obviously wrote ""King of Torts"" for his advance and his book contract. If you want an attorney morality tale with substance and just as much entertainment value, read A Civil Action."
4,"4 stars if you've never read Grisham, 3 stars if you have","This book is a typical, predictable book about greedy lawyers. If you haven't read any Grisham before, you'll think it's a great book. If you've read him before, you'll know that it's not in the league with ""A Time to Kill,"" ""The Firm,"" or ""The Partner."" There must a lot you can say about lawyers besides their greed.We never really find out why Rebecca is so appealing to him. Does he want her only because he can't have her? Clay admits that the romance was over - why then the change of heart?He does treat his best friends well, I'll give him that. But they did work for it. However, a lesser person would not have been so generous and it works out for him in the end.AGain, not one of Grisham's better efforts, kind of in the middle of the pack. Grisham has also written worst books. He might want to explore something other than greedy lawyers next time."
2,Such A Dissapointment,"I had hoped that this book would redeem Grisham for the past couple books he wrote, but alas, it has not. I thought that it could not get worse from The Summons, but again, it has.The story had no real direction, and I could not figure out the moral of the story. There was no restitution or retribution like there usually is in his other novels. It's just a story about a greedy lawyer. Nothing else, just his greed, and the extent he will go to get it. I will say nothing else but hope that his next book will be an improvement."
4,Grisham keeps up the good work,In this book he shows just how greedy people are. This is an absolutly great book for people to read so they can possibly open their eyes and realize just how bad greed can really be. There is also a good love story in it too. Grisham keeps up the good work with another great book!
5,Magnificent,"While this is the first Grisham book I have read (and I do intend to read all of his books) I can certainly say that this book is outstanding. At times I would sit down to read and I had in mind only to read for maybe a half-hour. That half-hour turned into two hours as the suspense dramatically increased.John Grisham's ending was perfect; a great way to end a novel that began modestly and became increasingly enthralling.Grisham's lastest book will certainly keep you turning the pages, the plot stalling you from putting it down."
3,Great Taste . . . Less Filling,It's always the guys with multi-millions who write little parables purporting to show how . . . money isn't everything.Puuullleassee!
3,Latest Grisham Is His Weakest To Date,"Looking for suspense? Memorable characters? Surprising plot twists? Well, you'd better look elsewhere, because you certainly won't find them in ""The King Of Torts"". I've read all of John Grisham's novels and this is easily the weakest effort of his career. The ""greed is bad"" message is simplistic and the story line utterly predictable. It seems as if Grisham is hell bent on sacrificing everything -- nuance, character development -- in order to move things along. The result is a page-turner with absolutely no meat. If you're not a Grisham fan, ""The King Of Torts"" isn't going to change your mind."
3,"Mr. Publisher, Let the Man Rest a While","Like all Grisham novels, the words flow smoothly, except with this volume there just isn't much of a story. Yet I suspect this has little to do with the author and much to do with his publisher who is pushing to get another book by this big money-maker out the door. If you're reading, publisher, sit back for awhile and let the man write a great tale as we all know he can. In this story, composing a summary in one's mind of what will happen to the main character Clay Carter is all too easy almost from the very beginning, and that shouldn't be. For a good alternative read, try 'Spine.'"
4,"Fun, Fun, Fun till Daddy takes the Money away...","Ok, daddy doesn't take the money away and it doesn't matter who does (why ruin the story?), but Grisham who had begun to bore me with more recent legal thrillers (the summons? snooze) tells a fascinating story that flies by. It is not a thriller--it more an inside look at a part of American law that can be disgusting (tobacco lawyers?)--but regardless of your feeling about the torts system, it is just a good story. Grisham is no hemingway (alas, or even a Turow), but the story is fascinating."
3,Not up to Grisham's other efforts,"This book as well as Bleachers is well below other thrillers I have read by this author. The book merely tells the story of a mass tort lawyer, and how fast he can rise to the top and fall back down. It seems that Grisham does a lot better when he is writing thrillers!"
2,Really weak.,"The subject matter is compelling and interested me, but Mr. Grisham should have limited his scope (and page count) to an Op-Ed piece or a magazine article. There is simply no story here. None. You keep turning the pages waiting for something to happen -- surely this character will have an antagonist of some sort other than (or in addition to) the obvious one, himself. But no.This ""novel"" functions as a diatribe against greedy trial lawyers, much of which I agree with, but it's not a story."
2,Disappointed,"I love the way Grisham writes. His characters are wonderful. However, I was really disappointed in this book. Like most people, I have a very busy life. Finding time to read an entire novel is such a hard thing for me to do. So I was very sad to see the 'hero', Clay,be such a greedy, cliche character. It somehow was made even worse by his tragic end, even though I suppose he deserved it. I would just like to read something a bit more uplifting - like Clay learns his lesson, but comes out with at least some dignity and money. The last Grisham book I read, Painted House, had an ending that also left me feeling empty, like there should be more to it. So I guess when I find a few precious moments to read, my next book will not be authored by John Grisham."
4,Sue them all!,"If you ever wanted to know some details about class-action lawsuits and the lawyers that generate them, this book is for you. You get to see how a tort case can transform a young, poor, public defender into a super wealthy head of his own law firm, specializing in suing large companies for millions of dollars. You also will see the sleazy side of this business and the damage these lawsuits cause to the community.I enjoyed this novel for the most part and finished it in 24 hours. The pacing is quick, and there isn't that much legal mumbo-jumbo included. I guess the main message is ""Don't kill the golden goose."""
1,Save 4 hours of your life!,"This is another book that the publishing industry has marketed to make money. Grisham has done much better. While the book is a quick read, it does nothing to engage the reader. Grisham creates characters whose actions are not only unbelievable but also unlikeable. There is no reason for the events that they find themselves entangled. Ensuing chapters read like a blow by blow a year in the life of a tort laywer. No lasting impressions and no redeeming qualities to this work. Save 4 hours of your life!"
3,Continuation of the Current Grisham Trend,"Recent law-based books by Grisham have focused on unsympathetic characters and shady legal practices. From reading the reviews I was hoping for a story similar to the rainmaker. Unfortunately, I faced another novel in the vein of The Summons The Brethren and The Partner.He has written better."
4,A good legal thriller,Agreed that this is not as good as other John Grisham works. But definitely a worthy read - goes into the inner workings of how the tort system works - the good and bad of it - how it destroys companies and people employed.The book is certainly not a bad read - once you start reading you will want to keep reading it till you finish reading it. If you havent read it - it is definitely worth a read.
3,Not Grisham's best,This Grisham tale is a bit stale and predictable. I did not have to struggle to finish it but there was more substance in Playing for Pizza.
2,No characters to like!,"John Grisham always does such a good job of fleshing out characters. So much so that the protagonists have their faults and the antagonists seems plausible. Here, the main character, Clay, just didn't appeal to me at all. I seemed to be rooting against him. There was no one to root for. I know every book doesn't need those things but Grisham's novels usually do. Oh well, they all can't be gems."
2,Drag... Drag... Drag... Where is the content?,"Grisham is a good writer, yet...This story lacks action. It drags on without much happening. One can easily rewrite the whole book in ten pages. To make this a better book, more twists could have been added."
3,rather unbelieveable,"Although I haven't finished reading the book yet, it certainly is not my favorite Grisham novel. His other books have been real page-turners, keeping me enthralled throughout. In this one, the main character (Clay Carter) is not very appealing, especially because he seems to be very shallow and egocentric (so far). The plot still hasn't gripped me (not like The Rainmaker or The Summons - couldn't put those down!) After checking the other reviews, I can see that many others feel the same way. No wonder I keep getting distracted. . . ."
3,Not Very Exciting,"Starts out good. Gets really slow in the middle. Predictable ending. The book is constantly going on and on about how much money the main character is spending. Guess what happens to him in the end? Yeah, your right.Not one of Grisham's best but he has proved his worth in the past and I will continue reading whatever he publishes."
3,Very mediocre,"Disappointing read. It starts with the potential of being a good thriller, but goes nowhere. I kept expecting some twist somewhere, but nothing happened. Just basic story of greed will get you in trouble. Don't buy it, read it from the library."
2,Typical Grisham,"Typical Grisham book-Young lawyer against the world-makes money-loses it-sails away.....however, easy reading for those who don't read often."
2,another #1for JG?,"I believe if Grisham wrote a book on the proper way to hold your fork while eating, that it would go to the top of the bestseller list. I for one do not understand it. Grisham uses his public popularity to not only put his political views on display (like Tom Clancy), but also his morality views. If the writing were of a higher quality I might see how his books go to #1, but his last 4 (exculding Skipping Christmas) were dogs. I mean if an unknown author took this stuff to a publisher there is no way it would ever get put in print. Anyway The King of Torts lacked suspense, believeability, and was a bore to read. I am glad I borrowed it."
1,BORING,"I have been a fan of Mr. Grisham since his first novel. But this one was not worth reading. The characters are one dimensional (not even good enough to be called two dimensional) the story in flat and uninspired. There is VERY little dialog beween the characters, rather most of the story is written in the third person. I was surprised that the price had a...discount sticker on it when I bought it. Now, I know why and it was overpriced even with the discount!!"
1,Give me a break,Oh no...this is surly not the great John Grisham who wrote this book. Come on. What is going on here. This book is full of trash. Aint written by the Grisham who wrote The Client. Dont waste your money folks.
1,a waste of effort,"What is good about the book: the information it gives on all the players involved in mass tort legislation -- defendants, litigants, and the attorneys. If Grisham's goal was to reduce the likelihood of people signing on with frivolous mass torts, he convinced me; I have received solicitations to join in on three different mas torts in the past few months, and now refuse to do anything to help those attorneys and their ilk make a fortune while making a mountain out of a molehill.However, I think Aesop's story of greed was more effective, succinct, and interesting. As far as entertainment goes, this book is a loser. I kept waiting for the plot to thicken, and it never happened. I think Grisham is riding on his own coattails."
2,VERY Disappointing,"If you would like to read this book, don't buy it....borrow it from a friend.I gave it 2 stars because I learned quite a lot about class action suits. However, other than that it is not worth it.Major problem: No character development, and most notably for the main character, although others in the book are just as badly developed, or should I say not developed at all.I would not say this is one of Grisham's best...but I would definitely say it's one of his worst."
3,It 's a difficult review,"This book is the first one that is difficult to me to review it, is a book that will keep you reading, but is not a real good book, is a book that doesn't goes out of the story but sometimes is a little bit boring, is a book that it really has three separate stories that at the end the last one join to the first story, it has a love story that it isn't a love story but it ends like Cinderella, I really don't know what to say, I can't tell you that this book is a waste of time but I can't recommend to you as a good book, but you will have to read it to understand me.I am not a lawyer so I don't know if that end is possible or not. But even if you are a lawyer you have to take care of the sues you make, your work could be against you."
3,Grisham Gets Greater Depth,"Usually a prolific writer like Grisham gets a bit stale if he is not up to standards that he as set for him/herself in previous novels. But, in this particular novel, Grisham sets a new level for ingenuity and complexity in plot and character development.Other reviews have mentioned the strange plot and design of the novel which will hold the reader in thrall. I suggest that if the artist keeps up with the branching out into new areas that are in this book, he will never disappoint. Excellent look into what is wrong with the profession today and how to correctit."
1,Interesting story line...... Needed more though,"I've read a bunch of Grisham's novel, not all of them, and this was ok. I found the story line to be rather interesting and learned a lot how the tort system works. Yet, my main problem with this book is that Grisham seemed to start a dilemma with the main character and then it was quickly resolved and onto a new problem. I felt a lot of this book was rushed and it could have gotten into more detail. I also noticed that many of his newer works seem to to be almost exactly the same length in pages. I am wondering if he has to meet a page limit and a lot gets cut out of the finished product.Overall I think this was a decent work but still doesn't live up to his very early works. Also, after reading the Summons, a lot of the info regarding torts was discussed in The Summons and it seemed like a copy and paste job was done."
3,Not as interesting as his first works,"John Grisham used to be one of my favorite authors, but his last few books have been disappointing, especially this last one. H.G"
1,False advertisement,"Imagine for a minute if you will, reading a inside jacket of a book, which states ""As he digs into the background of his client, Clay stumbles on a conspiracy too horrible to believe.."" Okay, my first impression was this is interesting...okay let me summarize the book, Lawyer, by the name of Clay, gets a client he didn't like...wants to dump client...meets with a guy by the name of Max Pace...offers him a get rich scheme...somewhere in between is Clay's woman, who marries a guy she doesn't like...in the end Clay loses all his money....gets his lady back and moves out of the States..There is not conspiracy...no thrill...no suspense...basically the book is lame...the only reason I read up to anywhere was because I was still waiting on the ""Conspiracy too horrible to believe..."" which never materialized and frankly I think it was just to get fans of Grisham to buy the book."
4,"A VERY, VERY FUN READ","I THOUGHT THAT THIS BOOK WAS A LOT OF FUN TO READ.IT WAS ALSO A VERY, VERY FAST READ---DIDN'T DRAG ON.WHAT I THOUGHT WAS KINDA INTERESTING WAS THAT IT REMINDED ME A LOTOF """"FLOWERS FOR ALGERNON"""" ((THE BOOK)) OR """"CHARLY"""" ((THE MOVIE))---IN THAT THEY BOTH TELL THE SAME STORIES.SOMEONE WHO IS DOWN----THEN THEY GO WAY UP----THEN THE BOTTOM DROPS OUT---AND THEY ARE WAY DOWN AGAIN.LOTS OF LAWYERS---TRIALS----MONEY---AND MORE $$'s---AND MORE LAWYERS---GOTTA LOVE 'EM."
1,Awful Grisham,This book was a HUGE disappointment. I could care less about the title character and there were loose ends galore at the end. Grisham is just pumping out books to fulfill his contract and gone is the writer that gave us The Firm. Borrow it but DO NOT buy it.
2,Grisham must have wrote this over a long weekend,"Having read all previous works by the author, this is one of his weakest. In short, the rise and fall of young lawyer Clay Carter. Unlike previous works, this is definitely not one of Grisham's classic page turners. No surprises, plot twists, etc.Like I said, this is something Grisham can write in his sleep - Let's hope the next book takes him back to his old form."
1,A Book You Just CAN put down!,"The writer of The Painted House, A Time to Kill, and Skipping Christmas shouldn't have wasted his time on this one. It is not a page-turner and it is a book you just CAN put down. I am a fan of Grisham and he has talent that he is squandering on books like this. It was dull; the characters were stilted; the style is a dull narrative... I could go on, but as I said, I am a fan of Grisham. I hope he does better next time. I know he can. I am sure the book will make money, but I don't believe Grisham is all-Clay! Save your money and your time. That way you will avoid disappointment."
3,Could have been better,"An interesting story which was an easy read, and enlightened me to the ways of tort law. For that reason, I gave it the 3 stars. Where it lost the other 2 stars, were the multiple ""better"" story line opportunities passed up on. Also, it seemed rushed to an ending. I could be more specific, but I didn't want to take the chance of ruining the book for anyone who decides to read it."
1,You can see the ending from miles away,"The title character is poorly drawn and oblivious. On the one hand he has the integrity to stand up to potential in laws, but no spine when it comes to a wild get rich quick scheme. Wildly unbelievable, with the twists telegraphed. Save yourself the time."
1,HORRIBLE!!!,"This was the first John Grisham novel I read and I expected more from what I have heard about John Grisham. The plot was horrible and it just dragged on to the predictable and rushed end. Do not even bother with this piece of trash that got accidentally published. I wish I could give this novel zero stars but I cannot. Blah!!! I will use this book for starting a fire in my fireplace. Awful. Disgusting. Horrible. What was Doubleday thinking? So much for ""commercial publishers only publish good novels!"" FILTH!!!"
2,Grisham is getting sloppy,"The same book by any other author's name might have never made it to the bookstores. It is implausible, lacks depth both in terms of characters and plot and is, above all, sloppy. It gives the impression of a job half-done to meet a deadline. Although it reads easily there is an empty aftertaste and a question ""what was that about"". I think Grisham should choose another nom de plume and start over again as his name is slowly becoming a liability."
1,worst book I couldnt finish,"I only regret having to give this book one star. It was awful. I've read all of Grisham's books, my favorite being A Time to Kill, and they're all fairly readable, nothing too taxing on the brain, you know, light stuff and that's ok sometimes. ... I couldn't even finish it. I'm glad I work in a library and don't have to buy books, but I used my job to get this book before anyone else and I'm sorry I wasted my time."
1,The King of Torts,"I cannot believe I bought this book. What a disappointment. The story line is weak; Grisham seems to be more interested in mentioning high dollar brand names than telling a story. It is extremely disapopointing and very boring. I skim read it in about two hours (and that was too much wasted time). If I read another Grisham, and I've read them all so far, it will definitely be the paper back version."
2,Save Your Time (and Money),"This book was extremely disappointing. You keep waiting for something interesting to happen, but you're left waiting... There are way too many events that seem to happen because the author had to fill the pages with something. The characters and the plot are very weak. This is definitely one of Grisham's poorer outputs."
2,"A Courtroom Thriller, Without Courtroom or Thrills","It's an interesting notion: follow a young lawyer's climb up the ladder of civil litigation and his subsequent fall. Too bad Grisham's Clay Carter merely coasts along.There are no stirring courtroom scenes: all the action takes place on cell phones between lawyers. There's no mystery during investigation. There's simply no investigation; a mysterious source provides everything he needs. Clay never questions the man's motives. He never questions the origin of his information. To be honest, he doesn't do much of anything. His career is handed to him, his demise mostly the result of unforseeable events. People come into his life, and most leave with barely a blip.Grisham scratches the potential of civil suits, but doesn't dig deep enough to shed much light on the topic. He implies dark secrets, but nobody bothers to search them out. This book isn't bad, just bland."
2,Where's the climax?,"I started reading this book and liked it very much. Then it ended. With all the build up and the foreshadowing I thought that the climax of the book would be great, but it just wasn't there. The writing is good and the characters are good, but when I was finished with the book I wondered why I had wasted my time on the story."
2,Grisham is Clay,"As many reviewers have pointed out, Grisham is churning out books for the money.This novel is a didactic treatise on the need for tort reform with flat characters that no one can sympathize or empathize with. Like his last few legal ""thrillers"", and I use the term loosely, they seem told plots rather than moving character driven stories like A Painted House. A Painted House shows he can write. King of Torts shows he can make money."
1,I won't buy Grisham anymore after this one,"Can I give this book less than 1 star?I've been losing faith in John Grisham as an author for awhile, but have continued to buy his books because some of them (Runaway Jury) are great reads. The King of Torts, however, has convinced me not to waste my money anymore. The book has no character development, a plot that is 20 years past its prime, and no conclusion of any interest. The whole time I was reading the book, I kept waiting for something - anything! - of interest to happen. I was sorely disappointed.Grisham also lets his readers down by failing to do any research into the Washington, D.C. public defenders office (or any other public defenders office). As Grisham admits in his author's note, the ""OPD"" portrayed in the book is wholly fictionalized because Grisham was too lazy to do any real research or fact checking. If Grisham can't waste his time finding out what a real public defenders office is like, then why should we waste our time on his book?"
3,Frankly Disappointing,"While 'The Summons' holds the distinction of being John Grisham's worst book 'The King of Torts' seems to be quite a contender for the title. From its beginning until its final word, 'The Broker' is a disappointment for even a Grisham wannabe.The preposterous story begins in the traditional Grisham manner: a young lawyer is presented with an unbelieveable opportunity. From that point onward the book is predictable and bland. The solution to the poorly executed mystery is not only nonsensical, it is ridiculously far-fetched.It is difficult to select the specific parts of the book which are a disappointment as there are so many of them. Suffice it to say this book is disappointing and will be a difficult thing to read for even the most dedicated fan of Grisham. If you don't like this book, do yourself a favor and don't even think about reading 'The Summons'."
3,A lesson in the end,"This book chronicles a public defender who takes a leap to make a few more bucks. His moral compass is lost after the loss of his girlfriend (who I am not sure really deserved him anyways). The other characters in the story create the moral guide for the protagonist. However, due to his serious character flaws, he's is a little hard to root for. But then again, I think we all face some temptation in life. Do we let this one little rule slip so that we can gain? Do we take the job for more money, but that requires less ethics? Clay's struggle is one that we all face at some point although not nearly on his scale.This was overall a pretty good book with an ending which will make you think about what is important. It ends like most all of Grisham's books do. If you have read any of his other books, you know what I mean."
1,Not up to usual standards,"I was pretty disappointed with this Grisham novel. I have read most of his and usually expect a lot of suspense and tension towards the end. You could see this ending a mile away, so although it's not a bad story in itself, it certainly has a lot lacking."
2,typical Grisham,"Very average read. Predictable somewhat fun, but if you are going to write an I hate lawyers book you may want to have your hero be a non lawyer once in a while."
4,Enjoyable Read,"I read this book quickly and enjoyed it like I enjoy an occasional candy bar. The lowly lawyer has success thrown at him and it goes straight to his head. Where a normal person would have been satisfied with a 15 million dollar fee for one case and happily retire, he wants more and more and more. Everything goes his way much too easily and in the end it all falls apart too quickly. A lawyer who is surprised when he is accused of insider trading? Not very credible. But I thought it was fun to read.For those who've read the book, one question: did he at least write to poor Tequila who is in prison (strictly speaking) for no fault of his own?"
3,Not Grishams best work,John Grisham is one of my favorite writers and i was very surprised by how this book was. I was really bored half the time and didn't enjoy it like his other novels. I give it three stars because i loved the ending and it was good in some parts.
3,Not bad Grisham,"I picked up KING OF TORTS in an airport bookstore, looking for something to read on the flight. It is one of the few of his over the years I haven't read.By the time my flight landed, I was halfway through the book and when I got home, finished it.It is yet another addicting Grisham book, only this time, more in the technical world of the legal profession. Not really about a big case, but about a lawyer, trying to find ways to rack up fees through class action settlements.The only problems come in the last fifty pages where it essentially falls apart, trying to wrap up too quickly. Not very believable.Still, it is an entertaining, fast paced read. If you are a fan of Grisham, worth picking up. If you've never read him before, maybe not the best one to begin with."
2,Not Impressed,"As a fan of most of Grisham's books, I was dissappointed in King of Torts. The first half was alright, you think something shocking will happen, but it doesnt. Its basically the story of a mass tort lawyer who gets greedy. Big deal..."
1,When will I learn?,"The best thing I can say about this book is that it was a quick read, so I didn't waste too much time on it. Lazily plotted; characters popping up cconveniently to bridge plot points and then disappearing; ridiculous, sloppy ""resolution""; utterly unbelievable, even by Grisham standards. Just to show how quickly and slipshod this book was cranked out, the author picture is one of JG scowling at a book signing for his next book. Save your money."
4,Fun legal thriller,"I really enjoyed this legal thriller, especially compared to some of Grisham's other works, because there was no large evil all-consuming law firm or corporation which put hits out on people. Those trying to ""get"" the protagonist Clay were the SEC and individual citizens--all through legal and established channels.Clay was an excellent protagonist because he was everyman, a man with good ideals and a good heart. He set out thinking that he wouldn't get consumed in the greed of tort law, and then the reader was right along for the ride as he went down the slipperly slope of becoming more talented and powerful.One great quote from p. 183: Mass tort litigation was not practicing law. It was a roguish form of entrepreneurship."
3,Morality bites,"This book is about a small time lawyer (Clay) who hits the big time when he gets involved in Mass tort litigation vis a vis a character named Max Pace. Clay vows not to be changed by the money (millions) he makes but this is not to be. Most of the book centers around Clay making lots of money with relative ease and then spending it in an obscene fashion. Slightly thrilling although I felt Grisham belabored the moral lesson of greed (preach, preach preach)...There's a bit of romance in the book though Grisham could have left that out and you'd still get the point. I wouldn't recommend purchasing this book -- just take it out of the library. This is not one of his better novels but it'll pass the time at least."
3,Entertaining novel,"This has been my first John Grisham novel and I must say I did very much enjoy the plot. It was a unique plot that consisted of a public defender lawyer making it big through illegal means. The book contained subtle bits of humor that made it much more enjoyable. The character of Clay was very likeable and relatable. At times I felt the book was too dragged out and could have been shortened. Also the ending was a bit too predictable and uneventful when compared to the rest of the novel. I had kind of hoped that Clay would have returned to his old job and tried to protect those he had wrongly accused of murder. Overall though, an enjoyable read"
4,It happens too frequently,"This book is frightening as one reads how often companies are sued by lawyers hoping to finally ""make the big bucks"" It was a real page turner/"
2,Political Message,"I thought this book was poorly written. It is simple literature with a political message. The message? Lawyers are evil and only out for the big money. Those who are ""ethical and moral"" need to avoid such law suits, etc."
3,Interesting,"King Of Torts was fairly good.It is a good review of greed and ambition.The character doesnt exactly apeal to me, as he , for an attorney, certainly didnt research his decisions, with regard to cases. The book will hold your interest and at times leave you shaking your head with disbelief.A good insight into choices and consequences."
3,Enjoyable but ultimately unfulfilling,"I think I've read all of John Grisham's novels and this one is definitely my least favorite. Like all of his books it's eminently readable - the pages keep turning, almost by themselves! But it's a pretty obvious conclusion that you see building up, the motivations of the characters were not convincing and the final pages were mostly a ""so what""?"
4,A Dramatic Rise But Oh What A Fall,"John Grisham returns to fine form in The King Of Torts. Unlike his previous novel, The Summons,The King of Torts remains consistent and captivating from start to finish.The story depicts the sudden rise and even greater fall of lawyer, Clay Carter as he dabbles in Tort Law. Its interesting to view the different changes in Carter's lifestyle and personality as his firm rakes in settlement fees as well as when Carter turns from hunter to hunted. Many characters are introduced and depicted quite accurately at an appropriate level of detail.Maybe not on the level of The Firm or The Chamber but certainly a return to form for Grisham."
2,Boring and Predictable,I read this book on holiday. The ending was completely predictable by about page 50. I was bored and struggled to finish this low grade book. NOT one of his better books!
2,thumbs down,"The other reviews can give you the necessary information about the plot. As another commentary on the plot, however, I was greatly disappointed. My husband and I both read the book and both kept hoping that there would be some redeeming plot twist. I thought, ""Surely it can't just be a tiresome repetition about the main character's increasing lust for power and money?"" But alas, it was just that. And then suddenly it just seems to end with a quick, neat, wrap-up."
2,A little disappointing Grisham book,"I am a long time fan of John Grisham, I read all of his legal thrillers and this one might be the one I least enjoyed. The story line and characters in the book is so unreal.There were so many money making opportunities for Clay Carter at the beginning and so many bad things happened to him at the end at the same time is just not real.I enjoyed Grisham's early writings, lately has been a little disappointing."
4,Great,This story definitely kept me entertained during a 2 day road trip. I couldn't wait to get back in the car!
2,disappointed,"I think Grisham has lost his edge. If this was supposed to be a thriller,comparable to his early work, it fell short. I kept thinking that any moment there would be a surprise twist or something to make it a Grisham worthy read. There is no depth to the characters, the plot was predictable and kind of boring. As others have mentioned, greedy lawyers are kind of a given in tort law, no? I am glad I borrowed this from a friend instead of purchasing it. I have really enjoyed The Firm, The Pelican Brief, Backstreet Lawyer, even the Summons and the Testament. This one - not so much."
4,Thrilling read,"This book as a whole was written excellenty. John Grisham did an excellent job keeping you on the edge of your seat. You never knew what was going to happen next. It was a good novel with an excellent plotline that the author kept up with very well. The book starts out with a great opening with tons of details and backround information. This helps keep you going and helps you understand the story and why everythingthat happens. There is a great morale in this story, and John Grishams very helpfull foreshadowing helps along the flow of the novel."
2,"""Copout""","John Grisham should stop trying to meet his publisher's demands and take some time to write a good book; I'm sure he is capable of writing something other than a ""Hollywood-type"" book (like hoping to get a screenplay bid - worse he may already have it?) I think it's time that Grisham, Patterson, et al. stop cranking out lousy books. In defense of the book, it was interesting to see how class action suits are put together. Sorry John, please go back and write a great book - I'm sure you are capable of it!"
4,I Liked it,"This is what John Grisham does best - what I call a ""lawyer book!"" The story moves along quickly and he builds tension well. Clay Carter's rise to wealth and fame is too quick and a bit unbelievable but his fall is justified and necessary.I had to laugh, though. The name Clay makes me think of American Idol finalist Clay Aiken and in my mind that is what Clay Carter looked like! If you haven't heard of Clay Aiken yet, you will. But Grisham couldn't have known this when he named his character.Otherwise I enjoyed this book and read it in two days. I learned a bit about tort law too. Ironically, I am part of a class action suit right now but the stakes are very low, probably with a settlement under $100.00 per person. So it was interesting to me at this point in time.I always look forward to the latest Grisham book and was not disappointed by this one."
1,Kings of [Fools],"We are the kings.We are the [fools]. The automated buyers of Grisham. ... This book is so predictable, so uncreative and so dull, that I wish I had spent the 4 hours on the golf course instead."
1,I finally just gave up,"Are you sure John Grisham wrote this book? It was so unlike his other books. It was so boring I started skipping pages to get to the ""good part"". Trust me - there isn't a ""good part""."
1,What was this book about???,"I have read almost all of Grisham's books and have thoroughly enjoyed them. I started King of Torts expecting to have a good read. His stories do follow a formula, but it's usually interesting: good lawyer, bad lawyers, someone running for their life, and lots of money. As usual, his engaging style kept me turning pages, but I kept wondering when the plot was going to go somewhere. I could not believe it when I finished and realized that was all there was. So many story points headed in possibly exciting directions and not one of them panned out. I would say this book was a good first half of a novel. Unfortunately, it never comes to a climax or resolution. It's like telling a joke and forgeting the punchline. I was very disappointed. Was the whole thing about the evils of rapid wealth? If so, even that point was poorly made. I can't believe this got published. I hope Grisham puts a little more into his future works."
2,Definitely NOT Grisham's Best,This definitely wasn't John Grisham's greatest novel. He touches on a bunch of different cases for Carter but I don't feel as though the novel was ever really pulled together.
2,Someting is missing,"This book has a preety good storyline but I often found myself falling asleep while reading it. It doesn't have any action or suspense like the early Grisham's books had. He just keeps getting worse with every novel. If you are interested in reading John Grisham don't read this one, read his early stuff like The Firm, The Client, or A time to Kill. Skip this one though. Clay Carter is a very believable character but he is not exciting enough, he is just a very boring character who starts out small lawyer with no real hopes or dreams. Then through a lawsuit he makes millions, gets greedy, and the he ends up bankrupt. That's what the whole novel is about."
1,Credibility,Highly improbable and not worth the effort. Begs for a sequel with a solid comeback such that the first novel makes sense.
5,Poor to rich in less time then you think,"This is a great novel, on an average public defender that likes being average, but sooon finds himself being more then just average. I really enjoyed this novel as I do every John Grisham novel. With the detail, and a smoothness I just can't explain. A must read, for anyone dreaming of a little more then normal life."
2,Disappointed again,"I have been a long time fan of John Grisham but the last few books that I've read of his, King of Torts included, have just seemed like he got tired of writing and ended it. One of the things I always liked about Grisham was his ability to come up with twists and unexpected endings that were totally unpredictable. King of Torts was very entertaining up to the last few chapters of the book but the ending was a huge letdown."
2,A TIME AND MONEY-WASTER,"Thin premise, weak plot line, poor character development, and a lousy ending. Young and gullible lawyer trades his ethics for big bucks but eventually sees the light. Boy leaves girl and goes through trials, then boy gets the same girl he didn't want in the first place. Ho-hum. Don't waste your time. It's clear to me, considering ""King of Torts"" and the boredom of his ""Skipping Christmas,"" that Grisham has written himself out. (Why didn't I give it a '1', you might ask. Because I did read it all the way through, and because I did learn something about the modern practice of class action law. Were the learnings worth my time? In my opinion, no.)"
3,Better than some but no courtroom thriller,I will always read Grisham since there may be another book as worthy as The Firm someday. But this book is not it. Granted the book is entertaining and educational about the world of tort lawyers but suspense is not an element included to make you care about the outcome or the characters involved in this novel. Check it out at the library.
2,Dull,"Grisham usually delivers quick, easy, and enjoyable reads, but this book fails to hold the reader's attention past chapter eleven. At that point, the book becomes incredibly boring and difficult to finish. Don't waste time or money on this one."
3,Could have been better!!,"This is not one of Mr Grisham's best works. The read was torture, as was the slow uninteresting plot of the work. I only wish he had taken more time with it. I told my mother that by the second chapter I lost all real interest. The main character does not have to work in this novel, unlike the rest of Grisham's books. Everything just seems to fall into his lap. Bankruptcy, which is where the book ultimatley ends, is not an exciting exit strategy for a novel."
1,Grisham Falls Flat on His Face,"I am a big Grisham fan and have read all of his books except the 2 that he wrote recently which were not lawyer based. After his first 4 books Grisham was by far my favorite author but he seems to be no longer giving a good effort.King of Torts starts out OK with some promise but the last two thirds of the book is very mediocre, predictable and did not seem to have much real thought put into it.Grisham seems to be writing just to make money and has lost his ingenious imagination. He still is a very good writer but it seems like he is going through the motions.Let's hope he rolls up his sleeves and uses his excellent mind to create some more great books in the future but King of Torts is not one of them. For me it is very mediocre to poor."
1,"Enough, already","I had promised not to buy any more Grisham books, then a friend brought me a gift. As I started reading, I had a strong desire to hit the title character. As I continued, I wanted to hit the author. Totally unrealistic, shallow to no character development, completely forseeable and criss-crossed with technical errors. And from this he makes a living!"
1,King of Torts,"I read an interview of Grisham wherein he said he did not expect all his books to be bestsellers. I suspect he was referring to the ""King of Torts."" I think he already knew this book was way below the expectations that people have when they pick up one of his books.A young, struggling lawyer is offered a way to make a lot of money. He makes a lot of money, becomes entangled in the method of which he made it, loses a lot of money and nothing happens.Characters are shallow, save your money and time. A verrrry boring book.A shame when authors take advantage of their name and ability to sell books and put out a less than adequate effort."
1,King of Torts by John Grisham,"Very disappointing product by John Grisham; characters are not well-developed, shallow. Story line too predictable. Hope to see much better from John Grisham in the future!"
3,Typical Grisham Pulp Fiction,"My wife purchased this, otherwise I would not have spent the money. All of Grisham's works are formulaic in nature, this one does not depart from his norm. All of the main characters are completely lacking in morals or ethics and are thus unsympathetic. I am surprised that lawyers don't sue Grisham for his characterization of them, but perhaps it is all too true. One true regret in life is that Grisham cranks them out regularly, while Scott Turrow takes years. This is one of the basic inequities of life."
3,Quick read,"I read many of John Grisham's novels and this one I found to be rather predictable. However, it is a very enjoyable, quick read. Perfect for a vacation read. It isn't close to his best."
1,Thw worst book by Grisham,"Truly horrible! No storyline whatsoever. Disgusting. The beginning 20 pages were ok, but the rest was not. Reading the book turned into a much-dreaded chore, instead of enjoyment. Grisham can do better."
4,A return to the 'old' Grisham novels,"After reading the King of the torts, I was struck by two outstanding feelings. One, that Grisham made a return to his comfortable writing topic and style, and two, that the excess of the dot-com era heavily influenced this unusual book.The central character seems to be the antithesis of the typical Grishim model. While the basic formula is still present in our Mr. Clay, his fatal flaw - call it arrogence, or greed - is new territory for Grisham.On numerous occassions he mention's the wash out of dot-commer's who've built and lost fortunes - a fitting analogy for our protagonist who ulitmately sow's the seeds of his own destruction.The book effectively will move you with feelings of excitment, undeserved means, and humbling defeat.All in all, this was the best Grisham novel since the runaway jury."
4,"A quick read, keeps the pace going","I don't consider myself a huge Grisham fan, but I was looking forward to this book. From page 1, it kept me going and I ended up reading the entire book in one night (though it was a late night).A lot of the characters in the book were similar to those of others in previous Grisham novels; as were the themes of greed and ethics and where it gets you.Not my favorite Grisham tale, but a good read none the less."
3,"A bit like ""The Firm""","Another standard Grisham novel, but more satisfying than his recent books. This one reminds me of ""The Firm""--a poor lawyer tempted by corrupt money; lengthy descriptions of the good life he finds once he gets to the top; the feds attempt to rain on his parade; he disappears with the girl at the end. The first case which makes our hero the ""King of Torts"" can be seen coming from a mile away, but the twist which ""dethrones"" him is a nice surpise."
1,Worst Grisham book ever...,"I'm a fan of John Grisham and I've read almost all his books.This 'King of Torts' was absolutely crap! When I finished it I actually checked and double checked the author, yes it said John Grisham...Couldn't believe it...Remi"
2,Lackluster Grisham Novel,"This was the first John Grisham novel I have read in quite a while, and I thoroughly enjoyed many of his earlier books. However, this book was pretty bland. I kept expecting something significant to happen-or at least a drastic twist in events, and that never came. The book exhausts the word ""million"", and revolves around getting insider information, and spending way too much money. Unfortunately, that is pretty much all that happens in this book."
2,Grisham - The king of the great start,"Grisham's novels always start out great, but end up leaving me vaguely dissatisfied. The King of Torts was no exception. The first half of this book is some of his best writing yet, the second half isn't even worth reading. It's as if the author just gave up half way through. I do not recommend this book."
2,A Tort-uous Trip,"A frustrated 30-year old public defender, intimidated by his girl friend's rich parents, opts to chase the big bucks offered by a shady character representing a major pharmaceutical company as a tort (class action) lawyer. Millions of dollars, yachts, a Gulfstream, a trophy model and 17 months later his bubble crashes and bankruptcy completes the circle. Grisham has an ax to grind and over 450 pages, he manages to savage the tort system. Unfortunately, the chartacters are merely pawns in forwarding his editorial trip, and the reader suffers."
1,Grisham Gave Up!,"This is by far the WORST Grisham book I've ever read (and I've read them all). Just when I think I might get a big surprise ending, I just get an ending. That's all. The plot never came full circle...characters were introduced in the beginning and played up, then never reappeared....it's as if Grisham just gave up in the middle of the book. Since I'm a devoted Grisham reader, I'll try again, but if the next one bites the dust, he won't get a third chance."
5,"Oww, my neck hurts...","...because I was just playing this album in my car and involuntarily banging my head until it nearly flew off. If you're looking for a band that plays uncompromising, unrelenting metal simply because they feel like it, you can't do any better than Napalm Death. In a grindcore genre too often defined by gross-out vocals, one-note guitars, and all-too-brief songs, Napalm have crafted a superb technical statment. Yeah, the songs on ""Words..."" are all pretty much the same, but the level of creativity and musicianship here on display more than makes up for any deficiency in the diversity department. Every song on this album boasts an absolutely crushing groove, and the mix of Barney Greenway's leather lungs and the technicality of the music is mind-blowing. There is not even one second of filler on ""Words From the Exit Wound;"" hell, it's worth checking out even if only for the title."
4,Another chapter for a band that continues to maintain a mostly steady career...,"I have to admit that when a band starts...they usually start off decent, great or terrible. Then, the band usually continues to improve/degrade the sound that they started with depending on how they started. I've heard so many bands that have started off so crappy and have made themselves respectable and I have heard bands where they started off excellent and basically made a decline. Well, I'm glad to say that Napalm Death doesn't really fall into either category. They have for the most part of their career...consistenly put out good music. This CD is just another regular Napalm Death CD and won't really change your opinion on the band too much. It just remains testament to the fact they are a good band. Infact I gave this CD a ""4"" because its just a normal Napalm Death CD...which is still better than most in the genre."
1,what happened here,"I do not know what happened to this album. This is not grindcore at all. I wish this was like scum, from enslavement or even like harmony corruption. This album is to slow but heavy but does not cut it at all."
2,Curious.......,"Mostly this is noise. It is powerful and crazy and good metal, but lacking lyrically. Napalm Death have the potential, which is why I give them an extra star. But they should improve their lyrical sound. I would like to interpet what the singer is saying. I don't mean to offend Napalm fans, but I don't prefer bands were the singing is reduced to roaring and mumbling. As for metal, I'll stick with MetallicA and Slayer hoping one day Napalm Death will improve their lyrics. They are musically heavy and good though. Thanx."
3,Not the Best,"I've owned this version since it first appeared at full price. I have never learned to love it. The cast is good, and there's nothing overtly bad about the musical choices. The problem is that it's just not interesting; this opera is funny, but you would never know it from this recording. it is staid and uninvolving in overall effect. I blame the conductor. Get a different version."
4,"Excellent, only in English and French",It was in excellent condition but it was only in English and French with no subtitles in any other language.
5,Wonderful Movie,This is a wonderful restoration of a classic movie. The clarity and sharpness of the colors is simply amazing. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoyed the movie as a child and now owns a blu-ray player.
4,"Great classic, but worth the extra money?","This movie has always been one of my favorites, but the new blue-ray version really adds an extra ""Wow"" factor. The color and clarity are enhanced for added sharpness and enjoyment. We had recieved this dvd as a gift, so I wasn't as aware of the price until I checked it out here on Amazon.Although, I really love the movie, I'm not sure that it is worth the extra money. Perhaps the economy has made me more budget conscious, but I would probably think twice about this unless you were absolutely determined to get THIS movie. In that case, you will not be disappointed. If you are trying to decide between Snow White and another movie at a lower cost, think hard."
3,Not complete.,"I love all the Disney films and this one is no exception. However, that being said, I do feel like I was stiffed in the fact that the Platinum edition had FAR more bonus features. Gone is the Silly Symphony ""Goddess of Spring"" and all the radio broadcasts, and basically anything that was on the bonus disc of the Platunum version. Notice also that Barbara Streisand's version of 'Some Day My Prince Will Come' has been replaced with the generic teen Disney star of the moment. Typical.I also feel that the prior release was better in the fact that the movie was made to fit the screen (Original Theatrical Aspect ratio) rather than the (1.33:1) ratio that it is now. I think this is done simply for the pointless DisneyView art of Tony Bluth. Granted, the picture is radiant and beautiful, but this the blu-ray format and therefore supposed to be able to hold 6 times the information of a standard DVD. So why aren't they being utilized to do so?I'll be keeping my Platinum edition."
1,Incompatible,"I found this DVD to be incompatible with my Panasonic DVD player. Disney acknowledged that they are aware of this problem, but offer no solution, other than to exchange for another title. It breaks my heart when my two year old says that she wants to watch ""Snow White,"" but cannot, because Disney created a defective product which is not compatible with all players."
1,It is in Korean! Shame on you Amazon for not pulling this listing!!,"My five year old wanted the Snow White DVD. Since Disney is not currently selling it, I referred to Amazon's list of vendors. I purchased this DVD from Bargain Media Shop through Amazon.com. Wow, was I in for a surprise when I pulled it out of the box and it was in Korean! Not only is it in Korean, but the box indicates it has an English version...well if you can read Korean you might be able to figure out how to program the English version.Additionally, this DVD got gummed up in my DVD player and ruined it."
5,Exactly What I Hoped For,"This DVD is fantastic! It has everything on it I had hoped for. I was a little concerned that the copy I purchased would not have the ""Goddess of Spring"" feature it claimed to have, and so I was delighted when it did. The person who sold it to me was very prompt about shipping the DVD and answering my e-mails. I greatly appreciate the effort put in to selling me this item. As a life-long fan of ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,"" I am very happy with this purchase. I'm sure any other ""Snow White"" fan will be too."
4,Its wonderful,"I remember seeing it on VHS when I was very young,I loved the DVD quality print of it.And now I got the DVD for my daughter.She just loves it.Now snowwhite is her favorite character.The only bad thing is that she likes it so very much that she want to see it again and again.Its been playing at our home atleast 2-3 times daily ever since we got it."
2,Disappointed,I was unhappy with the bluray if Snow White and it was missing the points for Disney rewards. It was over priced and missing parts.
2,Not really a blu-ray,"I would say this is not really a blu-ray. The disc is blu-ray, but the quality is not up to par with the other Disney classics that have been converted to blu-ray. I also noticed a similar product in actual blu-ray packaging (one in a clear blue box, like all the blu-rays). This one came in a DVD box. Oh, and it's not widescreen. I'm curious to know if the one in the actual blu-ray packaging is the same quality."
3,No 16/9 only 4/3,Everything about this blu ray box set is great but the only let down is it's only available in 4/3 which is a joke on and widescreen tvBut for the packaging and extras it's worth the money
2,This Blu-ray is a mistake ...,"Of course this Blu-ray is better than the DVD, but the PQ is not what you expect from a Blu-ray. If you give 4 or 5 stars to the PQ of Snow White, so I think ... Cars, Horton, etc., deserves how many stars ? 30 or 40 ... Of course!!!"
2,Not a true BD,The transfer is not that good. The aspect ratio is SD with bars on the sides. Total ripoff.
3,snow white,my product came to me in a timely fashion and in good condition. I have no complaints. This was a good business transaction.
3,Blue ray quality is not up to the expectation,"Here, I am not talking about the movie itself. I am talking about the picture quality of blue ray disk, which is an disappointment in my opinion. I do not see much difference between the DVD and blue ray in terms of picture quality. In fact, if any, I prefer the DVD quality. This is not what I would expect from a blue ray movie."
2,Classic Movie but Poor Choice of Packaging,"While I looked forward to this movie, I ordered the blu ray edition with standard dvd. My first copy came with a scratched standard dvd so I did an exchange. Then my second copy came with the same thing, a better but still scratched version of the standard dvd. While the scratches are not huge and the movie may still play, I paid for a limited release movie and expect my discs to come in a new flawless fashion (ie no scratches)."
2,I love the movie BUT,I love this movie and I love this version of it and how it was cleaned up but the Bonus Features are on a BLU RAY disc.For those that don't know it BLU RAY will not play on regular DVD players I consider this very unfair that I paid for this and cannot play my Bonus Features
2,Not really satisfied,"I liked this movie better when I was younger. But when I grew up, I realzed how much I disliked it, I'm sorry. A great first, but not the 'greatest Disney film ever' as other people said it was. This movie is not totally kid-friendly, this movie gives my little cousin the creeps. Snow White's voice was totally annoying, and I felt I should have brought earmuffs everytime my young best friend watches it. A scary-looking queen transforming into an even SCARIER witch? Not kid's stuff. I think the animation is also crude, but it's an old movie.Don't get me wrong, I love Disney movies but this is a movie I will not totally like. I absolutely love Bambi and all the other animal films, and the modern princess movies. I'm sorry if I sound unfair, but this movie gives me the creeps. My little cousin hides it under all the other DVDs. But I have to admit, the bonus stuff were great."
3,A Classic but Not Impressed,"Sleeping Beauty on Blu-ray was an amazing spectacle and took the movie to new levels in quality. However, Disney was not able to do the same with Snow White. Personally I do not like the movie or songs, but the visually and audio quality are not on par with Sleeping Beauty. Certainly it is an old movie, but it did not meet my expectations."
3,Not Wide-screen,"Being a ""Special Platinum Edition"", I expected this to be in widescreen format so you can get the same experience as what was shown in the theaters. This was the TV standard format, so the sides were cut off. The movie itself it good, but I would not by this DVD. I would pay a bit more and get the wide-screen version."
5,Arrived Very Quickly,"Because this was a gift for my niece, I cannot really rate it other than to say it arrived quickly."
1,Why So Expensive?,I assume this is the newly released Diamond Edition. The price is too high. And why is Amazon not selling it direct?
3,could be better,"Restoration is extraiordinaray and English language sounds great, however as on most blu-ray disnery restorations spanish sound is terrible, voices are way below expectations making all the effort on image be lost.when Walt was still alive Disney paid great attention to double on foreign languages, unfortunaetly this is not the case with current adminsitration."
4,A Disney Classic With a DVD that SOARS,"As wonderful as ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" still is - decades after its theatrical release, younger audiences may find its animation flat and uninspired. Blame DISNEY itself for that, since in the past 20 years, the studio has released equally timeless tales that far exceed this film's technical qualities. Nowhere here will you find the depth and 3-dimensional elements of ""Beauty and the Beast"" or the sheer grandeur of ""The Lion King."" And, SNow White's operatic vocal inflections can be grating at times, I admit. Still - this is pure Disney magic, sure to be enjoyed for decades to come!"
5,Throw Away Your Video Tape: Get The DVD,"DVD extras are all very well, but they are meaningless without the movie itself--and here Disney's remastered, restored, and digitalized SNOW WHITE lives up to every bit of the press it has received. Even now, some seventy years after it was first seen, this simple version of the famous Grimm fairy-tale can still cast a spell through storytelling pure and simple. And the DVD formatted film is astonishingly beautiful--brilliantly colored--incredibly clear--so beautiful that no matter how often you may have seen the film in the past you will feel that you now see it for the first time.The extras are enough to fill out a second disk and include everything from background art to timelines to trivia games. Some of it is very interesting indeed; some of it I found rather tedious. But... so what? The important thing, the thing you're actually buying the DVD for, is SNOW WHITE, right? And with this DVD release, she remains the fairest in the land."
4,Maddie's Favorite,"After watching Snow White no less than EIGHTEEN TIMES with my 20 month old I feel as if I am somewhat of an exprert. Disney has outdone themselves with this masterpiece of a film. The story is greatly known, although the message that this sends to young women may need some interference from mom and dad but ths movie is timeless in it's good vs evil themes and true love.The DVD extras are quite fun: visit Snow White through the years. Play Dopey's mine game (well this is a bit dull for adults but the little one loved it), a ""Hi-Ho"" sing along. There is also Barbra Striesand belting out ""someday My Prince Will Come"". This is a great DVD to add to your collection and one that will get much play."
3,Must be intuitive of menus,"I was happy to be able to by a DVD not a Blue-Ray. The only problem with this import was it was all in Korean including the menues. You have to use your intuitive skills of menues, since you are reading Korean or unless you know Korean, to swith the language to English and turn off the subtitles. It wasn't that dificult. We do have to do it everytime we play the disk. But movie plays well and is of good quality."
4,Perfect for a family with small children,As a mother's perspective I must say that my children were very entertained as they saw this movie. Not only once but they played it 3 times the day that it arrived. The musicals were very entertaining. The quality of the movie was really nice and crisp. Only downside for me is that I don't like my children to see witchcraft even if it is a fairy tale(when the queen is making the potion and puts it in the apple). Just my thoughts...
5,The Essence of Disney,"This is, without doubt, the crown jewel of the Disney collection. There isn't a frame in this movie that isn't gorgeous, and the storytelling is Disney at his best; truly timeless. This is an absolute must-have for any Disney fan or anyone with young children."
5,Wonderful,"Anything Disney/Pixar makes is a wonderful, enjoyable movie for the wholefamily to watch together or just alone. Quality material, great stories chosenfrom our childhood and exciting to watch again as adults. Out takes are hilarious."
5,Great Combo,"I enjoy all the extra features on here. Explaining about Walt and his history. I enjoy the feature of the art while watching the movie. I love the fact that i can lend the movie to a friend that doesn't have a blu-ray player and just incase they ""loose"" it I LOVE that I still have a Blu-Ray copy in my possession."
5,Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,What can I say? Just a real great classic for young and old. A must for your collection if you're a Walt Disney fan.
1,late and scratched,"I was very disappointed with this Amazon shopping experience. Not only did this video take weeks to arrive, and then only after contacting the seller, it was damaged. My daughter couldn't wait to see Snow White and unfortunately the scratched DVD skipped 5 minutes into the movie. I am so disappointed and upset that I spent 35 dollars for a movie we will never see!"
1,very disappointed,"The movie was billed as in excellent condition, but it gets stuck at the same point every time and is almost impossible to continue on. We always miss part of the movie when we do finally get it to play again and it takes a lot of time. I definitely wouldn't buy like this again."
1,Second try ....,This DVD purchase was a disappointment since the DVD would not play. My son informed me and I informed the sender. A second DVD would not play either and the store offered a refund. Lesson learned: DON'T BUY DVDS FROM AMAZON.COM.
1,These are now PIRATED COPIES!!,"Let me tell everyone. All of the movies that are not being made anymore are now selling as PIRATED COPIES!! You cannot get an original Lion King, Snow White, Little Mermaid, Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast.....The sellers will tell you that they are original and factory sealed. But just check for the SECURITY SEAL. It is GONE!! There is no security seal on any of these. And the ""paperwork"" is all copied. The video quality is very poor. The originals are put into ""flip page"" cases, but the copies have the DVDs on the sides of the case, facing each other.THESE ARE PIRATED COPIES AND SOME OF THESE SELLERS DON'T EVEN KNOW IT. That's what makes it harder to report them. They are genuinely nice people and didn't mean to sell a copy. They really think it's an original. So, NO, I haven't reported anyone...just letting everyone know through this review."
1,Great Movie - Blu Ray won't play on Pioneer BDP-121,"I've been reading that people have been having trouble playing the Blu Ray version on some older Blue Ray player models. It won't work on my Pioneer BDP-121, even when I updated it to the latest firmware (Version 9080400).Your 3 year old daughter isn't going to care if it's on DVD or Blu Ray or even VHS. She wants to watch Snow White and wants to watch it NOW NOW NOW. I just thank my lucky stars that the DVD version came with the package, I was able to play it without any problems.I'm giving 1 star for the non-functioning Blu-Ray disk. Eleventy million stars for the movie itself.Sooo.... skip the Blu Ray, especially if you have a Pioneer BDP-121, and stick with the tried and true DVD format.-Derrick"
5,A Classic....but a bit disturbing,"It is of course a wonderful Cinematic achievement. Beautifully done, and very true to the Grimm tale. However, it has one of the most disturbing subjects in a Children's story I have ever heard. The stepmother sending out a Huntsman to cut out her heart?!?! Then trying to poison her. And the forest scene is outright terrible. Not recommended for kids under 12, in my opinion. I was scared for a long to time to watch that after the first time. It took me 5 years to see it again after I was 8 yrs old. Otherwise, a beautiful movie with great music."
5,Snow White DVD,This DVD arrived very quickly and was in excellent condition. It was advertised as previously owned. But the only way you could tell is that there was no cellaphane around the DVD. We have really enjoyed our purchase.
2,little disappointing,"When i received the Snow White DVD in the mail, my daughter wanted to watch it right away. Unfortunately, when we tried to play it in the living room, all we got was a lot of noise from the machine and ""Disk Error"" on the screen. Needless to say I was not very happy. We tried it in the DVD player in my bedroom and it does work in there although the entire time it plays you can hear the disk inside the machine. Since I dont want to have to let my daughter in my room every time she want to watch Snow White, I will probably be buying another copy and hoping for the best."
1,Can not get it to play.,I loved Snow White and was so excited to get this movie in Blue Ray and see how great it looks and it won't play. We have done the updates and still nothing. I am very sad.
1,Disk does not work.,"We received Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs DVD and it is incompatible with our Panasonic DVD player. We've never had this problem before with any other DVD. The Snow White disk works in our computer and another player in our office, but not in the DVD player that we have at home. Consequently, we haven't been able to view the movie with our child."
1,Not Happy,"The delivery was VERY fast. We got the DVD about a week before they expected. However, it was NOT ""new"". There were no security sealings on the case which leads me to assume that it was opened. The wrapping on the case was not the original wrapping that comes on DVDs. It was a shrink wrap just like the kind we use at our college bookstore to wrap bundled textbooks. THEN, when we watched the movie, it constantly had a black box in the corner with a video camera picture in it. The box that usually comes on when you've copied from a DVD incorrectly. This was NOT a satisfying purchase. Be VERY careful when ordering this DVD."
1,Snow White Blu Ray DVD,New in the pack as advertised... Had two (2) or three glitches (I have a NEW player)I want my laser disc back !Jim in TN
2,The most annoying voice in Disney history.,"I am an avid Disney fan, but that doesn't mean I love all of them, and Snow White is one that I will never like. It is average when Snow White remains silent, but when she talks I must admit to cringing. I give it two stars for the animal characters (I always liked the turtle) and Grumpy (the rest of the Dwarfs kind of freak me out). Also another thing that annoys me is that Snow White falls in love with the Prince after meeting him for two seconds (and kissing a bird) at a well, I don't think they even exchanged one real word, Cinderella had more contact than that with her Prince and that was pretty minimal. It really is the worst of the Princess movies, which I feel is too bad because it was the first and I really wish that I could like it, but I really can't."
1,Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,"I ordered the DVD (Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs) back on September 20th. An e-mail sent to me on September 25th stating that it was to arrive between Oct. 2nd and Oct. 20th from something called ""theworkhog"". I have e-mailed them and asked where it was and to let me know when it would arrive. It is already paid for and nothing has yet to come of it. Now I want to know where it is and when am I going to receive it. I have no way to give an actual review of this as the reasons I have already stated. Now I want you to investigate this and get back to me. ""theworkhog"" seems to be a very irresponsible company and could care less about the customers they deal with. The rating is not for the product but for the company called ""theworkhog""."
4,Great quality,The digitally remastered version of this classic is great. There is such a big difference between watching this movie on DVD and then on video. I couldn't believe the clear quality. Definitely worth the purchase.
4,A classic,This is a classic and should be in any collection. The nice thing about this Three disc version is that if you don't have blu-ray yet is that you have the dvd version until you get blu-ray and have the best of both worlds.
3,Snow White (2001),I find this issue of Snow White lacking in picture quality and sound. It was released about 10 years ago. I strongly advise buying the newer more recent release of this movie. Snow White is still a classic. Happy Viewing!
1,WARNING! Foreign language - NO ENGLISH VERSION!,"Packaging and product are nice, except for the fact that there is no warning that the title is in Korean and not english. Supposedly, there's a menu offering the english language version of the film, except the menu is also in Korean. This purchase is being returned to Amazon."
3,Arrived as advertised,"This DVD arrived in good condition. The movie is not quite the same as I remembered it to be, though. Animation quality has greatly advanced since the 1950s."
5,Snow White 2009 edition,"I have loved Snow White since I was a little girl and have been looking forward to sharing this movie with my soon to be 3year old daughter. What a perfect time for this edition to come out. It is so great, the colors and details are so clear and rich, while maintaining the integrity of this classic film. I can't say enough good things about it and consider myself very lucky to have been chosen to receive a sneek peek for this movie. This is a perfect movie for the young and the young at heart. Go ahead and buy it, you won't regret. It is well worth the money, just the movie alone, but all the extras make it even better. I heartily give it two thumbs up."
5,Yay!,"I'm so thrilled they're releasing this again! I missed it when they released the platinum edition, and I am not one to want to buy used DVD's. I'll be buying this when it comes out in November."
5,Snow White - Finally on DVD!,"I cannot describe 'Snow White & The Seven Dwarfs' in words, it's a true classic with unforgettable songs and characters, and the whole family will spend hours with this double DVD edition, that includes galleries, games and much more!If you are a big Disney fan like me, buy this amazing DVD!"
2,Ahhh The Barbra Streissand song is soooo horrid,"I am not even a Barbra-hater... I kind of like her sometimes.But that version of ""someday my prince will come"" is so horrible I have to dive at the VCR to make sure I am not tortured by a single note of it.I don't think I have ever hated a song so much.The kids like it.Actually my 2 1/2 year old wont watch it because it is too ""scary"" but, I expect she'll like it someday.I think the color might have been better on this version of Snow White. That was nice, though I couldnt really tell."
5,One of disney's best films !,Get a hobby whoever said that they were the only one who hated snow white and you you head over heels you best go head over heels for this movie ! This is disney's 3rd best !Bottom line ?This is one heck of a movie !
2,Eh-So SO,"The DVD worked well, and the cover was good but it did not include the slip cover (which I really wanted). The fact that this was missing should have been included in the description."
1,Disney's DVD release policy is idiotic!!,"My rating applies to Disney's DVD policy rather than this Movie. Because of Disney's stupid limited release policy, generations of children will not be able to purchase certain DVDs. Snow White was released in 2001 and put in the ""vault"" in 2002. A child born later than 2002 will not see Snow White on DVD in a store for atleast a decade. So much for experiencing Snow White in the magical years. The nimrods who came up with this anti-consumer policy need to be put in a vault. DISNEY wake up! Release ALL the Disney classic movies on DVD and keep them in stores. If you really cared about children experiencing Disney Magic, you would dump this wrong-headed policy!!!"
5,snowwhite,i brought this video tape for my granddaughter whose's 3 years old she watches it non stop she loves all the disney princess movies and this one was so reasonable in price and it brings back memories for me also thank you for selling it and for the price
4,The princess who started it all - still looks good! :),"The over-all movie quality was superb, colors were vibrant, and the sound was clear. Happy to have this classic in my collection now (though the discs were scratchier than anticipated, everything still plays fine so far)."
4,Thanks,"Arrived in timely mannor, concerns about it being ""new"", but seller quickly responded to my concerns and took care of it. Thank you!"
4,Looks and sounds amazing - not quite as magical as I remember,"I buy every Disney classic on Blu-Ray and this was obviously no exception. Great product in all aspects, the movie just doesn't do much for me as an adult."
3,Snow White,"This was my first blue-ray purchase and it will not play on my Sharp blu-ray player. Web reviews say Disney discs take a long time to load, and others compalin about Sharp players being unreliable, so I lost out both ways.The standard DVD works fine though...and it's a classic for the kids."
4,Deliver took waayyy too long,"I was anxiously awaiting this item as my neice was to spend time with me and I wanted to have it for her.. It took over a month to get the video, and ONLY after I wrote to complain..."
4,Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs DVD,The DVD arrived before the allotted time and was in great shape. Would buy from them again.
1,A bad expereince,I bought this DVD thinking it was an original DVD but when I received the DVD it looked like a copy. I paid for an original. I contact the vendor but he was not helpful. I will not be purchasing from this vendor again.
1,disappointed,still have not seen my movies ordered them in 11/14/08fill like i have been lie to will not buy any thing from thissight again not happy at all.
3,Boring,"Kind of boring. My daughter loses interest after a few minuts as well. They could have done a better job. I don't care how many people feel this is the best DVD going, I dont' care too much for it, neither does my daughter, and it is all about the kids. She gets scared of the mirror. I can't blame her. If I was close to 5, I'd be scared too. They could have done more with this DVD, but they chose not to. I'd think twice before buying it again, but it is opened so it is obviously staying with us. Maybe when she's older she'll enjoy it. I actually fell asleep while watching it, so it's great if you need some rest."
1,Waste of time and money,"This one went right to my pile of discarded movies. I expected some decent picture quality associated with blu-ray, but was sorely disappointed. The movie itself is extremely boring and lame. Would those who raved about it please buy it back from me?"
5,Classic Disnet,This is a great classic Disney film. I've watched it many times with and without the little ones around. It's still great Disney.
5,Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (Disney Special Platinum Edition),"Pure delight to see real artistic animation. Color, artistry, classicalmusicianship, and beauty. Every child and adult must see this DisneyAcademy Award winning animation classic. Restores the beliefs ofgiving, compassion, kindness, beauty and love."
1,I got snookered!!!,"I got totally baboozled.. its all in Korean.. oh yes, you can hear it in English if you can read the Korean characters to know which to choose for English.The picture I saw did not show the Korean on the front.I am very angry I got taken... I have never had a bad experience before with Amazon."
1,False advertising!,"The language said English in the product description but it's all Asian writing on the menu. I'm going to figure out how to report this seller (if it's possible). I never had to deal with any scams when purchasing from the internet before...this is a first and I'm furious. Luckily, I found out how to get it in English without the subtitles. Choose the third cloud on the bottom of the first menu screen. Then choose the 2nd option under the first heading and finally choose the 4th option under the second heading. It will take you down to a cloud at the bottom (the left-hand side); choose this one. Good luck."
1,Snow White & The Seven Dwarfs (DVD),"I would have to say this is a total scam! It stated that the movie was in English, which is why I purchased it. Total false advertising and a waste of money. I have asked to ""return"" the product, but from what I have read, I probably am stuck with this movie. VERY disappointed. I hope Amazon recognizes this seller and will not let them use their site to sell anything further."
4,A True Classic,"This premier blu-ray version of Disney's first animated film is truly beautiful. While neither the storytelling or the soundtrack are on par with the best of Disney's classics, the prewar animation aesthetic is finally displayed for home viewing, in high definition."
5,Snei Weiss and the smurfs,An enchanting movie with lots of very cute animation. It's a bit dated by today's standards but it still holds up quite well. The colors are strong and the music good.
