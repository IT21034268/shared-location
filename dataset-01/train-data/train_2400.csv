4,"Literally, a Blast!","Most of the movie was fast moving and interesting. Not much in the way of cutsey fairy anime, mostly hardcase action movie stuff. Interesting characters and villains. I plan to watch this one over and over."
4,"Not perfect. 4 and a half stars, really","Two years after the popular tv series Cowboy Bebop finishes airing, this is released. I must say that it is not as good as the show, but has the same vibrant art, all star casting (Megumi!), and awesome character design. One thing I love about this disc is that it has interviews with the voice actors behind the English and Japanese casting. Therefore, you finally SEE Megumi! Cowboy Bebop fans, rejoice!"
3,"Satisfactory, but not as good as the series","As an avid ""Cowboy Bebop"" fan, I was quite excited to see the film. And although the film may be fantastic to those who have never viewed the entire ""Cowboy Bebop"" series, it certainly doesn't live up to the standard that the series has set. The fight scenes (especially between Spike and Electra) are certainly entertaining, but not climactic. And the ending hardly goes out with the style and pinache that the ending of ""Cowboy Bebop"" does (episodes ""The Real Folk Blues"", parts 1 and 2). Overall, I would advise someone to watch this movie, but don't expect it to blow you away like the series does. And to someone who has not seen the series, watch the movie before you partake in the ""Cowboy Bebop"" experience."
5,Everything you love about Bebop.,"If you like the series, you will like this movie. It feels more like an extended episode than a movie. Fun story, interesting new characters, and lots of Bebop quirks."
5,Classic,"This is a great movie and every Cowboy Bebop fan should own it. Cowboy Bebop ranks in my Top 5ish animes, and the movie is one of my favorites."
4,"Good, but the show is better.","I was really excited to buy this movie after I finished watching the show, and did so ASAP. I can't really say that I was disappointed per se, but the title of my review pretty much sums it up.I enjoyed the movie, and any fan of Cowboy Bebop or just of anime in general will probably do the same, but if you are new the the franchise, I'd suggest you pick up the 26 episodes in ""The Perfect Sessions"" package if you want to see some really great anime."
2,Why does great anime get ruined in the US?,"I haven't seen the dvd version of this but I have seen both the fan subbed ""Cowboy Bebop: Knockin' on Heaven's Door""(downloaded) and the US version of it ""Cowboy Bebop - The Movie""(in theaters).This is a great movie with a good story that is up to par with the show and with music to die for, if you watch the Japanese version. In the US we a get a version that has been, for lack of a better word, raped. The wonderfull bebop music has been replaced with terrible rock, totaly ruining the movie.Don't waste your time on this one."
3,cowboys and bebops,i was expecting something unique from this film with the amazing storylines from the tv show and the complex mind of spike [who is the main character on the tv show]and some even more complex storylines surronding the other characters. but that was not the case viewers. i looked forward to seeing this film because of the complex storylines one finds in japanese cartoons. but that was not the case and it looked like a plotless american action movie that just has a lot of things blow up and if you are a women or a guy who just likes stories with actual plots you know that is hard to find all and all PLEASE DON`T WASTE YOUR MONEY THIS JUNK BUY SOMETHING LIKE THE COLOR PURPLE OR SCHINDLER`S LIST WHICH IF YOU ASK ME WOULD MAKE A GOOD COMBO AND JUST IN CASE YOUR WONDERING NOT BECAUSE THERE BOTH DIRECTED BY STEVEN SPIELBERG.
2,Inappropriate,"This isn't a bad movie,but may not be a appropriate movie for little kids. Avoid this movie if you want your little children to behave. Buy Finding Nemo instead."
1,Sorry I purchased it (1.5 stars),"This film was rife with typical anime ""philosophy"" regarding the supernatural, aliens, alterna-reality. Fun stuff, right? Not here.I can't even begin to tell you what in the world this was about, since I fell asleep about a third into it, played it back, and still hadn't a clue. I felt like I wasted several hours of my life. Even the animation wasn't anything to write home about. (1987's ""Akira"" continues to blow everything else away.)Maybe if I'd seen the TV show this would all make sense. But I haven't, so there it is. For all I hear about the TV series, this film really does the entire Cowboy Bepop phenom a disservice. It just doesn't work as a stand-alone anime film.For a MUCH better story involving avenging dead (at least that what I think the baddie in CB was trying to do), rent/buy HBO's ""Spawn"" series.At least the DVD makes a good coffee coaster..."
1,Very Disapointing,"In my opinion this movie completely lost the spirit of the original series. The TV show was all about cool music, exciting action, and interesting stories. The show also had a great feeling of fun. Unfortunatly, this movie forgot to include these great aspects of the original series. I found the movie to be boring and depressing, with very little music or humor.I saw this movie in the theater on opening night with hundreds of other Bebop fans. Everybody was loud and excited about seeing the movie, but once the movie started the crowd was dead silent. It was not out of respect of the movie, though. It was because we were all so bored. I left about 20 minutes from the end... very disapointed."
5,A Rare One,"Cowboy Bebop the Movie is a rare one indeed. It's an Anime movie you can watch without knowing much about the original series. Of course, some knowledge is needed because the characters are never truly introduced the way they are in the the series. Having a Cowboy Bebop fan explain the characters in small detail before watching the film will solve this problem, though.The movie itself, with it high production value, is gorgeously animated with plenty of action. Columbia/Tristar was able to get all the original voice actors (a rare thing when a movie is published one place and the Anime series another), which was top notch in the series and is no different in the film. And the story itself, though entirely seperate from the main story in the series, is thrilling and full of surprises. The movie, as expected, follows through with an excellent soundtrack. A must see, must have for Anime fans or movie buffs."
3,Off Topic Bebop,"I have been watching the rerun over and over so many times that I believe that the whole TV series is built on one main theme that we are all living in our past. No matter how hard we try to hide from it, our past will catch up with us eventually. The present is just another dream. The movie however talks mainly about how four low lifes, or outcasts if I may say, trying to save the world instead. I find this movie kinda boring. I don't care how the world ends too much. I'd rather like to see how these people talk more about their stories instead. At least this is not a truck commerial like T3. On the other hand, the interviews are awesome. They talk about how they feel about the characters. The interviews are very touching. 2 stars for the movie. 4 stars for the interviews. 5 stars if they put the whole sound track from the TV series to the DVD."
4,Cowboy plague,"Take cowboy, add sci fi, New York and animation with a hip music back ground and you have a hit movie with nonstop action.The fatalism and dead end psychology of the villainwith a government that is everybody's enemy makes thebounty hunters the heroes without a cause.I don't think they are really trying to be funny, butas lot of the dialog and action is so old and over done thatyou find yourself laughing at the black humor of theeastern nihilism mixed with cowboy macho."
4,Anime sure to please...,"""Cowboy Bebop: The Movie"" is a fun anime feature that will please fans of the genre as well as fans of action and sci-fi. Taking place in the distant future on Mars, the film tells the story of a group of rogue ""cowboys"" looking to make an honest (or dishonest) buck. When a bioterrorist is lurking the planet, a bounty of $3 million is put on his head. Our heroes, led by Spike, race to collect the money. It's fast, funny, and very enjoyable with rich animation and interesting characters. Overall a very fun pick."
3,"Disappointing Film, Excellent DVD","The Cowboy Bebop film is an OK movie, but it's overly long and feels stretched out. The film could have been condensed by about a half an hour without really losing anything. Worse, the film shifts Ed and Jet into the background, despite the added running time of the film vs. an episode of the series that should ahve allowed all chracters to get ample screen time.Personally, I was alos deeply disappointed that the creators chose to tell a planet-bound story when provided with the broader canvas of film instead of space epic (or at least a hybrid story). I cannot emphasize enough how maddening the slow pace of the film is; there's a leisurely pace and then there's the glacial pace of this film. while the feature is medicore at best, the extras on the disc are excellent, and the picture and sound are sharper and clearer than any of the TV discs.Film: 2/5Disc: 4/5"
5,For my ñoño friend,"He loves that show, so was a perfect gift for him!!!I saw him crying while he got the present, and he almost pee on himselfThat's why i think this dvd deserve 5 stars!!!Probably he is playing with his nutria with this dvd!!Anyway, nice!"
2,Technically Brilliant but without a soul,"I was really looking forward to the release of this movie. I was a big fan of the show and when I heard that the movie was essentially a longer TV episode that actually appealed to me. Unfortunately, during the hiatus between the end of the show and the production of the movie, the team forgot what made the show good. The characters seem to be only shadows of their former selves, the plot is not developed and events happen for reasons that are not explained (For example: just why is a character involved in a dogfight with the military for example? The script gave no explanation why this character would be considered an enemy). Essentially it is more interested in looking good than BEING good. I've learned that when it comes to sequels or new productions of an old show in anime, you can't go home again."
2,Bebop - underwhelming,"After renting this (I was so glad I didn't buy it) I thought: ""Nan-dai?!"" This movie smelled like a bloated episode, and the ending of an invincible villain who finally became ""vincible"" was way too slick for me. Yeah, it had an assortment of characters, but they didn't relate to each other, and they all seemed to be ""free agents"" out to make a quick buck. It just seemed determined to mix as many themes as possible: Middle Eastern; Western; babes; Blade Runner; etc. Barf, barf,Give me Fifth Element any day."
2,Adams Fell (short of my expectations),"Adams Fall by Sean Desmond has a great concept, but the execution of it falls by the waistside. I wasn't impressed by this new author's writing style or story development. I didn't care about any of the characters, and the story seemed pretty rudimentary, like back in Creative Writing 101. And the story -- supposedly scary -- didn't send any chills down my spine. Sorry..."
1,Why does Sean Desmond hate Adams House so much?,"I eagerly awaited the receipt of this book because, like the author, I lived in Adams House - in B entry, in fact, where this book takes place. What fun, I thought, to read a book set where I had had so many adventures. Alas, no fun, just disappointment - and, quite honestly, embarassment for the author. He must be ashamed of such an excruciatingly awful book. Just terrible. And not just badly written - which it is - but such an absurbd depiction of a Harvard that just does not exist. Makes me wonder why he hates Adams House so much."
2,An underwhelming effort,I was deeply disappointed by this book. The entries on individual stories don't provide basic bibliographical information about first publication or subsequent appearances. Entries consist of facile plot summaries with next to nothing by way of critical insight or biographical context. I'm astounded such a feeble work was even published. The work of S. T. Joshi on Bierce is far more substantial on both bibliographical and biographical issues. The only use for such a book as this is if you can't remember in which story a particular character appears.
5,Cute Cute Cute!,"This toy is adorable. My son is 18 months old and rarely spends more than a few minutes at a time with any one toy; nothing seems to hold his interest. However, he got this toy yesterday afternoon and has played with it nonstop when he's been awake. It plays Old Macdonald and has 4 figures, 3 of which are animals. The pig, duck and cow all make their respective sounds and Old Macdonald talks. He loves this and so do I. Seems very sturdy thus far."
4,"What can I say, it is a holder. They do not fall out.","What can I say, it is a holder. They do not fall out. What can I say, it is a holder. They do not fall out."
1,Coins do not fit,"The coins do not fit , the hole is too small. Went to a coin shop and bought a book and the quality was much better for the same price."
2,They worked until I got arthritis,"I have used Whitman coin folders (pennies through quarters) for many years since I was a child introduced to the hobby by a shopkeeper. She had arthritis in her hands and I would insert the coins for her. This was in the 1940s. I started my own collection which was later lost in a move cross country. A few years ago, I started again, but now I find I cannot secure the coins properly and they fall out. I have tried various tools without much success. This makes me sad, as the folders are convenient and inexpensive and take up a relatively small space. Now I must find another method."
4,Merry Christmas,"I saw Regis sing Marshmallow World with Craig Ferguson on the Late Late Show on CBS and decided then to get the album. (even though Craig is not actually on this album) It's one of my favorite songs though apparently less well known to just about everyone I mentioned it to! In any case the album has a nice nostalgic feel to it and the selection of songs included are nice sing-along and feel-good Christmas music. Regis' voice is just okay but comfortable to join in with, and Joy's voice is beautiful. I love the album. (Here's hoping Craig puts out one of his own next year instead of just singing with all his guests: Reege, RZA, Brian McKnight et al!!!)"
2,Sheer Delight For Ultimate Christmas Cheeze!,"""Did you know that before he became a famous television icon that Regis Philbin had a nightclub act?"" -So states an Amazon Editorial. No Shidding Sherlock!? Yes, Regis Philbin is a professional singer and made something of a living doing so. However, this is such saccharine dribble, you will either find yourself in a sugar-induced coma or in a ceramic bowl emptying the contents of your stomach. The second 'star' for this review is for pure unashamed audacity for putting out a Christmas album of homely standards and then being surprised that he did such a deed. Yes, there is a Santa Claus in Regis's world and its scarier than a charred reindeer stuck in your chimney on Christmas morning. Merry Christmas, Satan Claus."
2,WAS a nightclub performer...,"I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT PEOPLE WHO CARE ABOUT REGIS, AND HIS IMAGE, WOULD ALLOW THIS CD TO BE RELEASED (OR EVEN MADE!)HIS VOICE ISN'T TRAINED, OR ELSE IT FORGOT; HE CAN'T CARRY A TUNE!I LIKE REGIS, BUT LIKE ALL OF US, HE HAS HIS LIMITATIONS! HELLO, HOW ABOUT A REALITY CHECK? THE POOR GUY NEEDS TO KEEP HIS TUNES IN THE SHOWER!"
1,Horrible...,"Don't waste your money, time or ears on this one. A pretty good talk show host, but he can't sing. Go back to millionaire Reg.. your singin' just don't cut it!"
1,A JOKE!,"If he can sing, I'm a brain surgeon! This whole album is a joke and a complete insult to some of the Christmas classics! One reviewer claims this is a Dean Martin laid back style. It's more like Dean Martin laid out! If you but this album, I have prime property in the Florida Everglades for you!!!!!"
1,I don't believe it,"I have heard better music from drunks on the street corner at Christmas time. he should have teamed up with Diana Krall, which would have improved it a little. not much but enough.it would make a nice background disc if you could remove his vocals."
3,Cheesey,"I really like Regis Philbin, but have to admit that this album is pretty cheesey. Not terrible, but not as good as I expected. Had the feel of a lounge act -- I was expecting more. His wife Joy, however, has a wonderful voice and should do a holiday album on her own!"
1,What kind of krap is this?,Ok.. hang it up. I had to listen to your freaking promo during your show a few years ago every day. You suck!
1,Regis-Please stick to TV!,AccuHolidays Please take this off!Regis has to be one of the worst vocalists I have ever heard in my life who has produced a for sale recording.
1,what????,"Listen to the sample tracks. Nice guy but, he can't sing. With so many Christmas CDs to choose from I can't see why anyone would pick this one."
1,"Man, I really do love Christmas music, and Regis, but ....","You need to stick to talking, Reej.This just don't get it. Nat King Cole, you ain't."
3,"Connects with some readers, misses the mark with others","Some readers will marvel at the ""mind control"" endured by the writer - others may be mildly annoyed at her utter naivete. The long, hand-wringing letters reprinted in the book are a case in point. While the book is highly personal and may not appeal to everyone, reading the psychological processes of its narrator as they are described can be an enveloping experience."
5,Former Cult Member's Perspective...,"I waited for the arrival of this book with great anticipation, because I am also a former member of the cult that the author belonged to. I was amazed at how perceptive Patti is, and how much we have in common. She is able to eloquently verbalize the mind control and abuse perpetrated by this particular cult. She shows all the emotions that I, myself, have dealt with since leaving the cult. This book would be helpful to any person who has gotten sucked into a cult, but is especially therapeutic to those who are recovering from the Worldwide Church of God. She is able to explain all the painful feelings and emotions she has experienced, but also leaves the reader with the knowledge that leaving the cult means beginning the rest of your life - with hope, and at peace with yourself. Thank you, Patti!"
4,Promise to Mellita,"I really enjoyed this exciting novel about a young medic in World War II. It drew me in from the very first page! I couldn't wait to find out what was going to happen to Nick next. It has something for everyone...War, suspense, romance all rolled into one. A real page turner. You'll like it!"
3,Good information marred by PC deviancy,"Direct and to the point. Overall a very helpful book. The only thing that grates on the nerves is the grammatically awkward use of some random ""she."" The author apparently never learned that the general pronoun is masculine. This constantly distracts and jars the reader. I can only guess this was done on purpose, though I have no clue why. Maybe because Lucke is another politically correct marxist. ""I'm a girl so, like, I guess I will write 'she' 90% of the time."" As if her gender and proper English are somehow connected, and she must justify her gender by reminding us of it at every turn.Sadly, this isn't the only book rendered half-useless by liberal loons.If you get this book in your hands, you must painstakingly white-out every bumbling ""she"" and ""her"" reference and replace it with a hand-written, proper masculine noun, in order to read this book without being jolted every few minutes."
4,Good Quick Reference Guide,"Schaum's guide is a good quick reference guide in the same sense a good gourmet cookbook may serve as a quick reference guide for getting a creative meal started. It is helpful in recalling key incredients and in just what portions and in what order they should be presented but as far as a guide to inspire, I must report this guide is NOT! Sadly, what is needed is a chapter entitled, ""Ideas!!! And how to put form to them.""I like the book and it is a good quick reference guide and it is well worth the money. In many ways it's format is just right and it can be helpful just don't expect it to prepare you to be the next Hemmingway!"
4,Short Story Telling made Simple,"Writing Great Short Stories is an interesting, instructive, and educational read.American's from age 8 to adult can benefit from Schaums Quick Guide to develop their own work."
4,Good deal,The book arrived pretty promptly from Amazon. It was exactly what I expected it to be --full of good writing advice.
4,bought it for class,"bought it for class. Basic book. Good things to learn though. If you're into writing, you might pick up a thing or two."
5,Moves your heart and mind,"Stuart is an amazing individual; a Renaissance man. His many God-given gifts come together in this album - it makes your heart fill with new hope and moves you to sing along with him to the powerfully-rich yet simple lyrics that can be appreciated by people in all walks of life. As Stu voices it, your imagination materializes the eagle soaring above against the azure sky. I have had this album for more than a year and find myself returning to it over and over again to be inspired, smiling and flying off to join Stu on his rock n roll journey towards Flight Level Heaven."
5,Leveling Off,"I've been following Stu's career and Flight Level Heaven for a few years now, and this is the best offering yet. The message has always been good, but the music is maturing like good red wine...it has depth and soul.This CD is definitely worth a listen, and you'll find yourself humming the tunes long after the music has ended. It's music you can get comfortable with. My faves are the acoustic tunes, which I find to be the most honest, but the electric stuff has guts, too. I'd say that this CD is flying high, but I think that's a bad thing...aeronautically speaking, that is, so I guess it's better to say that, with this CD, Stuart is leveling off and coming into his best musically."
5,the best wine/champagne stopper around,"I work in the wine industry and am always looking for a sealer that keeps champagne and other sparkling wines sealed completely. This is the best; stays tight enough, even when I'm driving around all day and my wine is riding in my trunk. I have used it with about every bottle - red, white, etc."
4,Useful and highly recommended,About 8 months ago I bought one of these and have been using it constantly since then. Since that time its performed faithfully and essentially it does what it advertises. It seals bottles to the extent that the soda remains fizzy over extended periods of time. Highly recommended.
2,"Worked well but broke after a few uses, totally useless now","I purchased this item in late March & it broke first week of May. On the opened bottles of wine I've used it on it worked well, but the life of it is questionable. Maybe it was just a bad one, but it's completely useless now. Probably not going to purchase the same brand again."
3,Champagne stopper,"I bought this same exact stopper at Bed, Bath & Beyond (not through Amazon). I worked great for about 1 year, then left it on a bottle of champagne for several months only to open the fridge and find it broken. It would no longer seal/tighten inside any bottle of champagne. In short, works well for a while, but eventually you will have to buy a new one."
2,great while they last,"as other reviewers here have written, this is a great wine stopper. however, you absolutely cannot tighten it too much otherwise it will just snap. and snap it will more likely than not, even if you're careful, hence 2 stars."
1,A Swindle and a Complete WASTE of Money,"1 star is too high - this should be a ZERO star rating.I used this product exactly one time before it broke. It made a good seal on a two-liter plastic bottle, but when it opened, it would no longer seal anything. No excessive force was applied - this is a flimsy, cheaply made, utterly worthless piece of junk. To put it in perspective, it cost 6 times as much as the price of the one bottle it sealed before it broke.I have had other Rabbit products, the signature opener, and the foil cutter, and both worked fine. But this bottle sealer is such a piece of junk that I wonder how it ever got to use this brand name. Just look at the number of other 1-star reviews.Do NOT waste your money - do NOT buy this - it is worthless trash."
1,Failed after the first use,"The title says it all. I used it once on a bottle of beer, and when I tried to put it back on, I rotated the top and nothing happened at all. Waste of $8."
1,a real piece of junk,"I can't believe people would give this piece of junk four and five stars. I bought two of these at bevmo and both only worked for a few minutes. They now don't seal and I can't tell what the he11 the deal is. I can't tell what came off, or broke off. I came to amazon.com to buy a replacement for these two pieces of plastic junk and fell over when I saw this with 4 and 5 stars. I agree with that other poster, we must lobby Amazon to offer a zero star rating. Did I mention that this is a piece of JUNK? 0 STARSI can relate to one poster's comments. I usually drink the whole bottle. But now that I am off booze for awhile, people I pour for, don't finish the whole bottle. Will be glad when I can finish the bottle again"
1,Metrokane velvet champagne & wine sealer,"Now here's a case of use once and throw away. It went on the bottle like a charm. It came off great. Now it's broken. It won't work at all. So, I bought a vacuvin. That's the way to go."
5,Best choice to keep wine fresh,"I have been using this particular sealer for years. Always keeps my wine fresh ... Just short of $9 seems a little high, but it's really not. The quality is substantial. It really will extend the life of your wine -- so you'll get your money back using it for just your first few bottles of wine. These things really work to keep the wine from turning. Unless you can drink an entire bottle of wine in one sitting, it pays to have one of these great wine sealers. My favorite sealer of all time."
4,Great gift for someone who has everything,"My MIL always serves champagne and it always goes to waste. She is the type of person who has everything. This was a great gift for her this year she opened it and used it immediately on Christmas Day. Who would have thought such a little inexpenisive gadget would make someone so happy. I added some rabbit stoppers, champagne flutes, and a nice bottle of champagne to a basket and Voile'... instant gift basket. Apparently these must really work because she was surprised on New Year's when she re-opened the same bottle from Christmas and it still has bubbles. GOOD PRODUCT"
2,Don't over-tighten!,"I was very hopeful about this product, having read so many positive reviews. The first day I tried it on a bottle of sparkling water. It was easy to use and when I opened the bottle the next day, the water was completely sparkling still, more than it ever has been with just the regular cap on it, so I was very excited about it and ready to order several for friends. But then I sealed it back up and it broke. I don't know if I over-screwed it, but I thought it should be turned as far as it would go until it stops. I may have gone too far, because it broke immediately. Given the good reviews here, I'm considering ordering another one and trying again, being more careful not to over-tighten it."
1,Does not work well with champagne,I purchased this specifically to extend the drinking time for champagne. Luckily the first bottle I used was fairly inexpensive. After 24 hrs there was barely any fizz left. I guess I will keep looking for a viable solution.
1,Not durable,Bought a set of two. They lasted two months before the mechanismwent bad and no longer sealed the bottle.
5,Great Product!,Easy to use -- let's us enjoy our wine a little longer. This will keep the wine bottle closed airtight and allow you to store the bottom horizontally without worrying about leakage.
4,Keeps the bubbles in champagne,This is the best way I've found to keep bubbles in sparkling wines or fruit juices for 1-2 days. It's also a good sealer for all still wines.
5,metrokane sealer,This is my second sealer. We occasionally like a glass of champagne but won't drink all of it at once. This keeps the champagne fresh and bubbly for quite some time.
1,Worthless from the get go...,"What a HUGE disappointment! It looked like it would be great. There were 2 of them. I saw them demonstrated on QVC - seemed to work great. But alas, neither worked even one time. I kept thinking - hmm - looks so simple - what am I doing wrong - does it only work on certain bottles - etc. I wouldn't waste my money on this design - there are plenty of other wine bottle sealers out there that work first time and all the time."
4,"Outstanding, but be careful","This is a wonderful sealer, for wine and for 2-liter soda bottles, but be careful to not overtighten, or it will snap and become useless. I've ruined two, but am coming back for more. I'll try to have a lighter hand this time."
1,surpermarket effect,"This collection of texts by Mr. Jencks and Mr. Kropf is a post-modern piece of work: joining different ideas as they were equivalent. At the same time it looks like a way to inform about the theories and manifestoes, in fact, it is a reductive and destructive thing because the pieces of writing don't show the real ideas of the architects. The book gives the same importance to entire complex books, short comments about buildings, magazine interviews, etc. They are not equivalent, people should be more respectful with the work of the other ones, mainly when their work is to teach and to help understanding."
4,Cetainly Worth the Money,"I found this book to be a good way to prepare for the civil service test I took. It prepared me for all the questions I may encounter except for a small portion. I did, however, as I was doing the practice exams, find mistakes in the answer key. This occured only on one or two questions, but was certainly misleading. Otherwise, this is a very good preparation book. I received a raw score of 86.7 and with college credit I will have a 95. If I take the test again, I will try another preparation book."
4,You want this book,"I've taken the basic exam, and did ok. Unfortunately military points, and other factors I wont get into here, okay is not enough. This book is the exam. The methods he recommends using involving making up your own stories to help with memory (something with sex usually works for me)has its advantages, although I think he overplays it in the book. I'm not completely through it, I still have mathematics left, but at this point I must say it is worth the money. And in my humble opinion, you get what you pay for, and more. However this is just 1 of 2 books with the words ""Police Exam Prep"" in the title that I bought, I'll let you know how the other one turns out."
4,This book does live up to its guarantee...,Prior to my law enforcement exam I had knowledge that was limited to Law and Order (the series) and cops. I purchased the Norman Hall's
2,Horrible book,I bought this book because the OCSD had it recommended on their website. I took their test before so I knew what was going to be on the test. This book has nothing to do with OCSD or LASD test. Don't buy it.
4,Good,I've started using the book but haven't gotten too far into it because of other schoolwork that needs to be done but so far it's been very helpful.
3,N. Hall's Police prep book,"Some of what is in this book is still being used today ( 50% )in the police exams in Ohio. I was looking for more personality test help and this didn't have anything like that in it. Its not a bad book, just a bit out-dated."
2,"if you don't have these, it's good; but for aficionados, what?","it doesn't matter if you think he's holy. for anyone to release an album that's predominantly older, readily available material is a milking of the fan base. it's especially disappointing when it's an artist who appears to have such a deep well to draw from. why not risk a new album of wordless material? unless this is your first exposure to cockburn's brilliance, it must be said: no matter how wonderful the pieces are, this is a money-grab by the artist."
5,Wow speechless is right,"I jus recently saw Bruce perform on October 30th and he did a few songs off of this album and I was just blown away. The way he puts the sounds together and how comfortable he is on the acoustic is just amazing. Ya there are some songs off of old albums but who could really get enough of Bruce. It's such a great album and even better watching it live so if you get a chance I would HIGHLY recommend it. And the album is not called speechless for the purpose of thats how its going to leave you (which it does anyway) but rather speechless cause theres no spoken words on the entire cd, however the music speaks for itself. Beautiful album one of my favs off it would have to be ""Rouler Sa Bosse"" but everything else is great too. No Cockburn collection could be complete without this so lets thank Bruce for realeasing this one."
4,A very good performance of Dvorak's eighth symphony,"Otmar Suitner is one conductor that is consistently underrated in English-speaking countries. However, he is a very well-known commodity in Japan as he served as an honorable guest conductor of NHK symphony orchestra for many years. Steeped in the austro-German performing tradition as deciple of Clemens Krauss, his conducting style is one of unfussy stylishness and incandescence somewhat reminiscent of Carl Schuricht.The Mozart symphony cycle that he recorded back in the 60s is a memorable example of his excellence as performing artist. This performance of Dovrak's eighth symphony is another. Suitner's tempos are on a brisk side throughout but not at the expense of flow and sinew. He brings the work to a rousing conclusion in the manner of Kubelic. The only downside is that the strings sound somewhat scrawny while the total playing time is a bit niggardly."
4,"Starrcade is WCW's ""Wrestlemania!""","WCW has always tried to build Starrcade as the biggest event of the year. When Vince Russo threw his twist into the mix, the result was surprising. It was sad to see so many of the matches end in a screwjob of sorts, but it was a true breath of fresh air to see Benoit face Jeff Jarrett in a ladder match for the WCW United States Championship. That was probably the highlight of the evening, although some of the other matches were good too.Kevin Nash vs. Sid Vicious in a powerbomb match was definitely a good match, which ended creatively, if that would be the way to put it.The main event was probably what many would consider a dream match: Goldberg vs. Bret Hart in a no DQ match. Both men are probably the most deserving wrestlers at the top of WCW's card, so it was good to see a match of Wrestlemania proportions. This is the match where Hart got kicked in the head so hard, he was out of the game for months."
2,Russo's creative overkill kills WCW's wrestlemania,"This event contained no less than 13 matches. 5 too many for a three hour show. Still, some of them are worth watching, the Marmalukes vs Lash Leroux is a decent opener, Norman Smiley's match against Meng was entertaining (in a comical sense), Chris Benoit and Jeff Jarrett in a ladder match is an absolute classic and Bret Hart and 'two move' Goldberg have a decent bout until the 'double cross' finish. Unfortunately, the 1997 Survivor Series rehash is not the only dodgy screw-job on the show. Starrcade is stuffed with them. Take my advice, leave this one well alone."
2,Starrcade 1999 - dissapointing,I really can't understand the positive feedback for this event. Without the ladder match this would be one of the biggest rip off events ever. The entire card is filled with poor finishes to matches and the main event is so poor in quality and the finish was the first nail in wCw's coffin in my opinion.
2,Panasonic Answer Machine,"Because of the impossibility of muting the ringer on the base, I was unable to use this phone/answerer in my psychotherapy office. It's an okay machine otherwise, but the absence of this feature (even in more expensive Panasonic answerers) limits its utility."
2,Panasonic KXTG6051M 5.8 GHz3 Expandable Digital Cordless Phone System,"Well, frankly, the reason I gave it only two stars was the fact that when I am talking on this phone there is static noise.Also, I cannot ""disable"" the speaker phone which announces my calls. Unfortunately, this phone is located in my kitchen and when it does announce the calls it can be heard throughout the whole condominium complex and I do have some very ""nosy"" neighbors, so it's announcing to everyone who isn't completely deaf!It's cheaply made, as is everything these days, but what can you do?Elissa Donlan"
2,Reconsider This...,"I own (and still have) the previous generation of these cordless phone. The 2.4 GHz model lasted more than 4 years, and would still be in use if it didn't broadcast on the same frequency as my wireless router. I purchased this phone without any hesitation based on the performance of the 2.4 GHz phone, and other Panasonic products I have purchased. This brand is definitely a ""go to"" brand for me, because the quality is usually superior.Unfortunately, this phone does not live up to standards. I've replaced it twice due to battery issues with the handset, once while it was under warranty from Panasonic, and then one under the store's extended warranty. At this point, with the warranty expired, I plan to simply purchase a new phone. Its not likely that I will purchase a Panasonic phone again due to the issues with this model."
4,Good product,"Easy to set up. Only had this product a few weeks but no problems so far. Can't hear the recording through the speaker so makes screening calls more difficult but haven't taken time to read manual to see if this is a programmable feature. Even so, the default setting should not have the recording silent."
4,Uniquely pretty. Now about the packaging...,"These earrings appeared well made and delightfully detailed. My wife receives many comments and compliments about them. So why not a fifth star? The box they arrived in made them look like a dollar store purchase. Though the box usually gets thrown away, these are worth a better initial presentation. A minor complaint really. Certainly worth the $$$.Consider buying the cat pin as well. You won't be disappointed!"
2,A great primer for young kids.,I bought this book because I have a problem with psychic attacks from a relative. This book has some interesting information about some of the elementals but it really didn't do me much good. If I had the book when I was 12 it would have been a excellent stepping stone for a beginner. But for a beginner up to his neck and way behind I thought that the book was mind fluff. I'm not sure if these elementals even have that much intellegence and I'm thinking that they are more of a tool for humans to express themselves. Stare at a pic of an elf. After a while it will speak for you or it will speak for someone else. That's my experience. But I'm new at magic and only a longtime victim of it. I will save this book for my children and then my wife will teach them more. My name is Zuruck.
3,"Interesting, but only in an average sort of way.","I find it interesting to read old comic stories of the past. Unfortunitaly many of the short sci-fi stories of the 40s, 50s, and 60s that are presented in this volume are just a little to dull for my tastes.This collection was by no means bad, it's just that I found most of the stories collected here to be bland or semi-interesting.Interesting for sentimental reasons would be a perfect way for me to put it.I'll rate it 3 stars out of 5. Based on the Amazon rating system this falls below the mandatory 4 star level that makes a book a worthwile read.Unless you have a strong need to revisit past comics of the 40s, 50s, and 60s, then I would suggest you skip this book."
3,Nevermore,"Every winter on the birthday of Edgar Allan Poe, a mysterious cloaked figure pays a visit to the renowned author's gravesite, bearing gifts of three roses and and half bottle of cognac. PI Tess Monahan is amonst the onlookers at this annual pilgrimage, when two caped visitors approach the gravesite... a shot rings out and one figure falls to the ground while the other escapes. When Tess recieves a visit from a strange, round ,little man who wants her to locate some mysterious missing goods connected with Poe, she and her boyfriend Crow become involved in a case of murder, theft, stalking and obbsessive collecting, all of which revolves around the life of Poe. I didn't really care all that much for this book, as I found it to be very muddled and rather difficult to follow. I've loved the previous books featuring Tess and Co., so hope that the next one is more appealing."
4,Very entertaining,As always Laura Lippman meets expectations with another very entertaining novel. The plot is creative and you are involved from the very beginning.
3,I Wish I Could Give It More Stars......,"After long awaiting Laura Lippman's next book in the Tess series, I was slightly disappointed with IN A STRANGE CITY. Although it revolves around one of the most unusual customs in Baltimore, The Poe Toaster, I just could not stay interested. The book jumped around a lot and I thought it rather confusing at times. As always, I enjoyed Tess and Crow and their trials and tribulations through the streets of Baltimore and surrounding neighborhoods. I am looking forward to this fall and the next Tess book"
3,"Works, but wish it was more sensitive","It works, but when it's not completely in the sun it will turn on. At dusk I'd prefer it would stay off until it got a little darker out."
1,Don't Buy This Plan!,"I had the opportunity to buy this plan for an Audiovox portable DVD player. I don't usually buy extended warranty/service plans but since the portable DVD players are somewhat still new I decided that for $19.99 it was a good deal. Was I ever wrong. When my DVD player went belly up in less than 6 months, I called NEW and they told me I paid Amazon too much for the plan and that it would not cover the repair or replacement. Did I hear that correctly? Yes, I PAID TOO MUCH, and now they won't honor my plan! I went back a second time and they agreed to override the price I paid but I have never heard back from them since. So I have gone back to Amazon for resolution and in the meantime bought another DVD player, got the local retailer to double the warranty, and now will have to fight with amazon to get my money back for the plan and the DVD player that does not work."
1,CHEAP MADE GARBAGE,"This would make the list of worst movies ever made in history ,it looked like it was made with a 1985 home video camera!"
1,By very far.....,"The worse movie that I have ever seen. How can someone can give this crap a four or five stars rating ?? A real mystery !Really stupid movie, poor acting, five girls screaming and crying for an hour and a half. Honestly, I can make a better movie that this and I am sure everybody can do it also...."
1,Amazingly Horrible,I purchased this movie for less than $2 and am still upset about wasting my money. If you have the option of watching this movie or running your fingernails across a chalk board while chewing on aluminum foil...Go find a chalk board; it will at least be over with quicker. I can only assume that the folks that have rated this higher than one star are out for revenge...
1,an hour & a half of my life I can never get back,"Nonsense, this is the LEAST original piece of (dare I say) film-making I have ever had the misfortune to witness. I love Blair Witch and other films that have recently shaken up the horror genre, I'm all for that, I also hate pointless big budget re-makes and sequels like Halloween, (I mean if it aint broke etc) Hostel II & subsequent Saw II to V but this film has no place on dvd shelves, no merits whatsoever. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. I saw a 5 minute clip of someone driving down clinton road in new jersey in broad daylight and it was scarier than this piece of garbage, I cant believe it cost me a star to post this UGH..........................aaaaaaaand relaaaaaaax"
1,You'd need five across the face to stay awake for this,"Look promising, but failed horribly!!!! A killer that killed several before these girls! Lots of gunfire and not one death of the main characters!!!!!!!!!!! Pass on this film!!!! I'm a horror film fanatic and this movie just did not cut it at all!!! Good plot, bad writers, bad actors. Included scenes that made you go ""What is going on?"" ""What is she doing?"" and ""Why am I watching this still?""."
3,good introduction to greek mythology,"I think this is a good starting book to engage people, like myself that are just beginning to get interested in mythology. Obviously some stories are severely shortened in order to include many stories, but this was a good read and movtivated me to go further--I am re-reading the Power of Myth by Joseph Campbell now."
2,Cognitive Deadend,"I would like to thank professor Taylor for the minor but real achievement of this book -- helping me come to an understanding of what a dead end the philosophy of language has become since Tarski's day.A century ago, the ""meaning of truth"" was a hot subject of debate, and the disputants were such titans as William James, Bertrand Russell, and Josiah Royce. The question was not one of ""philosophical semantics"" for them, it was about the precondition of knowledge.The problem is not the trivial one about which philosophers now obsess. We can all agree that if snow is white, then the statement ""snow is white"" is true. The question for the old-style philosopher was what kind of connection between my mind and snow is presumed in the very possibility that I may truly call it white."
3,Graphic SF Reader,"Batman has a problem when he discovers that several alien eggs are still surviving.He comes across a researcher who carried a queen alien, and she has been using dna samples from inmates at Arkham to breed herself squad of superhuman soldiers that can deal with metahumans.Alien/insane villains are not very nice. Batman gets burned, fire, acid, whatever, he cops it."
5,Best CD in my collection,"Well, it is. Nearly 3 hours of my very favourite music, perfectly played. Almost perfectly, the brass at the end of the 7th are disgustingly heavy. But Accardo's concerto is the 2nd best of the millions I've heard (can't match Joshua Bell/LAPO for incredible excitement). RECOMMEND THIS CD MOST HIGHLY!"
2,Hype and reality,"I recently bought the Sibelius Volumes 1 and 2 in 2-in-1 sets. I wont comment on the artistic content as they are covered in others reviews of this page. The sound quality of Vol 2 is decidedly degraded - almost unlistenable - compared to the much much higher quality of Volume 1 (with magnificient artistry). The transfers are AAD on the Phillips label which, like DGG, of the 1970's are not meant for better quality music systems (even of that period) and unless remastered disappoint the listener. It is possible that reissues for this particular packaging could be faulty or may be that the repackaging is so cleverly done that all the goodies are on Volume 1 and the second-best on the second. Davis is redoing the Sibelius Synphonies with LSO and that may account for the rush to get this set out of the way!"
4,A forgotten jewel,"This a an unusual production among Tchaicovsky's operatic work. Lightful, full of symbolic lyricism, the pure melodies used thorough the play captivate any listener, along with the moving story.This version isn't ideal just for one point (not minor): Gorchakova's voice is too dark and heavy for the part. Thus said, let's move on: Grigoriam is moving, passionate... just wonderful. All the rest of the singers are perfect. Gergiev misses some details in the score; but all put together, he is a fine conductor. Tchaicovsky's rare beautyful gem is worth to get this set."
3,Fun Stuff,"In the tradition of Durante, Armstrong, Herb Alpert and Diana Krall (lets not forget Dr. John), and the lot of singers with no range but still make things work, Tyrell delivers a fun outing of ""Classic"" Disney tunes that we've all heard a gazillion times, but never get completely tired of (probably because they're tied to a lot of fond memories). Nice background stuff, or like another reviewer mentioned, when taxiing the grandkids."
4,Great office workhorse!,"We replaced another HP printer with this one. Very fast output, great color, and the automatic two sided printing is a terrific feature. There was virtually no new learning curve, and we are able to get operational in minutes rather than in hours. Thanks, HP."
3,"Nah, not as good as Live After death","Anything and everything maiden gets compared with Live After death...Heck I might as well tell you right away that this one doesn't even come close...But anyways, it's maiden... so i bought it! :)And yeah... i find that the vocal level on this DVD is terribly low... I find that rather annoying."
5,Maiden Forever,"All you need to know is that it's a Maiden DVD. The rest is up to them, awsome musicians they all are. Maiden rules and everytime they come to Portugal, they how much we love to see & hear them play."
3,Where's Rock in Rio 3 DVD?,"Friends,I'm a brazilian fan of Maiden and i bought that one because it is the only one Maiden show available on DVD. The fake scenario is really bad, but it is Maiden.I went to Rock in Rio 3 show at Rio de Janeiro and it was really amazing (I don't have words to explain), and i'm waiting for the promise that the show will be available soon on DVD and CD.You have to wait and see!!!!Regards."
2,not the best Maiden video,"If you want a great live Iron Maiden video, I suggest you get Maiden England or Live After Death (if you can find it). This video, ""Raising Hell"" is a boring performance with a cheesey side show. If you're expecting a great show, just skip this one. Iron Maiden has some better videos out there."
3,Is this what you call remastered 5.1 sound ?,"Despite having a 5.1 soundtrack,the whole show can only be watched with the Dolby Stereo 2.0 mode,which leaves much to be desired.The so-called remastered 5.1 sound is TERRIBLE.Bruce's vocal is partially submerged by the cranking guitars.It's advisable to use it only if you want to start watching the second half of the show,i.e.,from track 10 (The Number of the Beast) onwards as it gets normal here.Regardless of the remastering defect,this release is still worth watching only if you are a MAIDEN fan."
1,Don't be disappointed..Avoid this DVD &wait for the new one,"As a huge Maiden fan, I was extremely disappointed w/this release. The 5.1 sound didn't even function properly and the overall sound was poor. Second, whenever the concert energy was building they would cut to the lame illusionist who was boring. Third, I've seen Maiden live 2 times and you can see that Bruce isn't even into the show. Avoid this disc and wait for the one being recorded in January."
3,Its Maiden so its good,"I liked the bands performance, but the magician did not live up to expectations. Thought his magic would be much better than what was on the dvd."
3,A Good Show,"I too am a big fan of Maiden from the early days (Iron Maiden and Killers are my favorites). However, I rated this DVD from a neutral perspective. I thought the concert part of this video was truly outstanding (and agree with what many reviewers have said about the quality of the show), but I took off 1 star for Simon's magic and 1 star for the below average audio/mix quality. As with other reviewers, I had the same effect with the 5.1 setting (very low Bruce vocals) then switched to Stereo and Bruce sounded great, but the guitars virtually dissapeared.Therefore, I honestly gave this a SOLID 3 Star rating. I would have given it 4 stars if there were some way to automatically bypass ALL of Simons magic with a single setting or option from the main menu - like ""play concert only""."
1,Some decisions by Maiden simply amazes me...,"Some decisions by Maiden simply amazes me... It seems that sometimes they dont'know how ridiculous they can be. This once majestic band decided to release a show mixed with a magician presentation. Alright, I'm not against innovations... But to release a show featuring the tour when Bruce Dickinson had already decided to leave, when the atmosphere amongst the band member were not good due to that (check their official biography, RUN TO THE HILLS) is not a ver clever choice. Also, to face that guy Janick Gers is a real test of perseverance. He's the most untalented guitarist ever to front a mega band. I think he runs and runs around to disguise his lack of playing.The magic part is ludicrous, annoying, childish. this show is all cliche and no quality. Skip it and stick to LIVE AFTER DEATH, or, even better, the show at The Rainbow with Paul Di'anno."
2,"2 Starts, only because its Maiden","Being a huge Iron Maiden fan, I had to see this DVD in 5.1 format. I can't express the dissapointment in the sound. As a previous person posted, you can't hear Bruce's vocals. I anxiously changed all possible setting in my receiver in hopes that it would make a difference. No chance. It is terrible. Even the two-channel option was unacceptable. I also thought the magic and other stuff was kind of cheesy, maybe it's because I'm in my thirtys and no longer a teen. But, Maiden is about the music and nothing else. As far as the performances, I was dissapointed in that as well. Hopefully, they release another DVD of Live after Death with better results."
2,Disappointing,"The so called 5.1 is terrible. I could not hear any vocals. I had to play it on regular two channel stereo for it sound descent at all. The special effects in between songs were cheesy. The band can still jam, but the DVD was poorly mixed. I's rather just listen to one of their CDs."
3,Dissapointing,"I have been a fan since '86 (or late '85) and got my chance to see them in 2000 at MSG. Anyways, I was surprised to see what a low budget production this was. Maiden is know for over the top productions.Cool lighting, pyro,etc. I know this was a small place.They should have done Wembly, or Earls court. They could have just shown the last gig of the tour and sent off Bruce that way. Take my advice buy Live after Death cd or soon to be on Dvd?; or Maiden England. My ultimate dream(wich will never happen) Somewhere on Tour gig from Bristol! That on Dvd would be awesome!! So, buy at your own risk.Or wait till Rock N' Rio comes out.Up the Irons!!"
4,CELEBRATE IRON MAIDEN!,"This is certainly a performance to rank as a great encore,a tribute to the genius of iron maiden. As a true fan of Bruce Dickinson, I was amazed at the way he could sing so many of their anthems in a way that made them seem brand new. Only Adrian was missing. The real downside of this video was the ""magic""show, it really cheapened what was a great performance by the band. I was particularly intrigued by the performance of Jannick Gers, who I hadn't seen live previously. Although not the absolute classic lineup, this is worthy to be called a collector's item."
3,Raising Hell - Dickinson's Farewell,"While Maiden's on-stage energy has held steady, this video is evidence that the band may not be as sharp as they once were. While the musical and lyrical content still pack a lethal punch, the delivery often flirts with sloppiness and lacks the ""tightness"" that is so characteristic of the earlier tours/shows (see ""Live After Death""). For the Maiden faithfull, it is a must see; for the general fan, I suggest digging deeper into the Maiden archive."
2,Farewell show,"Yes, it was cool to see Bruce off on a good not, nonetheless, the show was average. We all know that the post-Adrian Smith Maiden lineup was just average. Bruce's last two Maiden CD's (Fear of the Dark and No Prayer For The Dying) were sub par. After seeing Maiden live, I felt that there was no need for the illusionist because their stage show was always killer. I support Maiden to the end, but I do NOT recommend this video. Buy ""Live After Death"" insteadRyan (Gavz@aol.com)"
3,"Where's ""Live after Death""?????","Dear Iron Maiden:Please do us all a favor and release ""Live After Death"" on DVD. Why would you release ""Raising Hell"" on DVD instead, which is substandard when compared to the great ""Live After Death""? I only give this 3 stars because it is at a good price and the only Iron Maiden DVD you can get right now."
3,"A little cool, a little lame","I saw Maiden a few times in the 80's, and I can honestly say that this concert is nothing like Maiden in the 80's. Adrian is terribly missed here. This Janick character just doesn't sound right and his timing is a bit off. Not to mention, he hops around like he's in Def Leppard or something. The sound absolutely sucks. I will admit though, I'm about half-way through the DVD right now, and the energy is picking up a bit. Definitely pales to any performances you may have seen in the 80's, but hey, it's Maiden on DVD. I think it's worth the money for that reason alone. It doesn't suck, it's just not nearly as good as a Maiden show can be. If anyone reading this saw Iron Maiden between 83 and 87, you'll understand what I'm saying. Also, now you can blame Maiden for those stupid Fox Magic shows. I think this is where they got the idea. Really lame decision for the Maiden boys to go with this stupid idea."
3,GOOD BUT NOT GREAT,"I consider my self as a MAIDEN fan.Though im also a very fussy listener,sure the graphics are awsome but with out Arians style its LOST his playing realy complimeted DAVEs style but on this DVD you can realy feel the pinch in the lead breaks.Other than that well i feel the other members try hard to make up for ADRIANS departure......"
2,Excitement over Maiden DVD turns to disappointment...,"I wasn't really a fan of this show even when it was on VHS - the fake studio setting just never seemed right. And the song selection is debatable, although there are some good surprises (""Transylvania"", f'rinstance). Anyway, I figured I had to get the DVD just because it would be cool to have a Maiden DVD. Not a great move, it turns out.The one positive thing I can say is that the picture quality is impressive. This thing looks cool. But then you have to listen to it, and it falls apart. Whoever did the mix should be embarassed. This was the first concert in 5.1 that I've purchased, and it about turned me off to any future purchases. Horrible, muddy sound with Bruce's vocals buried waaaayyy back. The stereo mix is fair. But why buy a DVD to have a regular stereo mix? Well, it gets two stars just because it's Iron Maiden, but this release doesn't deserve to have the Maiden name on it."
1,christina's having another identity crisis,"from puerto rican school girl to wannabe hoochie mama wishing she was ghetto to kissing madonna at the vma's what will christina do next i wonder but put out more crappy cd's with lil kim, timbaland or whoever just to get street credibility."
1,the lowest point of the pop industry,[...] She is an entertainer! The problem is: you can't stop the stupid kids for buying the celebrate pop crappy albums today. Who still recognize this maid in the next 10 years? it is the same case like britney spears and spice girls!PS: pls throw away the cd from your window or burn it to the hot ash volcanos!!!Thank god for america's future pop artists like this one!
2,Average Cut,I think Christina Aguilera has a really Good Voice but Her Material tends to leave alot to be desired overall.I like the Message of the song&the Video is cool but the song isn't strong enough to really match her range as a Artist.but the Message was there though.
3,"Good book for the beginner, but need guidence from teacher.",I had my first landscape painting class and this was the textbook for that class 30 years ago. It has good pointers for the beginner artist and puts stress on the correct value more than the color itself. The author considers that as long as you have all your values correct no matter what color you use the painting will look good.
1,...Lack of colour,"The book are only white-black illustrations, and in my opinion it is a great disadvantage. This fact I didn't know before the purchase."
5,Landscape Artist Must Have,I ordered three copies of this book for student Christmas presents this year. These three have been struggling with their landscapes and I hope they will have a better understanding with the help of this book. I have read it twice and plan a third read in the very near future. Get something new each read.
5,Teaching Aid,"As an Art Teacher for over 30 years I will now use this book as my Bible. John F. Carlson hits the nail on the head!!!!He generously covers all aspects of painting the landscape in down-to-earth language - thank you John.Wanting to know who influenced him, I am now waiting to take delivery of Birge Harrison's (1854-1929) book on Landscape Painting. And so the trail continues."
5,short list,Reading art instruction books can be tedious. How surprising it was to be glued to this one even though it lacked pretty pictures. The volume shows up on the short list of many a fine painter.
4,A classic! A bit outdated but still useful,"The book is old, but it's still popular because the advice contained given by Carlson is timeless. Unfortunately the pictures are b&w. One thing I liked is Carlson gives guidelines which help to make realistic landscapes. A teacher such as Hawthorne (highly recommend his book) would say to forget rules and just get the color right. But I find that's not easy to do. Carlson's guidelines, especially comparing values between foreground, trees, mountains, and sky are very helpful. I read his book on the beach while on vacation and I was able to see for myself a lot of the things he claims, especially about clouds. This book is so cheap there's no excuse for not reading it at least once!"
1,Text good but all in black and white - no color!,"the text is good, but it's hard to visualize a painting when it's all in dark and lite tones. Would not recommend this book even tho an artist recommened it to us.I suppose it's good for composition of your painting!"
4,"Happy with Book, but...","The wife is happy with Carlson's book, but 2 day ago, I tried to order 3 novels and after going through all the hoops of the web site, the site hung up taking the credit card info. I finally had to shut down the site."
4,Carlon's Landscape Painting,"Out of print book that is a classic. Good instruction in design, values, and common sense approach to lights and darks. Illustrations in B&W, reminiscent of its time."
3,Carlsons Guide to Landscape Painting,Printing this book in black and what did it no justice. Things would have been a great deal clearer if color was used.
3,This guide is all in black and white,"This book was raved about by other reviewers, but I am fairly new to this genre, and I didn't realize that it was all in black and white. The seller has been more than gracious in offering to take the book back, and I appreciate that. The rating is not of the seller - only of the book!"
3,"Okay, but not great","I was expecting much more from this book after reading the other reviews. The images are black and white, and I personally don't like his style. Sloppy is pretty good description of his work, and I really do admire other painters with a loose style. Maybe his focus was more on color than accurate drawing (like Monet) but if so I didn't get to see it because it was in black and white. Some of the content was moderately informative, but a lot of it was filler. The all-time greatest painting book I own is Richard Schmid's Alla Prima with beautiful color masterpieces that I want to emulate, and it has much more practical and useful information. Save your money for that one."
2,Not so pleased...,"This item came very late and for some reason, the perfume is not wrapped in plastic like the other 2 perfumes that I bought; so clearly, this is not authentic and probably very old or mixed with water and alcohol, although it indicated ""new"" on the ad, so spray it on you, give it 5 minutes, and the scent is gone! Yikes!!!"
3,A good study supplement.,"This might be enough to pass the exam, but it was not enough for me. This book covers most of what is on the exam, but not all. I found some terms that were on the exam not even mentioned. Never reply on one source for exam prep unless you are certain you will pass. Hardcover is a nice feature. I will hang on to this book though and use it as a reference."
1,"Pass on this one, folks.",Maybe a revised edition will be better. Hopefully they are going back through it right now and fixing the mistakes and making it readable and thinking things through a little better. You will lose confidence in this book quickly. Why should there be such disparity in reviews? It is no way a four or five star book. No way. I am very suspicious of those reviews. I sent my copy back and am searching for a different study guide that is better and I won't have to search long. This is a poorly and presumably hastily written book.
1,i-Net+ All-In-one Certification Exam Guide,"I must admmit that this book was:1. Boring 2. Many mistake 3. Difficult to install the program.Unfortunatelly, there is no erratta section on McGrawHill Homepage..it's a pitty !!."
2,"Buyer, Beware!","Supposedly, this book contained a CD that allowed you to access and become part of an online study group, which is the main reason I bought the book. Forget it, I had problem logging into the server, requested help from the support staff,whose web site promises superlative tech support, and haven't heard from them for over a week. Still can't access my VIRTUAL STUDY GROUP, THAT THE BOOK'S COVER PROMISES. Too late for me, I am returning this book to my local bookseller, because the content leaves alot to be desired, also. Very dry, poorly organized, nothing like the All-In- One Network + Certification book by Mike Meyers, which is the best network book I have ever read. Mike, can you write an I-Net book for the hungry minds out there?"
5,Helped me a Lot !,"I have found the book to helpful in aiding me to pass the inet+ exam. The material needed for the test was covered -- more than I wanted to know sometimes - but thorough. I agree that some of the clipart was rough, but I have no other complaints about this book. I would recommend it to my friend."
4,inet+ certification,"very good content, cover enough knowledge to pass the exam. Easily to learn by yourself"
5,A great book,"This is a great book for beginners, which I am. They really do have a passion for metal. He explains the techniques in an easy to understand manner. I really enjoyed this book."
2,A Passion For Metal,This book is more for those with a technical approach to working with metal. I loved it but some of my students found it too technical. A great resource.
2,Not a Round Trip Rather a One-Way Trip to the 1950s,"During most of the film, the main character, Nurit, doesn't smile - she hardly seems to have any personality at all. Then she meets Mushidi who moves in with Nurit and her two children as a nanny. Nurit and Mushidi become lovers and, finally, Nurit smiles. She is obviously happy with Mushidi. But then, her estranged husband finds out about the two women and threatens to take the children from Nurit. Nurit can't give up her children so she gives up Mushidi. Mushidi, in turn, turns herself into immigration and is deported. Talk about depressing! This was such a 1950s ending, and while I wasn't sure what I was expecting, a 1950s ending was no where on my horizon."
3,A maybe story,This movie had all the hallmarks to make it great but somehow fails I think. The story is ok but not great. Very superficial really and not how real life is or maybe it is for some people. As a lesbian woman I feel they miss the point and accept ordinaryness when a miracle was within their reach. Sad movie.
5,"Tel-Aviv, the Jewish state.","Yeah, this is a story about n o r m a l women-mothers providing for their kids, struggling to meet ties, as they exercised their true nature pressured with reality a world presents.A typically-traditional ending of such an ""amoral story"" is just a way producers follow for letting their works to reach a viewer, whether two females kissing or a teen playing around (Garcon Stupide).Personally, I hardly understood how an illegal migrant happened from Ghana -according to a movie info provided on this page, because a six year old son of her had been to Nigeria, but it was so arranged, perhaps, for local reasons, while highlighting a non-Muslim background of a foreigner having found as many others non-Jewish (Muslims from around a globe inclusively) a refuge in the Jewish state.A movie is the new dimension opening of Israel to me and, perhaps, to many non-Israelis."
2,Not recommended for MP3 playing,"The sound is decent, but the CD/MP3 buttons don't work as intended and even how they feel under the finger & how they sound - when pressed, makes it obvious that the unit is cheaply made. The >> and << press and hold does not fast forward normally, sometimes it automatically takes you back to the beginning/end of the track/song. It's a 50/50 chance if you'll be taken all the way back or not. Also after pressing the Stop button and then pressing Play it takes you to the beginning of the CD instead of resuming where it stopped. This may not sound like a big deal when playing a music CD, but it becomes a HUGE problem when playing an MP3 which has many hours on each CD/MP3 and often long audio-books are on them, and to find where you stopped can be very time consumming and therefore irritating. I do not recommend this unit if you are going to use it for MP3 playing."
4,decent boombox,"Decent, portable, inexpensive boombox. MP3 play is a plus. Sound quality is ok, not great."
4,Cd boombox,"This CD player seems to work fine for the purposes intended. Sound quality is good. It was for my 8 year old son, and it has been easy enough for him to use. I'm waiting to use the portable side of the player because we are taking it on vacation."
2,Didn't last as long as I would have liked,"The CD player broke about 1 year after I bought it. That is a pretty good lifespan but I hoped for better. The sound quality is not great. I just wanted something small, cheap and easy to use and that is mostly what I got."
1,Not a poster,"I was extremely disappointed in this ""poster"". It was nothing but a screenshot or something similar printed on a laser jet. It was printed on photo quality paper but otherwise there's nothing good about it. The image isn't clear and it's clearly not what I was expecting. I could have done just as good or better job at work on our laser jet."
4,Good Introduction to some great desert spaces...,"A very good general-purpose trail guide to California's desert parks. Fairly detailed, for all it has to cover. If you were hiking one specific park most of the time you might want something a little more in-depth, but with a good topo map and plenty of water, this book will suffice for a lot of trails.One word of warning: desert hiking and camping is not the same as hiking more well-traveled forest parks. If you aren't experienced with a map, a compass or GPS, run out of water, or otherwise get into trouble, you can run into survival problems very quickly. I strongly advise hiking with a partner, leaving an itinerary, and getting some additional information on desert navigation, equipment, and trip planning. One excellent resource for that extra information is The Ultimate Desert Handbook by Mark Johnson."
3,This one has Cassette but doesn't have MP3 Capability,"This is a good CD and Cassette player. But, it doesn't play Mp3 CD's. Mp3 CD's are the current technology that permits about 10 hours of music on ONE CD! The Mp3's are especially useful for books on tape as you can have an entire book on one or sometimes 2 CD's! My suggestion is to find the Sony (Model ZSSN10PS) that has capability for regular AND Mp3 CD--- unless you play alot of cassettes---in which case get this one. Or better yet, by this one AND the ZSSN10PS...if you're rich that is! :o) Email:boland7214@aol."
1,Broke in less than 8 months!,"Like others who've written reviews, the CD player is giving a 'no disc' message. I just wish I'd seen the reviews before we wasted our money on it... This is the 2nd Sony in a row to quit on us. Fool me once, shame on you; Fool me twice, shame on me. This is the last time I'll ever buy a Sony anything!"
4,Buy it for the speakers if you won't miss the features,"I had a gift certificate to Amazon.com and bought this because it seemed to have the best speakers and it didn't look like it was created for a 14 year-old's bed room. If it had been my money, I would have kept looking.I do miss some features that, for $80, really should be on this boom box. (c'mon, it's 2005).- line-in (so I don't have to burn CDs everytime I want to play from my iPod--I _do_ like the speakers)- MP3 playback (labeling anything with CDR/RW should mean MP3 compatibility by now)- the cassette deck is manual (?) my kids have tapes though I don't think I do. But, manual? (i.e. can't control via remote)"
4,The sound is worth the annoying parts.,"I bought this anyway after reading about the small display. I toyed with returning it for a couple of days - yes, the display is small and hard to read. The other annoying part is in programming the radio stations - not intuitive or easy. I ended up manually programming in the presets which was a bit of a hassle. After all is said and done, I am glad to have this machine - the size is right and the sound is very good. I bought this for my office and will use the remote for most functions as most of the controls are on the top of the box and I am setting this up on a file cabinet. CD and tape inserts are on the top as well. For the money it is a good buy. The others I looked at that were easier to use with comparable sound cost about $50+ higher."
3,"Good sound, but CD player died quickly",I bought this for an aunt who is hard of hearing and not tech savvy. It took her a few days to figure out but she did and now she loves it. Great sound she says though she was comparing it to something pretty bad. It arrived quickly too.CD player broke down after a few months.
2,Not impressed with the system,"I bought this system because I got my mom a Sony CFD-S350 system, and I was very impressed with the sound quality and the price. I bought this one after listening to it compared to many other boomboxes in BestBuy, and decided to buy it based on how it sounded to the other systems, and also that I was very pleased with my mother's. I've had this system for about 3 months now, but I haven't really used it much since the first few weeks, b/c the sound quality really bothers me. When I turn my system a few notches, it quickly picks up a static fuzziness. It may just be my system, b/c it didn't seem like I heard that distortion in BestBuy, but it also could have been that all the background noise in the store covered it up. On a positive note, the system does have a cassette player and a pretty decent radio, but based on my experience, I could not recommend this system to someone else."
3,Good Enough,"It's no Bose Wave Radio, but it's also not five-hundred dollars. You get what you pay for, and in the case of this radio that's not a bad thing. This is a decent radio at a decent price. Will you love it; probably not. Will you like it; absolutely. Boy recommends it."
1,Won't play after 3 months,"I purchased this boombox for my daughter's room. Basically, we put in a CD at bedtime, and set the sleep timer for 30 minutes. NOT heavy or detailed use ... I bought this unit because of the timer. After 3 months, when you push the play button (either remote or manually) the machine would sporadically play the CD. Usually after 2 or 3 'no disc' errors, and a power shutoff, it would eventually play. Now it's completely a 'no disc' error message. Of course, Sony's warranty person explained that it's a 90 day warranty ... imagine that! A COMPLETE waste of my money. If I'd have wanted a cheap machine to last a few months, I would have bought one. I paid extra for this one so it would last! I'll be hard pressed to buy Sony again!!!"
2,Okay read,Way to much detail and explanation. Should cover more global topics. Good research. Coverage of what happened after the battle is too complicated annd contradictory. Battle itself is well covered.
4,Gripping account,"A much needed telling of a forgotten incident that occurred after the fall of Saigon in Vietnam. Journalist Wetterhahn gives several different viewpoints of the capture of the SS Mayaguez by the Khmer Rouge and from the captain of the vessel. Adding some autobiographical detail, Wetterhahn travelled with an American recovery team to Cambodia, interviewed a Kmer Rouge officer and helped as much as he could with the recovery of American remains.Although the prose is choppy in parts, this is a gripping account of the attempted rescue of the crew of the SS Mayaguez and how the White House micromanaged it and later covering up the deaths of Marines and Air Force policemen in the attempted rescue. Most poignant of all, is the backstory of the three Marines who were left behind and whatever fate awaited them.Informative and good history for those who were not aware of the incident back in May of 1975."
1,This book is not as good as people claim...,"I love how all of the other authors were nice enough to grace this book and proclaim it an excellent read, however, after talking to people who were involved in this operation i can't honestly recommend this book. Granted people's perceptions are different but this book just doesn't seem to have all the facts straight. There may be no definitive book on the subject, but this author should have done more of his own research rather than boring other authors research (in order to save time? who knows)."
1,i paid for this?,first off they need to specify its a dvd and not a vhs in the title. i had no problem paying 70 bucks for a vhs of this movie. but where its a burnt copy of the movie off a vhs that someone recorded off tv...the price needs to come down. way down. the skeletons in the beginning and end were discolored. i will be returning this for sure. price is unreal for a burnt copy of the movie. i will be downloading the movie off youtube. price should of been 10-20 bucks max.
4,Disney's Halloween Treat.,"Good condition. Video played thoroughly, no problems. It was shipped out in a speedy fashion. I would buy from this seller again."
3,Disney's Halloween treat,"This isn't the one I remember as a kid growing up in the early 80's. This one featured the talking pumpkin and not the magic mirror and is not as long. It's ok but not as good as the first one. As other people who have reviewed this vhs version have said, why Disney hasn't released both versions on DVD as most fans have requested or begged for, I have no idea. I guarantee that it would be one of their top sellers ever."
5,Love Disney's Halloween Treat... when will it be on DVD?,This DVD has several wonderful Disney Halloween cartoons to really get you in the Halloween spirit. I am very anxious to find out when it will be coming on DVD!
4,Nice Light Scent -Great Moisturizer,"The Mandarin fragrance is very light. It is a fragrance oil and not an essential oil, which is a big problem for me. I prefer a more natural product made with essential oils.Fragrance aside, the products themselves are awesome. The Whip is a lighter body lotion. The Wrap is an incredible Body Butter. It is thick and filled with shea butter and other fine ingredients.I like the Scrub and the Mousse as well. The Mousse does not leave my skin dry as most shower gels, etc. do."
5,Wish I could find a Million like it!!,"Romance Addict says,Wish I could find a Million like it!!This was a terrific story! If you have always fantasized about becoming your best friend's lover, this is for you! I wish there were a thousand books with similar plots. Plus, the characters were well developed and it was hot, hot, hot at times too! Loved it! If anyone else has read stories on this same idea, please let me know!Also recommended: 'Something Wicked' by: Jo Beverley"
5,Quite Satisfied,"Loved the book, had read it before and had lost it in a move. Took me forever to find the title again, but it was here in no time and I was quite pleased with the price."
2,It's okay,"He's kinda cute and it's neat how his arms are flexible, but he isnt real cuddly and I didnt like the story."
4,Victor Borge's Funniest Moments,"Very good, however it is 100% identical to Victor Borge Act One and Two."
3,missing the best of all....,"OK, Victor is definitly on of the funniest performers ever.Nevertheless, after seeing through this one, I really miss the most funny clip ever, namely the Singing-Punctuation part with Dean Martin on Deans show. No collections are complete without that one, but luckily you can check it out on YouTube."
5,Hilarious!!!,"If you love pure comedy, you'll love this video. He was not only an accomplished pianist but a brilliant commedian. These snippets of his funniest moments will make you want to watch this video all over again."
4,Victor Borge DVDs,"The Victor Borge DVDs are as entertaining as expected.The quality of picture sometimes reflects the era in which they were filmed, but this tends to add to the ambience. For one buying sets of Borge , it pays to check the contents carefully as there is an overlap in content."
5,Movies,This was for my husband who has spent hours laughing with Victor Borge. His style is unique yet still enjoyable.
4,"entertaining, but won't win any new fans","It's kind of a low budget production, and many of the clips are very old, even black and white. But if you're a fan of Victor Borge or like the older-style comedy, it's pretty entertaining."
3,Victor Borge's Funniest Moments,"Very good, even if in ""The Timid Page Turner"" the scene with the ""William Tell Overture"" it has been broken away from this publication."
4,A very grand Carmen,"This Carmen probably has the most distinguished cast on records -- Leontyne Price, Franco Corelli, Mirella Freni, and Robert Merrill, plus the conducting of Herbert von Karajan. Everyone is in good voice, and the Vienna Philharmonic plays beautifully, attending lovingly to the many fine details of Bizet's score. All in all, it's a very grand affair. And that's the problem. Carmen is not Lohengrin or Don Carlo; it's really an intimate drama about simple people, soldiers, gypsies, peasants, and smugglers. That intimacy doesn't survive the star treatment and deliberateness of von Karajan's approach. Much of the drama does come through, since the leads were all highly accomplished in their art, but I am never able to shake the feeling that I'm listening to superstars act like Merimee's characters. This is not a bad Carmen by any means; it's simply a bit off the mark."
3,"so far off the mark, it's almost hypnotic","I owned this Carmen in 1965 and loved it for Prices' incredibly lush singing of the title role. Now I am a grownup, however, and there's a lot wrong here, notably in the inflated style that couldn't be further from Bizet's opera comique. Every voice sings out heroically, especially the bawling Corelli, whose French is so bad that it's almost a new language. Karajan conducts with splash but also in the grand style. I can't listen to this reading anymore, despite Price and Freni, the standouts in the cast."
4,revamped vio-lence but different!?,"this cd is the bi-product of vio-lence getting dropped by their record label and rob flynn starting machine head and the music scean turning away from heavier and faster music and promotting rap and grunge.this cd has the remaining members of vio-lence(perry strickland,phil demmel,dean dell) changing their signature sound to try to regain their foot hold in music much like laaz rockit changeing to gack it's nothing impressing but not bad either just not the same style or sound you may expect."
3,ex-vio-lence members 3.5 stars,"this is the post vio-lence project very good if i remember correctly most of the same members except rob flyn he was getting machine head going.If memory serves deen dell,perry stickland,phil demmel and I forget the other guitarist.they are a 4 piece at this time not up to the vio-lence standard but worth a listen. rob's/machine heads- burn my eyes was much better and nothing to gain was alot better too.In my eyes nothing could touch the first 2 vio-lence cds& the ep.this is the only torque cd I know of -don't get confused by the other torque band.take it or leave it this was the last throws of vio-lence at the time.good but far from great!"
2,book review,The book I ordered was supposed to be in good condition. Every blank in the book is written in. I would like to have known this before buying.
1,Don't Bother,Various Artists does not mean the original artists. It means some random unnamed musicians attempting to sound like the original artists. And doing a poor job.
3,Maybe I just got a bad copy...,"I've heard nothing but praise for this cycle, but I don't know. Isn't anyone but me put off by:A) The mushy and shallow sound?B) Davis's humming and grunting throughout the 5th?C) The often blaring, almost comical brass?The best things this cycle has going for it are sure-footed tempos and a sort of unadorned interpretation that fits Sibelius. I would have probably given it at least four stars if not for the above mentioned gripes."
3,great storage...hard to move,"i wanted to keep my dvds stored under the same category. unfortunately, i did not realize that over 500 disks would not be that easy to move around. my advice to all: it is better to have two or more holding 300s than one holding 500s"
5,"What a bargin, something you don't find very much these days",This is a great case. You can even add more pages if you want to. I wish I would have found this a few years ago so I wouldn't have to have the other cases I have but I will find uses for them all :)
5,520 Disc Capacity Black leather-Like Quality CD Wallet,This CD wallet was perfect my husband DJ's on the side and had CD every where. When this came it was excatley waht he needed and the case is light and very manageable.
2,Cheap camera for a cheap price,Reasons not to buy this camera:1) Eats up batteries.2) Extremely delayed point & shoot time (typically around 3 seconds)3) Bulky and heavy.I have found this is true with all Canon PowerShot A400s.Hope this helped.
2,Great while it lasted,"This was a wonderful camera, while it lasted. The quality and clarity of pictures taken with it was amazing. Movie mode was easy to use and the mini-movies taken with it were the perfect size to upload to any website.The functions were easy to figure out if you chose not to read the manual.The draw back? After exactly 25 days of first using the camera, it stopped working. Completely. It will turn on but that's it. No ability to take pictures or view those already taken. I'm not an avid user, I probably used it a total of 10 times. Perhaps this was a defective model I had the misfortune of recieving? In any event I plan to exchange it and see if I have better luck with another one. It was a wonderful camera when it actually worked. The lack of useage life was the reasons for the low star count."
5,Two of the Best Episodes from Season 1,"""The Parliament of Dreams"" is a wonderful introduction to the religious beliefs of the major alien powers. Ambassador Londo Mollari (Peter Jurasik) is hilarious during a Centauri religious banquet. Lennier (Bill Mumy) arrives at Babylon 5, joining Ambassador Delenn (Mira Furlan) as her new aide. Much to his dismay, Ambassador G'Kar (Andreas Katsulas) learns that one of the pilgrims arriving at Babylon 5's religious festival is an assassin from the Narn homeworld. In ""Mind War"" Talia Winters (Andrea Thompson) is reunited with her Psi Corps instructor and lover Jason Ironheart, the ill-fated subject of an EarthForce experiment designed to increase telepathic powers in Psi Corps telepaths. In pursuit of Ironheart is Psi Cop Alfred Bester (Walter Koenig) who willing bends rules and regulations trying to capture Ironheart. Without question, both were among the finest episodes of Babylon 5's first season."
3,Marred by poor video quality,"First, let me say that I really like this DVD. The scientific material is excellent and I love Tomita's version of the Holst symphonies. The problem is with the video quality. It would appear that the culprit is a combination of poor source material and really bad mpeg encoding. Hopefully it will be re-released in a cleaned up version with the option to turn off the narration so that Tomita's music can be enjoyed."
1,Do Not Engage! Do Not Make It So! Resistance Is Not Futile!,"Even though Patrick Stewart could make the phone book sound like Shakespeare, even he cannot save this DVD. While informationally rich, the sci-fi quality computer generated graphics (such as those found on Mr. Stewart's former TV gig) are SORELY lacking. Instead, the viewer is given a few NASA simulations which are good, and far too many 50's-era spacey illustrations--which are not.To go to the trouble of having sci-fi's most famous face (& scalp!) involved in this project, one would have hoped for comparable graphics. Stellar Cartography, anyone?..."
4,"Patrick Stewart Narrates ""The Planets""","It's very, very good but it needs 5.1. There's no point watching/listening on an ordinary TV or stereo. There's no region coding. It plays fine on a region 2 player."
2,not sure yet,I purchased Quick Fix based on the reviews I read. I'm not sure If I like the stuff. The other reviewer said it kept the pond water completely clear. Well I'm not having the same results. I think I'm going back to Alge Fix. It works better and it keeps my rocks clean.
3,Just Okay,"I thought this book was just okay. I think I expected more from the ratings, but it just didn't do anything for me. The characters are good but nothing spectacular happened in the book to really make me think WOW what a tremendous love story."
2,2.5 stars,"Beauty and the Beast gets a new twist as Lucien Delacourte journeys to Elmstone Manor where a veiled lady haunts the gardens. Even through the veil, he can see the beauty of her soul, perhaps even of face, yet he hides behind a mask of his own unseen that stand between him and love. As two haunted, scarred souls work through the maze to find love, in direct contrast stands the troubled marriage of Sarah's brother and his cruel wife who is bent on seducing Lucien. If you have longed for a true Gothic romance, then this will satisfy your need. Like an impressionistic painting of light and shadows, this is a work of art.Reviewed by Amanda Killgore."
2,A Little Deceptive,"I purchased this book to work on my '68 Shelby GT-350. I figured there would be a lot of information in this book on Shelbys (the car on the cover is a Shelby). I could not find any unique information on the car. The repair instructions seem very generic and somewhat vague, and the images and diagrams look like old photocopies...not very helpful.Overall, a disappointment. I thought Chilton's books were better than that."
2,SHORT ON DETAIL,"very disappointed,lacks steps in making repairs. slighty more helpful then the owners manual. one born every minute!"
2,Chilton's Mustang repair manual 64-73 ... :-(,"This book is okay for some simpler repair and maintainance jobs. Use it in conjunction with some better books for any serious repairs. It leaves out LOTS of important details in many cases. I would NEVER try rebuilding your engine using this book. The pictues are grainy and can be hard to see what its illustrating. The electrical section is somewhat lacking. Try and find a used copy or borrow one. The best part about it is, IF you are working on a 71-73 Mustang, ALL the photos are of a 72 Mustang with a 302."
2,Get the actual make/model shop manual instead.,"These chilton books really annoy me because when the repair gets ugly, they always state something like, ""please take your vehicle to an authorized repair shop"". Also, the particular book Amazon sent me had my year/make/model wiring diagram torn out of it. WTF? By the time I discovered this, the return deadline had passed. I also bought the CD version of the original shop manual and it's 10x better anyway so no big loss."
3,Good for simple maintenance,I bought this book to help me on restoring an 1967 Mustang.The book came weel packed but I was a little desapointed with the photos. They look very old and sometimes difficult to realize what it is.I felt also that a lot of details where resumed. But it is a good book if you want to do a simple maintenance and begin to understand how the car works.
3,Not the best book...,the pictures and figures is from other cars than you expected. So it shows simular ways to do it and not the exact. This one did not give me details on how to fix a -68 Mustang. to general.
1,Waste of Money,"This book was a complete waste of money...it has a lot of pages but little useful information.Simple specifications, Tolerances, and Torque Requirements are all non-existent.And the delivery from the book-seller was pathetic...to say the least. They shipped it by UPS who then delivered it to the US Post Office, where it sat for almost a week before they decided I had waited long enough.I'll NEVER order from Amazon again if they don't change their delivery system."
3,Missing A/C info,"Would have thought factory A/C information such as freon capacity, compressor types and more A/C in general would be included. A/C information boiled down to ""take it to a A/C repairman. Hmmmm, already knew that!!!!!!!!"
1,disappointed,"This book seems to be very thorough in it's attempt to give a foundation of what being a Christian is all about. Sadly, if Christ is the focus then only 6 references to Jesus are made or what he said. All of the rest are references from Paul, Peter, John, James or Jude. Given the fact that Jesus was a Jew, there is no evidence of this nor is there any evidence that he expected people following him to accept his Jewish teachings. Being a Christian from the content of this book seems to be a whole new religion having nothing to do with Judaism. Therefore I find this book not helpful and on another track. Good for those who wish to not really follow a Jewish but to follow an entirely different Jesus than he really was."
5,"A superb performance of a strange, compelling opera","This is an absolutely superb performance of an strange but compelling opera. All the principles--Gergiev, Gorchakova, Leiferkus--acquit themselves brilliantly and the Kirov forces couldn't be bettered. Most important, this is one of the most powerful and original scores Prokofiev ever composed, and that's saying a lot."
3,For CST Class,"You should buy this book only when your instructors require it. It's not well-organized for students to conquer Intercultural Communication. My professor is publishing his book of mastering this skill, and I am waiting for it."
3,Won't work for my needs,"Seems like a nice product, quality is better than I expected just looking at it out of the box, but since it goes from dim to light and not the reverse it won't work for my needs. I wanted it for a baby's room and we make the light progressively darker. Once he is asleep if I want to turn off the light I have to make the room super bright first, which would wake him up. I'm sure I'll find a use for it somewhere in the house, but I wish they even made just a regular on/off switch along with the dimmer so you don't have to brighten the room to turn off the light."
1,Skylink MT-200 Magic Tap Touch Dimmer with Remote,Ordered 4 Units with remote controlsOut of the 4 units 3 remotes did not work with the unitesPure Junk
3,Outdoor fireplaces,"I thought there would be more information about building an outdoor fireplace. But alas, only a short paragraph that said to refer to a fireplace builder! That's why I bought the book, so I wasted my $$!"
3,Too instructional,After reading the reviews we were still in the looking for ideas stage and this wasn't much help for that.
3,Sunset Barbecurs & Outdoor Kitchens,"Good pictures, however, I would have preferred more detailed ""how to"" instructions."
3,Fine Concert - Lackluster Video,"A good 90+ minute concert -- a nice mix of hits and some albumcuts and his voice is strong. There is some poor editing between thefirst and second acts (I attended a show during this tour), and there's a bit too much of the medley material.I had this on tape, and the video of this DVD unfortunately isn't much better (watch the scroll credits and wait for the motion sickness). This seems to have been shot using video, and someone purposely used a soft focus for most of the close-ups of Manilow while the crowd shots are sharp. For some, the good news is the option to hear remastered 5.1 audio. I don't have a set-up like that, so I can't give any further news on that.However, I've been a Manilow fan for 25 years so for me, this purchase was a no-brainer. And if you've read this far, it's probably the same for you."
5,"Culture, Class, Sophistication, Manilow","You really can't get any better than Manilow, especially by today's standards. Barry Manilow is a master showman, even if you don't like him, you have to admit it: He has what it takes. ""The Greatest Hits....And Then Some"", really specifies that you have to be able to put on a great show. Song after song, each is a spectacle. Look at the opening, I saw the concert tour, it's amazing (especially when you're in the theatre), the way the curtain unfolds, there is Manilow. Copacabana is done superbly. The finale is just as brilliant. Through great cotumes, lighting, back-up groups, you'll want to watch and watch!"
5,"St. Charbel, mystic of the east",This book was a great buy it was in great shape. It was a easy read and a very inspiring book.
2,Lacking Shostakovich Colour,"General consensus has confined the Second and Third Symphonies of Dmitri Shostakovich to the rubbish bin of his repertoire. Indeed, the composer himself disowned them. There is intrigue and excitement in the Second, but the present third is uneventful and totally unmemorable. Nevertheless, Jansons typically makes it sound convincing.In the Fourteenth, Shostakovich is, again, not as spectacular as he was in his preceding compositions. Sergey Aleksashkin cannot be faulted however, his Russian is vividly caught and his sonorous tone is perfectly matched to Shostakovich's vocal vision. Larissa Gogolewskaja is not in the same league as her famed accompaniment. Jansons is typically fine, as is his fantastic Bavarian forces.Again, both these works suffer from a lack of sparkle and are unmemorable. They certainly do not belong in a highlights collection of Shostakovich. For completists only."

4,"Great series, but blu-ray is regular quality","I love this series, but this blu-ray was a bit disappointing. There is a bit more noise and the black isn't as deep as I'd expect. Also, the voices sound muffled at times - particular Paul Giamatti as John Adams. But this is still an amazing series about an important time in our history. As historical fiction, it's second to none. Excellent acting and plot development that stays remarkably close to David McCullough's biographyJohn Adams. Definitely worth the purchase, especially at Amazon.com's price."
5,John Adams DVD,"This set of DVDs arrived very quickly, actually before promised. The DVD presented a show better than I had expected. I had read the book many years ago, and although I saw some discrepencies the DVD was exceptional.John Adams (HBO Miniseries)"
5,Perfect!,Item arrived quickly and exactly as promised. Item was in perfect condition. Great experience!
4,Good drama,"Although it's a bit soap opera-ish, the backdrop of American history (and that of John Adams) makes it entertaining. Good acting by the cast makes it a quality production."
5,Tremendous mini series,I basically could not stop watching this miniseries. I don't have time at anyone time to watch this type of mini series when on HBO. Thois was fantastic in portrayal of our infancy as a country.
4,I love history,We watched this series several years ago when it first came out on dvd but we didn't use the on screen historical guide. This time we did. Very informative guide. The acting is excellent as are the sets. Very convincing and probably a lot more accurate than the history I read as a kid in grade school. Highly recommended viewing.
5,Great for History or Government Teachers,"I highly recommend the first couple episodes for teachers of the American Revolution and early government. Even my more disinterested students find them very good. For other teachers, I have worksheets created for every episode (and their keys) so please reply to this post with your email if you would like them. Enjoy this great work!"
5,Absolutely wonderful,"If history were taught like this in school when I was going (many years ago) I would have learned much more as well as enjoyed the entire 'school' experience. We were taught to learn dates and what happened, not the reasons behind the events. Although I am now a woman of 50+ years, I have found a new love of learning about how this wonderful country of ours was formed and who were the actual leaders (and relationships to each other) who fought for our freedom. I can not say enough about this item."
5,Great! Sent on time.,All was well! Thanks for sending it on time and in good shape. It was a gift and was sent right to the giftee. Perfect
5,John Adams HBO Miniseries,"The John Adams miniseries was the best made for TV production I have ever seen. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in the history of the founders. It brought them to life as people we can relate to and appreciate the sacrifices they made. In the end, they were real people, real Americans."
5,Amazing History,I watched the series on HBO and wanted to have it to show my children and grandchildren.It is fabulous and will give you goosebumps watching the birth of our country. Cudos for HBO for doing this series.I hope they will be inspired to do more shows that inspire not degrade.
1,John Adams (HBO Miniseries),"A harmless DVD but a complete anticlimax of a film. Best watched with a US format box, doesn't work on a UK machine."
2,"Homer Simpson, Founding Father?","I agree with most of the negatives people have laid out regarding this series. I don't think anyone who watches it can come away with an accurate view of Adams or the time period unless they have prior knowledge. I'm not going to give a long list of my disappointments with this film since they've already been said by others, but I'll leave you with this one observation that has so far gone unnoticed or unmentioned:IN TOO MANY SCENES, JOHN ADAMS LOOKS LIKE A FLESH AND BLOOD VERSION OF HOMER SIMPSON."
1,Don't Blame the Material!,"Let's call a spade a spade--this was just not very good movie making. I forced myself to watch every episode but the finale (my dedication has limits). Each time I wanted the show to do well, but each time it left me oddly unengaged, as if I were getting the story second-hand from a disinterested correspondent. Is it the curse of the American revolution, whose story can't seem to be made into an entertaining movie?"
1,There is no John Addams Here,"McCullough's excellent book is poorly treated in this mini-series. After watching the series you have no clue of what Addams or the founding fathers accomplished.Addams and Hamilton are particularly poorly portrayed, you have have no clue to Addams fiery nature or Hamilton's financial dynamo and the impact they had on the creation of the country.The series is ultimately boring because it give us no insight into the great accomplishment that was the lives of these men and women.Much like the movie Ray at the end we have not yet seen what made John Addams great. Read McCullough's book or Ron Chernow's Hamilton, they give a sense of great adventure and accomplishment of these men."
3,Unnecessary nudity and poor camera technique,"Sadly, as in many movies based on books, the book was better. They play with the facts. The tar and feather scene shows full frontal nudity which was completely unnecessary. Unfortunately I didn't preview this before my children watched it with the family.The Boston Massacre is a pivotal event in American History. Too bad they didn't represent it accurately. Products of public school education will be easily misled.The cinematography is very poor. Many of the shots are way out of frame and the camera seems to be handheld by a person with a tremor problem. I began to get seasick. I kept wanting to change the camera frame and get a steady mount for it.I liked the acting. John and Abagail were as I imagined them to be when I read the book. The costumes and scenery made me feel as though I was observing the events first hand. This made the jittery, poorly framed scenes even more disappointing."
2,Boring,"The production values were great, but really, this was just DULL. I don't know how it won so many awards -- it's like they think a lot of low lighting and scenes spoken in whispers (which i couldn't hear w/o cranking up the volument) made it 'classy.' I blinked and missed the Boston Tea Party. Still not sure when they did the Rev War and Dec of Inde. And sorry, but I just couldn't stand watching Paul Gia in scene after scene looking like a pop-eyed toad.Historical inaccuracies were also annoying. Minor point, but the Title menu was not quite intuitive and tedious to maneuver thru.In addition, altho i bought this set new, and my dvd player is new, it hung up several times in my player. I ended up not even watching disc 3, too frustrating when it froze my player."
3,What's with the drunk camera work??,"I generally enjoyed the series. But as some have already mentioned here, the inexplicable tilting of the camera is a real annoyance. It is the major flaw in the series and adds nothing except the idea that Adams lived in a 'crazy' time, if that was even the intent. Like the old Batman series, where the Riddler's lare was on this perpetual tilt to depict the 'chaos'. Maybe that was the same idea. Who knows? A shoulder held camera would have been much more appropriate, giving the viewer the sense of 'being there'."
2,ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ!!,"BORING!if you are looking for hours of conversations dragging on and on this is for you! little tip,brew a pot of coffe."
5,John Adams HBO Mini Series,"This mini-series was excellent! It followed historical facts so closely that I felt like I was living in that era. I feel the characters were depicted truthfully, and realistically. I home school my son, and plan on having him watch parts of this to give him a clearer picture of what life was like during those times. I recommend this for anyone (younger children with supervision due to graphic scenes at times)."
5,John Adams Miniseries,"John and Abigail Adams life during and after the American Revolution and his travels in support of the new Republic is detailed extremely well. The portrayals are excellent. David McCullough's book has been very well translated to the screen. Adams is a towering figure (albeit his physical stature was not tall) in the history of our nation. Although he was opposed to slavery in principle, he compromised in order to insure the inclusion of the southern states within the union. This is a wonderful and accurate production."
4,Pretty good,"Giamatti brought his A game to this ambitious production and was supported by an equally impressive cast. By McCullough's account Adams was a strong but complex character. The series does successfully show that the founding fathers were all different but came together for one common cause. It's weird that his refusal to go to war with France likely cost him a second term and then when you compare that with the USA's recent history. My only complaint was that most of the time jumps were a bit jarring. Laura Linney also turned in one of her best performances. I literally had tears in my eyes during her death scene. Bravo. Overall, this is definitely a series worth watching."
4,Realistic,"Very realistic account of history. Even if you are not a history buff, you will enjoy this series."
5,Great Miniseries,"This is a fantastic Blu-ray, have watched it numerous times, all the acting is excellent and shows that period of time and what our Founders had to endure for us"
5,I like history.,Someone wrote that history is a pack of tricks we play on the dead. It doesn't apply to this production. Fascinating study of the great men who sacrificed much to found our nation.
2,Unengaging. And indifferent acting,What was the secret? Why did Paul Giammati and Laura Linney spend so much time whispering? And why did they spend so much time having discussions in bed? Maybe because the series was boring. Like their acting.
2,not true to the book,"The portrayal of John Adams is not in line with David McCollugh's's book on John Adams, from which this mini-series is taken. Adams is portrayed in the video as egotistical, belligerent, and prickly. His relationship with his wife in the book is much less antagonistic and more loving than portrayed in the video. Just to try and enhance the book contents, HBO added in a short romantic interlude between Adams and his wife upon his return from France, which was both plainly gratuitous and completely unnecessary.I felt that HBO took a calculated risk (and lost) by changing the character's on screen personalities to add extra 'drama' to the film, whereas in the book, Adam's life is much more peaceful, and personally, would have been more attractive to watch onscreen.Read the book, forget the video."
2,Disappointed,"I was very disappointed with this series. I only watched half of it. The insert in the box said it was rated PG but I didn't know that full frontal nudity, and explicit love scenes, were included in that rating. I expected a film that would give my family a better understanding of history, not sex-education and anatomy. It was also more gory than I expected. None of that needed to be in there to portray the historical events. There should have been a warning in the purchase information. My children were appalled that I would buy something like this. It was very embarrassing that I did. I bought it because I love American history but ""Hollywood"" has to ruin everything. When will they learn that they don't have to include sex and gore to sell a film."
3,"Great acting, but Cameras Gone Wild.","I was really looking forward to watching this movie and learning more about the subject after reading the book. The acting was splendid and the casting was perfect. Unfortunately the actual camera-work, specifically the constant/extreme tilting of the camera, was very off-putting. I sometimes felt rather sea-sick and would have to go back and listen again to what the actors had just said because all the tilting to and fro of the camera had really pulled my attention away from the script. Not sure what the director was thinking. By the end of the movie I wondered aloud why the director didn't just, ""turn the bloody camera upside down and get it over with"". Then, of course, he finally did in the last section of the film. Very odd. But other than having a possessed camera, I'd say the film is worth renting at the very least."
4,Great series; however Amazon video service is poor,Only one episode was received in HD. Rest were of lesser quality. Series title score and history of Adams was fantastic.
3,Slow,I had read and enjoyed the biography. I suppose with a book you can stop reading when you get bogged down with facts. With the DVD it seemed to be work to continue watching.
5,Accurate Portrait Of Greatness,"""John Adams"" is a powerful. accurate depiction of a great man. Stodgy, unyielding, John Adams nevertheless was a bulwark of consistency as a tireless patriot and a strict constitutionalist. He was vocal in his rejection that the newly formed country adopt the fleshy indulgences of Europe, namely France and proved an effective, if relucant negotiator. Paul Giammani was superb in the role of our Second President who if outwardly aloof was privately emotional. Laura Linney played the perfect helpmate in Abigail Adams, who was quick both to encourage her husband and to constructively criticize whenever John got too bombastic. This series was a matchless viewing experience."
4,Who Knew? About John Adams.,"John Adams is largely one of those people in history that all I know is his name and that he was, at one time, a president. After viewing this miniseries, I decided to look up the historical account of Mr. Adam's life and found that HBO was pretty historically accurate.Paul Giamatti's portrayal of John Adams was realistic and personal. The series was shot beautifully in historically recreated locations to give the film an authentic feel.If you are an American history buff, I highly recommend John Adams by HBO."
5,John Adams DVD,This is one of the best historical mini-series I have ever seen. The man and his time are brought to life. Great DVD package!
3,At least it wasn't directed by Ron Howard,"John Adams. Sadly while the movie makes some historical revisions in character and misses or overlooks other important facts, the movie series itself is truly a love story in the birth of a Nation and of husband and wife and of friendship. After reading many of the reviews of this miniseries I have become torn and inquisitive. The miniseries John Adams, and the before mentioned, has now inspired me to read the book of the same title by David McCullough and other historical documentation of the time, like the Constitution."
5,Great Review for US History class,"Video is excellent in its portrail of the clothing and the setting in Boston just prior to and after the American Revolution. Great dialogue between Adams and Jefferson as well as a great trail scene in which John Adams successfully defends the British soldiers who fired their rifles at the Boston Massacre. X,Y,Z affair was only eluded to, yet the full understanding that the French in the newly created US were causing trouble and war with France was soon to come...Excellent for US history understanding and conceptualizing. A MUST see."
5,Great movie in a series,This movie was wonderfully put together and is a fairly accurate representation of U.S. history before; during; and after the revolutionary war. 6 stars.
2,John Adams video,"Was disappointed; found it boring. But then I've become addicted to Breaking Bad, fast action/violence/suspense,so this might have spoiled me for John Adams more slow plot development."
5,A Great Story.,A very interesting and well done historical film. I think the acting was great and managed to hold my interest.
4,John Adams a Winner...!,"Good production, acting, musical score. Interesting how little regard there was for an ex-President. Recommend for all American history buffs."
5,John Adams,"I have read many, many biographies and auto-biographies of great Americans from the Revolutionary War to the 21st century and an even greater number of historical non-fiction books written about amazing people during amazing times in history. None equal this one. If a Pulitzer winner could win a Pulitzer, the novel this movie was based on should be it.The HBO series did justice to David McCullough's incredible masterpiece of John and Abigail Adams in every way. Based almost entirely on their private correspondence, the very words that these great Americans wrote and spoke will make you weep when you understand their vision and sacrifice for the freedoms we enjoy and take for granted every day."
5,A Story Both Timely and Timeless,"The timing couldn't be better to tell the story of the American Revolution through the eyes of John Adams than in an election year!I spent the first 34 years of my life in Philadelphia. Being raised and immersed in the city's rich history is second nature to most natives, and the HBO series was not something new to be learned, but a reminder of something always known, just relegated to the background of consciousness.The angst and indecision of the Founding Fathers whether to break from England, the hardships and diseases they endured because of that decision; even (perhaps especially) their repugnance at holding the Congressional Congress in Philadelphia, gave new dimension to a story that's been told over and over again. Times may change but people don't, and that is a reason not to despair, but to take heart and create our own timeless story."
5,John would be pleased!,"I have long been an Adams fan since watching the PBS series The Adams Chronicles in the 70's. The books by Joseph Ellis (Founding Brothers, Passionate Sage, American Sphinx, and At the Creation) served to further deepen my esteem and appreciation for our second President, warts and all. The HBO mini-series John Adams is an outstanding portrayal and interpretation of David McCullough novel, bring John, his wife Abigail, and the times in which they lived and struggled vividly to life."
5,John Adams,"ThisJohn Adams (HBO Miniseries)production vividly illustrates the reality that John Adams, George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Alexander Hamilton, and all the others are not just plaster statues or monotonous names in a history book. They were real people: the lived, they loved, they laughed, they cried when they hurt, and they were mortal. They put all they had, including their lives, on the line to reach for an ideal. Many of them gave their lives, and those who didn't, gave up much of their lives. The years John and Abigail spent apart could never be recovered. Their story was repeated by thousands of others, and still is. As Adm. Tarrant (The Bridges at Toko-Ri)said, ""Where do we get such men?"" They set a standard for all of us."
4,Great Hisorical Film,"Our family enjoyed this miniseries. It gave my kids (8,12) a good feel for the early years of US history. The acting is terrific."
5,PAUL GIAMATTI at his best ! JOHN ADAMS inspires !,"This HBO Miniseries really impressed me. JOHN ADAMS is an inspiring watch for any American ! It is filmed great , Produced by Tom Hanks & great acting by PAUL GIAMATTI !"
5,excellent miniseries...already viewed it but wanted our own copy.,"Haven't watched it yet...been gone over two and a half weeks with a family funeral out of state. Will be watching it when I hook up the new bluray, which arrived the day before we had to leave...when it rains, it pours! Looking forward to viewing it when things can slow down a little!"
5,American History At Its Best!,"American history at its best as Paul Giamatti and Laura Linney bring John and Abigail Adams to life. Both Giamatti and Linney are brilliant in their performances,the supporting cast, the sets, and surroundings are so well done it transports you back in time giving everyone a piece of U.S. history well worth viewing.Bravo!"
1,Boredom made him do it,"If you watched this series from beginning to end, you'd feel like revolting, too. Terrible screenplay, put together like a line-by-line recitation of the historical novel. Abysmal lighting and anachronistic terminology."
1,First disk was good except for the full nudity,"I have to rate this one because of the unnecessary full male nudity and drawn out scenes of a woman's breast. This isn't about ""what's wrong with a human body"" argument time. This was a historical docudrama. The nudity only distracted from the story. It served absolutely no purpose. Had it been properly R rated, I wouldn't have to be writing this review because I would have skipped watching anything R rated from HBO.The above is a good enough reason to skip this series. However, the series didn't measure up after the first DVD. The first disk was very engaging for me. It was interesting how the US was begun, according to this story teller. I suppose I should read the book if it's at all based on fact. The last two DVDs were more soap opera interpersonal relationships that got boring after awhile."
4,Historical Masterpiece,"This movie kept my wife and I captivated for several days as we watched this mini series unfold.Very well done,and very close to how things were back then according to historical documents.We need to be aware of how our great nation was founded,and this is a great venue for learning more or being reminded of how the United States came to be.Just common ordinary people with great visionJohn Adams (HBO Miniseries)"
5,"A great show, worth watching","When I saw the first advertizing for this show and noticed that Paul Giamatti would have the leading role in HBO's mini-seriesJohn Adams (HBO Miniseries), I had my doubts that he could pull it off. However, after the first episode, I was completely hooked. Giamatti ended up more than ""pulling it off"", he did an outstanding job, doing justice to McCullough's wonderful novelJohn Adams.The producers took the time to do it right--costumes, set-design... even using the language of the day. At some points it was a challenge to easily penetrate the eloquent prose of the day; but it also made the production more genuine... as if I were transported back to the time period.I've ordered by copy online so we may enjoy it again and again.John CathcartAward-winning author of ""Delta 7"""
5,John Adams,"John Adams presents a dramatic and gritty portrayal of early life in America and abroad. The entire cast delivers believeable and authentic portrayals of key figures in early American history. I highly recommend this series to anyone who is looking for a great story, moving drama, and a step back in time to the roots of our countryJohn Adams (HBO Miniseries)"
4,John Adams (HBO) Miniseries,"We had been to Quincy Mass. and took a tour of John Adams first house and the newer and bigger one in what was called Pleasantville at that time, now it is all called Quincy. I wish I had seen the miniseries before the tour, some things would have been explained better. We also toured Boston histoical landmarks and John Adams was greatly involved in the American Revolution. I enjoyed the miniseries very much, it explained histoical facts that we did not read in our history books. My daughter is a fifth grade teacher and she plans to use the miniseries in her history lessons. I would recommend the John Adams Miniseries to any history lover who would appriciate the whole story. David McCullough wrote this great book and Tom Hanks made it into a great miniseries"
3,Great series...bad discs,"The discs did not play well in multiple DVD players. The final show would not get past half way, so I am 30min short from finishing the series."
3,"John Adams, a bit of a disappointment","I bought this movie with some credit that I'd accumulated and had heard enough about the film to be interested in watching. I was disappointed. The movie drones on and on and while it has plot and shows some history, it lacks any creativity in presentation. I would not suggest this movie to anyone searching for a bit of entertainment. If history and social media is your bag, this one might be for you--not for me."
2,John Adams HBO Miniseries,I read the book so the John Adams HBO Miniseries could not even compare. If you did not know your history you wouldn't know what was happening. Bad acting and choppy scenes.
5,History made interesting,John Adams miniseries; history made interesting and entertaining. What a concept. Stellar performances all around though Paul Giamatti was so intense at times it was borderline insanity. Probably just like the real Adams though. I would recommend this to anyone with even a passing interest in American History.
5,John Adams,"This is an awesome movie..every American should have to watch John Adams. You just can't stop watching, and you learn so much about your history."
5,Unveiling history,"This truly opened my eyes to the struggles we went through building the United States. It gave me a revitized appreciation for the personalities and sacrifices of our founding fathers. Paul Giamatti was John Adams and Laura Linley was Abigale Adams. Thoroughly enjoyed it, often going on to the next part to see what happened rather than waiting until the following night."
4,John Adams HBO Series,Excellent service and a great movie. I would order from this customer again in the future.
3,Not so hot,I was disappointed in the series. I thought it jumped over very interesting historical circumstances and the acting wasn't all that captivating. Read a book on Adams -- much better.
5,John Adams video,"Contains some nontaditional portrayals of some of the founding fathers; very informative, covering a vast amount of important events."
5,Real American Hero - John Adams,"...After all John Rambo received 4 Movies. Indiana Jones received 4 Movies. After 235 years how can John Adams finally receive his first movie as a true American hero. This is an excellent account of a great American, As nerdy as a John Adams was, his role was pivotal, in helping secure Washington's Troops. Learning patriotism doesn't begin or end with George Bush' definition of ""Patriotic duties"". After watching this movie I have a much clearer appreciation for the contributions of our nations second president. The acting of Paul Giamatti and Laura Linney is believable."
4,John Adams(HBO Miniseries),"A great miniseries, you need to have plenty of time to watch as it is very long. Great acting and fairly accurate. Recommend to all those who would like to know more about the founding of America. History buffs would enjoy."
4,History to share with you children,"This series shows just how different the lives and the thinking of our Founding Fathers are from our own. The ""struggle"" for Independence was a very narrowly won thing indeed. The exploration of the relationship between John and Abagail was given a very good treatment. The other theme worth noting is the concept of honor between men. The importance of Honor and the human weakness or strengths displayed as a result. It's a great series to have on hand for a snow-bound weekend."
5,Historically Accurate and Inspiring,"I don't subscribe to HBO and find almost everything they air offensive verbally and/or sexually. I heard that ""John Adams"" was different and ordered it through Amazon. Wow! What an amazing miniseries. Faithful to history both visually and verbally, Adams is portrayed as the significant American founding father that he was. John and his wife Abigail remind us of what marriage should be and can be in an imperfect, fallen world. They inspire us to live for greater things than ourselves, in service to God and country."
5,John Adams,"I absolutely loved the series, since I love history and this really very interesting. I honestly believe this was how most of actors acted as the true person.. I am also assuming they had to do much research to get all in order and correct. Naturally they have to add an interest ( family issues), but that is what makes the history fun and interesting to read.So, to me this is an excellent way to see our history of our country, instead of learning dates etc. in this mini series you see and feel like you were there. I wish history could be taught in this manner...students would remember just what happened and why!"
5,great gift,"We bought this as a gift for our son-in-law after watching the HBO series. I wish I had kept it for myself! The actors, especially Paul Giamatti as John Adams, really bring history and the period of the revolution, the writing of the constitution, the fight of America's independence to life. What a human side of these historic figures we have in this series. Having visited the same son-in-law in Boston I could visualize the places well since I had actually walked there. I would highly recommend this for a history buff or anyone interested in the struggles of our country in its beginnings."
4,Excellent series,We're only through the 1st two espisodes but are loving it.Now that we've discovered how to display the historic notation subtitles it's even more interesting. They don't interfere at all and provide important historical facts.Our rating is 4 instead of 5 only because this is a used set and one of thedisc holders is broken so the disc isn't secure in its case. The discs themselves are in perfect condition.
5,Outstanding presentation a truly incredible story,"My wife and I have loved David McCullough's books ""John Adams"" and ""1776"" for years. The script, acting, photography, costumes and sets in this presentation do a truly wonderful job of bringing this wonderful epic in American history to life. By the end of the 3-DVDs you really feel like you know and empathize with all of the individuals portrayed. We also enjoyed the add-on segment on David McCullough's life as a historian and writer very much. We will treasure this movie for years to come."
5,John Adams delivers,Saw this series originally on HBO and have used it in my classroom to give the kids a better idea of how things went before the revolution. The kids liked it and it was informative.Also used the subtitles that tells information about daily customs during the time period.
5,Great Production!,David McCullough once again delivers! A great production which gives us a fabulous insight into our nation's beginnings. Highly recommend this for every American.
5,John Adams,"""John Adams"" is one of the best , if not the BEST Historical Video Presentation to come down the pike in a long time. The casting, acting, wardrobe and photography were SUPERB!The only critizism I would give is the lack of DETAIL in some of the scenes and to increase the length of the video another 2 hours.The packaging of this video is EXCELLENT and has become a HIGHLIGHT of my VIDEO LIBRARY."
5,John Adams cd,"This TV production was amazingly accurate and well done. Paul Giamatti's performance was absolutely flawless. I watched the entire movie twice in three days! All the actors and actresses were chosen perfectly for their parts. The rhetoric between Mr. & Mrs. Adams was great. She really was the amazing woman that was his helpmate. I give this selection the highest rating, and plan on viewing it over and over again."
5,Real History,"These people are real, their intellect amazing, the real ""Adams's Family."" An intimate look at the founding of or country that will change forever your beliefs concerning the founding fathers of our country.Everyman needs an Abigail to ground him. She is the glue that held the Adams family together, the sage John needed to accomplish his great ambitions.If you can only own one series about the beginnings of this country, let it be ""John Adams."""
1,THESE PEOPLE STOLE FROM ME!,i harrassed these people to send me my dvd. it took them three tries and 2 months before i got fed up and decided i wanted my money back. it has been over a month and they lied to me saying my account had been credited in the amount i paid them. THEY LIED! the money never reached my account and now they wont return my emails! THEY STOLE FROM ME!
1,John Adams HBO miniseries,seemybooks2 NEVER SENT THIS ITEM. I sent them a note as Amazon suggested but never got a response.I have read reviews of others who experienced the same disappointment.I am wondering how I can get my money back because this company must have gone out of business.This has been very disappointing as this was my one present for my husband.Thank you.Lelly Smith
1,Phantom Order,"I have heard that John Adams is a marvelous mini-series and wanted to order it for my son's visit Thanksgiving week. Unfortunately, it never arrived. Amazon refunded my money, but I was very disappointed. Better luck next time- first time this ever happened."
1,John Adams or HBO Preview DVD?,Great content except for mandatory movie trailer ads. Get very tired of it. I recommend you wait until reruns on TV and video rather than watch all of the ads.
1,Very Far Left View of Founding Fathers.,"This HBO series depicts George Washington as an idiot. Ben Franklin as a playboy in Paris. John Adams as an angry, frustrated man, poor husband, poor father. I should have not expected historical facts from HBO and Tom Hanks; even most of the players are far left individuals. Will be used to indoctrinate our young children guaranteed. Would not recommend wasting your time on this."
2,DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS SUPPLIER,"This item was ordered on 11-21-08. As of today, 12-24-08, it has not been received. Amazon has credited my payment and I ordered another one directly from Amazon yesterday.Linda"
3,Not as good as the book,"I read the book a few years before seeing the miniseries. I was excited when they came out with the miniseries and was anxious to see it. I was disappointed. The interation between Adams and Jefferson who were good friends until their deaths was not there. The story did not reveal that both Adams and Jefferson died on the same day -- the 4th of July. It did not show that Adams' daughter had a mastectomy without anesthesia, and finally succumbed to breast cancer. I just think for a miniseries, it could have been so much better."
1,Total Distortion of fact,The HBO series John Adams is the grossest distortion of true fact I have ever seen since Mel Gibson's Passion of the Christ. Don't waste your time.
4,John Adams,An outstanding summary of John Adams' life. Only McCullough's book can fill in the gaps the series could not cover. It is the most outstanding mini-series of the last several years.
5,Sure to Win a Carload of Emmies,This series should be required viewing for all Americans. It tells the story of the founding of our country in a profoundly stirring way. It is certain to dominate the awards for such programs.
5,Great gift,"I bought this for my husband as a gift. He never got a chance to view all the episodes on HBO, but of what he did see he enjoyed. Once he opened his gift, he loved it."
4,Great historical television,I loved the mini-series on TV and was glad to find it on dvd. I recommend this historical novel to anyone owning a dvd player.
5,Excellent in every way,The movie is excellent. The service and the price were great. All in all a very good experience. A dependable source for any product.
5,HBO John Adams,Exceptional delivery service (to Australia) and exceptional John Adams series DVDs that we could not stop watching once started! Got some sleep at last!
5,John Adams,"What an amazing series and without commericals this is definitely the way to go. This series was cast really well, great script, scenery, costumes, make up etc. Truly worth the money for a week's entertainment."
2,"Loved the book, hated the series","I loved the book so I was looking forward to the series with great interest, however the writers of the series apparently never read David McCullough's book. John Adams as written by the script writers and played by Paul Giamatti is overly stubborn and vain, yes the real Adams was stubborn and vain but if he was as stubborn as played in the show; nobody would have had worked with him. The series skips over big chunks of Adams' life and areas of historial interest (his renew of his friendship of Jefferson is hardly mention.) instead Giamatti goes around scolding people.One bright spot is Laura Linney's Abigail Adams, it's dead on; from what I have read about old Abby you didn't mess with her or her family."
5,"Seen the first 2 episodes, and am moved.","I have only seen the first two episodes, and have to say that this is so far, a very, very good work. This is not the story of great men being great, it is the story of a human man, with normal flaws and doubts, being thrust into a situation where he, and his fellows, rise to the occasion--even as they wish they did not have to. Even the men who you wind up disliking are not villains--they are people. They have their own thoughts and concerns, and are not ""bad guys"".This is not spectacle. It is not explosions and violent conflict portrayed larger than life. It is, rather, the process by which the Founding Fathers pushed, and drug, each other to recognize the need to break free of the Crown.People have complained about the cinematography. I think all I have seen fits the atmosphere the era quite well.If you like history, or human drama, this one is one to buy. And, HBO is to be commended for brining this story to the screen in this miniseries."
5,History as We Haven't Seen It,"I can hardly wait to own these DVDs! I've watched the HBO series over and over and see or hear something every time that I missed in previous viewings. This series is rich in historical detail, drama, and humor. I can't vouch for the historical accuracy, but I have great respect for David McCullough, on whose book the series is based, and trust that he and the series are true to the...well, the truth. I am grateful to Tom Hanks for his vision and tenacity in bringing these stories to us in such a pleasurable way. Now, how about the Thomas Jefferson story in a similar fashion?"
4,Great Series!,I watched this on HBO and loved it. I purchased the DVD set for my dad for fathers day. He liked it so much he watched the entire series over a weekend. The acting is great and it really follows the biography well. Enjoy!
5,"A ""MUST SEE""","I feel this series should be required viewing in all schools. It would help us remember just how difficult it was to win our freedom, and perhaps we would value it more. Where are the men like these now, when we need them so desperately?"
4,Good series with one crucial miscasting error,"I am not an expert on John Adams and his family, so I will assume that most of the details in this series are historically accurate. For too long, we've had this high-school history view of the founding of our goverment. I've found it interesting to learn that politics then wasn't much different from politics now, with its share of violent arguments and outright backstabbing.However, I believe that the casting of Paul Giamatti in the lead role was a crucial mistake. He simply does not exhibit the emotional range that this character requires, and his expressions seem to range from a befuddled, blank look to a smirk. Laura Linney, an excellent actress, was a fine choice for Abigail, but I've often had the sense that she was holding back so as not to embarrass Giamatti too much. I'm glad that HBO has created this series, and I intend to watch the remaining episodes, but I doubt that I will buy the DVD set."
1,nudity warning,"The movie was entertaining, though I question the validity of some of the events and situations that were depicted. I didn't feel like the founding fathers were treated respectfully by the writers. My main objection, however, is the unnecessary (and I believe inaccurate) full frontal nudity in the tar and feathering scene. And the lengthy, and again very unnecessary, woman's breast scene at the end. I feel it was a thinly-veiled appeal to HBO's baser audience and ruins an otherwise O.K. movie."
1,needs to be rated--not suitable for children,I was disappointed by the level of unnecessary violence and nudity in this DVD. The tar and feather scene is graphic and shows full nudity--despite the fact that historically many tar and feather attacks only involved being stripped to the waste. There were other overly graphic violent scenes that I don't think were necessary to telling the story.
1,disappointed in objectionable material,There were several objectionable parts to this movie. I was really disappointed since I had been able to watch parts of the filming in Williamsburg and was looking forward to seeing this. The book was excellent. Too bad movies never equal the books.
1,john adams dvd,Cannot write a review because I never received the product. I e-mailed the seller but have not received a response !!Henry R Macina
3,A scratched dvd,"I had wanted to see this movie for quite a while and was thrilled to get it at a reasonable price. However, while viewing the second disc, the video began to skip and jump, thus ruining the viewing. I fast forwarded the video until it stoped skipping. I wanted to share this video with my family, but now I am reluctant to."
3,Good Production Values does not Equal Engaging Story,"I realize I am in the minority.The way I approached this series as nothing more than a viewer who loves historical dramas - both true to life and fictional accounts.Well, I was excited when this series came into our house. I was really psyched when I watched the first episode - and then... the second... and ... oh god, now I gotta watch the third... ... do we have to watch the fourth? ...you know, frankly it started to feel like a chore. And I have ""better"" things to do than to torture myself watching Paul Giamatti huffing, puffing, and bugging his eyes out in exasperation for - what is it - 6, 9 hours? - he got a golden GLOBE for that?!?! ... *sigh*"
2,Not a history lesson.,The story of John Adams is a very important part of our heritage as a nation. If you really want to understand this man and this period in our American history you have to read the biography by David McCullough. The HBO series is entertaining but does not capture the essence of 1776 America or the details which John Adams captured in his writings which are featured in the book. I am amazed at the number of people who falsely believe this miniseries serves as a lesson in history. Don't allow your intelligence to be dulled by the director of this film.
2,The true story was not told by this movie,"What's Wrong with HBO's Dramatization of John Adams's Story by Jeremy Stern[...]""In the last episode of HBO's recent and much-lauded miniseries, ""John Adams,"" the aged former president is taken to see artist John Trumbull's enormous new painting, depicting the signing of the Declaration of Independence. Adams scoffs at its distortion of the real event's complexity, warning that it falsifies history for the sake of dramatic presentation. ""Do not,"" he chides the artist, ""let our posterity be deluded with fictions under the guise of poetical or graphical license.""It was a curious admonition for the screenwriters to include, for the HBO series itself does, consistently and often egregiously, exactly what Adams is shown warning against..."""
2,Not for me,I hate to give low points since I know what it takes to make these films. But somehow I wasn't enthused about this film.
5,John Adams HBO miniseries,I totally enjoyed this miniseries. Historically it's accurate. The actors were believable. I recommend this film to history buffs and nonhistory buffs alike.
5,John Adams DVDs,This was very enjoyable. We had watched it on HBO and the purchase from Amazon was a gift for my son and daughter-in-law.
4,Delight and Disappointment,"I enjoyed John Adams by HBO, I like history and I hope HBO's interpretation is close. I felt the actors and actresses did well and portrayed their parts fairly well. I noted what seemed a jump in time with the death of Abigail's daughter and the next scene where all of a sudden Abigail's hair is totally grey a lot of time seemed to have passed. Perhaps I missed something. I also was a bit stunned at the nudity in it. I hope they don't show it in schools. Finally the last cruncher was to see it for $20.00 less in Canada at Best Buy than I paid at Amazon. Up to now I've found Amazon prices the best and lowest and the delivery of the product ,the great way it's packaged,how fast I get it and the whole online experience has been superb. Is it worth it?in the future?"
5,John ADAMS,This series is one of the best things I have ever seen on TV. It brought that very important history alive and it made me appreciate the great contribution of John Adams to our history. He was indeed a great man. The acting was first-rate and the settings were magnificent. I have been thoroughly delighted. The special features were very interesting also.It would be wonderful if more similar movies could be done on America's history.
4,JOHN ADAMS,Enjoyable. Gives the viewer new depth into a time we were unable to share. It provides a history lesson without boredom. The performances by all are to be celebrated.
5,Public School History Filled In,"I was a K-12 student with good attendance, who never fell asleep in class. Nevertheless, ""John Adams"" was a revelation for me. It's not just that it contains information about one person's life and career. The little known facts and stories around our 2nd president, as well as many of his contemporaries [Washington, Franklin, Jefferson, Hancock, etc] bring the birth of our nation to life. ""John Adams"" also debunks some of our nations 'cherry tree type' myths, while bringing the realities of real sacrifice for the sake of freedom to the screen. I recommend ""John Adams"" to teachers for their classrooms, to history buffs, and to anyone who wants to watch an honest-to-gosh 'reality show.'"
5,Gods and Generals vs. John Adams,GREAT! Now I need to read the book. From some of the reviews I hear the book is a lot better so I look forward to it. I can understand people's poor reviews because it wasn't as good as the book. Gods and Generals was a very poor movie compared to Jeff Shaara's book. As for John Adams I'm glad I saw the series first because I think this is how every book should be done! It was a homerun for HBO and I really hope they do spin offs for the other founding fathers.
5,Joh Adams (HBO Miniseries),"Great movie series. Touching love story, great historicaly correct saga. Fantastic acting. Good period costuming. Great casting. All around A1 for those who care for nations history."
2,Item does not include pieces from description,"Item is described as including earring backings, a charm bracelt, cord, among other things. The item was just the book and the shrinky dink paper."
4,A bit of nostaligia,"I bought this as an early holiday gift for my niece who is in second grade. She has a brother in 2nd grade, and sisters in 3rd and 5th grades. When my niece opened the gift, she tossed it aside, having no idea what fun and excitement this brought to me and my siblings growing up. Later, she came to me and asked how you use Shrinky Dinks. Her 2 sisters and brother joined us immediately when they saw how fun it was to watch them shrink. It was a real blast for us all. The only thing is that you have to conserve paper as much as you can b/c there are only 5 sheets of paper. I am already online ordering refills after one use with 4 children."
4,More work than we thought,"This was pretty much what we were looking for, however, it was a little more work than what we thought it would be. Our next task is to find a place to buy replacement shrinky dink sheets...."
2,Not great quality,"After getting the shrinky dinks christmas tree kit, my kids loved it. So I decided to purchase this to make more Shrinky Dinks. But the quality of the shrinky dinks sheets did not compare the to kits. Did the same thing, same length of time in the same oven....I couldn't get them to melt flat like the tree kits one for the life me."
4,Kushlan Kurb Kit,I purchased the kurb kit in addition to a Kushlan concrete mixer. I used it the first weekend after receiving them. I installed curbing around most of my flower beds and capped them with a nice decorative cap stone. The kurb kit is easy to use. I used extra wooden stakes to keep it from bowing out when I poured the concrete. Since that time I purchase 2 additional kits and plan to put curbs around all the beds in my yard. It is a inexpensive way to really dress up your yard.
4,Very easy do-it-yourself opton,"I purchased the Kushlan Concrete Landscape Border Kit almost a year ago and have now started using it to create borders around plants in my Mojave backyard. Borders are very much need to separate rock color and size. I have found this product to be so very easy to set up. About every other night, after getting home from work, I'll wheel out the wheelbarrow and mix two 90 lbs bags or three 60 lbs bags of Ready-Crete, shovel it into the form, smooth it and edge... and voilà! The form is so easy to setup in the soil, especially with a flat square-nosed shovel. Comment prior were made about the flimsiness of the product. I found it to work fine if set in the soil about an inch deep with the excavated soil mounded along the sides of the form for stability.This product is working for me so well, I am purchasing a second one to make the process quicker. Loving the do-it-yourself option!"
4,So easy!,"Ok, if you ever made mudpies as a kid, this thing is for you. This is so simple to use. Carve out the pathway, place you mold and the spacers. Mix the concrete, fill. That's about it. I think the hardest part of this project is making the right mix of water and concrete...I'm getten the hang of it."
1,Poor,"This cribbage set was ridiculously underpar. Extremely cheap and thin wood, I felt like it would snap in my hands. The hinge was loose and badly set, so the 2 halfs didn't line up. Moreover, I bought the exact same set from a retail store, and for some reason it was of much higher quality."
1,Extremely poor quality,"The lowest quality item I have ever received from Amazon. Board is made of cheap, splintering pine. Holes are not neatly drilled. Includes a flimsy deck of playing cards from a never-heard-of Chinese company. Hinge on board is loose. Case's metal accents were scratched. Another fine example of low quality goods coming out of China. Possibly a former display item, as box had clearly been opened before."
3,Good travel cribbage board,"I bought this for a gift this past Christmas. It is not the most durable cribbage board but it works just fine as a fun, portable cribbage board. When the gift was opened, we realized that the board was missing from the case. I contacted the company and they sent out a replacement immediately with no trouble at all. Overall I was pleased."
2,"A reminder of the wretched Leinsdorf, from sooneone who was there","I went regularly to the BSO in the Leinsdorf era, and he was a wretched conductor on the whole. Now that he's long dead, I can almost forget him, until the stiff, unyielding, utterly inert conducting on this CD set reminds me of those awful years. Lucine Amara was dragged in at the last moment as a replacement in the part of Elsa and is quite bad, completely ignorant of Wagner style, too small of voice, etc. Sandor Konya is a joy, however, the ideal Lohengrin. This is his only studio recording of the role that made him famous, but you can find the same sweet-voiced performance on off-labels from live performances."
1,Not Alana Grace - very disappointed,"Not sure if this is Amazon's fault or Import CDs. After doing a search on Amazon for ""Alana Grace"" this CD came up. I ordered it thinking I would receive the Alana Grace CD, but instead received this CD which is by another group named NFD who, unknown to me, has a CD with the same title as the Alana Grace CD. The NFD CD is only three songs and other than the title has nothing in common with the CD I was expecting. Import CD did do a good job of shipping this very promptly. Hopefully Amazon will improve its searches and not let this kind of thing happen again. Definitely disappointed."
1,This Break the Silence album is NOT ALANA GRACE,"I looked at the product and it was definitely NOT the Break the Silence album from Alana Grace. This album is from another group. Please go to the [...] website to see the cover of the album put out by Alana Grace. It has her face on it, not the image pictured on this page.Break The Silence"
2,Unsuccessful,"Two wonderful pianists whose discs are often magnificent, they seem to have got it pretty wrong here. With the exception of the Scriabin, they play arrangements of orchestral works (ballets etc.) which to my ears sound ludicrous sheared of the orchestral colours. If you want these pianists at their best, get other discs lke their fantastic Gershwin series, a Debussy disc and even some fun Spanish fare. If you want these works, get discs of the orchestral versions. In short, skip this disc."
2,not for relaxation,"I am the manager of a large day spa. We are constantly searching for music to bring our guests to a higher level of relaxation. Only a small portion of this CD is meant for peaceful moments. The majority is lively, fast tempo music."
4,a fantastic read,"I read it, I loved it, I'll read it again. It's a keeper on my book shelf. The author outdid herself, considering the length of the book."
5,Pablo Cruise fans - Take Note,"This is an outstanding album of original songs by Kapono Beamer with vocals by Dave Jenkins, lead singer of Pablo Cruise in the 70's and 80's. Jenkins sang with the group Southern Pacific for a couple of years in the late 80's. This is a breezy Hawaiian style pop-rock album, with lots of the Pablo Cruise style and sound mixed in."
2,"stencils, shmencils","Lovely photographs. Problem is the title suggests it is a book of stencils, or so I assumed: ""creative ideas for applying patterns....."" Just lots of pretty photos. Returned it, the only purchase I ever have returned to Amazon, and I am a frequent buyer. Now I am looking for a book of stencils from which I can make templates to ""apply patterns..."""
4,instrumental for massage,I enjoy listening to this CD but I also realize that not all will want to listen to Asian music incorporating the harp.
3,"not great, not bad","Stephen King has some comments on the back of this book and he does as good a job of describing it as I ever could - he calls it ""Part detective story, part ghost story, part Southern gothic."" That pretty much describes it."
5,Haunting,"This book gave me chills after finishing it. I've read many authors, but no one ever could deliver such shocking blows to my stomach the way Woods does."
2,Not My Favorite Woods' Novel At All!,"I did not think that ""Under The Lake"" lived up to the other novels by Stuart Woods. Maybe it was because Stone Barrington wasn't in them. I actually thought the plot was strange and did not turn out all too well. My favorites are Worst Fears Realized and Orchid Beach. If you want a Stuart Woods' novel, don't pick this one."
3,book review,Very interesting book that keeps one reading until the solution of the story. It had been recommended to me by friends. They were correct. I did enjoy the story.
3,Not his best and not his worst.,"This book kept me interested until the end, but it did not have the punch like ""Heat"" did. The characters were interesting and the plot was good. Although the ending was pretty good, I felt like the story was not complete like some of his other novels."
3,OK...COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER....,"I am not saying in the least that I did NOT like this book..in fact, I did. The problem was that I thought the plot to be way too unbeievable...and it really was not formed... I mean a town under a lake?!?!? To put it bluntly...it was weird!!! As a matter of fact, after reading this book, at first I was hesitant to read another one of Mr. Wood's books, but since I did not hate this book, I decided to give him another one of his books a try. Hopefully it works out....if not oh well...nothing lost...nothing gained."
3,Under my expectations,"Stewart Woods has written some of the best suspense books I have ever had the pleasure of reading. They are the kind f books that tend to stay with you long after you have finished them. I'm afraid though, try as I might, this one just didn't measure up. The premise was interesting and the storyline moved along, but I felt at times it was choppy and disconnected and just didn't reflect the talent you usually find glaringly apparent in other novels by this author. The plot was unbelievable at times even for a fictional story. For me, this one just fell flat. There is a quote on the front of the book from Stephen King stating this book ""scared the living Hell out of him,"" either he spooks easier than we thought or he owed the publishing house for this book a favor. It was comical at times, frustrating in parts and even slow at some points, but it was anything but scary."
3,A Very Different Style ...,"I think I have read all of Stuart Woods books and this one is very different in style - not at all like those about Stone Barrington or Wood's other regular characters. It is still quite a good read, although the plot is a bit far-fetched at times. You have to remind yourself that the story is written as if it was 40 years ago."
5,Truly A Page Turner...,"I must say it was a page turner... though the quote of Steven King saying it was scary as hell I don't agree with. It was scary... to a point and well written and you really couldn't put it down. But it wasn't on you can't read late at night. But don't let that put your hopes down! It is really one of the greatest books I've read! Its one of those books where the character doesn't know what has happened til the end. And the best part is that you are put in the characters position! Not one of those books where you know but they don't... You don't know either which really makes it a great book. Read it, like it, review it, read it again! This has really brought to my attention a new author to read."
4,Terrific Southern Gothic!,"Stuart Woods captures the essence of the Southern Gothic in thisthriller. Based on the true story of a Northeast Georgia town purchased by a large power company and covered with an upscale lake community, Woods spins mystery, romance, and terror into this tale. It is a fast-moving and entertaining treat!"
5,Best Book I've Ever Read,"I just finished the book five minutes ago. It combines mystery and horror into one of the scariest and most suspenseful books I've ever read. There are all sorts of unanticipated plot turns that surprised the hell out of me. Tfe most fascinating thing about the book is that the author, Stuart Woods, managed to put closure on all the sub-plots the book explored. It's a superb piece of literature."
5,A real thriller,Stuart Woods has proved once again to be a great mystery writer. This book will keep you guessing to the very end. Make sure you are not in the house alone when you read it!!!
5,Surprise Ending,Love Stuart Woods!! One of my Favorite authors. I read it in one day since I could not put it down.
2,A Disappointing Purchase,"This tea consists of Broken Orange Pekoe grade, at best. It may be closer to a fanning grade. On the whole, it's not the quality of tea I prefer or even what I expected from TofH, given that I enjoy their tea bags (when I have to drink tea made from tea bags).BTW, I'd rate this 2 1/2 stars, but that's not a option."
1,Disappointing tea purchase,"Complete bag of tea was the ""dregs"" (small pieces of the tea leaf) found at the bottom of a container of tea."
3,"Good protein, bad non-taste","There is no question the isolate protein is of high quality. However, the promise of tasting like tapioca pudding is hugely over rated. It hardly smells of tapioca and tastes like...nothing. So its ablity to mask the taste of other additives is non-existant. Great buy for the protein, but hard to swallow in practice."
5,BOO,I use the tappioca flavor and it is the only protein supplement that I can mix with a few ounces of water and down the hatch. No after taste. Just a quick meal and off to what ever hte day has to offer. You don't need to make it into a 5 or 6 hundred calories. I use about 3 oz. water and use to wash down my vitamins. I can only use the Isolate of this product.
3,Strong Album,"Good album from a pretty good band. Give it a chance - lead has begun to shed his buckley-ish carbon copy voice and music has matured, with the obvious objective of shedding the travis/doves/coldplay/etc/etc/etc machines."
5,Special in the Best Sense of the Word,"If I had to pick only a handful of discs to single out as being of extreme worth to me personally - this would be one of them. There are just some works out there where the composer was inspired to record something truly extraordinary. This is one such work and this recording is the best that I know of. I have also spent a lot of time with the Fournet, Rotterdam recordingFauré: Requiem; Pavane; Pelléas et Mélisande. And while I think that is a fine recording, this ASMF recording with Marriner is a cut above. The playing is sensuous and refined, the tempos are perfect to convey the feeling of the music. This recording has lifted me up at some very low times in my life, and never ceases to convey power, wonder, and awe."
1,Don't waste your money,"I bought this little player when we were in the process of moving across country. I wanted an MP3 player to use in the car since I would be driving it solo. It worked fine for about 11 months. Then one afternoon at the gym it winked off and would never turn on again. I did nothing to it to cause a failure. I charged it as the manual stated but it gave out with no warning.I would not waste my money on an RCA product like this. While I felt it was inexpensive I didn't expect an RCA product to be cheap and shoddy. That's just what this player is - cheap. If you're looking for something that is going to last more than a year, save up your money and invest in a quality MP3 product. This is definitely a case of you get what you pay for and for this player that's very little."
3,it's kind crappy,"It didn't work right out the box-I truly thought it was defective, I constantly have to press the reset button so I carry a paper clip around on it, trying to find a certain song on it is annoying, I have almost 400 songs and I'm out of space, the battery drains all the time even when it is off...on the plus...the ear buds are wonderful! very comfortable!! And I have senstive ears and can't handle most headphones. The sound is good, The screen is very nice to look at, very colorful....but overall, I cuss at it more than I praise it."
1,peice of junk,"This player didn't last 6 months. The jack where you put the earphones in is messed up and now plays only static. The jack also is where you are suppose to power it up- it is suppose to power up automatically- it stoped doing that. Finally, when it was working it took about 10 minutes to load and another 3 minutes everytime you wanted to search for a particular song. Not a happy customer.Rca M4002 Opal Series Mp3 Player With 1.5-Inch Oled (2 Gb)"
2,"Meh, I've seen worse","The best thing I can say about this player is that the ear-buds that come with the unit are among the best I have ever used. The sound is decent quality and I like the size. However, the firmware is terrible and don't plan on creating playlists with it. The most annoying thing about it, however, is the fact that you can't change the song without going all the way back the beginning of the menu. I can honestly say I hate this thing, but incredibly, I've seen worse."
1,GET YOUR DRILLBIT READY,Supposedly this was supposed to fit a 2005 Ford Expedition XLT without having to custom drill. It does not. The holes on the underside do not even come close to matching up. What a joke. No wonder it was only $41 dollars.
2,great cover...but only one,"picture shows two....you only get one...not such a great buy, but it does work and look good on the warn connector"
1,A major disappointment.,"I bought this recording based on the musical selections (some of my favorites) and the reputation of Gardiner. I am sorry to say that I was sorely disappointed. The recording lacked the clarity one would expect from a CD. The choral singing lacked the dynamic sensitivity I would have expected and the diction was very poor, particularly the German."
5,Good book,This is a good book about a future war with N. Korea. Good book if you like action. Worth your money
2,A weak version of Red Phoenix and Team Yankee,"Because Red Phoenix did such an excellent job describing a second Korean War, the author needed a home run to make the book worthwhile. Unfortunately, the pacing of the book and character development was weak. Although the description of the updated M1s was interesting, the M1 battle scenes lacked drama because the NK equipment couldn't stand up to it."
2,just another war story,Never really grabbed me. The North Koreans attack and are beaten off by the good guys.
2,Shallow recruiting document,"Perhaps active duty authors should not write fiction - all the Americans are heroic, intelligent multi-cultural two dimesional carboard cut-outs. The North Koreans and reporter were photocopied from the John Wayne movie - The Green Berets. The writing style is dry and unimpressive. The only interesting part of the novel is the description of how the tank works. Not a very good contribution to the military action genre."
5,A great read,"I finished PL this weekend and thoroughly enjoyed the book. It is written in the style of Red Storm Rising, giving the reader the view from both foes as well up and down the chain of command. The technical descriptions of both sides weapons systems was especially interesting. I enjoyed the character development it was crisp, clean and believable. The pace is fast and the plot is easy to follow.I think I would have enjoyed it even more if Antal took it a step further and included what was happening in Washington, Moscow and other capitals. Of course the book works very well as is. Antal has the potential to be the next Tom Clancy."
5,Great Ear Candy,"This CD combines the the deeply colorful and soulful Hammond B3 organ of Joey D., guitar master Pat Martino, sax player Gary Bartz, Papa Defrancesco and others. This is one of Joey's best. . This is one of several Joey DeFrancesco's CD's that I am proud to have in my collection. Add it to yours, you will not be dissapointed."
2,Adept though lifeless,"2 1/2A tamer disc of standardized fare exploits Defrancesco's Hammond sound without hardly digging into the ferocious solo work he is known for, B&B; should primarily appeal to those not invested in the artist's adventurous side."
4,Intoxicating Fragrance,"This was the first time I had purchased a Crabtree and Evelyn product, and I was quite pleased. The quality is so much higher than other bath and body products I have found at drugstores/mass merchandisers. The Sonoma Valley fragrance is warm and intoxicating - I loved it! The scent was still noticeable hours after using the silky smooth lotion. I felt as if I were being pampered all day. The only drawback was that the price was rather steep. I probably would not have purchased this for myself if I hadn't had an Amazon gift certificate! But I would definitely recommend this as a lovely gift for a special person."
5,All I can say is WOW!,"I have bought lofty amounts of music from amazon and others spaning many genres but never compelled to write a review as much as I was for ""what love is"". What an inspiration to the music world, Erin is certainly at another level from what is available with todays young jazz singers. Her voice will amaze and seduce you simultaneously. Get this recording you will not be disappointed, only hope she continues on her quest and brings us more superb jazz vocals."
1,Very Displeased,"I bought this CD player because I was going a trip and wanted music to listen to, instead I got a battery eating, skip machine.The CD player skips a lot if you're moving. Basically the only time that it doesn't skip is when it's perfectly still. Even bumping the table causes it to skip.Additionally, this CD player went through four cds and just as many batteries. It devours batteries and frankly is a waste of money. I plan to save my money so that I can invest a good CD player despite a higher price."
4,No Room in the Ring,"Hamish MacBeth is challenged to a wrestling match, which leads the citizens of Lochdubh to put their money on their favorite policeman. Macho Man is rumored to be laying claim to local wives, his tough guy personality is backed up by insults, which erupt in fights which Hamish has to quell.When Macho Man turns up dead, no one is sorry except Hamish who must resort to late night raids on the police station files to find a killer.Hamish is always in trouble and we love him for it.Nash Black, author of WRITING AS A SMALL BUSINESS and SINS OF THE FATHERS."
2,Death of a Formulaic Detective,I discovered M C Beaton in Netflix with Hamish MacBeth which is a great series. At first the novels were delightful and I read about six before her repeat of whole sections of text became annoying. I gave up and went back to the more cerebral Elizabeth George and Henkel Manning. Excellent for a few reads though.
3,A Good Quick Read,"I found this an easy novel to read. Entertaining even though I rather figured out the villan(s) before the final page, which is a coup for me. But definetly a fun novel to read when your head space doesn't allow you room to get mired down in too much complexity."
2,"Loosely written, but some interesting new angles.","I thought this book gave me some interesting things to contemplate regarding life, and why man has created ""God"" to protect himself from the ability to forsee his own death. However, most of it seems written in a very sketchy manner that makes me feel that at least half of the assertions are not well founded or researched. Not that I've bothered to follow them up myself.I also found the discussion of germs and their competition for survival very interesting and insightful to human lives in general.I just wish he had written the book in a more controlled, directed, and researched manner. It left me with tons more questions than it answered completely.I hope someone has written a book that elaborates on these topics as they relate to human life and everyday living. But it was interesting."
5,Works as advertised,I use the Tripp Lite APSRM4 as a remote battery and function monitor and controller for a Trip Lite 750W inverter in my camper. It has nice looking face plate which provides several mounting options. The photograph of the unit is accurate. I'm pleased with it and would recommend it to others.
5,Outstanding Rachmaninov 1st and 2nd from a little known artist,"I couldn't agree more with the previous reviewer. These hard to find recordings by german born, russian trained pianist Peter Rösel make some of the strongest cases for the more challenging 1st and 4th concertos especially. He creates a tremendous sound from the piano without it sounding at all clangy. There is ample virtuosity accompanied by interpretive sensitivity and subtle rubato. Tempos are not so fast allowing for much expression of nuance. Grab both this and the CD of the 3rd and 4th concertos if you can find them. The 1982 sound is excellent as is the accompaniment of Kurt Sänderling and the Deutsch Sinfonie. I also own excellent recordings by Janis/Reiner and Janis/Kondrashin of the 1st and Thibaudet/Ashkenazy, Hough/Litton & Cliburn/Reiner of the 2nd finding these Berlin classics recordings to be fully competitive."
4,Eddie is still Shakin',"This Eddie Money DVD is exactly what I expected it to be. An aging rock n roller still putting the youngsters to shame and doing the classic Money-Medleys in a style all his own. The crowd is enthusiastic and Eddie is giving them what they want. We all get older and Eddie has as well. He looks comparable to his age and he cranks out some super hits in classic fashion. This guy comes from the ranks of the rock stars who fought their way to the top. Well, Eddie hasn't come down yet!!!!!"
3,"good track list, terrible audience","I don't think I have ever seen an audience this bad, ever! Eddie is rockin and still capable after all these years, and the band is tight, But its simply painful to watch eddie lean into the crowd with the MIC and get no response over and over. Good track listing, trinidad is a treat, but WOW what a difference a lively crowd makes. only for die-hard eddie money fans!!"
4,"Weird, but pretty good.","The audio and video are marginal on this DVD. Eddie can still bring it, and the concert set list contains his better songs. Weird choice for a venue. Almost looks like a high school stage in a gym or something."
4,Good OLD EDDIE,"this is a good show from Eddie All the hits are here good set up to only thing I would like to have seen is Ronnie show up to back up Eddie on Take me home tonight ,but it is a good show from Eddie !"
5,Go find Manville,"This is a fun CD, not the standard rock n roll. The songs are thoughtful and creative. Every girl needs to find her way to Manville!"
2,"Nice, but only covers the northern half","Nice, but it only covers the northern half of the Inside Passage, from Ketchikan to Juneau/Skagway. The Inside Passage starts at Horseshoe Bay Ferry Terminal in West Vancouver and includes the Sunshine Coast, the Bella Coola fjiord region and -- as a must see side trip -- the Queen Charlottes.Book expropriates a term (US cultural imperialism at work again)"
5,I love historical fiction about regency England.,"I had occasion to be in the hospital for surgery and had to bethere for eleven days.I had fortunately brought along short stories of the regency period;I found it easier at that time to concentrate on the stories, ratherthan the pain and discomfort of the effects of the surgery.Fortunately, while I am still not what I used to be, I still amthe most dedicated book lover I know.I feel very fortunate to be able to buy books that are affordableand available.As for this particular book, I enjoy all the stories, especiallythe ones about families.Helen Wilcox"
5,The Rarest of them all.,"As a card collector myself, the original first edition Blue Eyes White Dragon is a great very very rare Dragon card that has collector and fans on their knees trying to get this card. Since it is out of print, this card makes it worth to buy. The price that i would pay for this card new is around 10.00 or 20.00 dollars depending on the condition it is in. I bought 3 played edition of this card and they are used badly, but buying them new now that is hard to find. If you can get this card new or even in mint condition for a valued price then you should totally get it.Don't hesitate to get this super rare dragon. Get it before it's gone for good."
5,Not mint at all,"It says its straight out of the starter deck, but when I received mine, it had scratches, a big wrinkle on the back, and the top was splitting. I love Blue eyes white dragon, that's why I ordered my own, but it was in pretty beat up to be ""from the package"" I recommend getting this card from somewhere else. The card itself is great, but the condition was bad."
1,Not As Advertised,This is not the OST from Cincinatti Kid. It sounds like a bunch of HS kids screwing around. Terrible!
5,Food you can feel good about,"This is the only brand of boxed macaroni and cheese that I will serve to my five year old and this is the only one she will eat. First of all, the ingredient list speaks for itself. It's made from only a small handful of all natural ingredients (none of those obscure, unpronounceable ingredients!) and you can feel good about giving it to your children (and to yourself as well!). Not only is it a much healthier choice than most other boxed mac and cheese dinners, but it tastes great, too! Perfectly cheesy and delicious. Our little girl just loves it and so do we! It's not too difficult to prepare either and it's one of those last minute, throw-togethers on busy days that you can count on. Stock your pantry shelf with Annie's..you won't be sorry."
2,Lame,I can't believe the positive reviews for this stuff. We got a case of it at a wholesale club thinking it would be good. We have made 4 boxes of it and stinks!. The sauce is runny and there isn't nearly enough cheese.
5,The best spackle I ever received...,"Another astute reviewer below referred to the ""chalky"" consistency of this ""homegrown"" brand of mac and cheese. Casting aside the ""growing"" abilities of mac and cheese for a moment, let me say that that reviewer was being extremely gracious and diplomatic. To call this ""chalky"" is call Metamucil, well, ""grainy."" It's the understatement of understatements.Rather than use this for its intended purpose...which I truly fear for those who actually ingest this substance...I noticed how well it clumped and gumped up together. Taking it out to a storage shed with interior yellowish walls, I began hoisting a putty knife to this travesty of a ""pasta"" and...lo and behold...it plugged up holes in the best way possible. Now, slap a touch up of paint over it...voila. Thank's Annie's.So...as a food-substance....Jesus, Joseph and Mary, I would have to pass. But, as an industrial-strength spackle or bonding-agent...go for it."
3,"Review of the documentary ""God in America""","It seemed to start out okay, but around the midpoint, the program really strayed from my concept of God in America to other ""social"" concerns which I associate more with politics than with God."
2,Don't but THIS dvd buy all the other ONES!!!,"The only reason I gave my favorite anime 2 stars was becuase this has the first two episodes... this is a test drive... DON'T BUY THIS!!! BUY ALL THE OTHER DVDS OF UTENA!!!!!!!I have all the Utena DVD's; all 39 episdoes and let me just say, this anime is AMAZING!! It is by-far my favorite anime... If you were debating over wheter to get this anime or not, get it. It's fabulous!! BUY IT NOW!!"
4,Good but can use some work,"Revolutionary Girl Utena is about a young girl, who by the way is quite the tomboy, So when she swicthes to a school where the students decide things with they swords. The action scenes are great, the animation is about over average, however thats made up with the story. Its very easy to understand to an open mind, remember that."
1,Truth must be the norm for unity,"This book is full of historical inaccuracy, false dichotomy, misrepresentation of the Bible, and misrepresentation of Catholic teaching. Furthermore, it ignores many differences between major Protestant groups to the point of misrepresenting Protestantism. If Protestants and Catholics are ever to be reunited in faith, that faith must be based on truth. Don't waste your money on this one."
1,Pope Fiction,"As a former conservative Evangelical who found himself slowly, by the grace of God led to full communion with the Catholic Church, I plead with any Protestant considering this book as a source of insight into Catholicism to look elsewhere. It is a shame and disservice to the Gospel of Christ.Even if you can't see Catholics are your brothers in Christ (though we see you in that way), it's important to understand what they truly believe. You'll find nothing here but distortions, bad scholarship or worse. Lies serve only father of lies.Even if you desire nothing but material to oppose us, read one of the Protestant converts to Catholicism like Scott Hahn (""Rome Sweet Home""), Mark Shea (""By what Authority?""), or Karl Keating (""Catholicism and Fundamentalism""). At least then you can oppose true Catholicism and not this fiction created by Ankerberg and Weldon."
1,pick another please?,"it is just silly to me when i think of all the debate against who is right. Does God really care who does what as long as you BELIEVE it doesn't matter!!! I was a devout protestant (yay United Methodists) until recently when i converted to Catholicism. this book gave me little insight on true Catholicism, but merely gave the stereotypes which have been ingrained in our protestant minds throughout our lives. It is sad to see that they dont belong, but i have yet to meet a catholic who hates protestants as much as i have met protestants who are disgusted by the stereotype of catholicism which they arent even familiar. choose another book"
2,Mainly the characters,"Really cool idea, and parts of the story was enjoyable, but the main problem I had was with the characters. They were too unbelievable for me; they accepted too quickly with what was going on, and were ready to believe anything. There were other problems I had with the story that I couldn't put my finger on, but it just rang wrong."
1,Well written bad book,"Abbey and the rest of the people in this book are just depressing souls with depressing lives, uninteresting to read about. The alien plot is dull and extremely unoriginal. Kenyon's NA characters are stereotypical in a very unflattering way. I struggled to find anything of merit about Leap Point.The sad thing is that Kenyon's writing is good, she just has poor characters set in lousy stories. At least Seeds of Time was so bad it was funny. Leap Point is just bad."
2,Like a bad music video,"I couldn't read the whole thing, but wrestled through more than half of it. There is gratuitous violence, child pornography, and I found the characters to be unbelievable in their intentions and attitudes. This one goes under the heading ""trashy science fiction with no redeeming value."""
1,Incomplete material,"The spiral bound copy apparently comes in two volumes. This is not mentioned in the listing in Amazon.com. I received Volume I only in my order. Amazon.com is now looking into the problem, I hope."
4,Pleasantly Suprised...,"""Sweethearts"" was no comedy. Oddly I wasn't feeling comical when I popped it in. And what I found, was a wildly romantic drama. It was quite a twist from Janeane's normal roles. Sure, she was still dark and jaded, but there was something edgier about her performance in this film. Don't watch it alone. Or when you are really hyped about something. Take the time to watch it carefully, because it is enjoyable and deep."
1,NOT the Janeane Garafolo movie!,"Please look carefully at the director's name before buying. This Paul Thomas movie is actually an adult movie produced by Vivid and not a very good one at that. Luckily I only spent 5 bucks buying a used version and not $69. Oops! The Janeane Garafolo movie, Sweethearts, is directed by Aleks Horvat and it's almost impossible to find since it was never released."
4,Good movie with great soundtrack,"This movie was interesting with a very surprise ending. i had some trouble believing that the two lead characters created such an intense bond so quickly but hey, it's just a movie i guess. anyways, i'd recommend it, but it's definitely a darker film, not something to watch if you're looking for a laugh."
5,A great movie! But they will mislead you...,"For some bizarre reason, this movie is classified either as a comedy or a romantic comedy everywhere you look. It's not, believe me! It's surprisingly sad. If anything, I'd put it under drama.Without giving anything away, I'll tell you: don't watch this movie if you're prone to depression at all. It's great for wallowing while eating a pint of Ben & Jerry's though :-)"
4,An amazing Janeane Garofalo film,"This movie is a must see for any Janeane fan. The mood is very sad and dark, but this is a film that will stay in your mind for a very long time. Janeane's character is amazing."
5,impressive performance by Janeane Garofalo,"Any bona fide fan of Janeane Garofalo will appreciate this film. Garofalo gives a sterling performance. Mitch Rouse is first-rate. Margaret Cho exhibits a restive manner that is welcomed and essential to the story. This edgy film is sensitive, moody, emotional, stormy, and passionate, but exhilarating. I have seen it four times--each time when I've been in a very good mood. This is not a discouraging film. Watch it in appreciation of the talent of Garofalo, Rouse, and Cho."
1,Less than one star,"Five stars? Give me a break! The quality and content of this film had me believing that it could be no more than a junior high school production. The only thing sensitive about this film were my sides after I got through laughing. The acting was unbearable. The dialogue was lacking. Also, given the seriousness of manic depression and the options that are available for helping individuals stricken with this disorder-- the personal ads along with viewing this film about equal the very last resort...short of suicide. Don't ever waste your money purchasing this film. If you must- Rent it-and that only out of curiousity!"
5,Poor Old Lu's at the epitome of their career,"Sin is Poor Old Lu at the peak of their potential, not quite as dark and sad as 8th Wonder, and remarkably mature for a sophmore album. This is Poor Old Lu's most acessible album. Oh.. the album itself is an excellent work from a Seattle band that sounds nothing like Nirvana; a truly alternative album."
5,in my humble opinion,"This is my favorite album of all time as performed by my favorite band of all time. Tight, clean production, matched with strong hooks and introspective lyrics make this a must have for anyone who has ever wanted to think while they rock. Buy it if you treasure what the early 90's contributed to the growth and maturity of alternative music. A groundbreaker, to be sure."
5,You really need this cd if you don't have it.,"Poor Old Lu is by far one of the best, most unrecognized bands of the whole alternative era. Their unparalleled song writing especialy shines on Sin, their sophomore release through Alarma records. This is by far one of the most complete recordings of one of the most diverse bands of this decade. It is a must for fans of good, emotion filled, gimic free music. You will be touched by the honesty and depth of Scott Hunter's lyrics. And Aaron Sprinkle's melodies and leads will make you want to learn to play guitar. Get this cd, you'll look at music differently."
2,"love the tracks, but CD didnt sound authentic","I lost my original copy so found a cheap deal and purchased.It does the job, but clearly this is 2nd-hand audio. Not close to original trebile and quality when you listenToo bad.Great mixes of songs that I love (running water, human spirit, great classic trance songs)cd=4.5 starsquality=1 star"
3,"Some sex, some money and mortal danger","Some sex, some money and mortal danger represent a story of Jewish counterfeiters of Auschwitz.Well, the most inconvincible moment is an ungrounded hatred to a native country by refusing to speak semi-native Russian but German only a major character-""world No1 counterfeiter"" demonstrated, having escaped the Stalin USSR for free Germany to only find a death and distraction of own and loving lives in then Europe.It is a much better movie than a musical ""Life Is Beautiful"", anyway."
1,counterfeiters dvd,"it is a very good movie. but the problem is,the one i ordered from amazon,cannot be played. some kind of restruction in my area. why do they even sell it. the info didn:t give any clue that it could not be played in some areas. so of course i had to send it back.. i ordered from another place and it is fine.i have no complaint with amazon,they returned my money and even the return postage.."
2,Bad video ...,"The film is just interesting, but the video quality is really bad to a DVD. I have watched films in blu-ray and can't look anymore to these things !!! Stop making DVDs !!!"
1,Wow what an amazing preview! I learned nothing.,"I was riveted. A man walks along a beach, up a boardwalk and into a hotel. The tension was killing me, I mean, was he there to find a spy, the woman of his dreams, or to work on the plumbing? Those not wanting to risk renting the movie based only on this preview will never know. I can live with that."
4,The Counterfeiters,This was an excellent movie but would have been more interesting to me if they hadn't added the fictional hollywood type stuff.
1,Warning---dreadful job on subtitles,"I was prepared to like this movie and I did like the cinematography and acting of the first 20 minutes I saw. However, I stopped watching because I was so frustrated by subtitles being provided for only every 4th or 5th spoken sentence. If you aren't fluent in either German or French you will miss most of the dialogue in the movie. The producers of The Counterfeiters show little respect for their own film if they think the entirety of the dialogue is so unimportant a viewer doesn't need to know all of it. Not to mention little respect for me as a viewer."
4,"Close to perfection, amazing nonetheless","It's interesting to see how in times of despair, comradry fails. A film about concentration camps with the most interesting of characters playing the lead. This film is more about counterfeiting and proposes a great reason Germany dominated the war. They counterfeited British currency to four times the actual worth and had in mind to do the same with the Dollar. What just happens then is a never heard before story of the world's history. Strongly recommended film. The Counterfeiters did something I never thought it would from the off set. Highly recommended. It's like the Pianist with not as much as emotion."
3,"Riveting movie, but...........................","This was a riveting movie. The will to live and survive cast the tormnetors and the tormented in the same boat.But the fragmented English subtiles spoils. Whoever did them did not know Englsh or was a sleep at the wheel. Many portions are without substitles. When they do appear, they are in bits and pieces, making them meaningless, ruining the enjoyment of the film.Sellers should check out the DVD instead of making customers the quailty controllers."
3,2.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:A disappointing film that fails to properly address the moral questions it raises and comes complete with several moments which reek of artifice (as when the counterfeiters manage to replicate the dollar just in time to save their comrades' lives), The Counterfeiters is a rather mediocre film which pales in comparison to Tim Blake Nelson's The Grey Zone."
4,A FEW NOTCHES DOWN FROM SCHINDLER'S LIST,"Yes, it's foreign but stick with it. There have been a lot of concentration camp/WWII pictures in the last decade or so but most of them don't hold a candle to ESCAPE FROM SOBIBOR or SCHINDLER'S LIST. I'm not sure if this film matches either but it arguably comes closer than most. Our main character and his prison comrades fight desperately to avoid being shipped to concentration camps where they will be gassed by creating counterfeit money for Nazi Germany which is then funneled into these enemy countries in the hopes of damaging the economies of England and the USA. Based on historical facts and a real to God operation plan and name. WHEN WATCHED: July to September (on and off for a variety of reasons); MY GRADE: B plus."
4,Excellent movie about an interesting true story.,"This is a pretty interesting movie. It is based on a true story. At times, especially at the beginning, it seems to jump quickly over events. It takes a little to get into the flow of the movie and feel comfortable with who the characters are. The end of the movie is a bit abrupt also. You aren't quite sure what happened to some of the main characters between the last days of the war and the ending where the main character is in a Casino in Monaco. In spite of these drawbacks, this is an interesting movie that makes you want to go out and learn more about the events it was based on."
4,"Wow, a piece of untold history, until now",the movie focuses on a true piece of nazi's and jewish history during the second WW. The acting was excellent that portrayed a group of men who became part of the nazi's funding plan by forging the english pounds and other documents like passports. Although the story is based in the concentration camp and in places the story took some gruelsome turns; it was another sad protrayal of human behavior and yet the human spirit to come through all of it. A truely remarkable movie.
3,Not as good as I expect,"This book gives a good introduciton to the concept of mediation, but that's probably that's all it is.This book spells out the benfits of mediation, and reasons for it. However it does not teach one how to be a successful mediator.For somebody who is completely new to the concept of mediation, this may be a good book to start.To those who have read this book and want to get to know more about the subject, I recommend them to read ""Getting Past No"", another book by Ury."
4,Great...just one flaw.,Nice design and great pepper mill! The only thing is that - considering its size - it does not actually hold that much pepper and it needs to be refilled more often than I thought. I would still recommend it!
2,Nothing Special,"While the graphics are amazing on the entrances, everything else seems to be over the top. Like Raw and Raw 2, the look of the wrestlers and the entrances are the only things that seem to be concentrated on, nothing else. The wrestling is crazy and boring, and the commentary and music is almost all copied and pasted from Smackdown vs. Raw. Studio Gigante, the new developers are not impressive on their first outing but who knows, maybe they will improve over time."
1,"Why THQ, why?","WHy THQ, why? After playing this game, i have come to the conclusion that this game is probobly worse then the original Raw for Xbox. I will make this review in PRO/CON format as usual.Pro:1.Voice over2.Graphics are pretty good in terms of character models3. Blood is realistic lookingCon:1.Tons of glitches2.Game freezes often3.Career mode is way to easy to beat4. Commentators repeat themselves way to much5. Roster is to small (Under 45 superstars)6. Limited gametypes (NO hardcore, WHAT?!?!)7. Put them in a submission 8 times in a row and you've won.8. Unbalanced difficulty levelsAs you can see, i would not spend 50 dollars on this game if i were you."
3,Not THAT bad,"Ok, so it's not a great game. Yes there are a few glitches, but the biggies were fixed with the online update patch from THQ. The gameplay just takes some getting used to and once you get it, it's actually pretty fun. Great graphics, decent gameplay, and xbox live. At least rent it before you completely black ball it."
2,Do not buy,"This game is pretty bad...the graphics are nice, the character models are amazing, but thats about it. The load times are ridiculous,and the storyline in the career mode is boring. You have to win every match for your career to continue on unlike Smackdown vs Raw where you can lose a match and continue on. The storyline isn't open ended so it becomes boring really quick. The music is the same from Smackdown vs Raw, and so is the commentary. All in all this game blows, just rent it because after an hour or so you'll wanna throw it in the garbage."
1,WWE WrestleMania 21-Worst game....evr?,"Look XBox has NO decent wrestling game its clear that THQ and even WWE don`t give a damn about XBox,its all about PS2 and its ultra SmackDown! series.Remember how crap WWF RAW was,lame graphics,outdated roster no special matches,Not even the bloody cage match!WWE RAW 2 was OK,But it was so outshined by HCTP and WMXIX that the game just looked so dull,Plus they left over some cons from the original game.WWE WrestleMania 21 is purhaps the worst wrestling game this gen after WWF RAW,The online mode sucks,Glitches glitches,hype and did i say gliches yet?So steer clear of any WWE game that comes out on XBox and probably XBox 360 as THQ,Yukes and WWE just don`t give a damn about u guys.I say WWE,because WWE on their show usually put the latest WWE game on its commercial,But apart from once or twice,i`ve never seen an XBox WWE game broadcasted."
1,TIME TO PLAY THE GAME...,"...just not this one! Vince McMahon is rolling over in his grave (and he ain't dead yet) at the flaming turd that is Wrestlemania XXI.Is it this hard to make a good wrestling game for the Xbox? The shelf life of this system is winding down with the Xbox 360 around the corner and we, the fans, haven't gotten one...ONE!!!!...good wrestling game.How bad is this game? Let's just say that in some third world countries you could be dragged out into the streets and have your house destroyed if you even thought of releasing a game this bad.Let's go to the score card:-""Iffy"" (at best) LIVE play.-Horrendous controls.-The game locks up! (even my old Nintendo didn't do that)-Create a wrestler is limited (it's a step down from RAW 2)-I could go on all day...but that's not how I roll.SHAME ON YOU WWE!SHAME ON YOU THQ!I WANT MY MONEY BACK!!!I hope Studio Gigante goes under for the trash they dumped on to an unsuspecting market."
1,Worst Game Ever!,This game is horrible. Do not waste your money on it. Get a PS2 and Smackdown if you want a good wrestling game.
2,MAJOR Disappointment,"i was really excited for this game to come out because of all the hype on it and plus it looked awesome. boy was i wrong. this game is terrible. not only does it have a limited career mode, but it fricken freezes on you ALL THE TIME! hello! i can understand an old nintendo game freezing but an xbox game? cmon! also with the freezing comes the slow moves and slow loading which makes it take forever to finish a match. basically this game seems so unfinished and if they extended the release date a few months to actually FINISH it, im sure it would be a lot better. thank god i only rented it because i would not waste 60 bucks on this crap!ps. by the way vince mcmahon, we xbox owners are still waiting for a good wrestling game!"
3,good in exibition only,good graphics good moves good title creating modes and good crete superstar but no stable edit and season mode sucks ! if u could use areal superstar in season it might be better oh there is a good code to peoples hew read dis reviw hold r and l and press
2,WRESTLEMANIA 21,SOME GAMING SITE WAS RIGHT WHEN IT SAID THAT THIS GAME IS LIKE THE EUGENE OF WWE.BUY AT YOUR OWN PERIL!!
5,the best wrestling game ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,this game is the best they bleed three differant ways and some of the people in the game are spike dudley tajri jbl big showkurt angle batista hhh ect.... and finally they changed lita'soutfit and finally batista is strong.this game is the best belive me.
1,I am not into games.,This was purchased for an individual that does not have a card and therefor cannot order items from the internet.
1,THQ toilet paper,Ever wipe your butt with a 50 dollar bill and flush it down the toilet? I just did.
1,"Dear People, Please Read This.","I would pleasely & kindly tell y'all that, THIS GAME IS A CURSE, GET RID OF IT AS POSSIBLE. THIS GAME STINKS, YOU CAN'T DO A DAMN THING IN THIS SO-CALLED MASTERPIECE, ITS DISASTERPIECE IN MY POINT OF VIEW.GRAB THE VIDEO GAME. (...)"
4,"Not bad, not as good as PS2 WWE games","Ok let's get to the bottom line, this game is a decent game to play. now let's see the pros and consPros: Awsome Graphics, Updated Roster, Better voice over acting, Blood goes on the rest of the body instead of the head, More added legends, reversing system is more realistic, Xbox Live, CAWCons: Grappling sucks, reversing a move is hard, really hard in superstar and legend difficulty, season mode is not good, it's hard to make a comeback, replay after matches load slow, winning a tag match is impossible to win, items to buy in WWE Shop costs too much moneyThis game is not bad, but it doesn't stand up to Smackdown vs. Raw. Next time THQ creates another WWE game for the Xbox, please make it a good game"
1,"Pretty, but that's it.","This game is like a beautiful girl with no personality. Nice to look at, but other than that very boring. The create-a-wrestler is very limited. The be-a-legend mode is so very nauseating. The gameplay is ""iffy"" at best. The only good thing is the voiceovers are good and it is very shiny."
1,If Only I Wished That I Didn't Listen To That Wrestlemania 21 Commercial!,"Man, could this game be any bad. I mean, you'd see much from the WWE games made much success as years go by. But I must say, this is there first to fail a game that was made. Because I had much respect what THQ & Vince where doing when they made this game a high quality (...). It wasn't bad at first after I bought the damn thing, then when I played it, I WAS DONE QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE!! Not because I beat the game, (...) Gameplays the most reason why I turned it in. Not only that, it always freezes the game when you have to wait to load or some crap. It also freezes when you're done in the first progress of season mode after you win your first match. Season is another thing, (...) gamemakers can't even make a good gameplaying on this piece of sh*t. (...) so I got my money back. Thats right, I'm tired of getting ripped off of people who try to screw me around.(...)"
2,This game is Kinda cool...,"Well, I was really excited for it to come out and all, but when it finally did, it wasn't SOO exciting.... Sure, the graphics, Voice Overs, and Matches are cool, but there are things that totally suck. Like the fact that you cannot make a female wrestler, you can only get 1 voice over for your custom wrestler (male) and the overall gameplay. Get it if you think the graphics are cool and if you only want to make a guy... It was a bit dissapointing, so I don't really recommend it..."
1,"NOT JUST THA WORST WWE GAME OF ALL TIME, THA WORST GAME OF ALL TIME!","SON'T BELIEVE THOSE KID REVIEWS! THERES NO STONE COLD IN THIS GAME! THIS GAME WAS MADE BY 1 YR. OLD! EVERYTIME U WIN A MATCH, IT FREEZES THE GAME! THIS GAME ISN'T EVEN WOTH 1 CENT!"
3,"Not the best game, but it's decent","I paid $6.00 for this game and for the most part, im happy with it. It does skip a whole lot, but thanks to the guy who left the last review, i can get the problem fixed. It almost moves like wwf attitude though. But, what is the saving grace for this gamne is the career mode and the create a player on here. It beats Raw 2 with a stick because raw 2 was a crock of crap. Im pretty happy with this game and like it or not, its the best wrestling game on the xbox so far."
1,Raw vs Smackdown is the way to go,"Once again THQ failed to bring a good wrestiling to the X-BOX. My advice is to stick with Raw vs Smackdown for the PS2, its a much better game. I will be taking my copy of Wrestlemana back to Game Stop for trade-in credit toward Star Wars E3."
1,The worst,"The collision detection alone is reason enough to give this game a 1 out of 5 star review.If only there were a 0 out of 5 option..This is hands down the very worst wrestling game ever, but is it the worst game [in general] of all time? I'm not sure. Undoubtedly the most disappointing game I've ever played though. To date. CAW (Create A WRESTLER) customization is the absolute worse.This game has absolutely no pros whatsoever. The best feature of the game is the graphics (by 2005 standards it was good). That is what built the hype around the game. I'm glad I didn't buy it, but actually borrowed from a friend way back when to try it out."
1,Total Waste Of Money!,"Let's just say, this game gave me a whole new appreciation for the Smackdown games! If you buy this game & want to create a female wrestler, don't bother! This crappy game will only allow you to create male wrestlers! Save yourself some time, money & absolute frustration & don't get this piece of crap!"
3,Wrestlemanina XXI: Become a Legend,"I ordered the regular XBOX game and they sent me the platnium game. Other than that it was shipped out fast, but I paid alot of money for the regular XBOX game and not the one listed above."
2,This Game Sucks,"I just bought this game eariler today. When I first started playing it I noticed that it kept freezing up all the time when it was loading. I was plaining to take it back and get a replacement, but after reading the other reviews of the same problem I'll forget it. This game was a BIG disapointment to me and I'm sure to all the other fans who went out and bought it. I hope and pray that they don't make ANOTHER wrestling game for the XBox. It seems everytime they do it SUCKS. Don't waist your money if you've not bought it yet. Buy it Used, I'm sure there will be alot of people selling or trading theres."
1,"WWF RAW=KRAP,WWE RAW 2=KRAP,WRESTLEMANIA 21=KRAP","I got an XBox-and have them all!RAW 1 suckedRAW 2 suckedWM 21 SUCKED!There is a wrestling game to be xcited about-folkz:TNA:iMAPACT! made by MidWay Entertainment.I like WWE and TNA both the same here,so don`t get me mixed in this WWE vs TNA thing butWWE WrestleMania 21 was a krap EVENT,Krap GAME and anything ELSE!So if u r lookin` for a good wrestling game-scru this,scru RAW1 and screw raw2.Just wait for the TNA game-or if u have a PS2-Get WWE SmackDown! vs RAW 2006,a GameCube DAY OF RECKONING 2,XBox the TNA game!i sold my dusty raw1 and raw2 along with wm 21 games on ebay for 15 dollars-glad i did-i recycled my money into better games 4 my XBox.(I do also own PS2 and GameCube)So if u are thinking about bying this-f`get it-blank it from your mind.This game along with its preds deserve to be taken off the gamestore shelves and the instructions ripped and all stamped on and burned then thrown in the sewers."
1,"Boy, As Much I Hate To Admit It, But I Agree What This Wacko Is Saying.","First off, I agree what that dude is saying, Vince & THQ screwed the gameplay in this game. Not enough bugs as well, thats why the game freezes. Season mode is crappy as hell. I hate to say this............but........................... Vince McMahon and THQ, you guys had let us down with this so called masterpiece. Well time to move on like lets say, Mario Party 7, Lets Go!"
1,Man This Game Is Full Of Hatred!,"Do y'allselves a favor, don't pay any attention to this lackluster & go on with smackdown! game hits for PS2 such as Smackdown! selftitled(PS1), Smackdown! 2 Know Your Role!(PS1), Smackdown Just Bring It!, Smackdown Shut Your Mouth!, Smackdown Here Comes The Pain!, & Smackdown vs Raw 2006. Smackdown vs Raw 1 sucks also, don't get that game. Wrestlemania 21 is for baby games only. `"
2,another game that could have been better,"its graphics suck loading take very long but you have new guys like euegene and other guys.New entrance music the only guy is edge his music cause it doesnt say""You think you know me"" well its educational 5 star for not buyimg something you guess you want."
5,Will Baby Duck learn to swim?,"Favorite characters: Baby Duck and GrandpaBaby Duck is girl who is on a swimming team. She loves swimming but is afraid that she won't perform good. She thinks she will be slow and swallow water. Her parents encourage her to jump in the pool and swim, but she doesn't want to. Then Baby Duck's team comes by and jumps into the pool, still Baby Duck doesn't jump in to swim. So Grandpa comes along and talks to Baby Duck trying to encourage her to swim with her team. You will have to read the rest of the story to find out if Baby Duck will swim with her team or not.This book is great for children or adults who are scared to do something, although they are really good at it and think they'll perform poor. Children will learn that you shouldn't be afraid of how well you will perform, just try to do your best and have fun, and greatness will come."
2,God,"The stories are interesting but unless you totally believe in God I'm not sure you will ""get"" this completely."
1,AA Big Book,Seller did not present item properly. Very disappointed in this purchase. Returned the item for credit.
1,Very dissatisfied,"I never received the book I orderedI plan to contact my credit card company to cancel the transactionIt was ordered on December 6th of last year and I was contacted about about 10 days ago from the ""loubellebookstore"" and was told they would send me another book. I have not heard from them since and have not received a book either.Very unhappyDwight Johnson"
5,good investment,"As a long standing active member of AA, my son had requested this book. I was pleased to be able to get it for him and he has turned many pages in it over and over again."
2,?? What Good is This? ??,"I purchased these thinking that I was buying the AA Big Book; there are distinct similarities upon initial (online) inspection. However, this isn't the entire Big Book; certain passages that I've found to be most relevant are absent. What good is this, then? Most dismaying is that their purchase price is the same as the standard AA Big Book. I've returned this purchase; it's far more practical for me to return them than it is to try to fit these 'round pegs' in the square holes that are best filled with a bona fide AA Big Book. Better luck next time. :)"
3,Confused 1st time buyer...,"I'm sure I am not the first one to order the 196 page Alcoholics Anonymous thinking I was getting the 500+ page Big Book. I had never bought an AA book... I wanted to purchase ""The Big Book"" and was sadly disappointed when I received this tiny book. I wish the description was made more clear. It's my own responsibility to have looked at the description more carefully. I kick myself for spending the money on something I didn't want though...that money could have gone towards ""The Big Book,"" which is much more expensive. I wish I could figure out a cost-free way of putting it on my Kindle."
5,This book saved my life!,"If it weren't for the help in this book, I would have another reality! This book helps live in a way that doesn't cause pain for myself or others."
5,AA Big Book the second best book ever after the bible,Story after story that distills what addiction is like for those who suffer and for those who care. The book shows that addicts are not alone and that there is hope.
4,"Alcoholics Anonymous: The Big Book, 4th Edition",I am a 5th step advisor and needed the book to guide counselees in the process. This book is the main authority on helping through the steps needed in recovery.
2,AA for FA,No the book was not a complète version therefore i will need to purschase another one.I wanted the complète edition not a minature book.
5,GREAT GIFT,THIS WAS A GIFT FOR A VERY SPECIAL PERSON WHO HAS SOME PROBLEMS THAT WE ARE HOPING THIS BOOK HELPS HIM WITH. IF HE WANTS HELP THEN HOPEFULLY HE WILL READ THIS BOOK. I GAVE IT A 5 STAR BECAUSE MY SON HAD TO USE THIS AND WOULD NOT PART WITH HIS BUT IT HELPED HIM TO WHERE HE HAS BEEN SOBER FOR OVER 7 YEARS NOW.
5,very happy,I was very impressed with the book and the speedy service. It came in the mail within a few days and I've been enjoying it.
2,Time For A Re-write,".No argument with the content or the history of the book.However, this book was written in 1939 and it shows. The language is stuffy and impentrable in many places. The author uses too many complex sentences and too many exotic words. Also, there are numerous culutral references that are totally lost on the reader in 2006.I know AA has seen a sharp decline in the sales of this book over the past 15 years. I can see why many in recovery today have little use for it (more than half of AA meetings no longer have the book around to sell). One wonders whether the message no longer resonates for the contemporary alcoholic, or if the stilted and cumbersome writing of the author leaves too many befuddled about what the message really is.I'd recommend the book if it was given a contemporary re-write. Until then, it's like trying to read the Bible in the original Sanskrit language.."
1,I've had at least 10 copies over the course of my life,...and I've NEVER been able to make it even 1/4 of a way through this snooze fest. Apparently it's helped some ppl. immensely - good for them. To me it just seemed like a veiled attempt to coerce me into becoming an X-tian which I will never be. But if I do decide to someday get a hankering for religion for a very odd unknown reason I'll get another bible (Much BETTER reading at least). This thing does a very good job as a sleep aid it's so utterly boring. Except for the drunken tales of woe (which are mildly interesting) it's so turgid I can't imagine how anyone can gain a modicum of interest in it.
2,Not a hand book for stopping drinking,"If you are looking for a religious answer to stopping drinking, then the Big Book is for you. Especially if you are not a believer in a mainline faith or have left one. It gives you a way of belief that will govern your drinking. If you are looking for a practical how-to book, then this is not the book. It is difficult to read and has no instructions other than just stop drinking. The Author channelled the book according to his God. If you enjoyed the Course in Miracles, you will enjoy this book."
1,waste of time,"I wish someone would have saved me from wasting my time by reading this book. Horribly written, sexist, outdated and full of lies.REad SMart Recovery or Hank Hayes new book You've Ben Lied to...."
5,help,"What people do not realize is that this book is for people with serious addictions. It is not to be diciphered as a religous book, that people are brain washed into believing. To an alcoholic fighting this book is the same as fighting the facts of our problems. This book is not about anything but help. I am an alcoholic, and after hating A.A and this book I realized that all the nonsense was not important. All the intellectual stuff is not important. If any book gets five stars its this one"
1,Not a Book it was a CD,"I purchased the AA Big Book for an inmate at Gus Harrison Correctional Facility, he did not receive the book, he received a CD. It has taken this long for me to get the CD back .... it was suppose to be a Book not a CD.Can I return it and get the book?Julia Caplett"
1,"misleading, amateur disc - NOT various artists","When I saw ""Various Artists"", and the names of the original performers of each song on the track list, that led me to believe that this contained the original versions of the songs Katharine McPhee performed on Idol - Think by Aretha Franklin, etc.WRONG! It is some guy who re-recorded these songs and stuck 'em on a disk and somehow convinced AMAZON to sell it!! Horrible. I can't send it back fast enough.They even spelled her name wrong on the disk: Katherine instead of Katharine. Some tribute!"
1,allergic reaction!,It seems as if it were plain soap i dont know but it caused me a terribly allergic reaction i have red dots all over my face and the seller did not do anything I WILL NEVER BUY THIS PRODUCT AGAIN
4,Works as described,Wish it had a flowery or fruity scent. Instead it just a part of a makeup routine without a refreshing olfactionary experience.
5,Dermalogia is the best,"Dermalogica is the best product for skin care, I should know I am an esthetician. Don't stop with just toner there are so many products that can go with this toner, like the skin smoothing cream (as a night cream) and the dynamic skin recovery spf 30 for your day cream. The special cleansing gel is good for all skin types. The one thing you need to know about Dermalogica is it's very concentrated and a little goes along way. The size of a dime is plenty."
4,EASY TO USE AND SMELLS GREAT!,This is a good toner. The spray makes it super fast and easy to use. I love the relaxing smell of the essential oils. One of my favorite products by dermalogica!
2,"Atmospheric, but nonsexy","I must admit, that in addition to my thirst for a surreal atmospheric vampire film I must have at least one gooood big boobs bite ala Gretas in ""twins of evil"". But in this movie there are no big boobs - very disappointing.The only arousing scene for me were the tigerwoman-dance.Again I feel misleaded by customer reviews, talking of uncensored nudity and so on. Vampires and very sexy bites stick together...Stil searching."
1,A MUST OWN I DONT THINK S0,i like most of you were depending on amazon reviws to by this film. somtimes i wonder if people really even no film. i have over 350 horror movies in my home libray and this one would be lucky to crack the top 300. nuff said.
1,A real horrorshow,"An absolute farce of a movie. Strained often wooden acting along with some of the most ghastly make-up and cheesy special effects turn this so-called vampire frightfilm into a true horrorshow. Some films are so bad that they are good ie: The hills have eyes,Terminator 1, etc....... This one is neither. Must to avoid."
5,"Finally, an Excellent Edition of an Excellent Movie","Kudos to the folks behind this DVD/Blu Ray combo! At long last, we Hammer Horror fans have a truly impressive copy of VAMPIRE CIRCUS, one of the most interesting and entertaining vampire movies ever made. Long unavailable on legitimate DVD or VHS in this country, VAMPIRE CIRCUS is one of the most requested Hammer titles--and this edition does not disappoint. The transfer is excellent and UNCUT (although the sex scenes, which were quite daring 40 years ago, will most likely inspire amused giggiles today), and the extras are wonderful. Extras include mini-docs on the making of the film and a piece on the guy who put out the Hammer monster mag/comic book back in the 70s. Check this one out ASAP!"
4,vampire circus,"good movie over all, But the pepole flying through the air was a bit lame. But still a good movie. [p]."
5,Hammer at its BEST,Beautifully Filmed!!! Wonderful vampire characters. The best vampire film to date
2,"A good set of ideas, but poorly executed","I can see where the author is coming from, and I think I see what he wants to say. The problem? He rambles. A lot. Stories of his experiences as the CEO of Herman Miller and his vacations seem to crop up every few paragraphs, and more than a few seem only tenuously connected to the subject matter. I also spotted several plugs for books that he enjoyed without even an explanation as to why he enjoyed them or how they relate to what he's talking about. With all the name-dropping he did, I imagine it was a favor for a friend. It just didn't feel quite right to me."
4,Inspiring,"This book is not only inspiring to me, but has been a great discussion resource for our entire management team. We are a fast moving, innovative high performance organization, with lots of personal and organization development under our belts. And yet, this simple little book is concrete enough to point new directions for growth and challenge us to be even better. Thanks Max!"
1,Do not spend money on this book,"He doesn't say anything new, his Polyanna tone gets annoying and also there were parts where I found undertones of racism. There is no particular structure from chapter to chapter and it's more of his stream of consciousness. Although he talks a great deal about the virtues of non-profits and those who serve such organizations, he is essentially a capitalist with a heart. If you need to read this, check it out from the library for free."
5,a fresh recording,"I bought this album basically as a bargain of Kovacevich's Chopin performance. It made me so curious since he once said, he's got a little bit afraid of playing so, like other music of the Romanticism. While it terms out to be wired that he said so -- Kovacevich's got some extraordinary records here. Barcarolle, one of the most beautiful pieces of Chopin, terms out to be almost an impressionistic dream here, so do the two Nocturnes. What you'd always expect from Kovacevich, accuracy, elegance and transparency are still here, and there's the mellifluence. His performance's always magic... kind of ability that makes one indulged. Of course, we always get to know Chopin from Rubinstein, Arrau, Horowitz, ... those great and immortal recordings. While for some dreams, listen to Kovacevich."
4,Kovacevich shines,"This set is bargain priced and worth every penny just to get the Kovacevich pieces. He has critically acclaimed recordings of Beethoven, Schubert, and Brahms, but it turns out he is a born Chopin player as well. Giants such as Richter, Rubinstein, Lipatti, Argerich, Perahia, Pollini and many others have recorded the Barcarolle (arguably Chopin's single greatest work). The Kovacevich interpretation may be the best of all"
2,Sloppy writing,"I didn't know anything about the author or his previous writings before I picked up this book, so I evaluated it on a more objective basis, I guess. Perhaps if I had been a fan of his poetry or hadn't read so many other (better) memoirs, I would have liked this more. I found his writing to be extremely sloppy, and--yes, although it is a memoir, I acknowledge--he seems like an egomaniac. Yes, it's great that you've had such a checkered life and met so many eccentric characters, but it's nothing we haven't seen before. Many of these essays and recounted episodes are clearly exaggerated and not particularly entertaining, except maybe to the author himself."
1,Blow Daddy Blow,"August Kleinzahler's written endorsements of his own street credibility have always cracked me up--dropping Derek Raymond's name in a 2004 diary piece for the London Review of Books actually had me wiping tears from my eyes--so I'm glad to report it's more of the same in this latest addition to his oeuvre. That's right, Augie has an oeuvre--sure why wouldn't he and him a poet? A jazz critic too apparently. Oh my yes, a real gone hepcat and no mistake."
4,Fictionalized account of author's youth in Los Angeles,"I'm a big fan of Fante's, and I would only like to clear up one point that the other reviewers have given conflicting information on. Although about Fante's alter ego in his youth, this book WAS dictated to Fante's wife, Joyce, when he was ill and blind with diabetes. It is, as far as I know, the last thing he wrote before he died."
2,There's better Fante,"Written when Fante was a young man, this will probably only be interesting to the Fante compleatist."
1,"Misogynist, Racist, and Dated","Fante seems quaint and offensive by today's standards. Another wholly disappointing offering from a mediocre writer, like a second-rate Steinbeck best left to obscurity."
2,"Mostly tedious, with interesting parts","I found the writing interesting, and the subject fascinating, but I found myself frustrated by the author's difficulty in talking directly about the status of Muslim women with her interview subjects. The author spent many pages writing about the menus and dress of the many middle and upper-middle class women she interviewed. It seemed as though her interview subjects resisted her efforts to discuss the status of women in their countries, so we too as readers had to wade through much distracting material and misunderstandings about feminism and gender. Great travel stories, but not a great source of information about Muslim women."
1,Rambling and pointless,"This is a rambling account of the author's travels in Islamic countries as she tries to understand the existence and nature of their feminism. But she recounts a hit and miss series of encounters, a day here and there in each place, and never summarizes what she understands each country's feminism to be, or to compare them. It is a book with potential -- there is value in recounting her personal experience -- but it is too often at the level of what people wore and ate, and disconnected comments about women and feminism. The author doesn't take the next step toward making sense of it."
1,Disappointing,"After using his soup book for years and enjoying his salad book for the last year, I thought I couldn't go wrong by buying ""From a Monastery Kitchen. . . "" I could. And did. I've tried two recipes, the Lentil/Lemon Rind Soup and the Quick Apple Cake and both were dismal. I tossed the book."
3,Not for those who don't do dairy,"Nearly all of the recipes in this book include milk in some form or another. As a person who cannot consume milk, this book is of little utility."
4,A Delightful Read,"And I thought my family was embarrassing! Author Brenda Scott Royce has a skill for building layer upon layer of believable hilarity.Protagonist Holly Heckerling has a knack for picking up stray pets and wayward friends. With a degree in ""monkey-ology"" (don't make me look up the official name), Holly isn't quite living up to her education. She performs odd jobs such as hair cutting and typing, while trying to breakthrough as a stand-up comic.If only Holly's friends and family would give her a bit of breathing room, she might have time to find herself, and a love that lasts longer than her ""record"" three months.Throughout the reading, I found myself literally laughing out loud. Ultimately, you'll fall in love with Monkey Love."
3,Monkey Love,The book dragged - I expected more laugh out loud parts. Although there were some humorous situations. it was a little disappointing.
4,Must Read,"This book is really funny! I bought it a while ago, and am finally getting around to reading it. I had just finished reading Only in London, and thought it was funny how both books have the same type of monkey in them. As far as this book goes, what can go wrong will, and it is interesting to see it all unfold. I especially liked Holly's aunt who would put people on ice, and her cousin Gerry and his sock collection. This book is visual and I would love to see it on the big screen. Anyway, I'm looking forward to see how it will all end."
3,Over-the-top,"I'm all for comedy and laugh-out-loud humor, but this book was a little too wacky for me. The overly-zany escapades and beyond-belief characters made this a difficult read. However, the ending of the story was totally satisfying ... not because I was done reading the book, but because it felt like some reality finally set in."
1,The dumbest book I've ever read.,"Out of curiosity, I picked up this hardcover book at a St. Vincent DePaul store for 50 cents. After reading all 297 agonizing pages of it, I think it was overpriced!"
1,recent dispatches from wignutistan,"""Brownie, you're doing a heck of a job"" that is about as close to a conspiracy as FEMA comes to folks. dont believe a scant second of the rest of this bat guano insane frothing.that scary ""detention camp"" in Wyoming? they are indeed forced-labor colonies, camps, and prisons-in North Korea.Beech Grove, allegedly the the Dachau and Auschwitz of America, is in the real world of chemically balanced people the primary maintenance facility for Amtrak's long-distance trains, overhauling and repairing approximately 700 passenger cars a yearthis FEMA stuff is just conspiracy theory bunk. you people got suckered out of your hard earned money that you could have just given to goldline."
2,I was expecting more,I once read an excellent book on giving talks to youth and it was very useful and entertaining so I thought I would pick up a few of his movies. He covers a lot of ground in this talk and it is great material but it is all over the place. He is funny and there are some funny parts in this but lots of dull places as well.
5,Evolution Tour,Estefan is at her best in this performance. I love the excellent sound quality and the great video footage. She is one hot singer and the Miami Sound Machine is fantastic. If you like Gloria Estefan even a little bit you'll love this DVD.
5,Darn Buses,I've been a bus driver over 30 years. It's sad a bus accident put the brakes on one of the hottest singers ever. Well whenever I'm in south Florida you hear the Miami Sound Machine featuring the great Gloria Estefan. Nothing like performing in front of the home folks. So this concert was and is especialmente.
5,BestVerdian soprano ever!,"It is impossible for a passionate Verdi listener not to match the music of Aida,Leonora(1and2),Amelia with the incomparable voice of Leontyne Price.When trying to explain the meaning of the verdian""canto spiegato""it is sufficient to play one of the tracks of this marvellous CD!But also in her Puccini (Tosca) and Mozart(Donna Anna) roles miss Price brings in a freshness, an authority ,which makes also this listening sessions a thrilling experience ."
3,"Not close to as good as the others, but listenable","This CD is one that is really different from other Kottonmouth Kings Discs. It does not sound as hard or as fast like the Kings that everyone is used to. It is cool that they switched it up though but when it starts sounding like Jazz then you know that this is not a cd to turn up, but more of one to turn down a little when your chillin. If the CD was longer it would have had a better chance to get some better songs out of it but it is only 11 tracks none of them (I THINK)are not that good. Just when you buy this CD do not go out there looking for the same raw sound you get from KMK but a little toned down. It's still not a BAD cd though. But if you dont have any kottonmouth king cds try the others first."
3,"Not Bad, But Not Great.","I gave it a try because it was their second album and I prefer their older stuff. ""Royal Highness"" is their best in my opinion. It had some good beats and production. It seemed to me though, that they were just trying to re-make ""Royal Highness"", ""1605 Life"" is just basically a remix of ""Suburban Life"" off of ""Royal Highness"". So I feel like it lacked creativity. It's not bad at all, but not great either."
5,shouts going out,"Awesome cd...Dude... if your gonna come on here talkin like you know everything, YOU need to get your facts straight. There obviously was beef with saint and kmk... ever heard the song ""ego trippin"" by saint? and it took how many years for him to come back to sub noize???? 4 years to sign back with them, and 5 to release a cd with them. You say he has a punk band, but kmk has much more punk influence in it than the stuff saint has released since he left.... In your own D-Loc jocking words... UR Done."
4,Smoke a BOWL!,"This cd has some pretty tight rhymes, but I do think that their newer stuff is better. So of the beats could be better, I guess. And just so everybody knows this is KmK's second full length album. Stoner reeking Havoc was their independantly released EP then Royal Highness was their first full length album, then this cd, which was re-issused recently by the band. Then came High Society, Hidden Stash II, Rollin Stoned, and most recently Fire It Up. I don't think P-town ballers released anything, but i'm not sure. Also Saint left the group because of creative differences, but is now pursuing a solo rap career on Suburban Noize Records."
1,Poor customer service.,"I never received the item. Called the company and got no help, was told they shipped it and that was that."
2,too preachy and over the top,"I was initially excited by this video, but I discovered that it really did not teach the story of Easter very well, and it was a little too over the top. The singing was pretty good, but the preaching was way too much than I like for children."
5,One of Essra's best!,"This is a great album, but it's not rare or out of print. In fact, it's available at Essra's web site for nearly a quarter of the price that this goniff is charging!Go to: EssraMohawk.com for the real deal!"
4,Love That Moves Sun and Planets,"The bereaved father who's lost his seven year old daughter, upon visiting her grave twelve years later, finds his daughter's body perfectly preserved - just as he had left it. His fellow townspeople call the event a miracle but the town bishop wants the child reburied. The father must fight his way through political and religious obstacles to have his daughter declared a first Colombian Saint.Undying father's love and devotion for his innocent child that perform miracles in Roma - that's what this screen adaptation of Gabriel Garcia Marquez's short story ""La Santa"" is about. Moving and heartwarming, darkly comical and satirical, the movie is simple and profound in the same time.7.5/10"
1,Mad / upset,"I ordered this movie and not even a day , they cancelled my order without a reason. I wish Amazon would take stuff like this off ! If the seller can not produce the goods avertised they need to REMOVE IT !!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Forewarned,I should not rate this DVD as I have not purchased it. There seems to be some difficulty in purchasing and the price is prohibitive. I think I'd better hang on to my VHS copy that I taped from the original airing on TV. I just purchased and received Lace I. I have not had a chance to view it. I hope it is as the reviews say it is.
3,World War II England,"Collin's character is Agatha Christie who, while helping the war effort by working by day in a hospital, links up with renowned pathologist Sir Bernard Spilsbury in his investigation into a series of Ripper-style murders committed under the cover of London's numerous blackouts. London's women, already strained and anxious because of the wartime inconveniences, are terrified. With every blackout, a murderer might be lurking in the darkened alleys or shelters to claim another victim.Collins is careful to let us know where the lines between his fiction and Christie's factual life intersect, and points out that many of the characters in this novel were, in fact, real people. Information about wartime hazards and the ways Londoners adjusted to them is artfully described, giving readers a sense of life in England's ""homefront"" during these devastating years."
2,bookgram,"While I've read all of Dame Agatha's books and enjoyed them, I'm not sure she really made a good detective. I found it improbable that she would have access to the information and people that she did....in spite of her celebrity status. Not a bad story tho and a quick read."
3,The London Blitz,It is very hard to get into.....Not pleased with this purchase at all. I will be careful of ordering his books again.
2,Agatha Christie ruleZ...,"The book is based on real murders done by a new Jack the Ripper during WWII, in London. Agatha Christie appears in a book, helping police inspector and pathologist solve the crimes. The author did thorough research and mentioned a lot of Agatha's novels (no spoilers included!). There are also many details about her life.The book is an interesting read for Agatha Christie fans, and it plots a nice picture of London in the days of the war, but if you expect a whodunit novel, you will be disappointed. I recognized the killer the moment he was introduced, the police suspected him from the beginning and, finally, he was the guilty one. No twist in the plot, and even the murderer's motive is not revealed (mass murderers don't have a motive?)If you compare The London Blitz Murders with A.B.C. Murders (Agatha's novel about the mass murderer), you can see why Ms. Christie was one and only..."
5,superb interpretation and recording,"Both volumes in this set offer vivid, gripping performances, beautifully balanced and perfectly nuanced. You really feel as if you are alone in the room with the performers. You also feel as if you are alone in the room with the soul of Beethoven. Introspective aloneness is what Beethoven's sonatas for violin and piano are about. The performers bring out this feeling amazingly; they really know the music, and Beethoven's lonely soul."
2,its ok for background music,"space or dream of life is ok, but i belive it would have been better if the recording levels would have been turn up a little bit higher. i found myself having to turn the volume up a little higher than expected, for it to sound better. at first i gave this dts cd a bad review, it seems to have a low dynamic range, and lack of surrounds, due to the low recording level. i wrote the bad review, after someone else had the same opinion that i had. so other than that i will say that this cd is ok"
4,Good CD,"The CD is a pretty good CD. I listen to it on PS2, with my Yamhaa TSS-1 White speakers. The artist did a good job of compsoing the song, and blending in the DTS capablity."
2,"not what i was expecting may 30, 2003","the person who reviewed this cd audio, may 5, 2003 was right. this cd was not what i thought. the dts format does nothing to improve the surround effects. and the music is not all that great. take my advice, buy studio voodoo-club voodoo instead."
2,Not What I Thought,"I bought this CD thinking it would be some pretty cool music, judging buy the cover and the title. Wrong. It has boring and very repetative beats that go on for about 17 minutes. It isn't very interesting to listen to. Don't judge a CD by its cover.."
2,Just too automatic,"The flashgun is well engineered and looks rugged. It works well on the camera as an automatic flash, but it gives little scope for creative photography. When used with a FZ30 camera, it sets the aperture at f4.0 and the shutter speed at 1/30 sec, and this cannot be varied. The built in flash allows the flash exposure to be varied by +/- two stops, but the addition of the DMW-FL28 takes away this adjustment. The only adjustments are three stages of flash strength. There is also a auto-macro setting, a manual setting that uses the same three stages of adjustment and a manual setting, again using the same three stages. There is a slave setting, which flashed when I used the weakest setting for the built-in flash, but I did not get any flash in the picture - perhaps a timing problem. Had I known this, I would have tried an independent flash as an alternative."
1,Poor instructions,I am a novice when it comes to digital cameras and I found the manual that comes with the camera(Panasonic FZ-50) for the flash attachment and the manual for the flash itself to be very hard to understand. I had better results with the built in flash so I returned the flash attachment. I even called Panasonic's help[ desk and they just read from the manual which did not help me. The flash attachment may be very good for someone that knows how to set it.
3,"Finally, a place to get an 18"" tire!","I needed an 18"" tire for a kids bike...not a 16"" tire, not a 20"" tire. Nobody seemed to carry them. Found one here and it's worked great. Can't say how happy my son was to have his bike back again!"
5,Great CD,"This was a great buy! My son is in the play and this was just what he needed to learn the lyrics. Since it has both the songs with vocals and without, it was a big help!"
3,Helpful,"It was helpful for me. I didn't really like it though because it wasn't the same as the broadway version, but i only needed it once, so i guess it was perfect for me."
1,I should have downloaded a listen for this before I purchased it.,"Actually, I'm returning the CD for a refund. Plus, I only ordered one and was sent two. I'm sending them both back for refund. The quality of the CD sounded too tinty on certain songs and some songs were too high in key signature above the 1995 Broadway Version. Some songs were okay, but I cannot use the entire CD and mix it with something else so I'm sending it back."
3,Rock Hudson and Angie Dickinson ruined a good book,"The movie was awful, but the book was hilarious....The coach works his way thru the cheerleaders one at a time, first nailing them, then killing them when they want him to leave his wife and marry them. The story is told thru the eyes of a student, and the phrase he uses to describe his discovery of a dead cheerleader in a bathroom stall, "" there she was, that tight, white, cheerleader p____y"" has stayed with me since I first read the book, nearly 40 years ago. Wish I could find a copy for less than $25. Must be a rare book now."
3,all right,"came on time but its a week laser not worth 5 dollers, cheep laser pionters are the same as this."
4,Solid Basic of Starting an Information Brokering Business,"In contrast to Mary Ellen's book, this book is actually for self-starters who are thinking about creating their own small business and covers such excellent basics as the market for information, what an information broker does, the pros and cons of the information business, and then the tools, followed by chapters on marketing, pricing, and project management. Although seven years old now, I still regard this as a good starting point for those who would understand the information brokering business (a small niche within the larger open source intelligence business)."
4,"My information ""Bible!""","A friend recently said I have ""an almost pathological passion"" for research. Yip, he's right! And this book, along with Reva Basch's ""Researching Online For Dummies"" has been of invaluable help. I read some parts of both nearly everyday. I've read in other reviews that The Information Broker's Handbook was skimpy on where to find info online. Maybe, but that wasn't the whole point of the book. And, at nearly 580 pages, it is more than sufficient in detail and is a clear, informative guide. Most people probably wouldn't pick a technical manual to read for recreational reading, but it is so interestingly written that it really is hard to put down, and you learn so much even from casual reading a bit at a time. I love this book, and couldn't do without it. It is perfect for information nuts, especially since the Internet is a knowledge junkie's paradise!"
4,Good overview of the business.,I felt it was a good background on the industry. I expected more information with examples. Very detailed on where to find information elsewhere on the business and for the business.
3,Reference book,This book I can't really comment on because I returned it. It wasn't what I was looking for exactly.
4,The Inner Voice is an aria sung with elegance by diva Renee Fleming,"Renee Fleming is the star of the world of opera who grew up in suburban surroundings in upstate New York. Miss Fleming's book recounts the steps she took to ascend the ladder of fame andfortune as a star of the Met and European opera houses.Fleming is the divorced mother of two girls who has dedicatedher life to the difficult, demanding and disciplined life of anopera singer. She is fluent in several languages, oftens suffersstage fright and goes into great detail on how an opera singerproduces glorious sound.This book would be instructive to aspiring classical singers and fans of the operatic world. The book focuses on Fleming's career and is short of backstage gossip.Along with the recent book by Joseph Volpe on his years at the Met this book could serve as a good introduction to a modern operatic career."
4,a real account,"This is an easy read. I love that she is so down to earth, not trying to be an icon or legend."
5,The Inner Voice: The Making of a Singer,"Renee Fleming is beautiful, a superb singer and an intriguing writer! Her autobiography attracted me immediately as I began reading and continued as I proceeded. (I chose it initially because I wanted to inform myself, but also pass the book along to a talented granddaughter who dreams of being onstage one day...""The Making of a Singer"" was a large drawing card for me)Renee has an innate sense of humor which I find delightful. I stronglyrecommend her book!"
1,"Not compatible with ""most"" cameras","This item was mistakenly shipped to me by Amazon instead of a different battery charger. I thought I might keep it, as the package claims that it is compatible with most Canon digital cameras, plus many other brands. of the 1 Nikon and 3 Canon cameras in use at my office and the one Canon I own personally, it isn't compatible with any of them. Also, there are no instructions included to explain the various components. Check the company's website for the device you own before ordering this item."
1,HORRIBLE BOOK,"This book is horrific. The student is left clueless. In no way is this for a beginner in probability. its probably for someone who has lots of experience and solid background in probability. Hard to believe that this 1996 book is being used today in 2006 in some schools, when there are several good books published in probability. Either the school wants to fail you, or they just want to make it incredibly tough for the student by deciding to use this. Last semester my school was using the ross sheldon probability, which is much better. This book is of no use other than to be treated as a toilet paper."
2,Cheap toy - big disappointment,"This bucket looks like it would provide plenty of opportunity for creative play, but it did not. The ""cans of play-doh"" were not standard size, but rather, the tiny 2 ounce ones that are pretty useless. The food molds are too small and the dough got stuck. Because of that, my kids left the molds filled with play-doh on the table and went off to play in their ""kitchen"" where they played with wooden food toys.You are better off with simple cans of playdoh and a bunch of cookie cutters. This toy was really junky.The only reason I gave this a 2 for durability is because the pieces are made of plastic and wont break."
2,DO NOT BUY - It's a live recording.,It's only 3 bucks but it's a waste if you really want to listen to something of any quality. I first made the mistake of buying the piano only concert (bad move - you need the symphony and choral). THen I made the mistake of buying this POS!! You can hear people coughing and moving and the recording is all scratchy! Rediculous! I have no idea why the other 2 people gave this thing 5 stars. The only reason I'm not giving it one star is because it is one of the most beautiful pieces of all time - just don't buy this recording.
5,Pompeii and Herculaneum,"I've always been fascinated with these two cities, the modern era is very lucky to have these two cities, Pompeii and herculaneum, encapsulated into 'time capsules' so that we can now, very carefully, read entire libraries of preserved papyrus scrolls of lost histories and novels and even personal correspondence that helps us to have more of an understanding of the mighty Roman Empire, to see the plaster casts of the last minutes of life for these people, slaves and masters alike."
4,"Some flaws, but does what it is supposed to do","Does what it is supposed to do: Allows you to listen to mp3's and streaming internet radio on your stereo. The interface is not perfect, mostly because it is a pain to page through every single artist or album (in alphabetic order) to get to the one you want.On the other hand: it is wireless, and it uses an older wireless system, not the newer 802.11b or g. Believe it or not, this is an advantage. 802.11b is notoriously undependable, especially in a home environment, because it shares the same spectrum as cordless phones.Unfortunately, it does not appear that there will be any further development on this product. The software has been at version 1.2 since I bought it months ago. But while the software could be slicker, it is fully functional, and does what it is supposed to do.I recommend this product."
1,SLIMP3 vs Simplefi,"I've tried the Simplefi and it was a pain to use. Compared to my SLIMP3, the Simplefi is hard to setup, hard to use and unreliable. And it costs fifty dollars more!The SLIMP3 is super easy to set up and use, works with Windows, Mac and a variety of Unix platforms. The software is open source and well supported by the company and the user community. Check it out!"
1,Cheap videotape spoils wonderful stories,"My four-year-old son loves Little Bear and his friends, and is not too demanding in regard to technology, but even he found this lousy EP/SLP videotape unwatchable, much to his disappointment. I find it unconscionable that the producers of this video would use such poor quality tape and still charge such a hefty price."
4,Great Value for money,"I bought the unit a few days ago and Works great.DVD player plays all formats as mentioned. I have some CD-R/VCD/CD-RW from different countries and it could play it all.VCR is pretty good too, however some noise through the coaxial.Memory reader is a cool feature, reads Sony Memory Stick well. Slideshow is a good feature.Universal Remote is nice, operates TV/VCR/DVD as well.Compared to V4600 reviews, I think Samsung has done a good job with this model. It is compact and slick compared to some other brands.Issue: ""Memory Stick Pro"" could not read Sandisk 256mb. Also, photoviewer in general is very slow.This is a great value for money !"
1,Just a poorly-designed unit,"So, as soon as I get it home, I only get sound from the right channel when using a DVD, but both when playing a VHS. So that means there's an internal fault somewhere with the DVD player. Also, I've never seen a DVD player where pressing Menu while a DVD is playing, brings you to the system menu, NOT the DVD's menu. That is ridiculous. My unit is definitely going back, and will be replaced with a Sony or something else NON-Samsung."
1,Very dissapointed. Horrible remote.,"Have had this for several years. The player actually works okay for both VCR and DVD use.However, the remote control is so poorly designed, I rarely use the unit. The buttons are small, and as another reviewer commented, pressing menu takes you back to the main setup, and you have to start over. It's too bad, because as I said, I have had no technical issues with the DVD play, VCR play, or memory card. You will regret buying this unit. I use component hookup for my DVD, and have the sound connected to a Sony receiver control center. No technical issues at all. Still only a one. What a horrible remote."
2,Not all it's cracked up to be,"I purchased this because it appeared to be compatible with all formats of dvds including DVD+R-DL. It was. The problem was that it was difficult to control. The fast-forward and next-chapter were the same button and you had to remember whether you wwere to punch it once or hold it down. After a few months, I gave it to the Salvaton Army and bought another Sony."
1,Not Taylor!!,"Its awful. Its not Taylor, it shouldnt even have his name associated with this product."
1,"Boy, oh boy....","The things that record companies will put out to turn a quick buck.... First of all, Taylor Hicks is such a new ""artist"" (I use that term loosely) that his work hardly qualifies for a ""Tribute to"" album at this very infant stage of his career. He has not even had a hit song yet. He won American Idol. Chris Daughtry has already left him in the dust as far as popularity and album sales go. Let's see if Taylor Hicks is even still relevant in another 2 years or so before we jump the gun and put out a laughable ""Tribute"" album. Or, maybe I am mistaken and this is all just a big joke?"
5,perfection,"this an absolutely brilliant guitar tab book. With all the songs from ""we are not alone"" transposed to the exact notes played on the studio album!It has notes on the tablature telling you how to play the songs, eg. use thumb on 6th string. this is quite common on tab books, so nothing to get too excited about, but atleast its there."
5,the .NET developer's first line of defense,"Excerpt from C# Online.NET Review (wiki.CSharp-Online.NET):""I have read many Sgt. Joe Friday accounts of Windows security--""Just the facts, Ma'am""--; but, Windows security remained an occult subject to me. However, this book enables me to program security functions and to understand what I am doing. The book explains the user-based security of Windows operating systems based on Windows NT including Windows 2000, Windows XP Professsional, and Windows Server 2003."""
4,Terse cookbook style overview of .NET Security,"I wasn't thrilled with the organization of this book. The chapters, which are essentially recipe answers to security questions are sometimes very short (2-3 pages). The text is very focused and terse. The coverage of the book is excellent though. It's wide ranging, and as long as you can keep up, relatively in-depth. The coverage of privileges and sessions is very good. Worth a look for security professionals."
2,"Great musicians, so-so music","When I saw the list of artists on this album my jaw dropped. I mean these are some of the premiere musicians of our era. Well, I was severely disappointed by the lack of effort put into this album. Each song is a 4 minute long solo - each with their own personal lack of depth. Listening to this album is like listening to the bath tub filling up."
1,How bad could it be?,"Real bad!! What kind of soundtrack is this. You can tell the artist weren't putting there all into these tracks. This CD is a waste. I could go on and on but I don't want to even type what I feel bout this. The only songs I liked were.....Put Me On(Mario), Dance With You(Solange feat. B2K), and Can I Holla(Young Steff feat. Bow Wow). I'll holla."
4,"If you liked the movie, you'll enjoy the soundtrack.","The music on this soundtrack appeals to a broad range of listeners; in our household the range is 4 to 40-something. If you liked the movie, I think the soundtrack will appeal to you too.As a previous reviewer, WARRIOR 77, pointed out though, it is rather disappointing that the tune Tracy and Calvin were doing in the car in the scene ""A Trip With Tracy"" was left off the CD. It may be entitled ""Party Up (Up In Here),"" which I noticed on DMX's ""And Then There Was X"" CD."
4,Folding Replacement Passenger Side Mirror,Mirror was perfect replacement fit and finish. Would liked to have knowen there was a lower trim piece that finish off the mirror and what hardware was needed.
1,Not for Children!,"Don't be fooled by the title or the charming cover illustration. This book is not about a tea party. It is a cookbook - for a teenager or adult. Several of the recipes have eight, nine, or ten ingredients and include roasting a whole chicken!"
2,not really!!,This product is not really any better than the other products on the market. NO topical medication is going to clear up a systemic problem.
5,Masterpiece: Inspector Lewis Season 3,We received the DVD Masterpiece: Inspector Lewis Season 3. This DVD is great addition to our library Masterpiece Mystery collection. Thank you so much.
5,Inspector Lewis Series - A pleasant surprise.,Just recently got hooked on the Inspector Lewis Series. There are very well written and appear to be realistic. The peeks at the town of Oxford are also rewarding.The Instant Video really works great for me as travel a lot.
5,Inspector Lewis is the bomb!,This series filled a hole in my TV life that was left by the cancellation of the Inspector Lynley series. I enjoy the interaction between Lewis and Hathaway and find the stories believable overall. The setting in Oxford is fun and makes me yearn to return to England. Well-acted and directed.
5,Love This Series,I like this series very much. I am a big fan of British Mys' and this is a very good one.
2,Jumped the Shark,"I am a big fan of the series shown on masterpiece theater on PBS. This is how I was first exposed to Inspector Lewis. I enjoyed the first few series and the episode that is shown in this volume, the first one, about the aging rock stars. However the succeeding episodes were absolutely terrible. They lacked depth, creativity or even coherence. It seemed like I was watching a bad soap opera rather than an episode of an acclaimed mystery series. Anyway, I didn't like it, and you need to be really into the little bits of culture mentioned here and there to even stand it."
5,British Mysteries,"I love British Mysteries, and these are no exception. The pairing of Lewis and Hathaway is inspired casting. Sometimes it's hardto understand Hathaway but over all, the stories are gripping and delightful. Hope they keep coming..."
5,Keeps getting better,"I so enjoy DCI Lewis and his sidekick DC Hathaway. They make a great team in snooty little Oxford, England."
5,very enjoyable,"I especially love the music pieces in Dark Matter. Song without End played with the cello and piano, quite lovely."
4,Nice flavor additions to my kitchen,"You can cook with these delicious, lightly flavored oils, or use them after cooking to ""season to taste"". Great as bases for salad dressings, including pasta salads."
1,Sounds are not very good,"I bought this as requested by my grandfather, for him to give to my father, an engineer. My pap has the bird sounds clock, and enjoys it very much. He thought my father would enjoy this as well. My dad has it hanging in the living room, and probably always will, because his dad gave it to him. The sounds for each train are very weird. The first time I heard it I thought the TV was picking up static. Some of the hours have a conductor talking along with the train sounds. You can't understand what he is saying, it's all garbled. A few of the train sounds actually sound like train whistles, but for the most part I am not impressed. Unless you are a real train buff who collects anything with a train on it, I would save your money, and steer away from this clock."
2,Somewhat disappointing,"Great train images on this wall clock -- large size, etc. but the sound quality is disappointing. It is sound-activated but even if you shine a light right into the sensor, the sound is pretty weak on some of the recordings. Doesn't work for younger people -- I wanted to give this as a gift to my train-loving nephew but it was a drag having to ""explain"" why it was hard to hear some of the train recordings."
2,"One star for content, plus one for the title.","This sounds like a bunch of thirteen year olds trying to cover early Man or Astroman, and failing miserably. The ain't-I-clever song titles and amateurish playing don't help matters in the slightest.Notable really only for some of the absolute worst drumming ever heard on record."
5,Scorching!,"It includes two numbers at the beginning from a concert in December 1967, and one number from Monterey is only heard as Denny Dent paints the introductory painting. But the rest of the performance is all here in full color - and this was the first time the American audience was really turned on to the Jimi Hendrix Experience. It's a great show - yes, he burns the guitar at the end, but if that's all you're interested in you can see that in the Pennebaker film. This video is best because it is a complete record of him first blowing the audiences minds - and THEN when it can go NO FURTHER, demolishing his equipment. What more can you ask for? A classic."
4,An Underrated Fine Recording of Brahms' String Concerti,"This is one of the lesser treasures in Philips' catalogue, which deserves to be reissued in a remastered format as one of this label's great recordings. The highlight is the splendid performance of Brahms' Double Concerto with cellist Janos Starker and violinist Henryk Szeryng both excellent soloists. I have rarely heard such a fine performance of this concerto, with neither soloist outshining the other; both are mutually compatible. Under Bernard Haitink's direction, the Concertgebouw Orchestra yields a warm, vibrant performance. Szeryng's performance of the Violin Concerto is fine, though he lacks the technical prowess of a Mutter or Vengerov, especially in some of the most technically demanding passages in the first movement. Still this is an excellent analogue recording of Brahms' string concerti and one worth owning."
3,Mozart for Meditation,It is not as meditative as I would have liked. Doesn't do the job I wanted it to do.
5,Mozart at his most gentle,"This album delivers what it promises. Music for meditation. That may sound obvious but that is the albums beauty! I love classical music but usually have no idea who or what I am listening to. Many classical albums feature work from either a single composer and give a variety of their works or they celebrate many different composers and their varying works. It is the variety that can be the problem!! For people like myself, who have limited knowledge of classical music, how do we know what to buy? Often it is a particular style of music we are looking for to capture a particular mood. This album can be bought with the reassurance that what you get will play softly in the background from beginning to end and don't be surprised to find that you have drifted off!!! Wonderful, beautiful, music for meditation ...by some guy called Mozart!!!!"
2,Nice...Not Great,"I was expecting this to be true to its title""Meditation"".Though nice it's really just a random selection of musicnot necessarily soft or meditative."
2,Stopped working in 2 weeks,"Not blaming the seller. Things appeared okay at first but in two weeks it won't recognize the disc and reading what's wrong on the web, it's most likely the ""eye"". Not an expensive part to replace but kind of a hassle."
3,"Very mild, underplayed Brahms (and so is the remake)","The two Brhams cello sonatas are passionate works, but you'd never know it by Emanuel Ax and Yo-Yo Ma, who from beginning to end are mild to the point of being tepid. Clearly this represents their joint view of these geat works, because their later remake on Sony adheres to the same line. Perhaps Ax is duller here, but he's dull enough the second time around.What makes this CD so odd is that when they join up with Isaac Stern to play other Brahms chamber music, Ax and Ma are full of passion and life. If you want those qualities in the cello sonatas, however, you'll have to turn to Du Pre, Rostropovich, or Heinrich Schiff, all of whom stir the blood."
3,Mannered,"I have the Musical Heritage Society issue of this CD, which is the one in the picture. In all likelihood it is identical to the RCA issue. I was really looking forward to this album. Emanuel Ax is a great Brahms player, and Yo-Yo Ma is such a great talent. I'm afraid I was disappointed. The problem here is Ma. He bends and shapes every phrase to excess. Nothing seems natural. Throughout, his playing is mannered and not even as technically remarkable as he can be. Ax plays well in general, in so far as Ma's interpretation allows him to present himself. I can't tell if the sound engineering is in part to blame for the total impression. The piano sounds very good, but the cello sounds recessed and somewhat pinched in tone quality. This should have been a blowout of a recording. My favorite CD of these pieces remains Emil Klein and Wolfgang Manz on Arte Nova."
3,Only if you are clueless about running a business,"I checked this book out at the bookstore just because I was curious to see if it would contain what I expected, and it did. As a serial entrepreneur, I found the book of no value. However, if you know nothing about starting a business this book might help you. There are so many of these types of generic books out there that even for its intended audience, I cannot give this book a high rating.Read my other reviews for books for entrepreneurs and starting companies."
1,Mistake,"This doll was cheap looking and felt like it was made out of a paint tarp. It is really crinkly and wrinkled, was difficult for my 4 year old to color and was a total waste of money. Goodwill got it after one use."
3,Nice but small,"I don't know if I missed it in the description, but the book is too small for a coffee table book. The pictures are pretty, but I was hoping for a larger book."
3,Poor reproduction of photographs,"Unfortunately, the text in this photographic essay is more inspiring than the images. The problem is not with the photography, but with the quality of the printing. The inks are too dark, and the colors are ludicrous."
2,shows a little bit to little,this kind of photos require a larger format also the selection of pictures covers only a part of what I consider beautiful in the great land of California
2,weirdly gaudy,"This seems to have been the victim of photo-shopping: weird and improbable color, not much depth of field, really not my thing. Shipping was slow too."
5,Disintigrate And Ululate,"Gordon Sharp's vocal tracks for This Mortal Coil gave little hint as to the sound of what would be Cindytalk: if a soul's joyous reveling in its eternal damnation were to have a soundtrack, this might very well be it. And if everyone really were Christ, it would be a luxury indeed."
1,Didn't Protect Against Surge,"We were out of town and had some sort of power surge that tripped a ciruit in our family room. I reset the circuit and can get the power bar to power up, but the TV, receiver, DVD player and satellite box are ALL BLOWN. Each was plugged into the power bar and the bar identified everything as clean and grounded. No such luck. So now I have to replace a whole bunch of components. This will be the last Monster product I buy."
4,car over the lake album - even the name's great.,"Being 18, most would figure that i've never heard of these guys, but their wrong. i discovered this daredevil album along with about 4 more in my dad's old vinyl collection, and let me tell you, it blew me away. ""if i only knew"" is a great song, but ""mr. powell"" is the definate best on this album. This record is a must for any country-rock-bluegrass fan."
4,daredevil summer,"All of the music from O M D is excelent for a varity funtions,such as spooning in the car out in the woods amidst all nature.I have a questi0n for all who purchased the album as new product,is this the one that came with the insert ""45"" i,ve lost mine would love to hear once again.Hope all have as many good memerios as I when it comes to great music such as O M D and good"
2,the car album??,"Well all I know is They sure fooled us with Jackie Blue~! Whatever Happened? is this album before or after, I sure hope it's before if not they definitely went downhill!"
1,album,very disappointed with this product quality for the money! cheap leather imitation but what really made me angry is a note inside the album stating that it should not be used by kids younger then 12 yrs old and it mentions formaldehyde????? this is a baby album! why would someone think of using toxic chemicals like formaldehyde when making a baby album?
4,Cute and good quality to collect your 4x6 baby photos,"I searched quite a bit for a cute baby photo album to give to the grandmas for the holiday season. These days we are so digital and all my photos are sent via email. But the grandmas aren't that tech savvy and so for the holidays I purchased this album (and the one with the bear on the front in blue) and they literally cried when they opened the gift, displaying pictures from the delivery through present. Underneath each picture there is a space to write, so I described the photo. They really appreciated it! Only complaint I have is that the 4x6 photos will be oriented horizontally so for any vertical pictures, the album has to be turned to see it straight-on. But not a big deal. The quality of the album is wonderful - looks much more expensive than it is."
1,"quality issue, and could not use either.","could not find any of the promised ergonomic benefits in this keyboard.it looks like an attempt to keep making some old mainframe keyboard and sell it to market. it basically is horrible. could not get used to this layout, which is definitely not best for any heavy computer user."
1,Waste of Money,"I purchased a product that broke before the MFR warranty was expired. Mfr said it was ""normal wear and tear"" but this warranty wouldn't replace the product because it was still under the MFR warranty. Too bad for me."
3,It's an Extended Warranty.,"Amazon keeps sending me e-mails to review this, but how do you review an insurance policy until you have to use it? I gave it 3 stars as a way of saying, ""I don't know."" It could be good or it could be bad."
3,haven't really used it,"but since I usually get things broken, it would be very helpful for people like me"
5,GG A COUNTRY ROCK GOD!,"On this release GG brings back the bad and dangerous to country music.GG is the perfect person to sing of life's hard times and the low road of sorrow, suffering, drinking and hard living.Stand out track is the cover version of Warren Zevon's 'Carmelita', which in my opinion, is better than the original.Musically it sounds a bit like Hank Williams, Johnny Cash mixed with the truck driving music of Dave Dudley."
5,Archetype Design,"Vishu Magee has presented the mystical achetypes of Carl Jung in a most readable and understandable fashion. His presentation develops the archetype themes inherent in us all as spiritual beings and demonstrates how we can incorporate those archtypes in the design of our living spaces. Magee explains how we can make our house a vehicle for spiritual growth. He goes beyond simply explaining how these archetypes operate in our lives and everyday experiences. He explains how we and those around us are driven by the archtypes in everyday life and why it is important that we become aware of their existence and influence in our psyche, especially how they manifest in our lives - both outer and inner. Magee includes in the book a comprehensive planning guide that covers every aspect of creating a total environment for interfacing individual, family and community. This is truly a great contribution to spiritual, peronsal and architectural literature."
3,Architectures New Testament,"If there was a Bible on Architecture, ""A Pattern Language"" would be the Old Testament and ""Archetype Design"" would be the New Testament.That said, this book is only pointing you in the direction you need to go to discover what your dream house is. It does offer a few insights into what works and what doesn't but it did leave me wanting.Attend a Holotropic Breathwork workshop, learn meditation, take a Shamanic journey etc. Do what you must to discover what drives you, so you do not design a dysfunctional house.That said, I would still recommend buying the book. I do hope the author puts out a second edition in the future, with more examples of what works and what doesn't, and with lots of colour photos."
4,Loved it! Most songs are great!,This is a great album! I love the way Alicia Keys has combined calssical music with today's popular styles. It makes her music smart and interesting. This is a definite winner for those who enjoy jazz and/or classical music.
5,More like this!,"I have just purchased this CD and I love it, of course I love good music to make love to and this is one! I would like to purchase more but not many artist make romantic music, with all the great female singers, and male out there you would think there would be more. Buy this CD if you are a romantic at heart!I can't wait for the next one!!!"
2,Not the best 6th !,Those who think this a great performance of a neglected masterpiece need to sample other sources. Walter Weller (Decca) and Neeme Jarvi (Chandos) are far better than Slatkin who is just great with American music but rather light when it comes to Prokofiev and Shostakovich. Gergiev's recent live recordings of the Prokofiev symphonies has unpleasant sound in spots but his performance of the 6th is quite good. They ought to reissue the Ormandy recording stuck in Columbia's vaults somewhere. It's a rather romantic approach to Prokofiev but a great performance nevertheless. For some reason this work is difficult to bring off and probably will always be overshadowed by the more popular 5th.
4,"Must-have ""lively"" post-rock","This is great post-rock. It is a little less like the groups trying to create slow, ambient soundscapes. The closest bands I can compare these guys to is ""God is an Astronaut"" or ""The Mercury Program."" This stuff is a little faster-paced than the above. The other album from Te' is even better (""It Be The Thinking As 'The Song' Of Realistic Sound From The World Which Resounds""). Find it if you can."
5,Outstanding music from a master,"I got this for the Symphony No. 40, which was touted very highly. I find that the entire CD is excellent. The sound is perhaps a bit older-sounding but still very good. The orchestra and singers contribute greatly but the real star is Schuricht. For Mozart, he is better than Boehm, Jochum or Karajan."
2,Dubious Value,"Don't be fooled by the date (May 1996) in the book's description. This book was last updated in 1959. It, therefore, does not reflect the requirements of any modern building codes or take advantage of any of the latest research. For instance, the referenced ACI code is dated 1947, AASHO 1949, etc. The book still has a lot of practical information and historical significance but will require care in its use."
5,Classic album that takes me back to my high school years.,"I initially got this CD in high school in a CD case that I purchased full of CD's from a guy who may or may not have stolen them from inside a car. Karma being what it is, my case was stolen 15 years later and this disc (and a bunch of new ones) were inside that case. So, I had to have it again and here we are. These guys should have made it (and probably could have if they didn't water down their sound so much on their next, and of course major label debut, ""Dear You"") Either way, their first 3 albums (this being the 3rd) are great. Do yourself a favor and get this or Unfun. If you like it/them then get yourself Bivouac. Great songs and great memories attached to 'em."
5,What more could you ask for in a punk cd?,"This is my third favourite of Jawbreakers perfect discography and would be on my desert island disc list for certain. I was lucky enough to actually find this in a local HMV (which is very rare) so picked it up not really knowing what to excpect (already owning bivouac and Dear you!) without doubt one of the most influential bands out there along with the likes of the clash or Steve Tilston according to taste. Pick it up you wont regret it. Stand ou tracks include Indictment, ashtray monument, ache and Jink removing."
4,"Good, but pales in comparison to ""Bivouac""","There are some absolutely brilliant songs here (""Jinx Removing,"" ""Outpatient,"" ""Boat Dreams ...""), but overall it hasn't ever struck me as deeply as Bivouac did.Of course, that's just me. You can't go wrong with /any/ Jawbreaker record."
2,Fails to deliver what the title promises,"I am sorry to say this book was a disappointment. The premise is terrific but the author misses the bulls-eye by quite a margin. The writing style is labored and the use of italics for every person quoted becomes tiresome. The attribution info is completely mystifying. I was hoping for a chapter from each featured person with specific life lessons he or she learned from their interaction with a horse. Instead, Ms. Witter repeats ad infinitum and ad nauseum, the point that some people are ""horse crazy"" or have ""horse fever."""
1,huh,"dont get me wrong, i love the movie as much as the next person, but who the hell would actually spend money on THIS?!"
5,Great Story!!!!!,"This is truly a great story. I would recommend to any young man who also enjoyed ""Where the Red Fern Grows"" as I did. I found this story to be completely absorbing and found myself unable to put it down. I was only disappointed that I had finished it as soon as I had. I wish I could find more stories of this caliber to read, even as an adult. This would be a truly great story for any dad to read to his son. It is as good of an adventure as the real thing and that is a difficult feat for any contemporary stories. I wish it had been required school reading, rather than what was required. Buy a copy today, it is a great purchase! If you don't like it email me and maybe I'll buy it from you."
5,Better than the best James Bond thriller !!!!!!!!!,"This is an incredible book, and insight into an amazing animal and its adventure in a year of its life to just survive. It is well written and at times I thought the Fisher must have written it itself, such is the detail involved. Thoroughly recommend it. The suspense reads better than a James Bond thriller for sure."
3,The play was good,I thought I could download my movie. I like the play but a I am little slow with technology. I would like to put the play on usb disk
2,The movie from hell,I did not like how the characters were protrayed. Their acting was to much drama for. You can do a movie on hell without all that drama. Some of the singing was nice. I would not recommend this movie . I want my money back.
4,"NOt Bad,,,","If you like most or all of these songs this is worth getting,,all great extended versions,,,otherwise you can find these songs on other compilations,,,"
2,"80's? Great! Extended 80's, Not So Great","I was looking forward to hearing some of my favorite 80's tunes but these are all jacked up ""extended remixes."" I'm ok with remixes but the way these were done basically they all sound the same! Techno-like effects with pieces of the 80's tunes thrown in. Thumbs down on this one, unless you really like techno and don't mind losing some of the actual song for the sake of a dance beat."
5,The very 12inch maxi-versions of the 80s - indispensable !!!,The very 12inch maxi-versions of the 80s - indispensable !!!
5,Fabulous!,"I finished this book in one setting. I bought it Friday, and it held my interest for the couple of hours that I read it. Yes, it has it humor, but I can relate to the advice given here. You have so many that want to marry up, but don't have skills or what have you to do so. I recommend it to all those looking for that special someone."
2,For college undergrads only!,"I was disappointed with this book. Based on the content of the book, if you have not snagged a man with money while in college, you have missed your opportunity. This book really does not give much input on how an entry level professional would marry up. Secondly, it does not help if you are out of the circle trying to get in. The author makes it obvious that she came from a background with money so it was much easier for her to attract a man with money because she is already in the circle. However there is no advice given to those who are trying to marry up. I would recommend this book to maybe college freshman but not for anyone else. It is a waste of time. I am glad I did not pay full price."
4,"Entertaining, quiick read","I was pretty pleasantly surprised that this isn't a sleazy ""reality show"" based book on how to be a gold digger. The book is actually based on how to find a quality man, with various different income levels. The ideas she gives for meeting and dating men of means are pretty good and the stories are entertaining. However I thought she really just glossed over how does a woman improve herself so that she's able to attract and keep a man. Many women don't really have a clue on how to successfully date a man. This book probably won't help much with that."
5,Great Book! Don't hurt author by bashing slow shipping here!!!,"Thank you for a wonderful book! Please don't be unfair, reviewers, and give a BOOK poor reviews because you are unhappy with shipping!!! It reflects on the author and lowers his or her rating when glancing at the book in a search. There are other places to rate Amazon as a business."
2,DMSO,Interesting book. Not one for the casual health enthusiast. DMSO sounds like a product that requires a lot of careful consideration before used. That did come out clearly in the book. I think it would be good for someone who has chronic pain that is uncontrolled by other means. Lea
5,Marvelous information,This book contains important cancer treatment information. The book describes other uses of DMSO for pain. I discovered this book through another book; The Politics of Healing by Daniel Healey. I think that the discoveries of Royal Rife should truely designate him the Scientist of the millennium not Einstien. Doctors have never heard of these men because they don't teach doctors to heal they teach them to treat symptoms with drugs.
1,This book did not give me the info I needed.,"Lots of science, but nothing practical for the home user. I've used DMSO for years and was looking forward to finding out more about how to properly use it. Didn't happen. Very disappointing. I'd do better with a Veterinarian's guide."
3,"Lots of Info, but lacks formulations","This book has a lot of background information about the journey of DMSO but, I was looking for suggested formulations for the specific conditions that DMSO can be used to treat. If that's what you are looking, look elsewhere."
4,Good Information,I was amazed to find out all the things that DMSO is good for. This book has a wealth of information. All my questions were answered.
2,These Walls Can Talk,"This CD is the excact same CD as ""Deadly Game"" every song is the same they just have different names. I am so mad i just wasted 15 dollars a cd i already have. it is like remixes it is just the excact same thing with a different name, if you have deadly game then don't buy this one. if you don't have either get one it doesn't matter which one though cause they are the same. It bad enough It was anogher greatest hits album but then to put it out again under a different name! I can't believe it. Can't wait for the real new stuff from X Sac-A-Indo"
5,It may be the same....,"THIS CD MAY BE THE SAME AS DEADLY GAME BUT DEADLY GAME IS A BOOLEG, XRAIDED GETS NO MONEY FROM IT. IF YOU ARE GOING TO PICK UP A CD GET THESE WALLS CAN TALK INSTEAD OF DEADLY GAME"
1,"Dumb DOS program, no DVORAK support.","How hard would it be to support DVORAK? A hundred lines of code would probably do the trick, since no new graphics would be needed. Just cross-reference the keys to make finger positions right, and you're done. They're resting on their laurels, selling a clumsy DOS program that takes over your monitor as if it were still 1989."
2,The awful music and near-sarcastic voice was punitive,"The way Mavis Beacon worked, at least in this edition, was by using the punitive method. The music and almost sarcastic-sounding female voice was irritating beyond description. It really focused the mind on ending the pain by learning quickly."
4,Those Bedroom Eyes,Enjoyed the movie. Probably would have been rated PG13. No nudity or bad language. Picture quality was a bit grainy.
4,Bedroom Eyes,"This was also a pretty good thriller. It Stars Tim Matheson and Mimi Rogers. You'll ask yourself is she a blackwidow or some crazywoman, or is she dreaming this. He is someone that's wife has died and he meets this woman and the rest you'll have to watch. I wont give it away. I recommend this also."
4,"Good music, bad mixing.","I'm usually impressed with Dennis Sands's mixing, but he must have fallen asleep at the controls with this one. The music sounds like it was recorded in a garage, and there's an awful lot of hiss in some of the tracks.As for the actual music, I prefer the first film's score but Elfman doesn't disappoint. I'm not too fond of the different approach to the main title (again, the first film did it better) but at least it wasn't the same old thing. I'm looking forward to Elfman's efforts for the third film; hopefully the mixing is a lot better."
3,Hotmail nor Yahoo would work thru the router,The Hr314 was a breeze to setup but wouldnt let me access my hotmail nor yahoo accounts through my DSL. I downloaded the latest firmware and am still in the throes of dealing with customer support on how to resolve this issue. Seems the model MR814 also had a similiar problem with that router. Buyer beware.
4,HR314,"I have had this product for 2 months now, I have had no problems with it, the set up was extreamly easy. My only complaint, which I should have known, is that the signal degrades fast, especially thrue walls(due to it opperating at the 5MHz band). In the same room I get a 54Mb/sec connection, 40ft and two walls away I get a 6Mb/sec connection, which is fine for web surfing (Roadrunner = 1.5Mb/sec). I just have to bring the laptop into the room with the router for file transfers."
1,Worst battery life ever,"My unit did not work at all initially. I was going to just dump it but I decided to try charging it for another 36 hours. At that point, it finally turned on and I was able to listen to music for about 20 minutes before the battery went dead again. Even after recharging, it went dead after an hour or so with the unit turned off! What a nightmare. This was the first product from Amazon that was broken upon arrival. It was not worth the effort to try to return it."
1,Lousy battery. Poor quality even at this price.,All I wanted was an inexpensive mp3 player to use in the gym. My last one (Zen Nano) broke after I dropped it and I wanted something a little more robust. I assumed that the low price had to do with the lack of bells and whistles on this very basic player but apparently it is a reflection of the quality as well. The battery life is horrendous. It only lasts an hour or two in use and seems to drain over night when the device is turned off. The controls are difficult to use and I was unable to get it out of stopwatch mode with hitting reset. There is definitely a niche in the market for a tough little no frills player but this does not fill it.
3,It's an MP3 player,A decent player for the price if you toss the ear pieces that come with it and use a pair of sony's. You won't get the volume or sound quality you're used to if you don't do this. Controls are a little funky to use with a complex menu system that takes some practice. The radio works OK and is accessable through the complex menu. It is nothing special. The player semi-permanently attaches to the arm band. It does not have a pouch from which you can remove the player without removing the arm band. I liked my old RCA Lyra that I'd used for about 4 years much better.
3,could have been awesome,"I was looking for an mp3 player with a stopwatch so that I could time myself jogging. This has a stopwatch on it, but it is completely useless because while in ""stopwatch mode"" you can't change tracks or even adjust the volume. If you want to turn up the volume, you have to go to a different menu - which would not be a problem, but when you come back to stopwatch mode - it's reset to zero. The reality is that when you are working out sometimes you need to change songs, or at least adjust the volume because of external noise, track volume differences, etc.Otherwise its a great device, I suppose battery life is a bit shorter than I am used to, and you have to endure an occasional ""please wait"" message when you navigate the different functions. Its cool it has a radio, and easily synchs up with audilbes.com. The stupid stopwatch issue is very frustrating though - and it doesnt even have a clock to time yourself with. Hopefully they'll come out with an update."
3,Bad luck,"I bought two of these because I really like them and had bought at least three from Wal Mart over time. However, the ones I bought on Amazon were junk. The buttons were not correct and they failed very early. I believe them to be used and sold as new. The packaging seemed to support this belief. I have been very happy with most things I bought on amazon but these were junk. if I had confidence I would buy three right now!"
3,No Display Outdoors,"You can barely see the display on a cloudy day if you shade it with your hand. On a sunny day, forget it, you have no display.That and not having a clock are my only complaints."
2,Beginners only,"Although this is a nice thick book, I didn't find any information in this book that couldn't be found just configuring Windows XP and using the help file. If I knew nothing about TCP/IP or DNS it would be helpful. Also, the CD is just the book on CD, it doesn't include any utilities or neat things for windows.If you know nothing about computers this book might be helpful. If you have been using computers and need a resource book, look somewhere else."
3,Underwhelming,"After I listened to another recording of the Kindertotenlieder plus the Rückertlieder by Karajan with Christa Ludwig, I found this one very dissapointing. The phrasing seemed arbitrary - unlike the highly controlled yet natural phrasing of the Karajan/Ludwig recording. The overall effect of this subtle and beautiful music was lost on me."
2,unsuitable recording venue,"I bought this many years ago and while the performances were okay (good but not great) and of course the music I did not like the record and didn't play it much. About ten years ago I realized why: this was recorded in a church, with typical dull sound and poor detail and no orchestral colours. I only started to recognize the problem of church acoustics then. There should be a warning symbol on every classical record that was recorded in a church. The sound is always inadequate, colourless, unsubtle and horrible."
2,needed for class,"i dont know what to write here. it was a required for a class i took, and i didnt even read it. sold it back soon as class was over."
4,Malcolm X: By Any Means Necessary,This is a very good general biography of Malcolm X. It is very concise and easy to read.
1,"Very funny, just the same as ANY OTHER version","This is an in-your-face imitation of the actual ""Romanza"" album. Don't buy this one unless you want the gold trimmings on it for double the price of the American version. The only thing changed about it was the gold made for Andrea's Australia visit last year. Just get the US version and save your money."
5,LISTEN TO S.L.J.C.O.A.A.A.T.R.!,"YOU HAVE TO LISTEN TO S.L.J.C.O.A.A.A.T.R.!HE'S THE BEST!HE KNOWS EVERYTHING!READ ALL HIS REVEIWS AND SAY""YES THEY ARE HELPFUL""!"
4,Great Sonic Show,"Let me start by saying that this show is great! Perfect for any Sonic fans, young and old. The storyline is half decent, rarely seen in 4Kids's shows. If you love Sonic, you will absolutuley love this.Episodes in Volume 1 include....1. Chaos Control Freaks2. Sonic to the Rescue3. Missile Wrist Rampage4. Pure Chaos (and episode that will kick of the new season of Sonic X this Fall. Let me tell you, this episode is based on Sonic Adventure)Though, many things bring this down.1. It's 4Kids, which means chessy puns and cruddy dialouge.2. Voice acting gets annoying.3. Most people don't know why they stuck Chris in the show.4. Most people think the first season sucks. Though after the second season, they will show episodes based on Sonic Adventure (one included in volume 1), Sonic ADventure 2, A Team Chaotix Episode, and episodes based off Sonic Battle.So if you like Sonic, get it. But if you aren't a big fan of Sonic, stay away from this."
3,Edited-only dub. Yuck.,"The first two Sonic X DVD releases have come to the shores. There's a problem though, and that's the content on each DVD. The dub of Sonic X is below-average, and kind of goofy: the script varies from accurate to inaccurate, most of the cast's voices are off, the editing goes from okay to bad, and the Japanese music is replaced.On this DVD, we've got four episodes: ""Chaos Control Freaks"", ""Sonic to the Rescue"", ""Missile Wrist Rampage"", and ""Pure Chaos"". As to why they skipped from Episode 3 to Episode 27 (even if it is a ""Bonus Episode"") is beyond me. But it gives a nice preview of the next season.This DVD is good for fans of the dub, or kids. The price is great, so I might pick the two up. 2 Stars for being dub-only but the price (around 10 dollars online) brings it up one star."
1,Good but uncut is waaaay better,I have seen this sonic series edited and I thought it was good but I also have the uncut version. (...) The epasoides are so much better.Also on the back of the edited it says 7+ but on the uncut it say 13+.This is a good sereis but uncut has swear words more viloince and brieif sexull jokes.But uncut not this.
2,Should've never happened,"This show is no good to the Sonic series. It recreates moments and environments from the games very badly. Why didn't they just hire the same people who did the voices in the games? The guy who did the cool, punker Sonic voice for the games auditioned for voicing on this show. But guess what, instead of his great voice they hire some idiot that makes Sonic's voice sound totally retarded. The show is reall corny, unnesesary, and unneeded. All the voices are bad, they add some new characters, and that's just dumb. Do yourself a favor, and just throw out any Sonic X DVDs and Sonic Heroes(see my review for that), and pretend that neither of them have ever happened.""I'll never look back. The world doesn't wait for me. I choose my own path.""Sonic(Sonic Adventure)"
1,Dubbed & cut version ONLY! :(,"I'm not going to even waste my money with this DVD. The origional uncut Japanese episodes are funny and whitty, but when this series was cut and dubbed for U.S. audiences the dialog became really stupid, and they even changed the music! I say wait for a professional uncut subtitled release. Even push for it! I can't watch 5 minutes of the dubbed version without shaking my head in disgust at how poorly it was done."
5,WHAT?!?!?!,"cool job whoevr made it but...WHY DID U HAVE TO PUT A KID IN IT!!! IT made it NO FUN!!! but i gave it a 5 anyway because i like seeing knuckles and the other characters! COME ON A KID?! Its ok though. When i saw that first episode for the 1st time, im like...why did u have to put a kid in it?"
3,4Kids' Attempt at a TV Tokyo anime,"Well, 4Kids did a good job for this anime (but not all that great). But to be honest, out of the animes under the 4Kids label, this would be the only best 4Kids dubbed anime.I mean, if you understand how 4Kids handles their animes. They don't have a really good record of doing their animes. First of all, they cut the japanese intro and make original intro themes of their own from unknown U.S artists (rather than japanese artists). Where as if Bandai Entertainment or VIZ picked this anime up, they would keep this anime intact with the japanese version (with Ryan Drummon at the helm, voicing Sonic and the rest of the crew of the U.S version of Sonic Adventures 1 & 2).But I'd have to give them some credit, cuz this'd be the only anime I would watch that's from 4Kids. The rest of 4Kids animes would be a waste of money (except for the Pokemon movies)."
2,"Good show, horribly edited.","I've been a hardcore Sonic fan for years, and finally we have a new anime based on the hedgehog. Unfortunately, as someone who has seen and owns the Japanese version on DVD, I can't really recommend this to only but the hardcore fans. The show suffers from bad editing. (Most notable is the absence of the Japanese sountrack, which is replaced with a much inferior soundtrack.)It's not unwatchable, however, and any hardcore Sonic fan should give it a shot. I'm sticking with my Japanese DVD's though."
3,Disappointed,"I saw Sonic X in Japanese before the dubbed version hit tv here.I was a bit disappointed that the original music and many of the fantastic jokes were taken out for the dub, they were part of what made the series so great and I found the show less enjoyable without them.When the DVD came out, I snapped the first two up in the hopes that it would include the original Japanese as well as the dub. It does not.I will not purchase another SonicX DVD unless it includes the original Japanese episodes.I do not enjoy the dub half as much as I do the Japanese.Aside from that failing, it's an entertaining show, and the DVD plays well, even including a bonus episode.It simply isn't as great as it could have been."
4,"""Spit these Bars"" iz a good preview of whatz 2 come","Drag-On represent NY 4 all of us dat come fr. nyc (whereva, brooklyn, queenz, uptown, harlem..., manhattan..whereva) wit ""spit these Bars"", a phat track. other songz on da single r okay (down botton remix not as good as the original--Yung wun needz 2 step) but bye it if u cant wait 4 opposite 2 H20 (march 14)"
3,Not as good as the original Rudolph!,"That movie wasn't really that good. Hermey, Bumbles, Clarice, etc weren't in it. When that caveman thingy sang ""It's Raining Sunshine,"" I almost wanted to swing my baseball bat at the tv.The reason that I gave it 3 stars, was that it wasn't as bad as THE NIGHT B4 CHRISTMAS ans FROSTY RETURNS."
1,Horrible,"I wish there was a choice of 0 stars, 'cause that's what I'dgive this movie. This isn't a rudolph sequel because all itrevolves around is time, fairy tales, and nonsense.It should have featured the old characters that we grw up with,but instead they decide to mix together a troll, ben franklin,a knight, baby new year, and fairy tales to create a horriblemovie. What were they thinking?"
1,A TROLL! IS THIS REALLY A CHRISTMAS SPECIAL!,"This has an ugly troll and it doesn't even mention christmas.it should have included old characters ( herbie, snow monster, e.t.c ) and none of the other things ( troll, ben franklin, knight, e.t.c ).DON'T BUY THIS IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A CHRISTMAS SPECIAL!"
5,Kids now a days just do not understand the classics.,This is one of the greatest Holiday movies ever made. This ranks up there with all the Classics from years ago. I love those ears and who can not laugh when they see that bird!!!!! What about the three bears. I am sorry but I LOVE THIS MOVIE. Everytime I see this movie I smile from ear to ear and I know it is Christmas and New years time!!
4,i liked it - the six yr olds liked it - wife said it was annoying,"Reviews were mixed ... The plot seems contrived, and not as cute as the original inspiration ... But it is still entertaining for a family style new years eve celebration."
5,Forgotten Classic - adored by another generation,"I spent entirely too much time looking for a digital version of the original Rudolph to watch this Christmas with my two year old. I finally broke down and bought a DVD and lugged out a DVD player for that one. However, having this version as a digital copy meant our son could watch it any time on his kindle fire, the TV or mommy's tablet (which ever wasn't in use). He actually liked this better. I think Eon was slightly less scary than the Bumble, and he really liked the baby. There is a limit to how much a two year old can learn, but he definitely ""got"" it isn't nice to laugh at people. ""Mommy, it not nice to laugh at baby. They making baby sad."""
1,Very Bad Product.,The belt width its too small and to thin. And the belt it's not 100% leather. The buckle looks cheap (not solid). Only the embose looks good. Friends of mine said that the belt looks cheaper. I'm not recomended to buy this kind of belt.
2,"Looks cute,low quality","My daughter was so eager to get these, however they are not what you might think. Only the two outer wheels light up which she did not like. They ""feel"" cheap. If your child is not a brand new skater I wouldnt recommend. My daughter was falling bc the wheels do not turn smoothly. She is used to the faster ones at the rink. We will be returning them. The skate is cute though."
2,SKATES,"These skates look great because they light up. However, the wheels do not roll very fast and my daughter didn't like to use them. She is used to the skates at the roller rink that roll very smoothly with ot much effort. The seller did get them shipped quickly and the price was good."
3,Not meant for bedtime,"The music on this CD is beautiful, but it is not quite right for bedtime. I had my little girl all snuggled in and just as she would start to get sleepy, the music would get very loud and then go soft again awaking her. We did this about 5 times thinking it would get better, before I finally turned it off. I plan to use it in the car instead."
1,Wakes you up instead,"This CD was supposed to be soft, easy music that would help you go to sleep. I did go to sleep almost immediately but not because of the music--I was just very tired. However, the music actually woke me up a couple of times when it got just a little louder. Maybe it's me, but I didn't find this product to do as promised."
3,Okay...,I use this for my baby's bedtime as it's better than the synthetic sounds of Baby Beethoven.
1,Adidas Women's Supernova Cushions Running Shoe,"This model of the Cushion is NOTHING like the old model!!! It is not as wide, not as much cushion in the heel......very disappointing."
1,Less than par,"I purchased these shoes over a year ago, wrote an unfavorable review about them and funny enough, my review has been removed and somehow, the shoe is back on my list of items to review. Hmmmmm. Anyway, I DO NOT recommend this shoe to anyone. Very uncomfortable. The upper back part of the shoe comes too high up on the ankle and causes burns and blisters from the friction when walking/running. The shoe does not fit snuggly around the top of the foot so once again, the friction from the foot shifting creates blisters. If you absolutely have to have these shoes, I highly recommend you purchase separate insoles to provide extra support and shock absorbency because these shoes have NONE."
4,Supernova Running Shoe,Very comfortable shoe with excellent arch support. Would recommend to anybody who wants a great running or walking shoe.
5,If you like soft squishy shoes....,these are for you. comfy all over comes in widths. So wonderful for daily walking.
5,a really great read,"John Fante was a great writer. I was introduced to his books through Charles Bukowski. I have read most of his available works. West of Rome is a great book. It contains two novellas. The first one My Dog Stupid is a glorious tale. Fante really captures the feeling of Italian Americans in the early part of the 20th Century. Some may not like the ethnicity but to me it lends a heartrending realism to the stories. The reader will probably feel the emotions of the characters as they tackle life problems. (I almost feel like Bill Clinton here: I feel your pain, man) The story revolves around a family with kids finally grown and setting out for life and their parents adapting to the changes. The dog that enters into their life becomes a motif for the changes in their world. It is a beautiful tale. The second story The Orgy is not as good but it is still classic Fante. This is a grossly underrated writer."
4,interesting,"this is an interesting tale- whatever your situation in life is, this book makes you feel better due to all the hardships the charecters go thru-"
1,Waste of Time,"Fante seems quaint and offensive by today's standards. Another wholly disappointing offering from a mediocre writer, like a second-rate Steinbeck best left to obscurity. With so many great books out of print, why is every chicken-scratch ever penned by this drunk hack-writer in print?"
2,ODE DE SEWER,"FIRST PURCHASED THIS PERFUME(EDIT SPRAY)WHILE IN EUROPE,THIS IS A RIP...HALF A BOTTLE,AND THE OROUR,SMELLS LIKE A RIP-OFF.DID NOT SPEND A FORTUNE ON THIS THOUGH,SO U GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR IS ALWAYS TRUE."
3,Nice look but....,This set has a great look but be prepared it is much heavier to maneuver than it appears in the listing... not recommended for senior with arthritis...
2,If you like to lift weights---,"then these plates are for you. Each plate feels like it weighs about three pounds, with nothing on it! You will not like carrying a loaded plate, salad plate, bowl and cup to the table. OTOH, you will be building muscles while doing so, so that is a plus, I guess. The set looks OK, actually looks good, but the hard edges and corners are not as cool looking as the more avantgarde, rounded square sets, for me. If you are into serious tableware that may last forever and has a definite commercial, restaurant feel to it, then I can see that these plates may fit your bill."
4,NICE.,"Love these plates- they are super durable (as i knock them about in the sink and drop them on the daily), generously proportioned, and make your food look great. Only cons are that the corners of the larger plates are too wide to revolve in my small microwave, and also they get a tad hot in the mic. But, these are minor inconveniences. I have never had a better looking, more sturdy set of dinnerware. At such a reasonable price, you can hardly go wrong."
4,A good selection ...,"Not a lot to say except that this is a very approachable selection ... not too demanding, but a stimulating variety. A good addition ... get it ... and for the money it's well worthwhile."
1,What a rip off!!,"If I could give ""0"" stars, I would. For 15 picks, they want $2.33 each? For what? A piece of plastic and a bit of floss. Oral B ought to be ashamed. Their factory outlet store is just as bad."
5,excellent flosser,My wife and I really like the hummingbird flosser because it vibrates which is good for the gums and you can carry it with you where ever you go. Also the flossers are strong and do not break as easily as just the regular dental flossers do.
5,Oral-B Hummingbird Flosser Refill,"I have a Hummingbird Oral-B Flosser and cannot find refills locally, thus the need to order. I feel they are extremely expensive but I can't get them anywhere else. So, the product is excellent, but the cost of the refills is exhorbitant."
4,couldn't find it anywhere else,have rx'd this product for my patients for years. was unable to order it through usu. rep. Oral-B rep told me to look here. Prices were better. Hope they last.
1,What happened to my beloved hummningbird flosser???,"Ok, it's Oct 10, 2011 and I'm on my last hummingbird flosser replacement head. I can get one head to last around 3 months and I bought a big pack of about 30 of them for $4 or so many years ago. TO MY UTTER DISMAY, I couldn't find any replacement heads at Walmart, Walgreens or RiteAid this morning. I come home and go online to find out they have been discontinued. WHAT?! Why on earth did they discontinue this perfect product? I never used a battery in mine to make it vibrate, but the size and grip of this product was ideal for flossing. I go online and find that people are actually selling replacing heads for 20 TIMES AT MUCH as they use to cost! Crazy! I guess I will just have to find a new flosser. Still can't believe they discontined this perfect flosser!!!! Bring back the hummingbird! Please, I beg you!"
1,"Love the product, but the shipping charges are ridiculous.","I really like these flossers, but the shipping from this company left me in shock. I ordered 5 packages of them. They want $21 to ship them. That is truly excessive."
1,Yuck!,"I saw this in the Grocery store this morning, and I thought 'Hey, why not get a healthy snack instead of these chocolate mint cookies right next to it?' Worst snack decision ever. Seriously. It's like eating seasoned Styrofoam. A great substitute for this snack would be a glass of water and breathing... that'll be a better and tastier experience."
3,WHERE'S THE SINGLE,"I WOULD SAY I WAS A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED *BUT* IT WOULD HAVE BEEN ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO TOP HIS FIRST ALBUM, ""ROME"". THIS GUYS VOICE IS AMAZING WHATEVER HE SINGS. HE ALSO DOES A REMAKE OF AN OLD KENNY RODGERS SONG,""SHE BELEIVES IN ME"" OVERALL ITS NOT A BAD FOLLOW-UP ALBUM BUT WHAT I DONT UNDERSTAND IS THAT I HEARD HIS FIRST SINGLE ON THE RADIO ABOUT 50 TIMES AND THE SONG'S NOT EVEN ON THE CD! ANYWAY, HIS FIRST ALBUM BY FAR ""WITHOUT A SHADOW OF A DOUBT IS THE MOST ELECTIFYING"" CD I HAVE HEARD. JUST PRESET 2-4-5-6-8-10-12 AND LET THE MOOD TAKE OVER WITH YOUR LADY OF COURSE. HIS VOICE, THE MUSIC, IT'S AMAZING YOU'LL SEE! THIS IS PROBABLY A BETTER REVIEW FOR THE FIRST ALBUM, HUH?"
3,"Not A Dissapointment, But Not As Good As the First","this cd is okay, but no way does it compare to his first cd, which is like the tightest cd full of slow jams, but how could it top it anyways. there are about 3-4 good tracks and a few decent ones. worth checking out, but if your a first time listener to rome, buy his first cd, it's the bomb!"
4,pretty good...,"I bought this unit so that I could have something descent to put in my newly remodeled room. It works as expected, although I would have liked something a little more compact, and the remote is a nice feature too (even if it is really dinky looking). My only other complaint is that The Bass could be a little deeper, and the sound could be a little louder, but I'd definatly recommend this unit to anyone interested in a quality boombox on a low budget..."
1,failed device,The CD player failed just after the warranty expired. Radio reception is poor. This one's going to the Salvation Army.
5,Richter!!!,"With it's recent remastering (and reduced budget price), the Richter stands up valiantly to the more recent and pricier fare (Zimmerman, Thibaudet, etc...). And if you like Richter's approach, this is a no brainer.Compositionally, these concertos are NOT the pride of their gender, but Richter and Kondrashin makes the most of what's there. In the first concerto, for example, the movements were combined to form a one-movement work, which to me sounds structurally stronger. (Little things like that makes a BIG impression!) Enjoy."
5,The best Liszt recording available,"This is the finest recording of these works, particularly the amazing sonata. At mid-price it is a steal. Richter's performances are electrifying in the more frenetic moments (such as the opening of the sonata which grabs you by the short hairs and won't let go) but beautiful and elegant in the slower parts. Sound quality is good. This is the place to start a collection of Liszt recordings and essential for anyone who likes Liszt or great piano playing. (P.S. If you think you don't like Liszt but like Mozart, try Liszt's paraphrase of Don Giovanni recorded by Bolet or Ginsburg and you may get hooked)."
5,On the Lizst piano sonata,"Might I mention one performance that Jeffrey Lipscomb omits - that recorded live in Budapest 1960. It was issued as a Phillips Legendary Classics CD, 422 137-2. The cd is a sort of twin to the 1958 Sofia Concert but has always been very much harder to find. This is my favorite of the recordings I know.There is also a performance in the Chopin/Liszt box from the Authorised Recordings collection, Phillips again, 438 620-2. The minimal information claims it was recorded in 1988 but I believe it is the Livorno 1966 version."
2,Not exactly a string quartet,"Calling this a ""string quartet"" tribute is a bit misleading, on two counts: firstly, (and granted, this is a nitpick) the traditional string quartet comprises two violins, a viola, and a cello (no bass or other add-ons); the second shortcoming is much more serious.Other than the solo violins, most of the music has been produced electronically--that's right, the ""quartet"" is made up of a couple of violinists accompanied by a computer! Anyone who buys this recording expecting to hear the Canadian power trio re-invented by classical musicians is getting ripped off. Is it any wonder that the front cover describes the ""artists"" as a generic ""string quartet,"" rather than telling you exactly to whom you're listening?The arrangements are actually not bad at all; it's a shame that whoever put them together didn't feel the need to hire real musicians."
2,"Lots of potential, little delivery","Find a place that will let you listen before you buy. I have been a Rush fan since Moving Pictures. I have spent 7 years playing percussion in a concert band and orchestra. As a previous reviewer has noted, this CD sounds like a midi tune from a web page. It has a limited number of instruments playing the music, which makes the music seem hollow or thin. The arrangement, while developed, falls short of all expectations that I had for this CD."
2,"Well Executed, but....","The execution is there, but a lot gets lost in the translation. First of all, I think most Rush fans would agree that there isn't any part of their sound that could be removed. The obvious lack of translation of Neil's percussion immediately takes away a great deal from these songs. Secondly, I miss the energy and kick that help make Rush such a great rock band; these songs feel rather ""toothless"" in a sense. The classical interpretation just leaves me feeling hungry for the ""real thing."""
2,Extremely poor musicianship,"Rush's music should have translated a lot better that this. Notes are not sustained when they should be, the music sounds very thin, simplified, and without feeling. I've heard Yo-Yo Ma play one cello with so much feeling that it could make you weep. Maybe a full orchestra could have duplicated the full-bodied nature of their music."
1,What? WHAT?? This is Weirder than the mind can comprehend,"I've loved Rush for almost 20 years. I've loved classical music for longer than that. I love most forms of music, but...However -and however...This recording should go to the top of the ""What were they thinking?!?!"" stack and stay there until all the (supposedly) sentient musicians attached to this project buy up every copy and chop it into little bits with garden shears.Did you listen to the snippet from YYZ? Un-freakin-believable!!I'm in favor of sharing the greatness of Rush with all who have not yet heard them, but this is NOT NOT NOT NOT!! the way to do it."
5,A New Appreciation,"As a classical musician and teacher, I have listened to and performed a multitude of pieces ranging in a multitude of styles. I am also a Rush fan and have been since the 70s. I was introduced to ""Exit Stage Right"" by a student of mine. I liked the CD so much that I bought six copies, 1 for myself and five as Christmas gifts for family members and friends. The arrangements are brilliantly scored to achieve an excellent adaptation from electric bass, electric guitar and drums to a much more physically demanding and challenging acoustic/fretless rendition. I must say that these performers are amazing and this recording is as good as it gets from an orchestral standpoint. This is a must have recording for any Rush or Quartet Aficionado. I recently received my Recording Academy Ballots for the 45th Annual Grammy Awards and saw that this CD is up for Instrumental Pop Album Of The Year... It is definately getting my vote!!!"
4,Great music for a Rush-loving doctor's office!,"Having just seen 2 Rush concerts in the past week, I still have live Rush sounds and sights in my head that return and resonate when I listen to String Quartet Tribute to Rush. With that disclaimer out of the way, I highly recommend this album to hardcore Rush fans as well as the casual listener. There are no jarring keyboards/vocals from Geddy, nor any brilliant Peart drumming, but if you have the songs imbedded in your acoustic memory you can fill in the blanks to please you as you wish. Standout songs IMHO are Red Barchetta, YYZ, The Trees, and Freewill, but no song is unlistenable. Regarding the title of this review, I may very well keep this CD for years so I can use it as ""office music"" if/when I own my own practice someday. Some visitors will appreciate the ""classical"" sound, while others may recognize the rock origins of the music. It's not ""Something for Nothing"", it's something for everyone!"
2,Strung Out,"I recently purchased Exit...Stage Right: String Quartet Tribute to Rush in the hopes of hearing something spectacular. I realize the instrumentation in a string quartet pales in compairson with that of a full symphony, so I'll resist the urge to compare this with Us and Them, and instead I'll focus on this disc. I'm disappointed. I'm sure I'll get flamed for this, but many of the songs sound like those (lovingly crafted, mind you) midi files you can download from Rush fans' web sites. YYZ sounds particularly computerized...almost like something you'd hear in a n 80s-era video game. To my ears, the music of Rush would translate extremely well played on ""classical"" instruments, but this disc unfortnutately suffers from a major case of not being able to get past the language barrier."
2,Rush deserves better treatment...,"As a lifelong RUSH fan, I have a very high opinion of their music - particularly their songwriting. No chamber music could capture their muscianship, but this recording doesn't do their melodies justice either. Much as I love their music, this recording didn't do it for me."
1,What... You've got to be kidding...,"--I call this ""tribute"" an insult to rush and all of their fans.I've never felt so strongly about something suckin' so much that i had to post a negative review about it.In fact i've never writen a bad reveiw about anything, figureing to each their own, but this is like blasphemy.In short.... IT BLOWS!!!(The only reason I gave this 1 star is because it is required to rate this in order to post, and 1 is the lowest option....they need to add zero as an option.)"
2,Stop The Madness!,"No, no, no, no!String Quartet People: please go back to what you do best and leave rock-n-roll alone.Guitar Hero Shredders: please leave Bach, Beethoven and the other masters alone!Enough said!"
3,"Great information, a little bit outdated","I would recommend this DVD, so long as you aren't paying the full price for it. It will help people take that next step to becoming a better player, but it won't get you there. It has some good information, although i did find it funny on how she criticized Daniel Negreanu's play (although she didn't mention his name). Overall, it was OK. Some good advice to take in, but nothing crazy good. I would recommend for beginners to people who are trying to get to the next level."
5,Learn Some Great Tells,This video was alot more than I expected. Please if your a guy or girl this is a must see!! The tells she gives you are awesome and really helped my game. This is more than just a girls video. If your a guy I promise you she will give you valuable stuff to improve your game. Awesome video. I watch it again and again.
3,Good for the Price,"Good for the price at $9.95 and for long boring flights with Harry Potter in-flight movies. Annie does have some interesting tips, but nothing most serious players haven't already figured out. Just kinda validates what you already know.The video is a little boring. Honestly, I must confess I haven't made it all the way through the video yet. Maybe the best tips are in the other parts I haven't watch? The other problem is that the DVD was obviously done on the cheap. At several points you can hear people walking down a hallway behind Annie Duke. You wouldn't think it would matter, but it makes it harder to watch than it should be."
3,"Good, but not that good.","After reading the reviews I was very eager to watch this DVD. Granted that when compared to others on the market it is a cut above. However there is nothing really new here, and believe me th e pro's are NOT worried by any information on this disc! For me, Annie only starts to touch on the advanced concepts of layers - what cards do I have, what does my opponent have, what does he think I have etc. The rest is the usual Caro tells, implied odds etc that you will have read in any good book. Worth a look but its not as ground breaking as I had been lead to believe!"
3,Annie Duke Review,"Great DVD, definitely for more advanced players. Poker basics required to follow video properly. She has years of experience she shares about player strategies, betting strategies, reading other players, etc. I learned great insider information from this DVD that helps with every hand I play. A discounted copy would be a valuable part of any poker library."
5,A great lesson if you just started.,"The short and simple is,if you just started playing(to win)this is a great DVD.If you don't know what hand beats what well it may be to much to soon.If you have been playing for years you probably already know this stuff.If like me,you've been playing for a few months and are doing OK but need help to the next level this is a very good buy.After she talked about a subject I felt like I understood it better than I did.There could have ""been more to it"",but for the money I put in and the return I got I feel I made a good call."
4,Worth the money,This video is produced in the best fashion however the information is beneficial and is worth the money.
3,good but too short,"great advice on tells, but it is way too short. She spends a lot of time explaining why this dvd is only for advanced players but doesn'tgo through many topics that an advanced player thinks about. What she is good at are seeking ""tells"", and pretty much thats all she delves into."
2,Informative but difficult to watch,"I purchased both of Annie Duke's DVDs. The information is valuable but as a No Limit player, I found the discussion of both Limit and No Limit distracting.My BIGGEST COMPLAINT is that the setting is identical to a funeral home, including the crimson velvet curtains framing an urn. Ms. Duke wears the same ugly shirt throughout both videos.I would really enjoy these DVD's if they were produced in a visually appealing setting, and if Ms. Duke changed her peasant blouse. It is unfortunate that so much good information is wasted by poor production."
3,Homegrown - Unfazed Mermaid,"A good double album of trip-hop tunes, although none particularly stand out. The album is split over 2 cds: the 'Mermaid' cd has vocal tracks and the 'Unfazed' cd has instrumentals. 'Unfazed' is a little more realized than 'Mermaid,' but a few songs like ""My Kinky Pink Room"" stand out. Not a bad effort overall -- good for background if nothing else."
5,Great!,"This album is a must for any Steven Isserlis fan. Although the pieces in this album are so diverse, Isserlis plays everything with great zest and enthusiasm."
2,disappointed...,"Sorry guys but I thought your book was not comprehensive and it confused the heck out of me when I read it couple of years back. (John Sharp- C# step by step is an excellent book to learn OOP).I took this book as a teach yourself/ intro to OOP and unfortunately the authors didn't do a good job with their intended audience- people trying to learn OOP. Plus there were multiple bugs in their code, which was not helpful."
2,Help - I'm confused,After spending heaps of time sudyinh the UML - finally a book that brings OOP - UML and VB.NET together. I was wrong. After 1 chapter where the code doesn't match the examples in the book and where saving visual basic id actually .vb I am thouroughly lost and confused.
1,high expectations,"i bought this bra bc i am newly pregnant and my boobs are KILLING me. i know, its not a maternity bra per say but strapping them down is all i was really looking for and since oprah recommended it, it must me amazing...i ordered a 1 (bust between 36-39 & rib cage between 31-33) i'm actually bust 34D & ribs 28 but i thought i'll get bigger. upon wearing it, yes like other reviews say it does make you flat but that is a welcomed change for me : ) however i couldnt hook the bottom 3 hooks bc it was SO tight on my ribs it was painful to breath...and thats at a size up of what i actually am. bc of the price i will wear it like that to bed until it falls apart."
2,Guess I'm not big enough,"I am a 36D, and have a terrible time with sports bras. I decided to give these a shot, and got a size 1. Technically, I should be in the range... but when they arrived, the band was really tight, but there was space in the cups. I was moving all over the place, so I returned them"
4,Excellent Bra for Plus Size Women,"These are the only kind of sports bras that provide me with the adequate support that I need in order to exercise. They're expensive, but well worth it!"
2,poor dimensions though good control,"I bought this bra for $79. I do think it gives decent bounce control (42D) but the band is too tight if the cup size is correct and is giving appropriate bounce control. In addition, the straps are far to short for anyone that is taller or has a long torso causing the bra to either slide up or cut into the shoulder. I actually took a pair of scissors to mine lengthening the band by two inches, adding a 2-3 inch strap extension with extra soft padding on top of the shoulder. The final sewing adjustment was to trim the top 3 hooks and create a bra that is not similar to wearing a straight jacket. Waste of a lot of cash."
5,oh. my. god. BUY THIS BRA.,"To all you women out there with more than the average bust - listen to me. I am 44DD and take a cardio class with lots of running, jumping, and other boob-unfriendly activities. I was in pain from things bouncing around and nearly gave myself a black eye during each class. Stop laughing! It's true. I found info on this bra on some runner's forum and I think to myself huzzah! this is what I need. I looked online for local retailers (sorry Amazon, my next one will come from you!) and went to get one. My god! the difference this bra makes. I wore it today to my cardio class and came home with no pain in the bust! I love this bra. Yes, it fits snug, so if you're used to the way your regular bra fits, then this will be a little different. Nothing moves in this bra - not during jumping jacks, not running in place, not doing kickboxing. BUY THIS BRA - YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT."
1,Does not work as intended,"I have large breasts, larger than some but not the largest, 40 DDD. This bra did not even pass the bounce test. I put it on and jumped up and down. FAIL. I like to run and do Turbo Jam and even Zumba, but with the way this bra is I doubt it would have even held up to my Zumba classes. Back to the drawing board. Does anyone know of any great support/sprt bras out there?!"
4,LOVE LOVE LOVE,"I ordered this based on reviews and it holds up to what everyone says. I am currently a 38DD and the ""girls"" are supported. I didnt have problem with them hurting bit was embarassed when they bounced all over the place. The sizing chart did say for me to get a size 3 but i ordered a 2 and it holds good!! Happy girl!!"
5,"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this bra! & not afraid I'll get stretch marks anymore!","I am a 38 DD and I absolutely LOVE this sports bra! FINALLY a REAL sports bra with REAL support. I have never had my ""girls"" stay put when I'm exercising and to be frank I've avoided exercise for years because of it, sounds vain I know but I didn't want to break my breast tissue down or get stretch marks. I have no more worries about either issue because Enell keeps them fixed in place. I'm SO thrilled this bra came out, it sure beats all the other worthless so-called ""sports"" bras on the market that are more like leisure bras if you ask me."
4,This is the Best Bra for larger women,There isn't another one out there that compares...if you don't want bounce than get this one. The only reason I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I think there should be rows of closures so when it stretches out..you can make it smaller.
4,Great quality!,"I just received this bra and I rate it 4 stars just because it is tight, as mentioned in the other reviews. Otherwise, it looks good, and it seems to perform well. I like the fact that it closes in the front. I will keep it and I hope it will loosen up in time."
3,Didn't Surprise Me...,"I didn't think that purchasing a collection of Kansas hits was anything but something that would get us all revved up for a local concert here in Abilene, TX and I was right. Kansas' number of hits doesn't make for a two CD set of hits..."
3,This CD Misses The Mark,"A great band from my home state. It's just too bad that this collection doesn't include ""All I Wanted"", ""Power"", and ""Stand Beside Me"" from their tenure with MCA Records. However, if you'd like clean, updated remasters from their CBS/Kirshner years, then this is the collection for you."
4,The best part? The re-mastering,"I baught this CD for one reason, to hear the songs re-mixed with a better sound.It is good and very crisp.You can realy crank it up!I have to agree with the other review however and say that the ""compilation"" thing has run its course.Enough already!My 4 stars are for sound quality and having all the songs on one CD. Two songs that are not on the cd that belong there are ""ICRUS"" original.and ""Miricles out of nowhere"" This would have really made the cd complete. These two songs could have easily taken the place of the ""pop"" hits ""hold on"" and ""fight fire with fire"" Anyway, buy it for the re-mastering alone."
2,Not compatible with Win7,Learned the hard way that this version of Family tree maker is not compatible with WIN7; Had to re-install operating system as it would no longer respond to links after removing noncompatible software. Works great in Win XP
5,Great Information,"This book is loaded with informative and valuable essentialinformation that anyone in the field would find enteresting, and would be of extreme benefit to those entering the field.I found each chapter well written, easy to understand, and not cluttered with useless information.The Unit on ""Synchronous Automatic Motor Starter"" was of particular interest to me as I have operated these machines before.The section on ""Developing Control Circuits"" was also exciting for me as I have worked on storm drain pumping stations, and sewage lift stations which utilized the two pump alternating scheme shown in Figs. 2 thru 6.The solid state theory and circuits was excellent.This book makes for great reading, and I recommend it for all hands."
5,Required Information,I teach a course for a manufacturing plant for a customer and reviewed many editions of this book. Upon the review I decided this 4th edition covered all the information necessary in teaching as well as the best delivery of the information.
2,Not the Real Deal...,"For those who want to know the fundamentals of Automated Industrial Systems under the heading of Electrical Motor Control... This text of ISBN 0-8273-8640-0, I can not recommend. There maybe better text that I am not aware of, But ISBN 0-8269-1663-5 from 1987 is a text you can grow with. I'll be upgrading to ISBN 0-8269-1675-9 by Gary Rockis & Glen Mazur. Sincerely, Industrial Maintenance Electrician of 12+ years. I will post an additional review once I have viewed the upgraded edition. (I've wondered about these reviews... Are they posted by a PR / sales people???) Good Luck & Be Safe."
2,Gunsmiths of The Carolinas,"This book is more like an index and Bibliography to various other references, except there is no index in the rear of the book by name of Carolina gunmakers.The book starts with a general synopsis of the history of guns in this peroid which may be of interest to researchers.There is not much original material cited except excerpts taken from many other sources.The book appears to be lacking in links to northern makers in VA or PA that settled in the Carolinas.There are no pictures or descriptions of any example guns.Not a bad reference, if you need basic information or a point of reference for further research, but not worth the price asked in my opinion."
2,Always preview before buying!,"I had not seen this book before, but was familiar with the illustrator's work on the Little Acts of Grace book. The text of this book is very nice, but a bit wordy in places, however,I was extremely disappointed with the illustration on page 35. It shows Jesus on the cross with blood pouring out from his wrists going into cups being held by two little angels. The expression on the one angel's face is one of apprehension and almost fear like. It is totally too graphic and disturbing and I will not use this book with my students because of it. Too bad to have just one illustration ruin the whole book."
3,Good for 3-5 grade.,"I got this for my daughter getting ready for Holy First Communion. The reading level is still very high, and the book is thin and flimsy."
3,Unfortunate illustrations,"Oh dear. The text is lovely, but the mice scattered throughout the illustrations do not reflect what the text is trying to convey - the beauty, importance and sanctity of the Mass. Having the FANTASY of a mouse with angel wings pictured right next to the MIRACLE of the Consecration seems particularly irreverent to me.The Mass is REAL and MIRACULOUS. The anthropomorphic mice suggest otherwise and are a disservice to the text."
1,Great book but what were the authors thinking????,"This is a VERY well written book, I think they could have added a few more definitions for kids but overall fantastic...except for a photo on page 34, ""The Mystery of Faith"" where there is a drawing of JEsus dead on the cross with blood pouring out of his wrists and angels collecting it in chalices. WTH? Not that the photo didn't freak her out but my 4 year old asked, ""why are the angels collecting Jesus blood in cups"". Other than that disturbing scene I liked it very much. Too bad I couldn't add the photo for you all to see."
5,Erotic Poetry at its Best,"This book is a perfect collection of poems, many times as sweet as they are sexy, to be enjoyed over and over again. Mr. Michelman weaves the physical and emotional joys of love with a splash of vulnerability to craft thoughtful verse.I highly recommend Peanut Butter on Bagel or Breast. It would make a great addition to any nightstand. . . a little bedtime story, anyone? Looking forward to more from this poet."
3,Cranky Marrissa!,"I enjoyed the beginning of this- you know, it started out with a family party/gathering and it all seemed like a nice, warm, loving family, so I liked them :) I loved the dialogue between the hero and the heroine, I loved that she was an intelligent spit-fire who knew what she wanted. I also found the fact that the hero couldn't get over their first night together (as arrogant as he was) so sweet. The second half of the book was just kinda meh for me. Marissa became too weepy for my liking ( for just cause, yes, I was a weepy old soul during my pregnancies too so I understand but...) It's a good book all in all, not my favorite but still one of the nice ones."
3,A ROMANCE JUNKIE,"This book was great, I loved Marissa very tough and outspoken- Cullen was also wonderful. I liked the fact that this book was written from the mans point - interesting and fun to read."
5,Romantic Times Magazine,"""CLAIMING HIS LOVE-CHILD is a truly remarkable love story. The constant of the romance novel genre is the obligatory happy ending but in a carefully executed and refreshing twist, this keeper really offers some suspense as to whether Marissa and Cullen can work things out and overcome the many roadblocks standing in their path to true love.""Shannon Short, reviewer"
4,a small gem,"This is a delightful look at a wonderful place and a marvellous cast of characters by one of our most talented living poets. I don't usually find myself yearning to move to France, but after reading The MAYS I couldn't help myself! Merwin's language is uniformally beautiful & he makes both his people and his places come alive. I also enjoyed both the fragments of songs that Merwin translates for us and his discussion of the difficulties of translation -both across language and across time. My one critique (and the loss of a star) is that I wanted more. Each time I felt that the ""story"" was REALLY going to start we would shift gears & go somewhere else or talk about someone else, and after a while I gave up hoping for any conclusion or resolution. This may be the product of some arbirary editorial length (I note that the book is part of a travel series) but in any case it is a pity, as I could easily have read twice as much on half as many troubadors!"
3,Disappointing,"Much of the first half of the book (after the first chapter) is little more than a listing of various fauna and flora existing at a particular time. The second half shifts to listing all the species rendered extinct by humans. A few quotes from Jared Diamond's much superior ""Guns, Germs and Steel"" indicate he has read that one but missed a few points."
4,About That Index,"I think other reviewers have pretty well covered the book. It's certainly a very interesting read.I'm kind of an index nut. Some non-fiction authors provide very weak ones. This one is good, but surprisingly misses some important key phrases and words like ""founders effect"", his interesting Paleogene description on page 101 (paper back) and his references to dawn redwood early on. I certainly appreciated the color photos in the middle of the book, but, whenever I see such material in a paperbook, wonder if there was even more in the hardback version. Four leafs, 8 pages, were provided in the paperback. Anyone know if that's the same as the hardback? I've come across paperbacks that obviously had photos and figures that were excluded from the book. In some cases, that makes a big difference. I think I found two figures in the book. Maybe one. A few more would have been very helpful, partitcularly on extinctions and a few to summarize points."
2,"Basically, a rip off","I own this because I was one of the many who ordered it after it was advertised on the Cops TV show. I didn't know quite what to expect except that it was stuff ""too hot"" for TV. I didn't expect blood and guts, or X-rated stuff but felt it would show a slew of different segments. This video is essentially material they couldn't show on tv because -- in a few instances -- it was too violent or showed some nudity. But portions of this video were also shown on Cops, except with some editing cuts. Other portions of this is stuff that could be shown on Cops. I really felt when I watched this that I had been dumb to order it and others I lent it to felt the same way. I haven't even listed this on Amazon to sell second hand because, to be honest, I'd feel like I snookered someone else. Save your money, folks!"
2,Do NOT waste your eyes. time !!!,"It is a 38 minutes short video tape including scenes that can not be on regular TV because have frequent ""F, B words"", and brief nudity: fuzzy around ""without pants"" old male, topless women.It was nice to appreciate the strange and peculiar risks that law enforcing officers must face: on the loose cows, chicken, spitting, ugly dentures, those forced me to give it two stras, not one.Honestly, was nothing worth wasting 38 minutes."
3,Good Movie.,"This is another video of the ""Cops"" series. I always watch ""Cops"" no matter what. It's my favorite TV show. If you like ""Cops"", you've probably seen this stuff before. It's funny though. So rent it today. Then if you like it, buy it!Rated: NR (Not Rated). But contains Adult Language and Graphic Nudity. Adult Supervision is extremely advised. Thanks!Running Time: 43 Minutes"
5,Very Funny and Worth Buying,Excellent Video! If you love COPS the show then this is a must have Video for your collection
4,I never knew COPS could be this funny!,This is a very entertaining video! With the cussing at the cops. The embarassing clips are real funny! You've got to see this tape. Even if you don't really like the show. This tape is priceless!
1,You've Seen it All Before,"What a disappointment! If you watch ""Cops"" much, you've seen this all before, just with the expletives bleeped out and the nudity (ugly people anyways) blurred.For the cost of the video, you get to see what you've already figured out. Big deal."
4,Very informative for beginning breeders,"While I've had companion parrots for a number of years, breeding was something new....after talking to several breeders, my husband and I decided to try our hand at cockatiels. Prior to actually purchasing breeder stock, I visited a local pet store and purchased this book----it was the best thing I could have done at that point. The book is very good at explaining all the different aspects of breeding---I highly recommend it for anyone who is thinking about breeding. This book may not be for a companion cockatiel owner, with a lot of technical information that is not exactly an exciting read, but as far as knowing what you are getting into before taking the step of actually setting up an aviary it is a must have."
4,Great for the Breeder,"First, let me say that I am not a breeder. I just have a little cockie friend as a pet. I found the book to be informative, but weighing very strongly to the breeder and less to the new owner. If I ever do decide to breed, then this book will be a great reference. However, I found that it didn't offer as much basic information in detail that a newer owner would like to have as other books that are less geared to breeders."
1,Too technical,"As a new cockatiel owner, I found this book to be much too heavy on breeding techniques and the process of 'showing' your bird for competition. The book delves into diet, nutrition, and pet care but is written from a 'professional' point of view.The information is overwhelming in the book and I found it to be dry and technical. I believe that there are much better books on the market than this one for the everyday 'common' cockatiel owner. If you are a 'professional', you will love this book. But I dare say that most owners of cockatiels enjoy them for their company and not just for breeding/showing.This book is *definitely* NOT the bible for cockatiel care!"
5,Paris the heart of the artistic world of the 20th century,"all of the great modern artists of the 20th century were there. writers and musicians too. Pablo Picasso, Henry Matisse, Stavinsky, Hemingway, Josephine Baker, Gershwin, Chagall, Miro, and others who made the look of the last century so real. these are my heroes and people that i want to study about, still this documentary is about the point in time and space Paris when all of this was together and being talked about and created and each was working with the others and inspired by each other. WOW it just happened in history during the Renaissance and then in the 19th century with the Impressionists before the Modern Artists all came together. and thats what this film is all about."
5,Fabulous!,"Mark Twain travelled to Australia in 1895. A journalist reported ""He is in no sense a disappointment as a humorist. He starts his audience laughing in the very first sentence he utters, and for two hours keeps them in a continual roar"".This video performance by Hal Holbrook captures what I imagine my fellow Sydney residents would have experienced 114 years ago. It is a delight to watch, not only for a glimpse into the past, but also to hear this timeless storyteller relate a philosophy completely relevant to our early 21st Century."
5,Hal Holbrook as Mark Twain,"Saw this presentation years ago as a kid and watched it again now and its still great. Our kid enjoys it, too, so, Mark Twain (and Halbrook) hasn't lost his charm."
5,Mark Twain Tonight!,"I have been wanting a recording of this performance since I first saw it at age 12.It was a bravura performance by Hal Holbrook in his one man show.Excellent!I highly recommend this to any theater lover, and especially to Mark Twain fans.A wonderful performance."
4,Julie's voice is great,"I love to hearing Julie's voice, that's why I bought it. Of course, it's wonderful. Especially, ""On the clear day"" and ""Brigadoon"" medley are good. But I was disappointed at the suites of ""My Fair Lady"" and ""Camelot."" They has many numbers sung by Julie once. Some of them are great, the other are not good. I like this album, but compared with the original recording made by her, I prefer these albums to this one.But if you want to hear the recent Julie's voice, you must buy it. I hope her voice will recover someday."
5,good buy,"For the compact size it has good info...mostly on attractions, but no advice on resturants and hotels..."
1,Self-absorbed mysticism,"I picked up this book hoping to learn something about enlightenment, and instead learned only about the extent of Mr. Harvey's self-aborption and narcissism. In a previous book he recounts his discovery of the path to truth through guru Mother Meera. Ah, but in this book we learn she wasn't the path to truth afterall, he was duped, but as a result he has now learned the REAL path to truth. How do we know he's found the REAL path to truth...this time? He tells us he has! The author clearly has great credentials, with his scholarly Oxford background raised at every opportunity. It does not, however, make him an expert in all things of the heart and spirit. Mr. Harvey needs to step outside of his fantasy world, take a walk in the forest, and realize he's just a mere mortal like the rest of us."
1,Not what I thought,"To say I was distraught after reading this book is an understatement. The first 34 pages (the prologue) remains between it's hard covers on my book shelf. The remaining 270+ pages have been removed. If you are looking for an all too graphic, albeit tragic, gay love story, this is the book to buy. If you are looking for insights into a ""Dark Night of the Soul"" experience as I was, you will likely not find it here. Even the worthy message of caution against following false gurus was lost in this non-spiritual story. Harvey is mixing two issues here, sexuality (in this case - gay rights) and spirituality, in a manner that was very disappointing to me. I would like to think that the true path is a bit more important than what Harvey has made it here. I think he knows that too. I now know better than to buy any of his other books."
5,Checkers,Made a portable soft checker board to use when camping. Was unable to find checkers in any of the stores in my area. Ordered (3 packs) these & they are great.
4,A nice set of checkers,"These checkers are a nice sized higher quality set of checkers.The size and thickness makes them easy to handle and play with. My only criticism is that the stackable ridge is not as thick or pronounced as I would have hoped. But, they still stack better than my old set."
5,Wood Checkers with Stackable Ridge - Dark Brown/Natural,Wood Checkers with Stackable Ridge - Dark Brown/Natural is good quality item. Very good price. I like that it comes in a bag.
3,Noticeable defects on cheap wood.,"Since the price for this set was rather low, I wasn't expecting much. That's more or less what I got. There were noticeable defects on a few of the pieces, and the general feel of the pieces is quite lightweight. It won't surprise me if these warp easily.The draw string bag was well constructed, however, and all the pieces fit together and will function well as checkers. At $6, I wasn't expecting a family heirloom, after all.If price is a concern, you want wood, and don't mind imperfections, then this product is the way to go."
4,Great Product for anyone who has a LOT of music!,"I really enjoy my iPod. I got it about two months ago and already it is about 1/3 filled. The design is great and it allows me to listen to all my show tunes anywhere. However, there are a few details that can be annoying. First of all, the apple website states that with a fully charged battery (three hours of charging) one can play music for 8 hours straight. That is incorrect. After I charged my iPod overnight (eight hours) it allowed me about 3 hours of playing time, less that half of what was advertised. Another annoyance is that it gets scratched really easily. The coverplate on my already has some permanent scratches. Also, if you aren't planning on carrying more than 1000 songs, just get the iPod mini for $50 less. It's a great product."
4,Great product...here are my pluses and minuses,I have had my iPOd since Christmas and for the most part have been very happy with it. I have had fewer problems than friends who have purchased competing products.PlusesEasy and intuitive to useGreat organization of songsGreat soundLooks good--people notice it!Easy to download music--and I use WindowsMinusesThere's a slight pause between songsIf your car doesn't have a tape deck you need to purchase an add-on that is suppose to work through your car speakers... this has worked inconsistently for me.No search feature
3,It's just not for me...,"I purchased and apple iPod 15GB from my local best buy. i had it for about 15 minutes. I loaded iTunes. and it took quite a while to upload my music(not included in the 15 minutes). later, it said that iTunes could not convert 192 of my music files into MP3 files since they are protected WMA. makes sense to me. i burned all protected files to CD's and put them back on my computer. lo and behold, it will not support normal WMA files. I called apple and said the only other solution was to buy music, just so they can get a little more money. i dont know about the rest of you, but i refuse to fork over $192 just for some songs. Like I said in my title, if your music is files that will be converted into MP3's, this is your player. It's nice to look at, the touch sensitive features are a dream, files can be sorted, or all played at once, it has auto-sync, and iTunes is awesome. However, if you've ripped most of your music from legal CD's, I'd recommend something else."
1,DO NOT BUY,"DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. The battery only lasts in these for 18 months, then you can either pay $250 to get it replaced, risk the entire product buy trying yourself, or just buy a new one. I havn't heard of a iPod with a replacable battery, but I did hear they MAY do it. So unless you have $250 to throw away, it's for you. It is a great product, though. Just be aware of the battery."
2,Looks great but beware...,"It is definitely the coolest looking mp3 player on the market, and that is why I almost bought one. However, after trying some of my friends' ipods I realized there was really no reason to get one. The scrolling wheel is fun but difficult to use when you need to select an item. I always went past or stopped prematurely. The buttons are all really cool but you can hit them by accident very easily. Here are some more cons:-No PC interface. You need to buy a dock or other accessory to use it with your PC-Every song on the ipod MUST be on the computer. If you have 500 songs on the computer and put them in your ipod then hook it up to another computer...all the songs are erased.-You cannot upload songs from the ipod to a computer.-PRICE!!!! There are so many better mp3 players out there for a fraction of the cost of the ipod and you get more memory and more features.Overall...get a Dell DJ"
5,Great!,This technology is great!! You can keep sooo many songs on this. Its so small and portable. I don't have one but I've used one before for a month. I borrowed it.I keep wondering.....does an iPod have a removable battery?I want to know because I want to recharge the battery.
1,iPod,This item was shipped very quickly which was nice but it was extremely scratched up I would of been better off spending another 50-75 dollars and getting a new one that was never used for how bad this item was scratched up and the amount of money that was spent.
1,just wait,"Wait a bit and maybe Amazon will finally start selling the new iPods, which are smaller and have a longer battery life. Can't believe they're still selling these older ones at a price you can buy the new ones at."
2,Little Too Big,"I like that it can hold a bunch of songs, but it's kind of big to take with you too many places. The screen is hard to see on the go as well."
4,To the RETARD who didn't know what this is for.,"HEY DUMB ARSE! It's an MP3 player....not a friggin Record player or cassette player or walkman...god I shudder to thing of the consequences that happened when you tried to put in a casette....IT PLAYS DIGITAL MUSIC! You download CDs to your computer and upload the songs to the iPod you idiot....god...BTW i give this 5 stars because even though people complain about the battery life and durability....i'm more upset about the inability to download wma files, which most of my CDs transfer too. While iTunes is incredibly cool, I don't want to have to end up paying a dollar for something i already have."
5,I Love my Ipod more than my girlfriend,"Let's face it, this is a toy but what a great little toy it is. I don't know how I'm ever going to fill this thing up and it works great for running and exercises (I had had some misgivings before buyig because it was a hard drive and moving parts dont take very well to a person running). The back does seem to scratch easily so heed the warnings and buy a cover/case/jacket for it. DLO makes a great one that comes with a very effective armband."
3,"OKAY, but not really that great","i had an ipod for 15 days, then i returned it. i dont really find it that great.first, it had great design and layouts. Very easy to use, but i'm afriad you have to ""hold"" all the time so you don't touch anything wrong, in other words, the buottons are a lil bit TOO sensitive. i had to put it very flat on a table or keep ""HOLDING"" it.\but more importantly is it's sound quality. IT WASN'T THAT GOOD AT ALL. Alot of the songs i had played well in my iTunes, but not in ipod. Those songs had a lot of noises when they reached a pitch or got louder. Some of them couldn't even be listened at all, 70% of the track was jumpy and glitchy. not good at all. but i m still thinking if it only happend on mine alone.i m ordering an iriver coming a few days later, and i especially like its SRS and remote. i ll prolly write another review on that too and do a comparison.Over all, ipod is really nice from the outside, but just OKAY from the inside."
1,Please Don't Buy This,"I was excited to buy the 15 GB iPod after Audible.com was able to take off $100.00 from the already amazing price offered at Amazon. But let me tell you, my Dell Insprion 8100 crashed each time I tried to config. the iPot. I had to purchased a USB 2.0 card and it also did not work for the iPod. Ultimately, after I tried to do everything as instructed for the iPod, not to mention buying the USB 2.0 card and the additional iPod dock connector to USB2.0 + FireWire, I am going to return the iPOd, and try something else. Very disapointing!!"
5,ipod ROX,the apple ipod is the best music player in the world. I am a mac lover and i bet that this will turn any1 2 b like me.
1,Beware! Apple Warranty Service is nonexistent.,"Bought IPOD 15GB for my daughter. After 2 months the LCD cracked without any accidental injury to the unit. Apple refuses to provide service under warranty claiming the damage could not possibly be due to defect. They will repair it for $250 which coincidentally is the price of a new unit. Based on this ""superior"" customer support, I would advise against buying any Apple product."
4,Cool little scratch magnet,"i've had this for a few days now and love it. i've got tons of music and audio books on this and it's barely 1/4 full. the interface is intuitive and very simple to master. that batery life is pretty good, though no where near what they claim. (no surprise there) my main beef is that both the body and screan scratch VERY easily. at less than a week old it allready looks pretty beat up. typical of apple is they've totaly beat out the competition but didn't quite nail it. i'd have given it five stars if it didn't scratch so quickly."
3,tricky miracle,"The IPod is supposed to be one of the best Mp3 players out there. To some degree, i believe in that. The IPod lacks the battery life of many better mp3 players but has the style and look that will definitely have heads turning. In my opinion, an IPod is a statement. It shouts look at me, I have money. The IPod is deadly expensive and if i could turn back the hands of time, I'd rather get the mini. Don't be tempted into buying higher memory. There is no one that could possibly fill 20 gigs of songs up. The IPod has tons of technical problems. Often you will get the Apple screen and you're IPod won't turn on for minutes...hours..maybe days. The battery life is horrible. 8 hours is the span they give, but in actuality its more like 5. Not very practical, is it? You are better off with the mini. its more stylish, more practical, and hopefully has less bugs."
2,BATTERY LIFE IS VERY POOR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"From my experience, ""More than 8 hour battery life on a 3 hour charge"" has NOT been true. My ipod does not charge fully or the batter indicator does NOT work...nevertheless, I usually get about 3 hours of music (if that) per charge - TERRIBLE!I LOVE everything else except the battery life."
2,Why Waste Your Money?,"It's sleek and everyone likes the looks and its made from Apple so it has a brand name. It also has cool touch buttons but iTunes is a pain to mess with, its insanely fragile, and users basically have no warranty for it. It is also extremely expensive compared to other companies' mp3 players like creative lab. With that said check out everyother mp3 player before if you want to buy it or have a rich or spolied friend get it and see if it works for them."
2,Too many small issues to put up with,"This is the 3rd MP3 I own, and if it weren't for the large memory capacity I would rank it the worst I've had.1 - The touch controls are annoying and unnecessary;2 - I was suprised to find out that about a third of my songs would not play since iPod does not recognize the WMA format (SO BE WARNED);3 - The owner's manual is very broad and general and you need to go online to iTunes to get more specific info;4 - Attachments are very expensive and are not included in most packages;5 - Sound quality is pretty good."
2,"Short Battery Endurance , Battery has memory effect","I bought my new 15GB ipod at amazon here.The battery operation endurance is unbearably short, although the player has elegant appearance and awesome storage capacity.Charging One hour for operating one hour is my way to operate my Ipod everyday.I found the battery has memory effect, which means the battery cannot fully charged when the times goes on.Also the iTune which is the enclosed programme for arranging and organising songs or song list for ipod, is much difficult to organise songs than Winamp. Therefore, I recommend you to use winamp to organise song list and then press ""import"" song list in iTune to transfer song files to your ipod.If I were you, I would prefer to buy the new mini ipod. The battery operating hour may be longer than previous ones, I guess."
2,One Bad Apple,"I've had this item for 6 mos and it crashed 2x. Now, it can't find the hard drive. I have to send it back. It's been very disappointing. Apple does have a 1 yr. warranty - so, I'll see what that process looks like next. Also, it's lame that Apple sends the Firewire port and then, consumers have to go out and purchase the USB."
1,worst ever,"this is an absolutely wonderful device to listen to. the sound quality is great, the navigation is great, everythings good...when its plugged into a wall. this thing has the worst battery every. ive had it for 3 years and im on my 4th one. the battery lasts for 5 hours for 6 months. after that, maybe an hour. its terrible. dont buy this."
2,Don't get hard drive,"The hard drive i-pod I purchased for almost $400 died in 17 months. The drive as well as the battery. I was told to go with a Flash 'drive'. I was so disgusted with the Apple merchandizing mentality, I researched and now own an i-River Clix and I love it. Check it out before becoming chained to i-pod and i-music."
3,The ipod,"I was very pleased with my ipod for five months, until the screen developed a rip in it, with the rip in the screen you can not see where you want to go. I sent it in for the repair. They said that only happens with a blow to the ipod. I baby my player. So they basically called me a liar and refused to fix my ipod. So if you get one, I think you will enjoy the quality until something goes wrong with it. Good luck getting it fixed!"
1,Very dissatisfied,"I should have been tipped off when one store tried to sell me one of several RETURNED iPod 15gb's. I had to hunt down a USB connector, which is NOT widely available. I was pressured into buying a card to convert my USB1 port to a USB2. THAT wasn't cheap, and it was on top of the exorbitant price of this little piece of junk! Go ahead and laugh, the adaptor worked just fine in my USB1 port and I learned my lesson, although I let the store know I wasn't happy about being swindled when I returned the whole mess.Yes, after all that scrambling and downloading the right conversion software (which took hours), I was ready to return it for the time-wasted factor alone. I managed to get a CD put on and it sounded awful! It crackled, and nothing could fix it. It wasn't the CD - we checked. Then it SCRATCHED just by passing around the house a few times! I returned it with only a mild fight with the store I bought it from. People, save your money for a company that produces quality products."
1,S-T-U-P-I-D,"Okay, I got mad and threw it off a bridge and it broke. Stuff should be able to survive that. I couldn't even find one of the pieces. Piece of junk. Loved it until it broke. Apple should make their stuff durable."
1,Don't buy one!,"The ipod is great until something goes wrong. I used to own one 20gigs and then the hd went bad. $250 went to the garbage. The worse part is I hardly used it. I used it about 4 times. So, dont't buy one."
5,CRAP - GARBAGE,THIS IS WONDERFUL PRODUCT THE SYLE IS BREATHE TAKING. THE MENU BOTTUM GRABS MY ATTENTION THE MOST BECAUSE OF ITS TEXTURE. THANK YOU AMAZON FOR SELLING ME THIS PRODUCT I WILL NEVER FORGET YOU
3,Ipod,"I have an Ipod and i have to say i love it i can carry all of my songs in my pocket but there are a couple of things i hate about it it scratches like all the time, when you have polarized sunglasses you can't see the screen, it isnt heavy but it is slim and so it slips out of my hand alot and its really easy to drop, I love the music fact of the ipod but i think it is horribly made"
1,Great.....as long as it works.. (app. 3 weeks!!!),"Nice little toy, until it just dies on you... It stops working, and there is nothing you can do about it...User's Guide provides zero real troubleshooting issues. Don't buy this product if you don't want to get extremely aggrevated over a $300 purchase..."
2,Faulty after a few years of ocassional use,"I didn't use it very often, only to cook a whole chicken once a week tops. One day I smelled something hot when I turned it on, and it was this unit. It still heats up but has an electrical smell so I don't dare to use it any more. It's going into the trashI don't think I'd buy another one of these."
5,Moringa Oil,"Nuxe's hydrating energizing moisturizer is a rich honey scented cream with comforting elements. It soothes the skin instantly and absorbs completely. Jojoba oil, Moringa oil, Camellia Kissi seed oil, Soybean oil, flower extracts and oat kernel are the secrets in this healing cream. Once you try a product with Moringa oil, you may find yourself looking for more information. If your skin feels dry, this is one of the best creams and it is especially effective as a hand cream.~The Rebecca Review"
5,Love this cream!!,"This the second time that I have purchased this product and I absolutely LOVE it! My skin is dry and very sensitive to creams, lotions, perfumes, etc. The first time that I tried this cream, I was a bit hesitant to do so. It is very thick and creamy and it does have a bit of a fragrance. When I realized that I didn't experience any type of negative reaction to the product, I was sold! The cream is very moisturizing and my skin feels soft and looks luminous after applying the cream.The only complaint that I have is that the jar and lid are made of a hefty ceramic as opposed to plastic. Good for the environment? Maybe, but not practical for everyday use. I dropped and broke the lid from my first jar so I am being extra careful in handling this jar.Try this cream... You'll love it!"
4,A great indie debut...,I heard one of their tunes on a podcast a couple weeks ago and was hooked. I ended up being one of the hundreds of people at their record release party this past Saturday. AGENCY blew me away...I bought the record immediately and its been on at my desk at work since then. This album is a diamond in the rough...a winner!
1,Was Bach a Robot?,"This is a passionless recording. You could easily get the exact same performance from a computer. Bach was a warm, inviting and hospitable person and this recording shows none of that. If one takes the time to study the meaning of the WTC, one can easily see this aspect of Bach in the music. The preludes and fugues of the WTC, not to mention all the works of Bach, have the potential to be played in hundreds of different ways so to tolerate a recording that offers the nutritional value of iceburg lettuce is silly.Moreover, the piano sounds really bad. It took me weeks to listen to the whole recording.Another reviewer mentioned finding a recording on an instrument closer to what Bach had. Not only is the sound closer but the tuning is more accurate as well. Baroque tuning is a bit lower and when played in the lower tuning, all the pieces take on a much different meaning. Find a recording using harpsichord or clavichord.I threw this recording out."
5,Great recording.,"I looked for a good recording of this work after I heard a wonderful performance by the San Francisco Opera. I didn't know how to choose among the several available. I finally went with the tenor, Ramon Vargas, and the extra (i.e. third) disc containing an alternate ending by another composer. I am totally satisfied with the performance and engineering; but the alternate ending doesn't seem any better than the original. The love duet in the first act, between Romeo and Juliet, is terrific even when you know someone will be screwing the cap off the syrup."
3,Not as good as his later readings of Bruckner's 7th,"I am a big fan of Eugen Jochum, but this Seventh is nowhere near as revelatory as his later two readings. Compared to those, he kind of sounds amaturish and wayward in this reading from 1939. The sound is kind of boxey, but better than I expected. His late 60's version is light years ahead of this, but it still might be a curiousity to see how different this is from that one. I hate to bad mouth Jochum because he and Karajan are my favorite conductors of all-time, but stick with the later ones because they are interpreted better and in much better sound."
3,Science Fantasy,"This series started out strong, but it has gone on too long and is no longer interesting."
3,Illustrations are just okay but story is hard to tell,"I don't like that only portions of the whole picture are painted traditional oil color style. I prefer entire page full bleed color illustrations. The craft is otherwise excellent.But the story is more about the illustrations and then a story to accompany it...and not even at that, since only the first page has words and you are supposed to narrate the rest of the book. Although a board book this was not a winner in our toddlers library."
4,Beautiful illustrations,"As with the other two Carl the Dog books we have, this book has delightful illustrations and a whimsical story (told entirely through pictures since there is no text). My 18-month old son loves this series."
4,Wonderful for the imagination,"I justed picked this book up at the library. I think it's great to have the majority of the book with no words, just gorgeous, colorful pictures. The more detail in the pictures, the better, as my almost-two year old loves to ""find things"" in them. With no words, he and I can make up our own story, it lets him decide whats happening. I plan to buy a few of the series to have around all the time."
5,You won't want to put it down!,"What has brought Lauren to this wide spread territory in Texas? What is her connection to the old tycoon who invited her? Why did he invite her? For himself or is she to help him settle his son Jared? What does his wife Olivia think of all this? Interesting plot twists and turns, as usual for avid readers of Sandra Brown. And, of course, it wouldn't be Sandra Brown without some interesting, tension building episodes between the main characters, Lauren and Jared. Is it a mariage in name only? Or is there some passion? Could it actually be love?"
1,What was that?!,"I'm a huge SB-fan AND I like historical novels, so I considered this book the perfekt combination. But it was bad, bad, bad. First, the story plot is an annoying up and down of misunderstandings and yes-no-situations. Second, the plot is unbelievable, especially toward the end. Third and worst: the book is full of dislikeble characters (except the minor roles). Jared, the so-called ""hero"" is just terrible. He is rude, mean and abusive, but oh-so-handsome. So much for his qualities... Lauren and the other charcaters in the book tolerate all of his abusive behaviour, how sad is that. Lauren falls in love with Jared, an obviously mentally-disturbed male who makes everyone around him suffer and mistreats her. What a message! I really wonder what Sarah Brown wanted to tell her readers with that story."
5,"Wonderful adventure, really felt if it were me in the story","Sandra Brown is one of my favorite authors! I find all her books hard to put down. This one really puts you into the story. I felt it was me playing the role of young Lauren. There is romance, adventure, and mystery all wrapped up in this book. It is one that I will reread again in the future!!"
3,"Will reread again in the future, but not a keeper","I liked this book and the characters, but it wasn't great. However, after reading the existing 11 reviews I feel I should give the book another chance in a few months. I don't know why I didn't love it. Maybe the misunderstandings went on too long and seemed contrived. Regardless, SB is a fabulous writer. Try it."
1,Boring..Boring..Boring,"This is the second novel I've read by Sandra and I am truly dissapointed. The fires were definitely hidden, because I could not feel the burn. I found myself skipping over several pages at a time. The characters were not likeable, or I just couldn't connect emotionally with them. Also, when she (I don't even remember her name) realized she loved him seemed rediculous because nothing he did endeared her to him. I propably won't read anything else by this author because the price of paperbacks have gone up and I certainly don't have money to waste."
5,Tune into TLC for more,"I'm glad to see this show available on DVD. I haven't seen the recording but have caught all the Duggar shows on TLC. It's nice to see good quality programs on cable. They seem like a well grounded Christian family, and it's interesting to see how such a large family lives with daily pressures and also homeschool. They are a great example how God can sustain families when you put your trust in His provision. Way to go Duggars! God bless them...they're expecting #18 this year."
5,Wonderful DVD!!!,"I really enjoyed this DVD. It was a lot of fun to look back and see this episode again. I was a little disappointed that there weren't any special features or extras, but overall the DVD is a nice buy."
2,Duggar Fans,Our family really enjoys all the Duggar DVDs. This was our least favorite. I did not read the fine print and assumed this had several shows on like all the other DVDs. This was just a 1 hour special. It is a little cheesy and low budget compared to the other DVD/shows that they currently have.
4,Great to watch your child's development!,"We got this when our boy was around 14 months, or so, and it has been great watching him go from doing nothing with this, to learning how to dump all the pieces on the ground, to slowly but surely learning how to put each piece back on the frame!These are ultra high-quality wooden pieces, smooth to touch, with paint that does not flake or chip. The colors are bright, and the variety of shapes holds the child's interest.There are several different ways to put the pieces on the frame, and several different designs you can make.My son and I have had lots of fun with this, and he often points at the box on the shelf, asking me to take it down for him. Yes, the price is high, but you do get quality for the price, and at least for us, or son has really enjoyed this toy!"
5,Fabulous collection !,"If you like Debussy - whom I have heard called one of the progenitors of ambient music - you will love having his most inspiring and beautiful works together on one cd. These works are tranquil and serene, and yet they don't fade into the background - no matter what you are doing - because they are true art. When this cd is playing you can't help but listen and sigh. My cats love this cd, too."
4,An excellent choice,"I love ""classical"" music, yet my knowledge of Debussy isn't too in-depth. Nonetheless, this CD struck me as a great addition to my collection, as the music is wonderful and, of course, great for daydreaming.While Clair de lune will always be among my favorites, everything on this CD is great. Someone mentioned having a problem with ""Reverie""; while I've never heard any other interpretations of that piece, I still think the one on this CD is quite good. This disc is rather nice for relaxing; I'm playing it right now and it is exceptional as nighttime background music. I don't have any problems with recommending this one to music fans, as I'm glad I found it myself."
5,A tone bathers dream!,"This cd provides both great examples of Debussy's best technical works as well as an easy-to-listen to ""tone bathers"" delight! Whether you choose to listen for chord progressions or simply bask in the music's timeless peacefulness and relaxation properties...you will NOT be disappointed by this collection."
4,Not too bad,"Claude Debussy is my favorite composer. I first listened to his music my freshman year in college 23 years ago and have been hooked ever since. I enjoyed this CD but have one major reservation. The rendition of ""Reverie"" was played by a pianist who obviously had someplace to be in a very short while. Maybe he had a ""duelling pianos"" thing going on with a friend to see who could play it fastest, or maybe the pianist was a very talented 10 year old who suddenly realized he had to go to the bathroom. The phrasing and dynamics were good, but the piece was played way too fast.This was too bad, as ""Reverie"" is my favorite."
3,Kavanagh,Want to find out what it was really like in Ireland just after the turn of the (19th) century? Want to know what language really sounded like? Read this lovely charm-filled little book by the author of Raglan Road.
1,NO TONY & NO GOOD!,If Tony Jaa is in this this then I missed him...Looks like a poor quality home movie with terrible acting. Wish I could give it 100th of a star....Maybe it's a comedy....
3,not as pictured,I bought this in the Hula baby print to go with my daughters nursery. When I received it in the mail I found the print was exactly what I was looking for but the ties on top were different. Instead of having the one tie at each end for a total of 2 it only had one in he middle. A bit disappointing.
5,A Great Place to Start,"Ammons passed away recently, leaving behind a great body of work. This volume is one of, if not the, best example of his short lyrics. His word-play reflects a deep respect and understanding of the word as well as nature. The publishers chose a great book to republish in honor of his death."
2,Valet tray serves purpose but inelegant,"Serviceable but disappointing.The valet tray consists of a flimsy inner tray, in burgundy velour, fitting inside a shiny clear plastic outer section. The plastic is ugly, not suitable for a dresser, yet the velour compartments are too flimsy to work on their own. The better thing would have been to design a sturdier velour tray."
3,Review of 'Ayre',"Some of the selections were interesting. One or two, very interesting but overall, so-so. Upshaw is wasted on this one.Occasionally 'atmospheric'."
4,A book for Romanov enthusiasts as well as hopeless romantics,"Oh my lord. I adored this book! The love story between Mikhail and Natasha parallels with that of his cousin, the Duke of Windsor and Wallis Simpson. I found myself crying my eyes out over this story, especially during the quotes from Tata about what kind of a father Mikhail was to her. I also admire Natasha for her strength of character-imagine, having the courage to go and tell off Lenin like that! I"
2,Disappointed,Excepted a luxurious product for the price. Scent is not very strong. Soap any different than a bargain brand soap.
2,How To Raise Your Own Salary,"A rather contrived, mediocre book that is commanding high prices in the used book market. It is a conversation between Napoleon Hill and Andrew Carnegie concerning priciples of success. You can find the same information (at a lower cost too) in Hill's famous book, Think and Grow Rich."
2,Largely A Cacophonous Yawner,"Well, I was really hoping for a lot better when I ordered this one. Perhaps something a little more melodic. What you get instead with Bosonossa and Other Ballads is mostly a lot of disconnected and discordant noodling.Although there are a few places where the music shows promise, that promise quickly fades. Its mostly a cacophonous yawner.I own several other Tomasz Stanko CDs that I greatly enjoy. While this is not entirely without musical merit, I'd not have missed anything if I'd never heard it. If you are new to the music of Tomasz Stanko, steer clear of this unless you are into the sort of jazz here described."
2,A wooden Haydn,"For those listeners who are enchanted or put off by Mr. Koopman's sometimes outrageous interpretations of Bach's keyboard music, here his utter lack of spontaneity can only disappoint. Listen to the famed D Major concerto - the cautious tempi and the omni-present mechanical noise hardly suffice cover Mr. Koopman's lack of ideas for this music. The cadenzas are laughable, with Koopman contenting himself with a couple of verbatim quotes, and basta cosi!"
5,Cute,Super cute. I like how it is focused on just a few kids and describes each of them a little. This type of book opens the door to discussion of these cultures with younger children.
5,A great book for beginning and experienced astrologers.,"In this book, Arroyo takes all the complexities of modernastrological symbolism and boils them down to basics. Hiswriting style is clear and uncluttered with jargon. This isnot a ""cookbook"" to be referred to again and again forthe author's interpretation. This book teaches thefundamental priciples of signs, planets, houses, and aspectsfrom which the student can proceed to make her owninterpretations. A real gem."
4,Insightful approach to combining astrology & psychology,"Stephen writes for the growth oriented astrologer. Not a book for beginners, yet one you will use contiually as a reference as you develop your skills in understanding major aspects. Indepth analysis of important aspects between two or more charts for those interested in synastry. I've had this book on my shelf for twenty years & still find it insightful."
5,An Elegant Energetic Approach to Astrology,"Astrology, Psychology, and the Four Elements is a great astrology book, an all-time classic. Author-astrologer Stephen Arroyo is a gifted writer, but what really stands out in this book is his ability to succinctly describe the essential (or energetic) meanings of the elements, signs, and houses. His keyword descriptions are very helpful for chart interpretation.Arroyo's elemental-energetic paradigm catapulted astro-psychology to a new level. It is an elegant framework, based on energy, that will elevate your understanding of astrology and improve your chart readings."
5,Read the book Anders Aslund tried to smear!,"Yes, it's right, Anders Aslund, former advisor to the Russian Government under Yeltsin, took quotes out of context from Reddaway and Glinski's book in a futile attempt to paint Reddaway, perhaps the most prominent authority in the world on the Soviet dissident movement and the abuse of psychiatric hospitals under the Soviet regime, and Glinski, a prominent figure in the democratic movement in Russia, as fascists...in any case, this book is by far the best that has been written telling the truth of Boris Yeltsin's tragic turn to the right -- to the mafiya and to old figures in the Soviet nomenklatura, and the accompanying turn away from the democratic movement which brought him to power.This book is a must-read for anyone who wants to go beyond the pronouncements of the American foreign policy establishment that Russia is on the road to democracy and learn what really happened."
1,Buyer Beware,I received a defective unit and it is a PAIN to return this product. I'm told you can not directly return to either Amazon or the company that sells it through Amazon but rather it has to go back to the manufacturer. The whole process is very poorly documented and cumbersome. Next time I'll go to a physical store and buy another product.
4,I like this FM transmitter/charger,"This is my first time I am using an FM transmitter for my Ipod 30GB. I read lots of reviews on various FM transmitters and decided on this one. I say it works pretty well and is easy to use. It is great to be able to listen to the songs that I like without any commercials. I do have one small complaint and that is on occasion I do hear some static in the background. Living near a metropolitan area, Washington DC, probably has something to do with that or at least that's what I have read or been told. I do find that 89.7FM works the best for me with minimal static. I'm glad that I purchased this and do recommend this product."
2,Too much work required,"This device requires too much tweaking. All stations sound scratchy. At times the sound comes in clear, but the majority of the time it just has too much static. Not worth the money."
1,Not too good,Static too loud. Hard to get sync'd with a freq. At times it works but those times are few and far between. Way too much $$$$$ for the performance I have seen.
2,Very Disappointed,"Bought this based on the only review posted at the time and wish I had waited until the other ones came. Seemed like I had to find a new station every 1/4 mile, there was a lot of interference and static and it wouldn't stay on the menu to show which song was playing. Kept going back to the original screen. I sent it back. Was happier with the Monster and will be getting that one again as soon as my card shows this one was credited."
3,Does the job minus some bells and whistles,"This is a fine little system that runs warm but will stay alive if you don't put it on a shelf with an enclosed back. The volume is decent, but for action movies and football I find myself putting it at around 39 of 50 volume setting.Here's the kicker, the system doesn't decode DTS so Blu Ray will need to be converted to PCM Downstream (a less sophisticated sound decoding that seems to skip occasionally on this system). The audio will cut out for a few seconds every once and a while, which can get annoying over time.A decent system overall, but definitely a starter that will be replaced if you watch a lot of Blu Ray"
2,Pretty good system if......,"Item bought on 7 March 2010 and returned 3 weeks later. I read the reviews on this before buying it and they weren't to good but i decided to give it a chance anyway. I bought it for my dorm room in which it performed well until the reciever went out. I am not sure why it went out because i never blasted the music. For the short time that it did work, it was really good. I ended up sending it back and buying another brand system (Coby) for about $30 more which I hope is a lot better. Cheaper brands are better for me because im in a dorm and don't really need a Sony or other expensive brand name."
1,piece of junk,"bought this from Walmart- the one w/ no dvd player- didn't need that. Turned all way up to max (50), it was not loud enough even with optical connection to my dish tv. I finally gave up and my 2 10 watt speakers on my sony tv - not even turned all the way up-- were significantly louder than the 1000- watt stereo system. The system came with an FM antenna, but no connection on the end of it, so it can not be connected. Also, when I hit skip forward on my dvr, the speakers pop every time. The system has no connections on the speakers, so if you have any problems with the wires, you have to throw the speakers away. I'll be returning this one next week and doing my homework and buying something higher quality. On my other TV, I have a Samsung 1200 watt. I've never turned it even close to full volume and its way louder than this RCA. Doesn't seem like an extra 200 watts should make this much difference, but this system is not worth buying."
2,"Sounds OK, didn't last very long","I bought one of these 3 months ago at the local WalMart. For the price, it was OK. I hooked it up with my Direct TV dish setup. The sound was a little weak on some movies. It has several variations of the surround sound from sounding like a stadium to being in a Church along with 3 Dolby settings.I thought that being made by RCA it would last. The only problem I had was it died with less than 3 months of use. I had 5 days left of the 90 day limit for returns when it died and I had to return it to WalMart. If this thing had lasted longer I would have given it at least a 4 star rating.Also this model that is listed does NOT come with a 5-Disc DVD/CD player. Just the receiver/amplifier to hook your DVD or VCR up to."
4,Good For the Money,You will not be able to find a better system for the price it has its cons (mainly weak imputs) but on the up side the sysem really kicks when playing call of duty 4 or if you hook ur ipod up to it. i also have my macbook hooked up to it and it sounds great. it also dosent have a dvd player as they say but thats not a big deal for me. over all it is a solid buy you will not be able to get anything better for the price!!!
1,rca rt2770,"I brought this system 12/11/2007, I would let you know this system is no good, I would tell anybody not to buy this system, I have sold this system all ready. This Best System is RCA RT2500 But You Can't find it no more."
2,Too many!,"Options that is...There are so many inputs, digital, analog... I have a feeling I am having an issue because I don't have the inputs right. Maybe. I can't turn the unit up past 10 (about 1/6th of the volume) because the unit powers off by itself and won't turn back on (and stay) unless I turn off all the sound inputs (DVR in this case) then turn the RCA back on and turn on the DVR (or whatever source). I've tried everything. Why don't they make that protection circuit adjustable? Or just take it out and make the unit so a protection circuit isn't needed? Maybe I'll have to go to the 3.1 surround option but I don't really want to! I've got an email in to RCA to see if they can help me but until I update this I suggest you pay a little more and get a Sony (my Sony was awesome (although it's protect circuit gave me trouble at first too)). If I figure this out I'll update this posting."
4,BEATS MY JUNKIE LGLHB335,"WOW MY LG GHB335 DIED AFTER ONE DAY SO I BOUGHT THIS UNIT AND AN AWESUM SAMSUNG BLU RAY NET READY PLAYER WOW, THE SOUND IS INCREDIBLE, THE BASS IS 3 TIMES WHAT THAT JUNK LG COULD DO AND SOUND IS FULL AND CLEAR NO IT'S NO MEGA LOUD BUT IT'S PLENTY LOUD, I DO PRO AUDIO FOR A LIVING AND FOR 151 DOLLARS AT TARGET AM THRILLED!! QUALITY AND EASY TO UNDERSTAND, AGAIN LOOK AT THE PRICE CAN'T BELIEVE THE BASS THAT REAL REMEMBER FOLKS TO SET YOUR DISTANCES AND VOLUMES FOR EACH SPEAKER!! I RECOMMEND THE DOLBY MOVIE THEATER MODE LOUDEST, AND CLEAREST AND IF YOU LOVE BASS LIKE ME RUN ""STRONG BASS MODE"" LOVIN' IT NOW LETS SEE IF IT LAST, LJ HAS TONS OF MY OLD MODEL REFURB ON THE NET I SEE WHY THE SOUND WAS AWEFUL!!"
4,not bad,"I've only had the system for two days, but it sounds ok and is working fine. The inputs are a little weak... but it works for my limited use."
2,Droning interviews spoil this DVD,"A disappointment. I was hoping for extended selections of the artists' music, with maybe a little introduction/explanation. Unfortunately, its mostly artist interviews droning on and on with only snippets of the music. The artist comments are typically, ""...its like everything that's noise can be music...but its like, uh, all about the technology..."" No real passion or insight until some more snippets of a rave flash briefly by. Lots of subtypes of the techno music described, but its confusing how they differ for the lack of lengthy defining examples. If you are a knowledgeable fan and want some camera shots and comments of your heroes, this may be for you. If you want a clear introduction of the music and which artists may interest you enough to buy their music, skip it."
4,Somewhat of a history of electronica...,"Including some of the original classic techno and house trend setters with interview clips of the artists who created them. Interviews with electronic music pioneers such as Carl Cox, Juan Atkins, Robert Moog, Derrick May, and many many more. The first half hour is great but kinda stumbles as it spends too much time reviewing rave music, but then gets back on track. The only extras on the DVD are the trailer and Japanese sub titles."
2,The title of this movie should've been,"""Clubs and Raves and The Young People Who Go To Them--Oh Yeah And The Old Genius Farts That Pioneered The Music They Dance To"". BUY - MY - COPY - PLEASE!!!! I expected this film to play like a Keyboard Magazine interview with the artists; detailing their influences, their gear and how they create their sounds. There's a lot of DJs standing behind turntables bobbing their heads, mere snippets of the new techno bands like Prodigy, only a passing mention of Kraftwerk and no mention at all of the Art of Noise. I was disappointed. If you want the real story of Techno check out History of Rock and Roll: Episode 10 - The Perfect Beat call me: therealpeperl@yahoo.com"
5,A MUST FOR ALL ELECTRONIC MUSIC FANS,This video isn't perfect but it's the best so far in covering the entire spectrum of electronic dance music. It goes so far as to actually showing the Roland keyboard factory! There's multiple interviews with legendary pioneers from decades ago along with today's new artists. There's coverage of Love Parade in Berlin and various other raves. Just about every style of dance music is represented. Drum and Bass and House probably got the most attention. It breaks down to the smallest components of electronic music and how artists get and arrange samples. It's a great introduction to electronic music for those who don't quite understand it yet and a great history lesson to those of use who already love it.
5,An ultra-condensed history of electronic music,"""Modulations"" is a very fast-paced documentary about the past, present, and future of electronic music. Because it is so condensed, lacks narrative voice-over, and features so many people, you'll be able to watch this one again and again and always discover something new.Please do look past the very cheesy cover--it doesn't do justice to what's on the DVD. While rave and commerical acts like Fatboy Slim do get covered, you'll also find great footage of Pierre Henry, Genesis P. Orridge, and Giorgio Moroder (how often do you get to put those three names in a single sentence?)."
5,Modulations: A Brief History,"I am a big fan of this movie. Many reviewers are knocking the Dj's and people in the film, 'for trying to be philisophical'. If you are a fan of Electronic Music, and know that it is not all TECHNO, then you will enjoy this film. It is a nice way of helping people to understand where this form of music comes from.For me it was nice to see the origins of some type of music, because while I am not a fan of Techno, I am a fan of Breakbeat and House Music. I do like Drum and Bass, but I am not a fan of 'Drill and Bass"" or Hard House. It's all preferences.Anyway, I believe that owning this movie is like owning an abbreviated encyclopedia of Electronic Music. It's a necessary addition to your electronic music collection. If you have any music intrest.. it will help you to appreciate this form of it, that much more."
3,This album is off the hook.,The Brown Area is a tight cd that represents NORTE CALIFAS to the fullest. You must buy this cd because it is the bomb.
4,1940s Black Americana,"An interesting book, but sad to think that this portrayal of three young girls and their racially stereotyped parents, Pappy Israel and Mammy Lou (complete with Aunt Jemima head scarf, apron and big bust), was one of the few children's books published in 1940s America depicting African-Americans. Lots of uneducated and overly rusticated dialogue, although the story itself is sweet. The three sisters covet parasols and help with family chores to earn them over the course of many weeks. Lovely, if exaggerated and stereotyped, illustrations by Ninon MacKnight."
5,European Style Black Licorice,"Very good product. It has a nice texture,not waxy tasting like so many other licorice products nowadays. The licorice flavor is accentuated by the texture."
5,Wonderful Movie!,"I'm not normally a fan of such heart-rending movies. However, this movie came highly recommended to me, so I gave it a shot. WOW, am I glad I did! This was one of the best movies I have ever seen, and I don't say that lightly. Be ready to cry, even hardened cynics like myself, will be gushing like a little girl before this hear felt film is finished."
5,A Must Read For All Parents (and Pastors!),"Being a parent is fun, hard work, wonderful, a big responsibility and many more things! It is the most important job given to a person, and yet the most colossally unprepared for. My mom gave me a book by Andrew Murray called ""Raising Your Children For Christ"", which has become the hardest book for me to read. Why? He lands the TRUTH ...like well driven nails and it's hard! Though I wish that I could meet him, I would also be quite scared to. (Think ""Peter"", when Jesus turned to him and said, ""Get behind me Satan, for you are not mindful of the things of God."" And, aren't we looking forward to meeting Jesus one day?) This book has thusfar well served, more than adequately, to point out to me my selfishness and laziness as a parent and a person - and yet somehow inspires me tremendously (I think that's what TRUTH is intended to do)! Great read! I highly recommend it to all parents (and pastors)!"
5,Best Parenting Book I've Read,"I've read a number of parenting books, and there are many good ones, but in my opinion, this is probably the best I've read. It's as helpful to a seasoned parent (myself) as it would be to a new parent. Murray gets right to the root of what we need to know--taken from God's Word itself, which makes the message compelling! It would be a great book for a husband and wife to read a chapter each day, as a devotional together. There are even prayers at the end of the chapters which sum up the thoughts from the chapters. This book does more than lay the foundation of why you need to parent for the Lord, it encourages godly habits, self-control, and other traits that are crucial for seeing your children turn out! He also emphasizes the need to truly be trusting the LORD for the miracle of grace in your children's hearts!! Essential!"
2,A disappointing book,"This is the last book I intend to read about Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis.I am thoroughly disgusted with the tales of her poor little rich girl story. Her parents divorced, her first husband cheated on her, her second husband did also. Who cares about who she supposedly had affairs with?She never had enough money to make up for not having enough love. So this is somehow unique? Somehow I can't feel sorry for her.The rest of us manage to muddle along with what life throws our way. We don't make such a production of it."
5,Jackie After Jack: Book Review,"This is a very good book, the author seems to bring Jackie O to life right before you. You see all sides of the most famous First Lady in America's history. You see the person behind the famous smile and sunglasses, her grief and depression after JFK's murder, her restless traveling and fascinating and ultimately unsatisfactory marriage to Ari Onassis, her rediscovering herself after Ari's death and her final years with the true love of her life, Maurice Templesman. The author makes you realize that this was a real life person, not some Goddess from Mt. Olympus. She was a flawed human being, but then again, aren't we all? I highly recommend to anyone who wants to learn about this fascinating lady."
4,I now understand the previous generation's Kennedy fixation,"This book is a page turner from the beginning. I have never read Christopher Andersen before, and now am reading another novel of his, ""An Affair to Remember"" detailing the love story between Katherine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy. As someone who was not alive when JFK was shot, I never really understood this country's fascination with the Kennedy family. After reading this book, I now have a hunger to learn more about our ""royal family."" This is an easy, entertaining, poignant read."
5,best book this year!,The characters were so realistic I felt like I knew them. I laughed and cried right along with them. It made me think a lot about people and relationships. I strongly recommend this book!
2,where do I start?,"There is a reason the cliche is so popular. Obviously, a lot of women can relate to the ""middle aged women getting stronger through a crisis"" sort of thing.But this book was just so bad! Really poorly written, full of stereotypes, and so predictable. It read as though she were already planning the made for tv movie on the Lifetime channel. Just overly sappy, overly melodramatic. And why is it that in all these books, the women are of a certain sort of financial background? Do you want a real crisis? Try getting cancer and not being a successful attorney. Or cancer without even having insurance. Try leaving your husband and not being super wealthy. It's easy to have tidy endings when the characters don't face realistic problems."
4,A book club that binds 5 women together despite their differences,"This book surrounds the lives of five friends who live in the Chicago area and have a monthly book club. The novel opens with the death of Eve's husband and the turmoil this throws into her life. Her friends attempt to rally around her and her children, but have their own strife. Annie is struggling to have a baby, Gabriella is working extra shifts to support her family after her husband loses his job, Midge, an artist is dealing with her mother moving back to Chicago and in with her, and Doris is trying to deal with her feelings of inadequacy and possible infidelity of her husband. We get to see Eve start to build a new life and possibly find a new love as she goes through the challenges of going back to work. Annie's frustrations with not having a baby threaten to break up her marriage and possibly that of another member. In the end, there are big changes for the group, but they manage to grow the cohesion between them."
5,Monroe's done it again,"Monroe's consistantly heartfelt stories keep me coming back for more. I can relate specifically to the character Eve as I have also lost a significant person in my life. I could identify with her and through her strength, could find my own. Monroe excels at developing realistic characters who deal with the everyday hardships we can all identify with. I always pick up one of her novels whenever I need my spirits raised. She's motivated me time and time again and can't wait to get started on her new book Skyward."
5,An engaging story of women's lives today.,I love reading Mary Alice Monroe's books and this one delivers!Deals with real struggles of believable women and I can identify with many of these issues as a woman of a similar age.These issues we can all see happening in our lives and those of our friends.The only thing I don't know about is some of the lollies (candy) mentioned as we don't have these in Australia!
3,such a common title!,i did not enjoy this book as much as her earlier writings. The Beach House intrigued me with its account of Turtles and their hatchlings. The story line went on too long and if found myself scanning to get to the end.
3,a good read,"I liked this book but I found Midge's story to be uninteresting. Whatever happened between her & Susan? Gabriela didn't have much of a story, so it was hard to develop an opinion of her. There were many times when I doubted the ""friendships"" of these women. I think they cling more to one another out of loneliness/need, not necessarily out of affection or caring. When Doris finally told her husband off, I was disappointed in her method, because it was too quiet. However, I was glad that she finally got her revenge."
1,I'd give No Stars if it was possible,"As other reviewers have said, this book is full of cliches and stereotypes.The childless woman who one day SUDDENLY wakes up and wants kids? Ugh. How tired is that? And, naturally, she has to be ""punished"" for not reproducing by getting cancer. Surprise! The woman whose husband dies and meets the man of her dreams? If your reading taste is at or below Harlequin romances, you'll LOVE this book. Otherwise, stay away."
2,Too many characters,The Book Club had too many characters and didn't stop to identify with all of them. I felt that the characters fell flat and I didn't learn to identify with any of them or really care about what happened to them. I was really hoping to enjoy this book.
2,"Could Have Been a Good Book, But Missed.","Reviewer: Renee S. N.Y.C.This could have been a good book, if Monroe had taken more time to develop the characters and eliminate the cliches. Instead she settled for the easy way out, giving each woman an easily identifiable ""problem"" that could all be tied up by book's end. That was especially true for Midge and Gabriella, whom we hardly got to know as people - just stereotypes. I wanted to know not only what they thought but how they thought. I had hoped, as another reviewer mentioned, that I would be able to do that through their insights on the books they read, but the books themselves, and the book club meetings about them were given short shrift. We were left with a mostly soapy story, with only a few flashes of what could have been. Too bad - and very unsatisfying."
4,"Wonderfully written book of women & friendships, and life!","I found this book by accident, the only one there. Belonging to a ""book club"" as well,I thought this would be an interesting read. Yes it certainly was. All other books had been put aside while I met each character with their most personal thoughts, problems of life and how they emerged upon handling them and how their love of each other deepened. I hated to leave them behind, however they will remain with me for a long while, especially Doris, her strength a marvel to them all. Go Girl! The Epilogue summed up my feeling quite well about this book and life in general, and yes life is grand!"
4,Good Read,"I enjoyed this book, but I do have to qualify that with the statement that this author definitely got better the longer she worked her craft. There are at least three other books that kept me thoroughly enthralled from start to finish. Perhaps because the characters remained the same. I knew them better. I would have liked to have known some of these minor characters better. But I would recommend this to anyone who loves women and how their friendships develop."
4,The book club,It is a real girlie book ....and one where I could relate to the characters from people and friends in my own entourage......worth a read.
3,Feel the Burn,"Quick shipping. This is a great workout, if you want to feel the burn. Not really any new moves, just repetition of the moves you are already familiar with."
3,You feel the burn but video quality not what expected,"In this video you do feel the burn in your legs and glutes. However, the setting is him and what appears to be a random girl in an empty hall. The camera man is all over the place.The main excersice is not good if done on a carpet and is quite difficult if you don't have good balance. Worth maybe a few bucks, but not more than $8 in my opinion"
1,Disappointing to say the least,"This DVD came in the a cardboard sleeve. No DVD case, which is very cheap. The workout was basically two exercises, squats and lunges with some variations. I was hoping for more variety. The camera left the girl working out to focus on the ""host"" and it was impossible to keep up. The camera needs to stay focused on the exercise, not him. Definitely not worth the price and for me, a complete waste of money."
1,stupid. waste of money,"All this video is, is a 20 min side lunge routine. So, if u want different routines, u gotta buy all yhe dvds. Thats how they get ya.. not worth the money.. really? 20 min of doin the same thing... Left leg, them right leg side lunges. Blahh"
2,Not worth the money,"The DVD was not what I expected at all. It's about 20 min of 4 different moves, left side then right side. A lot of pressure on knees and feet. The ""secret"" is the use of a towel on a hard floor, sliding it back and forth while doing different moves. Not worth buying just the one CD. Should've got the whole package or something else."
1,Not happy,"When I received this DVD in the mail, I was excited ... Then I saw ""Free extra"" on the cover. This tells me that I paid 25.00 for a DVD that was a free addition to the expensive REAL DVD.So, I paid 25.00 for a DVD that would have been FREE, if I had purchased the entire Brazil Butt Lift DVD.Not too happy.."
1,A total ripoff,"This is not a 20 minute toning workout, this is an advertising and promotional video to try to get you to buy the full workout set. There is maybe two minutes of actual exercises. Misleading and a waste of money."
2,Too many repetitive moves,"I was excited to try this DVD, but I was disappointed when I attempted to perform the moves. First, the moves he has you do on one leg/side are too many for as long as he has you doing them. I think the model who was in the video was even having a hard time with them. It would have been better to maybe perform 3-4 moves on one leg and then switch to the other leg. Sure, doing a ton on one leg at one time might get quicker results but it's very strenuous even for someone who is fit.Also, there wasn't much variety in the types of moves he showed. I would recommend doing these moves to your own rep/set preferences as they seem to be helpful in getting results, but will also make you not want to do the video out of dread of boredom with the same moves over and over again."
5,Great workoput for only 20 minutes,"OMG my legs were killing me (in a good way) each time after I used this DVD. I stopped using it because I dont stick to at home exercise regimens very long (I love the gym too much). But I would definitely recommend this for anyone who's a beginner and wants to exercise in the comfort of their own home. A hard, but effective workout that keeps your heart rate up."
5,5 STARS,"I first heard Sea Foam (track 2) on [...] and fell in love. I wasn't disappointed when I listened to the entire cd when I got it in the mail. If I had to compare it to someone else, I'd mix Garbage's 'Milk' with Yeah Yeah Yeah's 'Rich'. Probably not a good reference but the cd is good from start to finish and sure to please."
1,Not Happy,I bought this book because I am a Sal Mineo fan. I read other negative reviews about this book but I bought it anyway because I wanted to read about him and hoped I might enjoy it anyway. Hopefully a well written book will be published about Sal Mineo but this is not it. There was no insight at all on Sal Mineo and the type of person he was. The author just seemed to have read some old magazine interviews and watched Sal's films and wrote his book based on that.
1,Not the best biography out there,Many of the reviews here were written before the 2011 published new biography by Michael Michaud. I strongly recommend that anyone wanting to read a biography on Sal Mineo read the newer biography as it is far superior to this book. It actually has detailed interviews with Sal's partners unlike this one and seems much more accurate.
2,below average.,"I've waited a long time to see a book written about the wonderful,Sal Mineo. Now,an author with respectable credits,has written this sloppy,one dimensional view,of an actor that deserves much more! Some of the book is interesting,but always goes back to Sal's homosexuality,and the fact the author had a few one night stands with him.And the way the author exploits Sal's sex life,it seems that wasn't a big accomplishment. I don't think Sal Mineo was properly depicted in this book,as the author obviously has some obession with the fact he had sex with him.I hope a more respectful author will come along,and not try to exploit Sal's sex life,for the sake of selling-out."
1,Dismal Clip Job,"Sal Mineo and those interested in his life and career deserve better than this tawdry clip job. There is no evidence that the author conducted any interviews with friends, family or colleagues of Mineo. He plays up Mineo's gay sexuality till it becomes tiresome. The A&E Biography is much better, as is E!'s episode of Mysteries and Scandals devoted to Mineo."
2,Not the best World's Finest book I've ever read.,"First let me say that this is not a standalone book. If you don't know the history of Batman and Superman there will be places where you'll stop and go ""huh?"" I felt Mr. Kessel could have done a much better job referencing this history rather than just expecting the reader to know it. That said, I thought the book started off very well. The first four years (the book covers a ten year period) was well written and very enjoyable. The fifth year, which dealt with Mxyzptlk and Bat-Mite, was fun. Unfortunatly, the book goes down hill from there. I found the ending to be silly and completely unsatisfying. Which pretty well sums up the last half of the book."

3,nice,"lol i bought this a few years ago but never reviewed it... it was a fun toy.. thats all it was, i got tired of it within a year.. oh well."
3,Fun piece of gear... but I do wish for improvements...,"It looks jazzy, the packaging sure makes it look very cool, the manual is very well written, it's virtually idiot-proof and will yield immediate ""results"". I am emphasizing the ""results"" because in this aspect I wish MadWaves would allow for more tweakability. I hope that - given that the configuration menu apparently is still at it's infant stages - more updates will be made available from their site. At this stage, though I don't see how the ""raw"" output (i.e. unprocessed) can really beat the more pro sounding stuff that can be done with a groovebox or a digital audio workstation. I am currently sampling the drum and bass tracks in audio format and then I tweak the results with my sampler + various effects ina quick and efficient manner. Fun."
3,description not correct,The flashlight is not the flashlight they described in Amazon.com. They showed it too be a 7 3/4 inche flashlight when it was a 4 inches. It was just a little small.
5,amazing,"These things are the greatest thing since sliced bread. They're compact and amazingly bright. Since they use LEDs insteead of a bulb, you get a lot more light with a lot less battery."
5,The best flashlight I have ever owned,"Like many men, I consider myself a flashlight connoisseur. I've owned Garritys, Maglites, Evereadys, Photons, and Dorcys and have never been more impressed with my little Garrity 9 LED. I now own three, but I bought my first one on a trip to the beach this summer (2007). It was hands-down the brightest flashlight on the beach. At home I use my flashlights for everything--working in the crawlspace and the attic, late night trips to the mailbox, and miscellaneous home-improvement and home-emergency tasks. My only warning is to be aware of incorrect battery insertion instructions on the little cartridge (remember that the negative battery terminal compresses the spring not the positive terminal). I've found all three of my Garrity 9 LEDs at Wal-Mart for around $5. Also, this flashlight will not eat up your batteries. I'm still going strong on my original flashlight and original batteries."
1,Dangerous firestarter!,"This item is dangerous. I got it, put the batteries in as instructed, and the light would not work. Double checked arrangement of the supplied duracells. Still wouldn't work. Left it on my bathroom vanity. Came back in 10 minutes and it was extremely hot to the touch near the switch with a smell of burning plastic. Took it apart and removed the batteries to find it was melting inside. Returning and won't buy another. I'll stick with the disposable lifelight, never had a problem with those. BUYER BEWARE!"
1,led mini flashlight review,The ring that secured the metal strap that makes contact with the battery group fell out of the flashlight immediately upon opening. I could not put the ring back in the unit. The battery group would not go back in the flashlight without bending the metal contact strip. In flustration I put the flashlight in the garbage.
4,The little light that could.,"A nice ""small"" sturdy flashlight for the glove-box or night stand. I have three of these myself, and gave several away as gifts and stocking stuffers. A great ""emergency light"" you can carry in your pocket.I did incurr a problem in two flashlights with the battery holder as the contacts could be better designed as in my other LED flashlights.The light is bright with the 9 LED's, and the switch (button on end) is strong and does not easily turn on by itself so the batteries will not be run down when you need light."
3,Save your money,"I have own a burly, a swinn, and the instep trailers.First off I have we bike at 3 to 8 miles daily, so the trailer is used alot. And is put into some pretty extreme conditions, such as logging library books, grocercies, going down some 90 inclines a 35 pound two year, overweight fox terrier and dealing with constant battering.First off Schwinn and the instep are made by PAcific Cycle. Same company, different trailers. I would choose the cheaper Instep over the Scwinn. The Schwinn as roll bars, is about 10 pound heavier then the instep which adds pulling weight. And the dang thing is just aclumsy and bouncy. The Schwinn has already had a small hole torn in the top fabric even though we have it less then a month. The Schwinn does have better shoulder straps, and cup holders. Otherwise the instep in a far better price and purchase if you are not wanting to spend 350 to 450 for a burley"
3,slow,"The Great World engaged me in the beginning and through the war, then seemed to drag on to a slow, boring end. Perhaps that's the point of the book, how war dries up life from life in those who survive it."
3,"Excellent Imagery of the Australian ""Digger""","Just finished this book, and found it slow going but had a fantastic sense of imagery. The characters are very fully developed .. one really gets to know them before they are taken away one by one."
1,Poor Quaility (9/26/06 Update: Excellent Quaility!!!!),"If this release is any thing like the set in the Ultimate colection, save your money. Only a few of the episodes looked to be remastered and cleaned. The others were dirty and would loose focus at tmes. One episode kept going in and out of focus all through the episode. Don't buy the set unless Fox releases a better quaility remastered set.***UPDATE***Hey All, These ARE NOT the same release as in the Ultimate set. These have been remastered and cleaned. The quaility on this release of the cartoon series is the best I have ever seen. I rate this set 5 large stars!!!"
2,For Completists Only,"I bought this two years ago, and so far have only watched three episodes. Despite the potential for some good stories, the show doesn't really hold my interest. The abysmal quality of mid-70s TV animation doesn't help, as everything is very stiff and static, and certain shots are repeated again and again.The cost of animation was skyrocketing in the 1970s, and with a limited budget there was not much the producers could do. When computers began to take over in the late 80s, animation could once again delight and amaze, but this only emphasizes the stodgy quality of 70s cartoons.The live action series was much more interesting and enjoyable. As a POTA enthusiast, I suppose I should give the cartoon another try, but it's just not compelling viewing. I'd recommend this only for hard-core fans of the films."
3,"Release date changed to October 3, 2006","Several other sites on the net now give this DVD set a release date of October 3, 2006."
1,Return to the Planet of the Apes,"The animated Saturday Morning Show still is worth watching. The 13 episodes of stories are gear for both kids and adults a like. It has thesame basic story line as the movies, but starts at the begining with three new astronauts. The color is excellent."
1,Return to the Planet of the Apes,JUST ABOUT AS HOKKIE AS THEY COME- ANIMATION? IS VERY POOR - I KNOW ITS OLD BUT ???
4,Planet of the Apes cartoon,"This is a great relic of the early 1970's, it gets panned for it's basic animation style, very much like the early animated Star Trek cartoon of similar time period. For the Planet of the Apes completist you must have this as it is a "" Apes"" and cartoon collectors gem, for the curious it is a great example of early 1970's cartoon sci-fi, and for the high octane ADHD X-Box generation who expect to view everything like film never existed and all must be HD Blue-Ray to be watchable then the eclectic value here might escape them."
4,Good way to monkey around.,"This was one of my favorites when I was a kid. In retrospect there are a couple of things that kind of detract from the show. The way the apes referred to the people as humanoids instead of humans like in the movies was one. The only other complaint is that the animation was a little slow. However, the art, especially the backgrounds, were fantastic. The stories were very good as well. I think that the music was underrated as well. It was very effective in establishing an eerie mood to the show. I wish that this show would have at least made it to a second season. I would have liked to see where the writers were going. Its a shame that cartoons weren't as well regarded as they are today. I would have also like to have seen special features with this DVD."
5,General Urko has a driver's licence!,"Doug Wildey, creator of Hanna Barberra's JONY QUEST, returns to animated series television with this undiscovered jewel! His take on POTA has the simians driving cars (instead of riding horseback like in the films)flying airplanes,and broadcasting tv! All your favorite characters are back, rendered in the distinctive Wildley style, in stories that take the themes from the films and develope them into kid-friendly Saturday morning fare that is just as entertaining for the grown-ups. A must have for all POTA FANS!"
4,took a punt & it plays,my son hasn't watched it yet but I did check if it plays as we are not in region 1 and yay I can play it on our dvd that is only supposed to play region 4 so am very happy. i'm sure my son will enjoy it as he & I are planet of the apes fans
4,Fun!!,"Ok the quality of the animation leaves a lot be desired, but the story is really enjoyable. Have just watched the 13 episodes over two days and want more!!Haven't seen the remastered episodes as I watched the ones in the `Ultimate' box-set.Highly recommended if you've seen the films and the live action tv series."
3,poems by a storywriter,i cant say that i loved the work. i sometimes feel its hard for a story writer to cross over and write poetry. that came across here as well--in my opinion. i struggled thru most of the work
5,"Enjoyable, bright, sunny-morning-at-the-cafe selections","I like this CD so much, I'm buying it again so I can have a second copy for home. I'm a high school science teacher and I wanted an unobtrusive, but not bland, collection of Mozart to play in the background as my students worked. I found that this CD more than satisfied my meager demands by being invigorating without being overpowering, and varied enough so as to not get stale, even when on continuous play. My students have enjoyed it as well, quickly becoming comfortable with what, for most of them, was a new type of music, even asking me to play it if I forget to cue it up before class. I can't comment on the technical virtuosity of the performances, but they are certainly adequate, and the quality of the recording is very good. The music is presented in a menu style, with 'appetizers', 'main course', and 'dessert'. All in all, just the music for times when you need a pleasant, easily palatable, uplift for your day."
3,Could be better,"I have been using this book for a few months now. It is good BUT when I have a question, I often can't find the answer. The little quirks that happen in a business (getting refunds from supplies) etc, aren't answered. All in all, it's good to set up with."
3,"""We burn them to ashes, and then we burn the ashes.""","Intersting but not as informative as ""Burning Man, The Black Rock Desert..."" . Needs to be more of a docu on just one year's festival. The history has already been told...but I'll watch it again anyway."
3,Good but unexpected,"It was a pretty interesting and informative book. However, in regards to content, the book was primarily about how Burning Man came to be, the people who started it all and contributed to it's ongoing creation rather than being about the event itself. It has alot to do with how the city functions, who makes it function and why. Very good book though if you're looking for the why and the how to the question of Burning Man."
4,The best available for non-vets!,"This book has a wealth of information useful to the guinea pig owner that you won't find in books from the pet stores. It has served as a health guide to me, as well as to my friends who also own piggies, for over 5 years. It is especially useful if vets in your area are ignorant on the subject of guinea pig health care (which is more often the case than you'd care to know). At the very least, it serves as a starting point for further investigation into health problems when you don't know where to turn. I highly recommend it to anybody who really loves their guinea pigs and wants to look out for them."
3,Outdated...,Out of date electronics is the only problem with this item...Get a more advanced model if you want an electronic Bible...
5,"Better Reading, Better Understanding",The electronic New International Version Bible is wonderful. It's easy to read and understand and very convenient to carry around everywhere I go.
1,Very Satisfied,"I was visiting my sister-in-law, who had purchased from Amazon.com theFranklin Electronic Bible. I liked it so much, I ordered 3 for me andmy children (all adults). They arrived before the alloted time for delivery and are now being used daily. Thank you for your prompt andeasy service."
4,franklin pocket bible,"I have enjoyed this pocket bible very much. I can find scripture passages rapidly. I will use this bible in my bible classes. Thanks, zls"
4,In case you are unaware...,"The performance of the B-minor Mass in this set is NOT the famous one in the boxed set of LPs, contrary to what other reviewers have implied. Sorry, but it is not as good, plus it was recorded in front of a live audience, meaning coughs etc. Why would DGG do this? I feel duped."
3,Recording of a 1958 performance,"These CDs (there are 10 of them) are from Summer 1958 performances. The sound quality is, therefore, not what we are used to in high quality recordings. The label is not really the Deutsche Grammophon we are used to, but one of their ""Archiv Produktion"". It isn't really possible to see this in the CD cover because you can't blow it up online. The performance is very good, I just wish the sound were what I was expecting in choosing Deutsche Grammophon."
1,Vinegar?,"I got so fed up with the sprayer clogging I finally called the Zilla company. I must say I got a response but not my exact plan to be soaking these things in vinegar to make them work, most especially the calcium supplement. I will search for an alternative as my nerves are shot in dealing with this horrible task of the clogging sprayer. Poor design and short sightedness."
3,Indian Uprising Geronimo on the Warpath Again!,This video is an old classic with George Montgomery and Miguel Inclan as Geronimo redone in 1979 but was original in 1958. This Black & White is pretty accurate from Army Archives. Geronimo is urged to sign a treaty which guarantees that indian territory will be kept free from White mercenaries. 1885 Captain McCloud risks court-martial when he gets stuck in between and eventually convinces Geronimo to surrender.
5,Extreamly Funny,This book kicks I have never read a book so funny next to RED DWARF Better Then Life Those two books are the in Science fiction novels I hope I can get a hold of some more RED DWARF books.
4,pretty good,"this book was a pretty quick read. it relies pretty heavily on season 1 of red dwarf, with many bits being exactly the same word for word as they were on the show. so if you've seen the first season of the show, you've pretty much read this book. unfortunately, all the red dwarf books have a tendency to rely on things we've already seen on the show. i've read all the red dwarf books, and the only one that's not really guilty of doing this is 'last human,' which i feel is probably the weakest of all the red dwarf novels.on the other hand, there are some differences in the way these events occurred that are interesting. and it's also interesting to see inside the character's minds in a way that you can't by watching the show. i give this book four stars because i am a big fan of red dwarf and the jokes still hold up whether on the tv set or written on a page."
3,Quite a fun book!,"The synopsis compares this book to Douglas Adams, which isn't quite fair--this can never measure up to that standard. But it is nevertheless a delightfully quirky sci-fi novel that was better than I expected....."
4,Great fun in an easy read.,"While not as magnificent as the series it's often compared to (The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy), this is a creative and very funny Brit-humor sci-fi adventure that is sure to please anyone with minimal interest in sci-fi and/or a wry sense of humor."
4,I loved it with one small problem.,"The book was fabulous and I loved the way they talked about the Cat civilization, they ought to write more on that, but I didn't like the last section ""Earth"". Maybe I'm just weak but I don't like doubting my own exsistence. If I don't read the sequal soon I may have nightmares intil I see how their, Better than life, game ends. But please don't let that keep you from reading that,just have the second book on hand. That was the low point, but it did have some really great details on how Lister came to be on the Red Dwarf. Eli@"
5,Worth all the funny looks I got reading it on the train.,Quite simply the funniest smegging book I have ever read. I dare anyone to think differently.
3,It was an OK read,Bought the book for my husband and he and I both give it 3 stars. Book was an ok read but not good for use in referencing any sort of material. Content was highly speculative and not as in-depth as we had expected.
1,Not my cup of tea.,"My hubby likes this one okay but I wouldn't watch it again. The story line wasn't quite what I had in mind but to each his own. I've seen much better holiday movies but unfortunately this wasn't one of them but I hate the movie ""The Christmas Story"" about the leg lamp, etc... so this one fits in with that one. The sellar was great, movie got here in good time & plays ok so all okay on that. Thank you.Sincerely, RL"
3,Funny but a little slow / cheesy,"Was looking for something different than the usual Christmas movies and tried this one out. It's funny, but a little slow and cheesy."
2,Havent we seen this before,"Surviving Christmas has all the elements of a Christmas movie, and still isnt fun. It follows the fomula to the point, making it really predicable. It could've been a cute movie, if I didnt figure out the ending in the first five minutes."
2,Not good.,"This movie has been widely reviled and rightly so. It's not an easily watched Christmas movie. Or even an easily watched movie. It's crass, demeaning and a little icky. You can only make jokes about what a teenage boy does in his room with a computer so many times. The love interest subplot between Affleck and Christina Applegate changes from ""You're despicable, get out of my family home"" to ""Maybe we should make out."" too quickly. Affleck goes from miserable selfish jerk to nice guy too quickly. Did I mention the ick factor?But if you hate Christmas and you love (and can easily forgive) Ben Affleck, this is your movie."
1,"Could have been an excellent movie, but...","I was highly disappointed in this movie. The storyline itself was actually a good one. It had a lot of potential. But it was ruined by vulgarities. Definitely not what I would consider an ""uplifting family Christmas movie"" which is the kind of movie I'm looking for at Christmas time."
1,Just Awful,"I waited and waited for it to get better, but it only got worse. So much talent was wasted on this."
4,Reviewer: Big Zach! NOT A KIDS REVIEW! although a kid!,This is a great movie I have no idea why it was a flop. It is a very enjoyable comedy. That will really get you into the christmas spirit. It is one of my all time favorite christmas movies. The stars in it were great also. Ben Affleck was hilarious! He was perfect for the role it really brings a different side to him and shows that he can also be funny besides doing movies like Pearl Harbor and Daredevil.Christina Applegate(super Hot!) was also very good in this movie shes come a long way from Married with children.Catherine O Hara(super Hot!) was also very good and very funny.There was other great stars but I just dont feel like talkin about them.
4,SURVIVING CHRISTMAS isn't such a chore after all!,"When you release a Christmas movie a week before Halloween, I would think a red flag would have to go up. Is it THAT bad that you have to avoid putting it up against other holiday films? That's what I thought, and that's where I was wrong. The film stars Ben Affleck as a lonely man on Christmas who rents a family for $250,000. The film is funny, bittersweet, and had the audience laughing out loud on several occassions. After you catch your haunted Halloween movies next week, make sure you catch SURVIVING CHRISTMAS before it makes its premature departure. It may not go down as an instant holiday classic, but it will definitely lift your spirits this Christmas season. Besides, it beats staying home and watching another two dozen political ads!"
3,Not as bad as critics say,"Look I know since Gigli peoples faith in Ben Affleck have been shaken,but the truth is,Gigli and Surviving Christmas arent bad at all. They are ninety minutes of funny stuff that help you get your mind off the crap that happens in a day.Just the day I saw Surviving, I was having a lousy week at work.Me and my friend went to see this and we came out laughing,and for just a little while I felt better.If a movie can do that,maybe it isnt half bad.Not every movie needs to be an arthouse masterpiece."
4,Enjoyable comedy,"I'm not a a big fan of Ben Affleck or anything but I thought this was a fun movie with an original story.I have a hard time understanding the really low reviews others have given. Certainly I wouldn't expect it to bring in Oscar nominations but it was enjoyable. I rarely write reviews, but the negative reviews compelled me to add my opinion. This must be one of those love-it-or-hate-it movies because the ranking on Amazon is in line with other places, including IMDB."
3,Had It's moments,"This movie came out at the right time, just in time for the holidays, but it was lacking something that I can't quite put my finger on. It was very funny at times, but I found myself almost forcing laughter at times. It does help you realize what is most important in your life though, your family. I give the movie props for that. The characters were funny, the story was funny, but it wasn't really laugh-out-loud comedy."
2,"Jingle Bells, Jingles Bells...This movie sucks!",I hated this movie! I waited for t to be better but it never came. Do not buy or rent it! The plot is so stupid!!! Rent/Buy the Plague Dogs instead. A much better movie!
1,This film flat out stinks!,"I'm sorry people, but this movie is just so stupid. Even if you believe in pixie fairies and happy marriages, this film is far fetched. Ben Afflack sucks period too. I don't like him, I think he's a talentless loon, much like Nicolas Cage, Tom Cruise, and Will Smith, but what do I know.So anyway Ben is lonely on Christmas (like we care) and he returns to his childhood home. He hires the family living there to be his family. Then he hires an old dude to be his doo-da. Well everything is going along very stupidly with no humor, then the daughter (Cristina Applegate) comes home. Even if you haven't seen this movie (you are blessed) you can see where this goes.This is just an awful movie. I'd rather smell the alcohol and salami breath on a mall Santa all day than be tortured with this garbage. Ben, you stink. Your films stink, and your career is a joke."
1,Your'e Kidding Me!!!,"I cant believe it but did anyone else notice that this movie was only in theatre's for 2 monthes and now it's already on DVD!It really must of sucked! I have not seen it so, I wouldn't know. But the reviews say it sucks really bad!"
4,Surviving Christmas a new tradition,"The video is one I have grown to think of as a tradition in our house for Christmas. If you haven't seen it, then I would recommend that you do."
4,Strange but different,"I am a huge fan of Christmas movies and for some reason, I really like this movie. It's kind of strange and different from the usual Christmas movies but what can I say, I really liked this movie (yes, I'm repeating myself)!"
2,Christmas CD,"This movie is okay. Not one of the best Christmas CD's out there, but it is far from the worst. If you can get it cheap, than it will be worth it. Ben, has certainly done better movies than this one."
1,Bad,"Humor was terrible. I was told it was ""so funny"" but turned it off 30 minutes into the movie. My opinion is, it's a horrible movie!"
2,"Disappointing movie !,",This was not one of my favorite movies. It was not suitable for children. It had some very suggestive scenes in it
3,Surviving Christmas,"It was ok - the ""magic"" of the trailer did not support the movie...The ending was good though. Overall nice Christmas movie."
2,Turned it off after 20 minutes,"I am a fan of all of the leading actors in this movie, including Ben Affleck. I have to say, though, that his acting is simply sub-par in this film. Right from the start the quality of his acting gave the film a ""B"" movie feel. It was just so odd and cliche, and by 20 minutes in I couldn't take it anymore and shut it off."
4,Christmas Movies,Very satisfied with this product and timely receipt of product. Love this story and treasure this movie as it ranks up there with 'A Christmas Story'.
4,Surviving Christmas,"I thought this movie was very light and funny. I thought that Ben Affleck was really funny. I loved James Gandolfini, he was hilarious. I'm not sure why it had really bad reviews. I enjoyed the movie."
5,I Liked This Movie,"I really liked this movie and the main reason for that is that it made me laugh. Here we have a millionaire who has no family and decides that he will 'rent' one for Christmas. The Valcos, who now live in his childhood home are not thrilled, but the idea of the money makes them decide to give it a try.Of course you know the outcome of the movie halfway through, but still there are some really funny scenes and a happy ending.If a movie can make me giggle and let me just relax for a while, I think it's worth my time and I do love a happy ending.Give it a try; you might be glad you did."
1,Appeals to a narrow age-range,"I was hoping for a fun close-up look at animals for my preschooler, maybe with some upbeat music and a few basic animal facts. Instead, this is a MUCH more cranial-oriented production, with many details about a handful of animals, and complete with a ""quiz"" at the end. Great for elementary-age kids who enjoy factoids, or parents who are homeschooling and want to incorporate this into their 3rd or 4th grade science curriculum. Not age-appropriate for a preschooler, though, and probably very boring for anyone over 10!"
5,Funny Money Tips,"Ellie Kay has done it again! In her new book ""How to Save Money Every Day,"" Ellie will have you laughing (literally!) all the way to the bank with the money you'll save following her tips. What makes Ellie's advice so extraordinary is that in many ways it's so...well...ordinary! This is practical stuff anyone can put into practice every day in every area of life. And because ""time is money,"" you'll save a lot of both with Ellie's web tips - she tells you exactly where to go! If you want to live better for less and enjoy it - this book is a must."
1,Ellie Kay,"This book did have a few good ideas but the more I read the more I was put off by her constant plugs for her other book and her website, this occurs on nearly EVERY page. There are also several biblical references, which are fine I guess since that is her audience but will put off the non-Christian reader. ""More with Less"", ""Extending the Table"", ""Tightwad Gazette"" are by far better choices. I checked this out at the library and would suggest you do that before purchasing for yourself."
5,Bargain of a Book!,"Saving money every day--now THERE'S a concept that makes my husbands wallet glow with affection! Whether it's appliances or zinnias you need, Ellie Kay can save you cash. This book is a bargain hunter's dream. Kali Schnieders, Author ""Truffles From Heaven"""
3,"Not bad, better for the novice saver",I really wasn't that impressed. Her ideas are good but there really wasn't anything new that I wasn't aware of. If you are a novice saver than this is for you. It has great ideas for those that don't know where to find coupons or web sites. Her stories were interesting but a little lengthy at times. I just wanted to look over the material!
2,"Much, much, much too slow!","Satie's beautifully melancholic piano music is made sooooo dull by Mr Leeuw's elephantine playing, and this lethargic speed completely ruins my enjoyment of it. There is nothing in the music to warrant such a gross miscalculation of tempo. I'd recommend other recordings of Satie's music which more faithfully adhere to his intentions (Roge etc.)"
3,Lots of silence,"I'm new to Satie and don't have an opinion yet on the artistic interpretation. However, I was a little disappointed at how much silence there was in this album. It feels like the recording level was much too low, and there is between about 5 and 15 seconds of silence at the beginning of each track. If you're looking for a quiet, meditative album to listen to in the background, this would probably fit the bill; but if you want to include this in a playlist with anything else, or want to listen to it in the foreground, the low levels and excessive silence will just make it awkward."
5,The ghost of Satie,Some credit Satie with the invention of Ambient music. After hearig this recording one can hear Saties' true intent. Everyone else rushes through his music as if they just don't get it. Reinbert de Leeuw lets the notes breath into little droplets of emptiness. I have been looking for this C.D for years Thanx Amazon.
3,"Interpretations are sublime, sound quality is not","Mr. de Leeuw's slow, spacious interpretations have caused some controversy. They shouldn't have. Satie practically invented ambient music; these interpretations nail the slow, sensual qualities of Satie's early piano music. They're my first choice among some tough competition.Unfortunately, the sound engineers missed a horrible low frequency rumble that made it onto the final master of this digital recording. If you listen to this disc on a system capable of reproducing low frequency sound, this will be annoying.Fortunately, de Leeuw recorded all of these works, plus many others, on an older analog recording that became a 2 disc set, also for Phillips (http://www.amazon.com/Satie-The-Early-Piano-Works/dp/B0000069CS/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top). Buy that recording instead. There's a small amount of tape hiss, but it's far more tolerable than the strong low bass rumble in this recording."
