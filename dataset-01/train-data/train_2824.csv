1,Scholarly Analysis,"This book is filled with great information but is very poorly written. It is filled with grammatical errors, spelling errors, and poorly structured sentences. Our class enjoys poking fun at it and our teacher plans to write the publishing house in reference to their need for a better editing."
1,Not Very Valuable,The text is not very valuable. It presents the material from a condescending perspective leaving the reader with little to work with. The language is too academic to the point of being incomprehensible. There are plenty of other books which are far more valuable and aimed toward an academic audience.
2,"One of the Most Disturbing ""Kid's"" Books I've Ever Read","I got this book at my local library a little while ago. At first it was a really good book but then I noticed a lot of innapropriate material not suitable for children. There was heavy cursing throughout the book that left me aghast. There was also one part that was EXTREMELY violent that really had me questioning if I had accidentally picked up an Adult/ Teen book.I won't go into it, in case any other kid is reading this article. I highly recommend that if you are 14 or under to not read this book."
1,The Ghose Horse of Meadow Green,"The Ghost Horse of Meadow Green may appeal to the horse-crazy middle school girl who can relate to ""Kim"", the 12-year-old girl who has always dreamed of ""a horse of her own."" But most other readers will find a very disturbing story of a young girl in a highly disfunctional and artificial family. Her parents prefer that she call them by her first name. Her father, the absent-minded college professor, has no tolerance or compassion for his daughter. Her mother, knowing this, leaves Kim alone with her father for three quarters of the book, while she works to bring her beloved mother-in-law ""Grandma-Lou"" home. Miraculously, everyone overcomes their short-comings in the closing chapters of the book. The characters are not believable, and the story line will only flow for the reader who has always dreamed of owning her own horse."
3,Trailer Home,Is a great song! There's always drugs that will save you! What happened to this band? I hope that they aren't dead!
1,Crap,"The song ""Let Me Love You"" is just awful. It's not worth getting if you already have her cd ""Tissues and Issues"" (which has the song ""Call My Name"")."
5,Amazon is selling the Indian edition,"This is a great book and indispensable for the lay and professional practitioner alike. Note that Amazon is selling the Indian edition. The American edition has better binding, clearer print, is not as thick and costs more--a forewarning to those of you who expect the Amer. version, which is most common in health stores. Nonetheless, a great reference."
2,2-day shipping?,"I placed an order for a set of DVD's: Complete seasons 1-4 Ghost Whisperer with this seller and paid for 2-day express shipping. The order was placed on June 20, and when I hadn't received it by June 24, I contacted the seller. When I hadn't received an email response about my order by June 25, I got online to write this poor review for poor customer service and communication. I still have not received my order and it's been 5 days. :("
1,Charles Darwin,"Amazon's corporate christian bias is obvious and reeks of cultism, this Rupert Murdoch {700 club} publications well reception here underscores it. Or should I buy it because Alice Walker is black."
3,"Very nice, but thought was ordering all of them for the price.","Beautifully crafted. The description is misleading. It makes it sound like you are getting all 4 of the plaques when you really only get ONE for $29.99. I was disappointed because I wanted to hang them as a group. I am not willing to pay $29.99 EACH, but thought it was a good deal for all four. Just beware that you only get one and it appears that they randomly choose which one. I got ""good fortune""."
1,Their worst by a kilometer,"Make that a mile.I love this band, have everything by them I've ever been able to get hold of. I tried hard to like this record, but in the end I gave it away to get it out of my house.Possibly the worst record by a major band in 20 years. Wotta dissapointment. Maybe this is a record for people who don't like the Fall.New to the Fall? I would start with ""Hex Enduction Hour"" or ""Perverted by Language"", then try ""Grotesque""(early), ""This Nation's Saving Grace""(produced), ""Kurious Oranj"" (tight), the singles compilations (both are excellent), ""Wonderful and Frightening World of..."" (2x4), etc."
4,It's the last few lines...,"TOS was a great series, granted. It gave us an optimistic prophesy of the future not always present in SciFi. This episode is engaging, if a bit far-fetched scientifically. What would the world be like if the Romans had never been conquered? Alternative history is always fun, but this would have been far more plausible if they had traveled to another dimension rather than another planet within our universe. However, it is sad to watch episode after episode of Trek and discover that one's people simply ceased to exist, or so it seems. Even Worf in TNG can be Jewish, but God forbid that Christians be present. The brief glimpses therefore are all the more dear, as one finds in this episode. It's worth it for the last few lines."
1,Romans in Space?,"I have never liked the Star Trek episodes that deal with Earth parallels. Am I to assume that the whole galaxy is made up of Romans, Gangsters from the 1920s, Nazis, and Yankees and Communists? Give me a break!"
5,"excellent-covers politics, culture and management","International projects are often very political. Culture applies too. There have been few books written about this important area. Being involved in international projects for years i have found many tips in here that are useful. There are checklists, good examples, and guidelines for handling competing demands for the same people, resource allocation, and headquarters-local office conflicts. Valuable for anyone involved in international projects of all types."
2,Please fix me,Well this game didn't fix any problems since NHL99. The goalie GPA is outrageous and the shooting Percentages are unbelievable. This game is a waste of money unless you don't have a NHL game or you just want the new teams. EA sports makes the best hockey game but it has a long way to go. P.S. To EA sports watch some hockey to see how the game is really played thankx.
4,It's Ok but a little far from real hockey,"The game is fun but the scoring is way too high, the graphics are awesome. the hits are cool. When the other team is about to score they hit the puck around so fast you can't even see it, no matter what goalie you got they still get the score up in the 6 or 7s."
1,"Yes, it's that bad","I just got NHL 2001 off ebay. I love all EA Sports games so for me to be writing a review like this, it has to be pretty ugly. Where to begin? First, the play control. The players are impossible to control. Even after you stop, the player seems to continue to slide down he rink. For some reason, players also do 360 spins from one side to side for no apparent reason. Editing lines is also awkward. It's hard to explain, but if the game edits a team for you, you might wind up with a player on more than one line (example: Rob Blake playing left wing and D). If you go to scratch the player from just one line, the game will scratch him from both lines, so it can become tedious to put your player exactly where you want him. Imagine what it feels like to finally set your lines only for your memory card to decide not to save anything... Just stay away from NHL 2001 if you're thinking about getting it."
5,no more slipping,"I replaced the spings (asin:B000WNRSCI) and the springs at the same time. Poking around the clutch was a fun learning experience, but much more importantly, my clutch doesn't slip anymore. I had been missing the ""sweet spot"" in the rev range for a while, and now my bike has its guts back."
2,Well...,"Despite all the praise young Menuhin gets on these recordings, I will save my praise for someone else's greater recordings...George Enescu.These renditions are cold, dry and mechanical when comparing them to his teacher's versions.Menuhin simply doesn't have a clue in the understanding of these pieces. He just plays the notes beautifully, but with no spirit or deep meaning behind them.I'm sorry, but I do really admire Mehuhin..he was one of the most gifted of musicians we have ever had, but these recordings do not do these pieces justice they should. I would rather recommend Menuhin's later Stereo versions on EMI, as they are more profound and at that time Menuhin was fully mature as an artist....but still, Menuhin own teacher was and still is the Master of the Sonatas and Partitas. Listening to Enescu's recordings leave a permanent impact on your soul! Get them instead and be ready to go through a life altering experience!"
1,The Herbal Encyclopedia,"I regret ordering this book. I wanted an herbal book that listed the properties and use of each plant. Not only does the format make it very hard to find specific information, it is more a book that pushes paganism and all types of cults. If I had known this, I would not have bought it."
2,"Educating, but different","I didn't really care for this book, it referenced a lot of non-Biblical spirits. So this one wasn't for me. It was educating, but didn't have all the herbs available to me in the US. I was looking for something more factual and herbal educational."
4,Amazing Instrumentals,Rhythmatism and Summer Strut are incredibly dance-oriented tracks. You Are The Song features an amazing female vocalist (Googie Coppola). The Munich tracks are much less vibrant although Birdwalk is a very haunting track.
4,Good Book,Certainly appreciate how simple it is to understand without being too wordy. I certainly appreciate the Real World sections
3,Not as good a design as old cover,"In comparing the design of the 9914 to the design of my old cover (which lasted 8 years in the Arizona sun), I was disappointed. Admittedly, time will tell whether this is a good cover; however, my old one had elastic on both sides on the inside of the cover, and fit very snugly on the grill. Never once did it blow off despite the regular monsoon winds we experience that cause our trees to topple over. The 9914 has velcro on the outside. To connect the sides snugly, the top hook tab of the velcro must be pulled far over to the end of the bottom loop velcro tab, which means only a couple of inches of the velcro is actually linked - a far weaker closure than I would like to have. Also when it is adjusted to be snug, it looks bunched instead of the clean lines in the product picture. It is also of a lighter weight than my original grill cover."
5,1 year old favorite,"Colorful, with nice and different touching xperiences. The size is great...really big!! Totally worth it!"
2,Disappointed...,"I bought this becasue we all love Violet's House, and I thought this might be similar. Our 1 yr old son LOVES touch and feel books. It does have great pictures and colors, and our son loves the size of the book (nice and big). He likes some of the textures, though most are a bit odd, and don't always feel like what they represent. My biggest gripe is the text. It doesn't talk about the pictures, like in Violet's House where every feely item is described in the text so we can direct his attention to different parts of the page as we read. This just rambles on with a lot of adjectives, and I don't think they mean anything to a child because they're not really in any sort of context that indicates their meaning. So rather than ramble on with a bunch of meaningless words, I tend to sing Old MacDonald as another reviewer suggested. I wanted to like this book, but it is a disappointment. If you don't already have it, I highly recommend Violet's House instead. Hope this helps."
5,Great Book To Learn Animals,"I got this book for my daughter from our library, and she loves it so much I may need to buy it. The touch and feel are so unique. She especially loves the horse's main and the cow's fur. I love how each line of the text repeats the animals' names. This is one of her favorite books to pick up and ""read"" on her own. The first time we heard her say ""cow"" we looked and she had the book on her lap open to the cow page. The only downer is that the chicken's feathers can be pulled out."
5,This book is worth every penny,My daughter LOVES this book. It's fun for her to touch the animals and feel the different textures.
5,Love this for my bird.,I use this for my bird because it will build up the immune system. He's an African grey parrot and does well on flower remedies. I like this one because it is non-alcholic. He gets 5 drops a day. I can tell he feels better right away when he takes it.
1,"If you're looking for a guy who twists scripture, this is it!","Overall, the book is geared towards men who are married, not men in general. I did the kindle sample for a couple of days and thought that it would be a pretty good book to have. I was wrong. The first few that are samples are great, but shortly after that the book tanks towards media bashing and twisting scripture around. The book is set up with a chunk of scripture to read and then the key verse is pulled out of it for emphasis. The problem is the ""key verse"" gets twisted around to fit whatever the guy wants to talk about and most of the time has nothing to do with the context of the chunk lined out in the book. I don't know why it got higher reviews from others, but this is definitely not a good devotional book to do if you aren't married or if you don't like twisted verses."
3,"Fox Searchlight Spotlight Series, Vol #4","This is the fourth three disc set being released by Fox Studios under their Searchlight Spotlight Series. This three disc set contains Garden State, Sideways and Thank You For Smoking. Vol #1 contains Napoleon Dynamite, Little Miss Sunshine and Juno. Vol #2 contains The Full Monty, Bend It Like Beckham and Waitress. Vol #3 contains Boys Don't Cry, Antwone Fisher and The Last King Of Scotland. All four volumes are being released around the same time. Would be nice if amazon.com would add this type of information instead of just listing a generic title and leaving the customer to wonder what movies are contained on the three discs in each respective volume."
5,Inside Nazi Germany,A very interesting description of a country that just couldn't live without a good war in progress! A good example of why dictators are not good for any country.
4,Dance Pad,"I read all the reviews on the cheap dance pads and decided that I'd spend a little more on this one. I couldn't get a hang of it at first, and assumed that the pad wasn't connecting right with the game, but then I decided that I just hadn't played in so long. Also though, the pad does move constantly on carpet, so something will have to go under the pad so it doesn't move, because it will screw you up. Other than that though, good quality and worth it if you do want something that will last."
3,Where's the pot?,"Make sure you realize that the pan this thing fits into is NOT included! Works well, just more expensive if you don't already have a pan that will fit this..."
3,1954 MONO CD,"NOWHERE IN THE INFORMATION ON THIS CD DOES IT TELL YOU THAT IT IS IN MONO UNTIL YOU ACTUALLY SEE THE BACK OF THE PACKING! Maybe it JUST became available, however it was recorded in 1950 and 53-53, originally released in 54. Digitally remastered in 90 and 91.This has all the excitement of a live performance (coughing, cracking tenors and horns). It's a good blend of voices compared to others where the sopranos are overly dominant. If you're looking for an economical way to practice your part, it will work. If you're looking to fill your church with great sound, you'll have to spend more money."
1,wasnt what i wanted,i wanted memory for my ibook not desktop but i returned it for a refund not a full refund and it took a while
4,Why Didn't the Showtime Seasons make DVD Release?,"It was only through Wikipedia that I found out this series ran for two or three additional seasons on Showtime with stars John Houseman and James Stephens reprising the roles they played on the two-year CBS run in these two DVD sets covering the CBS years. I've never been a subscriber to Showtime, so I didn't even know that the series lasted long enough for Hart to graduate law school after the ""crossover"" to Showtime."
4,"""Humanity Comes of Age""","A mission study resource with a globalized view of how to empower and liberate our ageing populations, not just occupy their time with harmless pastimes and ""numbing down."""
4,Wooden pound a peg,I bought the toy for a 2 year old boy and he liked it but his 3 year old sistertook it and started playing with it. It looks very durable and bright colors.I would recommend it.
2,Broke after 1 day!,Too bad this toy broke after 1 day of VERY mild use. I love the concept and my 15 month old was having fun with it until one of the sides fell off.
1,don't buy this toy!,"This toy is not built right. Some of the pegs pound through easily, some won't pound through at all, and some pound through by barely touching it with the hammer. I don't understand how this is supposed to be fun at all. It's more frustrating than anything. Plus the hammer can be very dangerous if your child decides hitting people is a lot more fun than the toy (which is very likely to happen)."
2,Not worth the money,The pegs would fall through the holes. I would not suggest purchasing this item. Very very unhappy with this toy..
1,what the heck?,"I bought this for my young grandson (18 months), remembering the fun of pounding the wooden pegs. But there's nothing to pound here. The pegs just slide through the holes with a little push. Big disappointment."
1,Pegs fall right thru.,The pegs fall right thru the holes..... no pounding required. It was purchased early as a Christmas gift so until it was opened and discovered it didn't work like it's supposed to it was too late to return.
3,peg holes need to be adjusted often,"very colorful and the kids love playing with it, but I find that the peg holes need to be adjusted fairly often so that the pegs don't just fall through when put into the holes. still a pretty good purchase for our 1 year old"
1,Not the Classic Toy You're Expecting,"The pounding bench was one of my favorite toys growing up so I was excited to see Melissa and Doug made a true version of it. Unfortunately, this toy is a peice of junk. The pegs are not held in tight against the wood. There's a plastic ring inside the bench holes that's supposed to hold the pegs tight. Our plastic is so weak that the toy is useless. Some of the pegs don't catch at all, some fall through just with the force of turning the bench over, and ALL of the pegs need only one tiny tap to cause them to drop all the way down."
1,Disappointed,"There is no resistance in the pegs, and usually they fall down and out without needing a hammer. I was hoping the kids could work on pounding the pegs down, rather than trying to keep them in and up long enough to swing the hammer. I'm going to see if my husband can fix this toy to make it something that doesn't frustrate the 2 and 4 year olds using it, and so possibly it will entertain them in a positive way instead."
2,Don't buy it,"My Grandsons received this and were not hard on it, but it fell apart the 2nd day. The pegs also fall out. I was so disappointed and frustrated. I bought this one because it was Melissa and Doug, and they are always good quality. The one I bought also said deluxe, so I thought it would be better than the one I could buy at Walmart or etc. I would not buy this."
1,Disappointing,"I purchased this toy from a local toy shop last week. I have a 16 month old grandson and recall that the concept of this toy was a favorite of his mother's at the same age. I was so excited when I got home that I threw away the packaging along with the receipt. The next day when my grandson came and played with the toy I realized that things aren't like they used to be. He needn't bang on the pegs with the hammer, as they easily slid through the holes by him just touching them with his hand. It wasn't long and the pieces were all over the place and he lost interest. I see now that they do have a similar toy where the pegs don't fall out but they didn't have that particular toy at our store. I also see that this toy has been recalled due to paint issues.....that's scary....I've heard alot about this company but I'm not sure I will be a returning customer."
4,Good toy and good price (updated post),"UPDATEMelissa and Doug sent us a new toy and it works really well. My son enjoys it. Says a lot about a company that wants to make things right.The replacement toy has none of the problems the first toy had so it must have been a bad batch. Previously I said I regretted the purchase. I am now glad that we got it. THANK YOU MELISSA AND DOUG---------[previous post]-----------Pegs just slide through the holes with gravity... no need for a hammer. We tried to play with the plastic tension pieces and it helped some but the pegs are different widths so they tend to slide right on through the holes before you can hit them with the hammer. Not fun, poor quality. Regret the purchase."
1,pegs fall right through,"We received this toy as a Christmas gift and right out of the box the pegs just fell through the holes. There is no resistance at all. My brother had one of these for years that you had to work and work at to get them to go through. I see a few negative reviews from around the time we got ours, maybe there was a bad batch made? It's a great toy if it works correctly."
1,Not impressed,"This toy is just too poor of quality. It fell apart the next day given that my toddler was not rough with it at all. The pegs don't fit well either. Unfortunately this is not the first product from Melissa and Doug I purchased that is of really low quality. I am just going to pass on their toys from now on, there are many better quality wooden toys out there these days."
1,not designed like the old days,"I purchased this toy after having one for my 7 yr old when he was a baby. Although it would make a great toy and work on motor skills, this toy is junk. The holes the pegs go in are too big. My baby can just pull them out or push them down without any effort. Very disappointed!"
3,Surprisingly breakable,"I grew up with this kind of toy, so I wanted my son to enjoy it too. I was surprised and disappointed to discover that my 7 month old son could break it. The end came off the main piece you put the pegs in. It's not hard to make a durable wooden kids toy, so I'd guess corners have been cut somewhere. The one I grew up with lasted a couple of generations."
1,Poor choice,I purchased this toy for my 2 year old granddaughter. She doesn't play with it because the pegs fall right out. They aren't tight enough to make for a very satisfying hammering experience.
4,Son has been playing with this for over a year,"My son enjoys this toy and has been pounding away at it for over a year. We've never had any problems with pegs not fitting or things falling apart (and my son is not gentle on it, I assure you). It's not his favorite toy in the world, but when he gets the urge to bang, it provides a good outlet. It's also helped to reinforce his understanding of colors. For the price, I'd say it's a good deal."
3,Melissa & Doug Wooden Pound a peg - hit or miss,"I was somewhat disappointed with this toy. The pegs fit way too loose. My 2 y.o. would just push them through with her fingers and then they'd fall out once they were over half way through the hole. I didn't want to mess with exchanging it for a only a chance at getting a better one, so I fixed it myself. It was a little tedious, but I took out the plastic ring from each hole, added a narrow strip from an index card (twice the width of the hole and then doubled over) and reinserted the ring. It works fine now. I think Melissa & Doug make great products, but they need to step it up on quality control. It seems most of the things they sell have at least a few reviews about them being faulty one way or another. It hasn't made me not buy their toys, but I don't buy them now unless I can see and touch them to make sure of their condition. I would love to buy their stuff from Amazon, but that's reason I don't anymore."
3,POUND A PEG REVIEW,"I FOUND THIS TOY TO BE DURABLE AND COLORFUL, AND SHOULD LAST FOR DECADES! MY ONLY DISAPPOINTMENT (AND MY DAUGHTER'S FOR WHOSE CHILDREN IT WAS GIVEN) WAS THAT THE PEGS WERE TOO EASY TO MOVE. THE 2 YEAR OLDS COULD MOVE IT EASILY AND COMPLETELY WITH A PUSH OF THEIR FINGER. THE WHOLE POINT WAS TO POUND IT WITH THE MALLET, ONE WAY AND THEN THE OTHER, BUT THIS VERSION COULD ACTUALLY MOVE THE PEG COMPLETELY OUT OF THE HOLE. (LOST PIECES, POSSIBILITY)"
3,Peg Bench,I was disappointed that the pegs come out so easily. One hit with the hammer and they're done. When my children were small they had a toy like this but the pegs didn't come all the way out.
4,Good!,I bought this toy for 3 year old son who is in occupational therapy. He has weak muscles and hammering is one of the assignments that he has been given. He loves it. The only downside is that the rubber seal inside each hole (that provides resistance for the pegs) is wearing down quickly.
1,Fell apart,My 15 month old petite granddaughter opened this and when she went to play with it the pegs can be pulled out and pushed through no pounding needed at all then the one end came completely off . Poor quality indeed.
1,Would be a great toy,"This toy feel apart on us not once but three times. First the head fell off the hammer the very first time my son used it. My husband thought that they had just not glued it well enough and just got out the wood glue to fix it no soon then we gave it to my son again and one of the sides fell off. My son is a typical little boy but he is not hard on his toys and was not using this in an unusual way. He has a similar toy at the montessori school that he goes to and loves it, but this is just too frustrating for him. We will be returning this toy and complaining to the manufacturer. It has the potential of being a 4 star toy if the thing would just stay together."
1,Holes were too big for the pegs,"I usually rave about Melissa & Doug Toys, but this one is awful! We took it out of the packaging and some of the pegs fell right to the ground through the holes. The holes were not all the same sizes (though they are supposed to be), nor were the pegs because there were some pegs that would work in certain holes and not others, but there were some holes that none of the pegs fit in without falling through. Some pegs were super tight in certain holes and couldn't be pounded properly without lots of force and others were pretty loose and one pound would knock them through. I ended up just pitching it after a while as there was no learning benefit to the toy. It was a gift, so I didn't have a receipt for it. The other reviewrs mentioned problems with the hammer... We never had any troule with it."
1,Very disappointed,"I was expecting an old fashioned wooden pound-a-peg that my grandson could pound with the wooden mallet. This was not it. It is slick and shiny - that's o.k. except there is no resistance for the pegs. They slide almost without being touched. My grandson loved the original wooden one that he could actually hammer. This one can't be hammered, the pegs simply fall thru, except for one that was stuck when I received it and even with hammering it hasn't budged. He and I are very disappointed in the Wooden Poundless-Peg toy."
3,Just Didn't Hold Up At All,"I'm a big fan of Melissa and Doug toys for my baby, who is now a toddler. In general, Melissa and Doug makes educational, sturdy toys you can be confident and comfortable in giving your child.Unfortunately, my experience with the pound-a-peg was not so great. The first unit we bought we had the pegs ""lose"" their shape and start falling through the holes after just a few plays, and this is when our little one was >1, so not a real heavy-hitter. Melissa and Doug were very responsive and immediately sent us a new one, after a quick phone call to their customer service center (where you actually speak to a live person; kudos!).Unfortunately, we had the same problem with the second set, and then some. Not only did the pegs lose their pound-ability but the hammer also feel apart, repeatedly.All in all, I think Melissa and Doug make great products--and I continue to frequent them as a company--but this one just didn't seem to hold up."
2,"Not as good as the old one -- Playskool, maybe?","My kids loved the old pound-a-peg. But this one is narrower, so it's more apt to fall over. One of the pegs is just a bit too small, so it falls out. I was disappointed."
2,Very disappointing,"I purchased this for my two year old for Christmas. I was very disappointed in the quality and function of this toy. The pegs are so loose that sometimes they fall through the hole before my son has a chance to pound them with the hammer. After one day of light use, both red ends fell off and will have to be glued. There are already marks in the wood from the hammer. Overall a very disappointing purchase. The name Melissa & Doug used to mean something..."
1,The pegs fell out,"I have just watched my granddaughter open her pound-a-peg. As soon as the plastic wrapping was removed all the pegs fell out. No pounding required. I would return it but it has already been handed over as a gift. Although the picture looked good, I should have read the reviews. Lots of negatives. I am now one of the negatives. Do not buy this product!"
4,Good for a two or three year old,"We bought this toy along with the pound-a-ball toy for our small 18 mos. old son. He likes it, but seems to enjoy the ease of the pound-a-ball toy more. This toy is better off for a two or three year old, as it is recommended. My older girls (3, 6 and 7 years old), enjoy it. The pegs do take some effort to get down at times and at other times they seem to go through easily. But, every one enjoys pounding on it, nonetheless. I would recommend it and buy it again. No regrets."
1,Do not buy this product.,I bought this for my nephew. All of the pegs fall right through the holes. There is no pounding required. I think my nephew would have loved it if it had worked like it was supposed to. I would have sent it back if I had all of the packaging. I definitely would not recommend it.
4,Fun for a 2 year old,"Great toy, teaches colors and orginaztion. Our 2 year old loves it unill the side of the peg holder came unglued, then the head of the hammer came off. Nice, but could be put together more securely."
3,Good educational toy but sides came unglued,"This is a great toy and my son has been playing with it for some time but... a week after he got it, the red sides came unglued. We glued it back together with stronger glue, no big deal. If you buy this be sure to have some wood glue handy just in case."
2,Impossible!,"We bought this toy for my 2 year old and it's completely unusable. I'm thinking of calling the manufacturer. The holes are too small for the majority of the pegs. Unless you bang the pegs REALLY hard with the hammer, they do not budge. I can't even get some of them through the holes and my husband gets them, but he has to hit it very hard with the mallet. My daughter gets frustrated with it since she bangs it with the hammer and it doesn't budge."
4,good not great,This product is good for learning how to it things precisely. Maybe I got it too late for my son. He pretty much hit all the pegs through a couple times and now he's lost interest. He was 20 months when I got it so I think he was past it. He now likes using the hammer on the doors or daddy. He just pushes the pegs through with his hand. Mostly he ignores it. I think it would be better for a younger baby.
1,Great toy but falls apart and paint comes off,"My children loved this toy but the sides fell off within a week and paint chips off very easily. I did expect paint to come off since there is friction involved, but not within a few days after we just bought it. I did contact Melissa and Doug company and they said they would look into the quality of the product (sending a box so I can return it to them, along with others I bought that did the same). It may be a bad paint batch but I do think parents need to be aware that the sides fell off easily (they do snap back on, though you really need glue to keep it workable) and the paint coming off is not good for young children who might put it in their mouth."
3,Needs a tighter fit to last for older children,"This is nicely made as far as assembly, paint, etc. My only complaint is that it's a little too easy to pound the pegs down. My 14 month old is interested, but my 30 month old can push the pegs through with her hands. Fun for a small while, but not a long-term toy. BTW- We have another set that is plastic that is really loose and this isn't that bad. Maybe I have unrealistic expectations?"
2,New production kind of lacking,"I know that this toy has been around for several generations and in theory is a great toy. However, when I got the one I just recently ordered, I was sad to discover that the product design has slightly changed and almost makes the toy unusable. There used to be a rubber ring that sat in the holes to keep the pegs firmly stable so you can ""pound the pegs"" but they new design has a very loose ring and the pegs barely stay in the main wood frame. They fall out so easily, there's really no pounding of the pegs that gets to be done as the pegs basically just fall through the holes."
2,Disappointing.,"We got this toy as a Christmas present. If you are looking for a toy like the one back in the day, this isn't it. The pegs basically fall through the holes. No hammering necessary. Disappointing."
1,Product fell apart,This toy was very disappointing. Both end pieces fell off & several of the holes were too big to hold the pegs. They would just fall through. This product was atypical for a Melissa & Doug production.
1,Huge disappointment,"I was so excited for my son (2yo) to receive this toy, as it's been on our wish list for a while. However he has no interest in it, and I can't blame him! The pegs are too thin and slip through the holes before he has a chance to use the hammer. We've already lost one peg because it fell out somewhere and I'm sure others are right behind it. We usually love Melissa and Doug, so this was really a huge disappointment."
1,Disappointing,"You won't have to worry about telling the child you get this for to stop banging. The pegs are so not form fitting that they fall right through the holes, not banging needed. Bought 2 for 2 grandsons and was saddened to it didn't work as it should. If you are looking for a toy that kids can put pegs in holes and have them fall out the other side when they pick it up, then this is the toy for you. Otherwise don't waste your money (and their time)."
1,Dreadful,"Overall, we've always been happy with Melissa & Doug's toys, but this one is pretty useless. The pegs fall easily through the holes, so we have to keep picking them up and the hammer isn't even needed. Unfortunately, it's all unwrapped now and our grandchild enjoys using the hammer for other things, so we can't return it, but do have sense enough not to buy it!"
1,JUNK!,Do not waste your time buying this! I really enjoyed playing with pound a pegs as a kid and recently purchased this one for my daughter as I thought she would like it too. She opened it on Christmas and it is a piece of junk. The holes are too big for the pegs and they fall out when you pick it up and then right through the holes when you put them in. No POUNDING needed.I am very disappointed! This will be getting returned immediately and I will be thinking twice before purchasing any Melissa and Doug toys in the future. I will find one from a different company that does what it is supposed to do.
1,Terrible!!,"I bought this toy for full price from a local toy store (so I didn't read any reviews first). As soon as we opened the toy 1 peg literally fell right through the hole it was resting in. We got this toy so she could hammer like her dad, but instead, she lost interest after a few minutes of barely tapping the pegs and having them fall through the holes. I contacted Melissa and Doug Customer service (thinking it was a fluke) and never heard back from them. Because of the poor customer service and the poor quality of some of their toys, I will likely not be purchasing any more Melissa and Doug toys."
1,Loose Pegs,I looked around many places and was happy when I found the wooden pound-a-peg. Both my sons had them and loved them as kids. I purchased this for my grandson. But the holes are too big and the pegs just slide straight through. He doesn't even need the hammer. He tossed it aside after about 3 minutes. The one my sons' had had pegs that were snug and they could actually hammer the pegs not tap them and they fall through.
2,Not a good pound-a-peg,"The pegs in this toy are way too loose in the holes. They give almost no resistance, so it takes away all the fun for the child when the peg practically slides out without being hit with the mallet. I should have listened to the negative reviews. Melissa and Doug products are usually so wonderful, I just couldn't imagine not being pleased with something they put out. This, however, is not a good pound-a-peg. It might work for a young baby (7-10 months or so) but is just too easy for a child any older. I would not purchase this product again, nor would I recommend it."
2,Pound a peg,"Little disappointed, instead of using the hammer, my daughter just uses her finger to push down the pegs. Wish the toy was a bit better constructed."
5,Great,"I love it! I can always here my kitty coming! It was in perfect condition. If my cat manages to lose this one, I know I will purchase another one just like it."
1,Stretched and corroded in less than a week,"I thought new springs would be the answer to the lack of bounce on our three year old trampoline. They were awesome - for about four days. By then they had stretched out and lost their shine (they developed a powdery coating). I expected better performance for a hundred and twenty bucks. If anyone wants to share information on springs that work well and last longer than a week, I'm all ears. Thanks!"
4,Letter Perfect,"My Summary:This book is about three boys, Chad, B.J. and Toad. They plan little crimes for practice. If they succeed in the practice, they will plan a big crime. Though originally they were not supposed to actually carry out the crime. They leave letters anonymously to their hated teacher MR. Patterson. The letters are demands for money . If he does not give them the money, they will give a letter to the school board sent from one of his Navy friends. It says that he cracks under pressure and he had a military background. This little joke is getting bigger and bigger. They are ruining this poor man's life and are committing some serious crimes. Will these kids get caught? What will the teacher do about it? Read this book to find out.It is a pretty good book. Some language may not be appropriate for young readers."
3,jilala hadra recorded indoors,for some the problem with this recording is that because it was recorded indoors the sound of the drums (bendir) overwhelm the flutes (qasba or shebbaba) echoing off the walls...unless you are sitting right next to the flutes this is the way it sounds.....there is another recording of jilala taken in a tent and the flutes come through clearly....
2,Production values substandard,This recording is actually quite old and it shows. The production values are low enough to make this of little interest except for ethnomusiologists or very serious students of Islamic mysticism.
3,"Mabel, Concert II -- Beware","The second disc of this set, appropriately, contains the second concert with Bobby Short. Mabel fans beware -- her voice is in shreds by this time, which is not to say she still isn't one of the ultimate diseuses. But it is a bit sad to hear this great singer reach for notes long out of her reach and waver with short breath on many that still are. This would be a terrible and unflattering introduction for those unfamiliar with her work. She's much better on the first concert. But to hear her in her glory, try ""The Art of Mabel Mercer"" on which she sounds truly like the great singer she was."
5,Alot of room,This suitcase has alot of character. The cab part opens with a zipper as does Thomas' face as extra room for socks or the little things kids can't leave home without. Its perfect for that sleepover at grandma's house but I'm also amazed that we can get all my son's clothes in this suitcase for a 5 day trip as well. I think it has to do with the soft sides. Love it!
5,Excellent - a fantastic CD!,"I can't say enough about this collection of some of Irving Berlin's finest songs. It's Berlin at his best, with many past and present, but all great, performers doing the singing."
3,Not enough songs!,I love Irving Berlin but was disappointed that there are only 12 tracks on this CD - he wrote hundreds of songs.
4,"THIS review is for ""Honorary White"" by E.R. Braithwaite (see discussion below)","This is about the author of ""To Sir, With Love"" going to South Africa while apartheid is still in effect. Again, as in ""A Kind of Homecoming,"" he is a witness to history, and it's always more interesting to read a first-hand witness's accounts than just the usual media ""sound bites""--especially a witness who's always so honest about his reactions and feelings (e.g. actual dismay at having his visa application APPROVED after he learned the South African government had UNbanned his writings--reminded me of when I asked my parents if I could go to my first dance in junior high & was COUNTING on their ""no"" as an excuse for avoiding something I was scared to death of, and then they said ""yes,"" leaving me having to either find another excuse or face my fears!) The title comes from how the South Africans considered him in order for him to get treatment and prvileges that the resident blacks were denied."
4,A good but altering book,"I thought that this book was good, but it was a little toodescriptive of death at some parts. Well, in the beginning,the story was nice, but it was not written well. This littlegirl just went 60 years back in time and, Wala! Presto!She was adjusted, and excepting the fact that she could beabout to die any moment! Then, as the story went on, thewritten part of the story became really good, but the storybecame a little deathly. It really made me think differentlyabout any book I read from then on that had death in it.Besides that, I thought the book was pretty good about grabbingyou into the story, and making the story interesting for my agegroup of 11-12. I recommend this story to most people, but notto those who get very altered by death.-Katharine Manning,American School In Japan, 6th grade."
4,This book was interesting but a little confusing!,"This book started out good but ended up kind of confusing and weird.I thought this book was a bit too short but not that short.This book's story was very interesting so I really got into reading this book.But some parts of this book I didn't quite understand that well.For example, I didn't get the ending that much because it was too hard tounderstand. But overall this book was pretty good. Steven Yum, American School in Japan, 6th grade."
4,It talks about holocaust,"It is a story about the young girl who overcame horrible holocaust during World War2. Actually it took a long time to finish this book, also it was really hard to understand. But it taught a lot of things about life and people. And what I like to tell you about this book is author's writing way. I like that author's own writing way. She used a lot of figurative words. Anyway, I really loved that kind of way. And Jay Yollen wrote this book like she overcame that kind of event already. Also it was pretty emotional book. I want to be a author like Jay Yollen. As a one of the book that talked about important history at 20th centry. You will really enjoy this book. You'll be satisfied with this book, I promise..."
4,This book is great if your into the holocust!,The setting of this book made it a great reading choice. I thought it was realy great how one minnute Hannah is in New Rochell and the next she is transformed to lublin Germany durring the time of the holocust.It was great how she relived world war 2
4,We thought it was very suspenseful and SADISTIC!,It was an extraordinarily fun book to read and discuss. I read this book in seventh grade and I have been haunted by nightmares about this terrifying piece of literature for all the years since. Overall it was a great and completely engrossing novel. :-)
2,Terrible ending!,"Sure, when you pick up the book you think, wow, this reviewer doesn't know what she's saying. well i do. and i say that the beginning is good. the middle is good. the ending is TERRIBLE!It just ends. Pitstop. She's back. that's all. blah. Like someone just ripped pages out from the end! my eyes were reading the ending pages just about...10,000,000,000,000,000 times. But my brain still couldn't comprehend it! It's like Jane Yolen had another idea and just said... ""and she lived happily ever after. the end."" one of the worst of Jane Yolen's books...EVER. What a disgrace!"
3,from a teacher's perspective,"I ordered this book from Scholastic for my classroom. After reading it, I realize that it is more suited for Jr. High or High School students than 4th graders. Although I think that younger students benefit from learning about the Holocaust, I think books more like Number the Stars are more age appropriate for 9 and 10 year olds. being sent to a concentration camp. The story told has a magical element of time travel, that she had a hard time selling to me. However, the purpose and story is there."
2,The Devils Arithmetic,"I think this book was twice as boring as schhool. The author (Jane Yolen) wasen't very specific about what happened. I think she should of translated the Yettish into English, so I could understand what was going on.If you like WWII and Holocaust books this ones for you.The book did have a good plot,But I coulden't wait for this book to get over. So in conclusion,this book was boring.By the way your better off seeing the movie!"
5,the devil's arthmetic is great,It is a good book about hannah's life. I love the part where hannah is dreaming about the death camps its sad what happens to hannah but she tryed saving other people and did good deeds for other people.She had a good life tell she dream about the death camps run by adolf hitler.We just read this book in english class wgere done with the book know were going to watch the movie in class im 13 not 12 and my name is Jeremy.
3,Robbie's Thoughts on The Devil's Arithmetic,"Do you like to read books about WWII? This is a pretty good fiction book about it.One day Hannah went to her Grandpa Will's house, but she didn't want to. At her grandpa's she had to open the door for a prophet called Elijah. When she opened the door all of the sudden she was in Poland 1942. She tells her new friends that she made in Poland. She told her friends about some new movies that she saw. At Fayge's wedding the Nazis came and took all the people and put them on boxcars to go to a concentration camp. She met a girl named Rivka. When she got home she talked to her Aunt Eva. Hannah (Chaya) found out that Aunt Eva was Rivka.I liked the book. Before I read the whole book I wondered how she got home. I would really want to read a sequel to this book. I rate this book three star because it was a good book and had lots of mystery, like how Hannah would get home and how she got to Poland."
4,must read,"This book is about a girl trying to understand a tragedy that her relatives lived through, the holocost. When the 12yr. old girl Hannah goes back in time to the holocost, she realizes what a terrible time it was and the horrors her relatives went through. I really enjoyed this book and every moment is described in elaborate detail making you feel as if you were there. This is one of the best books I ever read. I recomend this book to anyone that is interested in history."
4,The Devil's Arithmetic,"If you are looking for a great WWII book I suggest that you check out ""The Devil's Arithmetic"" by Jane Yolen. It is a story about a young girl who doesn't fully understand the importance of passover or her elders until one passovers meal. The plot is easy to understand. Even young kids could probably understand it. The author,Jane Yolen, probably did some research before writing the book. It is a very realistic book, and the characters are really realistic too. So remember if you are looking for a great book that has to deal with WWII I suggest that you check out ""The Devil's Arithmetic"" by Jane Yolen."
5,An important book for all ages to read,"I read The Devil's Arithmetic when I was about 11. Now, I am 17 and I still rate it as one of my favorite books of all time. It is an excellent book that every child should read. The message is an important one: remember. Remember what others had to go through so that we could have the life we have now. This message not only applies for Jews, but for all races and religions. We should all remember and never forget."
4,The Devils Arithmetic,"The Devil's Arithmetic by Jane Yolen is a story about a young Jewish girl named Hannah, who during a Passover celebration, finds herself back in time, in a small Jewish village in Poland, in the 1940's! While there, during a wedding, Hannah and the other vilagers are taken away by the Nazis, to a concentration camp. At ther camp Hannah finds it harder and harder to remember things from the future, and what will happen to her and the Jews at the camp. Well I personally thought this book was great, it shows you how terrible things were then, and it keeps your attention by making you wonder if she'll ever get home. But unfournatly this book doesn't grab your attention till around the middle of the story. Now I would recomend this book for teens to adults since they will understand it better. So if you like exciting Holocaust books go out and read The Devils Arithmetic."
3,A bit of a Disappointment...,"We found Devil's Arithmetic not as good as it was portrayed to be. It was good, but it was lacking a good ending. The ending seemed to be written in a few minutes, like it was written in a hurry. It had excellent character portrayal, Jane Yolen wrote it as if she was watching this happen. She also adds plenty of detail, putting a perfect picture in your mind...despite some of the pictures being gruesome. If you enjoy serious books, this would be perfect for you to read.(...) 6th Grade"
2,You Can't Replace the Real Thing,"I am sorry, but no fiction novel will ever replace that of a true memoir. Yes, it was written for kids, but I read my first Holocaust novel at age nine without major trauma. The plot is somewhat jumbled, but still gets the point across (Which is why it got two stars, instead of one). I feel it does the entire surviving (and not surviving) cast of those who experienced the horrors of the concentration camps a tragic disrespect. If you would like a helpful hint of where to look for a high-quality Holocaust books take a look at my listmania list which has, in my opinion, the top five Holocaust novels of times (All of which are true). And, if you are looking particularlly for a child try my number five choice: Anne Frank."
2,This is an okay book.,The main character is Hannah.She is put into another time period of the Hauiocaust.She has to live with her great aunt and unkle.She has to imagine herself at the siminal to get back home.She does get home!
3,It's boreing at first but then it gets better.,My favorit part in this book was when Hannah meets these girls.I liked when Hannah had to were this ugly soilors dress.This is a grait book to read and plus it has a lot of deatails.The best part was when her family got out of the cosontrasion camp.I think it is a realy good book you should read it some time!!!!!!!
5,Amazing Book!,Fast Shipping. I didn't realize I was getting a hard back but it was a nice surprise! Thank you!
4,in the shoes of your ancestors,As other reviews have said this book is essentially Schindler list but from a child's perspective and i think that is a perfect way to describe it. i think that because it is about a girl who gets to what her grandparents are talking about what they went through but then she actually gets to experience it for herself. she then realizes that the things that would really bug her and she would be annoyed by their stories but she actually experiences it. i sometimes find myself wondering what it was like in the days of my grandparents and wanting to experience it for myself. great book! i recommend it to everyone.
4,A Revealing Tale,"This was the first book that I ever read about the Holocaust that made me realise what kind of horrors these people lived through. The story is based on a character named Hannah, whom I related to very well. She was girl from modern times, who, like many people today, did not respect traditions or the past. By traveling back to 1940's Poland, she experiences the Holocaust herself. The Devil's Arithmatic is a story of Hannah understanding the impact of Nazi rule on the Jewish people.I would highly recommend this book to anyone. Everyone should have the chance to read it at least once in thier lifetime."
5,Must read for YA and middle grade students,"We have a tradition in my family whereby we read a chapter of a book each day at breakfast. The Devil's Arithmetic was our latest read. My sons (14 and 12) are both history buffs, and both loved this book. The main character is Hannah, a 12 year old girl who is often impatient with her family's remembrance of the Holocaust. Her grandfather, in particular, embarrasses her with his rants about the past.During her family's gathering for Passover Seder, Hannah is suddenly transported into the past, where she finds herself captured and taken to a concentration camp. Needless to say, she developes a new understanding and compassion for not only her relatives, but for her Jewish heritage.Author Jane Yolen has crafted a story that makes this time in history real for young readers. My children felt the frustration, the fear, and the sadness as we made our way through this book, and through that they, too, developed a better understanding of this time in history."
4,The Devil's Arithmatic,"The Devil's Arithmatic is a great book by Jane Yolen.It is about a twelve-year-old Jewish girl named Hannah who was tired of remembering the past. During her passover seder with her family she mysteriously gets transported tothe year 1942 during World War Two.In the life that she gets transported to she is called Chaya, which means life.(Chaya is Hannah's Jewish name)Chaya is going to her uncle Shmuel's wedding when Nazis come to take them to concentration camps. Only Hannah Knows the Horrors that await them. The Devil's Arithmatic is a historical fiction.The Devil's Arithmatic is a great book and I would recomend you reading it if you are a young adult. It was exciting and sad. I loved reading it and i'm sure that you would to."
4,The Devil's Back,"A Review by BryceThe Devils Arithmetic is a great historical book. The story takes place in The Bronx, then transports you to 1940's Germany. Hannah, the main character, is tired of her grandfather talking about the holocaust. When Hannah wakes up one morning, she is in a small town in Germany. She meets her aunt, Gitl.The historical aspect is right on target. One example of this is when ""Hannah and gitl are waiting to get their head shaved. Jane Yolen depicts the nazi camps precisely; ""the guards are every where."" This story has a special appeal to me, because I've studied World War 2 since I was able to read. The book has a sad, but serious story line. I would recommend this book to people who are interested in reading about or studying the holocaust. The plot goes the way I wanted it and expected it to."
3,My Review,The Devil's Arithmetic was a very enjoyable book to just sit down and read. The book was mostly about the Holocaust and WWll. It's main character is Hannah. The book tells many details about Hannah and the way she feels. I highly recommend this book if you are interested in WWll.
4,This is The Devils Arithmetic!,This book was about a girl named Hannah who goes to a passover seder. Ends up doing a special tradition and all of a sudden ends up in a Polish shetl in 1940. The town gets invaded and she ends up in a concentration camp. Terrible things happen but she ends up back in the present as if no time has passed. The novel was a very unique way to present a perspective of the holocaust.
4,The Holocaust through the eyes of a young girl.,"I liked this book because of the ways the author wrote facts about the Holocaust , and how your ideas changed about why Hannah was there. I also liked how realistic the characters were and the details about what was going on. There were some parts that didn't tell enough information though.Ashlee R"
5,My Favorite Book,"When I was first asked to read this book by my favorite teacher, I was not very excitied. I was singled out of the class by her because she believed that I could handle the subject matter. As I got farther and farther into the book, I relized exactly what the author was trying to say. She used the mettaphor, ""The Devil's Arithmetic"", to show how inhuman the death camps truly were. At first I thought that the sign, ""ARBEIT MACHT FREI"" (work makes you free), was just something thought up by Jane Yolen. However, I came to realize by reading the ""What Is True About This Book"" that this sign also hung in Auschwitz, the worst camp of all. I am almost thirteen, but this continues to remain my favorite book. -Stevee"
5,Powerful reminder of how the past influences the present,"This powerful and well-told story is a sad a reminder of man's inhumanity to man, and why we must continue to educate children (and adults) about the Holocaust. I know of only one other book that is as poignant in its use of a modern and youthful character who is haunted by memories of the Holocaust. Like Hannah in ""The Devil's Arithmetic,"" Zev Segal did not personally experience the horrors of the Holocaust - but his nightmares teach him an important lesson of why we must never forget. Although not a children's book, ""Abraham, Isaac, Jacob & Zev"" by Jerry Marcus should be on the bookshelf right next to ""The Devil's Arithmetic."""
2,"Nasty, would avoid","I bought one of these as a meal replacement bar at work one day. The taste is like super thick card board. The chocolate and caramel themselves taste good but the internal portion, which I'm not really sure what its made from, tastes like taffy flavored with dirt. I was starving and could not bring myself to finish the last half. I guess in that respect, it saved me some calories so maybe it does work well as a diet product."
5,score one for the metrosensitive male,"I was given this book as a gift, and was admitedly a little skeptical about reading (and enjoying) what I saw as a memoir of a post dot-commer set in the truly hollow neighborhood of San Francisco's Cow Hollow. But I was pleasantly surprised by both the author's natural flair for language and description and his sincere attempt to record his experiences with love and relationships with honesty and self-reflection. Looking forward to Jeremy Dann's second novel..."
1,Vacuous drivel,"I found this book in a box on a sidewalk in San Francisco. You know, the box of books that nobody buys at somebody's garage sale which gets left on the street for free. Thank goodness I didn't pay for it because it's awful. While the descriptions of post-boom San Francisco are well done, they don't redeem this novel. The characters are a bunch of vacuous San Francisco yuppies who drift randomly from wine and cheese parties to travels in France, Las Vegas, and LA. There is the tiniest wisp of a plot to string the reader along. At one point I began to suspect that the author actually intended to display these characters as a bunch of sniveling twits, but sadly, he really is earnest about them. There is no message whatsoever in this novel."
3,"it's okay, but not what I needed","it's a good system. seems to work as well as it's predecessor without the chance of warping that was a possibility in the previous model. However, I wanted to fix my kids' game cube disks and this has no option for that at all. The accessory for the smaller disks doesn't work with this machine."
5,Breathtaking!,"This is a breathtaking, beyond-beautiful book of ethnic bracelets. If you're a jewlery artist, you will gain a tremendous amount of inspiration from this coffee-table (NOT a how-to) book. I highly recommend it."
3,Not the best cooking book,"Although it does have some good and quick recipes, it's more of a story book than a cookbook for men."
2,"Cool pendant,cheap necklace","Pendant is a cool expression of Scandinavian heritage. However, after about 4 months of wear the necklace broke. Need a better quality necklace to wear it with..."
2,Worked fine for 1 year,"For the price difference I went with the Opteka over Cannon release. For the most part it worked well for a year before failing in the middle of this years 4th of July fireworks. I am not sure how much the failure affected my shots, but I will spend the extra on the Canon product to replace this one."
4,Opteka remote release cord,Product arrived on time and packaged well. Works as advertised and a much better price then the Canon release. I have only used this release a couple of times so that's why I only gave it a 4 star rating. Happy with the purchase.
5,All you need in a remote cable release,"I was initially wary of Opteka's quality, however, after receiving the product I've been very happy with its quality and construction. The remote is solid, not flimsy, and works as advertised to allow you to take photos with your tripod-mounted camera with no shake or movement to blur the image. It is especially useful for long exposure shots. I'm impressed with Opteka's engineering and will seriously consider their other products. It's far cheaper than Canon's remote, so it is an excellent buy."
1,Very LOW quality,"This item is very LOW quality. I ordered two of these (one for a back up). BOTH of them stopped working after one or two days. Both had LOW QUALITY electrical wire in which one or more inner wires separated/broke making them useless. I repaired them and in a short time the inner wires separated/ broke in another spot. I finally cut the original wire out and spliced some phone cable between the two ends. They both work now, but the repairs don't look great."
1,Worked for 1 outing...,"I have to give it 1 star because of the build quality. I tested the remote at home and thought it was great. I took it on a trip downtown to take pictures of the city and after around an hour I had to hold the chord at a particular angle get it to engage and focus/shoot, but it did work for 6 hours.For xmas I went on a trip and when I went to use the chord, even holding it at the same angle, I couldn't get it to engage and focus/shoot. It's completely dead. Maybe I could send it back and get it replaced, but then I still wouldn't trust it as my only remote so I'd recommend just getting the next step up to begin with."
1,Bargain Priced Quality,"After about a day of use from this product photographing waterfalls, the unit quit working. I have owned a Canon version and another brand like this and the Canon was by far the best. I had it for 9 years before I lost it. The other brand lasted for 6 months and I thought this would be a better option, but alas I am wrong."
1,Useless for 50D,"Just received one today. When you press the button, it focuses but does not fire. I have seen another reviewer on Amazon who had identical problem--focuses but does not fire. When I tried to remove from the body, it was way too hard. Seemed that you will ruin the three tiny connector pins in the body of 50D. Totally useless for me."
2,Short life span,"I do a lot of real estate photography and end up with long exposures and didn't always just want to use the timer release. The first few times, it worked as advertised. But one day - in the middle of a shoot - it stopped working. As someone else here experienced: the cables separated and rendered the remote useless. $10 for an experience and at least a few shoots. Not going to buy it again. Get what you pay for!"
1,You get what you pay for,"I had my camera equipment stolen and read the reviews on the less expensive Opteka cable release and decided to save a few bucks on the replacement. I have now had 2 and they both have failed within the 1st ten shots. Extremely frustrating when you're in the field and cant't get the shots you have meticulously set up for the right moment. I am going back to the Canon version which worked perfectly for years. Remember, you get what you pay for."
1,This item doe not do its job.,"This device is not particularly nice, and it does not work well. It feels cheap in your hand, and the switch does not have a positive ""click"" letting you know that you have pressed the button. Also, it worked fine when it was new, and now almost does not work at all. I'd say I get a shutter exposure perhaps 1 of every 10 times I press the button.Do yourself a favor and spend an extra $20 for a better alternative. You can go without 3 trips to starbucks to offset the cost."
2,Not good,"It's hard to take it off from your camera, and when it's attaching you can't review your work either do focusing! you have to take it off but it's hard to let it go from your camera cos you're going to be afraid it will break apart and ruined your 40D."
4,Be awesome if someone could indicate the cord length in the ad !!!,Product looks and works great. My only complaint is that there is no indication what length cord is supplied with this (or any other model) remote. this one was around 4ft which is fine for lens work but no good if you want to be in the picture.
2,Not always work!,"Some times it doesn't not work! if I turn on/off the camera, unplug /plug the cord again, it may start work again. what a hassel! Not reliable, so would miss shots!"
1,poor,"Hidden Order is a seminar re-arranged into a book. The outcome is not a good read. It is tedious and lacks interesting cases.If complex adaptive systems are of interest, take a class and skip this book."
5,Buy it.,"Just buy it. Get ""Luminosa"" as well. These two albums are the best I have heard in a long time. I have over 1200 CD's, but selections from this and ""Luminosa"" have been in my MP3 player wearing out duracells for the last 6 months."
4,Outstanding !!!,"This is music that goes directly to your heart. It coocoons your soul with dramatic effects in your mood: from pure magnifiscent joy to some sort of deep nostalgia. Since I found this record by myself, I had -for an instant- the wish to keep this jewel out of the reach of others. Disregard a few ""Enigma"" style songs (drum machines, synth basses,etc.). You will start browsing everywhere to find more of Prizeman (composer) and the singers. You'll definitely love it."
5,Top Bannana Tunes,I heard a freind playing this CD during Christmas '99 and went straight out to get it myself. Robert Prizeman (whoever he is) has done a fantastic job on this CD - when will there be a sequal?
3,Good but not great,"This album was a valiant attempt of a fusion of boys choir with rock/synthesizer music. I heard this album at a listening station at a local bookstore and was blown away by the first track ""Salva Me."" It reminded me a lot of Enigma, only with a young boys choir instead of Gregorian monks. It had a really, really nice beat and uplifting tune. Unfortunately, I didn't find the rest of the album very appealing. Unlike the first track, they were mostly dull and not upbeat (very unlike Enigma). They were mostly soft songs sung by the choir boys. Strange how the album started getting your energy up, but then let you down really fast."
5,Amazing Voices,"These boys continue to amaze me. I am transported when listening to their music. It is uplifting, haunting, invigorating, thoughtful...just incredible."
5,FIVE HIGH-FLYING ANGEL STARS!!!,"The boys' voices of angels and the rythmic bounce of new-age brings together a sound I had been searching for! Unlike some boys' choir music, this CD flows, pounds and changes rythum more often then most. And the track ""Sanctus"" based on Pachelbel's Canon...well you can just imagine yourself how 12 year-old voices can bring that tune to life!"
3,"Tries too hard to be ""cool""","Essentially a new age CD, the attempts to be ""cool"" are overdone and come across as sappy and cliched. For those looking for something sweet and pretty, this is right up your alley. For those who take pleasure in the great English church choirs, you will probably feel like your intelligence is being insulted (which it is); but, like a B movie, if you set your intellect to one side for a while, you can get some enjoyment out of the CD."
4,Awesome Music!!,"Great Mix's!!! A mix of ethnic music/electronica, Saw them live in SF lot's of fun and magick!!!"
3,"Good, but not excellent...","Though the book contains a very good coverage of the breed and substantial pedigree information, most of the material on feeding and training is out of date. The book could benefit from a major editorial update.From a book design point of view, the book lacks professional polish. It is inexcusable that the book has no index."
4,Never Arrived,"I am very familiar with the book and it is extremely well written. Unfortunately, it was apparently lost in the mail. The shipper assured me the book was shipped, but never arrived."
2,"decent book, disappointing dominoes","I thought I'd found a good deal with the book and 112 dominos set. The book is informative and a good beginner book, but the dominos included are cheap and too small to really do anything with. Nowhere on the box or ad does it say they are not real dominos. I was disappointed."
1,How to frustrate a child,"The book of this set is extremely interesting.Then my very patient grandchild attempted to set up the dominoes. He tried for more than an hour. The dominoes are so flimsy and weightless that they simply would not stand up and always fell over by themselves. The idea is excellent, but the dominoes are so inferior it is a crime to include such very poor quality. Sell the book separately. I tried to reach the author by his email, but is was no longer available. He is probably ashamed of his product."
4,"Good video, not so good value.","There's 50 minutes of video on the disk, and of that 50, only 35 are of the Evans trio in Europe. The rest consists of a later solo recording of Evans, Evans at Newport with Eddie Gomez, and Evans participating in a four-hands jam with John Lewis, Marian McPartland and Patrice Rushan.So you don't get a lot of the early trio for your money, but then, there isn't all that much Bill Evans video out there. What you do get is a marvelous selection of the Eveans/Israels/Bunker trio that produced some of Evans' best recorded work in the 1960s after LaFaro's untimely death. The recordings all appear to be transfers from black and white European TV recordings, and the quality is about what you'd expect frmo the era, but the camera work is very good, and follows the soloists.Still, it would have been nice if the producer of this DVD had given us a bit more Evans instead of splitting what little there is between three or four expensive disks."
2,"flimsy, not much to it, but it did make my neice happy.","I'll start by saying that my neice was happy with it, despite my feelings. She loves Daphne & couldn't have been more excited. I just couldn't believe how lightweight the material was.I guess it would be fine if it's warm during halloween, where you live. We live on the east coast, and it's way too light. you need more than one layer under it, if you don't want to hide her costume with a coat.it's a different color than the photo, sort of a pink color.but as I said, she is thrilled."
2,It's true.....Its good enough for Karaoke,"For the die hard, I have got to be in this show one day, Jekkie fan, it can be a very good buy. I will admit, Don't let some of the orchestrations fool you. It's like they spent all of their money on a couple of songs (not even the ones you would expect) and then the rest of the songs are all composed on a keyboard. I dont understand this!! They do it to other musicals as well. By far the best is Phantom.....absolutely beautiful orchestrations on that Karaoke track. But Les MIs and this one which I also own seem to have really funky arrangements sometimes and odd starting places. I will say that Confrontation turned out nice as well as most of the girl numbers. This is the moment (the reason I bought this) just has a slightly odd feel to it. But, in the end, to this die hard fan I enjoy it. Just don't expect any lush orchestrations and you will enjoy it as well."
2,"Where is ""Bring on the Men""?","The two best songs in Jekyll & Hyde were ""Bring on the Men"" and ""Letting Go"". Why are they missing from this disk?"
3,"Awesome jacket, Cheap buttons","I love this jacket. My girlfriend got it for me for Christmas. Unfortunately Quicksilver decided to use shoddy buttons for the sleeves; they popped right off the first time I unbuttoned the wrists.I've tried to repair it myself, but the button is one that isn't easily fixed. It isn't the kind of button that can be sewn back on. I'm going to try to find a tailor to fix it.Other than the buttons, the jacket is great. If you're looking into buying this one, just beware of the buttons."
4,Pyrex,"Great measuring cup. Handle is a little short, so it makes it a little awkward to grip when washing. But otherwise, it's fine."
3,tipsy artwork,made in USA....hooray!....but the stencilled measurements aren't level. the only thing a measuring cup is for is accuracy. gad!
1,Piece of JUNK!!,I bought this TV based on a previous good experience with Sylvania. I quess Sylvania's QUALITY HAS GONE DOWN THE TUBE!! Wish I would have gone with a separate dvd/vcr instead of this built in one!!!! The vcr broke within 9 months with only occasional adult use and no abuse! and the dvd player is now dead and it hasn't even been a year and we maybe used the dvd 12-15 times!!!!!!!!I can only hope the tv lasts at least a few years and I can hook up another dvd/vcr player to it!! POOR quality when it breaks this fast!!! I DO NOT recommend buying this!!!!!!!!!!!!! or if you do make sure you get the extended warranty!!!!!!!!!! I for one will NEVER buy another Sylvania product!!!
3,Don't Fit Quite Right (May Require Fitting),"Got them for my S&W 66 Round Butt (which can fit into square butt grips, but not the other way around). The holes in the grips (for the grip pegs in the frame of the gun) preventing the grips from closing all the way around the gun. It looks to me like it was an oversight because there is a washer embedded in the grip that prevents the holes from being drilled any deeper. I ever so slightly filed down my grip pegs on the frame of the gun to fit the grips. They match up pretty well now."
4,Uneven Frontstrap,"I like the feel of this grip on my S&W N-Frame revolver tho the front didn't match up perfectly. One side protruded farther away from the frontstrap than the other, leaving an uncomfortable ridge. Attempts at adjustment proved fruitless. I trimmed off a little rubber on the one panel with a razor, then applied a small quantity of silicon sealant to the area, and it feels much better now."
2,not satisfied,"Pendant looks mass produced, gems look cheap and necklace is also cheap. Thought product would have been of better quality for the price."
4,A Great Improvement.,"I wrote a fairly nasty review of the original F1 2000, but this game is a vast improvement over it's predecessor. It's still kind of hard to destroy your car with one impact, but overall the damage is much more severe. Also, it's still pretty easy to win, but this version is much more believable and the competition tries harder that ever: i find it fun when two cars just ahead try to run each other off the road.I still find it annoying that you can't juggle your fuel load one or two laps either way. On the other hand, it's amazing the amount of detail in the graphics now, including being able to see all the grooves on the rain tires!On the whole, a lot of fun and the closest thing to watching real F1 racing I've found yet(on the PlayStation, at least)."
5,You need to buy this book,"I am a mother of 2 little girls and have a teaching degree. I love this book as much as my daughters do. We read ""My Jack"" at least 4 times a week and we have a lot of books to choose from. Iza Tranpani is our favorite author and illustrator. I have ordered the rest of Iza Trapani's books that we don't have, because they make Christmas gifts, gifts that last a lifetime. The rest of her books are just as good."
3,It Works,"Get ready for a workout because this edger requires a lot of it. Theirs a little sidebar or ""foot-kick"" that you can push it through the ruff stuff but its (the foot-kick) a little small and could be placed in a better spot, but it does work. I am happy with the product."
1,true value edger,"When I first started using this edger it was working great and it got the job done well. It takes some muscle but it is good exercise and you don't have to worry about gasoline or even electricity. HOWEVER, when applying pressure/muscle to the edger it eventually bent and broke. This product is not worth your money."
1,worst dvd player,"The warranty is for 90 days. After about 4 months we started having problems with it, but wasn't terrible. After one year, we are getting rid of it.Frustrating!"
1,Junk,Delivery was just fine but within 2 months the DVD stopped working then a short time later the VCR stopped working. Now know why this product is not available. Will never buy Sylvania again.
2,Keep Shopping,"If you are interested only with picken' a few tunes this book may be what you are looking for. But, if you are interested in learning about the banjo and what makes it tick consider another title."
1,Could not bring myself to finish,"I very rarely do not finish a book I start. After reading about one-third of Skipped Parts, I realized that I was avoiding my Kindle because I knew what was waiting for me; so I quit reading the book. I found all of the characters unlikable, except for the poor main character - for whom I just felt extremely sorry and sad. Stereotypes abound as a means of characterization. (Is everyone in Wyoming really a stupid hick??) I enjoy a good sex scene in a book as much as the next person, but between two twelve/thirteen year olds as the boys mother waits for them to finish. No thanks. The review for Skipped Parts said, ""Sandlin has created a lighthearted, amusing and tender story of preteen wisdom."" I must have gotten the wrong book."
2,"good writing, but strong ick factor","This is the first Sandlin book I've read. He's a good writer. His writing is funny, quirky, and intelligent. However, the subject of two 13 year olds exploring sexuality in detail - he didn't skip parts - was just too... ick. As much as I enjoy his writing style, and he is a good storyteller, I'm afraid to try another of Sandlin's books."
2,Not worth your time or money,"I bought this book after reading glowing reviews. I'm not sure what book all those other people read, but I read a book full of too much detail, too much complaining, and not enough storyline.The review quoted on the front of the book got it exactly right comparing the narrator to Holden Caulfield. That's exactly what this book is like. If you liked CITR, and his narration style, then you will probably really like this book! Just not for me."
1,awful,"I thought the language and sexual descriptions in this book were gross! Depicting 12 year olds having sex? Really? I was very disappointed, and I would definitely not purchase the other two books."
4,My heart ached for the kids,"The sadness of this book was cut by the humor that the author threw in, which is good because I found myself hurting for the kids. One kid from what seemed like a perfect family, and the other kid from a broken mother and harsh grandfather made for an interesting mix. When you discover that the ""perfect family"" is indeed justas broken as the other, which came with a literal gasp on my end, it made me think of those ""perfect families"" that I envied and drove home the point that there is no such thing as perfection.There were harsh characters and very tender ones as well. The interaction between the two was what made me appreciate the book and those same characters that are in my personal life."
5,page turn,Tim Sandlins SKIPPED PARTS will have you wanting more and will keep you turning the pages. I never wanted the book to end. The book is sad and laugh out loud funny.
1,Will Not Read It,13 yr old children being encouraged by the boy's mother to practice sex. That should be enough to turn any parent's stomach. No wonder it's being offered for free.
4,enjoyable read,"i enjoyed this book more than i thought i would...the main characters (lydia/sam) are a functioning dysfunctial family plopped into the middle of a steriotypical wholesome small town...story is centered on the sex lives of two young teens so be prepared for very descriptive parts, hence my 4 stars instead of 5"
4,Very natural,I started this book because i watched the film and i was curious about how the movie had followed the actual book. I like the naturalty that the characters face the sexual life. Somehow difficult to imagine in th real life but gives a very nice air of freedom for facing sex as just what it is.
2,Good Idea -- Feeble Execution,"On the positive side this book was sometimes amusing. The story idea of two thirteen-year-old's experimentation with sex and resulting in a pregnant seventh grader was promising though poorly executed. None of the main characters are believable, not the narrator, Sam, not his girlfriend Maurey, and not his mother Lydia. The motivations and thought patterns of the adolescents especially lacked any power to convey belief. This novel should probably have stayed in the form of Mr. Sandlin's puerile fantasies, from which it sprung."
4,a hopeful slice of black humor,"The funniest thing I've read in monthes, but if you think you live outside the asylum, and are not part of one mass craziness, it might not be for you."
1,BUY USED!!!,"I save books. I have different shelves for bathtub books, entertaining me while the husband is watching 'The Simpsons' books, cheering me up books, etc., etc. I'm very forgiving as to place, position, and costume changes. This is the very first book I've EVER thrown away. And it wasn't a saunter past the ashbin. This was a 23-footer. No net. I know the author is popular, which is why I bought her book in the first place. But I don't really understand why she's so popular. Unless there are many more devotees of really bad writing, intrusively poor grammar, lame plot lines, sloppy editing, and shallow characterization than our nation's literacy rate would indicate. Buy used, and for heaven's sake, throw it away. There's really no excuse to promote illiteracy."
3,not my fav,"I have all of Gilad's classic collection. Some dvd's he will focus on one workout far more than the other ones, such as a long high impact aerobic segment and a weak abs segment. I usually like the long ones since I get a full body workout. This one seems a bit rushed for some reason, the aerobics is so rushed he had to keep getting onto his mom about catching up. He short changes you on the floorwork especially the thighs. I have to say the abs is one of the best routines he has out there today, its very long and intense, no breaks. The cool down was about thirty seconds the shortest I have ever seen Gilad do. All in all the ab routine is worth the purchase. The best classic dvd and frankly the best dvd he has out there is the 45/45 split routine."
3,"Same formula, different surrounds","Although the workout is recommended for intermediate to advanced exercisers, I found that only 15 minutes or so really got my heart rate up. Nonetheless, the format is typical Gilad. Clear instructions, quite well rounded workout with a warm up, workout, abs and cooldown. I would recommend it to the beginner to intermediate exerciser. I might throw it into my home routine once a fortnight if I felt a bit like a less intense workout.All that said, Gilad is likeable as an instructor and he keeps you motivated."
5,A great but slightly unusual workout,"I'm a fan of Gilad's workout tapes, but this workout is a bit of a departure from his Hawaii-based tv show. First of all, it takes place in Jerusalem (Gilad is originally from Israel) and the aerobics is choreographed to a live Israeli band. There are some cheesy elements to add ""character"" to the scene like a man on a camel and a pretty Israeli girl dancing traditional dances while Gilad is doing his routine. If you don't mind that, overall, it's a strong cardio, high-impact workout composed of relatively uncomplicated moves and a substantial amount of abdominal toning. One of the highlights of Gilad's style is that he makes his show a family affair --- the older woman working out behind him and keeping up quite well with Gilad is his mother. You can see him asking her when she accidently dances in the wrong direction, ""Mommy! Where are you going?!"""
3,Typical Gilad!,"This is several different workouts from the Bodies In Motion TV show. I was hoping the workout would not be from his shows. The good thing about the DVD is there are no commercials. You do alternate from low impact to high impact aerobics which helps get your heart rate up.Overall, it was a good workout. Nothing new."
4,WCW,"The variety of weapons and wrestlers makes this game a new ruler to which future wrestling games shall be measured. Although none of the action takes place in the ring, which is a downside if you are a veteran gamer, but the backstage assault is excellent nonetheless. The versatility and graphics of the wrestlers are excellent as well as music and animations of the background. This game is perfect for you if you like fast-paced action with a lot of weapons and using your favorite wrestlers to smash the ones you hate."
1,15 year old Vet. gamer and Wrestling Fan,"I love wrestling sure, I love video games sure. But WCW: Backstage Asssault is NOT wrestling and it's hardly a video game. When EA came out with its first WCW game, WCW Mayhem, I picked it up on opening day. And a day passed and my copy was back on the store shelf. I was looking forward to backstage assault, hoping EA would correct their mistake. NOPE. again my copy is back on the store shelf. First off, I am a wrestling fan, and I love harcore matches. But no ring in the game at all? Wrestling is not just fighting backstage it requires a ring to wrestle in. The graphics run as smooth as silk, I'll give them that. But the sound? Bad. The create a wrestler was the same as mayhem with very few tweaks. Save your money and buy Smackdown 2: Know Your Role. At least thats good"
3,Not as good as Mayhem..but decent.,"Well,they gave you enough characters for sure....But who some of them are,I don't know.The NWO is gone,Raven's flock is gone..Even the Revolution isn't here.(Benoit,Saturn,Malenko).They're of course with the WWF now.(Just waiting for Raven,Tazz,and Saturn to join up.That would ROCK!) Graphics...not as good as Mayhem.Gameplay...WILD but not set up enough in a wrestling fashion.Maybe the next WCW game on the next-gen consoles will be better....like I hope WCW gets to be.No Raven?No Benoit?No Scott Hall???Yeesh!"
2,Best stick with Mayhem,"This game's Concept alone is unfortunately bad. The animations are very brutal to watch and the Moves are performed like glitches.Gameplay is just Button-mashing. WCW Mayhem is probably the best one and only best choice of the two made by EA, because the Roster was larger, Gameplay and Graphical Animations ran smoothly. Backstage Assault just doesn't capture the same feel and doesn't live up to heights that Mayhem has. This sequel lacks many great things that made Mayhem a fun game like fighting in a Wrestling Ring, a huge Variety of Moves, Graphics, and Smooth Animations. This game is just basically a step back."
3,Fun,This game has an outstanding amount of backstage areas which are all highly detailed. But it defies the actual meaning of wrestling like your ment to actually wrestle in a ring not backstage.
1,Worst game ever!!!!!!!!!!!!! WcW suks,"This game is horrible. Every thing about it is horrible. Please don't even think about buying this stupid game. The grapics, sound, gameplay is wack and is to jerky. If u want a good wcw game wait until they have one. If not get wcw mayhem. Its the best wcw out there. Try other wrestling games like wwf no mercy, wrestlemania 2000, ecw or the best wrestling right now is wwe here comes the pain."
1,"1 star, out of 100 is more like it.....","I am the little brother of a man who makes wrestling games. I have played EVERY wrestling game there is. I looked at this, and the only things I saw that could even pass this off as a wrestling game is the WCW liscense, and some of the names of the wrestlers. That ends the wrestling portion of the game. If you check, the point of the game is to fight in interactive backstage areans. It does that, and only that. While Smackdown! 2 is not based on this feature, it does what the main point of WCW Backstage Assult even better. In my opionion, do not pick this up if you are a fan of WRESTLING. Pick this up, if you enjoy what games are there for, with poorer qualitiy then expected."
5,rocket power: team rocket rescue,I think this game is one of the best.I play it all the time at my grammas .I wach the tv show all the time i only missed three shows of it.This game is cool. Thay need to make more games of this.I give this game five big stars. well i gota go see ya later.Tigershark
1,ewwwwww yuck,"If u don't like skateboarding and surfing and snowboarding do not get this game, i repeat do not get this game. I love the show but the game is awful it is sooooooooooo boaring after i tried all of the tricks i turned off my playstation and went to sleep. I wasted all my money 4 nothing,so if u don't like rocket power or sports do not get this game i REPEat DO NOT get THis game!!!!!"
1,I hate this game,This game is the worst game for kids. The graphics are horrible You can beat it in a matter of 15 minutes. My friend got it and played it and returned it in the first day!!!
1,I cant begin to tell you how bad this game is...,"Well, for starters, the cartoon is the (worst)piece of (junk) on tv. The best cartoon is south park. Second, this game is so horrible, i sold it after one hour of play. Its just too corny. If you want real skating action, go buy Tony hawks pro skater 2! Now thats a good game!"
3,Game review,"I rented this game from Blockbuster when I was around 6 years old. At the time, I though it was awesome, so I was foaming at the mouth to get my hands on this. Sadly, it hasn't aged well over the years. Choppy cut scenes, poor controls, annoying music, this isn't as great as I remembered. Still, nostalgia alone makes it something worth owning."
5,Guitar strap,Fast delivery. Great quality. Looked great. If you need one buy from these guys. No complaints whatsoever.
1,What about the extended life battery?,"I am not especially pleased with the product overall, but mainly because it won't fit with my extended life battery. It doesn't seem like it would protect the Q very well."
2,poor quality,"The casing is thick and makes it hard to push the main buttons in the middle. Overall quality is not very good. I had a different one before , it is snug and tight, this one is okay."
3,Run Really small and tight,"I ordered up a size from normal, but the shoe was still very tight. I sent it back and ordered a size up- wide. They have not yet arrived.Shoe looks well made, but since they were so tight, I never tried them for dancing."
5,Best CD I have ever owned,"I bought this CD when I was just a teenager. I was into Jars of Clay and DC Talk. Send the Beggar is five-hundred times better. Best Christian/Human band ever. Have been listening to the CD for close to eight years now, all of my copies of it are all torn to shreds, back to buy a new one."
1,UNREMARKABLE REGER,"After listening to Jean Martin's superb initial Naxos CD of assorted and sundry Reger piano music, this compilation was a disappointment. Pawlik's handling of Reger lacks the subtlety and nuance needed, especially in these pieces, which, in and of themselves, are hardly the composer's finest. >>Reger's most inspired piano works, ""From My Diary,"" Op. 82, have yet to see budget release. Jean Martin would be the perfect Naxos advocate (hint, hint).<< The sound on this Pawlik CD, as well, is rather caustic, breaking up constantly at fortes (which are also constant), and without warmth or depth."
4,Hold Review,"Hold seems to be one of the best-kept secrets for dealing with a cough. Most drug stores don't sell it and haven't heard of it. Take one before going to bed. Then read for about 20-30 minutes and take the second one. It stops the cough during the night. Just don't drink any liquids after taking it. I gave it only 4 stars because, even though the manufacturer denies it, it isn't as strong nor provide and coating of the original Hold."
4,good sound quality and noise isolation,I found this product by googling for product reviews. The reviewer claimed he could talk on this in his car with the stereo on without the party on the other end hearing the music.I drove down the highway with the stereo on and 3 windows open. The party on the other end said there was some noise in the background but they could hear me clearly. With my windows closed she said she thought I was on a landline.If it had a mute button I would give it 5 stars. great price performance
5,The Segovia Collection,"Segovia was THE MASTER of Spanish Guitar, and this collection is the perfect tribute. Others such as Manitas de Plata all followed his example."
3,"Good, but....","As a British reader I have to disagree with reviewer ""Boz"" who can imagine the real Beatles saying the dialogue in this book. The problem is that the author really does *not* capture the lads' Scouse wit at all, and in fact betrays his own American origins in some of the language he puts in their mouths (""faucet"" for ""tap"" for example).That aside, the book is fun - although now in the 2000s, rather overtaken by events. Probably one for Beatles obsessives only."
4,Hilarious,Read this when I was on a Med cruise in '85 on board the Saipan and found it an utterly hilarious look at the Beatles and the myth surrounding them as well as some of the toungue and cheek jokes that were run in it. And have been looking for another copy lately as it was a treat that I found and like to partake of it again
5,One of the funniest books I've ever read,"I bought this book in 1978 and absolutely loved it! It got misplaced & I spend years trying to track another one down; it was worth it! Just skimming through the pictures (and the hilarious captions underneath) is worth the price of admission. And the concert with Peter Frampton is hilarious. I find myself quoting this book again and again. Give us more Mark, please!"
5,Very great music by a very great artist !,"this CD, ""El comandante - meringue-jazz"", is excellent. I particularly enjoy the tenor saxophone chases between Mario Rivera, and the guess star, George Coleman. It really remember me some famous duels like Dexter Gordon and Wardell Gray, Sonny Rollins and Sonny Stitt ""Eternal Triangle"", or Tenor Madness, the unique meeting with Sonny Rollins and John Coltrane.Mario Rivera is a tenor saxophone master, but he also plays many others instruments as well. Unbeliveable ! The meeting between meringue (music of Santo Domingo, birth place of Rivera, in the Caribben), and jazz, is a very original and pleasant experience. Everyone must buy this record. Congratulation to Mr. RIVERA and all the great musicians (Hilton Ruiz on piano is fabulous on Afternoon in Paris and Have you met Miss Jones)who play on this album."
5,Excellent work by an excellent musician,"Julie Payano from Vega Baja, Puerto Rico The recording is brillant, but what could we expect from someone like Mario. No matter who he plays with, Tito Puente, Tito Rodriguez, Dizzy's United Nations Big Band or with his own group, he always gives 200% of himself. Great recording...Great artist....Don't miss this work."
5,Fact-filled and fantastic,"Henry Sakaida and Koji Takaki teamed together and put together an AMAZING book on the 343 Air Group. What is truly so incredible is that they have pulled together both sides of the story teaching us about the Japanese and their American and Allied counterparts to many of the air battles. Very useful for the WWII aviation buff or serious historian. I defer to Sakaida and Takaki on all matters regarding Japanese Naval aviation.Since 1990 I myself have personally interviewed (in their own language) 25 Japanese pilots & aviators and am preparing a book about their firsthand experiences. It won't focus on one particular unit, but will follow the aviators' experiences from the start of the war to the end. The reader will learn why they joined the Navy, their thoughts on the war, their experiences in basic training and their first combat.If you don't have this 343 Air Group book yet, do yourself a favor and order it now!"
5,One of the greatest artist there is.,It's a shame that such amazing music will only be heard by a few.
5,Genuis...,"What more can I say that hasn't alrady been said in theprevious reviews? This music is simply genius. This album is more dense, interesting , inspiring, original, creative, thought provoking,emotional, and awe-inspiring than 20 pop albums combined.Amon Tobin is without a doubt producing some of the most creative music today; unclassifiable yet containing so many familiar elements. It's just that no one has put them together quite this way before.I had taken a break from Permutation after listening to itrepeatedly for weeks, but I have started listening to it again, and it is a good as ever."
2,Intersesting...but just didn't cut it in my book.,"This is an album full of obvious hours spent mixing & recording. It pioneers new frontiers in music, but c'mon...sit up in granny's attic with your dead grandpa's jazz collection, a recorder, & a whole lot of scotch tape, & you too can bust an album like this. I give em credit, it does sound rythmically correct, but too often it feels like the album was done for the sake of doing it."
1,dissapointed,"I was browsing the Amazon.com reviews of different cd's. When I stumbled upon Permutation, I was overwhelmed with the response from different people.Me being a jazz and hip hop lover, I thought this album would have those flavors.Sorry to say I was gravely dissapointed. The music is too .. hmmm.. its just plain wierd. It was very hard to enjoy. Maybe its not my type of music, maybe its too ""new"" for me. I'm a very open-minded person, when it comes to music. But, this CD just didn't click."
4,VERY strong and fresh mix of influences,"Some artists wear their influences on their sleeves, apparent and blase. Tobin pulls from the bottom of the crates and bargain bins and blends them in a fresh, dynamic way, and on no record more clearly than this one. The occassional drum-and-bass touches are smoothed out here, and the whole record has a laid-back but un-soft vibe.Not a purely downtempo record, not a purely drum-and-bass record, but a smashing great middle-ground. Not for the casual listener (more in the vein of, say, some really groovy Autechre or DJ Shadow, not quite a Kid Koala bender), but a must-have for anyone who's been into electronic music for the past few years."
4,Good CD,"When I ordered this CD, I thought that all of the songs would have the same vibe as the very last song. They do not. The last song is the best song on the CD, but the CD in all is pretty good. I suggest that prospective customers preview the CD, if they can, before they buy."
3,Seriously?,"@dictator95:""Don't buy this book (because that shows you miss the concept) but click here to read it online""?!You see the irony in that lol ..."
4,"Does NOT fit All Clad 14"" Stir Fry Pan!","I purchased this item based upon a reviewer's comment that it fits the All Clad 14"" Stir Fry Pan. IT DOES NOT fit this pan! The cover has a steel ring running around the circumference of the lid which has a lip with a 90 degree bend in it (downward). The diameter of this lip is EXACTLY 14"", and not 14 1/4"". The lip is designed to fit down INTO the inner diameter of a 14"" pan. As such, this glass cover does NOT fit the All-Clad 14"" Stir Fry Pan... as the pan has a flat edge at the outer perimeter, and does not mate with the Scanpan Classic Glass Cover. Amazon... please clarify the dimensions!Otherwise, (although a little expensive) this pan appears to be of very good build quality. I would have been happy to keep it if it would have fit my intended purpose."
3,"Does not fit a 14.25"" fry pan","It is a nice lid, but does not fit a frying pan of the same size. if it did, i would have given it a 5."
4,Fits my 14 inch pan well,"Works great with my 14 inch Scanpan. Easy to clean by hand so I haven't put it in the dishwasher. The black plastic handle does not come attached and must be screwed onto the lid. It does collect a small amount of water under the handle after being washed and rinsed; and it is a bit heavy. Overall, I'm very pleased with this purchase."
1,The lifetime warranty is false advertising. It is a lie,"After contacting Scanpan regarding a broken lid, I received an email from Scanpan sating that the lid is NOT covered by warranty. Note also that some incompetents and Amazon blocked my first attempt to post this review I assume because I posted the actual email from ScanpanThe lifetime warranty is FALSE ADVERTISING"
1,It broke into pieces just after two minutes after the knob was fixed.,The package came fine and in time. But just two minutes after fixing the knob it broke into pieces all by itself.
5,Amazing,This cd is their best ever done to me. All tracks are just great They are very good performers of all times. They are together since 1969 and are still very popular in Germany. Too bad they don't sign in English 'cause I'm sure they would have been very very popular in North America. I'm a fan since 1989 and listen to their music mostly every day. Great buy even if it's in german. The music is so excellent that I don't mind that the lyrics are in german.
4,Complete Medical Microbiology Review Book..,"'Medical Microbiology and Immunology: Examination and Board review' is more than a good book. The organization and contents of the book are great. Summaries of the most important microorganisms at the end of each section of the book make it excellent for quick reviewing what one has just read. Also, the book includes unique chapters like normal flora, laboratory diagnosis, and vaccines which are really helpful. The immunology section extensively provide a solit understanding of the immune mechanisms, using illustrative figures and mnemonics. Moreover, the MCQs at the end of the book, along with the clinical cases, emphasize on the important areas in medical microbiology.One more thing I have to complement is the use of bold font in the book; this made skimming chapters quickly before a final microbiology exam a 'stressless' event, and gave confidence.To be neutral in my review, the book lacks a good mycology section (You need another book for mycology)."
2,Not really updated for 2006,"I was disappointed to find this was really a 2005 book with a 2006 cover. While I found much of what I needed to know, I had to visit the IRS website for current 2006 limits on depreciation."
3,Great Potential,"This is a marvelous performance whose virtues are diminished by the technical shortcomings of the disk. I have this same recording on an old vinyl dbx disk that allows me to hear the performance with more life-like dynamics. The praise that this performance receives is justly deserved. Hopefully, it will be remastered for SACD or another hi-rez / high dynamic range format one day. Until then, you may settle for this CD or find a vinyl disk."
1,Blue Screen of Death Alert,"Installation went smoothly, but upon trial use of MacOpener (I have old digicam files I wanted to access) my PC went into blue screen mode when I inserted the first Mac CD. After spending an hour I recovered and used XP's System Restore to return to normal. I immediately removed Conversions Plus from my HD. I wouldn't recommend Conversion's Plus unless you get an adrenalin rush from system failures. The DataViz site admits to conflicts with other software, but I don't have the time to uninstall and check all of my applications and drivers against an app that I needed for occasional use of one element. Opened software is unreturnable unless you wish a duplicate of the same, so I'll eat the cost and chalk it up to experience. I'll have to find another solution to my problem, as Conversions Plus is not the answer for me."
5,Classic Luther,"Classic Luther. A must have for your collection. I miss his velvet voice, especially on ""A house is not a home""."
4,high road guide to north carolina mountains,great- excellent information in an easy to use and understand format- highly recommend to anyone with an interest in oldest mountains on earth or just in visiting western north carolina.
2,"Too much philosophy, too little biography.","This was a short book, for which I'm grateful. It would have been much more enjoyable if it was half as long. The aspects of going blind and than regaining sight many years later was intriguing, and those parts of the book I enjoyed. But the author spent (IMHO) much to much time talking like a philosopher, which made it an effort to read."
3,3 1/2 good string quartet recordings,"This is generally a fine recording. I enjoy the recording of the 3rd quartet particularly. First movement is more leisurely than the LaSalle Quartet's recording but otherwise just fine.But what a horrible crime the engineers have committed in the 2nd Quartet! The last two movements can be agonizingly beautiful. Not here. When the soprano makes her entrance, they hush the quartet -- as if they had dropped a cloth over it. Then when her part is finished (measure 116 of the fourth movement), up comes the cloth and the full sound of the strings is restored (mm 117-156). Same thing happens in the 3rd movement. Was this in Evelyn Lear's contract? It certainly turns a lot of good music to fuzz.Happily there are a number of recordings of the 2nd all by itself. (You can even have the string orchestra performance by I Musici de Montreal on Chandos.) So if you need recordings of the less recorded 3rd and 4th, this might be a fine choice."
5,The Opposite Pole from LaSalle,"I can only echo the very perceptive comments here that these readings have a Brahmsian aspect or more broadly something very Viennese, even to the point of ""mit schlag"". I have always loved and identified with the LaSalle Quartet's interpretations of these great works. To the point that I somehow avoided hearing these recordings till recently, even though I love Evelyn Lear' s art. Indeed, these interpretations might be helpfully acknowledged as the opposite pole from the LaSalle's. They are so different that it took me a few hearings to adjust my ears. But what exquisite readings they are. And Evelyn Lear is just heartbreaking in the the Second Quartet. Also, I very much agree with the previous reviewer who noted that the performance of the Third Quartet is especially revelatory. It is the most persuasive reading I have ever heard."
3,Automatic shutoff definition unclear,What was appreciated about my previous electric teakettle was that the automatic shut-off shut off when the water reached the proper temperature. This tea kettle only shuts off when the water has totally evaporated.
4,Great for a while,"I've had two of these kettles and like the design, the whistle, and the quickness with which it heats. However, both kettles eventually began to leak after a couple of years. If you buy one, I suggest making sure you pour out any remaining water once you've used it, and don't accidentally overfill. I am not sure which caused my leakage, but I'm buying another electric kettle of a different brand this time. Still for the price, I've been very happy with this kettle. It's lasted a long time, and I can afford to replace it when it's worn out."
3,on/off,"It's a great little kettle, but unfortunately there is no on/off switch. It boils quickly and never bubbles over, but I don't like having to unplug it to turn it off."
3,Takes longer to heat less water,"I had an electric tea kettle for 10 years that I loved. This kettle has two things that I really like that it didn't have: a whistle and it stays cool to the touch. However, it takes longer to heat than the one I previously had and yet holds less water. I am a little disappointed in its efficiency."
1,pitiful amenic whistle,"This kettle does boil water, but the whistle is weak and puny.I bought it because the earlier version was quite nice. This one isn't.I've asked WestBend for information to make it louder (perhaps I received a flawed unit). If they don't answer this is going straight to the dustbin.Don't waste your money or your time."
2,Do you trust plastics?,"This tea kettle works fine for what it is-- a plastic tea kettle. The water is actually heated in a plastic container, and you can smell the plastic in the steam coming off-- at least for the first dozen fillings, which is all I have tried. Given the many known and unknown health effects of compounds coming from plastics, do you really want to drink the water that it heats?"
2,It does the job,"I have a T-Fal Vitesse that I use at the office and I love it. The top opens up the entire kettle and it boils water in less than a minute. I bought the West Bend to use at home. I chose it because it is smaller and less expensive than the T-Fal. There are 2 drawbacks that were unanticipated and not advertised. It takes more than 2 minutes to boil a mug of water, and it doesn't open up for cleaning or filling. We use filtered water so we have to get out a funnel to get the water into the kettle without spilling all over the counter. Other than that, it boils the water just fine--if you have the time. It's best to used distilled water so you won't get mineral buildup that you can't clean easily."
3,OK Tea Kettle,"We needed an electric tea kettle and i went for the one that didn't cost too much and, for the price, this is an OK tea kettle. Wish the cord was longer...It does what you want--it heats water and whistles when the water is ready!!"
5,Has been a trusted companion for YEARS,"I've had this electric kettle for nearly 15 years. I don't even know if mine has an auto-shutoff, but it has faithfully heated my water quickly without issues for longer than expected of most appliances out there. The only annoying feature is the cord is attached to the kettle, but when mine was purchased, every kettle was that way. As for cleaning it, you just heat a vinegar/water solution in it. I have to admit that mine was a gift, and even though it has an annoying cord and no longer matches my current stainless steel kitchen, I'm loathe to part with it. I'm curious just how many more good years it'll give me."
3,Lightning doesn't strike twice,"Ask Me Now is a masterpiece. This CD is OK. The concepts are the same. Put Pee Wee into a challenging Chamber Jazz context, stretch him with exposure to some brilliant Modern Jazz compositions, give him a couple of ballads to do his thing. Marshal Brown really doesn't swing on that valve trombone - I guess he doesn't swing on the other CD either but it isn't so jarring. His phrasing is so literal that it sounds like he's reading his solos. Pee Wee has great moments (Taps Miller, for example) but if you need to make a choice...Ask Me Now wins hands down. This CD feels more like a bunch of Jazz traditionalists trying to make a Jimmy Giuffre record."
5,greatest NES game of all time! (but don't buy bb stars 2),"if u have a nes, and u don't own this game, u should be shot! if u like baseball, and u don't have a nes, then buy 1 JUST 4 THIS GAME! i bought a yobo recently, and it works pretty good for the cheap price. it is the best nes game of all time. i still play it all the time, and it's 2008. the game is like 20 years old, but still a blast. DON'T BUY BASEBALL STARS 2, AS IT DON'T COMPARE TO THIS 1. u can read my review of that one 4 greater detail."
4,Vanhal: Symphonies Vol.1,Vanhal: Symphonies Vol.1 is a recording under the direction Uwe Grodd who leads the Nicolaus Esterháazy Sinfonia on this Naxos recording from 1998. Paul Bryan has written very informative and well-written linernotes. The booklet also contains short biographies of the conductor. One can clearly hear that he was influenced by both Mozart as well as Handel. Recommended. 4/5.
1,Won't boil,"I wish that I had opted for the 1000-watt Proctor-Silex Fifth Burner that cost the same amount as this 750-watt powerless piece of junk. I bought it specifically to boil water with, and it heats the water to within 10 degrees of boiling and then cycles off. I watched and waited for 90 minutes with my thermometer and 3 quarts of water to see if it would ever boil, and it never did. I tried it with a much smaller quantity of water (24 ounces), and it would only simmer intermittently. Soggy, ruined noodles every time. Useless for me, may be good if all you want it for is melting butter."
1,defective but fast refund,"Product was defective, but despite my delay in returning the hotplate, a refund was quickly issued. They even called to apologize. Great customer service! I would definitely buy from them again."
2,"Okay at first, then downhill.","It worked pretty well in the beginning. Now it's impossible to regulate the temperature. Even on the low setting, it's very hot. Have been using for 8 or 10 months, and not every day."
4,"Solid, no-frills burner","Nice, compact, simple design stores easily. Heats up and cools down promptly. Very happy with this item."
1,shocked me within a week,"These last a long, long time. In fact, once they land in a dump, you can expect them to last a hundred years or more.I bought one from this company, almost identical to this one. It started shocking me within a week or two."
1,"I cannot rate this item, but can rate Amazon","I ordered it on 9/9. At the beginning it would come middle of October. It was OK. However, delivery schedule had been changed. It is not arrived yet, nor I do not know when it will come.Amazon knows this delay. However, they asked me to send a review of it. What does it mean?I rated this item as 1-star; it is not for the item, but for the seller, Amason. Amazon is generally good campany, I think. However, I cannot accept my situation for this. Honestly saying, I want to rate 0-star for this order."
5,Healed of Cancer,This book is a true inspiration! It will lift up your spirits and renew your faith.
5,Take Your Future Into Your OWN Hands!,"Mrs Osteen does a wonderful job showing the reader how to keep your chin up even in the worst of times. Giving us views and glimpses into her own heart of steel, Dodi Osteen shows the reader the true power of applying God's word to not only your health, but your daily life as well. A Must read!"
1,"Well intended,perhaps, but a remarkably inane book.","I am a Christian and I have cancer (leukemia). I'm not healed in body and probably never will be (read incurable). I found this book at the Cleveland Clinic Taussig Cancer Center, and found it to be insulting. Prayer has saved me, but it won't save my body. This tripe would have you believe that if you pray hard enough and in the ""right"" way that you would be healed just like Dodie. Bless her I'm glad she's healed. But what about all of the devout Christians who die? We all die, you know. Dodie will just die richer from your money if you buy this book."
4,Good Quality,"Uno for computer seems like a pretty good game. I have played it a bit and had fun however this was a present for my mother who is not really into computers. As it was, my mother has enjoyed the game alot and she spends alot of time playing it. Having the manual is also good as there are new cards exclusive to this version of Uno that my mother did not know how to use. The person who built hte computer for her put on a cracked version that came without a manual :(Anyway, great product. Well worth playing but the price is way to much. People are only charging that much because they can get away with it and they won't re-release it."
3,Great game,"I bought this game used about a year ago.....when they were trying to sell it new for over $80.00. I agree with the writter that wrote in that this game is overpriced, and like he said.....it is because they can get away with it. I don't like the way the cards jump around before they hit the pile for the next player to finally get the chance to go (takes to long).....so due to that I love to play the single player mode. I love how dramatic they have the cards react when you win/loss a game. Cute!!! I would recommend this game to anybody who loves uno like I do."
3,Uno,"I am a lover of Uno. So when I found a used copy of Uno I was excited. It's not a cheap computer game. I have been looking for a copy for a long time, but could not find one. I was overjoyed when I found this copy. But it didn't work out well. Due to the fact that the disc had a number of scratches on it, this prevented it from playing correctly, (sometimes that happens when you buy used items). I had to return it. Nevertheless, the seller apologized and refunded my money in about two days without argument or conflict. Although I could not keep the game, the service the seller provided was great, I received the game three to four days after I ordered it and got my money back in about 48 hours after the seller received the disc. In the future I will do business with this dealer again.Dr. Cindi M. Brady"
3,Hoped it would be better.,Although it contained a great deal of detail I found it to be repetitive. Good read though.
1,Don't bother,"The publisher took a generic book on small businesses, threw in the odd coffee & tea reference, slapped on a cover with a coffee cup and viola! a new marketing niche... No specific tea information is included at all. Even the standard business info is done better in other books- save your money and buy one of those."
2,Less than meets the eye.,I cannot in truth reccomend this title to anyone else. The vast majority of the book is standard small business / resturant material. Only a very tiny portion is devoted to Tea specific material. (And that portion is not very useful to anyone who knows Tea.)
2,Okay for a general book,"This book was good in the general starting a business vein. However, it really does not deal in real depth with the actual coffee/tea business. A bit of a disappointment."
2,"It's not awful, but...","I don't disagree with the negative reviews this book's gotten, but I think it needs elaboration. If you've never run (or started) a small business before, this is an -okay- intro to various concepts you'll need. Better has been published since 1994, & there's almost no depth. To add insult, of the 243 pages only 60 really have anything to do with starting a coffee/tea retail operation. If you're thinking of getting this, save your money & read _Start & Run a Coffee Bar_ (Matzen & Harrison), which makes an effort to actually address vital stuff like sanitation & how to make a decent espresso."
5,A touching account of our relationship with Man's best friend.,"Soul Friends is an emotional account of finding your special 'Soul Friend'. Our relationships with our dogs can comfort us when we need companionship and unquestioning loyalty the most. This special bond works both ways. Kate Nicholl provides guidance for those who want to rescue a dog or get a puppy. How do we decide what type of dog to adopt? Are we ready to dedicate the time and resources necessary to take care of a dog? Rescuing a dog may mean that dog needs special attention, an inordinate amount of patience, and an overwhelming amount of love. It takes time to build that special relationship with your soul friend. You should read this book to help you find yours."
5,Don't miss this,"No-one with the slightest interest in Chopin should miss Idil Birets recordings of his complete works. There are a few minor disappointments (notably the Waltzes and the Concertos), but most of these interpretations rank with the finest available, and Biret plays with a freshness of approach that sheds new light on this wonderful music. Even those who think they live happily with Pollini, Ashkenazy etc., should check this out. You might be surprised! The piano-sound is slightly to the bright and thin side, but enjoyable enough."
3,"It's ok, but it's not great after you've heard Rubinstein.","These would not be my first choice for Chopin. I'd go with Rubinstein or Ashkenazy before choosing this one. I think some of it has to do with the harsh piano sound. It doesn't suit Chopin's music, but that is not necessarily Biret's fault. I'd like to see a pianist do a modern recording of Chopin's music in analogue on vinyl. I love the warm (sometimes crackly) sound of vinyl. It makes me smile. These recordings are completely opposite. They don't feel very personal or warm at all."
3,Dave before he was Dave,"Well, if you're a Dave Grusin fan, go ahead and order-- it's almost embarrasing at times, and certainly illustrates the incredible journey of practice, study and patience that led to the legend he has become. This will give you hope, proof that the important thing is to begin the journey, and then work your butt off."
4,"Early Pleasant River Families of Washington County, Maine","A great book- long overdue!! Pretty factual although there are errors as with any genealogy book. Do think the authors should have double checked when possible with family members on their own genealogy a bit better than they did.As for info, there is so much between the pages that it is well worth the price.A good book for the genealogist looking for his early ancesters thought to be from Pleasant River!!Can't wait for the next book now underway!!Marilyn Drisko Worcester"
3,Could have been a LOT better,"I was expecting more from this book, which I bought for my three-year old ring bearer. The main character is semi-annoying, and the book isn't very interesting. It does give the basics of what goes on at and before a wedding, but I didn't think it explained very much very well, and I didn't think the writing was particularly good, either. And, the main character's name is ""Bobby,"" which seemed annoyingly ""typical-kid's-book-character-name."""
2,"Tedious for the adult reader, but somehow popular with the kid","I hate to rain on the Ring Bearer's big parade, but this book was a disappointement. The writing was at the high school level, with illustrations apparently done by a middle schooler. The book follows ""Bobby"", who has been invited to be the ring bearer in his uncle's wedding. The plot is heavy on Bobby's misadventures with falling out of trees and running around with his shoes untied, and light on the actual responsibilities of a ring bearer. Our four year-old has admittedly liked the book, however, and we've read it to him often. I think he'll be prepared to be a ring bearer, but probably not better prepared than if we had just sat him down and talked him through it."
3,"Not what I expected, but it will do","My 4-year-old nephew is going to stand up as the ring bearer in my October wedding. I thought a book about it would be perfect, but was disappointed that the selection of titles was lacking. This seemed to be the best choice with mixed reviews. Overall, I like the book and my nephew, I think, loves it and understands his role a little better. I found it helpful to change the names so it would apply more to him, which made for a little tongue-tying! I do think the book could be a little shorter, but overall, like I said, it will do."
2,Neil Does It Again!,"I was hesitant about buying this CD after hearing Up On The Roof and the Movie CD. Neil has come back to himself with this one. This CD is purely Neil Diamond as we know him. He has written the lyrics and music to every song on the CD. Every song is a gem. If Neil is left to himself to write a CD without any outside influences, he really comes through. This CD is a must for all die hard Neil Diamond fans. It's great to have him back!"
2,Two Chords Short,"Being a fan of Neils music for years, I am extremely disappointed by his latest effort. Being open minded I feel that it is an evolution of an artist and not neccessarily a weak effort on the part of Neil.Who can forget the hard driving ""Hot August Night"" era and the simplistic yet captivating ""Moods""? His music has evolved over the years, just not so drastically. Most of the songs on his latest production are repetitive in nature from a musicians perspective.With that said, my respect for the ""master"" is still intact and I'm looking forward to his performance in Dayton, OH in November. I sure hope to hear some of his old classics. (Neil, are you listening?)Regardless of mine or anyone elses personal likes or dislikes in Neils recent shift in style, the man still puts on one hell of a show."
1,Wait for a sale before buying,"What happen,after Neil put out a great collection of songs on his last CD this one is a disappointment.Great for listening to before going to bed especcially if you have insomia,this cd works better than sleeping pills"
4,Another excellent offering from Mr. Diamond,"Neil Diamond has produced another glittering, sparkling gem. He's not getting older; he's getting better! His voice is just as catching as when I first heard it as a young teenager. His talent to compose is amazing. The orchestration on this CD is awesome, especially the steel drums during ""Your Are The Best Part of Me."" Don't hesitate to buy and play this CD till you drive others crazy! I anxiously await his concert in October!"
4,new songs,"This is a great CD new songs, but I really didn't appreciate it till I saw him perform some of them live. In concert last week-what a concert! After seeing him do these songs in person-its my favorite CD yet-hope for many more. If you have a chance to see his 2002 tour-3 Chord Opera - go--you will need this CD to add to your collection!"
5,Perfection...,"I would highly recommend this newest work by Mr. Diamond. I thought the songs were great the first time, and it keeps getting better every time I listen to it! This is the first album since Serenade where he has written each and every song himself, and he's still got that touch, from the beautifully mournful ""I Haven't Played This Song In Years"" to the bouncy upbeat ""At The Movies"" and right down to the sweetly personal ""Elijah's Song."" Neil is once again at his best here."
5,Neil is back,"Apparently writing songs via other people's standards has not dulled his ability to write a true Neil Diamond song. Bravo. This CD is definately proof positive that there is still music being made out there that can be listened to over and over without getting tired of it. There are songs that are catchy, a couple maudlin and introspective, but Neil, the real Neil is back. Who says you can't make great music past 50?? From this CD, I'm thinking Neil will be doing it for a long time. Lucky us!! :-)"
4,as good as ever,have been a great neil diamond fan since intrduced by my older brother in law in the sixties have seen him four times live one of the best live acts ever all his music has been excellent he should get more acclaim than he does one of our greatest singer song writers ever buy his music and find out hope to see him again soon would love to see him in concert in america
5,Baby you still got it,I have been a fan of Neil Diamond for over 30 years and as he music has changed with the times and has grown to a Grandpa.. well this Nana is still hot for Neil Diamond keep up the music Neil you keep the rest of us young as we were in that WELL AS A HOT AUGUST NIGHT.....
1,NOT A REAL DIAMOND...A CUBIC ZIRCONIUM,"I hate to do this but this is an embaressingly bad cd.Go back and listen to BEAUTIFUL NOISE,THE JAZZ SINGER,I'M GLAD YOU""RE HERE WITH ME TONIGHT ,even TENESSEE MOON had moments that were Diamonds' if there weren't so much hype about this no one would listen to it"
5,A rare World War II stamp spurs murder and terror today,"I was caught up immediately in Mike Slosberg's world of murder, treachery, and rare unusual stamps. Remember the Curtiss Jenny stamps where the plane is upside down and each stamp now sells for hundreds of thousands of dollars? Well, the rare stamp in this thriller shows Hitler's head inverted, and it's the only one like it that exists. When word that this ""invert"" is available get posted on the Internet, the world's stamp collectors clamor for it. But a former Nazi officer has a much more ""useful"" need for this long-missing stamp and will pay far more than the highest bid. The action gets furious and the murders start to happen one by one. The ending is a twist that will catch you totally by surprise. Don't wait for the movie -- read this book now!"
1,The Hitler Error,The Hitler Error Is enjoyable easy reading. Interesting plot. Will keep you guessing. If you have an evening and don't want to watch TV read this book. I think you will find it fun
4,Viva Henry.,"This is an excellent sports game, with great graphics even in Classic Playstation format. Computer opponents, even at their highest level, often end up in free-for-all, less than realistic scoring barrages- but its still fun.Head-head play is fantastic."
2,Invincible Goalkeepers?,"The graphics didn't seem that much better than other Fifa games, and sometimes the players themselves don't know where the ball is. The goalkeepers are the greatest, all of them. To a certain point it gets annoying, they save every shot! Rent this game before you go out and buy it, and see if you like or not."
4,FIFA 2001-A Good Game,"OK Let me get started. First of all it don't have all the hair styles that the version for PS2 and PC have, also you can't set the stadium you want to play in like PS2 and PC, but it has more weather conditions than the PS2 and PC have (which I like) and you can play in the ""Dusk"" time of day, which you can't in PS2 and PC (I like that too). And you can't set the weather and time of day at ""Random"" which PS2 and PC can (that don't matter to me much). So that's my review, I think it's a ""4 Star"" game. It's OK. Thanks for hearing me out. C ya!"
1,Paid for 2 sets sent both back got credited for one,This product was very flimsy ...it was also a refurbed ..meaning sent back and resold ...some of the forks were bent in the front display even before I took them out of the box ..poor quality ...was looking for a heavier set ...and where is my other credit i never recieved ? ....
2,Cheap! Oh yeah!,Farberware is cheap junk. Everything Farberware makes is cheap junk. Some people like cheap junk so if you are one of them then this is pretty good cheap junk.
3,cheap but worth 9$,"I didnt expect much from this set, but it looks okay compare to other set I bought (same price), the look is cheap but not design is okay,it's definately not 100$, but for 9$, it's worth using, even for 1 time- as people said, it's good for outdoor usage, but not for other purposes"
3,You get what you pay for.,"We were in a crunch for flatware so ordered this during a ""gold Box"" sale. They were fine, but very flimsy. We have since replaced them with a sturdier set, but they served the purpose while we were looking for what we really wanted."
2,Very Basic Flatware,"I ordered this from the Gold Box for $19.99. Because of the Farberware brandname and the MSRP of $100., I was more hopeful than I should have been. In retrospect, I think it's fair to say that Farberware does cookware much better than they do flatware. This is a very basic set, without a lot of esthetic appeal. It would be a big improvement over thrift store mis-matched knives and forks; it's probably on a par with the less expensive Walmart stainless steel flatware, although these are very lightweight. These spoons and forks really bend easily.If you are currently hording those plastic-wrapped knives, forks and spoons they have at the fast food chains and saving them to use when you get home for dinner, this is a giant step in the right direction.Otherwise, I think spending $10. more at a Big Box store, will buy you something much nicer."
2,Easily bent,"I liked the simple design of the flatware, but found out that it is easily bent. I would not purchase it again."
1,Thought it would be a great deal.....,"It was advertised as a markdown from $99 to $20 and thought it would be a great savings. Turned out to be very cheap and light weight. In fairness, Amazon has sent a return mailing label and I need to send it back and will do so. I usually buy movies, books and music. This purchase was the only one I've been dissatisfied with."
2,ok but cheesy silverware,"I bought two sets at 19.99 each on gold box purchase, so did I expect really great quality? Well I did, because they listed it at 100.00 regular price. It is acceptable for everyday use but it really is thin and kind of uncomfortable to hold. But if you are looking for an average set at a really good price this will do it for you."
5,Great cd,"Nu Flavor's 2nd cd ""It's on"" is filled with great music. From slow ballads to fast up-tempo songs, this cd will keep you coming back for more. Some of my favorites are ""Love Fantasy"", ""Promise"" and ""From this day"". The whole cd is great though..Definately worth a listen :)"
4,"Awesome, awesome awesome","I was skeptical when i first bought this cd from this website, but after listening to it, I was glad I decided to purchase it. Songs 2-8 are awesome. The last song on the track is really different from their usual style, but I guess its alright.. 3 Little Words is perfect if you're into slowjams, as well as The Most Beautiful Girl. Their voices are so relaxing to listen to, and the style of their music is different from most music artists. 3 little words: buy, buy, buy.. hehe hope that helps u guys in making ur decision! =oP"
5,WOW AMAZING INCREDIBLE,I LUV EVERYTHING ABOUT THESE GUYS THEY MAKE GREAT MUSIC I LUV ALL OF THE SONG THIS IS A GOOD LUV CD I LUV IT ITZ GREAT ITS JUST WOW!!!!
5,Gramma's Cure All,My Grandmother had a couple of small bottles of Numotizine Cataplasm. It cured practically everything you put it on. I had always thought it was something she had thrown together in her kitchen. I'm sooo glad I can get more now that I know what it is.
1,Gave Up after 4 Units,"I've tried 4 different units (3 sent free by the manufacturer after my original purchase). All worked fine at first, but then the sprayer and/or the ultrasound device on the wand stopped working. They were kind enough to give me a full refund after the fourth one failed."
5,A re write of previous rating,"Fair is Fair, as they say, and I had previously given this product a bad rating due to my hearing loss and impatience.Because I couldn't hear a buzz when I set it to cotton, I assumed I had a unit that was defective. My wife told me to hold it close to my ear. After finally hearing it, I followed the dirctions and removed several bad stains for the most part including ink stains in my shirt pocket. It helped to give the stains a shot of Shout afterwards before washing. Most stains completely disappeared.As consumers reports suggested,it is just as effective with a white cotton cloth under the stain when applying the electronic wand with solution.I also found it to be more effective if I did not let the stain dry out and used the wand as soon as possible. In my opinion...with patient application as instructed...this product is definitely worth it's price"
1,JUNK - not worth the money,"This is really a money making machine, it is not for getting stains out of anything.I spent 20 minutes trying to get a small stain out, it faded a little, I used two of the pads in the process and I still have a stain.Rather use something else, a little elbow grease perhaps - that would work much better!SAVE YOUR MONEY."
1,Worthless,"Just bought unit today and it quit on second stain. Did fade 1st stain, but then the wand quit. Finally got through on their customer service line and was told no troubleshooting available; take it back to the store for an exchange. Could not get info about this product on either Black and Decker or Tide's website."
2,"Worked, then quit","This worked well when we first started using it. Tried it again after awhile, and the tube is clogged. Can't fix it - it needs a slotted-screwdriver (not a torx as another comment mentioned). Since the utrasound still works, we'll still use it."
1,Save your money,I purchased this stain remover with great excitement. When it arrived our housekeeper could not wait to use it as she loves laundry. It does not remove stains as well as the inexpensive stain remover you buy in the grocery store.I called customer service at Black and Decker and what a nightmare. In order to send it back you must send in the cord with $5.00 (can you believe that??) and you will not get a refund but just another one of the Stain Busters. They also wanted my credit card number...unbelievable.I hope to hear from someone who has used it successfully and maybe this one is faulty.
5,A Different Kind Of Elfman,"First of all, this CD is rather different from previous Elfman/Burton projects. It is very loud, percussive, bombastic, and clangy. Second of all, this CD takes the loud, bombastic tracks, and mixes them with Elfman's original fun style.The result is an extremely creative and fun CD to listen to. It is dark and loud sometimes, but mixed with Elfman's manic style, this CD is the one of the most unique soundtracks of all time."
2,Boring; fails to stand on its own.,"This soundtrack just simply didn't impress me. While I enjoyed the film, and the music playing while I watched the film, the score fails miserably to stand alone. The music needs the visuals, and without picture, it is plain -dull-. The potential for a great soundtrack was there... great creativity and execution, it's very unique to begin with, but after the third or fourth track, I found myself bored. It felt like I was listening to the same dozen notes played exactly the same way over and over again. The music is s-l-o-w, and aside from a few exceptions, it has absolutely no emotion or driving force behind it. It's just -there-.On the plus side, the last track, ""Rule the Planet Remix"" is wonderful. In fact, it's probably the only selection on the whole CD I find myself listening to anymore.I would not recommend this CD to a casual fan of the movie; only those who ""went ape"" over ""Apes"" should sink money into this album. :)"
4,Grape Ape!,"""Rule the Planet Remix"" is reason enough to own this one! I heard this during the end credits and had to have it. I am not dissappointed. Plenty of heartpounding percussion. Crank up the bass on this one. Very good to listen to with a subwoofer."
3,Good but not the best.,Not the best Elfman score but the last track is simply stunning and shows a sample of the future of techno music in films. Way to go Paul.
3,Meh....,"Nice Elfman here... not quite upto par with some of his other stuff (e.g. Batman), but he does a decent job carrying this one, though I can't help wishing that Jerry Goldsmith had done this score. Can't wait for the movie to come out!"
4,Nice & Beaty,"This sounds like nothing else I've run across on this continent. Not that I've heard anything on another continent. Don't get out much. But this makes me want to. The techno track is dope as hell too. So quit reading this, you damn dirty human...and go buy it. You won't regret the movement it'll put in your primordial soul."
4,Nice afternoon of watching,"The title for this DVD is correct. It is shows from the original Rick Steves travels in Europe. A great show on PBS. For those who have bought DVD's of Rick Steves in the past, you may end up getting some doubles here. One reason I gave a rating of 4 stars.Disk one has some new episodes which where only seen on tv and vhs before. Sweden, Finland, Denmark, and Norway episodes are now on DVD. Wish personaly they would do more Scandanavia other than quick 24 minute shows on the capitols. There is also added side trips France and England and the original Alps episodes for France, Austria, Switzerland, and Italy not seen yet on DVD. Very worth the viewing.Disk two has been produced twice now on DVD. This is basically the Greece, Turkey, Israel, Egypt DVD all over again. Nothing really new. But still worth a look if you have not seen them before.With the episodes from 2000 and up being produced on one huge DVD, these are a nice added collection to have."
3,"Seiji Ozawa must mean ""chief blunderer"" in Japanese.","Norman, McCracken, and Troyanos are all incredible singers. The orchestra and the choir played and sang respectably, but in this work they were in serious need of some direction, and they obviously didn't get enough. With simpler music, a rotten conductor can get away with murder, but with something as large and challenging as Gurrelieder, shabby conducting leads to volume imbalances so large that several melodic lines get drowned out and tempos so brisk that the handful of players that can still be heard end up skipping and slurring many notes.To prove my point, listen to one of the more complex numbers on this one like ""Gegrusst, o Konig"" or ""Seht die Sonne"" and then listen to the same section conducted by a real conductor like Boulez, Chailly, Sinopoli, or Rattle. I guarantee you it will be a night and day difference. Luckily, Ozawa managed to keep it somewhat together while Norman and McCracken were singing, so it's not a total loss."
5,Amazing overview of Spanish!,"Quick Start Spanish is one of the best tools I've found for effective language learning (and I've been teaching Spanish for 30 years!). It is well organized, accurate, light, funny, and a delight to use. At Expanded Learning we use Quick Start with all our beginning students. Here is a comment from a typical student: ""I loved the book! It made learning exciting and non-threatening. Since I was able to see the whole picture right away, I had the confidence to jump in, start speaking, and also the motivation to continue learning. Muchas gracias!""In addition to taking the mystique out of learning Spanish, we've found Quick Start to be effective as a preparation to studying, as a review, and as a handy reference. As a bonus, it offers tips for effective learning in general, very helpful to all learners and students."
5,Get crazy with it!,"This product is great especially if you get crazy with it. In other words, you will have more fun and learn more and retain more Spanish if you do the exercises as outlined. I hope this doesn't sound strict...but this way of teaching is excellent! You get creative - and remember the lesson! You get to shout and to pretend - and remember the lessons! Getting crazy or silly with it helped me to put it visually into my mind, or possibly it help stick it to the right location in my mind. This is a great book for beginners and those who haven't touched Spanish in years (from high school)."
5,Quick Start Spanish,"""Quick Start Spanish"" by Arlene Julie, has been my lifeline as I have begun learning Spanish. I needed to pick up this language quickly in my new role at work and this book provided exactly what I was looking for. It is so easy to study and learn Spanish quickly. The author reinforces difficult themes with wonderful stories that make it easy to remember the grammar, verbs and vocabulary. I love her light-hearted approach to the language - she has made it fun for me. This book is for all ages and for all levels - beginners like me, or for someone who wishes to brush up on her grammar. I highly recommend it for anyone, especially those with a hectic schedule and no time to squeeze in boring language books or classes."
3,"Fun, despite being somewhat obvious","'The Paranoids' is an indie film from Argentina about two friends who are scriptwriters. Luciano is extremely passive and fearful, and is struggling both socially and professionally, while Manuel is a more aggressive and typically 'successful' guy. It is a source of tension that the latter one has created a TV series based on the former one, without first consulting with him. But it is an attractive girl, named Sofia, who most affects the dynamics of their friendship. This is one of those stories where the audience find themselves rooting for the underdog.The film is fairly watchable, although it could use a little more subtlety and character development (especially for Manuel and Sofia). The photography is nice and the soundtrack is a very cool collection of rock and electronic music, likely from Argentina. 'The Paranoids' reminds me a bit of 'Reality Bites', which has a similarly hip, MTV feeling, only this one has a distinct Latin American urban flavor."
2,Weak physical design,"I have purchased other flash drives, and know what drives will expect in their normal lifetime, about 18mo. The physical design is very weak. It is constructed of a cheap plastic that is easily crushed, the clip on the cap is held together by a screw. The silver covering is painted on and can easily be scraped while traveling in the pocket. A typical flash drive experiences a wash cycle during the lifetime, the design on this unit makes that impossible.I returned the unit because of the weak design and incorrect picture on the Amazon web site. The picture showed a swiss-knife like design where the USB connector would be protected beneath the cover. Not true.Try the Corsair 8GB Flash Drive, very tough design, water-proof, drop-resistant, and includes an encryption utility. Plus a 10 year warranty."
2,Deceptive Title,This box is not about making decorative boxes. It is about decorating boxes. There were only a couple of boxes to make. Most of the material dealt with decorating boxes that already exsist. I was disappointed.
5,If I had room..,"This is the best all-around pan you can own! It is incredibly versatile, and the non-stick is permanent, not a sprayed on layer-it won't peel off! As it is a nice heavyweight metal pan, treat it as you would cast-iron in the oven-bake things at a slightly lower temp, and they'll probably be done a few minutes sooner too! If I had the room, I'd own a dozen!"
4,"""almost""","I love this pan and use it *frequently*. I'm pleased with the finish and size. It is, however, difficult to get the inside corners clean because of the ""seams""."
4,Good Flavor and worked for my cough,"This was a very tasty cough drop, and helped soothed my cough. However the bag was small for the price and you can get a lot more cough drops elsewhere for the same cost. But overall, a good product."
5,EA Finally gets it right,"Earlier versions of this game have been flawed and contained a lot of bugs. This version has finally got the game to play like college basketball. With the slider settings you can get the game to play very realistically (Once you turn down the speed, steals and blocks). The injury bug from last year has been fixed as have a lot of the other problems.There is a new mode called the Coach K mode where you take over as coach at a small school. If you complete the goals at this school (win a certain # of games, etc.) you can then move up to a better school. Your record as a coach is tracked over time, giving you the chance to be one of the top coaches of all time (if you win!).If you can live with the psx limitations and like college ball, this game is for you. At the very least, rent it and see if you like it. If you are like me, you will buy it."
2,March Madness 2001 made me mad,"Anyone who tells you this game is really great and authentic should have their head examined. While the game is loaded with options, one thing this game is lacking on the play side is realism. First of all, it is TOO easy to block shots and steal. You can increase or decrease the difficulty, but it doest help matters. If you are looking for a realistic game to play, look elsewhere cause this one fails to reach the big dance."
5,this years National Champion (repeat performance),"Once again March Madness takes down the nets. This time with it's 2001 edition. Like MM2000 the dynasty mode was great but this years version gives you the opportunity to start out at a small school and work your way up the coaching ranks until your ready for the big time. Along with that you have the greatest teams of all time, the best girls programs, and a load of unlockable moves and options. The graphics have been improved on and the control is much better to. This is the game to have if your lookin for a college hoops game. Must Have."
4,Everything you heard was true,"Everything you have read is true about the blocking and steals. They are WAAAAAAAY overdone. It helps if you turn them down, but its still a bit too much. That said, i think the game turned out pretty well. I mean, this is just a 32 bit system and it has limited tools to work with. But its alot of fun to play and the dynasty mode rocks. If you are a college hoops fan and love the idea of turning Fordham into a national powerhouse, then this game is for you. If you like NBA Live, stick with it because this is a different game."
5,Great Game Buy This,March Madness is a great game it is the best college hoops game ever made. The dynasty mode is awesome because you can build up from a small school up to the big dance. The graphics are decent to. Gave this a 5 stars because the graphics are good and the gameplay is awesome. It lets you choose from many different college teams and 20 womens teams. This game is great by it you wont regret it.
3,March Madness 2001,"I read the reviews of this game and wanted to give it a try so I rented the game for myself. I have MM 2000 and was pleased with the game except for when I want my man to move when I say move and the game does not recruit enough players so you end up wearing the other team down even in senior mode. MM 2001 needs help. I like the fact the game will attack the basket when they have numbers and it is easier to rebound a missed shout than MM 2000. Dunking in MM2k did not have the hesitation. MM 2001 Hesitates then dunks. Fouls come to easy. The commentary, my goodness, why do they keep saying the same thing over and over again. I will only buy this game when the price drops to $... This game is not worth $..., $..., or $... for that matter. Since this will probably be the last for PS, Hopefully next version on PS2 will have more excitement. Oops, I'm sorry hopfully sega won't squeeze out MM."
2,EA'S UPSET,this am a fan to ea's sports game and i was surprized when I played this game. the game is terrible literly. the graphics stink. i gave it 2 stars cause of its originality. PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS GAME THANKS BYE
5,Fun c.d.,If you want to return to some great accordian music and cozy up to a fireplace then this music will make you feel like you are in the Alps ! I love this music and the order was perfect ! Recommend this seller .
4,Gets better and better,"Every time I buy a new recording of Johnny Logan, his music and variety of songs get better and better. I recommend this for any one looking for a new singer if you want to get away from the hard rock and the recording artists everybody listens to."
3,Cuisinart Cookware,"Good Quality product for the money. I wanted a little bit more weight, perhaps a copper bottom but the price was much higher so I compromised. This set will serve our needs well. As a couple we do not cook as much as others."
5,Great Cookware Set,This is a terrific set of cookware and contains all the pieces needed for someone starting a new kitchen. The cookware is very sturdy and the nonstick surface is so easy to clean. I like this set better than my $600+ set of Calphalon. I highly recommend this set.
3,Soulmates,This book is great in trying to educate younger people or lift their awareness levels to live healthier lives. However I discovered first hand that there is a greater gift beyond soulmates. It's the twin soul. This book is good because most people don't understand themselves or relationships enough or aren't mean to in this lifetime have the twin connection. Soulmates are also meant for our growth and most people need to understand and grow through them. That's the bigger thing most people need to understand. There are however other rarer relationships.
3,Good music video for little kids 6 and under.,"It has good facts about dinosaurs, so you are educateing the kids, but I don't watch this anymore."
1,This is a travesty!,"Anyone with the least bit of respect for movies and the music which accompanies them will stay as far away from this and other ""Land Before Time Sequel"" CDs and Movies; James Horner's soundtrack and Lucas/Spielberg/Bluth's original movie are the only forms of the Land Before Time which should be acknowledged as even being available."
2,YOU GOT WHAT U PAID FOR,"i am a single guy that cook rice maybe about 3 times a month, this rice cooker works great for the first 6 month and after that it went totally dead, i dont know why, i dont abuse it. well just keep in mind that if you going to buy this cooker, this is not something you can keep for a long time."
2,Dead after 5 months - Disposable Rice Cooker,"I bought this at a different store, not online, at a sale price of $12.00. Too good to be true. It just totally stop working after about 5 months for some unknown reason."
3,Adequate,"I was a little disappointed in the size. My old oval shaped steamer (discontinued) held almost twice as much. But it does the job. Only problem is that the automatic shutoff doesn't shut of quite quick enough. It will but the bottom if you are steaming rice. So you have to put a little extra water in, and time it yourself to keep it from sticking."
4,"DE rewiew of ""John Schneider - Greatest Hits""","This CD release is an excellent compilation of John Schneider's country music releases on MCA Records from 1984 to 1987. The only reason that I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars for a rating is that MCA ommited the #35 hit ""When The Right One Comes Along"" from the ""You Ain't Seen The Last Of Me release of 1987. It also charted higher than ""If It Was Anyone But You"" from both releases and I personally think that it was a better song. Otherwise, buy this CD."
3,Good album,"John Schneider was a fair singer, who no doubt got his start at Country Music with his Hollywood success. Still, this is a fine album. There are two stand-out numbers here: ""I've Been Around Enough to Know"", and ""I'm Gonna Love....."". Both are stone cold country and deserve their spot in Country Musics rolls. But, there's the usual early '-80's tired sound that permeated the country music scene until the neo-traditionalists brought country music back to it's roots. John Schneider has a fine voice, and it could easily be mistaken for David Frizzel, another Nashville tired voice of that time. There's a few mediocre songs here as well as the previous mentioned solid songs, but that stands to reason considering his short lived time in the spotlight."
3,needs more excitment,I am a big fan of John from The Dukes Of Hazzard and originaly bought this for my collection but after hearing it I was impressed but I like more up beat country and there was not one up beat song on the album which disapointed me but all in all a good all around CD
5,Loved it!,I've been hearing his songs on the Music Choice radio for years. Decided to buy CD. Very happy with it. Just wish he was still recording!
4,A compilation of great hits . . but not all of them,"Although only 5 albums with MCA he recorded at least 10 in total. My first recollection of John was in when I had the pleasure of seeing him perform live as an opening act for Reba McEntire in 1987. In 1988 I purchased his cassette of Too Good To Stop Now. Low Class Reunion was my favorite from that project.As an avid music collector I have 6 of his music projects. They are not all 100% stellar, but I love his deep voice and the passion that he brings out in his vocal performances. I rate him historically with the likes of Keith Whitley.This is a ""must have"" for anyone who loves the retro country music of the 1980's.By the way isn't it funny that Love, You Ain't Seen The Last Of Me is given credit to Tracy Byrd when John first sang it way back then?"
5,i love his music,"I have beem listening to John Schneider ever sence he started in 1981 with Now or never and i have the rest of his tape at home with these songs on them and i have to tell you his music is relaxing,soothing and each of his songs tell a story about how love and relationships are and just by listening to his music everyone who has ever been in love and then hurt can all relate to the songs and its like Johns way of saying i understand what you are going through i went through it to and when you listen to his music you can relate to it specially if you have ever loved and then lost.This the type of music that a person would never get tired of listing to. Oh another thing i will tell if you are ever under alot of stress just listen to one of John Schneiders songs and i will tell you what his voice and the songs just help you let go that stress thats what i do try it i promise you will see for yourselfs. I have been his fan sense 1978."
4,Awesome,"This may be my favorite Sayers novel because she builds a compelling mystery out of a seemingly routine death. Moreover, Wimsey really comes into his own during this work."
4,Who Benefits from Death?,"UNNATURAL DEATH by Dorothy L. Sayers establishes Lord Peter Wimsey as a major player as an amateur detective. Peter's sister Mary has married a policeman. His brother-in-law assists his investigations, but this one is a puzzle.A elderly lady has died from cancer, her niece inherits, but the victim's doctor believes the death was premature.As the investigation develops, others who could have presented evidence against eh niece seem to be dying. Lord Peter discovers he may be on the killer's list.Enjoy and old classic that continues to enthrall readers nearly ninety years after it was written.Nash Black, author of SINS OF THE FATHERS."
3,Classic Peter Wimsey Mystery,"Dorothy Sayers once described Peter Wimsey as a cross between Fred Astaire and Bertie Wooster, and I think that captures the character perfectly -- just the right mix of dashing, erudite and silly. Like all Dorothy Sayers's mystery work, ""Unnatural Death"" is charming, funny and highly readable. However, the actual mystery here is a little convoluted and the smoking gun a little less evident, which sometimes makes the plot feel like it's wandering. Still, if you're a devoted fan, you'll find all the things you love in these books. The dialogue is always witty and the characters engaging. On the other hand, if this is your first Peter Wimsey experience, I would recommend starting with one of the two earlier books that have more concrete ""sleuthin',"" as Lord Wimsey would say, to get a feel for the Wimsey style and the little ensemble that make up his circle."
4,Interesting 20's whodunnit,"A story overheard by chance in a restaurant puts Lord Peter Wimsey on the trail of a woman who may have committed the perfect murder. The investigation leads him and his associates, Inspector Parker and spinster detective Miss Climpson, back and forth between city and country before the suspenseful (if rather contrived) conclusion. The background and details of this novel, first published in 1927, add interest. Several lesbian characters (though never directly identified as such) figure prominently, but unfortunately author Dorothy Sayers adheres to the common theme that homosexuals are particularly prone to all manner of vices. Still, this is an enjoyable mystery."
5,"This is the ""must have"" book if your child loves trains.",This story captivated my two pre-five year-olders the first time we read it. Choo Choo decides to be naughty and runaway at breakneck speed. The illustrations are vivid and (excruciatingly) funny (to my husband and me). The conclusion is utterly satisfying with a morality within easy grasp. My boys would have me read this book at least once a day if I didn't put it out of reach. Not to worry as they have the story line and most of the dialog memorized; they reenact or tell the story by themselves. I take my engineer hat off to Virginia Burton for a wonderful first story.
3,skip the kindle edition,bought it while traveling. text w/pix is too small to read. edition adds text on next or following pages making it hard for kids to match text with the action.
5,great,"great ebook! arrived on time, it was my first ebook and it is nice. my child loves it and this is his fav. book"
5,classy,"Bought this for my 28 year old daughter and she loved it. Classy, lightweight and simple which is just what she wanted."
5,Not too big not too small,This was a success for not being able to see how big it was. Pretty when lit. Had to manipulate the candles to fit in.
5,Beautiful,"Bought this as a gift for my wife. Surprisingly the Menorah looks better than pictured. Very sturdy design, and never worried it will fall."
5,Willie Wonka CD Soundtrack,"I love this music. It was my favorite movie as a kid. Now my two sons 9, and 4 love this movie and music. I love to see them sing along to the music and its a fun and educational music. I recommend it highly."
5,Pure Genious,"This cd is absolutley AWESOME!!!!!!!! i love the movie, i love the book and the music defintly plays a big part of how the movie is. I can listen to this over and over and over again. Seriosuly, you should get this cd. it is abosutley amazing. i was so excited when i bought this because i could listen to the songs as many times as i wanted."
3,"Great music, but not enough of it!","Classic musical movie score. It captures all of the memorable moments from the movie. However, the tracking is odd. Tracks should be more numerous and well organized! Some tracks are confusing. When listening to a soundtrack, I am not sure why the producers would think that I would enjoy listening to the sound of the machine that makes ""Everlasting Gobstoppers."" A confusing buy not really worth the purchase price!."
4,willy wonka and the chocolate factory musical,i purchase this cd for my daughter Illena - who relaxes after a long shift work at the hosiptal. She is a medical doctor doing her internship in the Upstate area. She enjoys it very much along with Willy Wonka Chocolate Factory movie....
5,"I enjoy listening to all those songs,","I enjoyed listening to those songs, when I have long bus rides, or a lot of free time.I am also glad that all the information is printed correctly on the cd"
3,All these years later...,"Bought this for my granddaughter who absolutely loves this movie. It was one of my faves as a kid too. She wanted to sing along to the Oompah Loompah songs. This is NOT the best format for that because they are scattered throughout and not all verses are here, but we do listen to this often."
3,Pure Imagination,All I really wanted is the song Pure Imagination as a gift for friend. Had to buy the whole CD. No big deal. He'll get the whole CD and can do what he wants with it.
4,Songs from the Candy Man.,"WILLY WONKA AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY is a charming movie. This soundtrack to the film is a delight to own for any fans of the film. My favorites on the album are:""Golden Ticket""""Candy Man""""Pure Imagination""""Oompa Loompa""My only complaint about this album is that the tracks aren't organized very well. For example, except for the first ""Oompa Loomp"", the rest of the ""Oompa Loompa"" songs are at the end of other tracks so you have to fast forward or rewind to find what you're looking for. Also, there is a lot of dialogue and sound effects contained in some of the song tracks. I'm glad it's on there, but it would have been better if the dialogue and sound effects were on separate tracks than the songs. However, if you can deal with those little nuances, this is a wonderful cd to own."
5,Salute to Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory!,"We ordered this help familiarize our son with special needs with the music. He will be auditioning for this musical later in the year. He loves the movie and the music. It arrived way ahead of time, in good condition, plays fine. Glad we ordered it."
4,A great cd to go with the movie,Songs like 'Pure Imagination' and the 'Oompa Loompa song' are songs that I don't think you'd forget at once but when you've got the cd to go with the movie you can then play them as often or as little as you want but I love hearing Gene Wilder's voice as the guy with a pure imagination and then watching how he opened up his doors to the public and just love hearing the music and words of the other songs too.
1,"Excellent Movie, Not so excellent Soundtrack!","Great movie but the soundtrack is really annoying! I only want to hear the cute classic songs from the wonderful movie and not annoying and useless high pitched mechanical noises, if I wanted to listen to mechanical noises I would have set up my tape recorder to tape our noisy squeaky dish washer. I also don't like how the words and sounds from the movie run into the songs, it would have been better if the noises and phrases from the movie had their own seperate track so people can enjoy the songs without the distracting clutter of noise."
2,A Frost/Welty Plagiarist Minus their Talent.,Visual and philosophical ideas adopted from both writers are served with a large dollop of ordinary poetic skills. Mediocracy at its best.
3,Everything Gets Worse,"Like usual in the Fearless series when things are bad, they stay bad and often get worse for the next few books. This book is the same. Each plotline from #20, Sex gets dragged out- Ed and Tatiana get closer, Josh moves in on Heather by putting stuff in her drink and giving her a ""natural"" energy pill, and Gaia, of course, is miserable because she can't be with Ed, can't really be with anyone. George is in this story again and he is probably one of the most likable characters in the book. He cares about Gaia and her safety and tries to get her to move back in with him. By the end of the novel, Gaia is set on killing Loki (Oliver). She finally understands why her father has to stay away from her to protect her and realizes that Oliver is the liar and the killer. However, it doesn't end the way you want it to. The preview for the next book makes Lydia, Ed's new physical therapist a little suspicious and she may be connected to Loki."
2,Growing worse,"Im really getting annoyed with Fearless righ now -ok have been for a long time- why cant Pascal just give gaia a break? Nothing good ever happens anymore and Gaias becoming just another wimpy little girl. Nothing really happens in this book, except Edd gets closer to Tatiana, and Gaia continues pushing everyone she loves away. Oh yeah, and Heather..even more obsessed with Josh. Annoying. Really annoying."
2,hurry up,"... This series is getting too long and too annoying. Gaia is still avoiding Ed so Ed is sort of seeing tatiana, but he sees Gaia whenever he is with her, so he still loves her. George tells her that someone close to her father is working for Loki, and we basically find out who it is. Nothing too exciting. These books are starting to sound forced like filler books. She needs to end the series soon!!!!"
4,wow!,"over the past year when i began reading fearless i couldnt put it down, i think that francine pascal is one of the best writers out there, this persuades me into trying on of the other books that she has written!. i think that many of girls can relate to gaia which is why she is so loved by all of the fearless fans. i definately cant wait for ""alone"" (fearless,22)"
2,Sniff Sniff...,"Thought I would get the same jacket I got before... I got an Achiever XL Dec. 2005The sleeves aren't fleece, (the rest is) plus the cuff is different now :..( I got it cus I lost weight!! took me time!At least I still have the old one... didn't give away just have to fold up the sleeves!Don't want to go though the hassle of trying to return. Don't know which other jacket I could get like! I'll look to see if They have the Achiever..."
3,review on jacket,"when I saw this jacket on the website it looked very nice, but when i received it, I was disappointed and not what I expected. The sleeves are tooo! big, lots of excessive material, and it is too short sitting just above the waist. I would not recommend it."
1,Bad Jacket,"I bought this jacket (they only had 3XXX available. I recieved it ,put it on once and left it (it was warm).Two weeks later I put it on to go to work. It is way too short on the back(top to bottom) and I later discovered that the inner pocket is a hole (no pocket). I had cleaned up and threw away all the paperwork (my mistake). So I did not try to return it.It might fit someone 320lbs and 5ft 6 or shorter."
4,A good fall or spring jacket,"I was looking for lightweight fleece lined jacket for fall and spring. I live where it can get quite COLD during those two seasons, so I didn't want something that couldn't keep me warm....but I wanted a lightweight jacket for when I didn't feel quite ready to be wearing the heavy winter coat yet. The fleece in the pockets is a nice plus. The sleeves are lined (but not with fleece)....this doesn't appear to be a problem, as far as I'm concerned. So far I'm quite happy with my purchase. I usually wear a womens size large, but took the recommendation of other reviewers with this jacket and bought it in the size medium. This is sized for men, so a medium size = a womens size large. Another plus about this coat is it's price. I feel it's most def worth the price."
3,"Okay for Ray Stevens enthusiasts, but that's about it","Even for a ""Volume Two"" greatest hits collection, this one is weak. The highest charting song offered is the number 28 ""Mr Businessman"" which, in fairness, is a lot better than that chart position would indicate. However, behind that lie only the marginally successful ""Would Jesus Wear a Rolex"", ""In the Mood"" and ""Jeremiah Peabody's"" twelve word pill bottle. The remainder is even sillier than that.To keep this in perspective, it should be pointed out that much of Ray Steven's material did better on the country charts than on the pop charts, as is the case with a couple of the cuts offered here. Beyond that, most Stevens fans don't care about chart positions; they just love Ray's unique approach to the world and delightful way of putting that perspective into words and music. In that respect, this album succeeds, as it is genuinely funny. However, as a greatest hits collection, Volume 1, 2, or 57, this one just doesn't cut the mustard."
3,Disappointing movie,"I have a large collection of 1950's sci-fi movies and thought this would be a great addition, but I was very disappointed. It is a mixture of brash Americans and cerebral ""mad scientist"" Brits. Paul Douglas is the brash American and I can't forget his acting in other American films, where he seems to play the same character over and over.The premise of the story is interesting but the acting leaves a lot to be desired."
3,Read This Before,"Well, this is a fairly good book. The problem is that I read it before, about ten years ago. So, where did it get its publishing date of 2006? There may have been some minor changes, but it is really the same book I read before.Don't recall the title or author, but do remember the author. I reread it to be sure. Rather enjoyable."
3,I am glad I picked it up at the Library.........,I must tell you I skimmed most of the this novel. The beginning and the end were great. In this novel twin sisters switch places and therefore Duke Raeburn marries the wrong women - or maybe not.
4,It had my daughter sucked in for hours,"My daughter loved the game and shes still playing, it is so much fun that I can barely get her off the computer so I can work. She plays with the genie bottle all the time too."
4,OK,"My two daughters would give this a 5 star rating, I myself would give it about a 3, so we decided to give it a four.As far as price, I paid $40 and after playing it was disappointed because I paid so much for it. If I could go back I would not pay more than $25 for it.It is fun and can be a challenging game to play because they gems you must find are not always in the same place if you restart the game, so it will always be different when your kids want to play again. You can always save your game which comes in handy since there are about 5 levels you must travel through and it does get lenghtly.The only problem that we have had so far is that when you touch the magic bottle heavy items on the screen are to pick up, but for some reason they won't so we end up pressing F5 for it to work.As far as kids taking the bottle to play, I would not recommend that, since the parrell port stays attached to the bottle and cannot be removed.Sound and anmimation are good."
1,System Requirements,"Before buying, please note that this game requires a joy stick connection or game port, which some or most new systems donot have. Newer computers only have a USB port which this game is not compatiable with."
2,Don't bother!,"Don't bother with this one. It is too complicated for my 3 1/2 year old and too easy for my 8 year old. The whole game took my 8 year old about 2 hours to finish. There are no extra puzzles to make the software useable after the ""adventure"" is completed. It's now the day after Christmas and the ""bottle"" has been removed from the computer so they can play ""genie"" by themselves."
5,This review isnt any wirse than the guys before me.,"I'm waiting until my son turns 12 so he can put them in on his own. But I've seen other similar products, so.... I'm sure this stuff is great too!"
1,Yuck - 4 CDS of Junk,"I work with computers everyday and this is the worst children's software I have ever seen. You have to install it on the computer (it doesn't run just from the CD), some of the settings require changing and then the software still didn't work properly (while your child is anticipating playing the games).The Lego software has a Station Master that speaks a language that is ""all his own"" so you have to read the directions to your child.I suggest purchasing Putt-Putt or the Fredi the Fish software. Easy to install, good graphics and very interactive."
5,Nordic Pendant,"I absolutely LOVE,LOVE,LOVE this pendant. I recieve many compliments whenever I wear it, from both men and women.I purchased a different chain to wear it on."
3,"""Sppanish Nights"" by Benise","I enjoyed this music most when viewing Benise on PBS. The music seems a little ""light"" without the video. However, whenever I play the CD, I dance flamenco all through my house !"
4,Good basic product,I was concerned about whether these would end up as frisbees but so far I haven't had any problems....good solid product at a great price.
5,I'm gonna have to buy proper coasters.,"I'm now halfway through this stack, and I haven't had a single failed burn yet. I was intending to use the failures as coasters and make a nice mobile to hang over the baby's crib. I guess I'll need to buy the coasters and the mobile. The discs are superb and do what they are supposed to."
1,strange packaging,"I have to say I will most not likely buy these again because they are not easily stored. they are not in a ""cake box"" they are on a twist off spindle. You have to take the case apart and remove the spindle top to get to a disk and it has no sides. I am unsure if this will effect anything in the long run like keeping them clean but it does not look like it will. Then disks themselves seem to be working fine but like I said the packaging does this one in in my opinion"
1,Looking like a crap-shoot,"So far I have burned on only 3 of these. Only the first one, a black and white pic, turned out good, with minimal ""hiccups"".The other 2 failed miserably, and could not be played beyond the first half.Burned same movies on Best Buy generics -- and no problem.Have never had these issues before and I've burned a lot of movies over the years."
5,Good Great Allegheny Passage Reading,"My wife and I have been biking on the Great Allegheny Passage (the bike trail which connects Homestead to Cumberland, Maryland). I recalled this book as we traveled along the Youghiogheny and Monogahela Rivers and the little mill towns. I've read a number of books on this area and biographies of Frick and Carnegie, but this book is the best in giving one the feeling for the human texture of life in these steel, coal and coke mill towns, how they flourished and declined over a one hundred year period. Serrin brings together the industrial, political, cultural, religious and economic in wonderful character studies and descriptions. Anyway, reading it gives new meaning to biking along this beautiful part of the country. Levi Miller"
5,Homestead: The Glory and Tragedy of an American Steel Town,"I was born at Homestead Hospital, located between the cemetery where the dead from the Homestead Strike are buried and the mills which are the heart of this book.This book explained a lot to me about my childhood. I grew up on a street where most of my friends' fathers worked in the mill. There was always seemed to be an air of defeat or at least resignation coupled with a complete distrust of authority.That distrust played out when the mills shut down right just as I left town.This book explains what I heard and saw as a kid. And why it all came to an end.To me, it's a powerful book. It's also a book about my neighbourhood, my childhood, my heritage.It may not speak to you as it speaks to me, but I'm glad that William Serrin took the time to capture the story before it was gone.-Ed"
4,The MP3s above are not from this CD,"Just FYI!I don't know exactly what those MP3's are from, but it is not this CD.Love this CD though. Solid album.... that's why I just bought it after having it stolen 8 or 9 years ago... couldn't live any longer without it.And after playing it today it is just as good as I remembered."
4,.... WHAT!,"Steve from Miami.......Jack Frost is outta hand on this cd.I would have given it a 5 but i don't like the intro nor the outro but everything else in between is amazing.This Cd definately lives up to it's title.Listen 2 it and you'll know what i'm talking about.This Cd is like something never heard of, nice hard beats as hard as the konkrete in the NewYork City streets It can't get no better than this in the Konkrete Jungle.When it comes 2 Jungle Jack Frost is the King of New York(even if it's just for one nite)But COP this cd though it's got nothin' but the HOTNESS nothin' but lovely sooothing jungle beats that will .... the ... outta ya ear drums nah i mean son."
3,Excellent Collection of Academic Essays,"This book is rapidly becoming dated. However, it is a collection of very diverse opinions on the current (as of Dec 04) situation in North Korea. Ranging from the neo-con to direct engagement, the reader is treated to several well researched analysis and opinions on the current geo-political situation with North Korea. If you are a reasonably well educated person who is trying to get up to speed on Korea, this may be an excellent selection."
5,Liked It When I was a Kid; Enjoying it Now that I am an Adult,"I starter drinking Milo since I was two years old. It is the first energy drink for kids here in the Philippines. I recall enjoying drinking it even without milk or just eating it raw without hot or cold water when I was a toddler and can't help but love its taste even now that I am an adult.I was very happy to know that in Malaysia they have learned to mix it with Nescafe because it is also a habit of mine, and a few Filipinos. We call it the cheaper version of Starbucks coffee! :)Anyway, I drink my cup of Milo in the morning and before I sleep together with my Gene Eden Vir 101 supplements so I can keep those Chronic Viruses away from my body. The weather in the Philippines is so unpredictable I will need to boost my immune system to the highest level. I suggest you do the same with your body. Milo and Gene Eden combination is a cheap price in comparison to the health benefits it will provide to your body."
5,It's the best!,"I tried to offer it to some American friends before but somehow they all view it as some inferior product from another country that they refuse to taste, well it's their loss!This is one of the yummiest chocolate drink out there. To make it even tastier, try putting some thick cream with it (like the ones you use for baking, DO NOT use those soy based ones as they don't complement the taste). Then aerate it by using two cups, one empty and one with the drink mixed with water and milk, then you use gravity to spill it from one cup to the other. Repeat for further aeration, the higher you can do it the more aeration (hence more foam effect). If you have condensed milk, use that one as well for good taste.The drink goes great with butter/cream crackers. Enjoy!"
3,Okay album,"Violator 2.0 is a pretty mediocre album. There are some bright spots on the album, however. The lead single, ""What It Is"" is pretty good. There are also good performances from Noreaga, Capone, Butch Cassidy, Kurupt, and others on the album. There is also an incredible Jadakiss/Prodigy collaboration the album. But its not all good, however. The song ""Sexual Chocolate"" should have DEFINITELY been left off the album. Plus, the CD features artists I dont particularly care for like LL Cool J, Ja Rule, Remy Martin. Overall-its a pretty okay album, but right now the hip-hop market is flooded with much better albums."
4,It;'s pretty good,I have to admit that I really just got this cd for the new Busta song but the rest of the cd actually isn't that bad. It's not a cd you can listen to all the way through because you can only listen to rappers say (n word) so many times.
1,Damn!!! Nore and Styles!!!! Damn!!!!!,"Styles and Nore are killing it on Come thru!!!! You aint never heard anything like this track. It's just some crazy (...). Grimey is dope 2, but the rest of the cd is weak though."
3,V 2.0.,"I've just recently purchased Violator 2.0. due to the fact I was sitting in my room and going through my record collection and realised I never purchased the second Violator LP. After getting it for 3.00, I had a listen and some of the tracks I already heard before and I have to say I was kinda disapointed. Not a good as the first one, however it was nice to hear some old song that I haven't heard in a while. Took me back to my high school days, but I digress. There are some highlights, such as N.O.R.E's Grimey, Memphis Bleek, Geda K - We Are... and the hidden track Options by Noyd and Capone. Other tracks were average at best. It's funny how commercial rap has changed, from then to now. I remember hating Busta Rhymes' What It Is, but now, I'd rather listen to that than listen to Lil' Wayne's Lollipop."
4,Livin' The Life,"This album falls just short of great because some of the tracks are of poor quality. The best tracks are Livin' The Life and Grimey. The rest are ok, except pop rappers like Ja Rule and LL Cool J should of been left off. Get the album for some nice beats though"
3,Not bad-- I didn't say it was good neither,"This album is OK. There are like 6 songs worth listening to.What it is, Grimey, Comin Thru, Livin the Life, Die III and The next generation. #s 4 and 5 are OK and none of the others are worth listening to EVER!!"
3,Not very innovative...,"This book is so basic, for people who do not pay attention to mainstream marketing. It gives advice such as (on decorating for Easter): ""decorate should be pastel colors, easter eggs, bunnies"" Like I never would have thought of that!Just watch what all the mall shops do and copy them - No creative, original ideas here, just rehash of what has already been done. Red hearts on Valentines, Santa Claus at Christmas..."
5,Fiver stars,The product arrived quickly and was exactly as advertised. I would order from this person again in the future.
1,defective merchandise,I am returning this item. It was made poorly. I just have used it a few times and washed it like the rest of the set and rim has flaked off. Thank goodness it was not a gift.
2,"Good artwork, but really just a children's book","""Out of the Cradle"" is a great book to buy for children who are interested in space, to get them more excited. However, the artwork in some places is outdated, and there is little but token human presence in any of the pictures. For the purposes that this book serves, I think that the original pictures are far more tantalizing than some watercolor facsimiles."
3,Mission:Impossible LP,"This is a Cd edition of the two Mission Impossible album LP's released in the 60's. The original titles of the LP where ""Mission: Impossible"" and ""More Mission:Impossible"". Almost all the tracks are composed by Lalo Schifrin except ""Cinamon"" by Jack Urbont, ""The Chelsea Memorandum"" by Shorty Rogers and ""Foul Play"" by Richard Hazzard. While is not the original soundtrack it has all the themes of the show expanded in a theme format, and is the perfect companion for ""The Best Of Mission Impossible"" (Crescendo) that contains original recordings."
5,Mission Enjoyable,"Since I received my cd, I have listened to it quite often. I like it even more than the soundtracks to the more recent ""Mission Impossible"" films! It really swings!"
5,Why Do We Never Get To Hear This In Church?,"On her CD ""Walking in the Light"", Inga Rumpf from Hamburg sings Christian songs which she also performed on the World Exhibition EXPO 2000 in Hannover. With her sonorous smoky voice that almost sounds black and a great ensemble she reaches new dimensions of Christian pop. Some songs also are influenced by different kinds of ethnic music - e.g. ""Power and Peace"" or ""Make my day"" which arouse carribiean feelings or ""Tell Me Good News"" that creates an oriental atmosphere. The sound of each of her songs that she composed by herself is always brilliant and excellent."
2,what?????????,"I cant believe it ko kings 2k was so much better. I think the thing that did it for me was the lack of realism, I mean whe they punch the arms look like their about to fly out of their sockets.Also they dont even look like their boxing the boxers have no facial expression at all.One thing that is cool is the Career mode thats the only reason this game even got two stars the thing is when u play the career mode its just a little to easy to beat, even the last fight i beat my first try. All i have to say is the game was very dissapointing and didnt show the potential of EA sports, sorry guys I just cant give this anymore than 2 stars.Adios!"
1,KO Kings BITES,"This game made me want to throw the controller after 5 minutes of playing. The limp wristed slow-motion punching makes the boxers look like wimps. I recently purchased HBO Boxing and although it lacks some of the graphics, it plays WAY better than KO Kings. In KO Kings you can't punch and move at the same time. You can't block and move at the same time either. The ""shove"" button is too easy to accidentally hit... the list goes on. I was expecting way more from this game, but it's gameplay is nowhere near HBO Boxing."
4,Worth the price,"It may not be the best computer game ever written. There are some with more realism and better graphics, but what the heck it isn't all that expensive. My son and I are having a good time beating each other up.There is one very cute thing in the program. EA put in a boxing stadium in Redwood Shores California where they are based. The funny thing is that there is no bxing arena in Redwood Shore!! It is just where EA is based. I thought that was a nice touch.Go ahead and get it, just don't expect it to be an earth shattering experience."
3,"A wonderful strong and deep voice, some very nice songs","Chavela Vargas, has a very beautiful voice : powerful, deep, and she shows a lot of strong feelings. The last song, ""Bien paga"",a sort of ballad is my favorite. The music is less interesting, with a kind of ""Mariachi Orchestra"" arragements. The first time I heard this women was, in th e movie "" The flower of my secret"" of Almodovar, with the song "" En el ultimo trago"", the fabulous song that Mariza Paredes watched on the TV, in a bar... But this song does not belong to this CD..."
2,Author/Publisher--Please hire a professional copy editor!,"I guess I don't need tips dressing, packing, nor do I need makeup tips. I can't eat chocolate. There is nothing in this travel book that is new or different. I would recommend a more professionally published book by Fodor's or Rick Steves.I have to admit, I only made it to Section 4 because this book is in terrible need of a professional copy edit. I got too frustrated."
2,All alone in the world: children of the incarcerated: a review,"I think it is deplorable that you should be selling a 3 page document for $10! Especially disappointing is throughout the article, someone named Bernstein is mentioned as though s/he wrote the book. From the bibliographic citation, it seems the book was written by Deborah Volat, a certified professional midwife. Who is Neil Bernstein? Is this a review of a review of Volat's book?"
5,Wish Pearl Kit,I gave this necklace to my granddaughter for Christmas. A big hit! She made a wish and placed the pearl inside the necklace. It's packaged very creatively. An excellent present for any occasion. You can't go wrong with giving a gift like this. It's very special.
2,Not As Expected,"Was a gift, and I had asked for sterling sliver. This is silver plated, and the silver plating wore off very quickly, leaving me with an ugly brown pendant. Don't waste your money on silver plated, go for a sterling silver version."
1,Real Clam - Dead or Alive?,"I actually loved this gift when I got it quite a few years ago. However, now I'm older and my viewpoints have changed since I've lived away from home and been introduced to more than what I grew up with in a small town. How is it that EVERY one of these clams has a pearl? Obviously someone had to have deliberately put that grain of sand into the clam and then killed it for commerce. I ask, where is the magic in that? How can a wish truly come true from that? Would I even want it to at that cost? Simple answer: NO! I am personally very glad that I lost this necklace a long time ago. If I still had it, I would through the necklace in the trash and the pearl out into the sea in meak apology. If you have one of these, that is my suggestion to you. And DO NOT buy this product now! Nothing in nature should be forced like this."
4,"Excellent for natural history buff/environmentalist, but...","This book fulfills its promise to provide information for those among us wanting to know as much as possible about the bandit. The only shortcoming is the sparcity of photos and the absence of even a single color print. I blame not the author for his writing is impeccable.Still, this book is well worth the money!"
5,"You'll love this album, It's fantastic",Don't listen to the review above.Don't try to compare and contrast Unbunny to any other group or artist.Just sit back and allow all of Unbunny's work to become one artist you wouldn't know what to do without.I did and I'm better off because of it.P.S. You should check out everything else Unbunny's released. All of it is simply amazing.
5,sharpen your scissors instead of buying new ones,"All those dull old scissors I collected over the years, as they gradually lost their edge, are now SHARP. I stumbled across this product while looking for a knife sharpener. Since I was about to buy yet another pair of scissors, I decided to try it. It really put a good edge on all my shears (except pinking, nail and hair - which it does not sharpen). You have to be somewhat careful holding the blade at the correct angle, as there is a bit of wiggle room under the guide. One practice run with a cheap pair of scissors should suffice, however, and it is wonderful to have really sharp scissors again. Lots of them!"
3,Some scissors,"I purchased this sharpener because the Chef's Choice knife sharpener is wonderful. The scissors sharpener is not so wonderful. It is capable of one angle on the coarse side and two angles on the fine side. If you have scissors with the angle it was made for then it's great. If you have scissors with the ""knife edge"" angle, there is an adapter for the fine side only. Therefore, if you cut a pin, you can't use the coarse side. If you have different scissors yet, if will completely ruin them. It is quite helpful to take the scissors apart to fit them into the machine."
2,Cannot get it to sharpen. Too confusing to use.,"I watched the video on how to use and tried it on a couple of different pairs of scissors. I find it very confusing and cannot figure out the angle to make it work. All of the pairs I tried to sharpen got dents in the blades and didn't seem to sharpen them much at all. Edges are now rough on the scissors even after running it through fast like the video says to smooth off the burrs. Unless you are experienced with this type of sharpener and have used them before, I would not recommend buying this model. Very dissapointed."
1,Very dissatisfied,"I am sorry ScissorPro. It is not the product, it is the company. I purchased this expensive scissor sharpener for my mother as a Christmas gift, not knowing that she had one already. When we inquired about returning the item for a refund we were told that we could not get a refund we HAD to get store credit. I have never heard of this especially ordering online and for Christmas. We had the original box, and receipt. We also contacted Amazon and they were no help. Although they were the original company I ordered from. It took a great deal of time, phone calls, and red tape and as of Feb. 15th I am yet to receive the store credit. I WILL NEVER ORDER FROM AMAZON.COM OR ALL BRAND AGAIN."
1,Do not like this product,Did not like this product AT ALL! I think it ruined my scissors. The vendor gave me excellent service but the product is not worth anything.
5,"Excellent, as I expected from Chef's Choice","I have their knife sharpener and it's awesome, so when I needed a scissor sharpener I went back to Chef's Choice. The instructions were a little strange and difficult for me to understand, but once I figured out everything in the pictures was backwards, I got the hang of it. And it works GREAT. Old scissors that have been annoying me for years are like new again."
5,Scissors rescued from the dead,Old scissors ready for the trash were revitalised - really sharp. Some couldn't even cut paper. Now they are wicked sharp.
4,Good product...,"Excellent for regular scissors, not so good foe ""knife-edge"" types. Suction feet keep it in place - Nice! Decent instructions included..."
5,Voegelin redivivus,"An amazing video document. The sound is not the greatest, given the recording technology of the time, but just the fact that it has been recorded and is now available is simply fantastic.Moreover, the producers of the DVD have put a lot of thought into creating and packaging this product. You can tell they care about the quality of this DVD. They must be commended for all their excellent efforts. Don't wait, buy your copy today!"
5,ANDREWS SISTERS NEED A DECENT BOX SET,"This is a very good collection of some of the Andrews Sisters best material, with tracks 1 thru 13 being simply magic. There's also Volume Two of this series that's worth picking up. Both Volumes 1 and 2 have good sound quality and nice booklets. There's also a great collection called ""Selection of Andrews Sisters"" which gives you a bunch of great tunes that aren't on these two volumes.PS: THE ANDREWS SISTERS NEED A DECENT BOX SET!!!"
2,Lousy volume,"I tried this phone with a new Cingular connection this month and found it wanting. The primary difficulty was the volume. Although I kept turning the volume up, the sound did not improve, and I could barely hear my conversations. Thinking the problem might have been an inadequately charged battery, I charged the unit overnight. But the sound level was still poor the next morning.When I returned to the Cingular store the next day, the clerk said that my complaint about this unit was a common one. Be warned.There was in this case a happy ending: I returned the phone for an even exchange and am happy with the Samsung model I obtained as a replacement."
5,Good Buy,"This is a nice small phone and it doesn't take up your whole face when you're talking. the picture quality is great and all this different customizing options are cool. i'm 15 and got this phone for my birthday so it's a good gift for teenagers and people of all ages.****UPDATE****When this phone breaks down...the phone breaks. It doesn't hold well when dropped. After a couple of months, I had two pieces of one whole phone."
2,Find something else,"Frankly, I wish I had the free Nokia brick phone I had before this one back. Call volume horrid. Many times I can barely hear the person to whom I'm speaking, and many times that person can hear the background noise better than they can hear me. Lots of dropped calls. The OS can be slow and a pain to navagate.If a Cingular salesperson steers you toward this one, find something else."
2,Screan leaked,"These new generation phones are so gentle and break very easily. Our two motorola's phones V180 and V550 broke after just a year of used. The common problem is leaking screan if you drop the phone, so your screan goes blind. Go for some other brand ...."
5,It's an OK phone,"i've had my Nokia 6102 phone for about 2 1/2 months now. When i firsy got it it was great, everything worked i didnt have any problems. Then after i started using more often i realised that when you are sending or recieving a text message or recieving a phone call, and ur watchin TV or listening to the radio, you will here this weird noise come from the TV or radio's speakers. It's really weird. And another thing, i recently had some problems with my phone just shutting off n me even with full battery. The good thing about this phone is that u can take pictures and record things."
5,Great phone!!!!,"Great phone. Nothing super fancy. FM radio has good sound and can be heard though any ear bud or headphones. Have to have the head phones to hear the FM radio. I guess thats Nokias way of getting you to buy accessories. I suggest downloading the free Nokia Sync software (...). I charge it one time a week, but then again I don't use the phone a ton either but my old Motorola 720, which was a piece of crap, had to be charged every 1.5 days.Highly recommend this phone."
3,Earpiece is too small and volume too low,"I got the phone 5 days ago from Cingular. I hasitated for a while and finally decided to return it for exchange to other phone.The main problem is the earpiece is too small with which you cannot hear the other party's voice clearly, unless you put the hole right above your ear, which is very difficult to locate. Each time, I have to try several times before I can place it correctly. I think other things are good for this phone.I had Nokia phone previously with very good experince. But why this phone was designed so stupidly?! The earpiece is a small thing, but also the biggest one for a phone."
2,Nokia 6102,"This is a GREAT phone EXCEPT for the power connector. The pin inside the phone is so small and fragile that it can accidentally be really easily bent or broken off. This cost me $115 because Nokia classified the problem as ""Physical damage"" and the warranty does not cover physical damage. This is ridiculous. It is an obvious design problem."
2,Good phone but outside LCD is not durable,"I have owned this phone for about 2 months and the exterior LCD cracked. I did not drop it but simply placed it in my pocket and sat on a couch. It is just not durable and Cingular refused to replace it.Pros: battery life, MP3 ringtonesCons: The phone is not durable, you cannot configure it to display the date on the outer LCD, the games that come with it are terrible."
3,Poor audio volume ... non-intuitive menus,"Have had this phone for 4 days and am going to return it, despite the fact that it's an attractive phone with a good form factor. Main reasons for returning are (1) poor audio volume even when set to max; (2) menus are not intuitive; (3) display info is in vanishingly small fonts and icons, and (4) I don't like the ""flat"" phone book entries [that is, each name only has one number associated with it. In contrast, my former mobile phone (Sanyo) could store multiple numbers (work, home, mobile, ...) with one name]. Sorry to have to change phones, since I like Nokia, generally."
1,This phone sucks.....BIG TIME,"I've gone through 5 of these phones in less than a year. The first one had echos so bad it didn't even recognize the voice tags and people said I sounded like I was talking under water. The 2nd one just plain died one day and wouldn't even take a charge or turn on. The 3rd one drained the battery from a full charge to almost nothing in a couple of days without even using it or having it turned on. The 4th one I just got yesterday worked for a day and now turns on but none of the buttons work and I can't even access my address book. Cingular has finally offered me a different brand, which I have checked out on Amazon's site hoping to get one with a good review. Now I have to negotiate with them to get the matching accessories.....Steer away from Nokia 6102....."
2,"Nebulous controls, poor audio","I have used this phone for a week, and I'm returning it.Pros:1. Cool-looking phone - black, red and chrome.2. Color screen is good.3. Very compact.Cons:1. Audio volume is very low, even when set to highest setting. Conversations were often hard to hear in the car with the windows up and the stereo off.2. Lack of side keys for settings makes even the most basic changes - ring volume, call volume, etc. - difficult.I will grant that it's a quality phone and that the phone is well-made and has no defects. It would be a great entry level phone for the average person who doesn't change settings - and has above average hearing."
1,"Not 13, easier this way, bad phone.","I am not hard to please when it comes to cell phones, as long as it has a camera and it rings and I can talk to people it will do. My old Kyocera model is better than this. (This is after a basketball hit it two or three times.) The phone for some strange reason shorts out on me. It goes off randomly and doesn't come back on and this has happened to me three times this year. The first time it happened it was at the worst moment possible: A snowstorm at 2 AM is not an ideal setting for your phone to short out. The sencond time it happend randomly and the third time it did the same thing.I am a bit surprised because Nokia is very good at making phones and this is a disappointment. I plan on getting a new phone soon and probably a different model most likely. All I can say is if you choose this phone be aware, it does some crazy things."
3,Bug in Software,"I am a big fan of nokia and all my previous mobiles were nokia..But this one is a big disappointment..I am surprise to find that there is a bug in their s/w.If you change the profile from Normal to Silent and then backagain to Normal, the incoming phones are having not so consistent ringtones. Sometimes it will ring and sometimes it wont, just the light will be flashed.Currently I removed the battery and restarted and its working fine. But dont know how long it will work.I think Moto Razr is much better than this phone for the same price range."
2,What Could Have Been,"Well I finally recieved my copy of IHRA DRAG RACING. I had been waiting for this for years, drag racing on a home game console.It was very dissapointing. First of all the title discription is NOT accurate. It must have been for another version of the game. There is only half of the stuff included in this version as far as car tinkering, game details, tracks and missing other aspects that were supposed to be there all together. I was hoping for more of a Grand Torismo type game only for drag racing. What I got is a stripped down second rate version designed for a 12 year old, or someone that knows or cares nothing about cars. Graphics are fair at best and game play is not realistic at all. This is the only game of its kind so I will deal with it and play, but is a far cry from what could have been. I hope the PS2 version will be better planned out."
2,This game is not what i thought it would be.,"This is alright for a 10 year old kid that likes cars.But for older teenagers this is not what i thought it would be.I thoughtit would be like a Grand Turismo style. The music options (are bad) because you have to turn the music off everytime you race.You can't ajust the steering,the cars are alright but the wheels (are bad),the slicks on the top fuels are very narrow.I still play the game because I like drag racing but there are alot of things that need changing.The need to put some pickup trucks and different cars on it too."
1,ihra,"I was disapointed it was not as advertised. Only 6 tracks,no reaction time, not much tuning ,graphics an drive ability or fair."
2,sabsi rice,"It is edible, but does have that instant/boxed food taste. If you like the boxed au graten potatoes, stovetop stuffing, etc. you will like this. If you are into homecooked then, you might not like it as much."
5,believable,"Aeolus Kephas has a very inviting ,and easy to understand writing prose reminicent of the great authors of psycology or philosphy Jung,Freud and Nietzche,very good book,a must read for those interested in the occult and paranormal.RRM"
4,Works like a charm,CLP cleaner works fantastic! Love that it doesn't stink so bad like the one they use in the Marine corps!Would definitely recommend it to fellow gun lovers.
4,"For an All-in-one solution, this stuff is pretty darn good!","I bought this stuff as a recommendation from a friend. I have to say that it works pretty well for cleaning, lubing and protecting my AR-15. The only reason that I gave it 4 stars was that it is not the best fast acting carbon remover. The stuff works well, especially if you saturate the dirty parts and let them sit for a bit.I have only used this stuff once on my AR, which was pretty dirty, so I don't have an extensive write-up for you, but it worked well while cleaning. My Marine buddy swears by the stuff, which is a pretty solid endorsement.If you are looking for a one-shot product that does it all well, look no further."
5,Best Product For Proper Firearms Care,I have used BreakFree CLP for years. There is nothing else on the market that can better it.
2,Boring!,"This tape failed to capture my son's attention. If I sat with him he would watch for maybe a minute and then begin squirming and want to leave the room. My son loves watching videos so for him to not be even a little interested, this must be the most boring and unappealing kid's video ever."
2,Not the best out there,"First, the little bear cub starts talking about how much he LIKES his diapers. Not a bad thing, but the only real transition or inspiration he gets in wanting to wear underwear is that his neighbor and friend wears them. There's a lot more going through a 2 or 3 year olds' head than just someone else is doing it.Second, the characters mouths don't move. It's a narration, not a cartoon so all the characters have the same voice too.Last, there really isn't anything that's a catch phrase or song that is useable for training when the movie isn't on. Other DVDs and movies are more agressive in their training tactics."
5,Great Intro To Potty Training,I was looking for a video to spike my 2+ year old daughter's interest in potty training and this one did the job beautifully. She loves the story about the little bear and the silly songs and is now asking about a potty and big kid underwear. The video's gentle tone also complements the various potty books I've purchased for bedtime reading. I don't expect an animated video to present the same level of detail as a video with real kids so in contrast to other reviewers it doesn't bother me that the bear doesn't wash his hands(paws?). My husband and I can deliver that message more effectively anyway. This video is a nice soft sell introduction to potty training and I recommend it for that purpose.
1,Takes too long to get to the point!,The first 10 minutes or so talks all about how GREAT diapers are. Not good.My son loses interest after that and tells me he wants his diapers back.The movie is also not typical animation. It is narrated with one voice.
2,BEARS DON'T USE THE POTTY,"The characters are bears - boy bear, his parents, and friend - girl bear. Not every child has a ""Mommy"" & ""Daddy"" - By now we should acknowledge that!The potty & big boy pants - songs are way too long! & It would be better if the girl bear also had a big girl pants & potty song too!"
3,It's a Picture book on video with narrator,"I saw the DVD last night with my daughter and I thought it was boring. It's a story book put into the form of a video. Someone narrates the story. They only show the boy bear going to the potty once or twice. Not much information to teach my child to go to the potty. I had to sit with her and say ""you see the boy's going to the potty"". Because we as adults know that bears don't go in the potty. It's a very short video, and I don't think that the price goes with the product. I got mine used."
1,Not a good Potty Training tool,"This video starts out real cute,but they take way too long to get to the point. The majority of the video talks about how much the little bear loves his diapers and love having ""diaper time"" with his parents. By the time it gets around to talking about going potty on the toliet, my 2 year old was bored and on to something else. If anything this video will hinder Potty Training becasue of how much the little bear loves his diapers!"
2,No More Diapers please!,"This video was a little too delicate on this matter. If you prefer to use such phrases as ""wee wee"" and ""wonderous, underous pants"" this video will compliment your household. It did not include important messages about washing your hands after using the bathroom nor what to actually do on the toilet. I purchased the video to encourage my three year old son to get over the last obstacle of potty traning. The only result was that he has reverted to calling it ""wee wee"" instead of what it really is. The animation was dodgy but appropriate for small children. I would only recommend this video for children that have not begun the process yet otherwise it is very vague and a tad overly annoying."
1,"cute, but....","Although my 32-month old loves to watch this movie, it has done nothing to further his interest in the potty. I think it spends too much time focusing on how great diapers are and the quality time Glen gets during diaper changes. It would have been nice too, if maybe Glen tried to go potty a time or two with no success, to show that it's okay not to get it on your first try. I know we have tons of tries before we have success. I agree with other reviewers that don't like that it doesn't address wiping or washing hands. We have ordered Potty Power and it should be here anyday..."
1,It is worst potty traing vedio.,"I bought this video for my 2.5 year old son, but the video had no special things to train any kid. My son did not show any interest to watch it again. The duration of the video is hardly 15-20 mints.I thought it would have another story/ cartoon for potty taring but it was not. I do not recommend to anyone to spend even a dollar on it."
3,Pretty Good,"Skillet is my favorite band. I love Alien Youth. This album has a lot of secular/punk/emo songs though, and that took away from the experience."
4,Bernadette comes across as stuck-up in this film,"The story is very well told, it is a beautiful movie but they have Bernadette act in a fashion that seems like she is in love with herself, she is harsh on others and you think ""the real Bernadette would have never said that"". But in other parts, it still is a good movie and the lines seem to be real quotes. The part where she is told ""... God alone is enough"" or how her fear of the devil's deceptions is dispelled is very good while the part with the bishop is kind of silly. Just like in the first Bernadette movie, she refuses to drink the milk that the priest offers her, no child of that time, so poor and so drilled to respect the priest and to respect elders, would turn this offer down and not even say thank you. The spirit of Bernadette is best captured in the old Jennifer Jones movie but for modern times, I would say, it still is a very good film, both films with Sidney Penny."
2,Bernadette,I purchased this film to appreciate the story of Bernadette. I'm planning on going to Lourdes this summer and wanted more insight into her story. Although in color this film doesn't do the justice to the story that Werfels Song of Bernadette did. The acting leaves a lot to be desired. The only part I really enjoyed was the actual footage from Nevers.
2,"If you want to hear Dalida, get another album.","First, you must know (which I didn't when I purchased this item) is that it IS A SOUNDTRACK for a French TV movie about DALIDA. This movie is not available in the U.S. as far as I can find. Most of the music is instrumental, with a few vocals - none, are Dalida.The music is not without merit. It has a very nice ""international/world"" sound. Ezio Bosso and Jean-Marie Senia have put together a very nice CD of mid-century Euro-music with just a twist of mid and far east for flavor. I plan to mix it in with my Cinema Paradiso soundtrack or maybe some Mancini and Mychael Danna soundtrack items.However, for those looking for the vocal styling's of the internationally famous French singer, Dalida, direct yourself elsewhere."
5,WHAT a surprise!!,"I have never been disappointed with a Hudson based game :) I thoroughly research a game before purchasing it. Read reviews on here and on Game Faqs.comThis is one of the few, unadulterated games I have played, apart from Golden Sun, in awhile. The quest is VERY original-Zelda-type and addictive. ACTUALLY enjoyable. This is Bomberman fun with a nice blend of RPG..unfettered. I cannot stand those platform RPG combos (The latest Zelda games)...very few pull that off effectively. Bomberman Tournament is a great game for those days when you don't want to break your fingers and controller. SURPRISINGLY fun game!!If you want epics this is not for you. If you want fun gaming with some challenge...this is it!PS: BTW according to Nintendo The Legend of Zelda is not an RPG but has always been classified as an action adventure. Was I surprised with that one :)"
4,Great game,I go tell you what made me buy a type of bomberman.Blast your way thruogth levels by destroying your opponents with STRATEGICALLY place bombs .That rigth there made me buy bomberman online for dreamcast.This not as good as that vison but is still great and fun
5,SWEEEEET!!!,this game rocks it has good graphics and quest mode is really fun I recomend this game to anyone that wants to have fun.
2,Short and a rip-off of Zelda,"First off, this game is way too short. Plus, there's not much replayability involved in it.Also, it seems more like a Zelda game than a Bomberman game. Yeah, there's Bomberman action, but let's see what it has in common with the Zelda games:-Various dungeons with puzzles in it, where you find items to help you continue, and also a boss in each.-At the end of each dungeon, you get a ""heart"" that increases the amount of damage you can take.-You'll find a map to help you out somewhere in the dungeon-As you go along, you'll get different kinds of weapons-And others.Also, the Charaboms are clearly a rip-off of Pokemon. And finally, as stated previously, the game is too short, and it lacks replayability. However, it IS fun while it lasts, which is while I gave it 2 stars instead of 1."
5,This Game Is Awsome,I own A Game Boy Advance and have rented this game twice. I've Played with my friends the multi-player game and its a game for all people of all ages. I know this Because one of my friends is an RPG freak and another one of my friends loves fighting games. So as you can see its an awsome game for everyone... HOPE YOU BYU IT BECAUSE I'M GONNA!!!
2,Ok...its fun for a while,This game is fun to mess with their hair and stuff... but after u get all the prizes and new stuff..it isnt fun any more
3,OK,"This item is ok, and can use some work. Once you get all of the gifts for your Diva Starz, you can't get anything else, and it's not all that fun."
4,Brake Rotors,"I have had these rotors on the car for 2k miles now. They work well. I had some slotted Power Slots on before and they did not work out so well from the start. They made noise and had vibrations from the very first moment they were on the car. I found out why when I replaced them with these Centric rotors. The rotors had a crack where the hats met the rotor, terrible defect. I had used Centric pads and rotors in the past with no problems and I went back with them."
5,10-Song Essential,"With ""50 Number Ones"" out for sale, it's hard to argue a better economical and jam-packed value, but there's no disputing the best 10-song collection belongs to Greatest Hits Vol. 2. George remains the most consistent country artist within the last 40 yrs (I would argue the most consistent in COUNTRY MUSIC HISTORY), and the proof lies in GH Vol 2. For those who remember cassettes (much less 8-tracks, a couple of George's I own), nothing quenched the thirst of country traditionalists in the 1980's like this album. My father and I took many a road trip from Texas to Montana (a one-way 3-day trip) to the tune of GH Vol 2. Absolutely, positively, the soundtrack of my life."
3,Errrrrrrrr.... What's in it Folks?,"What the hell this contains? I'd really, really like to know that! I don't give 5 stars 'cause I don't believe that this package is excellent... Maybe a couple of singles and a T-Shirt... but I'd like to know..."
2,Nothing Special,I don't like this much. It's very generic Power Metal. The singer is average. The guitar sound is a touch heavier than your typical happy power metal in that the guitars are slightly more dirty like a progressive power metal band such as Secret Sphere. It's getting awful tough to make an impact using this style but it can be done. I like the effort here and the recording is very polished but it just doesn't stand out in quality or originality.
4,A little out of date but still worthwhile,"Definitely not new-age drivel. I found the essays authoratative, imaginative, and beautifully written. However this book was of limited usefulness for me and ( for different reasons )it may likewise fail to engage those who are not familiar with certain dogmas and apologetic arguments. Teilhard de Chardin wrote most of this in the 1920s before the second Vatican council accepted evolutionary theory. Since then, his enemy has changed from modernism to post-modernism. His essays will seem unnecessarily radical, mystical and, frankly, too preoccupied with Catholicism for skeptics and evangelicals who may be drawn to the book looking for perspectives on the current evolution/creation crisis.Students of the history of religious thought may give this book a higher rating than mine, and justifiably so. I blush to admit that I don't know the significance of the author in that history."
1,hummmm,so far in my class it is probablly the same way i use it in my intro to logic class same as the one the guy before me wrote probably the same teacher i have. i like the book. I am taking the class again 4 years later and I think the book is still good but needs more examples of symbolism
5,"Thank God for this product, I love it!","I am so fair that I don't tan, I burn ... It is because of this product that I can now wear shorts to go outside and feel totally comfortable in them. It is simple to use as you use circular motion exactly as if you were applying skin lotion. And the best part is that you can see exactly where you are applying it, and therefore it leaves no streaks. I use a second application and it lasts me personally more than a week. Word of advice though, if you are like me and you use hair removing lotions such as Nair, the tan does come off along with your hair when you wash your legs...At this time, I just wait a day and re-apply. But other than that, this product is GREAT. I highly recommend it."
5,Best Self-Tanner,"This is a great self-tanner, the best I've used. Looks very natural and smell is not that bad and mostly goes away quickly.I have not been able to find this product recently and I hope it returns to the market soon."
1,Yuck!,"This novel is not the type you can sick back and enjoy. It is depressing, and after reading the book myself I felt really down. It was so frustrating because the whole time the girl was following after this guy ho was so selfish and wasn't even worth her time. I cannot relate to the heroine, didn't she have any pride? I don't care if it is educational or whatever, it was the most dissapointing and frustrating book I have ever read, and I have read a lot of books. I would NOT recomend this book to anyone, especially not to children."
5,Ghoulish fun!,"I just love this CD. The music is so tight, and imaginitive. I wouldn't have believed that ""surf"" music could sound like this. It really rocks!"
3,Goofy spooky go-go music,"Pretty good instrumentals interrupted here and there with dumb haunted house humor. The songs are right up there with Man or Astroman in quality, but the humor is stupid."
3,"Music Good........""Plot"" Bad!","Ok, so I bought this album for the Disneyland: Haunted Mansion cover. I was'nt disappointed. Cool take on theme, musically. However the little storyline voice overs are awful. Unpollished and far from clever, these little audio bits fail. If only they had dropped a couple of bucks to bring in some cool voice over actors, it would have been a complete and cohesive success. Ah well...nice try."
1,Nothing of value here,"Poorly written, no insights, lots of hype and he doesn't show you how to DO anything. Except take your money for a book about nothing."
3,Not Very Good,"Purchase this book at your own peril. Even though Joe Rubino himself signed the book I bought I thought it was empty. There was no real meat in the book. I didn't get a sense of, ""well great now I think I know what I;m doing."" This is a great plan. Even when I went ahead and bought his 7 Steps book, it was only marginally better, but not great. There was some very useful information in the book though. But neither book is going to quench your thirst. You'll end up searching elsewhere for the answers you are searching for."
4,"Secrets of Building A million Dollar Network Marketing Organization: From a Guy Who's Been There, Done That,and Show's You How t",It gives you good information.
3,Some parts are good,The best part is the WHY. Your why gives you power in weak moments.Chapter 3 can get you in troubles! He speaks about prospecting sources without giving more details. Listening to some of his ideas without studying them further in different books made me lose lots of money. He should have written one whole chapter for each prospecting sources.
5,almost unbelievably good,"Not to knock the many violinists who have done soulful powerful renditions of the 2nd Violin Partita, but Segovia's transcription of Chaconne is simply phenomonal! This CD is particularly moving for guitarists."
3,Disappointing version,"Segovia recorded many pieces several times in his career -- those of Bach especially -- and the anthologist is presented with a thorny problem: to go for performance or recording quality, or a balance of both? By and large the choice here is happy (especially since the artist's earlier Bach recordings are available, on theEMI anthology), and John Duarte's transcription of the 3rd 'Cello Suite was recorded only once.But the ""Chaconne"", which should be the crown jewel of the album, is a big disappointment. Although recorded in 1954, it sounds absolutely limp compared to the wild passion of the 1947 version for Musicraft anthologised so many times on LP; so much so, that I find it painful to listen to.And in any case, these performances have been remastered and reissued (2002) in asuperior edition, so there's little reason for buying this one.The total time is 64'34""."
4,An excellent introduction,I am a teacher of english in ukraine at a business institute. This book has helped me very much in teaching students. It is an excellent reference guide.
1,No evidence that it works,"All this book will do is give students an intelectual knowledge of the linguistics of English and help them take grammar tests. It will not improve the real grammar of speech or writing. Countless studies have shown that real language is acquired through comprehensible input (see books by Stephen Krashen). The other teachers who have written reviews may like teaching grammar, but they have no proof that their students' real language ability improved from working through the tedious rules and exercises."
1,Worst can opener I've used,This can opener was poorly designed. The cutting mechanism has to be attached to the can opener which is okay because it allows you to remove it for cleaning but there's nothing to lock it in place so it tends to slide out of the housing. Also the small rod that sticks out beside the cutting wheel makes it almost impossible to open anything larger than a small can of soup. Once you get the can in place it takes almost all your upper body weight to press down on the lever and get the cutting wheel to pierce the can. If you're lucky the can will rotate all the way around. Most of the time though it will rotate about an inch and then fall off.
3,Did not receive the opener pictured,The can opener we received was not the one pictured. The one pictured is an old time dependable standard. The one we received was Rival's modern version which seems to work for only certain size cans. Although it does have the double circular cutters. This far outperforms the cutters from other companies which have a combination of a punturing element with the rotary cutter. The problem with those is it is extremely difficult to get most cans moving around into that puncturing blade. The double circular cutters work much better.We would really have preferred the one pictured. We have had one for years and have never had any difficulties with it. Not only are the double circular blades dependable but also the bar on top gives much more leverage than the small rounded top of the one we received.
2,Disappointed,I bought this can opener because of the knife sharpener that it came with...Very disappointed with the knife sharpener and can opener. It is very difficult to open a can and the knife sharpener is not all it said it was.
4,Uncommon Traveler Mary Kingsley in Africa: an inspiring book,"This book written by Don Brown is a wonderful children's book. In this story, set in 1870, Mary Kingsley uses her childhood to motivate her travels to Africa. Mary begins the story as a child, who is taking care of her ill mother. Her father travels a lot, and is rarely home. Although Mary never attended school she loves to read and uses this to escape. Mary, now an adult travels to Africa which was a big accomplishment for a woman at that time. The book tells some of her experiences in Africa. Without revealing what happens at the end, I will tell you that Mary has many experiences in this children's book. She takes the reader through her life. The illustrations in the book help the reader visualize Mary's life. This is not my favorite children's book, but I would highly recommend this book to any parent or child. It kept my interest and it is sure to keep yours."
3,menu and special material,"I liked the movie and about that I have nothing to say, but...I dislike the menu. it has not scene selection! and the special material is pour. I would liked to watch storyboards and a making off... I'm a fan and that was a deception.I didn't put a 1 star (about the menu) because it has a great game, it's the best game to dvd that I've ever seen. really! is very fun and looks like 3d scenery."
3,"Overall, it's been a disappointment...","Some people may have thought that this movie was great. That's fine for them. I didn't.The pacing is choppy, the story is weak, and overall a very unbalanced Teen Titans movie. I just didn't see it having it all together like some of their greatest episodes.Think what you want to think about this movie. This is what I think."
3,"Not Great, Not Awful","I picked this up because I enjoy the Teen Titans series, but I was decidedly underwhelmed. There are much better episodes in the show, notably some of the multipart arcs, which made this feel average by comparison. Also, they committed a cardinal filmmaking sin by cutting away in the middle of an action scene and resolving it off-camera with little to no explanation. Considering that this DVD costs almost as much as an entire season of the show, it's hard to give it anything more than a lukewarm recommendation."
2,very weak,"This move was not terrible, I just did not like it,I have seen every episode, and the movie dose not ad anything,the story was weak, same with the action, I watched this on tv, and I would NOT watch it again!let alone buy it!"
3,The BreakDown,"I give:1 Star For: Price, I bought both chairs for $35 and got free shipping.1 Star For: Looks, nice even color, symmetrical, and beautiful rush seat.1 Star For: Expedient Service.-2 Stars For: Excessive Wobbling. Don't let you kids or heavy persons sit on this chair, since it wobbles. And it doesn't wobble because of uneven legs or that sort, it's poor construction at the seat itself. The square seat is joined to the legs in such a way that you should be wary about moving about when sitting on the chair for fear of cracking the seat away from the legs. I haven't used these chairs much at all, so they're OK right now, but I wouldn't trust them to last all that long with heavier use. But you get what you pay for, right?"
4,Just what we needed,"We needed 4 square bar stools to fit around our island, but didn't want to spend a ton of money for now. These are very nice-looking stools. Of the 4 I ordered, only 1 was a little wobbly but just putting the felt pads on the bottoms of the legs helped. Love how they can slide under the counter out of the way. I'm a little concerned about the 225 lb. weight limit, as we have family members who exceed this, but I guess you get what you pay for."
4,Cute Stools!,"These are really cute stools and for the money you can't beat 'em. The wood legs are a little lighter then I expected, but over all we really like them Perfect little stool to yuck under the bar side on our island. I would recommend."
2,Quality Problems,"Ordered 2. Order process easy. Delivery when expected, but 1-was VERY poorly assembled and I have had to re-inforce it twice now."
4,They're great!,I'm very pleased with my stools. They wobble a bit but doesn't take away from my decision to get them for my kitchen.
4,Great deal for 2 stools,"I just purchased the pair of 24 inch counter height stools for my kitchen counter and I like them. The quality is good for the price. The stain is medium brown. The rush seats are nicely woven, a straw color and they make a good appearance. They look nice, not cheap. My only reasons for not giving a 5 star is concern for an oversized person or a child looking to climb on one. I don't think they are sturdy enough. However, if you are looking for stools to have handy for occasional use by an average adult and don't want to spend a lot of money, they would definitely work."

5,Learn All About Judy Garland's Famous Shoes!,"This is a very interesting video that is entirely dedicated to one of the most famous pieces of Hollywood memorabilia ever: the ruby slippers from The Wizard of Oz. It is a very interesting story that almost seems like a mystery movie. Who would have thought that a pair of shoes could cause so much controversy? The video includes footage of every pair of slippers known to exist (including the Arabian test pair owned by actress Debbie Reynolds). Miss Reynolds was also interviewed for the documentary, as well as other owners of the shoes. You can also learn about what the slippers were made of, the man who discovered the several pairs of slippers stored away (Kent Warner), how much they have sold for at auction, and more. If you are a fan of The Wizard of Oz, Judy Garland, are mesmerized by the ruby slippers, or collect movie memorabilia, then I would definately recommend this good quality video. Very well done!"
3,Lightweight neck gaiter,"The quality of the product is excellent. It is lightweight as advertised. However, It is a bit small. When pulled up over your nose it squeezes pretty tight. After a few moments of use it will slide down your face and becomes nothing more than a neck ""choker""."
2,Maybe cool for a day,"If you like this game you stand alone, I was angered with this game for a few reasons. First they kill the story of phantasy star, and it does not have the enjoyment feel of the older ones. Secondly, it just isnt fun you flay the same levels over and over again. Eat the same food over and over again and eventually you cant take it anymore. Thats how it made me feel."
5,Once in a Life Time,This game is great! Sure you have to pay to play but it's only [price] every 3 months. It is one of the best games that ever hit the Dreamcast. It is an RPG but better. The best part is you go on to the internet get a team together and play through the game as a team. It even has multiplayier and a soccer game in the lobby. I'm forming a group as soon as I get the english version.
5,PAY TO PLAY?,"I was very upset (to say the least) regarding the pay to play policy for the upcoming PSO VER.2. I don't have a credit card, nor do I intend purchasing one. What about those who don't have credit cards or have preexisting credit troubles, or who want no association with a ""credit"" card? I have PSO VER. 1 and was looking forward to purchasing VER.2, but do to this unfortunate policy, I'll stick with what I have......*FROWNS*"
5,Virtuosic... Incredible,"You don't have to be a fan of the instrument in order to appreciate and become overwhelmed by the beauty, the splendor and acrobatics of the trumpet. In the Baroque era, it was a instrument for the royal treatment and heralded arrival of kings and war. The performances here are excellent- Hardenberger, I Musici and Neville Marriner and his orchestra deliver virtuosic renditions of Haydn's Trumpet Concerto in E flat, Hummel's, Hertel's, Molter's and Albinoni's concerti, as well as incredible arrangements of Ave Maria by Bach and Albinoni's Adagio."
4,Good LED work light,I bought this for my husband for Christmas. He uses it about once a week and seems very happy with it. It is very bright and it has no problems holding a charge.
3,"Simple, Effective, Could be brighter","I purchased this one to avoid another that was great, but didn't last. Was accustomed to more light than the new one produces....but I'll be happy if the thing lasts more than about 6 months. Compact, light weight, Flashlight feature is really handy."
5,"""let there be light""","A great product! i'm putting insulation up in the attic and this work lightprovides lots of illumination. the price is fair, and amazon did a terrificjob in making sure all the pieces of the transaction came together."
2,Too focused,Worklights should throw a decent spread of light. This is so focused that it's basically just a big goofy flashlight.
1,Cheap...not worth the money for sure.,I don't care if this thing had twice the LED's it still would not be worth buying. It is extremely poorly made and uses low quality LED's. The battery does not hold a charge very long either. I find it hard to believe it has a 1800mAh battery as listed. It will not get close to 5 hours of run time on a charge. More like 2 hours. The LED's in this light are not a pure white light like some higher quality units. They have a bluish tint to them which is really annoying.I sure would hate to drop this light on a hard surface. The LED board is not secured by anything. It is just shoved in the tube.The top LED's are absolutely worthless because they are extremely dim.Bottom line...this is a cheap light made in China that many companies slap their name on and sell. I would steer clear for sure.
3,SUPER BRIGHT 60 LED CORDLESS WORK LIGHT,"The product was delivered in a timely manner and everything was in good condition. The light is bright enough for normal tasks and appears to be well built. The problem I am having is the charge appears to last for a short time. I fully charged the light upon receipt, for 24 hours. I then disconnected the charger and hung it in the workshop. Within 5 days, the light had completely discharged and was unusable. I repeated the procedure a second time, with the same result. I'm not sure what the problem is but am planning on calling the manufacturer and discussing the problem."
3,High hopes - cheap product,"Had a good idea with this one - worked great for the first week - I am a master plumber and hard on tools, but the charging port broke after the first week - light is now in the trash"
1,I never got it!!!,I am not happy with this product because I never recieved it. If I did get it I am sure I would have been happy with it. I have been in contact with the person that I supposedly bought it from but I have not got this as of yet.
1,Horrible control,"The basis of any action video game, regardless of genre, is control. Ambiance, graphics, music, story, cool-factor, etc. mean little if control is an issue. Slower paced games can fudge a little on control, but a game that requires timing and reflexes lives or dies based on the control. In short, this game has horrible control issues. The James Bond license is handled well, but the game is an unfun chore to play. There are better vehicular combat games out there."
2,If you like Bond..... DON'T BUY THIS GAME!!!!!!,"I really enjoyed this game for the first two minutes. Then I realized, I should've kept those three dollars and bought a comic. This game has no story. It has the least entertaining missions. They are sooooooo pointless!!! Also, this title doesn't even live up to its name! There is no racing. All you do is shoot cars and people, save girls, and deactivate bombs."
2,"007 Racing, all it's cracked up to be?","Personaly when I took this game out of the box I was ready for some intense action and a challenge. But, when I started to play I was VERY dissapointed. The picture was very poor and the missions were extremely easy. I tried mulitplayer to try to get the feel and I also though that was extremly poor. So, I took it back to the store and asked for my money back. If you are looking for a good game this is not the one for you."
2,Never underestimate the power of the playstation,"Never underestimate the power of the playstation to mess up a game with a great concept. This game looked great all the way through the preview stage and must have stopped there because all the levels are extremely short and easy. The cars are fun to drive but that novelty wears out fast. Do not buy this game expecting to get a game like Need for Speed (eventhough it is made by EA). Expect more of a Twisted metal meets driver. Eventhough that in itself would be a good game, they don't even pull that off. Don't buy this game, instead buy Porsche Unleashed(psx) or 4x4 evolution(dc)."
1,worst game of the minute,"me and my friend just bought 007 reacing because we are both extermly rich. we have money everywhere but anyway we played the dumb, boring multiplayer in this game and got bored in about a second. there wasnt enough levels and they were horrible anyway. so then we played the missions and beat the game in about 59 seconds and we realized all the missions stinck. so after doing this we realized 007 racing is the worst game of the minute."
1,New Rules by Bill Maher - the book,I bought (mistakenly) essentially the same New Rules by Bill Maher - one on video and one on audio. The audio was without an audience and it had the sound of a rehersal. There was no audience feedback from the audience and Maher's delivery did not seem to have much joy or momentum. I keep everything I am buy by way of music or books but this went the way of a someone's else garage sale. In summary: BAD.
1,His Hand in Mine by Carroll Roberson,As you will notice on my order I ordered His Hand In Mine by Carroll Roberson and received a cd His Hand In Mine songs made famous by Carroll Roberson and I was charged more than is listed for the one I received. This was music but I ordered this for a friend who wanted the original CD songs Sung by Carroll Roberson and this is what I ordered.audio cd 5557841318 and it is listed on the order info that the cd was by Carrol Roberson and the one I received was not by Carroll RobersonHis Hand in Mine
5,Classic!,"What fun to read sci-fi based on 'real' science! Great plots, great thought-provoking ideas, and great fun to read."
2,Yuck.,"I got this disc ...the cover art looked cool so I opened it and pressed play.Yuck.Head Shrinkin Fun is a very mediocre recording by a very mediocre surf-punk band. Now don't get me wrong, the musicians sound accomplished in this style of music..and they do it somewhat well. But after hearing things like Dick Dale, or even The Ventures, this is weak in comparison. It seems as though all the songs sound the same to me. I just don't find much worth to this CD.2 stars for being rather dull, repetitive, and not as good as others in the genre."

5,Richard Feynman can really grow on you ...,"August 18, 1999After spending a good part of the last month listening to Richard Feynman's Physics lectures 1,3 and 4 I would like to raise my rating for these tapes to 5 (the highest possible).Richard Feynman can really grow on you as you become part of his Physics class of 1961 - 1962. The audio level is well maintained throughout the series which was a problem in some of his earlier audio books.I look forward to the University of Berkley California extending this Physics series continuously into new exciting topics.For the Physics faculty who may be following these notes the tapes are used nightly for my 19 month old sons bedtime stories. Two hours a night, every night.If your going to listen to something you might as well learn something interesting.Thank you for creating this valuable series.Arnold D Veness"
3,"Flawed, but Interesting","Nick was a strong, attractive hero until his plan for the rally turned to tragedy. I can't BELIEVE an author would have a strong hero do what he did - I'm referring to his course of action preceeding the rally. If he'd have just left things alone, everything would have gone smoothly because everybody in attendance was on the SAME side! I don't like heros who make weak decisions - it makes the hero weak and incompetent."
3,"Started Out Great, but Characters Changed & Fizzled","I loved the beginning of this book, Nick was adorable and seemed the perfect man. Lucy was also great, but as the story progressed, I didn't like how Lucy had to ""scold"" Nick; the reader could ""feel"" his embarrassment. Nick was not perfect either. His affection for Lucy was genuine and sweet, but I think this prince could have cared less about other people. The Selkirk family went out of their way to help him (they were kind of poor and didn't yet know he was a prince), yet when he heard they were in trouble with the law, he only wanted to know if Lucy was with them. He didn't even ask after their welfare. It wasn't until much later that he even gave them a thought."
3,I guess 3 1/2 stars couldn't finish book got bored 1/2 way,The beginning of this book was actually pretty funny but by the time I got half way through the book I was just bored. I finally decided to not move onto another book.
3,Wasn't What I Thought,"I found this book at Goodwill, and the cover and description made it sound like it would be more of a biographical book about Dr. Laura. However, I got 90 pages (out of 208) through, and discovered that there is little biographical information. Almost all of it is an evaluation of Dr. Laura's principles and whether they match the Christian Bible's principles.I am not interested in reading that, so I stopped. However, if that is actually the angle YOU are interested in reading about, it's probably a pretty thorough covering of the subject.And in response to the review that talked about biology vs. morality, and that children are now hitting puberty at earlier ages, I just hope that reviewer doesn't have children, because if they do, they will be unleashing an adult on us that is only driven by what they feel like doing at any given moment. We already have a world (and prisons) full of those adults. Please, we don't need any more!"
2,Unrealistic,"Dr. Laura has some interesting ideas on ""Abstaining"" from sex outside of marriage and keeping children in the dark about it. Her preaching ""sounds"" good, but her standards of morality are in complete conflict with our biological reality. In Biblical times (and even in our own timespan a hundred years ago), children did not reach puberty until mid to late teens (which generally corresponded with the age they married). Now, with better nutrition and medicine, children generally enter puberty around the age of 12 or 13. We live in a society that encourages education and college, which means that the age of marriage for most people would be early to mid 20's. That means that Dr. Laura is advocating that a person who is sexually mature do absolutely nothing about it for a period of 9 or 10 years! When standards of morality conflict with biological reality, something will eventually ""give"" and my bet is on the morality."
2,Packaging is awful - Stand is great,"I just put away my auto body tools after fixing the damage to my new (?) miter saw station. I'm inclined to believe the stand was conveyed to UPS in damaged condition: It only came from Carlisle to Bucks Co., PA; and I get at least two undamaged UPS packages every week.Was the weak link the poor Hitachi.TracRac packaging, or Amazon's disregard for customer satisfaction?? Either way, I need the stand, so I'm stuck with damaged goods and an unsatisfactory shopping experience.Now that it's back to its intended shape, the UU610 is a great stand - well designed - well constructed - made in the USA.If you're looking for a stand, buy this one. BUT, buy it somewhere where you can open the package and inspect it for damage (not Amazon).If you know anyone at Hitachi/TracRac, tell them it's time to send their packaging engineer to assisted living."
3,C12RSH mount on UU610,"Has anyone mounted a C12RSH on the UU610? I am having a problem. To get the weight of the saw balanced on the stand, you have to adjust the bolts on the toolmount handles and slide the handles accordingly. But, the instruction manual shows toolmount handles positioned 5 1/2 inches back from the front. So which is it.....keep the mounts in this position or slide them to balance the saw? Are there any better mounting instructions available?"
5,Really nice Stand,"I bought this stand a few years back on Amazon and am now reviewing it. The stand has worked better than expected. I have taken it on many jobs doing work with Habitat for Hummanity, as well as use it in my shop and at home. Being tossed in the bed of my pickup probably caused more damage to my truck bed than to this thing.I can certainly say it is built very well with strong locking legs, a sturdy top frame and arm extensions. I use my DeWalt 10"" mitre saw which seems like a perfect marriage with this stand. I was worried the saw might be too much for this stand, but I was wrong. It is surprisingly light weight for the sturdiness, strength and durability it has.I had looked at many others, and even compare it to others at job sites and still have not found one that I thought was better. This one today still performs as well as the day i got it. I highly reccomend this product."
3,Hitachi UU610 Miter Saw Stand,"First of all the instructions are poor. However, it's not difficult to figure the assemble out. I purchased the stand for my Hitachi RSH12C miter saw. The instructions list the miter saws that will fit on this stand. The RSH12C is not listed...bummer. I wound up making a plywood deck to attach the saw and mount to the stand. Not a big deal...but there is an issue with stability. I had to make an adjustable leg that mounts to the plywood deck in order to stabilize the stand and saw.All and all it's okay but I would not recommend this stand for the RSH12C miter saw."
4,Great Product - Ships with Accessories !!,Just bought the Hitachi UU610 stand (Tracrac). Didn't think the wheel kit or the entension stop were necessary. Guess What ?? Both add-ons are included in the box!! Isn't life grand....
5,"Slim Slams Another ""Home Run""","Watermelon Slim's 2nd album for the Canadian label, NorthernBlues Music is called ""The Wheel Man"", and is every bit as fresh and juicy as his hugely successful intitial 2006 self-titled ""Watermelon Slim & The Workers"" album. Slim's version of the Blues is just a little different, and therein lies the ""breath of fresh air"" that has him and the boys fast becoming ""Blues festival favorites"" all over the country this Summer. You can tell that Slim is having fun with the music, and that fun easily infects the crowd. If you haven't heard Watermelon Slim & The Workers, buy this album; as a matter of fact, buy BOTH of his albums. If you have heard his first album, I shouldn't need to tell you that this is more of the same refreshing stuff."
3,"The recording makes the music sound harsh, brittle, and compressed","Try as I may, and I have tried, I really only just like ""The Wheel Man."" The band chugs along, never missing a beat, and when someone breaks rank for a solo, one cannot deny the power of blending technical proficiency and combustion. Ringleader Bill Homans, who is, of course, Watermelon Slim, never slows down, whether yowling about his sorrows or his joys, and his one-of-a kind vocals do take a bit of getting used to.So what's wrong here? For me, the biggest issue is a severe case of what I have heard termed ""listener fatigue."" This recording just sounds harsh, brittle, and compressed, as though it was part of the musical fodder that is mixed and engineered for FM radio playlists---not like a blues recording--and that takes away from my ability to listen to the music."
2,Disappointed,"I listen to a fair amount of blues and was excited about this album based on the positive reviews. I don't like it, however. He sings with a lisp and the lyrics often seem off-kilter with the band. Perhaps this is just his style, but I'm not digging it. He does sound his best when singing the tunes minus the band."
4,"Great Product, But....","Yoou must be VERY careful to follow the size charts. I am a size 8 and had to order a size large, which is a snug fit. I was not very happy with the color selection as well (pink only). But they are warm and comfotable and I expect they will be very good for cold winter."
3,the lack of sizing,I bought these for my Grandmother and found the sizing is misleading. They are very snug for her so I have gotten her a larger pair.
4,Be careful when ordering the size,"I bought a pair of these for my wife and ended up giving them to my daughter because I got the wrong size. I know my wife has a 9 size foot but the shoe size tool on the page doesn't tell you what ""Small"", ""Medium"", or ""Large"" translate to in numbers. I got a medium and that was a 6 to 7 size. At least it fit my daughter's foot."
3,Sizing,"They need to be clearer about sizing. I ordered a large, but they did not specify whether that was 8,9,10 or whatever. When they arrived, I saw that they are 8-9. I wear a 10-11, so they are a bit snug."
3,car seat saver review,"this car seat saver is not good for an infant car seat, so i used it for my other child's stage 2 car seat and it is not the best one out there. it does not wipe down well either. it saves the seat, but that is about it."
5,A wonderful investment,"I do recommend this product to anyone who has young children and of whom you would like to keep your vehicle nice and clean. I have a 51/2 yr old boy, a 4 yr old boy and a newborn. The boys are wild enough and dirty that the protective seat cover is great. With the dirty shoes resting on the leather seats(just below the car seat), and the booster car seats themselves moving around when they try to get in that the seat protectors work wonders. Then, with the infant car carrier that would normally leave an indention and rub marks on the seat the protective cover does not allow for that to happen. Again, I do recommend this product to anyone who wants to keep most of there vehicle looking nice."
4,Tad too wide,This protects our leather seats well but is much wider than the infant carrier base which crowds the other passengers sitting next to the baby. Otherwise a good product.
4,Self defense for leather,"This works really well, and looks good, too. The belt for the LATCH system on my car makes the back buckle a bit, but the velcro problem of the earlier models has definitely been fixed. There is no separation between the two pieces at all, even after I belted the car seat in tightly.UPDATE: They make this in two colors, black and a light gray. The black color stained my light color seats, so I've since switched to the light gray, which does not seem to have this problem. Unless your seats are a very dark color, go with the gray color instead.Prince Lionheart 2-Stage Seatsaver - gray"
1,Horrible quality,"I just opened product to find a warning that this seat saver may discolor your seat in temperatures above 100 degrees. Mystroller charges a 15 % fee to refund as well. Not happy at all that the product doesn't disclaim the possible seat discoloration in the product description. Besides that it looks and feels cheap. I bought this one so I could use it for baby 2's baby car seat and use the the back for when she gets into a front facing. Im not gonna risk my tan seats getting stained for a 20 dollar ""seat protector"" that may or may not protect my seat Spend the extra 5 bucks for the kiddopatamus."
3,"nice product, wrong color delivered","I ordered the tan seatsaver, and they sent the gray. I am using it, but does not match the seats as well. The upright portion of the seat saver is too short if you use a taller backed car seat (like our Britax), so it takes a little home-brew adjusting."
2,Not TAN!!!!!,"Product seems like it works well, but it is green, NOT TAN!!! And the two pieces are totally different colors, not even close to matching!!!!"
3,"Great protection, but slips on cloth seats","I bought this to protect my light grey cloth seats from the stains and other damage my six year old is causing. It performs well in this regard. I really like the lip all the way around the base, it helps contain the mess. And the section that flops over the front really protects the seat from footprints. However it seems to slip on the cloth seats, so I am constantly having to re-position it. That gives me pause as to the safety of using it."
2,DOES NOT FIT GRACO NAUTILUS!,I have a Graco Nautilus and a Graco Nautilus Elite and this is not tall enough to cover the back of the seat. I have to undo the velcro in order to slide the top half up far enough so that the part of the booster seat behind my daughter's head won't leave an imprint in my leather and in my leatherette.The only pros about this seat saver is the material is strong and easy to clean and that the back is removable for when you use a backless booster.
4,Does the job with some interference,"Others comment that manufacturers recommend against putting anything between the baby seat and the car seat. For us, this seat saver doesn't increase the movement of the baby seat in the least. After three years of using this, the car seats are still unblemished and the seat savers have held up very well."
4,Seat Saver,"Saved our leather seats, just wish the backing was a bit longer to allow for more height. Easy to remove, clean and captures all of the Cherrios, goop, and other crazy kids stuff without harming your seats."
4,Seat Saver,"I bought two of the Prince Lionheart Seat Saver. They seem to be working great. My oldest grand daughter, sits in a high back booster seat. The seat is pretty much covered where it needs to be. She also likes to eat in my car, the seat saver catches most of her crumbs. The smallest grand daughter sits in a infant car seat. Before I got the Lionheart Seat Saver, I had to put towels under her car seat. The car seat looked like it was cutting right into the leather seats. Her car seat sits right in the center of the Lionheart Seat Saver, so I have all around cover for my back seat now. I do not like the smell of the Seat Savers. The smell is not over powering, it just has a slight tar smell. Finding the right seat cover for protecting my back seats, I am sure I did."
1,Not safe on contoured seats,"We bought this at a different retailer and used it with our first baby's carseat. Despite installing the seat properly on top of the the protector pad (putting my knee in the carseat and tugging the LATCH straps very tightly), the carseat still slid around a LOT.We ended up removing the protector and reinstalling the carseat the same way (knee in seat, tugging hard), and the carseat didn't budge a bit.Our car has fabric, not leather seats, but the seats are contoured. I think because of the thickness of the pad, it doesn't conform to the shape of the seat, but becomes an additional surface, which can lead to a carseat sliding too much.We ended up getting something else, much cheaper, for the back of the seat, rather than something underneath the carseat, and that worked great. I think using a towel could work fine, underneath the carseat, for some protection, without sliding issues."
2,what a pain...,"I bought this after my second child was born to protect our car's seats from the child seat. I have the original thin Prince Lionheart from my first child and love it. This one is so bulky with the built in lip that it got in the way of anyone having to sit next to it in the car. Also, the two part design causes so many problems as it constantly comes undone causing the top portion to slip down (thus defeating the purpose of protecting the seat).It does catch spills, but the original thin seat saver does too and actually does a better job. I have just recently moved the original one under my younger child and discarded this one altogether. I will look for something else to put under my older child's seat.I do not recommend this product."
4,Attractive and Does the Job!,"I went to BRU to try and purchase the all rubber Lionheart seat protector and they didn't have it. I was pretty much dead set against this one because of the ""professionals"" review. Well, (with help from the guy from BRU, we took this one out of the package and pulled my car seat off of the display. We then tried it out on the seat that they have available at BRU for just such tests. It was fine. I just installed it in my vehicle (Envoy XL) it doesn't have the largest seats in the world and this fit just fine. No, it didn't completely cover the back of the seat, but it wasn't made to. Most indentations occur on the seat bottom and the mid section of the seat. This covers all of that just fine. I don't know why the ""professional"" says that this protector is too thick...it isn't thick at all. Go to BRU and have one of their friendly folks do a demonstration. I give it 2 thumbs up!"
5,Great when installed properly!,"This seat saver really does what it says... ""Save your seats."" Because of the harder than most seat savers material, the seats in my cross over didn't even develop the indents that my other vehicle developed with the other soft seat saver. My husband even commented how he really enjoyed installing it and the security he feels with it for our twin boys. They don't budge and he even wish I had purchased these before the other two soft seat savers I purchased."
5,Much more than I had expected!,"I bought this seat saver because after having a car seat for FOUR years on my leather seats, my seats needed a serious break. I love it. I read some of the reviews on on AMAZON before buying this and all I can say is it does wonders. It does not skid, it catches messes, and more importantly- IT HELPS THE CAR SEAT SIT UPRIGHT AND SECURE."
5,Great product,This product works great in our car and no longer do we have imprints from the car seat.
3,08 Honda Accord,"The Lionheart two stage car seat protector will NOT fit in the newly designed 08 Honda Accord with leather. The protector is significantly to wide to fit the seat belt spacing and yet to shallow to actually allow the front flap of the protector to fold over the front of the seat. Also, the Accord seats are much to contoured to allow the protector to fit. The protector is stiff enough and thick enough that you cannot get it to bend to the contours or to allow access to the seat belt. I was bound and determined to make this protector work. . . but, it will not!"
3,Does the job,"It doesn't really stop the dents from getting into my leather seats, but it does stop the juice and crackers from getting on my seat."
2,Not what I was expecting...,"I didn't like this product at all. It gets 2 stars instead of 1 because some of what I don't like is personal preferance.In order to package it, they fold up the base which puts a crease across the whole thing that doesn't seem like it will ever go away. It is too large, IMO. And, it has a strong odor that didn't go away after letting it air out for quite awhile. And, the tan color was not the shade that I was expecting. I returned mine for a Sunshine Kids Ultra Mat, which I love. It works great, looks great, and doesn't smell."
2,Not worth it.,"It is not usable. The kids move in the car and with the kids mats move as well. The top part does not have any holding material so it falls all the time. Maybe if the car seat would be there it would stay up, but then you would not need the top part. The bottom part slides from the seat and the part where it should bend does not bend. My daughter is complaining all the time. the material is hard, easy to clean from crumbs, but the other stanes do not come out because of the gravel."
5,Works great,We have two of these and they are very nice. The raised lip keeps crap from going all the way into the seat crack. If you are looking for something to totally catch spills you should just get this: http://www.amazon.com/Waterproof-Tarp-10-Feet-12/dp/B004DEMFXY/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1354029769&sr=8-1&keywords=water+proof+tarp
4,Quality,"i LOVE THIS SEAT COVER AND IT PROTECTS THE SEATS IN MY CAR. i GAVE IT ONLY 4 STARS BECAUSE IT COULD BE A LITTLE NARROWER, BUT EVERYONE IS ABLE TO SIT. i READ A NEGATIVE REVIEW ABOUT THE BACK PART BUT OVERALL THIS THING IS PERFECT."
5,great product,"We have these in both of our cars. I feel that my car seat is installed even tighter with this product underneath it. I have a 21 month old, and the lip on this seat protector is great at collecting all the fallen ""snacks"" that she eats when we're on the go. We had horrible impressions in both of our cars after we took out the bases from our infant car seat, but using this seat protector with the ""big car seat"" has made all the difference in the world for our leather seats."
4,Little too big,"The car seat protectors have worked well over the past several months I have owned them. They are a little too big and interfere with my kids trying to buckle their seatbelt. I own a minivan, so if your seats are fairly narrow compared to the seats of a minivan, I would consider a different brand. Good luck.Ken"
1,Colors Bleed,"After installing the product, I found a small slip of paper in the packaging informing me that the colors may bleed and damage my seats if the internal temperature of the car exceeds 100F. A car parked outside during the summer will most definetly exceed this temperature limit. What's the point of buying a seat protector if they are going to damage your seat?!!!"
5,RECOMMENDED,"We had tried many other products before purchasing these one year ago (we purchased 4). They work great! There are no lines or pressure marks in the seat fabric once the car seats are removed. We recommend them to anyone. The velcro piece that holds the two sections together could have been better made, but we have not had any problem with the two sections staying in place and together."
1,Do not use!,I had a professional car seat installer put my car seat in and asked that they use this product. They explained that though it is a nice idea it does not allow the car seat to fit securely in the car. They recommended not using this product for safety reasons.
2,We just didn't use it,"We tried to install his under our car seat, but it didn't fit easily under the seat base in our small car, and seemed to make installation more difficult. Rather than risk it, we haven't used it."
3,Doesn't keep dirt off seats,"I bought this product hoping that I could keep my son's feet marks off the seat back when he's rear-facing. I know the directions say to use the bottom piece only when rear-facing, but I thought, ""Why not try the top piece too?"" Well the top piece won't stay on the back of the seat and doesn't cover a very big area. If the designers had only made the top piece a bit bigger and put some kid of strap or loop on the top, this product would be great for rear-facing. As it is, all it does is keep the car seat dents out of the bottom of the seat for rear-facing and bottom and back for front-facing. It is also a bit thinner than I expected. It will probably keep dents out of your seats, but don't expect it to keep the seats clean."
1,Impossible to get a safe installation,"After an hour of wrestling with this pad, I concluded that it's impossible to safely install a seat with this pad under it (at least a Britax Marathon.) I'm the father of a 48 lb 4 year old who likes to be carried, so I have both a lot of experience installing carseats and the strength to really haul on the straps. Yet, as hard as I tried, I could not get the straps tight enough to overcome the slickness of this pad. The seat just slid around on it, even when the straps were rock solid."
3,Prince Lionheart 2-Stage Seatsaver,"Good product. It does the job well.I would have given the product at least 4-stars for functionality except it doesn't fit as snuggly as I'd like in the rear seat of my '04 Acura TL, but that may not be the case for others."
5,Great Product!,"This is a great product! It not only saves your seats from the indentations that the car seats leave, but they also catch a lot of food from messy kids. My sister, my mom, and I have all purchased these for our cars and we all love them."
5,worth the money$,"I have leather seats in my car and truck and this is a true life saver. I have another brand that I had purchased when my son was born and it did the job, but after buying one of these for a baby shower gift and one for myself, this one is 1st choice. You won't regret spending the $20 for this protector."
1,Not safe!!!!,"My wife and I bought this item due to the fact that we have leather seats in our car. When our son was old enough to be put in a todler seat we took it to the state police to make sure it was installed correctly. With the seat protector installed the seat could move up to 2 inches on each side. The police told us that if we were in a accident 2 inches is alot and somethin severe could happen. The police took the seat protector off and the seat did not move at all. When it comes to your childrens' lives you do what you have to, who cares about leather seats they can be replaced."
4,saved leather seats,we have been using this seat saver for 16 months now and it has not ruined our leather seats. Every month I take out the (convertible) car seat and clean seat and re-install to do safety check and the seats are just fine. If your car seat is properly installed there is no way this seat saver will move around. My only suggestion to manufacture would be to make it a bit more narrow...it takes up more space on the actual vehicle seat than needed. The two-stage version is the only way to go.
1,NOT SAFETY APPROVED!!,"I purchased this seat protector when I bought another car seat for my daughter. Today I had my car seats inspected by the State of Maryland and the inspectors said that NO SEAT PROTECTORS ARE SAFETY APPROVED! Apparently the friction they can cause on a collision has not been safety tested by the manufacturer of the car seats. If GRACO, EVENFLO, etc., had their own seat protectors that were crash tested, those would be accepted. Since they do not, this seat protector cannot be used. Not only could it be a risk in a collision, but IT VOIDS THE WARRANTY ON THE CAR SEAT!! You cannot use any accessories that have not been tested by the manufacturer of the car seat. I was sorely disappointed since these protectors are very durable, and do prevent dents and damage to the seat. However, I'm going with the safety experts on this one. My child's safety is more important than the upholstery in my car! I am returning this useless item today."
4,Great for heavy carseats....amazing!,"After buying a new car, the last thing I wanted to do was to ruin the new seats. If you know anything about installing carseats, you know it has to be very tight. And after even just a day with a snug carseat, your car's seats get worn and ugly marks in them. So I bought this, and it worked well. After a week with a Britax Marathon snugly installed, using LATCH, the seats looked just great. The only negative thing is, that although the two pieces are nice; I wish they made it so the upper piece covered the top of the seats, where the top tether goes to tighten the carseats. I fixed that problem by undoing the velco, and moving that top piece a bit higher to cover. It is worth the $20 if it will save your seats."
1,Not good for a small car,I have a volvo 960 sedan and wanted to use the seat saver in the middle seat and it DID NOT work. The bottom section was too large for the space between the seat belt/buckle and did not allow the carseat base to be properly placed. My friend has one of those nylon seat protectors and it is much better.
3,"Helps with mess, but doesn't help with dents in seat",I bought this because I just got my very first car lease and want to keep it looking as nice as possible. Which can be hard with a two year old. It's great for keeping dirt and crumbs off the seat of my car. But it doesn't really help relieve the dents that his car seat makes in the seats of the car.
3,Can't use seat belts.,"I want to get these 5 stars because they really are great quality, but you can' use the seat belts with these. they are so big that they cover up the part on the seat that you click the seat belt into. You really have to bend or cut a section out of these to buckle up your child"
5,Life (and leather) saver!,"I have this in my 2011 4Runner, so if you're wondering if it covers an SUV seat, rest assured it gets the job done. The design is smart; the tub-style edges of the seat cover are currently protecting my seat from 14 hours worth of crumbs and accidental spills. Probably half a bowl's worth of cereal sitting in there waiting to be dumped, but the seat underneath is totally clean and protected. What more could you ask for? And the best part is the front extends over the seat so when my little girl puts her feet up they're not getting all over the leather.Look no further."
4,really helps,great fit in my 2006 Malibu and it helps prevent the car seat from digging in. like that its also meant for when the kid gets older. great investment.
3,Could be improved.,"I am hoping that this will be stiff enough and have high enough sides to hold accidents while potty training. When I sinched the seat down the pad wants to lay flat or buckle depending on where it's sitting. As long as the pad is all the way back it may work, but we'll have to keep an eye on it. What would be great is if the back sides went up a lot higher in the back and tapered to the front to make sure the pee stays in. A cut to fit shamwow pad or something would help too."
5,Once again saving my seats!,I purchased this item for under my first child seat 8 years ago and it did a superb job at protecting the leather seats. I now have 2 of these under each child and my cloth seats have been protected from spills and indentations that inevitably happen with children. These catch all the goldfish and crumbs that the kids leave on long road trips. I love these seat protectors and highly recommend them to anyone concerned with protecting their seats.
4,Great seat saver,"This thing is great. We have bought 3-4 seat savers over the years and this is the favorite. The bottom is thick, so it protects your seat from imprints and the bottom is formed like a tray to keep spills and food from getting on your seat. The one improvement, as others have said, is the back is a little short and doesn't go up the full height of the car seat. So, it will leave imprints on your car's backrest. Even with this minor issue, it is still the one I would buy again."
5,Prince Lionheart,This is a very good product. It is exactly what I was looking for and needed. They are great for spill protection and protection on your seats.
2,Failed remastering....look elsewhere,"Paul and David nailed it. Granted that the recordings were AAD, and done quite some time ago, the re-mastering of the Rodrigo and Ponce are execrable! Given the technology available to bring out the guitar, Segovia's performance is lost in the mud of the orchestra....which in turn has much too much volume on items like the trumpet. At any volume level where one can hear Segovia, one has to get up (or point the remote) and turn down the volume at other times.That said, the ""Castles of Spain"" is remarkably well presented. Given that it's an historical recording in Segovia's latter years, it is valuable to present it as he played it."
5,Uncut and un censored,"Remaster version of the most successful film in Brazil history. New York Video really has respect for his clientele. The image quality is optimal, taking in account the year the movie was released. It is in enhanced 16x9 Widescreen. The soundtrack by Chico Buarque has been remastered in Dolby. No scene has been cut. No censure. New York Video presents the complete Re-release version as was presented in Brazil. In optional English or Portuguese language with optional English subtitles."
3,What is all the excitement?,"I'm only writing this review because a lot of people seem to think this is such a great movie. I wish now that I had bought the Sally Fields version. This is very amatuerishly done in my opinion. It was made nearly 30 years ago, and if you want to watch an out-of-shape soap opera star run out naked, maybe you will like it. He wasn't comical, he was just repulsive. Had he been gorgeous, maybe I would have liked it better. Save your money and buy the American version."
5,Dona Flor,I loved this movie when I saw it on the big screen years ago. If you still have a VHS player go for it.
5,Dona Flor and her two husbands,An excellent but graphic depiction of the middle age crisis and the opposing pulls of conventional respectability and the pure thrill of being alive that rapturous sex provides. I waited 15 years for a chance to see this movie again on dvd.
3,Good Book.,"A fun, cute book. Didn't keep my kid's attention long. Not a great educational motivator. A bit too much fluff."
4,"Reliability and Variety in ""America's Best...""","I bought 2 bread machine books at the same time. While the other had a much more sophisticated format and general discussion of bread making, this book offers a simple direct format and specific directions (with aside tips occasionally) for a wide variety of bread types. The authors also offer, with good directions, the option of breads mixed in the machine but finished as free-form hearth breads. Of the ten or so breads I have tried, results have been excellent."
5,A must for everyone enjoy flying,"The book is written for the ground course both for PPL and CPL. Whether you are student pilot, ATPL or someone who loves flying, it is a must in your bookself. However, it's too brief for some of diffcult concepts in flying."
2,CRACKED JEWEL BOX,"THE CDs ARE AS EXPECTED. THE CRACKED JEWEL BOX WAS NOT. As the CD came in a well packed box which itself showed no signs of damage, I think it shipped with a cracked jewel box. This is the first time a product has been received which was damaged."
5,Great!,"To be honest, I only heard of this series a few months ago (heck, I finally beat the first one just before I got my hands on this one). But for anyone who has played the first, this is an enjoyable continuation to the series. My only complaint would be that the game is rather short (9 chapters all told, but all done in 35 hours). Other than that, the game is very enjoyable. The combat system works well, and the different forms that you get mixes things up a bit. A good solid game when it all boils down."
3,Average game (not bad by any means),"I did not play AI1 or AI2, but I've played many other RPGs and SRPGs in the past. Like the other reviewers, I would rate this game average. It's not bad at all, but definitely not special.My favorite character is actually an NPC that you don't get to play directly. The characters that you get to play have very limited character development. For myself, the story is everything in a game. These kinds of games usually require a large amount of time to finish. I expect the story to keep you intrigued and motivated until the end. Unfortunately, AI3 did not accomplish that for me. An average game."
5,Black panthers abec 7,bloody hell smooth a babys bottom.They got me going on a halfpipe up and down over and over i just kept going and very smootly as well
5,good bearings,"they are probably the best metal bearings on the market, not the best bearings ever but they are better for there price tag even though considering good ceramic bearings are better"
3,sk8poop,these bearings are fast and BUT they are pricey and for what i paid i expected them to last way longer its been close to a month and 2 already broke they shields were pretty cheap so the bearing balls came out
2,dont waste your money,the bearing were ok at first i HAD them for 4 years and i didnt use them for 3 years them i started to skate again on one of the bearings idk how but 2 of the balls fell out and them i poped one on a 3 stair so i got new bearing i recomend getting bones bearings any of them but the black panthers are smooth while they last but if u ride a long board there ok
2,Mediocre,About the only thing worth seeing is Errol Flynn's attempt at song and dance. He was good in this. But it's a rather disjointed story.The film isn't in very good condition either. There were many places where the film is badly discolored....at least on the VHS version....and several skips througout the film that causes you to miss some of the dialogue.
4,A terrible deed in 1864.,"Very little is known about this massacre, except that over one hundred Indians of Black Kettle's Cheyenne tribe were killed as they were co-existing in eastern Colorado. Some Indians were indeed renegades but not from this tribe. Early in the morning, a troop of mostly volunteer soldiers from the Colorado militia raided Black Kettle's village and killed braves, women, and children. They then mutiliated the corpses. Hoig describes the situation that led to the massacre very effectively.Hoig has written many other good histories of the southern Plains Indians. These Indians were victims of the territorial expansion of the United States. Many settlers wished them dead rather than supporting their upkeep on reservations. This shows the sade tale of broken promises."
5,another Tinkerbell winner,"My granddaughter loves Tinkerbell! She's watched this one so much that this purchase is a replacement for the one she wore out. Yes, Tinkerbell is a hot head, but ultimately, she learns the importance of friendship & teamwork."
5,My kids loved it,"My kids absolutely loved this movie, and request to watch it all the time. They also enjoyed the extras. Having a DVD copy for grandma's house was a plus."
1,WILL NOT PLAY,"I sent this DVD to my Goddaughter for her birthday. She loved the first Tinkerbell movie.She and her father report that it jumps around from scene to scene apparently at random and is unwatchable.I am waiting to hear if it plays properly on another DVD player.It wasn't the happy birthday experience I was hoping for.Very disappointing.We'll see how well Amazon responds if the disc is defective.Their DVD player plays other DVDs just fine, but in fairness we don't know for sure whether it's this disc or the player yet...but Amazon asked for this review now."
1,Damaged,"When I received this item the movie was lose in the case, the case was completely broken inside and the movie was all scratched up. Before this year I have never had a problem ordering from Amazon.com but in the future I doubt I will. I no longer trust the product I might receive. I haven't watched the movie yet and I hope it plays when I do - if not I will never order a movie from here again. We have seen this movie before and it is a great movie, my kids love it for those wondering about the movie."
2,"visually pretty, but so one-dimensional that I would only recommend it for youngsters","Many other reviewers have already given good plot overviews, so I won't get into that here. I will say that unless you have a very young child who would appreciate this film, there isn't much to recommend here. The colors are pretty and some of the animation is visually interesting, but the story is so one dimensional that it's difficult for me to imagine anyone but a very young child finding this film particularly engaging. The people working for Disney today should be forced to watch (and re-watch and re-watch) old classics like Dumbo or Bambi. Maybe if they did, they would learn something about bringing emotion to animated pictures. Unfortunately, TinkerBell just falls flat. It's too bad that with the improved technology we aren't getting commensurate storytelling."
2,Doesn't keep 3 yo attention,I bought this for my 3 yo as a treat but neither one of use could make it through without getting distracted and wandering away. What I saw was cute. But not sure we'll watch it again.
2,"Great for 3 Year Olds, Agonizing for Adults","Like all computer animation, this movie looks really good on Blu-Ray. It's rich with brilliant colors and detail. Unfortunately, just looking pretty isn't enough to keep your attention for very long.While young children--those under, I'd guess, 7--may enjoy this terribly written film, adults will squirm or, if they're lucky, catch a quick nap while the little ones ""oh"" and ""ah"" at the continuing adventures of Tinkerbell.While this bears the Disney name, it lacks ALL of the wit of the Mouse House's theatrical animated releases. Toddlers and preschoolers may enjoy the tale, which is filled with action, if not plot or charm, but it's in the creative category of what you'd find on Nick or PBS any day of the week. In short, nothing special. This one is for hardcore preschool princess fans only."
1,So Much for Disney's Magic,"Awful, boring, and overdone in the way computer-generated cartoons invariably are outside of Pixar.We used to love Tinkerbell growing up and it is a shame to see this tripe diminish the brand. So bad our 2-year-old wouldn't watch it for 5 minutes."
4,"great sequel, perfect for preschoolers!","The first ""Tinker Bell"" movie is by far the best Disney feature, or ANY feature (other than Little Bear) for toddler girls/preschool girls. Although I didn't like this movie as much as the first, it still delivers with clever dialogue, beautiful animation, and a strong female lead that is my favorite female role model for little girls. If your child has seen the first one and loves it, just keep in mind this movie is scarier -- more twists and turns, moments of peril -- and has more arguments/conflicts than the first film. Keeping that in mind, I think your toddler/preschooler will love it."
4,Great Movie for kids,Bought for my duaghter nd she has a great time watching this movie over and over. We are a big Disney family and this is a decent sequel movie that can be tolerated by adults a few hundred times.
5,Lovely movie,My kids love this - a boy and a girl. I even do not mind seeing it over and over again - as young kids like to do!
4,Great for the little ones!,"This movie was great on the kindle. Its a really cute movie. It was my favorite until the new tinkerbell movie came out a gew weeks ago. :-) Great family movie, doesnt get old when they are watching it in the car on a 5 1/2 hour drive!"
2,Not happy with sequel,"Very disappointing. It is not amusing to me as a parent to buy a movie that features rudeness, impatience, angry outbursts, and selfishness by the main character. Also, the 30 second commercial for this movie, which was actually really cute, was nowhere in the movie."
4,"Cute story, animation looks too much like a video game for me","I've been a Disney fan for years, and have enjoyed the classic, the newer Pixar and the films that are not animated.The PQ and AQ on this Blu-Ray are both 5/5. It was viewed on a 42"" Panasonic Plasma and BD35 player. As usual, Disney soars with its picture and sound quality, and it is absolutely spectacular in that regard.While the story was cute, and filled with Disney lessons, such as the importance of friendship & overcoming obstacles, the animation looks a little too artificial for me. The detail of the characters, is, as usual, detailed and remarkably whimsical, which was adorable. Of course animations are meant to overembellish, and make light of certain elements, but unfortunately I felt like I was watching a video game. I personally do not enjoy this type of animation, but still recommend this Blu for its value for children, and its overall quality."
4,"Not the best one, but it's worth buying","My daughter loves the Tinker Bell movies, this one isn't the best one, but we've definitely watched it more than enough times to make it worth my purchase. So grateful that there are several in the series - it keeps them from becoming too monotonous."
5,A Pleasure to Watch,"I am always on a quest to find G-rated movies to play in my dental office. I look for a movie that a 5-year old can watch without the parents being offended, while at the same time I look for a movie that adults can watch and be entertained as well. This movie meets those two criteria. Also, the animation is superb and the talent behind the voices is excellent. The story line is exciting. After viewing this movie, I bought the first Tinkerbell movie in this series. It is mildly entertaining, but not as good as this one. My highest recommendation for this solid family movie."
4,Parents beware...,It's just as entertaining as the last movie! My daughter insists on watching this at least once a day! I hope more blu-ray manufacturers follow suit and have every blu-ray include a standard dvd as well. It would've been nice to see what the bd-live is all about.
5,Beautiful Movie,"Beautiful movie for the whole family. If you also have the first movie, Tinker Bell fun is going to last for a while."
4,Not too bad...enjoyable,"I had the chance to review this Blu-Ray of Tinker bell and the Lost Treasure and I was pleasantly entertained. The story begins on the slow side. I watched this with my 4 y.o. niece and after 20 min. she left the room. So little kids will find it on the boring side. I continued watching and without spoiling anything I liked it more than I thought.Like:1. Pixar like animation, vivid colors2. Blu-Ray picture quality (Disney never disappoints with their quality Blu Ray transfers)3. Soundtrack4. Tinker-Bell (always lovable)Dislike:1. Storyline a bit on slow side at first but catches up2. Little children might find it boring...not too childish for an adult (though not really my type of movie)"
2,"No heart, no fun.","If you want a fun Disney cartoon for your kids...don't pick this one. All it does is demonstrate how Tinker Bell messes everything up, blames others, then realizes it's really her fault and so she fixes things even better and now she is filled with pride of her accomplishments. That's a bit too much for my 3 year old. Where are the songs? Where is the heart? Where is all the fun? Not blaming others for your mistakes and overcoming is great and all that, but that is the parents' job. I just want my daughter to be entertained with a fun adventure...and I can tell she is bored to tears."
3,Amazon doesit again,"I was happy with the product and the way it was delivered. I had a little trouble getting my card to work in the purchase but Amazon people talked me through it on the phone. They explained things in terms I understood and helped me get the product in a very timely manner. I thank you, Amazon staff and will recommend you to All of my friends."
1,the take home message in this movie is AWFUL,"It is VERY pretty, but basically what would a kid learn from watching this thing? That you should lie, convince your friends to steal for you, never admit when you do something wrong, treat your friends like crap & it's okay. In fact you will celebrated!Tinkerbell treats her good friends badly because she gets frustrated. She breaks a priceless heirloom and then un-friends a friend because he won't steal for her so she can go off on some crazy scheme to fix it. She blows the chance of fixing the damn heirloom cause she once again treats a friend like crap. She never admits that she broke the priceless heirloom but manages after the friend does steal for her to magically create something so fabulous that everyone is overjoyed.I hate the message in this movie. Hated it."
3,Missing Digital Copy,This version is lacking the digital copy version that is included in many other Disney titles. For the price it should have been included.
4,Kids Seem To Like It,"I gave this to my girlfriend's nieces & nephews to watch - they seemed to really like the story and the animation. This being a BD & DVD was nice since they could let the kids use the DVD in their own player but have the BD put back for watching in the living room. Great way to have 2 movies available for them to watch. This is the 2nd in the series I believe and the kids didn't seem to notice being out of order, but they did want to see the other ones after watching this. The kids were ranging from 2-8 with boys and girls and all of them seemed entertained."
3,not as good as the other two,"Of the three Tinkerbell movies, this is the last one my 3 yr old daughter saw. After seeing the other two, she was expecting lots of the 6 main fairies - Tink, Rosetta, Silvermist, Fawn, Iridessa, and Vidia. This movie is heavily Tink/Terence centric. The other fairies only have cameos, while Vidia (her favorite) doesn't have a single line. There's lots of frustration, crankiness and downright anger from Tink, which she works through and eventually feels remorse for, but my daughter doesn't really get that Tink is under undue pressure to save the ENTIRE Hollow. She just sees that she yells and stomps her feet and throws fits throughout the movie. There are some cute moments and lessons learned, so it's not an overall bad movie. I would just recommend the others over this one."
2,Just not the fun Tinkerbell we are used to!,"I bought this thinking my daughter was going to love it just as she did with the 2 other Tinkerbell movies. Unfortunately, we turned it off early. She really didn't like that Tinkerbell was not being nice. I read reviews by parents that warned me of rude behavior in the movie, but I bought it thinking maybe they were misreading something, afterall, it is a Tinkerbell Disney movie! They were correct in rating it low. I wish I had listened!"
3,The end didnt work,I love tinkerbell so much and im so happy to have the whole set finally. But i the end of this one didnt work. We tried 2 dvd players. cleaned the cd and everythign. But once it got to that part where she finds the mirror. thats it. Wont play anything else. It was very disappointing. Especially to the kids.
4,Kids enjoyed it!,"The storyline was pretty much the same as the other Tinker Bell movies, but the kids loved it and that is all that matters."
4,Fun Movie,"Not as good as Silver Wings, but still a great addition to the Tinker Bell saga. She enjoyed the film and watched it to the end."
5,A work of art,"This album is original work. People who only get the ""City of Evil"" album are truly missing out. A7X made this album at 17. a very big accomplishment for such a young age. I think that this album should be called one of the classics. You can tell that their influences played a big part, because it is obvious, by their sound, the compilation of various artists that this album comes from. BTW, they are the mystery guest at Ozzfest, go to Ozzfest and see them on the main stage!!!"
5,Groovey,"WOW! I havnt heard this CD yet but wow! what a groovey name! I like that name...im not exactly sure what avenged means...or sevenfold for that matter, but thats ok because there songs have lots of big words! YEAH! um...ok im done now. DETROIT ROCKS MAN YEAH!"
4,No identity!,"These guys have some real talent. They write some of the most diverse songs I've ever heard. One second it sounds like they're playing a punk song, and the next some awesomely-heavy metal riff starts up behind swat vocals and crazy drumming. Stylistic transitions in the songs are seemless and it doesn't sound lame when the band gets heavy and the singer starts screaming. The elements of punk, hardcore, metal, and some 90's type vocals are all evident in their music. There are some punk moments that go to good hardcore riffs that move to devastating metal riffs which remind me of Megadeath, Iron Maiden, and Justice/Master era Metallica. This album is Metalcore, with some sloppiness and not-togetherness typical of the genre. Really only slightly above average. I'd give it three and half stars if I could."
1,Matts in your hair and spandex are no substitute for talet,"If you absolutely MUST purchase this trend, weel-worn formulaic tripe then please, oh, PLEASE buy it second hand, prefereably from a pawn shop (where most of the copies will end up anyway when the used cd stores refuse to touch them). Also, purchase it only because you thought it was another band.A belly full of garlic and beans will ultimately produce a more tallented noise than these incontinent apes ever could with years of musical training (whenever that might be, in some possible future)."
1,a bad start to good music,"Im a huge a7x fan but this album is pure crap. waking the fallen is a much better album.i just cant find a song i like on this album and its like cancer to the ears. dont listen to the a7x fanboys that post there reviews here. if you wanna listen to something good listen to waking the fallen or there new cd, but stay away from this piece of crap it gives a7x a bad name."
1,overkill want their logo back please??,oh yeah..... stratovarious wants their intro riff backmetallica and iron maiden want their lead guitar back too please.as for the rest of the bandlol whats up with the make up ... ??
1,Someone please cut off their fingers and toungues!,"Wholely dissappointing and not unexpected from a bunch of wanker/poseurs. I hope they learned their lesson: That a bunch of tattoos, angry poses and their daddy's money are no substitute for talent..."
4,good CD,"This CD is good, but of all the Avenged Sevenfold CD's I own (which is all of them) this is my least favorite. Product arrived in great condition and in good time."
4,A gift to my Grandson.,I gave this to my Grandson as a gift. He seemed to enjoy it. It's one of his favorite bands. He's 17.
3,Was looking for the menthol version,"The picture on line indicated the menthol version of Aveeno lotion, but I got the non-menthol version instead. Very disappointed. However, the delivery was quick. I hope the return process is smooth too."
3,Wrong product for what I needed,The product was wrong which was an error on my part. To return the item it made the whole transaction to expensive. So now I am stuck with a product I cannot use.
1,This brush...,"So, I saw this brush on here and just couldn't help myself. After reading the above review I was SOLD. We it for our little kitty for her special birth day because we just knew it was what she deserved. Unfortunately I couldn't afford it and the bank wouldn't take a ""cat brush"" as an item they were willing to give out a $30,000 loan for. So what could I do? I went to a loan shark. He seemed like a nice man, but when I couldn't pay the money back a week later he broke my knees, kidnapped my wife and sold my precious little kitty to the local Chinese place. Now I can't work because of my knees, my wife still isn't back, I can't pay my hospital bills and now I am homeless. Long story short, this brush has ruined my life."
4,Not sure what that guy is talking about,When I purchased the screen protector is was very easy to apply and I did not have problems of a sticky residue. But I did have a problem when I did not read the instructions first.The real problem I had with this is that the screen protector does not 100% cover the screen. It is more like at 95-98% coverage of the screen so you have to very carefully position it in the direct center.
1,Don't waste your money,"Bookchin, a washed up Marxist, lays down a lot of nonsense about post-leftist anarchism, most likely motivated by the fact that few people are paying attention to him anymore"
2,Preaching to the Choir,"To me, this book is the work of a bitter old man. He seems to be making a pointless argument -- his vision of class struggle anarchism is outdated. Further, it reads more like an extended diatribe that latte-chugging cafe radicals could snap their fingers to, rather than something for outsiders. The strident tone of the book doesn't help, either. I give it two stars because it does help you realize why anarchists devote so much time to in-fighting. But Bookchin's age, this may be the last book he churns out, and it's an unfortunate note to go out on."
2,its a very good bookfor children,The little red hen's worst enermy was the fox. he always tryed to eat her. One night he chaught the little red hen. he put her in a sack. On his walk hom he was tired and felt like a rest so he went to sleep under a tree. the hen had an idea . She took her sowing scissors out of her pocet and cut throught the sack. she put a great big rock in the sack and sowed it back up . he emptyed the sack into the pot and saw the hen was gone. It was a bit young for me but it was good all the same.
1,Don't waste your money,"I should've known better when I saw how cheap this light was. It's very cheap. Everything on it including the base is made of plastic. When I installed it, it worked in the test mode. After dark, it turned on once after I stood directly underneath it and waved my arms. No amount of fiddling or adjusting the motion sensor has helped. Do yourself a favor and don't bother with this one."
5,Absolutely adorable!,"I have taught 1st and 2nd grade and all of my students LOVE this book! It's an easy read and helps them to gain confidence in the skill. My own kids (ages 2 and 4) have a blast singing the first part and then finding the spider in all of the illustrations there after...always saying ""that sneaky spider!"" This is a must have book for your own collection. Not only is it a classic, but it illustrates hard work and determination. Love, love, love it!!"
3,It's OK,"The Good:It's fun to see the story continue. The pictures are warm and pleasant to look at.The Bad:To me, none of the verses flow as well as the original.The storyline is also a bit awkward since none of the verses connect storywise with each other. For instance, it would have made more sense to me if one verse picked up where the other left off. However, after climbing up the wall at the end of one verse, the spider is climbing up a bucket on the floor of the house in the next. Then in the next verse he has been mysteriously transported outside to the porch to climb up a rocking chair."
2,Great Idea but the lines do not flow,"Itsy Bitsy spider is probably the third most favourite rhyme of most kids. The reason? The words have such a wonderful rhythm about them and it sounds so plausible! This book does away with that magic. The new lines seem to have been thrust to sort of fit into the same rhythm, there is no natural flow. To make matters worse the concepts are very confusing in places! fOR eg the the phrase ""off came the fan"", My son expected the fan to come ""off"" like his bandaid, not turned off. I wasnt impressed with the art work either."
5,Who Knew There Were More Verses?,"I never knew the ""Itsy Bitsy Spider"" song continued on. I have to say, the rest of the verses don't flow as smoothly as the original first verse, but I try to make it work. My 18-month-old daughter absolutely loves this book and requests it by name. She doesn't mind my off-key singing and when I am finished, she asks me to read it again. The book is also good for pointing out vocabulary words such as ""cat,"" ""tail,"" ""pail,"" ""sun,"" etc. If you don't mind singing, buy this book for your toddler."
4,pretty darn good,"After putting up with QB Club 2000 for a year or two, I sprang for this game and I am not sorry I did! Everything is ten times better than it was previously. The catching process is simple and realistic, the opponents are relatively intelligent, and the playbooks are extensive. There are only a couple of aesthetic problems: a. Did you ever play Tecmo Super Bowl for old Nintendo where everyone looks like they are three hundred pounds? Same problem here. Running backs look like offensive linemen. b. If you have a spread set and drop bck to pass, you can't really see the receivers farthest away from you on occasion. Other than those picky things, a great game!"
5,Crazy Football fan,"This game is REALLY fun! I have it and I created a season with the Bucconers and Made a NFL Record with the team, and W.Dunn. Awsome game if your getting it for you or something,I garentee that they will have fun with it.at first its kinda hard to control the pad;so,Have fun!!!"
3,Just okay,I rented this game and it was fun but Madden kept saying the same phrases. I really wanted to buy it but when I rented it I was disapointed. So before buying rent it!
4,Missing a few key things,"This is a really great book overall that gets down and dirty into tons of info on specific styles. The beginning goes over the basic ingredients and techniques, but it's the style chapters that really shine. Daniels has done a ton of research and complied a ton of data to break down exactly what goes into different styles of beer and gives a fantastic building block for designing your own version of the style.I dock one star for what is missing. There are no mentions at all of the fantastic beers of Belgium, or the American ""hybrid"" styles like cream ale or amber ale. I love his methodical style of breaking down the beers, and I would really like to see this applied to these styles, especially the Belgians! Also there are a lot of simple grammar errors that any copy editor should have caught that get a bit distracting. I'd say time for a second edition with more beer styles!"
5,Invaluable reference,"Daniels' book is a must-have for the intermediate brewer. Invariably newcomers to brewing start off with extract kits, which can produce decent beer and have the virtue of simplicity. However, after a few batches, the now-intermediate brewer typically wants more control over the result, which leads to forays into recipe formulation. Daniels provides a wealth of information that can help with that. This book does not provide recipes, but it does provide great information about the fundamentals that you can use to formulate your own recipes. I wouldn't want to be without this book."
3,A good Resource but Limited data pool,"It's great I've read it and refer to it, but the data sampling pool is so very small that it's almost a joke. Seriously, of a sampling pool of 7 winners 86% used Crystal.... wow that tells me alot... ah, but it's still fun to dig into each style when formulating your own recipes."
3,Craft Beers,Very scientific stuff. This is for the serious brewer. The information is a little over my head. Maybe in a few years of brewing this book will be needed but this is not for the beginner.
3,not too bad,The book has alot of good info but relates a little to much to the NHC brewing comp so you are limited to alot of that info. Some actual recipes or eg would have been good and some info on belgien brewing would have been good.
3,All these... numbers,"Admittedly, I've not finished reading this yet. The book is broken out into two sections: The first gives a rather thorough and dense description of each ingredient and its effect on the final product: beer. The second is a recipe section of sorts, that outlines many popular beer styles and how to make a representative of the style.I got into homebrewing to be creative, and make some ""great beers"". Then I found out about all of these... numbers. If you're looking for a book to read in bed, the first half will certainly assist in slumber. All of these... formulas, numbers, and science. It's dizzying, and I want to skip it altogether, but I'm sure there's great information in here.I bought this book to find out what hops go well together, what hops to use in each style, and other fill-in-the-blanks kind of information that new homebrewers don't quite have their head around. I've skimmed the second section, which looks more to what I'm looking for."
2,Disappointed,"I was disappointed with this book. The ""statistics"" on second round NHC recipes - which take up much of this book - are of dubious relevance. Knowing that 51% of recipes used Hallertau hops, 40% used Saaz 5% used some Cascade, and 10% used a bit of Munich Malt and the odd one used some wheat, or 30% used Bohemian lager yeast but one used some obscure lager yeast at ale temperatures with no lagering but still fluked a great pils doesn't help me to ""design a great beer""! There was some useful stuff in amongst the distracting numbers, so drop the pages and pages of meaningless tables in the next edition please."
4,Not a recipe book,This is an excellent book for the experienced brewer. It is not for someone looking for a casual how to brew book. It contains no recipes and no directions just good solid information on how to create or tweak your existing recipes. It is much more detailed than the style information contained in an BJCP definition.
5,Great Beers=Great Read!,"Great source of information for making high quality home brew. Helps with putting together your recipe including grain bill, hoping schedule, yeast, etc."
5,Great Book,"Ray Daniels not only knows a great deal about beer, he knows how to write, organize and design a great book. The first book anyone interested in taking the step from beer drinker to brewer should buy. A nice gift for your ""beer expert"" buddy who needs to back up his statements with fact. Cheers"
4,Great Reference that really needs a 2nd edition,"I have been homebrewing for 10 years now and once I got past the initial beginners stages and wanted to know of the the what's and how's in more detail, this has been one of my go-to references. Not only is Ray Daniels very thorough, his writing style is very clear and accessible.My biggest wish at this point is to see an updated 2nd edition to this great book to reflect the innovations and trends that have come along in the last 10 to 15 years. These include new hop varietals, more depth on ingredients such as rye and styles that were omitted from the original edition. For instance,as already mentioned by other reviewers, Belgium ales are very popular now but missing from this book. The last chapter on wheat beers entirely ignores Belgium witbier.Nothing would please me more than an updated edition to this classic."
2,Good for reference,"It is a very technical book with lots of graphs and charts. If I ever have any technical homebrew questions, I will pull out this book. I might need to go back to college and get a masters degree to understand it, but I do now own it. Until I need it, it will just collect dust as part of my homebrew book collection."
4,Great book,"I own several books on beer brewing but most are fairly basic. This is the first advanced brewing book I've bought that focuses mainly on all grain brewing. This is not a book for a beginner. It gets fairly technical and could be pretty overwhelming if you don't already have a good understanding of how beer is made. It does a great job of explaining how to formulate recipes. From calculating your grain bill to ph adjustments, it guides you through the selection of every ingredient. It also does an amazing job of breaking down the subtle differences of every different style of beer out there. Overall I learned a lot from this book and I recommend it to anyone looking to take their brewing to the next level."
5,Great book for advanced homebrewers,"Truly great book, I taught I knew all about craft-beer-making, but in this book I've found many useful tips & tricks for adanced homebrewers.But - this book is not for beginers."
5,A True Bible of Beer,"I have a shelve full of brewing books, some in Russian, some in English, some in German. This book is absolutely excellent in concept, format and layout. Ray Daniels not only knows a great deal about beer, he knows how to compose and design a great book.The first section of Ray's book covers the fundamentals of all grain brewing in recipe design and formulation. The second part reviews the most popular beer styles, and throws in a good chunk of history and excerpts from old books and texts, which adds some flavor to this great hobby.Best book out there on beer, a true bible. Highly recommended."
3,Good book but might be getting outdated now,"A very useful and informative book, packed with lots of great in-depth detail, covering a wide range of information from historic beer-brewing facts and analysis through to modern home-brewing techniques and tips.However, a substantial portion of the information provided focuses on 'NHC Second-Round Beer' and what (home) brewers used (or did not use) in their entries into the second-round of the NHC Competition. So much so that at times it almost seems like a statistical analysis of the competition entries. Given that the data is about 10 years old now and is focused on only a small sample, I do wonder how relevant that portion of information is now and what may have changed since."
5,Great reference,"I have read and re-read this book. Each time I formulate a new recipe, I find myself reading the chapter on that style. Each time I read it, I pick up some more information and that leads me to tweak my recipes."
5,Great Beer Book for All,"This book is great. It explains most of every step in making your own beer. Its technical enough to explain all aspects of the brewing process. But also easy to understand. I have blindly mixed ingredients from other books, internet sites, but i didnt know exactly what i was doing until i go this book. great learning tool and great refernece. Worth the money. Now I am close to the beer i like and I kn ow how to alter it to get it to the way i like."
5,Essential for Homebrewers (Intermediate to Advanced),"If you are an intermediate or advanced homebrewer, you should have this book. Period.I reference this book very frequently, particularly when it comes to brewing specific styles or rereading about hops."
4,Really good read,"Good book for learning more at the intermediate level. Lots of really interesting information about ingredients especially. My only issue is that this book hasn't been updated in over 10 years, and it seems like a bit of the information is now outdated, especially where Malt Extract is concerned. Otherwise, a solid book to add to your brewing library!"
5,just what you need,"After reading these reviews, and getting this book, I would have to agree that it is one of the few beer books I refer to often.If you spend time before each recipe researching the style and tweaking the composition, this is just the book for you. I love the graphs of NHC 2nd round grist compositions that show min max and mean % of each grain.The mini style sections of the book give a good history and discuss ingredients and brewing processes. I was unaware of many techniques covered in the book, and can't wait to try them all out."
3,designing great beers,"this book is a bit dated now, but still relevant. the author goes to great lengths to give history and such, and to consult old recipes. I was a bit put off by the whole idea of looking at the percentage of beers that had which ingredients in the different contests. that did not seem very helpful, and perhaps following randy moser's lead and having a base recipe and then a list of 15+ things you could do to a beer to modify it a bit, and perhaps even having the bjcp guidelines included, would be helpful. with the advent of the new generation of books, like wild brews and brew like a monk, i think that if each style gets its own book, then designing great beers will need to be redone for sure. that being said, though, the first section is very good, especially on breaking down some of the things like gravity points, BU:GU, and conceptualizing the bigger picture of how a beer should be. worth a read."
5,A must-have book for every intermediate homebrewer,"This book starts out with directions on how to pick a grain bill (or extract) to match different tastes and gravities, how to pick your hop varieties and quantities and the right yeasts to use. Then moves on to step-by-step directions for making beers in most standard categories. There are no recipes in this book, but it does give examples of what most commercial brewers use in their recipes. It also lists the ingredients that winners of homebrew contests have put in their beers. With the information in this book you should be able match any style of beer or make variations on common styles."
5,Flawed but still Outstanding,"This is the single most intelligent and entertaining book I've ever read on musical theater. Its only flaw is that the author's personal politics sometimes creep into the text -- still he admits from the beginning that his analyses are subjective and perhaps this is unavoidable. Still, each chapter contains such gems, such unexpected treasures of insight and understanding, and such a contagious enthusiasm and sense of humor. The amazon.com review is right -- it's the only textbook I've ever read that I can read just for fun -- and yet it's also an outstanding textbook."
3,Disappointed,"After reading the review from Amazon I had high hopes of this book, but I'm afraid to say it did not live up to my raised expectations. It is the kind of book people will want to at least flip through in a store to see if it's what they're after before buying. There was a certain pretentious tone in sections which I did not appreciate, and mechanics of theatre too often took precedence over character."
4,Takes you into time....,"A very new age sounding electronica album...not too far from Delerium. Highly reccomended.The only draw back is I could have used stronger vocals, but these vocals are good, too."
3,Satisfied,"I feel I got what I paid for. There were several places I could have chosen to purchase from, Amazon is very convenient."
1,So bad it's funny,"The sets, acting, and directing in this production are so bad that they are comical. It makes the whole experience of watching this production mildly painful at times. It is unfortunate, for the singing is quite good. This would have been much better as a CD than a DVD."
2,Disappointed,Recieved the Mobile lock and could not activate. Called Dewalt and they said it is a 2 years old product and not compadiable with their new system. Had to send $100 for upgrade. They will credit $100 to service later. I have to send back the unit to them for upgrade. They should let you know ahead of time - Need alarm asap now it will be a few weeks of processing.
1,Disposable tent,"This tent is very easy to set up, lots of headroom. Good for a day out of the sun. I tried to use it at halfmoon bay california this summer for the first time, the sea air sunk thru and soaked our pillows and sleeping bags during the night. One pole of the two was split in 3 ways. It turned out quite disappointing and a waste of money in my opinion. We had to throw it away like a used ziplock bag.. :(.."
4,time will tell,"i got these because our apartment is on the 3rd floor of an older building and i have a bench that can be quite loud when i am doing sit-ups. i put these under the bench and have been using it like this for over a week now and have had no noise complaints, so i would say that it is doing a good job so far. we'll see if it holds up."
4,great for under small pools,I got one of those small lounge pools for my boys and needed something under it to keep rocks and what not from putting holes in it. Pool pads are expensive and being on a budget I needed something that was cheap but not cheaply made. I ordered 3 sets of these. They have done exactly what they are suppose to and so far have protected the bottom of the pool..I would recommend these if you need to protect the bottom of a pool. also I think if you put double sided tape on the bottom they could be used as matting for the floor if you stand in one spot a long time. (they do slide easily on the concrete..)gave them only a 4 star cuz they do slide easily so if your using them as a mat for standing it could be dangerous. I have almost landed on my behind a few times from the matts that are around outside of pool.
3,Not Really Impressed,"Maybe they would be better on a hard surface, however, on carpet they just are not firm enough and have too much give to them to be really effective. Also, if you barely brush against the ends they come off."
3,a mat is a mat,"The mats give you a decent workout area. Otherwise, there is nothing special about it."
1,Tasks dont make sense,"This leap pad book requires kids to find a secret unlabeled spot on the page to get a clue which is just a number they are told on each page. At the end they have to press the numbers in sequence to unlock a safe holding a birthday gift. Both having to press ""who knows where"" on the page to be told a number, and to then have to remember them all, seems terribly strange. My daughter doesn't bother with any of it. I do not recommend this book at all."
1,bad choice,"We have had it 3 months and the heat just quit but it runs. 2 calls fixed it. 2 major parts broke and the repairman said he never saw that happen before. The vent fan is very noisy and it comes on automatically when it senses smoke. You can't turn it off till it goes off on it's own. annoying as many times it is not bad and just from a spill in oven or bacon frying, etc..."
5,BEST CD EVER,I can listen to this CD and not get tired of any song. I love it all and can listen to it over and over again. I also saw then in a concert and it was sweet
3,"Try our new emo, now with 90% less whine!","Pretty good. I actually own a promo-only advance copy, from when it was still going to be self-titled. This is for people who love the harmonies and deep, emotional lyrics of emo, but can't stand the whining. Stereotypers, you have met your match in Need to Breathe."
5,Daylight by NeedToBreathe,"This is NeedToBreathe's first cd. Bear's vocals are a bitter rougher than on subsequent albums, but it's endearing to go back to where they started. The songs are well-crafted and as usual, deal with real-life issues and some struggles. My personal favorite of the 11 tracks is ""Don't leave Just Yet"". It's one of those songs that would do well on a secular radio station. Their songs can always be enjoyed at face value, but when you really listen to what they're saying, it takes you to a deeper level. ""Don't Leave Just Yet"", while a reasonable request made to a spouse or significant other, you find is really a cry out to God; a plea for another chance, and an understanding of one's own frailty."
5,Uh-Mazed,"I initially heard NTB's first single You Are Here via Air1 Radio. Everytime I heard the song I found myself singing along. I checked them out on the web and found they have a MySpace page where I was able to download 8 of their songs. I know the otehr 3 have to be amazing, and I'm so intrigued,So I just bought this Album. Can't wait to see them in concert!!!!!! October 27th. OKC! Woot Woot"
3,kdo,If I had bought this CD first I probably would not have purchased The Outsiders (that CD is awsome)Just not the distinctive sound that Needtobreath has now.
4,Want to be a better person?,Then buy this album. I saw them live in a little club in Virginia on a Monday night and there was hardly any one there. I could not believe there was not not a packed house. If people had only known what they were missing...Bo and Bear are just awesome guys along with the other boys in the band. They are amazing on stage and quite sexy I might add. If you like up beat rock and roll that makes you just feel goood DO NOT pass up an chance to see this band in South Carolina or anywhere. And DO buy this album. It is a cure for any depression.
5,great book,This book is awesome . I love it the recipe are simple and really delicious ! I will defenitly recommend it.I also bought simple and simply delicious by sylvie rocher which is also great !
4,The Trail is Illuminated,"The 1973-1974 albums by Carlos Santana (Love, Devotion, Surrender, with John McLaughlin and Illuminations, with Alice Coltrane) were propelled from the heart and soul of the three artists; all were disciples of Indian guru Sri Chinmoy.Santana was stretching his vision of sound and touching on elements of a more ambient jazz than jazz-fusion, which confounded some fans and critics at that time. But the original music on the two albums continue to paint wonderful textures in a seemingly timeless manner.Bill Laswell takes nine tracks from the albums and sets forth on an energizing soundscape the fluidly floats, while channeling specific elements from each number. It is an aural canvas of pastels that accentuate the main ideas, rather than trying to create something new through the material.Santana had entered a period of tremendous artistic creativity and Laswell creates a mix that illuminates the wonderful trail."
3,Not For The Hard-Core Santana Fan!,"This was quite a risky move by Laswell. Reconstruction and remixing Miles Davis is one thing but Santana fans tend to be more devoted and hard-core loyalists that prefer their Santana original. The result therefore, is somewhat predictable. Santana devotees are likely to snub this work, while the more casual listener will find a totally new listening experience here, which in truth, offers little in the way of a true Santana experience. Tracks 1-2-5-6 & 8 are extremely well done and retain some semblance of Santana's rich guitar playing. Tracks 3-4-7 & 9, on the other hand, are, as one reviewer aptly puts it, filled with overly lush string arrangements that take the listener from Santana's creative jazzy arrangements to more of a classical feel. Bad? Not really, but certainly awkward and at times even a little annoying. Overall, it's worth a listen, but for my money, I prefer the real deal."
5,A true Worship Experience,"This is an awesome album. It is a blessing to you and a worship experience. Israel Houghton is a powerful minister and he leads you into a worship experience like no other. Every song on this CD is awesome, so don't fear buying it. I saw Israel and New Breed live and this album is exactly the same experience minus the visual aspect. I encourage every Christian who wants to enter into worship to get this CD!"
5,Exellent praise & worship cd with touches of salsa...,"This cd has a Carribean flare to it, with touches of Salsa, and traditional Gospel. A great cd featuring Israle's smooth vocals and an exellent backup choir in New Breed! Great songs such as You Are Good & Trading My Sorrows. Almost all the songs are upbeat and danceable(Salsa), and the words are words of faith!!! Awesome Gospel cd, this might be the greatest contemporary Gospel cds there is out there. It gets me going in the morning or before I get into the word."
5,a praise and worship must,this album is one of those press play and just let it go.Every song is a winner. If you are a part of the music ministry take it from a minister of music this is da bomb!
5,new season,AWESOME!!!! Talked about not just taking you to the place of praise but leading right to worship. I can not truly say everything about this CD but to GOD BE THE GLORY.
5,New Season is AWESOME!,What a RHEMA word! This is a refreshing CD and annointed! It is a must have for ANYONE! Get into your new season and buy it! I love it!
1,NOT FOR CHILDREN,"I bought this DVD because I thought this would be something cool to watch with my children because of the description. Boy was I wrong. I like watching the older ""horror"" movies with my kids ya know the ones with Vincent Price and Boris Korloff.. This was not that at all!!!Now when the description says ""grab the kids and turn the lights down"" as the openin line, you better make sure it's kid friendly. Once we were able to make our way through the ""menu maze"" we got to the movie.. As I'm sitting there with my 11 and 5yr old, one of the characters says ""Igor likes sex""! Um excuse me? Are you kidding me!! Who ever wrote the description was sure misleading.. If you have children, don't let them watch this!!!!"
1,Monsters Crash the Editing,"This DVD is so hard to navigate, it's nearly unwatchable, and extremely frustrating. The viewer is promted through a series of arcade-type mazes and must click on pictures within each scene to view chapters. Chapters aren't named, so even getting to ""Monsters Crash the PJ Party"" feature is major undertaking. In two chapters, ""Monsters Crash..."" shows while an old radio show plays over the feature. In two others, the viewer is shown still clips of instructions that are meant to pull off a gag stunt on a city-wide basis - - ""How to Bury Someone Alive,"" and something else. Neither stunt would fly in todays modern scene. Instructions could probably be found on the net in 2 minutes, while getting to them via the DVD would take more like 50 minutes.I used to think Director Ed Wood's ""Plan 9 Form Outer Space"" was the worst movie ever made, but ""Monsters Crash the Pajama Party"" has given me pause for thought."
4,someone better call a waaaaaaaaambulance,"because there sure are alot of crybabies reviewing this one! ;)something weird video, as they frequently are, completely and totally misunderstood and undervalued.that's a real shame.""monsters crash the pajama party"" is an idea. it's an inside joke. it's a lifestyle. you're either in, or you ain't.the TOTAL JOY of this dvd is that you get LOST.you're looking for one thing, and you end up someplace else. you watch things two and three times, totally confused and baffled that you uncovered the wrong egg- and it's a rotten one.tell me that you get it. please.you are in the funhouse, and you are totally LOST. that is the whole point.point the zapper and get lost. enjoy the ride. some of it is brilliant, some of it sucks, but, hello........ when you went to a triple feature, that is what you got! if you went to the drive-in..... that's what ya got! a mixed bag, some of it mint, most of it cut all to hell- but always a good time.bon appettite!"
3,Great DVD for a very select audience ONLY.,"First off, 99% of the people out there should skip this DVD. The movies are awful, and the 3-D does not work very well on TV. But if you are interested in the traveling spook shows (also called ghost shows) of the forties and fifties, then this DVD is a goldmine. A couple great interviews with ex-spook show performers, lots of poster art, trailers, and old instructions on how to make some of the effects. Getting to all of these features requires some bind clicking, but that is part of the fun. It's like finding secret doorways in an old house. If you have no interest in the bygone ghost shows of the middle part of the last century, then, by all means, steer clear of this DVD."
5,A mixed bag of clips and movies.,"The actual film on ""Monsters Crash the Pajama Party"" is but a short movie on the disc. Tons of clips, movies, slideshows and other items are scattered throughout the menus. It is a must buy DVD and great for a movie night or a kids night."
4,Radio Spots,"Here's a list of the radio spots and drive-in announcements on this DVD: Monsters Crash The Pajama Party, Monsters A Go-Go, The Horror Chamber Of Blood And Gore, The Brainiac/The Curse Of The Crying Women, Nightmare Of Movie Monsters, The Crawling Thing/The Creature Of Evil, The Trial Of The Dead, The Teenage Psycho Meets Bloody Mary, Man Buried Alive, 2 promos for Dr. Evil And His Terrors Of The Unknown, The Maniacs Are Loose, Asylum Of The Insane, The Man And Monster/The Bloody Vampire, The Crawling Thing From Planet 13, Garganta The Giant Gorilla Of The Universe, Kara Kum Spook Show, and Dr. Satan's Shrieks In The Night."
4,Good ol' Fashioned Cheesy Halloween Fun!!!,"I received this in the mail on Halloween today, which is perfect timing. This DVD was a bizarre trip back to the 60's with over-acting and classic Grindhouse moments. From being hypnotized to a 30-minute movie called Monsters Crash the Pajama Party. A 'mad doctor' turn women into gorillas. You also get a 60's horror movie called 'Tormented' Throughout the dvd menu, you can find crappy 3D clips, a tour thru a haunted ride with cheesy-lookin' monsters, classic music like the Boogie-Woogie Man, dancing skeletons, ghosts looking like sheets, a short film of a man at a drive-in theater turning into a Werewolf, and much more. If you want classic cheesy Halloween fun, you'll love MONSTERS CRASH THE PAJAMA PARTY: SPOOK SHOW SPECTACULAR!!!"
2,No 3-D glasses???,Was very let down when we opened the plastic wrap on the DVD to find NO 3-D glasses anywhere in the case? Kids were very disappointed too. Junk...
2,Great Content - Lousy DVD Authoring,"I love most of the stuff on this DVD... the vintage halloween themed musical shorts and film clips from 1920's-1960's. Unfortunatly, 99% of it is ruined by a badly placed SWV logo, and the 3-D part is a joke, its just some kids playing catch with a football...wow! Also, the menus are hard to navigate, and some of the pictures dont highlight properly and you cant tell what is being selected (on a jvc player). If it didnt have the logo all the time, and the menus worked properly, I'd give it 5 stars."
2,love the pattern-product not so much,"I saw these and had to have them and purchased two. Sadly, with normal, ordinary use both broke in several pieces not long after putting them into use. I have to say I was very disappointed. This is not the first of this product I have bought to use in my car's cupholders and I am not careless with their use. I can see one breaking, but both broke within a day of each other."
1,Not a good replacement for Joukowsky.,"Although the authors were knowledgeable, they were not anywhere near the writer that she was. It is long winded and at times dificult to follow. It is a shame that Joukowsky's book is now out of print."
2,"This book was informative, but at times it was long-winded.","The book had enough facts, figures and information to be a valid source of knowledge for the topic, however it was at times hard to follow. The statistics were thrown out at the reader without any preparation or easing into the introduced subject. It went from one topic to another without a smooth transition. Their transitions were choppy, leaving the reader feeling unsettled and at times, confused."
1,It's not clear how this book stacks up ...,"I have read ""A Complete Manual of Field Archaeology"" by Martha Joukowsky, ISBN= 0-13-162164-5 and 0-13-162156-4 (pbk). It is now out of print. I wish some bona fide expert could comment about the Hester book as a replacement for Joukowsky."
4,IMPERIAL OFFERING,"She is real. Just an everyday person at the nexus of oppurtunity, Belinda sings with emotion. Happy and satisfied, her work is so inspirational it leaves one in awe. Every time I flunk a test, I just think of her and life gets better again."
5,This album is classic... an unforgettable reference from late 80s...,I'm waiting anxiously for a new 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION REMASTERED that MUST be released by Virgin Records still next year.Check out new tracklist:01. Heaven is a Place on Earth02. Circle in the Sand03. I Feel Free04. Should I Let You In?05. World Without You06. I Get Weak07. We Can Change08. Fool For Love09. Nobody Owns Me10. Love Never Dies11. In My Wildest Dreams (b-side)12. Dancing in the City (b-side)13. Private Lives (previously unreleased)14. Some Hearts (previously unreleased)15. Out Of My Hands (previously unreleased)16. Waiting For A Star To Fall (previously unreleased)17. Love Like Heaven (previously unreleased)18. I Get Weak (extended version)Let's hope that MCA/Virgin Records attend us finally after a lot of years waiting for this comemorative CD edition.
4,"Heaven is a place on ""Belinda"".","When this was released I had such a crush on ""Belinda Carlisle"", ok so I still do. This album which was her most popular, is just as good as her ""Greatest Hits"" as far as I'm concerned. Included are the hits ""I Get Weak"", ""Circle In The Sand"", and of course ""Heaven Is A Place On Earth"", but I also like ""World Without You"" and ""Love Never Dies"". Plus there's her cover of ""I Feel Free"", which is obviously more pop than the original from ""Cream"". Overall this album is one of the best from the late 80's pop scene, and definitely the best of ""Belinda""."
1,Not Heaven on Earth,"Bought this on Mp3...I didn't realize that you have to pay a fee for Cloud player too, so I didn't get this on my Kindle. Wasted $9.99 on this."
2,"It's not a poem, no matter what the cover says","Why do I despise this book? Bad marketing. Had it been marketed as a retelling of a Native American creation myth, hand-bound and illustrated and in general a gorgeous piece of the chapbook-maker's craft, I'd probably have liked it despite my general dislike of Kyger. Sure, the pacing is pedestrian and the language is unexceptional, but we need more retellings of various cultures' creation myths to draw on. (I'm serious about this, I can't get enough of them.) But was it marketed that way? Of course not. This... is a LONG POEM! Uh, sorry, no. It's not a poem, and in all honesty it's not all that long, either; I got through it in about half an hour. And while reading about Coyote and his propensity for flinging vulture feathers about is right up my alley, a good bit of remarketing is needed here. And a rewrite probably wouldn't hurt. ""The people began to walk around and find things to eat/ For now they could see."" Uh, yeah. Pass the salt, please."
5,"awesome metal, great mosh music","worth every penny, i dont think there is one song on here i dont like."
5,I saved 50% at the grocery store,"This book was so easy to read. There were many great ideas for saving money. I planned out what foods I would need for a year. The blank meal planning sheets were invaluable for this project. I went to the grocery store with list and coupons in hand. I bought most foods on sale with coupons, I literally cut my food bill in half. I also found the lists of how long food could be stored helpful. As a working mother, I found this book to be a great resource. I have recommended it to everyone I know. Buy it. You won't be disappointed."
4,recieved product on time and as advertised. I would buy from seller again.,DVD has seams to have auto start up problems. It can't be in computer when starting. once you have it going it works fine.
1,not that great,"Aveeno lotion is expensive and doesn't moisturize as well as other brands. I found myself having to apply it over and over too often, unlike Vaseline Intensive Care or St. Ives."
4,Schwung und gute Laune,"ein guter Einblick in den Swing-Jazz der 20er und 30er Jahre, gibt Schwung und macht gute Laune. Hervorragende Besetzung mit Größen wie Johnny Hodges, Harry James oder Zutty Singleton et al."
3,This may NOT be what you are expecting - BUT...,"IF you buy Renaissance to hear the vocal artistry of Annie Haslam, this CD is not for you. She's been replaced by Stephanie Adlington who is a very talented singer, just different. She's got all the passion of Annie, just not the strength or range. Dunford is at the top of his form. Old time fans will enjoy the new scoring on the classic tracks.This group has been in transition since they were the Yardbirds in '69. This is the latest incarnation."
4,Some wonderful music on here...,"This doesn't have Annie Haslam on it, but that's why it's called ""Michael Dunford's Renaissnace"". The singer has a great voice and does a very nice job on the older songs. The production and musicianship are also top notch. It shouldn't be written off simply because Annie is not on it."
1,Wrong Title,"Track 12 is ""So Blase"". Should have been the title track to this album. The only song that Ms. Addlington does any justice to is the new track ""Don't Talk"". Very disappointing. Go get Annie Haslam's solo albums - you'll enjoy ALL of them. Not this one."
5,Great for felting,"Paton's is my go-to yarn for felting projects. It's a good quality product,with many lovely colors and blends. It's texture and hand are pleasing, the price is right, and now that I've used it multiple times, it's possible to predict the percentage of shrinkage. I use it for things that I make for myself, and also for items that I sell at my booth at the local arts center. Highly recommended."
4,Bleak future,"This novel pictures a world facing the rising sea with the resulting decline of the land mass. It based in the middle of the 21st century Australia. The unemployed form more than half the population and they are massed in specially built high rise towers and kept there by the police and the army. The story traces the fall of a family from sweet (i.e. employed with reasonable income) into the hell of unemployment.the story from the viewpoint of four main characters and more minor ones. While this may seem confusing at first, the author managed to turn this into an interesting way of examining different personalities each with its own selfish motive and self centered view of the world. this one of the best novels of what I call ""Future fiction"" as opposed to authentic science fiction"
4,Australian SF Reader,"A really interesting look at our current society falling apart due to the weather, etc. For a pleasant change, not set in 'ho-hum, not New York again, who the hell cares about there for the nth time', but in Melbourne. The characters seem real.After a woman loses her job, and her husband, she tries to get by. One honorable man tries to organise people to help each other out."
5,Woman's Day Book of Designer Crochet,"I fell in love with this designer's work from back in the 70's when she had patterns in Woman's Day magazines.And she's a 'sister' too!!Over the years, I wished I had gotten her book.So glad it was available online!"
5,This book should be part of education in schools,"Excellent book, a must read for those seeking the truth and God. I wish all the knowledge from this book was available to me when I was in the elementary school, so I would know the truth from early age."
5,Interesting book,"overall, it's a good book on comparative religion...the first 2 or 3 chapters alone are worth reading...the more detailed chapters on krishna, buddha, and jesus were a little too academic for me, but nonetheless interesting"
5,On Acharya S (With A Bit On Thomas Jefferson),"Jesus Christ, Acharya S is hot! Damn! Hotter than hell! Hotter than the deified sun!Okay, I'll probably burn in hell for that one...As for the book, I just wanted to attempt to accurize a commonly 'bawdlerized' quote from Thomas Jefferson, located on page 372. Based on my research, the actual quote should be:""Difference of opinion is advantageous in religion. The several sects perform the office of a Censor morum over each other. Is uniformity attainable? Millions of innocent men, women and children, since the introduction of Christianity, have been burnt, tortured, fined, imprisoned: yet we have not advanced one inch towards uniformity. What has been the effect of coercion? To make one half the world fools, and the other half hypocrites. To support roguery and error all over the earth.""[from Notes on the State of Virginia, Query XVII]Okay, now off to church!"
1,Do your own research and draw your onw conclusions!,"She assumes way way way too much information. As one of the other reviewers has said ""As terrible as this book is the real horror is the positive reviews of it."" Please people don't gobble up every bit of garbage you see take the time to taste it before you swallow.I beg all of you who read this book to take one of these religions and do your own research. Do not allow someone else to make such weighty claims for you. Please, I beg you!"
1,Suns of God attacks the Son of God!,"The author of this book clearly does not understand the Bible. In the book, the author misrepresents the data regarding textual variants in the Bible. This false information is then used as an attack against the Bible and the Son of God as revealed in the Bible. Avoid this book and the deception that lies within it's pages."
4,Peter McMahon,"From the first page of this well researched and extensively referenced work, I was gripped.The author demonstrates the common roots of three of the major belief systems through material that anyone with the inclination, can cross reference. That,to me, is what seperates this work from others. I would heartily reccomend it to anyone who has an interest in history or religion."
3,Very good but...,An interesting subject-- how modern religions came from earlier sun worship. The author is as dogmatic as any religious person and even when the topic is Buddha or Krishna brings the subject back to her own rant against Christianity. The book also attributes too much to the cult of the sun. Marduk was the planet Mercury-- not the sun. Molech was clearly Saturn and the morning star is Venus. Anyone who has done any naked eye astronomy would know Venus is the morning star and ancient people would have no reason to think of the sun as a star. Venus was extremely important to the indiginous people of America. The fact that various heavenly bodies figured in these beliefs suggest a pantheon of deities and not the monotheism of a single solar god. The author has an atheistic agenda and wants to show that the concept of God is primitive solar worship.
1,front end submerges quickly,"We took this out with our ski boat and the front end immediately submerged under water. I read the other review on this product and although they made it work for them, I don't see why anyone should modify their body position to adjust for a poorly designed product. I would definitely not buy this again. On the upside... Amazon customer service is amazing. It was so easy to return this and we quickly received our refund. Bravo Amazon - we buy from you because of your great customer service. Thank you!"
3,Wish All clad had a crepe pan,"If you have ever used an allclad cookware, this will be a disappointment. Heat capacity is just not as good. With all clad, I heat the pan at medium heat and then reduce the heat to low. This pan will cool down when you reduce the heat...means you have to cook at high heat...means prone to burning, etc. I am going to return mine...and use a 10"" all clad fry pan instead."
3,Excellent music and video marred by poor encoding,"I have another music and high places DVD done by the Goo Goo dolls. On all my DVD players I found a lot of compression artifacts (blocks, jumping, etc.) That DVD stopped functioning altogether and I figured I just had a bad DVD.This DVD shows the same compression artifacts. Lots of blocks with fast movement or scene changes. It is a real shame because the music and settings are wonderful. But I can't watch the DVD without extreme frustration caused by poor encoding. This happens on multiple DVD players for me. This Collective Sole DVD plus the Goo Goo Dolls music in high places are the only DVD's I have that do this."
2,"Collective Soul in Morocco, don't go back.",This was not a very interesting video and the music was lacking. I watched it once and I have no desire to even give it one more try.
3,Its not what I thought...,"My partner bought this, I had no idea what it was and I loved it, a feast for the eyes and ears. I smiled the whole way through. Awesome band, awesome songs, beautiful country. The next bit is His review...I'm sorry the acoustic version didn't do it for me.It doesn't matter who the band is I prefer them to be plugged in not unplugged. I should have read the description more closely. I do have their 7 Year Itch cd and I absolutely LOVE it. Maybe a greatest hits dvd with original videos might come out in the near future - here's hoping."
4,Very pleasant DVD,Very nice DVD of Collective Soul. As a big CS fan I was very interested in getting a DVD of them performing their music. Only slight negative was the lack of their formal electric based equipment (which is fully noted on the DVD description). The acoustic versions are nice but don't have the punch of the full band based versions. I still recommend - can't go wrong for $9.99.
2,Disappointing,"This book is by renowned paper piecer Carol Doak. Her work and CD block collections are usually pretty great. I admit, though, I was disappointed in this book. Most of the projects were too fussy for my taste and too adult. The block which is supposed to be a duck... Looks like a swan. The block which has teddy bears doesn't look so hot either. About the only quilt I liked was the hot air balloon... But I'm not running out to make it either.Overall, this was an average book, but nothing really excited me."
3,Great idea maker,"I didnt' think the quilts in this book were very ""baby"" like at all. I didn't like the colors chosen for practically all the quilts, however, that is easy to change. The paper piecing is very fun, fast and easy to work with though. I did get a few ideas from this book but I don't think I will be making any of these quilts for any babies."
5,Perfect for the novice researcher!,I found it to be a very useful tool in preparation for research interviews for my doctoral study. It is a 'guide' so if you are looking for more in-depth information then you should search for a text focusing more on theory.
4,Helpful and Informative Book,I recommend this product to anyone using the technique of interviewing for qualitative research or anyone interested in qualitative research
5,don't miss it,"The sound is muffled deep and feathery with his soft acoustic guitar, like Nick Drake, is a true master of this craft, but not so lonely, it is sexy tender and warns your heart. The tempos slow and meandering with strangely lovely kind of bleak, like Leonard Cohen, but not so sad, it is more delicate and filled with story and imagine. You don't have to understand what he sings, because it is too beautiful to feel more."
1,wrong item recevied,"I am not happy, ordered the Fantasia by Eendi the Red version but I got the green one instead ."
2,It was really good UNTIL....the pattern emerged....,"Well, I actually really liked the rain effect for this one, until I noticed five minutes into it that the raindrops...especially the up close, big sounding drops created a pattern every 15 seconds! If you've ever tried to fall asleep next to a dripping faucet it really is impossible! I fast forwarded through the entire hour and 20 minutes and sure as can be...the pattern was through the entire piece! First off....are you KIDDING ME? Come on! The people who put this together obviously either didn't put any effort into creating this, or think the audience is stupid. I was very disappointed in this purchase, because now I won't be able to listen to it ever again w/o hearing the darn pattern. It not only did NOT help me sleep after recognizing this, but KEPT ME AWAKE! Come on people...be a little more informed about your work. I do not recommend this cd. I did however also purchase some of Thom Brennan's ""Mist"" CD...which was very nice to listen to."
3,I like them hotter,"The All Stars really cook when salsa meets juju. Although this occurs infrequently on the new album, when it does, the percussive-horn sound will transport any listener.I found for the best listening experience, little bites of the All-Stars works best. So throw it into the changer as part of a bigger music experience and enjoy."
1,Left a lot to be desired....,"This book was an angry rant about men with whom the author had personal relationships...and felt they all didn't measure up.I kept looking for specifics, suggestions that other couples could use, or even a little empathy for the men. What they got instead was her ridicule.ED is a difficult condition, for both men and those who love them. There are numerous therapies and interventions, both medical and psychological, that can be used effectively to increase pleasure and satisfaction during love making. This author didn't mention any of them."
3,The Bagpipes & Drums of Scotland,"This contains a very wide range of pipe and drum music that have made the Scot's famous. If you are a pipe and drum fan and if this type of music gives you goosebumps and stirs the soul, then I recommend this.J KingGySgt USMC (Ret)"
4,Well Rounded CD,"If you're looking for a CD with a recording of Rodrigo's famous guitar concerto, this is a great buy. The additional tracks are nearly as enjoyable as the Rodrigo piece. I'm no fan of classical guitar, and rightly so, but this CD does make a compelling argument for the genre."
4,Quite an enjoyable little game,"""Star Wars: Demolition"" certainly blazes no new ground in the gaming or Star Wars universes, but it sure is a lot of fun to play. One has to appreciate the absurdity of the premise and the locales of battle. Basically, Jabba has decreed that a number of members of the Star Wars Universe battle it out in a gladiator-like tournament for the right to not be killed. This leads to some very bizarre matches and even stranger combatants. Anyone (or thing) from Boba Fett to an AT-ST to a rancor can be used as a combatant. The battle grids take place in such disparate locations as Tatooine, Naboo, Dagobah, and THE DEATH STAR(!), to name a few. The gameplay, itself, is not the smoothest, but it is still a very fun play. Try it on full tournament mode, and after using various different combatants to win, hidden combatants can be unlocked. It's quite fun and has a high replay value. It is certainly as entertaining as any number of fighting games out there. Try it out."
4,Good game,I bought this game because I remembered playing a demo version of it when I was a kid and I loved it as a kid. Now that Im older and playing it I remember liking it much more back then haha. It actually is a difficult game. You drive around trying to finish off your opponents before they finish you off.
2,Starwars Demolition,"In my professional opinion, being a master of video games, I thought the game was pretty easy and not a lot of fun. The characters had limited attacks and power meaning you could only attack so many times before you run out of power. Also I thought there weren't enough characters. Overall though it was fun being all the starwars characters and using the cheatcodes..."
1,Ghost of a Chance,The emphasis on sarcasm projected by the narrator is intolerable...she never lets up. I have never before skipped through one of my audio books but this time I did.
2,Save your ears,"I borrowed this audiobook from my library. I really love JAK. I went into this knowing it was an early book of hers, so therefor didn't have my normal expectations. However, this book, while not her best, was made that much worse by an over-enunciating narrator whose male/female voices didn't really vary. The only reason I kept listening is so I could find out what happened.The story itself wasn't that bad. If you want to read it still, my suggestion - get the hard copy."
3,a bit bland for the author,"I really expected more from this story. In a way it seemed, JAK was just pushing through it to get it finished and wasn't having any fun with the characters. It had a lot of potential and I just felt let down. Its a read for a day off from work when you can't think of anything else to do."
4,Watch the author develop,"This is a reprint of a book that was printed back in the 80's. After reading it you can really see where Krentz is going as a writer and how she's developed.I did like the book. I had wondered what was going to happen in the end because I couldn't imagine the criminals being that stupid - and they weren't. Both Julian and Anne have some baggage. ""If she hadn't fully accepted his claim, at least she wasn't going to defy him or his rule"" - what century did that come from? Actually enjoyed the 'out of shape' issue that comes up in the end - finally someone who isn't perfect."
4,"easy read, great beach book","I enjoy the easy, quick read or JAK. This book didn't disappoint me. I would suggest it to anyone who has enjoyed her books in the past."
1,Ghost of a Chance,"I couldn't get to review the others reviews of the book ""Ghost of a Chance."" I read it but, I read so many other books that I wanted to read a review on this book to see what it was about and the charaters names that were in it."
5,Time Passages,"Excellent software. Please be advised that the advertising is very misleading on this product. You can only print 5 paragraphs of your full report. You have to upgrade to standard in order to do that, and to sell the reports or print a full report you must purchase the commercial license (which is not a problem) but it is extremely costly. I spent over $300 on this software by the time I was done. Still, a commercial program can run up to $500. Everyone that has purchased or received a report has been extremely happy with it and say the reports are extremely accurate."
1,Misleading no stars,Unless you are ready to spend another $160.00 just to be able to print anything on this software DO NOT PURCHASE!! It is full of bugs and causes your comuter to lock up and shut down. So far I have paid over $200.00 on up grades and it is not working properly yet. Not user friendly and bad technical assistance. They want to sell you another $80.00 in upgrades to work out the problems. I do not recommend it.
3,"No rechargable battery, but have quite good sensitivity",It can sense sound quite good. But the battery is not rechargable.
4,Our Patience for a New G & S Production Has Been Rewarded,"Unlike previous Australian Opera adaptations of Gilbert & Sullivan operettas, this productiondoes not suffer from lyric substitution (that made obscure references even more obscure to nonAustralian audiences).The sound is very good and the quality of singing is about the best I've heard recorded on DVD (so far).Unfortunately, there is no closed captioning or sub titles, so following along, for those unfamiliar with this score, can be a challenge. But everyone, including the chorus, enunciates quite well, so there shouldn'tbe too much distress.I hope there is more coming from Sydney. It would be nice to have a complete set (as the BBC attempted about 15 years ago). (I wonder if they are forthcoming?).The quality of production was reminiscent of the D'Oyly Carte one that I caught (and carried in my memory)in the early 1960's (at the NY City Center).This is a Must Buy for a true Savoyard!"
5,"This ""Patience"" needs no patience to watch","I have to admit that I bought this DVD for two reasons: I love Gilbert & Sullivan, and I think that Anthony Warlow has one of the most remarkable voices today. I was more than pleasently surprised by the quality of both the cast and the recording of this production. The voices are all very good (yes, they are opera singers, but hey, get over it - they were in G&S's time, too) and very understandable. Lady Jane is particularly wonderful."
5,Awesome Rock & Roll!!!!!,"What can I say about Frank Marino that has not aready been said or implied. With out a doubt, he is truly one of the worlds best guitars players. For me that is saying a lot. From beginning to end Frank demenstrates how a guitar can be played. His guitar solos from ""Eye of The Storm"" and ""He's Calling,""are without a doubt as intense as a solo he performed on an earlier tune called ""Requim For a Sinner."" Anyone that Who has chance to hear this mans work will come away with but one conclusion.. ""Awesome!""How would Hendrix Have responded to this incredible performer? I don't know! But I have no doubt He would have been honuored to perform with Frank and I suspect the feelings would be mutual!Get this CD! You wont regret it!"
3,FrankMarino review 2001,"I hoped to experience to hear a kind of ""The Power of Rock & Roll"" part II with blasting heavy metal guitar playing, but overall the album is very easy (e.g. soft) listening with lots of guitar melodie, but I miss the real power of the songs. For me it has become more of a ""background"" listening record, than full intensive listening. But F.Marino certainly hasnot lost his touch of guitar playing. Hopefully next time better (= heavier)."
2,"Too much endless guitar soloing, this isn't the Allmans","When Frank Marino sticks to songs and uses guitar soloing to improve their quality, like everthing from World Anthem to Full Circle, you get Robin Trower, Rory Gallagher etc at their best.When he uses a song as an excuse for endless guitar soloing, as in much of this recording, you get redundancy. Unlike the Allman Brothers, this is not quality jamming between band members.By the way, why does Amazon include a 'NO' in 'was this review helpful to you?'. People are only human and don't like opinions that differ from themselves. With some who are less mature, this the 'NO' makes it too easy express such displeasure.Are they trying to discourage negative reviews, hence not purchase the CD. Such reviews only help a person in not being dissatisfied a product that received positive reviews"
1,The Worst Representation of Brazilian Music I have Heard,"This album is an embarassment. The producers have somehow collected the most tired hits of some pretty good bands (Banda Mel, Olodum) and packaged it into a fancy looking cd. The results are pathetic. Please, if you want to learn about Brazilian music, do not buy this cd."
5,Overfield History,"I stumbled across this book by browsing. It is wondefull! It is a great keepsake for anyone in this blood line, as I am."
3,living in a magazine is waaaaayy better,"this album isnt bad, just not as wonderful as their first album."
1,Horrible Device,"I would NOT PURCHASE this device again! In fact, I've returned the deice for a full refund! Caveat emptor!"
1,Wrong description of book,"I presumed that the book was paperback version of the hardcover book of Upholstery Fundamentals, but instead it was a 12-page copy of the Answer Key to Upholstery Fundamentals. Therefore, I do believe that the description of the book is wrong. You are not the only company with this difficulty; I ordered the same paperback book from Alibris and got the answer key as well."
5,"Hilarious, extremely entertaining.","Mary Balogh's Regency romances may resemble others in the series from the outside, but the unusual combination of intelligent plotting, moving and credible characters and funny dialogue put them among my favourite reading.This particular book is one of her most light-hearted and enjoyable"
3,under-rated,"Mary Balogh is one of my fav's but this one fell short of my "" I love Mary"" books. The one thing I love about Mary is her ability to include the reader in a sympathetic and 'realistic' tale about the heroines story. I felt in this book that the male character wasn't passionate enough about his heroine; however funny. The characters in the book make you laugh, but you do sense the lack of passion and intimacy between them, which leaves you wondering whether (long after the story finishes)the hero and heroine find true happiness."
3,Too silly,"Both the story line and the heroine are just too silly for words. The ""I thought he was gay because he wears bright colors"" plot device is completely anachronistic. 1) Men did wear bright colors during this period, and 2) the attitude towards gay people was not this tolerant."
4,Good but not Balogh's best.,"I love Mary Balogh's books and I have got nearly all of them. However, this is not my favorite. I suppose it is a matter of taste. I do not like the hero and heroine here as much as the ones in other stories like ' A Counterfeit Betrothal', ""Courting Julia', 'The Incurable Matchmaker','A Christmas Bride' ...etc. because I think the characters are rather shallow.Nevertheless, this book is quite enjoyable.The others are excellent."
1,Poor product,This slide set is a poor product. I purchased it based on the picture and description to install a drawer in a cabinet I am building. It is worthless and will not work. The workmanship is also poor. The cost is not worth trying to return it so it will probably just be trashed.Charles
3,Aerobics for Beginners,"I bought this DVD after watching Gilad on TV. My physical fitness level is not all that great and I found I could keep up with some of his workouts. I only gave this three stars because I don't want people to think that this DVD means instant weight loss. We all know that weight loss involves more than purchasing a DVD. The set and the music is similar to Gilad's TV show... on the beach with some sort of so-so background music. The routine is a good start for beginners and fairly easy to follow. There are a couple of places that I can't follow the exact footwork so I just alter the routine. I love the warm up and the cool down and I can deal with the aerobics but during the abdominal toning I tend to curse at the TV. This isn't a video for the ""fitness guru"" but if you are a beginner this DVD is pretty darn good."
2,Exact same as New Best of Bodies in Motion,"I'm a fan of Gilad's workouts. Updating my collection, I purchased Beginners Weight Loss & Toning Program and The New Best of Bodies in Motion. Sad to say, they are exactly the same. Different label between the two, but if you buy one you do not need the other."
3,Beginner's my Butt!,Gilad was in great shape when he recorded this video. I don't feel like this workout is great for beginners. Walking and very light weight training is good for beginners. I've been weight training for about a year and I have a moderate to difficult time doing this workout. My sister who was a beginner gave up on the workout. I do like the workout and it is fun; it's just hard when everyone looks so fit and the beginner is trying to keep up.
5,Awesome dvd,This workout was great not only for a beginner but for someone like myself who has not worked out in a long time.It is direct and keeps you motivated to want to push yourself to the endVery happy with the purchase and highly reccomend this dvd
3,Not the greatest LeapPad book,"We were a bit disappointed in this book. The tunes and tempo of several of the rhymes is different than the ""usual"" versions that my kids are familiar with. The pages could really use to be more durable, the cord from the pen has caused several small tears and the pages rip from the spiral binding much too easily. For the price, I would suggest getting a different book...Thomas the Tank Engine & Bob the Builder were both very popular with my 4 yr old son."
2,great expectations,"After being thoroughly impressed with the original LeapPad material, I was just as underwhelmed by this offering. The best song was Twinkle Twinkle Little Star. My wife was annoyed with one particular woman's singing. My wife knows good singing having been in a choir that toured world-wide.I was looking forward to having my kid know the words to Old McDonald had a Farm and other classic melodies that they've heard from other toys but without lyrics.The book is relatively thin. It also seemed to lose track of where it was more than I ever noticed before (required clicking on the Green GO button more). Etc."
3,It's Okay - Certainly 30 Gold Nuggets out of 91,"You can read this book in an afternoon, and if you are looking for ways to boost your business, I'd definitely recommend you check this out from the library rather than buying it. 70 - 80% of the recommendations here are focused on the career side of improvement.Much of the recommendations are, as one reviewer posted, common sense, and certainly these have nearly all been covered by other books. There are a few that are well-done and that I've certainly not seen before:* Not every budget deserves your respect* Shrink your world into a small town* A ""heads-up"" has consequences too* Your job is just another projectAnd a handful of others. I'm not convinced the book is worth the money at an individual level; check it out from your local library first. If you find yourself taking 2+ pages of notes and you're only one-third of the way through the book, then go and buy it yourself.J. Avellanet, Co-Founder of Cerulean Associates LLC"
4,Marriage Enrichment,We have in the past conducted several Marriage Enrichment Classes using first their VHS video and more recently their DVD version. While the classes were a success we thought it would be even better to know what was contained in the workbooks by Drs. Carl Brecheen and Paul Faulkner and maybe for future classes incorporate some of their ideas and points from the workbook. The workbook has given us an insight to their way of thinking and will be incorporated in our next class on Marriage Enrichment. We are looking forward to our future classes!
2,A disappointment...,"Hoped to dust off the college French with this audio set, but it's not very good. Exercises are brief and very fast-paced not to mention extremely boring. The audio quality is not so great either. The exercise booklet that accompanies the CD set is small and flimsy - it resembles a users guide for a low-end appliance! Stick with the book only version for grammar exercises and look elsewhere for audio review and practice."
3,Good practice hampered by audio quality issues,"The books in this series are quite excellent, but I was very disappointed in this audio CD. The exercises are fine (albeit too fast-paced for anyone but a real expert), and do indeed poke into some excellent grammar points that are not typically covered even in a fourth-semester college French class.My issue is with the audio quality. It's clear that the producers of this CD merely took a VERY BAD cassette version of this course and made a CD from it without doing any processing at all. The tape hiss dominates the tracks, and as a result it is often quite difficult to hear what the people are saying during the exercises. When you're dealing with a second language, it's imperative that you are able to distinguish between the words, and in many cases that's simply impossible here.I'd give this 4+ stars for content, but 2 or less for the audio issues."
1,Don't buy this game,This doesn't deserve a star at all. My kids got this game for Christmas. This game isn't worth buying. The game was boring to my kids and my husband and I. We didn't see the reason of the whole game. I would save your money for a better game.
1,don't bother,"I only gave this game one star because zero stars wasn't an option.This is the dumbest game my family has ever played. The whole family thought it was boring. One problem is the game board and die. The game only has three colors on which to move, you have to state before rolling the die which space/color you'll move to if you roll the right color, but if you roll the wrong color, you stay put. I stayed in the same spot for 4 turns before finally using a token to move. When the game was finally over, my 6 year old asked if we could take it to the thrift store, and he was the one who got it as a gift!"
2,Aerobic part is too short,"The actual aerobics part of the 60-minute workout is only 22 minutes! The rest was warmup and abs, etc.It's a fine tape. Typical for the genre, and the exercises are fine. I just think people should know what they are buying."
3,Very 80's workout,"This is an ok workout and if you can get past the 80's ambiance and the less fluid moves from that time period, you will like it. I prefer Gilad's newer workout dvds, i.e. the Cuts and Curves is excellent."
5,I can still move the next day!,Easy to follow with 2 workouts in one CD! Start with low impact 30 min for a couple weeks then when YOU are ready do the 60 min. You can't go wrong with Gilad
3,Pretty decent work out,"I bought this DVD since I like Gilads 45/45 workout DVD so much. The 60 minute workout is pretty good and low impact though not as challenging as the cardio portion of the 45/45 DVD, which does include a fair amount of high impact moves. I do the 60 minute session from time to time on a weekend when I am looking for a moderate workout, don't feel like using weights and my knees are looking for a break. I did the 30 minute session once and didn't find it to be much of a workout so don't think I'll be doing that one too often. I thought it was interesting that Gilad's mother was one of those doing the 30 minute exercises. I must commend her for being in great shape!"
3,gilad 30 and 60 min. low impact workout,"its ok a little old school,,but for a quick early am workout it warms up the muscles and stretches you out."
2,Not good for me,"I always liked Gilad because he stays in a defined area and doesn't rush around the room. I don't have a living room the size of a theater. But now that I'm older and have been sedintary for quite a while I needed something to start exercising again.I find him just too fast for me, by the time I get the movements down he's on to the next thing. I'm glad these people are in really good shape, I'm not, for me it's not a competition. I don't know if I will buy his stuff again I'm just not in my 20's anymore and I need something to help ME. Sorry Gilad."
4,Classic Gilad,"This DVD is classic Gilad workouts. It is low impact and Gilad is a great motivator, making exercise a pleasant experience. We purchased this DVD to add variety to our collection of fitness DVDs, but we seem to prefer the newer and fresher Gilad Body Sculpt series."
1,"NOT romantic, NOT a comedy","This film is not what I was expecting. The review on the back of the box describes the film as ""Warm and Witty"" but I found it to be dark and depressing.Everyone loves a romantic wedding, but those who are looking for something that is lighthearted and funny would find ""Father of the Bride"" (I recommend the 1950 version starring Spencer Tracy), ""The Wedding Banquet"" or ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" to be more enjoyable."
1,What Keystone Kops?,"It would be nice if a product which advertised Keystone Kops had Keystone Kops on the films. In fact this is Keystone Comedy films, but mostly without the Kops. Out of four Keystone Comedy films only one has a brief sequence with the Keystone Kops. If you're looking for Keystone Kops, this isn't it. The cover art is about all you'll get."
3,O.K call,This call works but I cant say that it is great. have used it for about a mounth and It is starting to make a noise like a feed back on a p.a. system not going to fool a dog with that.
5,One of the best full-length Romeo and Juliet's,"Definitely one of the best full-length recordings of Prokofiev's beloved masterpiece around. Lorin Maazel and the Cleveland Orchestra ideally combine playing of raw intensity and soaring lyricism. Maazel's generally fast tempi, hard-driven rhythms and conducting full of punch give plenty of excitement in the dramatic pages of the score, while the poignant love-music has a sense of inevitability and lurking doom. The Decca recording, although dating from the pre-digital age (1973), is stunning and can compete with the very best modern discs by its dynamic range and the details in the sound picture. At this price this ""Romeo and Juliet"" is a bargain. Highly recommended."
1,It's not easy being a Jedi,Ouch. This game is just...ouch. Maybe the developers behind this didn't test the game. At all. That might explain the atrocious gameplay we see here today. The music is the only plus (and that's only because George Williams composed it). Yoda must be rolling in his grave.
3,"I like the new graphics, but its too hard to become the jedi",The graphics are so sweet. i love them so much. But the game just is too challanging. Darth Maul is almost Mission Impossible. Hes unstoppable. I only reccomend this game for people who like challanges.
3,It was good,"I thought the video was decent, she showed some decent techniques. Nothing TOO spectacular, I would say buy only if you think you want to learn how to do a bald weave,or how to use the razor/ scissors differnt ways. I will say it was a good video, for myself alot of it was self explanatory."
2,Dreadful Video Recording,"I love the Kirov. And I love Sleeping Beauty. But as I believe at least one reviewer pointed out, you need night vision goggles to view this dvd up until the final act. What was the lighting designer thinking? It's impossible to judge the performance on its merits because of this issue."
3,A mutilated masterpiece,"The lightning is so bad that apart from the act II scenes in the forest you can't see much of the scenery and sometimes only the front dancers with the corps of ballet sunk into darkness.What can be seen is delightful, though."
5,A beautiful Sleeping Beauty Production,I have 2 versions of Sleeping Beauty with me; 1 is this DVD and the other copy is the Bolshoi Ballet's Sleeping Beauty which they performed for their Japan tour in the 1980s.I personally prefer this version because of:1. Excellent choreography particularly in Act 1 with the entrance of the Corps de Ballet and the various fairies2. Nice acting towards Act 1 and Act 2 where the evil fairy forcibly removes the hair of the King's servant in her anger3. An excellent demonstration of the Kirov style5 stars from me
2,Lighting....,The lighting in this DVD was terrible and you could hardly see what was going on on the stage because the camera was either too far away or too close. Also the dancers were rarely together perfectly as ballerinas should be.
3,A classic with wonderful performers and really bad lighting,"This should have been a wonderful performance. Great dancing by Asylmuratova and Zaklinsky and several others who annoyingly are nowhere identified! No cast list on the video or the liner notes. Unfortunately, in many scenes, strangely in the Prologue and also in the Awakening Scene (Act 2), the lighting is so dim you can hardly see the dancers or the beautiful sets and costumes. The scale of this ballet is one of the things that makes it so enjoyable. In this filming, it is often lost. If you are a fan of Asylmuratova (as I am - saw her dance this role exquisitely with the Kirov in NYC in June 1999) this tape is worth having for your collection. She's a delight as Aurora and at least has a spotlight on her most of the time. Otherwise, chose one of several other Sleeping Beauty's available."
3,mixed feelings,"this record kinda drags. it would have been better as an shorter album, cause it just runs out of power. besides that, the first two songs are great and definately worth listening to. ""An Afterlife of Death"" is one of the best songs in this style of music."
5,A tremendous first novel! Bravo!,What a fabulous piece of literature from this first time novelist! I found Continental Divide a thoroughly enjoyable page turner! One can only hope that this not the last work from the gifted Naveed Burney.
4,"definitely different from typical SP, still worth a listen","I had the opportunity to see the video of the song at one of those music video websites. Even though this isn't your typical Scritti Politti fare, the whole song is infectious to listen to. For some reason or another, Mos Def's rapping blends in well with the music and Green's background vocals. Because of ""Tinseltown To The Boogiedown"", I am definitely getting ""Anomie & Bonhomie""!"
1,waste of talent,"Green was once a great singer and songwriter. I imagine he still is. But what was this? I'm sorry but Puff Politti was a terrible mistake. Following in Art of Noise's footsteps, Green has delved into rap. The only problem is he didn't just delve---he dove in head first! The only likeable portions of this song were when there wasn't any rap and Green was the one singing. I hate to say it but please, Green, go back to the drawing board, try again, and remember who your fans are...or were."
3,Could be a lot better with heavy rubber bands.,"I've owned two of these and neither one lasted very long. When they first came out they were very well made of aluminum, a real quality product. When the tension wire broke I called the factory and they said no problem send it in to get it fixed. They sent back one made of plastic which lost all weight tension within weeks, its worthless. The problem with this product is that it starts losing tension immediatlely, the spring gets weakened with use. A better product would be with heavy duty rubber bands that you could replace or add to for more resistance. Put the rubber on and I'll buy it again but will do wrist curls with weights until then. They only people who buy this is weight trainers or the injured and they don't care about how it looks just if it works."
1,Not enough tension..,"The first time I used this piece of equipment, I had to screw the tension mechanism all the way out. Twenty-five reps was nothing. It would be a good piece of equipment if it had more tension. Get a barbell, add some weight - whatever works for you - rest your forearms on the thighs and let the bar roll all of the way down to your fingertips and then curl it back up toward your biceps - squeeze![[ASIN:B00076SPZY Marcy Wedge For Forearm and Wrist."
2,acceptable but not worth the price,the resistance isn't enough for a really strong person or someone who has been working out for a couple of years. it is ok for a beginner or a recreational athlete. and it is definitely overprices. you can make your own forearm exerciser in the house with a bath towel and some paperweights.
2,armwedge,"I had the original, which was made from cast metal and was great, this one lacks quality and is a piece of plastic junk!"
3,For beginers,Nice idea and not bad quality but resistance on maximum level (level 5) is still too easy if you are person that at least visit Gym from time to time. So it can be useful only to un-experienced amateurs.
4,I will always have one of these,"For anyone who wants good grip strength or is even recovering from carpal tunnel or broken wrist, these things are AWESOME. There is nothing like it anywhere.Its true the older one seemed more substantial but it also was clunky. It lasted for years and when it broke, I replaced it with the new plastic one. It works fine, just a little different. Try and exercise your wrists back and forth between arms for awhile curling your wrist and reversing it also. See how long you can take the burn. These work just fine !"
3,Not enough resistance,I previously owned a Gold's Gym wrist exerciser but it broke (when I ran over it in the garage). I bought the Marcy thinking it was a similar replacement. Not so. Not as comfortable on the wrist and the resistance is too week.
4,Not too bad.,"This is the first product I've ever bought to work out my forearm, so I can't compare it to anything else...but I will say it does work. I've noticed a strength increase in my forearm in just a month of using it. It's comfortable and easy to use. I would like the highest resistance to be a little harder, though."
2,Mediocre,"Add me to the chorus of naysayers. There are a few good concepts in here, buried in repetitive, obtuse writing and confusing (!) layout.Some, even many, of the examples are good, but the book is too small in format to do them proper justice. I wouldn't be surprised if White designed the book for a larger size, but it got reduced to cut costs.I'm a dabbler/hobbyist with a limited design bookshelf, but for what it's worth, I would suggest instead:The Non-Designer's Design Book-- for a much clearer and more compelling introduction to graphic design basics for novices. Simple and informal, but way more memorable.Logo Font & Lettering Bible: A Comprehensive Guide to the Design, Construction and Usage of Alphabets and Symbols-- colorful, packed with visual ideas, pure fun.Thinking with Type: A Critical Guide for Designers, Writers, Editors, & Students (Design Briefs)-- much better written, more comprehensive, and better looking ""serious"" coverage of similar material."
2,"Space, Unity, Page Architecture, And Type?????????","Not sure where the author came up with book title but it is not accurate at all! Space, unity, page architecture, and type are NOT the elements of graphic design. Anyone who has studied graphic design in college knows this. First off, there are actually 5 elements to graphic design, not 4. The elements of graphic design are: line, shape, texture, color and space. As there are the elements of graphic design, there are also the principles of graphic design. The principles of graphic design are: balance, proximity, hierarchy, alignment, repetition, contrast, and dominance.I did buy this book however. Despite the fact that the author is not aware of the elements of graphic design (ouch!), the book does have its moments."
2,"Visually confusing, the layout makes the content questionable.","The layout of this book is confusing and really, really bad. The content is repetitive and dull, and is very basic. I hope nobody learns to design like the author, his book is a trainwreck.I like The Non Designer's Design Book for really basic stuff, and I am a huge fan of Designing With Type for typography.Don't buy this book, it is dissapointing"
1,Unorganized and highly subjective.,"I know that design could be construed as using beautifully flowered language, but usually there's authors will combine that language with one main idea per paragraph which is (at least usually) part of a section or chapter. Alex passes up this convention in favor of metaphors and analogies which seemed more or less randomly selected. Unfortunately I wasn't able to get almost anything out of the first 30 pages of this book.Severely disappointed."
1,DONT GET FOOLED WITH THIS ONE!,"This book is problematic on all levels. The first of which is the cover....look how eratic the image(s) are on the cover. Observe how the books titles, and authors name actually start on the back cover and work their way around the spine and to the front. This is exceptionally bad design. Today, I returned my copy of the book. Also note that the author fails to detail which (if any) companies he has worked for....saying only that he has ""worked in the America's""....what the hell does that mean? If you buy this book wou will be returning it sooner orlater! Youv'e been warned!"
5,Reasonably comprehensive explanation of basic principles.,"An in depth view that stops short of being a hardcore text book though I would not hesitate to use it as an introductory text for a college class. This makes it an enjoyable, non-threatening, yet extensive, read that lists many design principles for mainly print type publications. The design principles are taught such that they can be more broadly applied to other disciplines by a creative thinker. Contents include the concepts of: Space, Unity, Page Architecture, and Type. A good first read on the subject and gives much more useful information and advice than many of the self glorifying self indulgent publications that other designers put out. The book does not list many specifics for different types of publications, it does give an in depth description of the guiding theories of design for print. the chapters on the use of space are more complete than others I've read. Highly recommended"
5,"A mini book, sort of -- great gifts!","We love this series -- a perfect gift for friends, family and co-workers. The cards look like a deck of playing cards, with bright illustrations. Each card offers useful information.We especially like this one, since it is about Simple Living, a favorite topic of ours. We're buying a bunch, so if you're on our Christmas list, act surprised!Extraordinary stocking stuffer with real ideas!"
5,Excellent service,Thank you so much for sending me the 52 cards in such an expedited manner. I really do appreciate the fast service. Thank you so much!
1,Doesn't work,I bought one for my PDA. It did not charge it up with the PDA running and with the PDA not running. It would not even keep the PDA from running down it's own battery.
3,Great Performance ruined by bad recording,"I can't stand it when recording engineers go out of their way to ruin recordings. For some reason, the engineer for this recording chose to place some microphones very close to the piano, and some far. The result is very unnatural sound. I wish I could find a good recording of the Musical Moments, but have struck out twice. (My other recording is with Lupu, which is also a superb performance but a lousy recording - early digital). I wonder if Schiff is aware of the sabotage done to his art by over zealous recording engineers. As far as the music goes, I find Schiff to be one of the best Schubert interpreters, which is why I bought this CD. Schiff plays this music superbly as expected."
1,Storage case ruined the roller,We bought at a local home show and tried it when we got home. It does pick up pet hair but has to be rinsed repeatedly. It took about twenty rinses to pick the hair off one medium sized chair. My wife stored in in it's case and it stuck to the case and riped the sticky material off the roler. Now it is useless. I would not buy again.
1,Sticky roller.,"It would not pick anything up when first used. After washing the surface, it got a bit sticky. It does not do a very good job of picking up cat hair or lint. I would not buy this again."
2,Don't waste your money on this -,"This is barely sticky not enough to remove these while dust spots on a wool/cashmere jacket, it just grab extra fine particules so you need to clean it after each roll basically so wetting your garment in the process, and very inconvenient to have to rinse all the time to not see the obvious heavier bigger particles, this IS NOT sticky enough, 20 years ago in France we had a company making this but really sticky and it did work so the technology is here but not from that brand unfortunately !!!"
1,DO NOT BUY! EXTREMELY INEFFECTIVE!,"I purchased this product a few months ago thinking I would never have to buy another lint roller again, I was completely wrong. The roller itself is not very sticky and does not pick up everything from clothes. Also, you can only use it on a very small area without having to rinse it off, wait for it to dry, and then use it again. It is just not practical. I highly recommend buying the normal sticky tape style lint rollers."
1,JUNK - DO NOT BUY,Product is junk! Does not work as advertised. Used it once then ran roller under warm water to clean it and let it dry. When dry it was no longer sticky.
1,Would not recommend,It just didn't perform as presented and is very hard to rinse. Uses so much water trying to rinse it that it's wasteful. Sorry. I had high hopes!
2,will not last that long,"I had something like this, may not have been the same brand, it worked fantastically well for a few weeks. Eventually, after being rinsed many times, it was useless because all the ""sticky"" wore off. I know nothing lasts forever but I was very disappointed that it didn't last longer than it did. Just FYI, you'll have to replace it eventually."
1,JUNK!,"This is a knock off of the ""as seen on tv"" sticky items. Ordered this item because it seemed the be the only of its kind offered by Amazon prime. What junk. This doesn't work worth a darn. Picks up about 1/8th of the hair vs a tape roller. Then you have to rinse it after each swipe. I read reviews about the ""as seen on tv"" about how hard they were to wash clean well thats about the only thing this has going for it. You stick it under running water and its clean again, I guess thats what happens though when the product was never sticky to begin with. Save your money. Its just 1 more piece of junk for the landfill."
3,sticky tape roller,"Works on minor lint, dog hair issues, but no replacement for the ""tape"". Does clean easily, tho'. would not buy again or recommend"
2,Not so great,"It removes lint until it fills up, then you have to rinse it off. I have to rinse it about 5 times to get lint off my black scrub top. Very time consuming. Not handy at all"
3,works okay good buy for the money,bought this a while ago because it was substantially cheaper than the real version however it just doesn't work as well doesn't pick up as much dirt and lint and has to be cleaned more often.
4,good old school,i enjoyed the show of the number 1 hype man flavor flav and the #1 teacher in hip hop chuck d. go get it!!!
5,Strong&Powerful,Performance from Public Enemy.it's really sad that they no longer get half the attention as many of these Bums out now that are making a Mockery of Rap as we know it.with PE School is always in Session.this is a solid Performance&Great Insight to PE.
3,not quite hot tracks,"this is a very predictable teeny-bopper album, the one song that saves it is surprisingly Jordan Knight track. who would have thought that this ex new kid really does have talent."
3,GREAT TEEN CD,I LISTENED TO ALL THESE SONGS AS A TEENAGER. I STILL LOVE THEM. GREAT GIFT FOR 12-15 YEAR OLDS.
1,Kwik Tek Big Slice,We had a major issue with this tube and had to return it. It submarined very quickly and was unusable.
2,Airhead slice tube,"My kids do not like this tube. The connection to the tube is too low on the tube, causing it to drag in the water and constantly splash water in their faces."
5,What a RIDE!!!,"The Airhead Slice is a BLAST on the water!!! I'm a 46 yr. old woman that doesn't enjoy boating, but to solve the issue of teenagers fighting over who goes first, on the new tube, I got suckered into jumping in the water and going for a ride. It was great!!! Of course, once I finished my ride, the kids never let me back on the tube. LOL It's great for one or two people...you can lay on it, or sit up. Excellent choice for on the water fun!"
2,experienced tube owner,"Purchased this tube after our ninja blaster finally quit on us after 3 seasons. The hookup for the tube is on the bottom of the tube so the kids were continually getting pulled under water until the boat and tube plained out. This is a fairly dangerous situation especailly for new tubers that didn't let go and got dragged for several yards under water before they came up for air???. The new tube also created lots of spray which we never had before, the kids asked for goggles so they could see. Yes once we were up and running it provided a great and bouncy ride but these are definitely issues."
2,I got one good run.,"Took this out on the river and the kids had a blast! It was one of the smoothest small tubes I had ridden on, and the kids were able to stay on. We tubed for about 3 hours and on the way into the boat-ramp there was a huge pop. The inner bladder had popped and it was just sitting on the deck of the pontoon boat. I now have a ball instead of a tube."
1,Sanjuro,This BlueRay should be region free and it is not - so I cannot watch it; please advise if a BlueRay product is not region free
3,Dealing in the former,"3 1/2Catchy and sensitive indie pop folk debut seems a little more charming than subsequently refined output, although Watson's tone and delivery has matured even if the music hardly came along."
1,unremarkable,"After hearing a few rilo kiley songs i liked here and there, i asked a friend which album he'd recommend. he preferred their ""older stuff."" this was the oldest album i could find on amazon and i have to say, it's completely unremarkable. the songs are so bland they aren't even catchy. you might find one or two songs on here that are worth listening to more than once, but unless you are a die-hard fan who needs to complete a collection, i'd get one of their newer albums."
4,Beats the live show. . .,"I saw Rilo Kiley live, playing with the beautiful Ozma. I wasn't particularly enthusiastic about their show, but I liked a few of the songs I heard, so I bought the CD. From the merch table, because I like indie bands and merch is a happy thing. Bored, waiting for a ride home, I opened the CD up and was amazed by how adorable the art was, and how much of a concept album it seemed to be. SEEMED being the key word, because although the whole thing is built around an airplane, most of the songs are love songs, as it should be.It's a beautiful album, wonderful to sleep to. Whether you're in love, as I am, or have just broken up with someone, it will soothe you. Which is rare for a bunch of love songs."
5,yes!,"Product came in a timely manner and it the condition that was statedAll in all, im happy user. ; )"
4,Great Lyrics!,"Jimmy Buffett's Hot Water shows his fans how diverse he is. This album contains up-beat songs like ""Homemade Music,"" a multi-lingual song: ""L'air de La Louisianne,"" ""Smart Woman"" has great harmonies, and ""Thats what Living is to Me"" is one of my favorites. I highly recomend this album, however, I believe that you must listen to it a number of times to fully appreciate the lyrics."
5,Sizzling With Style,"Its a shame that all the people who put down this recording offer very little in substance as to why they do not like this CD. Personally the lyrics are extremely touching and the styles varying greatly. Each of the rock n roll numbers stand out because of differing inflections in tone. L'Affaire D'Louisiana(excuse me if I misspelled) is a romantic ballad which offers some delicate guitar and accordion sounds. Great Heart, King Of Somewhere Hot, and Smart Woman have some heavy tropical influences due to some pleasant steel drum sounds. Thats What Living Means To Me is a well written song that would fit in well in any coffee house setting. Overall, this is one of Jimmy's most overlooked recordings."
2,Not The Best Buffett,"If you're a Buffett fan, it's worth buying the album for the last three songs. Unfortunately, the rest of the album is extremely flat. It's almost as if Buffett were being pushed to put out an album, but his heart wasn't in it. I'm not certain, but I think the album might have been put together while he and his wife were separated. Not only is there no ""spring in his step"" from a vocal perspective, but he even seems to get down on himself somewhat."
3,Treading Water,"Hot Water is an up and down affair from Jimmy Buffett. The ups on the album are quite high. ""Homemade Music"" is a truly inspired and great song, ""Pre-You"" is a simple and sweet ballad and ""King Of Somewhere Hot"" is a salsafied burner. After hitting rock bottom with Floridays, Hot Water is a nice rebound."
4,worthwhile,"Even though this disc does not stand up to many of Buffett's classic albums, there are still some great tracks here and much range. ""Pre-You"" is very romantic. ""Smart Woman"" and ""Great Heart"" are solid uptempo tunes. I still can't get ""King of Somewhere Hot"" out of my head. You can't go wrong here! It's Buffett!"
5,Distilled DeMello,"Shining through this little book is Anthony DeMello's distinctive clarity in seeing 'around' the conventions and conditioning we all carry, unknowingly, within us. It's all done in a light, anecdotal way with a characteristic dose of good humor at every step. If you enjoy Anthony DeMello - or haven't met him yet, this book is a breezy but thought-provoking taste of his approach and his style to spiritual teaching."
5,A golden oldie,"The performance of the Dvorak is almost 50 years old by now. When it first appeared it was highly regarded and considered a serious rival to Toscanini's. In its new cd format it is still a staggering experience. The slow movement is deeply considered, heartfelt but devoid of cheap sentimentalism. Some may find the Janacek Sinfonietta too slow, and several new versions are certainly better played. No matter: the Dvorak makes this cd indispensable."
4,A Thorough Explanation of John's Gospel,I read this book in connection with the class I took on the Gospel of John. Bryant & Krause did a terrific job explaining the meaning of the text in a clear and understandable way. I would recommend this book for anyone preparing to study John's gospel for the first time. A great reference tool!
3,Bratz Forever Diamondz-RC Cruiser Car White 49 MHz,"Somewhat disappointed with the price of the car given the hype it was given. It is much smaller in person than it appeared online. Batteries run down quickly, despite the fact the car doesn't move that quickly. I think my daughter may have been too old for this item although she was asking for it. That said, it is a beautiful car. Appears to be well constructed. It has a working radio and enough room for 4 Bratz dolls. I think it is a nice item, just not for our family."
3,Bobby Brown,"It took way too long to get it; I really do not have anything good to say the CD is Ok, but I waited too long for it. I order one off ebay and it was here in three days this one took four weeks."
4,Bobby B-Don't Be Cruel,"Classic artist, great music. Most songs are number ones or things remembered from then. It still sounds good and is refreshing to hear."
5,Classic Bobby stuff,"After the teen-carrier with New Edition, before the New Jack Swing-classic Bobby album and a terrible marriage with Whitney... this stuff will make it last forever. I'm reading the title of the tracks, and every song is classic: the great up-tempo hits ""Don't Be Cruel"", ""Every Little Step"" and ""My Prerogative"" (greater than Britney's), and slow & sexy songs ""Roni"" and ""Rock Wit'cha"". The sounds of the 80's were mixed with the flavour of the 90's. I remember that time rhythm was rhythm, RnB was a music style, not the crashes of hammer, and mellow was real mellow. If we look at the list of the collaborators, we see the name of LA & Face, Teddy & Aaron, the beautiful Karyn White. So never forget where the style came from..."
5,One of the best of the 80's,"This was a pretty good album when it first came out. Even today some of those songs are still hot, like My peragative, Every little step, and Dont be cruel. But can he still sound like this?"
1,But it is cruel. Oh so cruel,"This is one of those albums that you wish never existed. Much like the Black Plague it's legendary evil is notorious. Whether it was the videos, the dancing, or that ridiculous haircut, everything Bobby does is cruel.Mass hysteria broke out over this album as boys and girls couldn't get enough of it. I smelled a conspircacy. I bought the album and studied it's various parts and searched for hidden clues. What I found frightened me.In 'My Perogative' turn the bass way up. The drums are actually beating out a Morse Code! The message is........'I'm gonna be a crackhead and so are you. I'll sell you crack and smoke it with you.'Scary stuff."
4,"Like him or not, there's no bringing down this album","When Bobby Brown gets talked about these days, it's mostly about the trouble that he's constantly in. However, this is a great album that will make you want to forget about all of that and just party like it's 1988. It's not absoulutely perfect; some of the non-hits can feel like filler for people who haven't heard them a lot, but songs like ""Don't Be Cruel"", ""Roni"", ""Rock Wit'cha"", and ""Every Little Step"" are some of the best New-Jack Swing ever."
5,I Really Love You Bobby,The best Bobby Album. Bobby Brown use to be the thang. I love me some Don't Be Cruel that was my Jam. The whole album is consistant with hits after hits especially the biginning. Roni & Rock Wit'cha are some the hottest SLOW Jamz. I wish On Our Own was on here. I liked that song.
5,Love it,So hard to find the Deodorant daily liners. Great job Amazon. The price is about the same as in the store but this comes right at your door without having to leave the house so great deal.
3,"Nice ""toy.""","It is a nice ""toy,"" but I was looking for an ADULT style toy. These are made of foam and I was really looking for something made of harder material for an adult fun night. This is more for kids under 12."
2,I do not recomend!,To me this is one of the worst monitors there is! It for apparently no reason will loose conection with the base in the babies room so all of a sudden you hear a constant beep and nothing you do will fix it and then poof just like that it stops and it is working again another problem is the plug in for the charger unplugs from the charger... Why? The charger doesn't work if it's not plugged in..That made no sense to me. PLus range wise we can barrely take the thing out the front door yes we have a 2 story house but it isn't that big of a house! I have 3 children so in the past I have had other baby monitors and I wish I still had them!
3,Worthless battery,"When fully charged, the battery in the parent unit only lasts 15 minutes. Unfortunately, I have to move the base around for the parent unit in order to use it. It would be better if the parent unit took AA batteries, then at least I could replace them!"
2,not reliable,"We bought this monitor for our 3rd baby. It is probably our 4th monitor and has been the worst one to date. It went out of range often, drained batteries fast, and then just cut out and missed the baby crying several times. I found myself still checking on our baby because I couldn't trust the monitor to function properly, so I finally bought a new one."
2,Not worth it,"This monitor is a great idea. It's really nice to be able to take it anywhere without having to plug it in. There are, however, a few problems which make this monitor a real pain. For one, once the monitor goes out of range (which happens at about 75 feet) it doesn't just come in fuzzy, it doesn't come in at all. It beeps until you get it back in range, which defeats the whole purpose of being able to take it with you into the yard etc...The second problem is that we have had our monitor for 1 year and the battery is already pretty much worthless. No matter how long it has charged on its base, it loses a charge after about an hour. I guess we would need to invest in a new battery, but we'll probably just get a different monitor. I would hope they come out with an enhanced version of this monitor, but for now...not worth the price."
1,"Ugh, Very Disappointing!!!!",This monitor is a PAIN to say the least. This is our 2nd time buying Baby Monitors. We chose this one based on the great Consumer Product Reviews it recived. The testing facilities must not be very unrealistic because this monitor works terribly!!! It's digital which we thought would be clearer and have longer range than our older analog model. Boy were we ever wrong!!! This thing beeps ALL THE TIME!!! The signal just goes out for no apparent reason. Don't get me wrong when it works it is very clear but the problem is getting to maintain a good digital signal. We have tried EVERYTHING and nothing stops this thing from beeping. We don't have a ton of electronics and wiring in our home. It's very frustrating to hear it at all hours of the night.My advice it to go with ANALOG and leave the digital behind. I am doing it as we speak.
1,Not worth the money,"I bought this monitor hoping to avoid interference as I have 2 small kids and require 2 separate monitors. I have a Sony analog monitor that works great except for the pops and clicks which drive me crazy. This monitor doesn't pop or click at all for the 30 minutes it works. The battery life is terrible, the only way I can use it is to carry around the cord and keep it plugged in, which is extremely inconveinant. I also found that the base does not hold the monitor well so I have to plug the cord directly into the side of the monitor."
2,Probably a lemon,"The sound quality is good on these units, though a little more volume would be nice. Unfortunately, the Parent Unit won't hold a charge and needs to be in the charger at all times to work. So we had to send it back. Without this problem, I would have rated it a 4."
3,Disappointed,"I had another Graco monitor which I loved, so I got this one. I really liked it for the most part; for me, it wasn't quite loud enough but I like being able to hear every move my baby makes. We co-sleep and I want to make sure she stays in the bed, since she is not in a crib. Anyways, the beeping is annoying as another reviewer mentioned, and the battery doesn't last that long, but the MOST annoying thing is that mine broke after only two months of use! Ridiculous! I don't know what happened. I put it on the charger and went to bed, and in the morning I just had a red light and it wouldn't pick up any sounds at all. Very disappointed."
1,Worst monitor i have ever used,This monitor shuts off in the middle of the night. The battery life is terrible. The company sent me a new unit in the mail and it did the very same thing. I would not recommend.
5,Awsome Product,This product is better then what i expected. it has good range and battery life is the best. you will be able to hear every little noise coming from your baby or even the room.
4,Good Monitor,Good baby monitor overall. Sound quality is good except we are getting an occasional clicking sound and I can't find where the interference is coming from.
5,excellent range monitor,"this monitor has excellent range, and picks up even the slightest sound. it clips onto my pants and has long battery life (as long as i recharge it overnight). highly recommended for range and clarity."
1,Garbage,"This monitor is a piece of garbage. It barely works when I am one floor down from the baby's room. Going to our finished basement is out of the question!!! I supposedly upgraded by buying this monitor, but wished I had my older, much cheaper, nondigital monitor from my first child.Don't buy this!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,purchase witth caution...,"I will state that this monitor is very clear and has no interference BUT ours died after five months of just nighttime use and neither charger works...we tried plugging the monitors directly into the wall, charging for days at a time, and even searched endlessly for replacement batteries with no luck. I had ignored a review I read similar to the one I'm writing just before I purchased this imonitor, I learned my lesson! Purchase with caution."
2,Constantly loses signal,"I have to agree with most of the negative reviewers on here, this really is a rather poor product since it doesn't always work. The main problem is the thing is constantly dropping connection, I mean we live in a small single floor apartment so I'm not looking to go large distances with the thing and it's CONSTANTLY dropping connection. As a few other reviewers mentioned, we need to find that sweet spot in order to get it to stay connected, once we do it works great but if we move it... beep beep beep beep beep beep beep. It's really rather annoying, so annoying in fact we trashed it and bought the Safety 1st high def monitor which works MUCH better. All I can suggest is if you want to try the unit out make sure you have a good return policy. Maybe in a house it won't pick up as much interference and constantly drop connection like it does for us in a condo."
1,Poor design,"In addition to the items already listed in the reviews, I had two major issues with the monitor. First, there is no indication of volume once you push the button other than a one time beep and a flash of the front light. Secondly, is the darn beep for everything. Everytime you adjust the volume up or down, it beeps. When you are around a sleeping infant, the last thing you want is more beeps.I sent this item back after day one."
5,Digital baby monitor produces clear sound,"We really like our Graco digital iMonitor. It gives very clear sound in a good range of volumes, and has a much longer range than any analog monitors that we tried previously. We do not get quite the range that is claimed on the box--usually it reaches about 1/2 a city block, depending on the strength of charge left in the rechargeable batteries. The lights that light up for baby's sound are quite bright, which can be a problem if you like to sleep in complete darkness. I turn the monitor around so that the lights do not keep me awake."
2,Not buying another one!,When my son was about three months old my monitor began beeping and would no longer hold a charge. I went back to the store and purchased monitor #2. My son is now 8 months old and #2 is now beeping and not holding a charge. I don't think I am going to go back for #3. I should of stuck with what I knew. I used the Sony Baby Call Nursery Monitor with my twins and it worked great. I was hoping the digital monitor would work better.
1,bad sound. low battery life.,"We had to buy a second monitor for our second child. We have a Sony NTM-910 for our oldest (3yrs old) which is AWESOME-- great range, very long battery life, great sound pick up across the room. But we have a cell tower next to the house we just moved into. It causes a clicking type interference. So we got the digital graco (to avoid the clicking). This monitor is HORRIBLE. The battery lasted about 5 months before it wouldn't hold a charge longer than an hour. Even when the transmitter is close to her crib the sound is bad. It sounds like she is in a tunnel.I would NOT recommend this monitor for anyone-- get the SONY. If you have interference, THEN get a different one."
3,Great clarity and range...terrible battery,"We had a great Evenflo baby monitor that I used even when my kids got a little bigger simply because they were at an opposite room of the house. When our third son was born though, someone gave us this awesome new monitor. The clarity is great and I love that it doesn't seem to interfere with our network and other equipment we have in the house. However, after 5 months, the battery started retaining less and less of a charge. Now, we've had it over a year and it only stays charged 5 minutes off the base. It's still a great monitor and after hearing my friends struggle with theirs, I'm keeping mine and will continue to work with the battery issue. I would suggest getting the unit with two parent monitors."
5,Quiet Journey CD,"We heard one song from this CD on SoundScapes and when we found this CD on Amazon.com we were thrilled. It's very relaxing and though I'm not a big piano fan, I'm really enjoying this CD. We will certainly look for more of her music."
4,7 year old votes yes!,"Sarah, age 7, received the Leap Pad Mammal book as a birthday present and was interested in it right away. She seemed to enjoy the content and the games. Sarah says you can learn from it and it's fun!"
3,"not bad, good to hear every once in a while.","this recording is a mix of jungle-influenced beats, colorful synths, some chilled out piano and bass, tied in with very interesting and usually well placed samples.the best thing that i can say about it is that the sounds this guy uses i haven't heard before. its like he uses really old equipment, then masters it on new recording gear.its hard to compare this artist with others, but if i had to, i'd say he has some dark quality like that of the early works of AFX mixed in with a more mainstream DJ feel like Orbital, except less sophisticated.i would reccommend it to other techno musicians simply for the different noises heard throughout the cd and what one might gain from just hearing something different."
2,None too descriptive.,"This book has a few intresting concepts, but it quite frankly lacks decent descriptive talent. Also, the story never really found foundation. The back of the book had more substance than ninety percent of the pages.I could be wrong. Just my opinion."
5,A delightful ABC/123 book in rhyme,"I, too, am searching for another copy of this classic from my childhood. I read my 30-year-old copy to our first child almost every day for a year until the back cover fell off. The rhyme and rhythm of the writing and the colorful illustrations keep children's attention and help them to memorize each letter verse."
3,"Fun Game for all ages, plastic pieces fall apart","We loved this game, a party favorite for the kids. Unfortunately the plastic checkers split apart and the the size of the checkers are impossible to find replacements for. I would not buy this game again unless they change the design of the checker pieces."
2,Feels cheap,the plastic frame is flimsy and the chips are hollow. It would've been nice if they were a hard plastic. you get what you pay for.
5,Fun Game,This is a lot of fun. Kids loved that it was a jumbo size. Lots of fun with it. Very pleased w/ product.
3,Read and Enjoy the Accompaniment of Music Together.,"This relaxing compilation of mostly sonatas are representative of Brahms' moody, gentle ruminations and meditations on love and life. These selections highlight the intimate Brahms, most famous for his lullaby (cradle song), baring his soul in music which is warm, friendly, and beautiful.This music is 'laid back;' it has secrets but is in no hurry to reveal them. It's like reading a novel where things are seldom what they seem at the beginning. It subtly works its way into the consciousness with its tender beauty. The moderate, easy-going gait of the music puts the listener into a relaxed mood, perfect for reading. By the time the reader reaches the end of the story, changes have occurred. As it is in novels, it is in the music of the romantic period. This one will help you to unwind at the end of a busy day."
1,Returned it,"Did not come in the case that was originally pictured. Was not plug n play as stated. Could not retrieve information -- got ""file corrupted"" message instead of my pictures. Sorry, guys."
4,A great value for your money.,"The Tchaikosky Album it is a very good way to get a glimpse of some of Tchaikovsky's most famous works as seen by a very good director and orchestra like Solti and the Chicago Symphony; all the works in the double CD are well-known, but to me, the highlight is the Romeo and Juliet Fantasy Overture, which is outstanding. The Nutcracker and Swan Lake suites are also included here, and they are well-executed, without too much flash or too little spirit. In general, this is a very good record at a very good price, but if you are looking for the best Tchaikosvky that you can find, you better look elsewhere."
5,Clear and concise book of Java. Indispensable !!,This book is very clear an concise about Java programing language. Experts programers need look this books for reference and newbies for art of programing in Java Language
2,Too much flack plus imprecise language,"I did not like this book much at all. It contains an excessive amount of Microsoft-style flack where deficits are described as advantages. Also, the metalanguage used to describe the object-oriented elements of Java keeps changing from page to page in a very disconcerting way.There is a surprising incidence of just plain incorrect English, by anyone's grammar book, in addition to a good bit of fog. The lack of verbal precision gives me the distinct feeling that the author, Naughton, was not an actual developer of Java but rather a ""shaker and mover"" in an executive capacity.Given all that, I think that if you are not overly sensitive to flack and lack of precision you might be able to learn quite well from this book, as others have liked it very much."
3,Spread to thin to be a useful resource...let alone a HANBOOK,"In all fairness this book covers a lot of generalinformation on required java programming syntax.However, important areas like Constructors and Interfaces to name but two are not sufficiently covered to provide useful material to relate to real world needs of Java developers !"
3,"A okay broad overview, but not enough depth to stand alone","The Java Handbook isn't a bad book, if what you're lookingfor is a generic overview of Java and your goal is simplyto get a feel for what the language provides and the kindsof things you might do with it. It's a reasonably easyread, fairly entertaining at times, and the history of howJava came into being is enlightening.But the book isn't deep enough in most areas to actuallylet you start writing any but the most trivial Java appletsor applications after reading it. For that reason, I'm notconvinced this book is worth the price."
5,"Very Powerful, Slow-Building Horror Novel","If you're patient and willing to let Douglas Clegg's new book perform its magic upon you, you'll find that _The Hour Before Dark_ is one of the better recent horror novels. This is a very scary, very well-written novel, but it doesn't have a lot of gross-out shocks. Instead, it is a rather slow moving novel that builds and builds in suspense until a very satisfying climax and conclusion. I've read Clegg's work before and been disappointed by it, but in all fairness, I must say that this book finally lives up the hype I've read about him. An excellent book which was hard to put down--in fact, I read it in one sitting. Highly recommended!"
3,Not recommended,"Sorta lame, bad ending, did not keep my interest. I would not recommend this book, and I'll stick with Koontz."
2,Very very slow,"Wow! This is slow. I like Douglas Clegg generally but this particular novel, ugh! The last 1/4 of the book picked up but by then it was a little to late. The ending, very predictable."
2,Subtle horror? It doesn't work.,There is only one thing worse than buying a terrible book and having to throw it away in the realization that you have just wasted money that could have been spent on a good book. That alternate frustration is to force yourself to finish a terrible book because the author teases you with the possibility that something interesting or entertaining might happen near the end. Douglas Clegg teases but never delivers.
1,... slow,"This is very slow book, the idea is not original which is fine since horror is limited scope but the treatment is poor. I think yo ushould skip this. Ramsey Campbell, Christopher pike wrote better books on the subject. I would say this is PG-13 book. There is a slim linr between horror and comedy. Example is 'Dracula' by F.F.Copola and by Mel Brooks. This is more like Brooks's movie."
1,Yuck!,I disliked this book so much that I tore it into tiny pieces and used it to start my fireplace. There wasn't anything I enjoyed about this story at all!
2,Not all that good,"I was very disappointed with this Book. Badly written, and uninteresting. Comparisons to Stephen King way off the mark. To be fair I haven't read anything else by Douglas Clegg."
3,ok reading,"Hi - this book is one I read a few years ago and again recently. I feel it was an honest attempt to relate the story of Yvon - but I do feel that more of it should have dealt with the challenges he faced in his boxing career - and less to depict his personality - or the way the author perceived him. The book would have been more intriguing if the reader could 'see' the lifestyle and era that Yvon lived through - for example look at the popularity of Frank McCourt's books - T'is and Angela's Ashes - the style used there would be better used in depicting the story of Yvon - and his wife and kids too. I was a little dissapointed in the sensationalism of negative things in Yvon's life rather than portraying the 'whole picture"". The culture, lifestyle, and sense of family and pride is not shown as well as it should be."
3,lots of cool features but not thatgreat,"it had lots of extras like purple floors beaded dorrs,elevqator etc,and still had all the basics so if you wanted to play ""basic"" sims you could.it wasnt all that fun party wise i mean its okay but not awesome.I woudlnt recomend buying it buy livin large"
1,Too Sleezy,I thought we were trying to teach our kids to stay away from Raves. Who would promote a game for teens that encourages a setting for the perfect rave party? Not to mention the sleezy dance cage. I'm embarressed that any moral family would consider this good entertainment for anyone in their family.
3,An okay expansion for a great game,"Frankly I was a little disappointed in this expansion; certainly it doesn't compare to ""Livin' Large"" in terms of fun potential, but it has some neat new stuff.The party option in my case almost always seems to bring the cops AND the mime, and does little to improve relationships.Some of the new goodies are fun, but some areas seem woefully neglected. We have a zillion variations of the 'tropical island wallpaper' theme but still only 2 sinks and one counter for the bathroom? You guys, consult with an architect or interior designer! More beds! More 'love' beds! More architectural styles!Make the computers do more! Let the SIMs email, meet people online... buy stuff!And most importantly, more pets. The guinea pig is too dangerous. Make birds, make some ambulatory pets, like cats and dogs that function sort of like real SIM characters!The SIMs still has a TON of untapped potential!"
5,Pioneers of British hard rock,Heritage have been described as 'forgotten heroes of the NWOBHM scene.' Their debut Remorse Code displays a fine sense of musicianship and well crafted songs. A must for any fans of good old rock n roll!
3,not original,"The aerobic section is the exact workout that was marketed under Gilad's ""Fat burning workout"". It was made about 1990 and was sold VHS."
5,"Your buns, legs & abs will be on fire!","Somewhat simple yet effective exercises. When I first started, I could not get through the entire program, I had to pause to catch my breath during the aerobics session and I could not complete half of the toning exercises. With each day, I became stronger and with each day I completed more of the exercises. I like to alternate between the two sessions, so I end up doing something each day. Gilad is fun to follow and gives clear directions on what to do. Nice warm-up routines, too!"
4,Nicely packaged workout,"I am a big fan of Gilad's workout routines and wanted one in particular that didn't depend on weights that I could use when traveling. This one is pretty good for that purpose, particularly the toning portion. When I have ready access to a gym, I've been using the toning sections of Gilad's ""Quickfit"" series which I can highly recommend. This one is a little less comprehensive, but would get the job done if you mainly want a solid program that can be done in less than an hour and that doesn't require weights."
3,feel a bit mislead,"I love the newer Gilad from his show on FitTV, but this is from 1980's. This is high-impact aerobics. However, if you can physically do this sort of workout, it is challenging and will get you in the best shape ever."
5,Gamera Double Feature,"In ATTACK OF THE MONSTERS, Gamera, a full fledged good guy, faces off with Guiron. Though he is wounded by Guiron in the first go-around, Gamera rallies to defeat Guiron. He then repairs the spaceship that brought Tom and Akio to Guiron's home planet and brings the boys back home to Earth.In GAMMERA THE INVINCIBLE, a nuclear explosion awakens Gammera, a 200 foot fire-breathing turtle, and he goes on a destructive rampsge. Gammera stops by a nuclear plant to recharge his energy and it is soon learned that Gammera is not at all invulnerable. An experimental freezing bomb is used on Gammera and it does what it is supposed to do, but Gammera eventually escapes.Gammera is lured by fire to a nearby island and he is trapped inside a capsule and sent to Mars."
5,Best baby towels ever,"These towels are nice and thick and will wrap completely around a small child because the hood is at the center of the towel and not at the corner. They are thick enough that you won't get wet carrying a wet child wrapped up in one. I do not use any other towels for my little one. They also are very well made, the ones I have are still in perfect shape after two years of heavy usage. Also if you look on-line it is pretty easy to find good deals on them especially if you aren't too particular on color. Everyone I know who has a baby will be getting one of these towels from me as a shower gift."
3,leaves fuzzies on baby's skin,"The towel is big and soft enough, but it leaves fuzzies on my kid's skin. I find I don't use it as much as the towels I got from LL Bean because of this. It wasn't anything special. The towels from LL Bean are the same price and bigger and leave no fuzzies behind. I'm not going to buy more from this company. I wasn't that impressed with this product. If you are looking for hooded towels, check out LL Bean."

1,history of pop music,some might say there was no music before the beatles right except classical of course some would say oasis are their followers not in terms of quality in fact macartney opened the door to brilliant acts like the moody blues electric light orchestra &4aces airsupply asia alan parsons project&america
5,anna4oasis,What more can I say than this is classic oasis. It's a must have for any oasis fan. Oasis are the best band and all their music rocks!
4,Great producto for Oasis fans,"If you are an Oasis fan you would love it. However, if you are only looking for something new about Oasis I will not recommend you to buy it. It is basically a review of their best songs, at least according to them with the addition of a dvd with an interview to Noel and Liam"
4,Very good....but...,"Excluding 'Don't Go Away' & 'I Hope, I Think, I Know' makes me realize that they hated 'Be Here Now' as much as most people. But damn they were the best songs in that disaster!"
3,Oasis Drying Up,"I remember in the mid-90's when the brothers Gallagher proclaimed that they would be the ""next Beatles"". An interesting thought, but their dream fell far short of reality. In fact, had ""Stop The Clocks"" not been released, they would have faded into obscurity at a faster rate. Overall, I do like the singles/B-sides this project has assembled. ""Stop The Clocks"" will attract those who once remembered Oasis as a decent band from the U.K. with a few catchy tunes. The clock ticks on............."
1,Ugh,"I've run out of patience. I stuck with 'em through Be Here Now and everything after. They said some great song called Stop the Clocks was going to be on this. There's an acoustic rocker that plays in the trailer for their upcoming movie. There's a nice melodic slow moving number that plays on a different trailer. So...in the end...what do we get? A lazy mix tape of stuff we all already have. I understand greatest hits albums are made up of songs that were already released. And they get one star for re doing a song. However, I never thought I'd see the day that I'd give Oasis one star. Unfortunately, today's the day. It's simply out of disappointment. These days it seems they're doing a little too much talking and not enough walking. Mad ferit? Barely."
1,Dated oldies by Hibari.,"There are two CDs. Disc-one has twenty-four selections and disc-two has nineteen. Completely Westernized, nothing Japanese about these selections except the language and Hibari does sing several songs in English. All the selections have loud ""hisses"" and ""pops"" all through the recordings because of their age. All the cuts sound like old 78-records. Purchasing this CD without hearing samples would be a mistake."
2,Rather superficial,"Ms Crocetti's time in the UAE was evidently not sufficient for her to form a very deep impression of the country. Many of her comments (which I often found to be smug and over-definitive) refer to features of Arab society which can be understood within a short time frame, and a number I simply felt I had to disagree with. I would also question some of her figures - her population statistics in particular. The book is not really suitable for business travellers, who would need a more serious and commerce-oriented guide. However, for Westerners arriving in the UAE for the first time, especially at the start of a period of residence, this is a useful basic introduction."
2,She Only Told The Truth!,"For all you who think of The UAE as A good Place, read This book, She only tells the truth."
3,Would have been better as an instrumental,"This guy is an amazing musician, he rolls his fingers all over that guitar like rain rolls of a rooftop. The music is out of this world and all one can do and sit there and marvel in it.However, he failed to create any real lasting melodies to go with the songs. They just kind of linger there without having anything to say.Once the vocals are added in the musician is saying ""ok, the music was important at first, but now listen to my voice."" And once he does that, there should be some other way to keep you hooked into it. This is where he failed on this album."
2,Skips and a poor design,"This is an adequate player, but it skips easily and the control buttons are tiny with illegible markings. A big disappointment."
1,Another piece of China-made trash. Forget it. Go for quality.,"You get what you pay for. This unit skips, does not provide for a ppause feaature. Forget any mute function. It's disappointing to see the way a reputable company like Amazon is peddling this electronic junk."
1,Forget about using it as an mp3 CD player.,"The hardware on the player is OK other than that the buttons are basically unlabeled. There's tiny lettering, white on white, that can only be read under a microscope. The display isn't much better.So much for the good news. The bad news is that the software is among the worst I've ever seen anywhere on any product. For the most part, this is NOT an mp3 player. It ignores the track number tag on mp3, and insists that you name all your tracks ###name.mp3 or else it'll play them out of order.Once an mp3 is playing, you can't fastforward or rewind. I've haven't seen anything so primitive in the last twenty years of personal electronics."
2,Queen Amidala,I am not satisfied with the Amidala custome that I purchase coz some of the excess threads are not cleanly cuts.
2,Not that great,"I mean jeez the view sucs evn though you can change it,but when you do change it it feels like worse control,good graphics,ok gameplay,but really gets boring,if your into star wars, for the love of god dont get this."
1,Don't waste your time,I currently own about 7 PS2 titles and this is one of the onlygames I have purchased that I didn't bother going very far with.It is very repetitive and there just isn't enough to do. I findit hard to believe that it has such a high rating. I am 37 and I recently let my 25 year old friend play it on his PS2 and he feltthe same way as me... pretty weak game. Not very fun at all. It is not something you will rush home to play and get engrossed with.
5,A FUN RIDE,"I've played alot of flying simulation games, but this is far the best, enjoyable, entertaining, exciteing, buteiful graphics and it's fairly understanable flying techniqs makes it a must have.NES Starfox has'nt the time killer abilities like Star Wars Starfighter. I sat down and played it for what seem an hour but really 3 to 4 hours of play. I'ts that addictive and not at all boreing but ah thrill ride you'd expect from PS2. Trully a wonderful expiernce in gameing history."
3,"Amazing, but WAY! too short","Within 5 seconds this game pulled me in. The ships are amazing the combat spectacular and the story exciting. For once even some of the characters are really cool, the alien ones of course. Overall this game is really amazing. Some of the missions have so many enemy ships flying around it really is incredible to see.The problems with the game are a couple of stupid missions. The cliche canyon run is so over done as to be utterly dull. Every Starwars game has a canyon run. And the other cliche, the fly inside a ship. They don't even make any sense. The space missions were the best and gave the best feel of flying a starfighter.But the biggest problem is the game is totally short. 2 hours of play and I had finished. 2 hours and it's all over. Just when things seem to be getting exciting it's over.Overall it's a good and fun game. But it's length is a real drawback. They are on the right track. But not there yet."
1,1 star for Star Wars Starfighter,"A few words for my fellow gamers, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. This game's stages are repetitive and boring, very little challenge. This game brings nothing new, it doesn't even take full advantage of the grafic power of playstation 2. This game's story line is dull & lame. This game SUCKS. When I bought it at the store, they gave me 2 options: Buy a new one, or a used one for $10 less. I thought to my self ""Used? Already?"" MMMMMhhhhhhhhhh....Maybe it's not good...but what the heck, it's only $39"". What a moron!!! I should have kept my money and bought myself a yo-yo!!! Or put $10 extra and buy Z.O.E. with the Metal Gear Solid 2 playable demo. Please don't make my same mistake. RENT IT BEFORE YOU BUY IT!!! PLEEEAAASE!!!"
3,ROGUE LEADER >>> STARFIGHTER,"I wasn't impressed neither with the game play w/ Starfighter nor the difficulty of the game. I thought Rogue Leader PC version game and it's sequel for Gamecube is three times better in plot, graphics, and gameplay. In my eyes, this was a dissappointment to Lucas fans. Games like Jedi Knight Two: Jedi Outcast, Rogue Squadron II: Rogue Leader, and Bouty Hunter, so far, are the best."
3,Good Graphics but hard to control,"I've played the demo of this game and I do like it, but it's hard for me to control. I can never get the plane to stop completely, and have a hard time not crashing into rocks while trying to destroy enemies on the ground. It's fun blowing up the things, but at times it is frustrating."
4,Jedi Starfighter is better,"This game is well made. It has good graphics and gameplay. There are even a FEW missions which can be played 2 player. However, the new Jedi Starfighter game is twice as fun, and you can play all the missions 2 player on it. If you own neither one I suggest skipping this one and going right for Jedi Starfighter."
4,Fun game but slow start,When I bought this game I saw how great all the reviews were. Since I was a mediocre Star Wars fan I went ahead and purchased it. The graphics are amazing but the first few levels are extremely boring. All they really do is get you used to the controls and I pretty much got them down after the first level. Anyway the game has a story to it which is slightly interesting but the real fun comes when you get to the other levels on hard and you find yourself in a very chaotic battle. You've got tanks all over the ground slowly moving toward your base and they're firing at you while your trying to keep fighters out. And during that more dropships come in launching more tanks and then in the middle of it when all hell has broken lose one of your wingmen asks you to take care of some side goal. The game is pretty short but if you want some intense battles then you should try this one out.
4,The Best shoot em-up on PS2,...I also don't really go for starwars games but this game was an exception. To me the game plays like the incredible starfox game back on the snes but without the end level bosses. The graphics are incredible detailed I can't emphasis on how good looking the game is. And with the gameplay it almosts matches to how the game looks with smooth realistic movement of the ships. The draw back with this game is that the framerate tends to drop a bit when there is quite a lot of ships on screen and the fact that the actual game is a bit short. But with how the game plays it would't bother you. I can say I got a classic game worth of 15. this is a must for any starwars fans and a must for any shoot em-up fans the game is a class.
2,Needs Some Work,"To tell you the truth, I disapprove of this game. I like the graphics, yes, but I strongly sugggest one of the other Star Wars games. It isn't very fun because of the difficulty of dodging enemy fire. The level in the desert is my favorite. Other things that I like are how it is:(1) in third person(2) starship weapons(3) nice graphicsI suggest that Lucas Arts puts in squad-based air fighting or make the game a litle easier and longer. Still, I am a big fan of Star Wars. Good luck on the next game Lucas Arts!"
4,ALMOST PERFECT!,"out of all the star wars game every made this ranks up there with rougue squadron as one of the best. visually the game is top notch, finally theres a game worth the money out for ps2. My only complaint is that the game is somewhat simple, and there are to few missions, but that aside right now this is the best game available for ps2...well worth the money a must own."
3,Fantastic game but a little short,"The game starts out very slowly but heats up after the 3rd or 4th mission. After that, it's a non-stop rollercoaster of Star Wars mayhem! You will actually feel like you're in the Star Wars universe. The battles are intense, with an incredible amount of enemies onscreen at once.The missions are actually quite long, most lasting over seven to eight minutes. This can be a hinderance in some cases, for the levels start out easy, become insanely difficult at the end, thus forcing you to start from the beginning each time you die.The control over the ship is intuitive. The voice acting is ranges from satisfactory to downright outstanding. The movie scenes border on adequate to slightly sub-par.Star Wars fans should buy this right now, all others should rent it immediately. It's just not quite long enough to warrant a purchase for nonfans of the series."
4,Could Be Better,"This game is pretty cool and has great graphics but you onlyget to fly three ships (unless you have codes, then you can fly DarthMauls infultrater), and most of the levels are not that complex, butit's still a good game. Regardless of what you may have heard, thecontrols are fine and the game has a few bonus levels and twomultiplayer missions to unlock. The following are some good pointsabout the game: great graphics, good action, several different kindsof levels including bonus levels,fun to play, even after you beat it,and if you can unlock it, Darth Mauls infultrater rocks. So over all Iwould say this game is good but could be better..."
3,Great sound and graphics...needs improvement,"First thing that I noticed about the game is the wonderful graphics and sound. Everything flows seamlessly. Controls are good although the targeting system can be a little tricky. One drawback to the game is the boundaries. There is nothing more irritating than having your ship suddenly move you off course to keep you in the boundary especially while chasing enemy planes. This game is pretty challangeing but, it could have some more missions as well as a multiplayer without having to beat the game first. I enjoyed having more than one character to choose from as well as the excellent movie scenes.Overall, You should rent this game before buying."
3,"Beautiful graphics, great music score, controls need work.","Just like I said, the graphics are beautiful, the music score is exciting and the sound quality is very good overall. The missions are relatively easy. I finished the game in 3 days and returned it. I found the first and final missions to be the most difficult, but once you get a handle on the controls, success is around the corner. I think once you finish the game, replay value is low. I wish the missions had been a bit more challenging and complex. It's the best Star Wars game so far, but I found it difficult at times to maneuver the flight controls. Basically, flight simulation needs work, but overall a fun game. For hardcore gamers, this game is a definite rental, but for you Star Wars fans, it's worth the investment. Definitely stay away from the Star Wars Bombad Racing game. That was a disappointment! Go M's! I-chi-ro! I-chi-ro! I-chi-ro!"
1,Screaming banshee and fashion model,"This horrible, horrible recording has been around for some years now, and, like malaria, it seem to plague the human race.Filippa Giordano is not a singer. She is just some pretty Italian girl with a big ego and no vocal talent whatsoever. Avoid like the plague, unless you feel like shocking your friends or using this CD as a room-clearer at the end of a party."
1,Depressed,"This is a hideous conflation of bad taste, inept singing and inappropriate orchestration. One of the worst I have ever heard. The screeching B flats in Casta Diva, the groaning 'scooping' in O Mio Babbino Caro will, I am sure, have made Puccini and Bellini turn in their graves. What on earth makes this woman think she can sing great music. Her arrogance is breathtaking. If she must sing, other than in her bath, could she please concentrate on areas that are not so convincingly beyond her musical and vocal capacity."
1,Do not get overwhelmed by background,"This cd is sort of like a new age cd in the sense that keyboards are used in the background kind of a-la Enya. You might say that the arrangements are new age arrangements to famous opera arias. The voice on this cd is TERRIBLE. First, the girl cannot reach the notes on some crucial moments and seems to lead you to inanition. To convince you I strongly recommend you get a cd of Renee Flemming or even Callas. There are cd's of those singers that have almost the same repertoire as this one. You will notice that Giordano sometimes screams rather then sing. Try and compare. The only thing nice about this cd is the arrangements. Those I am sure you will like even if you might not had heard the arias before."
1,Italy's Revenge,"Walking though a British store I noticed that a ""talking fish"" from the US was a hot Christmas item. I wondered what Europe did to merit such punishment from us. Five minutes later I heard this CD being blasted over a very hi-fi speaker. All I can say, it serves them right. How awful! I picture myself tied to a chair and forced to listen to this caterwauling, yodeling soprano. Stop! I confess! I did it! I didn't do it! Do it to Julia! Please stop this woeful singing. Billy Bass sounds better."
1,Distasteful....,"Do Banshees really exist ?. Yes they do.....and this abomination of musical history is proof of this....I cannot believe that a record company actually thought that they would even remotely break even on the sales of this grievous, flavorless, repellent and not to mention nauseous anathema of a recording. Shame on you young lady for destroying what were once, beautiful arias. A sad and unpassionate insult to great musical workmanship...."
4,"Not really opera, but fun anyway","As previous reviewers have said, ""purist"" opera fans would probably not consider this album to be opera, but it's still very enjoyable. Filippa Giordano will not likely be cast in a Wagnerian role anytime soon; she has a beautiful voice, but it does sound rather thin at times (she's no Maria Callas or Renee Fleming, in other words). It would be very easy to compare her to those other ""(p)opera"" divas, Sarah Brightman and Charlotte Church, but Filippa's sound is considerably more playful than Sarah's, and more sophisticated than Charlotte's. The highlights of this album are her renditions of ""Casta Diva"" and ""Habanera,"" and I would recommend it for those two songs alone, but the rest of the album is also very good. This would be a great way to introduce a young person to the genre, as many of the songs could pass for pop songs."
3,"Opera Geeks, get a life","This is an album by a gifted pop singer singing some beautiful classical arias. Now, opera geeks are going apoplectic that this woman has the temerity to do so. I listen to opera, and I am occasionally relieved to hear CDs like this. It's nice not to hear a singer sounding like several people are tightening her Wagnerian corset so hard that she is expelling air through every orifice in her body. It is not the music that keeps opera unaccessible to everyone except pretentious pseudo-intellectuals (you don't need a Ph.D. to appreciate it). No, what has kept opera out of the mainstream is the constipated sounds too many opera singers make. If you like beautiful music sung well, if not brilliantly, you will like this CD. And for the record, I loathe C?line Dion's and Whitney Houston's music passionately, so don't let the first reviewer's comments dissuade you from this CD."
1,"Her intention is the problem, not her voice ................","With so many one star reviews here, it is clear that there is a problem. But I think people are missing what the problem is. Filippa has a lovely voice, especially in the high register, but when this cd was released she didn't know how to use it, and maybe she still doesn't. All through this cd she sings to impress, not to communicate. Many artists have done that on their first album, trying to ensure a successful recording career, and many more will do it in the future.She screams at times to indicate passion, but passion does not need to be indicated, it just needs to be felt and projected by a disciplined voice. There is no discipline here, and no feeling. Just a good voice being used (she thinks) as an advertisement of how good she is. But if you are thinking about the result (as performers in all walks of life will tell you) you will not do what you are there to do, and you will fail, as she does here."
4,Want Goosebumps?,"Buy this fine cd if only for A Little on the Lonely Side. Try listening to Patty's heartbreaking vocals without getting goosebumps. And oh yeah, the other songs are quite good too. Hits found here are If My Heart Had Windows and A Little Bit in Love."
5,Martin: Complete Seasons Three & Four,"This is a must have collection just like the other seasons. If you are a true fan of the show or Martin Lawrence, then you should buy and if not, you should give it a try because you won't go wrong. I have every season and are still laughing as if its the first time seeing."
1,not happy w/ amazon,I have been waiting almost a month for my dvd's. I received season 1 and 2 weeks ago. I should have been recieved my dvds that I paid for the same day I ordered them!! What is the hold up!?
