2,"Has ""The Punisher Feel"" but weres ""The Punisher""","This movie was the thing that attracted me to the comics at the age of 7. Yet now today I realize that it really was disapointing. The film yes in a way had faith to the comic, but were was the Punisher. You cannot expect to put Lundgren in a film and get away with it on top of that trying to sneek passed the iconic skull emblum on the shirt. First I dont like martial art films, and this movie had revolving around a Japanesse mob, so thats not a another goodie. So yeah a good thanks to Jon Hensleigh for makin the new one."
1,Dig a hole and bury this one,"This adaptation of The Punisher was really weak. Truely, there is nothing great about this movie at all. This movie is a total slap in the face to all Marvel fans everywhere because the name of the Punisher was dragged through the mud, shoved into an incenerator and chopped up by a rusty carving knife.First and foremost, the Punisher is NOT some bum who lives in the sewers. He's a vigilante who takes the law into his own hands. That and the script is awful! You can't tell me that you could be impressed with this one.I give it a zero. This movie should not have been made and if you want the real Punisher, read the comics because you'll never get the true feel in this bad job of a movie."
2,Very forgettable.,This movie was very mediocre performances were flat (which is nothing new for Dolph) even Lou Gosset Jr was poor. I retained very little about this movie and near fell asleep watching it. I would more highly recommend the newer version starring Thomas Jane and John Travolta.
3,Good but not the Punisher,I liked this movie a lot but it just didn't seem like the Punisher. I saw this movie halfway through on TV once and didn't even realize it was the Punisher and Punisher is my favorite comic book character. Lundgren fits the part of Punisher well though and the story is pretty good and you get a lot of good action scenes. Can't wait for the new one coming out.
4,VERY GOOD FOR WHAT IT IS,At the time this movie was made Marvel comics was not not really backing any of their chairacter in the film area. The Punisher was the first movie that was made and actually had marvel endorsing it. It was featured in many comics at the time withe the release of the video. There was even a comic adaptation of the film. This was a low budget movie but very enjoyable at the time. Of the three movies based off the character this is the one many consider the best.
4,The Punisher Rules!!!,"I hate to say this, but this version is a little bit better than the 2004 version. It has a lot more action and more killing off bad guys. It's been five years since Frank Castle's family died, and he is getting his revenge and punishing all the corrupt people and mafia. This reminds me a lot of Max Payne, which is one of my favorite games. The only downfall of this movie is that the Punisher doesn't wear his famous skull shirt. If you love action, you'll love THE PUNISHER!!!"
4,Not Bad,"Not bad considering that Marvel Comics Company did not lend a hand with this film. They did the best with what they had. I think Dolph Lundgren did a great Job portaying the Punisher and in my opinion he should have played the Punisher in the new Punisher Movie instead of Thomas Jane, don't get me wrong Thomas did a good job playing the role of the Punisher, he just did not look enough like the Punisher, Dolph resmbles the punisher a great deal and played the role almost to perfection. But this version of the punisher does have it's faults like for example Dolph's version of the Punisher does not display the Trade Mark Skull on his shirt, and the movie took place in australia instead of New York. But overall the Movie was pretty good considering the lack of help from Marvel. Louis Gossett Jr. also played a good part in this movie, The new Punisher is a little more accurate than this version, but this movie is still a must get and see."
1,i wanna see a remake of punisher,"To start off, this is a cheesy movie. This is a big dissapointment to marvel comics and a slap in the face to the fans, they really weren't going for the comic appeal in this movie. They only made this movie so they could try to make money off the name punisher and they didn't do well with that, Punisher is one of my favorite comic books and since they made all these other comic book movies like Spider-Man, DareDevil, X-Men, The Hulk and i think the punisher should be remade and everyone would go see it, I wanna see punisher remade cause it would be a cool ... movie and it can a sweet anti-hero movie and go for the comic appeal this time and wear the skull and get a cool actor to play him."
2,So bad it's almost good!,"B-Movie is definitely the way to describe this film. The dialogue is cheesy, the storyline cliche and the lead character never really develops a second dimension.But despite knowing all of this, I had to buy the DVD.I grew up on comic books and The Punisher was always one of my favourites. The movie is bad, but it's still a lot of fun. There is some decent acting in the film (Louis Gossett, Jr.), although Dolph Lundgren barely says 3 words. If you're a fan of B-movies and comic books, this one is definitely worth buying (especially at its current sale price).As for the DVD, it really doesn't have much in it. The quality of picture and sound is below average (although about what you'd expect from a transfer of a late-80s movie. There are basically no extras on the DVD (it only contains the trailer, cast bios and a few pages of production notes).Oh well - it was fun to watch again! :)"
3,fun,this is an awesome dolph flick. the punisher punishes the guilty and the corpses pile up. having the punishers old partner involved is a good idea and the kidnapping of mobster's kids and the yazuka are good plot devices too. these all make for an interesting story. check it out.
3,Watch out for falling samurai,"The best part of the movie: While fighting 2 yakuza dressed in samurai armor, Dolph kicks one backwards, as he falls you see some sort of sword display on the ground. The display is a good 5 feet away and in the opposite direction of the fall, the camera cuts to Dolph, and then back to the yakuza who is impaled on the display. Apparently he bounced when he hit the ground and then landed on the blades, we'll never know, but I think thats good enough for an extra *"
4,Dolph Is The Punisher!,"This One is definately one of Dolph's best. there are a lot of stunts and explosions and Dolph looks too cool in his leather outfit. the movie sticks close to the marvel hero of the same name. only I'd like to have a better, more interesting finale. still, Dolph is excellent and I give it 4/5. the DVD is very well done. one of the best DVD's from an independant studio to come out in years. go buy it."
4,Almost as good as the comic !,"This Film is Semi- faithful to the comic. But, where is his skull symbol? You at least have to put that in the movie! Dolph Lundgren was not a real good pick. If You like Marvel,pick this movie up! Anyway,the thing I really hated was that his family was killed in a car bombing instead of in central park by mobsters.If you are a comic book\action person,then buy this film!"
1,junk,"I bought this item in May 2004. It worked for awhile when I recorded my tapes onto discs. Now if I record a disc, it won't play in other DVD players, nor this one. Also, if I record a show and want to continue to record onto the disc later, it doesn't work and the disc is useless. When recording, it has frozen many times--like if you want to cut out commercials. The player will not play many discs previously recorded on this player. Do NOT waste your money. I don't care how cheap this product gets. Cheap is what it is. It's not worth it!!!"
5,Best Buy,"Let me tell you about this great DVD recorder! The playback picture is super clear; hard to tell what's original and what's been recorded.The sound is also very nice.Earlier this year, I ordered an off-brand DVD recorder and had to sell it quickly because of the horrible playback.But, the Gateway was well worth every penny and it was very reasonable in costs!I give this Gateway DVD a 10!"
1,It is bad....really bad,I can only say DO NOT BUY IT if you are lucky works for few months then is problem after problem...save yourself a headache
1,JUNK,"Since day one this machine has functioned poorly. Most DVD's won't playback, if they do the system freezes (no FF, RW or chapter skip). This is not a ventilation problem either. The recording functions have been fine but if this is going to be your only means of DVD playback skip it."
1,"Returned it, kept my VCR","Had to return it, my old Samsung VCR was much better (and of course more reliable) than this, I didn't want to go for an expensive one (when decided to upgrade to DVD recording), well to save money, but I wasted my valuable time. I don't know if it is the problem with new (DVD) + format or it is the Gateway. Anyways, I don't recommend it if you look for quality."
1,Gateway AR230 Progressive-Scan DVD Player/Recorder,"I went through two of these and neither worked. The first would record for about a half hour and then stop, showing ""write fail"" as a message. The second one did even worse - not only did it start off with ""write fail"", it quickly got to the point where it could not even locate the disc. This experience cost me about $44 in return postage expenses, only to end up with a partcial credit - I had to spend more time on the phone with Amazon to straighten that out. Bad experience all the way around."
4,Fun and quirky,"I love the dynamic mix of songs on this album. I think the Duhks shine most in their lyrical songs, so there are one too many instrumentals in this album for my taste, but it's worth the dough."
5,"If you like folk music, you cant ask for better",found this band because of the song Anabelle used on the AMC series Hell on Wheels. The records is amazing throughout. Even mix of instrumental tracks and tracks with vocals. There is only 1 track i occationally skip.
5,And how do they get the mint flavoring on toothpicks?,"And why do we kiss under mistletoe? And why are blueprints blue? I can think of no other book which is brave enough to answer these questions. Fans of the other ""Imponderables"" books will not be disappointed by this one, as it is similar in nature to the rest of the series. Readers who have never before delved into the realm of Imponderables are also in for a treat. ""Why Do Dogs Have Wet Noses?"" is light, clever, and just plain funny. However, I must warn you that you may possibly learn something from it. Who would have thought that a book that is basically a series of odd questions and answers could be so thoroughly enjoyable?"
4,Earl King on Imperial,"The late Earl King was best known for his Ace recordings for Johnny Vincent. His few singles for Imperial were overlooked. Unfortunately he joined Imperial as they were about to be sold to Liberty. There are great originals here that should have been hits like Trick Bag, Mama & Papa and Come On but lacked the promotion they deserved. An interesting look into 60s New Orleans r&b."
5,Great book,"This book is written off of family, friend, and witness accounts. The author actually traveled around and talked to people who would know more about Hardin than just a newspaper clipping. If you want a much more accurate depiction of Hardin, I recommend this book."
4,Fantastic Way To Remember The Patriots First 2 Championships,"Unlike the 2001 season DVD, this one has a lot more footage but I wish they had even more behind the scenes footage in the locker room. Aside from that, the recap of all the games is very good and it details a great playoff season as well. Solid DVD and any Patriots fan will not be disappointed!!**** RECOMMENDEDIf you are a Patriots fan there is no way you cannot enjoy this DVD reliving the magical 2001 season, the ""Snow Game"", and Super Bowl XXXVI.The only problem I have with this DVD is it's too short -- every Super Bowl DVD after this one has hours of footage instead of just an hour but you will NOT be disappointed with what is on this disc!!**** HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"
5,beautiful day,"a very nice combination of pop,jazz,funk and soul.vocals and instrumental on a very high level !!"
5,Change is Good,"While this is a different direction from Even More, it's awesome!I love the song Good Enough because it's about how we don't have to feel Good Enough to be loved by God. Yes, it's more rocky and CCM, but the messages are clear. Anthony Evans is still annointed and He's definitely grown. I highly reccomend this CD for Anthony Evans. Change is good. :)"
4,Geared towards younger children.,This CD's songs are geared more towards younger children since it is a soundtrack but has some fun cool songs.Hawaii
2,not really a great hit,"I rated this soundtrack a 2star because the songs weren't great.The one I liked the most was""Take me there"".Others like the busta rimes and stuff just seemed like added room on the cd!But the movie was the best and so are all the RUGRATS!"
2,Not That Good,"I really didn't enjoy this CD. I bought it, thinking that there would be more songs like ""Take Me There."" I was completely WRONG! ""TMT"" is the only real good song on the CD. I thought the one w/Dawn Robinson, Lisa Loeb, etc. would be good, but its just people talking to music. A couple of the songs (""A Gift From A Bob"" and ""A Bottle Of Yum"") were cute, but nothing I'd listen to over and over. And some songs were downright annoying, like Busta Rymes, the Lisa Stone song, and the song Tommy sings. Buy the ""Take Me There"" single (if there IS one, I'm not sure), and leave this Cd in the store."
5,Fun and Nostalgic,"This is such a fun and nostalgic soundtrack. I remember having the cassette as a kid and playing it over and over. Overall its filled with great tracks from the movie including ""Dil A Bye"" and the ever popular track ""Take Me There"" This is a must have for any hardcore 90's or Rugrats Fan."
2,Annoying,"I loved this show as a kid and still do, but I don't think the soundtrack has good music on it. The songs were mostly annoying and not something I would want to sit down and listen to. I only really liked ""Take me There."""
5,We played the cassette so much we broke it,Like the title said. We played the cassette some much we broke it. My youngest child has discovered the Rugrats and we need the music for the car. It is a great album.
4,Fun music.,"Tracks 3 & 4 are excellent. 1, 5 ,6 , 7, 10, & 12 are average. 2, 8, 9, and 11 are a bit ridiculous to me, but for a 'Rugrats' soundtrack, this is pretty good."
3,Somewhat okay,"It works to a certain degree, but don't expect any miracles from this product. In other words, shape tends to get a bit better after about 2-3 weeks, but those last and the most annoying 5-10 pounds are going to hold on tight."
2,Hmm?,"I couldn't get past the 100 page mark. The storyline was interesting, but Watson's writing style got to me. Her writing is very simple and doesn't keep you interested. You can tell she doesn't have any previous writing experience. Just because she's been reading books for 15 years doesn't mean she's gained enough experience to start writing her own book."
5,History brought alive,"Where `Lord of the Rings' is an adventure inspired by Mythology,`The White Mare' seems to draw it's inspiration from the pagan ideology of ancient Scotland.Jules Watson beautifully explores the relationship between the different cultures of that age, between the people and the earth, between man and woman during a time when two great civilizations clash not only on the battlefield but also in the way they live their lives.Her background in archeology lends itself to an authoritive description of a matriarchal society steeped in ritual and attuned with the rhythm of nature.Guided by the land, her characters navigate their way through social upheaval with the invasion of a foreign army vastly superior in technology and shows that ultimately, love can be a greater force than war.I thoroughly enjoyed this journey through time and recommended it to any who have sometimes wondered what life in a bygone age may have been like."
4,Celtic story with a different twist,"This book was full of vivid descriptions, human emotion, and the tangled results of fate. I enjoyed this book because it didn't take a straight path to get to where the story was going. I was also impressed by the fact that the author included issues that are not normally dealt with in this genre. I found this book to be quite well-rounded, with a good blend of memory and flashback. I definately look forward to the next book from this author."
5,AMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAZING!!!!!,"This book was just the best thing I've ever read, loved it from start to finish. Cant believe that anyone could give bad feedback for this, shocking!!! Jules Watson does a fantastic job in bringing the characters and landscape to life, and being someone from the Isle of Lewis (The Sacred Isle in the novel) She got everything spot on, i was really happy with her research and the use of Gaidhlig aswell, cant recommend this book more highly.....BUY IT NOW!!!!"
5,good read,"I always tell people you need to stay with the book and read thru the first 100 or so pages. the story picks up incredibly after that and I could not stop reading it.The characters are so vibrant and stay with you. you really fall in love with them. couldnt get eremon and Rhianon out of my mind when the book ended. the sequeals are incredible and I found myself smiling and crying at some poignant parts(I usually never do this).In fact this is one of my favourite series that I told my 8 yr old that when I am no longer be to read in my golden yrs,this is one book she has to read to me when the time comes.LOVE THIS BOOK.Eagerly waiting Watsom new book whicj is due out in March."
5,A Really Good Read!,"In ""the White Mare"", Jules Watson is able to transport the reader to an earlier culture and at the same time, keep the reader transfixed by the plot and the characters. Her knowledge of the time of ancient England brings the story to life. It was hard to put the book down, and I read it in one or two sittings, then re-read it to enjoy it to the fullest. Ms. Watson writes beautifully, and the book is well-edited, so there are not the frequent spelling and grammatical errors that so often mar the best of others in that genre. If you enjoy the books of Marion Zimmer Bradley, you will love this book. I can't wait to get my hands on the next in the trilogy."
5,One of the top 10 books of all time,"I am dissapointed that there are only 4 1/2 stars for this book. It does not do it justice! It deserves 5-- but not even, it should get 10!!Watson has filled a gap that had not previously been filled-- a wonderful romance that has a heroine to do the love story justice. I loved Marion Zimmer Bradley's druid novels, but they do not force you into seclusion for two days making you obsess over every last detail. I think I spent a week thinking about the book afterwards-- I could not get it out of my head."
1,Disapointed,"I picked this book up at the library and started reading . . . it seemed like it could be a good story, but it's full of sexual scenes that I personally don't want to read and try hard to avoid. Definitely not a teen book and if this what the other books are like, then I'd say, don't read them."
1,Couldn't finish,tried to read it but I could tell it was going to be too grafic for me. I wish books had ratings it would save me a lot of trouble
1,Boo!,"I'm a huge fan of Kingdom Hearts. But this game is such a let down. The card system puts me to sleep. It's incredibly annoying. I don't like cards. Any type of cards. But I love Kingdom Hearts. Unfortunately, cards ruined it. I'm looking forwards to Kingdom Hearts 2. I don't think I'll ever finish playing Chain of Memories though. Too boring."
1,THEY RUINED IT!,"Card Battle!? UGH! Horrible!Poor quality game. They ruined the quality of the original game.I only have it because I love the original and am a collector, and need complete series..."
1,Still waiting for the game,"Not sure if we like this game or not as we ordered on on November 19th, and as of today, December 23rd it has not shipped. This has happened to me before with pre-ordered stuff so I would be really cautious if you want something for a gift when you order from Amazon. In reading the other reviews it looks like this has happened to other people. Better buy it at the store, so you can be sure you get it when you need it. I thought over a month was plenty of time to receive it, but I guess I was wrong."
4,Card System Interesting But Becomes Tedious,"Chain of Memories has a great story and a new card system in this game. The card system tends to be the downfall. What really gets under my skin is that you have to search for a certain card to unlock a door or you can't progress any further in the game. If you can't find an ""8"" card, for example, you can't get through the door to the next part of the story. Finding the ""8"" card can sometimes take more than an hour to find. You have to keep killing monsters in hope that they will drop the ""8"" card to open to door. Over time, you get tired of looking. So the cards are a neat idea, and would work, if some of the cards weren't so hard to find. It kills the fun of the game. The ony reason the game has length is because of how long it takes to find cards, if not for that, the game could be beaten in half the time. So, overall I'd say that this game is fun, but can become annoying"
4,Sorta Good,Unlike most people I am okay with the card system.Again unlike most people I think they just make the monster to easy or to hard.For example I killed the Trickmaster in less then a minute because he only hit me once and I just slashed in attacks.When I had to reload he still didn't hit me!I am on Monstro and the Parasite Cage has been beating me silly.Overall the story line is easy to get along with and the game shows alot of strategy.I reccomend this game to fans of the first Kingdom Hearts.
5,"great, five star game!!","I got this game yesterday and ive already played it for four hours. The battle system in this game is unique, but even though it is different, it is still very fun. I own all of the final fantasy games and if this were one, it would definitely be my favorite."
5,Great Game,"I received this game last week and I have now beat both Sora's and Riku's story. It is actually quite difficult in Sora's story but my only complaint is how easy Riku's is, true it is harder to heal but you have no reload time on your deck and his dark mode makes enemys drop like flies. All in all though, it is a great game I hope all will play it."
2,POS,"Abandon that glimmer of hope now. I didn't, and I tarnished my view of both the GBA and the Kingdom Hearts franchise. I love Kingdom Hearts 1 and 2. They're two of my favorite games of all time, but this GBA turd isn't worthy of anyone's time. Yeah, theres a couple storyline gaps filled in, but a real fan can read a story description online. The card based system DOES ruin the game. The rest of it would be alright, but they attempted to add a new dimension on the KH fighting system and it just turns out annoying. Avoid this game."
2,Not even close to the magic of the PS2 KH,The game has a far inferior battle system compared to its predecessor and is mostly just random fights in a series of repetetive maps. The GBA version has none of the exploring that made KH a lot of fun.
5,YAYAYAYAY!!!!!!!! Kingdom Hearts for the GBA!!!!!!!!!!!,"This game looks really cool because itthe opening sequence is 3-D! For the GBA!It also has a new battle system.From what I've read, you are givencards and you use them to battle, andcreate the worlds. Some might saythat it's really just a 2-D version ofKingdom Hearts, but it isn't.It is put in the gap between Kingdom Hearts and Kingdom Hearts 2.I love this game!I so hope I get it on Dec. 7th.P.S.- It would make a great presents forChristmas or Hannukah or what ever you dofor the holidays."
5,I've played it!!,"I got a chance to preview this game a few weeks ago at Disney World (where I also got to meet Sora and hold the keyblade). It was great fun. Just don't expect the same style gameplay as the PS2 game. This game is card based and the card you use determines which attacks you use, which doors you open, and other such factors in the game. It is possibly more challenging (in terms of strategy) than KH was. At any rate... it was tremendous fun and shouldn't be missed by any KH, FF, or Disney fan."
5,Sexellent,"I don't have a Game Boy Advance, but I've been using Nintendo's Game Boy Player [...] The game is awesome, Square and Disney definitely didn't disappoint."
5,just to let you know the theme song of kingdom hearts..,When you walk away you don't hear me sayplease-- oh baby! don't go!simple and clean is the way you are making me feel tonight.it's hard to let it go..( and YES i am a girl )The Phantom Brat .:':.
5,I love this game!!!!!!!!!!!!,I must get this game IVE played the 1st kingdom hearts and it was great!!!!!!!!! Now that there is one for the gameboy I MUST GET IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,Awesome game!!,This game is amazing!! It's plays almost like the the original Kingdom Hearts for the PS2 with a new storyline. I highly recommend this game when it comes out December 7th.
5,great experience!,"Just another great shopping experience. THe game arrived perfect condition, and on the time expected.speedy delivery!!"
4,4/5,"Overall this game was pretty good even though it has its downsides. The story line was really good and pivotal for the Kingdom Hearts series. This game is card based fighting, and it does as good of a job as it could to keep it interesting. But it still gets pretty monotonous after a little bit. I would suggest this game if one plans on completing the entire Kingdom Hearts series, and not if one was only going to play this game."
5,This game is awesome!!!!,I recently purchased this game and frankly this game is AWESOME!!!!!!.The story is good the gameplay is great and the graphics are flawless.Some of the cutscenes are even like Ps2 graphics!!.the fighting system is card based but dont let that fool you because it is still very good.it I never thought square enix and disney could make a kingdomhearts for the GBA that is this good but it looks like they did.I think its safe to say that Square and disney have created another masterpiece.
4,only two little bumps..... but GREAT!!!,"first off i want to tell you im not a seroius gamer at all, i just like to follow storylines and keep my self occupied. it is almost a scintific break through that my parents even let me get a game boy. i dont have any system no, ps2, xbox, gamecube,playstation. soooo anyway...... back to the gba game,its great!! !! !! !! =)! theres only 2 tiney probloms first off theres ALOT of talking and secoundly only in the beginning thers a battle EVERY step you take it gets kindove annoying but it ends soon after that, your home free you've got the whole game ahed of you, its a GREAT GAME!!"
4,Kingdom hearts,Unfourtunately I have not gotten my hands on this game yet but I do love Kingdom hearts and since it's kingdom hearts it cant be that bad. Even though I havent played it I have done a lot of reserch on it and it is a good game other than the whole card thing. It is pretty important if you are going to be playing kingdom hearts 2 because this game comes between kh1 and 2 which are both great games. If you dont play it it wont be imposible to understand kh2 but it will help. If you like seeing good graphix and stuff this is a must have gba game. In fact it won the award for best gba graphics. so its a good game.
1,evil sisters,namine and nainme are the most evil sisters on the universes of all galaxies and clutter out there!!!! perferred the fan versionb but i hate nainme!!!
1,Come On,"On ""Bad Decision"", come on nobody can make a reivew like that. Your point is somewhat biased. You should atleast play the game. and know the game boy advance is not stupid, I have one and I am 16, but then again I hardly play it. This ""Kid's Review"" was written without an arguement and without facts to back up your poorly put together review. And beating the first game doesn't prove anything, besides this game leads into the next game. One last thing I have not played it either, but I will be buying it soon, so my review really is not a review, this just argues your point."
3,diadora,"This is a remake of kingdom hearts and i somehow don't like it. I much perfer the kh ps2 fan version with Nainme in it. But Nainme's younger sister Namine is in com so that perks the game up a bit!!!IN KH2: Final countdown, Nainme no longer in love with Riku and after a year without him Riku finds shes with someone else, so he asks namine, nainme;s sister to help be together again. But because of sora being the keyblade master,( whom was once controlled by Nainme) every action sora made threatened namines life because of the hearts problem in her family(Nainme originally had half a heart but was restored by mickeys keyblade) So namine asked Riku she would help bring back nainmes memories about Riku but only if Riku would protect the younger sister of the superstar. Apparantly so he agrees, but Nainme(the reviewer) has not yet given information about, kh2: Final countdown yet so who knows wheather Riku and Nainme will be one again till september?!"
2,OK GAME NOT VERY GOOD,"This game is O.K. One of the good things is that it picks up right where KH1 left of, on the road after they caught up with Pluto. One of the bad things is that you have to use a card system that totaly sucks. Plus there are no new worlds except for Twilight Town. there might be on or two more but i can't remember. this game is totaly about sora's memory. all you ever do is go to the worlds that he remembers. The ""Unknown"" Organization is about the only new thing in the entire game. At the end of the game you have to fight this hard guy from the Organization. After you beat the Sora part of the game you get to play as Riku. But the only cool thing about that is you can jump higher. the only thing that you do is go backwards through the worlds that you went through with sora. King Mickey is in the Riku Version though. The only reason I would recommend this game is because I think it links KH1 and KH2 together."
5,king of kingdom hearts,"I have beaten both kingdom hearts games and i love them both. I especially liked this one, because at the end you can play as rikku. If you love final fantasy and other rpg games then, this is for you."
3,It was a good game.,"If you are a fan of Kingdom Hearts, this game is great for you. However, the fighting system is not as good as Kingdom Hearts I and II and probably becomes boring after playing for hours."
3,BORING!!!,Its boring but if you want to know what happens before #2 then it will tell you and thats all I have to say about that
5,Ultima,"This game, while challenging, has a high playabilay level, I know this because my brother plays it over and over again. This game is also extremely usefull in filling in the gaps of the story line from Kingdom Hearts Two. If you have not played this game before playing Kingdom Heart Two you will be confused about what happened. I strongly reccomend this game to fans of the franchise."
2,Decent but not worth the money,"This 50's cd set reminds me of a Happy Days album I had as a child. It is ok, but in no way does it resemble a mob hit movie. I was disappointed. My 67 year old father loves it though"
3,A Man of Integrity,"My respect for Jimmy Carter drew me to this.The film surrounds the release of Carter's book and book tour on Palestine and the obstacles he met because of it. We get a sense of Jimmy's character and devotion to what he takes on and also his emotional tie to people, religion and our place in the scheme of things on earth.As a film, I was less impressed, especially with the shaky camera work in some places. I think there is a better documentary about Jimmy Carter to be made."
3,It's an okay purchase,"I was impressed with the delivery time as it was faster than the expected delivery date and was in time to give as a Christmas gift for my father-in-law. However, slightly disappointed that it comes in a slim cardboard-like case for what I paid for the DVD. I was hoping it was going to be a nice plastic dvd case like most dvds are supposed to come in. My father-in-law liked the dvd but was somewhat disappointed it wasn't in a nice case, too."
1,Make me laugh.,"The single worst United States President in modern times (if not ever) has a movie put out by well known leftist Demme and I'm supposed to jump in and buy it? Boy, I bet speaking in front of Brandeis was so daring! Please... the left preaching to the far left. I guess that's daring! Now do what you guys do best and trash all the conservative authors who you couldn't stomach to read just so they get a lower star rating. You know you do so go do it. Great country America!"
3,FOR PEOPLE IN THE KNOW,I did not know enough background to really appreciate this book. I have been going to movies for over 50 years and i am an artist with a BFA and an MFA and it was still a difficult book for me. The title said to me that he would discuss spatial things about the movies. But he talks about many things and not spatial things.
3,"Manny is likeable, but not really a good writer","A cult book. Not being in on the cult, let me say that Farber had pretty good taste in movies, liking hard-boiled masculine shoot-em-ups in the Forties. And he is, apparently, a very good painter, still having one man shows today in his late eighties. Still, he was a hideously disorganized writer. Reviews seem to start and end at random points in his chain of thoughts. There are some good phrases, but I'd be hard pressed to recount many coherent ideas from his book. It's not that he's lacking good ideas -- in fact, he has too many. He's just not very good at putting them into a comprehensible form. If you are a fanatic for either forties tough guy directors or late sixties artsy directors, you'll no doubt benefit from grinding through the book, but for the general reader, it's a struggle.I'm hardly surprised that he gave up reviewing over 25 years ago for painting. Writing just doesn't seem to be his strong suit."
2,It is not very good,"It is very basic, it doesn't give many examples of as improving your apartment through of the Feng Shui"
5,"Wonderful, warm, and funny novel...","I bought this book a week ago after seeing a woman reading it on the subway and laughing. I had been looking for a quick summer novel that I could read to and from work - and I found it! The problem was that I couldn't put it down when I got to work!I fell in love instantly with Maz who is lovable, warm, and a smart main character. Her adventures with her two adorable daughters, her crazy mother, and her try at love are hilarious. You can't help but get sucked into this wonderful story. Even after finishing it, the characters stuck in my head. Can't wait until the author writes another one!"
4,"Fast, enjoyable read about a quirky family","This is the story of Maz, who has 2 children in Connecticut, a husband in Santa Fe, and a fortune-telling mother who just married her sixth husband.I thought a couple of the reviews above were off. I didn't think the sex scenes were coarse, and I didn't think Maz was curmudgeonly. Maz is a likable woman whose life is a little out of control, but it's an exciting ride to read about.When Maz's unreliable husband and crazy mother descend on her house in Connecticut, that's when the fun begins.I don't want to give away too much about the plot, but if you like domestic fiction written by women, it's almost a sure bet that you'll enjoy this. It reminded me a bit of Anne Tyler, but slightly earthier and more dramatic."
4,Really enjoyable fun book,"I read the advance copy, but I assume it's about the same as the final edition. I really enjoyed the novel; it's witty, funny, touching, and the main character, Maz, is likeable and vulnerable. I generally don't read the genre, but am glad I made an exception, because the book was delightful and entertaining."
2,Exaggerated story line--and where's the humor?,"I'm surprised that so many reviewers found this book so hilarious--in fact, I got the book mainly based on the rave reviews!Now, I do appreciate dark comedy (for instance, I love Marian Keyes' novels, and I watch Desperate Housewives), but there simply wasn't much that was funny in this novel. Most of the characters were not very fleshed out (well, aside from the ones that really *were* supposed to seem one-dimensional, like Lenny and Madame Lucille). Perhaps my problem was that I failed to see the humor in situations that really were quite awful. Madame Lucille, for instance, *would* have been funny, if the things she did (and is still doing) to Maz weren't quite so terrible. To top that all off, as some other reviewers commented, the protagonist, Maz, just really isn't all that likeable."
1,"Not funny, not crazy, just weird","I can't see what people find funny about this book at all. A main character that is a complete ditz. Jerry Springer like story lines. A child whose dialogue is of an adult. If one wants to read it, I would save it for a beach read. However, I suggest picking a beach read that isn't full of the mindless drivel, unappealing characters, and bizarre, though not amusing, story lines that this book has."
3,Not as funy as described,I was looking forward to a good out loud laugh but did not get one with this book. The characters are very weird and if it wasn't for the ending I would have deemed the read a waste of time.
5,A pleasant surprise...,"I am not a huge fan of chick lit, but ""What Comes After Crazy"" is a delightful read. It was recommended to me by someone who knows I love Anne Tyler. While this isn't in that same caliber (it's much less literary) I can see why a comparison might be made. Both authors provide domestic novels full of colorful, ramshackle lives. Once I knew it was about a fortune teller's daughter with an estranged husband who is a religious con man, I knew it was up my alley.While I didn't love everything about it (I could have done without the overly ideal Dr. Dan), it is definitely a highlight of my reading so far this year. I look forward to the author's other books."
3,it passes the time,"I wouldn't really recommend this book for anyone who wants a good read. It is goofy and perhaps onlygood for bedtime reading. Not much to think about or not much to hope for in a good ending.Boring plot, no growth or progress in the storyline. Basically, a waste of time."
4,versatile,"These wiffle balls work well for many batting drills. They do tend to break after several hits, though. They are supposed to work with the Grand Slam batting machine but after 3 months and 3 different ball reservoirs they still haven't sent me the parts that will make the machine feed these balls without jamming. I have to hand-feed the stupid machine one at a time. Too late to send it back or I would. Now the company is ignoring my calls to get parts that work."
3,First published in 1983,"A modest-sized book with a diverse collection of exercises and visual illusions. Was first published in 1983 by the Theosophical Society of America. Good if you are interested in ""popular-level"" perceptual psychology. If you are interested in serious, detailed bodywork or emotional change,look somewhere else (e.g.,Feldenkrais method, or Michael Brown's The Presence Process)."
3,Good beginners guide to a complicated flight sim,"If you're new to flight sims and trying to tackle Janes' F-15, then you'll no doubt find this guide to be of great help. More experienced sim-pilots will enjoy the detailed graphs and weapons overviews, but much of the rest of the guide will be of little value for them. Much of the info in the guide is already available in the Expert Manual that came with the simulator. There is good information here for any player of Janes' F-15, but the focus is definately on the less experienced sim pilot."
1,The item doesn't match it's description,"""One 300W/120V halogen J type bulb for torchiere"" - NOT TRUE. Only 180W for torchiere.Extremely bad service, they didn't return e-mails (twice)."
1,No English subtitles,"I bought Bless the Woman but have no idea if the movie is any good because there are no English subtitles. The movie claims to have English subtitles, but they aren't there, so unless one understands Russian, it is impossible to watch the movie."
4,"Very good single, solid nickelback track","Again, the song savin' me proves why Nickelback are a multiplatinum band that hasn't faded away like other bands from their time (staind, limp biscut, ect...). This track is poppy enough to play on ""alternatvie"" stations, yet rock enough to play on hard rock stations. The Album ""All The Right Reasons"" shows no signs of nickelback fading into the sunset yet.The other tracks on this CD include a live version of ""Animals"", Live version of ""Follow You Home"", and the video for ""Savin ME"", along with the radio mix of ""Savin ME"". Nice to pick up and add to the collection, plus a place to see the video anytime you want, pretty cool concept again. Worth a spin, pick this up."
5,Good corner protection,I kept bumping my head on the corner of a glass shelf in our bathroom. This has solved the issue!
1,Shocked by other good reviews...,"I am so disappointed. After reading a few good reviews, I was so excited to have this for my stationery business. It damages more paper than it can cut clean. I have wasted so much money on this machine (it is being sent back). And time, from having to reprint everything. Unfortunately, the paper slides around, and if you have the crank too tight, it curls the paper at the base of the holder which causes damage. It did cut clean, just not straight or without damage. For my purposes, the paper I cut cannot be damaged, so this cutter was not good for me."
5,Martin Yale Commercial Cutter,"Martin Yale Commercial Cutter is a great cutter and does what it says it will done. I like that you can set the cutting guide in both inches and centimeters, and it is very accurate on the cuts."
4,cute,"This is a poem book featuring a cat named Toots. Toots is a stray. A nice family finds him and gives him a home. He enjoys a nice life with them. He does all the things a cat loves: eats, sleeps and plays! These poems are all about Toots and his exciting life!What did you like or not like about the book?We loved the illustrations. They really captured the feeling of how playful Toots is.Would you recommend this book? Why or Why not?Yes. This would be a great short read for cat lovers of all ages."
4,A great look at the Vanderbilt residences,This book is a great look at the stories of all the houses the Vanderbilts purchased or created with their spetacular wealth- and also some of the fascinating stories of the eccentric family members behind the houses. The book is filled with rare photographs and stories of all the Vanderbilt castles.I found the book to be very entertaining- a must have if you're interested in the Vanderbilt family or the Gilded Age in general.
2,Color?,In the discription it said the movies were color. Only one of five were color. Still good old John Wayne movies.
2,The John Wayne Film collection,I bought this for my husband and I do not like it - it is all black and white and very old and out-dated.
5,"Good films, great price","Three very good films -- Allegheny Uprising, Without Reservations, and Reunion in France -- and three enjoyable ones for less than $3 a film? Hard to pass up. Reunion in France is probably the best -- and not at all typical for a Wayne film, but then he's a supporting character."
4,Diverse collection,"This is a welcome release from WB, 6 very different films. The quality overall is good, although I do not think any of the films have been fully restored they are all reasonable prints. All discs have a period related extra and some have trailers. I would have liked to have seen the colorized version of Allegheny Uprising included as a bonus. The box set discs are identical to the individual releases at a good saving in price."
5,JOHN WAYNE!!,John Wayne movie.... need I say more? I guess I do since it won't let me submit with such few words. hahahaha
5,great toy,Great toy that does not get boring for a longest time. I would buy it again and would buy for gifts as well.
3,JUST RELEASE THE COMPLETE SEASONS ALREADY,"This dvd is obviously just a bone thrown to us to chew on until the next season is released. I'll chew on it but I would like to see a shorter release time from season to season.While I understand it takes longer due to the commentary recording, I really would rather have the episodes themselves. The commentaries are seldom interesting anymore and border on annoying. I think they would be better if the cast contributed more comments. Rather then just a silent Groening, Al Jean, and other assorted writers/directors. I really enjoyed the commentary with Hank Azaria on the most recent set.Simply put, I would rather just have the episodes themselves without the commentaries if I could get them quicker. As opposed to waiting another year just to hear Al Jean talk about what somebody brought to lunch one day while they were having a writers meeting."
2,Gone Wild?,"At the very least they could've included the episode where the Simpsons went to FL for Spring Break and ended up running from the law after killing/knocking out the alligator, ended up working in the South at a diner.There are any number of Simpson Vacation episodes to choose from that could've been included on this dvd. Had they asked for my input, I would've done it for free.This does not tide me over till season 5's release. Friends/Buffy/X-Files/Sex and the City/South Park dvd release schedule beats the pants off the Simpsons dvd release schedule."
2,Pass On This and Get The Full Season Instead,"I think I am in league with several other reviewers (but it's hard to tell for sure with some of the ALL CAP rants, and awful spelling!) I love The Simpsons, and so far I own all four of the season box sets, with season 5 pre-ordered. Someone gave me ""Gone Wild"" for a present, and always willing to watch The Simpsons I popped it in. The DVD starts off with an episode already available on Season 1? I don't understand why they would include something that has already been released onto another dvd? The other 4 episodes found on this collection are not available in the season box sets...yet, but to be honest, I would much rather wait and get the entire season complete than purchase one show on this disk, another show on another disk etc. Only if you are a die-hard fan of the show and cannot wait for Fox to slowly dole out the remaining seasons would I recommend this dvd."
1,RIP-OFF!!!!!,"So this just comes out and already we are lined up for another Christmas collection in the next few weeks.Here's an idea...how about just releasing SEASON FIVE!!!!I'm going to be middle-aged by the time the seasons are all released.Absolutely NO EXCUSE seeing as how other shows like Star Trek, Buffy, Angel, etc. release their season sets every 4-6 months. Yet we have to wait YEARS for Simpsons. What is even more of a slap to the face is the relatively fast release of Futurama!! Who exactly is the dingleberry in charge of these release schedules.RIP-OFF!!!!!!!!"
4,I have this DVD!!!,"IN great britain the dvd has already been released, its an ok disc, apart from the first season episode 'Homer's Night Out' which lets be honest nobody wants to watch, and the featurette is about Krusty The Klown which is really pointless.However 'Sunday Cruddy Sunday' 'Mansion Family' and 'Homer The Moe' are Brilliant episodes and are favourties of mine. bu I do agree with most of the simpsons fans HURRY UP WITH THE SEASON DVD'S, by the he time they have finished the simpsons season dvd's there'll be a new format to play on!!!!"
1,Not going to buy it.,"Homer's Night Out - Mar-1990The Mansion Family - Jan-2000Sunday, Cruddy Sunday - Jan-1999Homer the Moe - Nov-2001Come On. If you can release an episode from 2001 release them all. You can sell the dvds with the commentaries later as a special edition.Hey! you can sell the seasons twice that way!Why play around with a $10 flop."
1,Typical Monster Cable rip off,"Despite all the bad reviews I read for various Monster Cable products, I bought one of these cables. What a mistake. The RCA plug flanges kept working loose shortly after purchase. The first time I tried to gently squeeze them back together, one broke, only to reveal the cheap metal used in the connector. Now it's loose all the time. So I'm replacing it with a Belkin AV20500-15 cable, available right here at Amazon for about 1/4 the price of Monster. Thankfully I chose other brands for all my other home theater cables (digital coax, optical, speaker) . Avoid all Monster Cables. All overpriced, all mediocre quality. Do your research, you'll see I'm not alone."
1,what a total MARKETING RIP-OFF!!!,"Bought a no-name subwoofer cable off eBay, took it over to my friend's house. He owns this Monster cable; we switched back and forth between the no-name ($6 shipped) and this one, and guess how much of a difference the Monster cable made?ZIP. ZERO. NADA. Thhhhhhpt!God bless eBay, and God help all the suckers who buy all the Monster Cable advertising hype."
2,NOT VERY HAPPY,"I thought having a nice denon receiver and just bought a new mirage sub,there top of the line prestege s-10 I'd up-grade the sub cable to. Unfortunately it made no differance at all, just the same as what I was using before. I realy don't know how the other people who gave it five stars could of realy heard any improvement with this? Like I said I'm using a very good sub, my son has a review of it here on amazon for anyone looking for a very good sub. If there's anything good to say, I got this cable cheap so not a major loss atleast!"
2,not my slice of pecan pie..,This candle is ok if you like a cinnamon aroma.. but doesn't smell like pecan pie at all to me.. it did burn clean and thorough but just not the smell i was hoping for..
2,Be careful using the advice in this book,I have had mixed results with Frommer's books. I like their maps and guides to attractions... BUT... The hotels they recommend in the lower end category often fall short. I especially did not like their recommendations for Rome.The book has a great layout but the hotels need to be rechecked. I would make sure to balance this book with another guide like Karen Brown's or Fodor's... I make sure any hotel I stay in has a good rating in at least two sources....
1,This sucked,"It just sucked.The real name is Leslie: My Name is Evil not Manson: My Name is Evil. What a sham. I never would have watched this garbage if I knew it was about her and not him. Just capitalizing on the Manson name. Horrible scenes, bad acting, poor plot... the music was okay."
3,Manson revisited,It was a pretty ok movie but lacked a lot in the acting department as far as the cast went.We ALL know the story though!It is worth a look at!
3,BLAND BUT IT HAD ITS MOMENTS,"WEll, HALF WAY THROUGH i WAS LIKE "" f****** CORNY "", BUT THAT WAS UNTIL THE STABBING SCENE. TRUE IT COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER, BUT IT IMPRESSED ME FOR SOME REASON. THE PART WHERE LESLIE WALKS INTO THE RANCH AND CHARLIE IS ON THE CROSS WAS MEMORABLE. HOWEVER THIS GUY PLAYED A MEDIOCRE MANSON. I RECOMMEND RENTING THIS AT THE MOST."
5,Green Jade Pendant,"Although it was smaller then I assumed, it is absolutely beautiful and arrived pretty quickly, nicely packaged and a great value"
3,"good Jansch, but not notable","I'm a little surprised that this title has been re-issued as a CD when there are other better and more interesting titles by Jansch out there that have not received such treatment (namely, ""Avocet,"" ""L. A. Turnaround,"" and ""Moonshine""). Anyway, this album has Bert playing in a small combo setting in a vaguely bluesy-country music-ish atmosphere. Importantly, none of the material is particulary riveting in any sense--lyrically, musically, or instrumentally (this is *not* a CD to seek out if you are an acoustic guitar maven). Still, neither is it an outright dud in any sense, and if you are a real Jansch fan or a listener who enjoys hearing some true professionals making some good, unpretentious sounds together, you'll like it.--(...)"
2,Christmas charms with suction cups,I gave the charms as a gift and was told that two of the charms already lost their suction. I'm disappointed with this product and would not recommend it. They are very cute but if they can't stick what's the point of having them.
5,"looks like leather, performes like nylon","I have gone to all Accumould Elite duty gear with the exception of my holster (it's a Blackhawk SERPA). These products cost less than leather but can be cleaned and sanitized like nylon. If they are scratched the material underneath is also black, unlike leather gear. As a bonus they weigh less, I saved a couple of pounds off my duty rig!"
2,Darth Vader Transformer,"Typical plastic toy that cost far too much, but it's what my son wanted. My son, who is 5 1/2 years old found this transformer far too difficult to put together. Also, it wasn't made well enough to withstand playtime, now many of the pieces that broke off are lost. Not a good toy for a younger child."
4,"A simple, useful book","The book provides the most detailed description of the islands I have seen. It provides a good balance between geological, historical and practical information that will appeal both to the occasional visitor and the fan of Boston and New England history. The writing style is simple and friendly. The only critic would be that the book is ageing and an update taking into account the most recent travel and National Park Service information would be welcome."
5,Another Excellent Release,"I'd just gotten the first Jango release, Dreamtown, about four weeks ago and it hasn't really left my CD player since. Jango is an LA band of obviously highly talented musicians with heavy nods towards Steely Dan (both lyrically and stylistically) and Toto (check out ""Message to Ramona"" from the first CD). The new CD, Closer To Home, is (thankfully) more of the same. It includes two tracks, ""Soul Casserole"" and ""Nightside Express"" which display a funkier side of the band that wasn't that evident on the first release, very tasty. This is the type of music that can serve both as a ""background"" to a fine meal and Merlot, or turn the lights down and listen to directly. It's also beautifully recorded, and I predict it'll be a ""demo"" CD for high-end audio salons. Highly Recommended!"
4,"ONE OF A FEW , A CLASSIC TO BE.","The first thought I had when listening for the first time to ""So Far Away"" was a very different song by the Beatles...but , in a way, I feel both of them to be similar in a way: the oldest one IS A CLASSIC - this new song by ""Social Distortion"" has it all to BECOME A CLASSIC. The orchestation and the singing are very well defined. The rythm is the best. It allows for ""letting it sink"" in your mind, without being disturbing. It gives you the choice, either to listen to it carefully, with concentration; or you can let it impregnate you in a very creative mood; or you can just DANCE IT. Like so many other things in our life, the similarities are greater than the differences, these being felt mostly in the intensivity and strength of the musical ""message"". I think this CD can have a public of listeners from both generations: middle-aged folks and their youngsters. Finally: No generation gap in this CD...It is UNIVERSAL."
5,Best CD Ever for hardcore punks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This was a great album!I have always loved Mike Ness,and his lyrics are awesome!!! My favorite songs are:Ball and chain,story of my life,drug train,and sick boys!I also love:The Misfits,ramones,clash,and the buzzcocks!Buy these albums!!!"
5,One Awesome Album!!!,"I've loved this album for years, and I highly recommend it to any who like good, hard hitting music. Also has a great remake of Johnny Cash's ""Ring of Fire"", (this is NOT your parents Johnny Cash)."
4,Strong album!,"Punk...with musicianship? Strange combination, but one that I like. Front to back, Social Distortion is a strong offering, chock full of attitude (the songs just sound like they're sneering at you with contempt). It also has a bit of a rockabilly flair to it that adds another dimension to the band's sound and gives the album some variety. Good stuff!"
4,Fourteen years later and still going strong...,"I remember when I was a freshman in college, watching the now-defunct 120 Minutes on MTV, I came across the videos for both ""Ball And Chain"" and ""Story Of My Life"". At the time, neither video made an impression on me...Well, fourteen years later, I came across SD's self-titled CD at the library and decided to borrow it. All I can say is that rockabilly and punk never sounded so good together! The CD is so good I went out and bought a copy of my own! In addition to that, Mike Ness' tales of hard luck and the downtrodden make it even all the more appealing. I especially like their cover of Johnny Cash's ""Ring Of Fire"". Pretty darn good if you think about it. :)In any case, this is a CD that I'll be playing for years to come!"
5,Why other countries wish they were us...,"Can anyone doubt Mike Ness's power and feeling when he gets a Mic in front of him? Just a small clip from any of his songs is enough to get you hooked on Social D for life. Honestly, who out there can listen to a track like ""Ring of Fire"" and not start playing air guitar or drums? Long live the Gods of punk.""I fell in to a burnin ring of fire... I went down, down, down... But the flames went higher..."""
5,top favorite album,"This is a really good album and one of my top favorite social distortion albums ever, highly recommend it to anyone who wants to listen to social distortion."
3,Social Distortion sounding a bit like a college rock band,"First of all I'd like to mention that this review is biased since I'm a fan of the slightly more raw sounding Social Distortion. Social Distortion has put out some awesome Rock N' Roll but a lot of this album sounds a bit like washed down college rock to me. Very slick production & a bit too poppy here & there. HOWEVER, there are still some damn good songs on here, a cover of Ring Of Fire, & the classics Ball & Chain, So Far Away & Drug Train make this album good. The best songs are the well-honed bluesy-Social-Distortion-brand-rock while some of the rest sound a bit whiny. I definitely recommend Mommy's Little Monster over this or even Mainliner if you wanna hear some early punk rock Social D. (I'd actually give this 3.5 stars since I like basically half the album)."
3,A Johnny Cash Cover!,"Worth getting just for Ball and Chain and the Johnny cash cover, Ring of Fire. Fun."
3,Fast and loud,"It's always nice to hear a rock band that is prepared to raise a sweat and pack some punch rather than strive for some slick, mass-appeal and over-produced sound.There is nothing refined about their sound. They play fast and loud behind Mike Ness's gruff and gravelly vocals.The album begins well with the basic melancholy rocker ""So far Away"" followed by the exuberantly hurried ""Let It Be Me"" and what could only be Ness's autobiographical ""Story Of My Life"". The best track, the bluesy ""It Coulda Been Me,"" owes something to Dr Feelgood."
2,Not very cool,"This cd was a let down. I go to the record store. I'm looking for some good punk rock. ""Social D"" I think to myself, ""They're awesome punk rock, right? 'White Light, White Heat, White Trash' was the coolest cd ever, so this must be cool, right?"" Wrong. Not to speak badly of Mikey Ness, or anything, but this album was far too slow. It had too much of a focus on Mike's voice and not enough on the music itself. But that's my opinion, I notice that other people gave it five stars. That's cool, I guess. I just don't agree."
4,Sick boy,"Ok, as much as I love Social D, Sick boy made me exactly that. Sick. I've always been a Social D fan, so dont think I'm doing this cuz I dont appreciate them. if you want to hear the original (and in my opinion, the much much better) version of this song, get the MxPx album ""Let it Happen."" Social D just somehow made that song boring. Otherwise, I love them. Go out and buy it."
1,THE WORST ALBUM I HAVE EVER HEARD.,"There is a fate worse than death and it is this album. I can't believe that anybody listened to this piece of crap at the record company and said ""YEAH! we got somethin' here! Let's us give these boys a record contract!"". All of the songs, or should I say ""the song"" because they are all the same song, are boring, repetitive, corny, lazy, trying to be neo-white trash, fake-punk and most of all terrible. Don't get me wrong. I'm as punky as the next guy but this band makes other ""we only know three chords"" bands like the Ramones look like Jimi Hendrix. I can't believe I wasted this much of my life writing about this ""band"". I guess I just wanted to warn all you people out there that there is a new terror among us and it is Social Distortion. Beware."
3,"Good Subject, Horrible delivery","This is a good story about how the sex industry can tear a woman apart, and how past sexual abuses can influence ones acceptance of the sex trade. HOWEVER it is horrible delivered. The whole book could have been just one chapter of Juliet's story. It was so redundant. She kept repeating the same thing, her stepfather wanted her body, she doesn't want to marry Patrick, she was molested, okay we get this but she will tell the exact same peice of story in one chapter, and repeat it verbatim in the next chapter. IT got to the point when it seemed as if she were just whining about her situation.I purchased the book from Barnes and Nobles last night, Im on page 73 and I keep putting the book down and trying to pick it up and go on. But, its just not interesting.I will return the book today and pick up something else."
3,"Not the zing of ""Highwire"" theme or the ""The Saint""","Checked out this Edwin Astley album because of his theme song for the TV show ""Dangerman"". The theme itself is named ""Highwire"", a really outstanding TV theme song. My review here is based only on the samples found on the iTunes Store and quite frankly the purpose of this review is just to point you there so you can have a listen. In any case, my guess is that this CD will mostly be of interest to fans of the TV show it covers."
1,International Detective,The Cd is a ugly edition and it comes with its booklet all wrinkled and it is not the edition that Amazon shows in its website.
2,Very Disappointing,"Alas, this CD has the music from the movie played competently by a woman named Gertie Huber with snippets of dialogue tossed in. Don't be deceived by the packaging! If you're looking for the original dialogue and soundtrack--get the movie on DVD from Criterion. If it's the original music you're after, as I was, make certain you buy a CD with the music played by the original artist: Anton Karas on the Zither. Bottom line: perfectly pleasant. But I learned my lesson--read more carefully before I order!"
2,Caveat Emptor,"This is not ab original soundtrack from, yes, one of the very greatest films. It's a weak, metallic, even off key botching up of one of the arguably greatest soundtracks in film history. Rather search for ""The best of Anton Karas"". But sadly even on that collection - the final 'Anna Walks Away Past Rat Skunk Martins' (as you can tell I actually prefer Harry Lime to little snitch writer of potboiler westerns!) - is not included."
3,Good attempt at Portraying the Scene,"Think maybe the previous reviewer missed some of the focus of the book. It was about a lifestyle , and not just the music , and for that is a fairly good read. Having said that , I'm a bit biased as I come from the Blackpool Area"
2,This could have been so much better,"Eagerly awaited as the first book to focus on the UK's Northern Soul scene, this is a real disappointment. The book hardly features the music at all preferring to concentrate on the author's addiction to amphetamines. For an insider to the scene, the book is worthless. For an outsider it gives a totally false impression. Not everyone went to Wigan Casino for the drugs, some of us actually liked (and still do) Soul music.And yes, you will find I contributed to the book, about three pages all told starting at page 101, but that was before I had read the rest of the book !"
5,Just what I needed,I needed to keep some photos and related information in one book and this binder really fit my needs. It was an excellent choice for me.
3,Fight Fire With Fire,"This Tribute is exactly what one would expect from a tribute album. A few good songs, a few poor ones, with the rest being merely interesting. While a couple of the artists sound like they are trying to imitate The Talking Heads, most do a fair job of bringing something original to the tribute. The most original being ""Buning Down the House"" by Gee. I was very suprised that my favorite Talking Heads Song would also be my favorite one on a tribute album. It was obviously made to be a value buy since the CD cover has nothing but a front and a back... no inside cover. Overall, A good CD if you like the songs of Talking Heads, but if you are a die hard fan, you may think that your gods have been blasphemed."
5,Every American should watch this!,"I think every American should be aware of all the information contained in this documentary. Kudos to the director, it is a very easy-to-watch video, even for people like myself who know very little about the workings of our U.S. Government's fiscal policies, as well as its involvement in the economy of our nation. This movie has been a call to action for me, and I hope it will be for anyone else too. I have purchased several copies of this film and given them out to friends and family, and I would recommend to anyone."
1,Can the information in this film be trusted?,"How can we trust a documentary from Peter G. Peterson?Council on Foreign RelationsSenior Chairman and Co-Founder, The Blackstone GroupFormer chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of New YorkFormer chairman and chief executive officer of Lehman BrothersCo-leaseholder with Larry Silverstein of the World Trade Center when they were demolished on 9/11This guy is one of the corporatist insiders responsible for the mess we are in."
2,A good subject but poorly made film,"I am familiar with the subject matter of this film, so I was looking for the topic being expressed in a more interesting and impressive way in the movie. But speaking purely from a film making point of view, this is a very poorly made documentary."
2,Disappointing,"This film was entirely too technical. Not having a good understanding of economics and economic policy, I was completely lost. The subject matter is important, but the filmmakers lost an opportunity to appeal to the masses with this movie."
5,Great Story,"This is a slightly darker episode in the series. Tintin spends a bit of time on the docks and as a stow away on a ship. It is still a great mystery, and I love this episode a lot.Some of this episode was blended into the 2011 film, The Adventures of Tintin. This isn't the main story line - the Unicorn and Red Rackham are the bulk of the movie.I loved watching this on HBO in the early 90's with my son when he was young. We still love watching this today and are always surprised by who did it and the great mystery of these stories.The animation is simple. The story tries very hard to follow the books closely. The same color pallet and figures are used in these cartoons as the books. The voice over isn't always great, but the stories are so good, no matter.The DVD Box set:The Adventures of Tintin, Vols. 1-5The Adventures of Tintin, Vols. 6-10The 2011 film:The Adventures of TintinThe new DVD releases:The Adventures Of Tintin: Season OneThe Adventures Of Tintin: Season Two"
4,NICE PRODUCT,"i BOUGHT SEASON 1 AND 2, BOTH COME IN A NICE PRESENTATION, THE VIDEO QUALITY IS GOOD AND BOTH INCLUDE ENGLISH AND SPANISH AUDIO. FUTURE BUYERS MUST TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THAT THE SPANISH AUDIO IS THE LATIN aMERICAN VERSION.FOR TINTIN FANS THESE ARE A MUST HAVE ITEMS.BYE AND I WISH YON CAN ENJOY TINTIN AND SNOWY (MILOU PARA LATINOAMERICA) ADVENTURES."
3,The adventures of TINTIN: season one.,"The Tintin books, which were successful in their time are now dated and crudely written compared to other literature of the same genre. Even the comic books written today are smoother in their flow and more subtle in their plot devices; however, it is an interesting read for a teenager who might like to see how comic books originated."
4,The Adventures Of Tintin: Season One,"one of the nostalgic series of my life. See Tintin and Snowy again, is wonderfull , is like come back to my childhood"
4,True to the books,"I love the Tintin books and this animated DVD is true to the books; same animation and story lines. Unfortunately the voice acting is fairly stiff and unnatural especially the voice of Tintin. The one exception is the voice over of the dog Snowy which is great. I love the books, but one odd thing is the lack of female characters. The only major female character is the Opera singer Bianca Castafiore. Other than that, only very few females appear briefly in minor roles in the books. I think the books could have been way more fun with more girls and women. In fact the book ""The Castafiore Emerald"" with Signora Bianca Castafiore as the main character is my favorite Tintin book, because it's the funniest."
4,"Incredible songs, below average quality","This four-disc compilation represents some of the greatest Benny Goodman tracks ever recorded. There is little new here to Goodman's die hard fans, but for anyone new to the Big Band era, this is an excellent introduction. The one caveat is the sound quality. There is no excuse that these brilliant songs have to be compromised by numerous glitches, scratches and static. I have all of these songs on other CD's and the quality on those discs is superior.A strong element of this collection is that all styles of Benny's music are represented: patented swing numbers mixed in with slower tempo ballads and some ballads. Listen particularly to Peggy Lee's brilliant 'Why Don't You Do Right,"" and the sexy spin she puts on the song.If you are serious about Goodman you can do better than this collection with the sub-standard audio, but if you don't mind some bumps and scratches, this is the compilation for you."
5,this is hot,I love all the songs are good to me. Birdman is nice and his flow is great with lil wayne on 3 of his songs.
1,"this is not the ""carter""",This album is a big disappointment. I'm not really into down south music but Lil Wayne's the Carter stays playing in my car. This my friend is not even close to the Carter. The beats all sound the same and without a good beat Baby is just not worth listening to. Just wait for the Carter II to drop.
3,Birdman needs help,"Birdman first album had good rappers on it beside him , this one doesn't its not good as the first one. There is Birdman ,lil wayne and mannie fresh , He needs one more big star to make the album better.but birdman's second album is out. he has good tracks like get your shyne, Neck of the Woods, and Big Pimpin'. I give it 3 out of 5. Word of advice better rating, get bigger star on the album .like lud"
3,its aight,i thought the baby cd was aight. it aint like that mannie fresh cd but its worth buyin if u a cash money head like me
1,Baby a.k.a. Birdman; No matter how you say it; it still equals Bad Music,"This has to be one of the worst cd's I've ever listened to. It's a shame that I had to put down 10 bucks to pick this up. It's not even worth downloading. Man, has Cash Money went downhill. Their ship has sunk. Baby's lyrics are so pitiful... Lil' Wayne can rap, but ever since he started to try to freestyle all his raps, he's sounded like garbage...And now apparently, Mannie Fresh has left Cash Money... good thing too if it's true. He's the only one in the whole camp that has any talent... true, he can't rhyme to save his life... but when it comes to production, Mannie's always good. He needs to get away from Cash Money and actually produce for artists worthy of his beats.Another flop for Cash Money"
3,This is an ok album,"This album isn't great or groundbreaking but it's still decent. Baby's first CD was horrible but this one is a big improovement. Needless to say it's still not as good as Wayne, Turk, Juve, B.G or the Hot Boy's albums. I suggest getting Tha Carter 2 instead of this. If you already have that album than go get this if your a die hard Cash Money fan. The production on here is great and the lyrics are ok."
1,birdman drags the south down to a whole new level,"southern rappers were starting to make a name for themselves, after excellent albums from the likes of scarface, ludacris, outkast and young buck. but then the emergence of rappers that all sounded the same (TI, big mike, david banner, to name but a few) made south rap the new scapegoat of why hiphop wasnt producing many classics any more. birdman is a shining example of this - the beats on this album are unimaginative and samey, the lyrics are pretty subpar, and whoever said that this could be classified under gangsta rap needs their ears testing.to sum this up, i gave bizarre's new album hannicap circus a star more than this."
5,"Fun, intelligent blues","Somebody wrote on some liner notes about J.B. Hutto's ""declamatory"" style of singing. ""Declamatory"" is the least of it. I don't know any blues singer who had as much humor and wit, both in his lyrics and in his delivery. In this wonderful recording, listen to the delightfully saucy invitation of ""Pretty Baby,"" the wry humor and vivid images of ""Jealous Hearted Woman,"" the sly wit of ""Little Girl Dressed in Blue"" and broad humor of ""Radar."" It is interesting to compare this set of tracks with the much earlier ""Masters of Modern Blues"" disk, which is also good."
4,RAW SLIDE GUITAR,"I WAS SURPRISED HOW GOOD HE REALLY IS. Just great chicago style slide, makes me want to here more of him.....neat hat."
5,great stuff,My husband has stick straight hair. And there's a lot of it. This stuff really works for keeping it in place. Nothing else he has ever tried has worked this well. Love the size of this product. It will last longer than the 150 ml bottles he has been buying.
5,The best!,"This is probably one of the best styling gel I've ever used compared to other popular products like LA Bella, AXE, or Got2B Glued. It works like a charm. It is very strong and will hold your hair in place. You don't even have to use that much and it will hold your hair in place ALL DAY and without flakes. This gel gives you that natural subtle look instead of making your hair look all wet. It is also inexpensive, I bought a 5.1 oz for 8 bucks, it lasted me about 5 months and I use it almost everyday. I decided to get the 16.9 oz because I'll probably be using this product for a while."
5,Best hair product,Spiker is the best styling product I have used. It remains intact until you wash it out. Wouldn't use anything else.
4,great hair product,I buy this product for my son and it works really well for him. keeps his hair stiff like he likes it and no flakes.
3,Messy,"Just arrived, while in shrink wrap, it had leaked and was very messy when i opened it! Good product, but dissappointed it arrived the way it did."
3,Not a good bottle,"I love this hair product (I've reviewed the other bottle on Amazon with 5 stars -- it's amazing). However, this is not really good for an individual to use, because the product gets hardened up in the squirt portion, so that there is a big chunk of congealed product that comes out when you squirt it. It ends up wasting a lot...... Stick with the smaller bottle."
2,Dangerous Heat Build-Up,I purchased this product with the intent of using it to replace an old slow cooker I have had since the 1970's due to safety concerns with the old one. I used it today for the first time (cooking a roast on low heat) and noticed that the sides are very very hot...this afer only one hour of cooking so far. I would feel extermely nervous to leave the house for any length of time while this unit is cooking. I may try to return it to the store this week and find a different brand.
5,You,This was my first time shopping with amazon and won't be the last! I love this product. Quality and speed of delivery. And can I just say thank god they finally real eased it on to DVD!!!
2,Meh,I was bored for most of the film. I didn't come away with any profound insights or anything. Could've been condensed into a half hour to avoid it feeling so drawn out.
4,Good and light-handed Herzog doc,"This documentary is part Herzog social comment and part Errol Morris investigation. Told as part 'Thin Blue Line' style crime scene remembrance, and part interviews, Herzog seems to me to be very light-handed in his approach vs. his other efforts. I have to admit that I could also listen to Herzog read the phone book with his awesome accent. A good documentary, surprised that it did not get more push in it's release year."
3,Talk about depressing,"OK, a good documentary about the death penalty. Put me in a very dark place. How could someone commit a crime like this is such a mystery to me. Especially for no real reason, at least not one worth killing someone over. The film starts with an interview with an interview of a clergyman, a really good, good man, whose job it is to comfort the condemned at time of execution. That interview was worth the best part of the film. I really think that a sentence of life without parole is a moral sentence, but I'm not so sure about the death penalty, it seems to degrade everyone who took part in it, even though the condemned certainly deserved it."
5,Very impressive. Makes one THINK,"Everyone makes mistakes. However, the reasons for many homicides are just awful and pointless. Regardless of what you think is right or wrong regarding capital punishment, watching this documentary makes one consider his own life and how he should treat others, as well as how he should relate to others.I rarely speak to my own father, because he ruined our family with his infidelity and his marrying the ""other woman"" involved (who was also a neighbor/family friend). I have never forgiven him for this. What does this have to do with killing someone over a shiny red car? I'm not sure.Should I just let it go, and act like nothing ever happened? Or should HE be the one to make an apology about wrecking our family?This is a good documentary. Watch it. And let teens watch it as well. Maybe, JUST MAYBE, they will 2nd-guess their actions of stupidity."
5,great bio,This is a compelling movie and has made me re-think my position on the subject matter. The service was prompt and the condition of the product was excellent.
2,Very disappointed,"After being so highly acclaimed I thought this movie would envoke some real emotion. To the contrary I was bored throughout, waiting for a gripping point and it never came. I felt the producer who interviews the death row inmate really failed to engage the audience in the story, his lines of questioning really lacked much depth. I was totally shocked that he received such high acclaim for this piece."
3,Good....but not his best,"Recently I have had to review most of Herzog's documentaries for a thesis project. Although ""Abyss"" is considered one of his best, I believe there are other works that more closely reveal the heart of the filmmaker."
2,Should be much shorter,"The morality of executions has been debated for over 2,500 years probably longer. This is another one of those.What it is a real-life story of a prisoner about to be executed. It has been done so many times, I question do we need another one?In this case, we have a man who killed a person for a car. This film examines the people who knew the victim, the people associated with the murderer about to be executed and a little on the state people that are going to kill him. I did not find anything, particularly deep or original. Some are interesting.The man about to be killed looks like a nice guy. He thinks after execution that he is going to go to heaven, which I thought was interesting. Overall I think much could be cut out with no loss to the viewer."
1,Portrait of Evil,"The evil portrayed here isn't the evil of the murderers, but rather the evil of the director. Those who think that this movie is primarily about the death penalty are missing the point. I oppose the death penalty. The movie is primarily about liberal (leftist) sympathy with evil. The murderers in the movie are simply evil, and one is obviously a manipulative sociopath. Everything that liberals do is in support of evil, and particularly in support of the evolutionary success of evil over decency. This is made so clear in this move as the director does everything in his power to evoke sympathy for evil men. And in the end he celebrates the reproductive success of one of the murderers who found a wife while in prison. In modern liberal society, women love murders while decent men can't get a date. This is the result of liberal celebration of evil as exemplified by this film."
4,Honest Enough,"Herzog condemns the death penalty but never preaches. Both inmates absurdly claim neither committing nor seeing the murders, but admit joy riding in the stolen vehicles and running from police. It spends slightly too much time on the personalities and not enough on facts."
5,Soberly Real,"Herzog does it again in this sobering, thought provoking documentary on the aftermath of a 2001 triple homicide in Conroe, TX. Making viewers question capital punishment and its role as portrayed in Into the Abyss."
4,finally - the book that needed to be written,"First of all, I love the format of thisbook - each of the 43 lighthouses has afull-page color photo, facing the text,which is mostly quite informative. Alsothe smaller size of the book makes it verysuitable as a gift to any lighthouseaficionado. Anybody interested in theearly history of Canada would enjoygetting/reading this as much as I have.While I'd like to give it 5 stars, Ifound in some cases the photos wereoverly artistic or at least, not trulya detailed portrait of what I wanted to see.One such example is the lighthouse atBassin from 1871, described as ""most beautiful""and ""unusual"" in the text. The very colorfulphoto is mostly of the cliff, with a boat inthe foreground, and the very distant lighthousein the diagonal opposite corner. Composition-wise, it's no doubt a postcard-worthy image ..."
4,Funny stuff,"The Venuture Bros. is a short but funny series. The DVD boxset didnt have a ton of extra content, but the hilarity makes up for that, so if you're a fan ""humuorus violence"" then definately check this out."
5,Just Excellant,"Another great show from Adult Swim. If you are even a slight fan of Venture Brothers you should buy this dvd, or even if you are a fan of the other Adult Swim shows.I started watching Venture Brothers later in season 1 so I was used to the more evolved and developed art and voices, and you can tell this is the first season (but that is to be expected with any tv show, especially animation) Other than that the dvd and show is great.If anyone hopped on board this awesome tv show train, this dvd is definitely recommended as story elements were introduced early on that played out later in the season and in season 2."
5,great show!,"this show is amazing, and it's first season is a great watch. Very entertaining with it's own unique sense of humor. this isn't the kind of show that's hard to relate to, it's all about failure, and everyone at some point in their life has failed. if you enjoy laughing hysterically at things that are weird, awkward, and just plain strange, this is definitely something you should buy."
5,rox the no-no's,"Thank you, Wal-Mart staff, for ignoring release dates & offering this for sale 3 days early.Extras? I haven't even got there yet. 13 solid episodes that are watchable, then rewatchable, are holding my attention marvelously. Big, beautiful Extra Color, nice sound, spartan package exterior disguising lush watercolors inside...Another Williams Street goldmine, with season 2 arriving to our screens shortly.If you're even vaguely familiar to the Adult Swim format, you know this is a cornerstone - buy it, if just to continue funding for whatever WS/AS has next for us. Plus, it's Wharburton! Nailing yet another role.A personal favorite."
4,Don't heitate to get!,A hilarious show. I remember watching it on tv once and i was hooked. I had to get this on DVD. Now its here! Don't hesitate to get this.
4,Johnny Quest on drugs,"This is a great collection of season one which includes the pilot and a very special Christmas episode. The extra features include a bizarre set of live-action interviews with the creators dressed as various characters on the set of the fictious ""Ventures Brothers Movie"". There is also an entertaining, behind the scenes look at how Hank and Dean are animated.Overall, the collection is pretty good but the commentary feature leaves a lot to be desired. The creators just sort of babble on for twenty-two minutes, making inane comments that have nothing to do with the show or how it was made. Maybe they've never listened to a commentary before and don't understand what its purpose is."
5,One of the funniest shows ever,"The previous reviews have the premise and quality nailed, but what is often overlooked is the genius of the timing and editing of this show. It just pops from moment to moment and never misses a beat. Lots of cinematic techniques are used and used well (split screens, etc.) One of the most perfectly executed shows I've ever seen, and totally hilarious."
5,Can watch this over and over and over again.,"The 2 disc DVD collection is excellent, especially for an old comics geek like me. The inside cover is illustrated by Bill Sienkiewicz(sp), which is very cool. The second disc includes some fun extras (and some really stupid ""interview"" bits).I am looking to getting v.2 when it comes out. I don't buy many DVD sets but this is too good not to have.And the episodes are easy to watch over and over again because there's so much in them. Unlike Futurama and Family Guy or ATHF which after one view, I'm done. Venture Bros keeps giving.I like it."
5,BUY IT - IT'S LIKE THE GEN XER'S BIBLE,"I wasn't born in this country, and have become assimilated in to the American pop culture of the 70s and 80s. I do remember watching Jonny Quest when I was a child and felt the immediate familiarity of the Venture Bros. when it first came on. Frankly, I'm rather proud of myself for being able to get the humor and really laugh goofishly outloud at the jokes. The unabashed crassness, the sexuality, the cultural references... it's fantastic. It really does identify with a genexer's point of view of non-conformity, reality and pessimism towards life.The real reason to buy this DVD is that it's damned funny. It's hilarious, perfectly timed with the music, perfect voice-overs, amazing, memorable characters, and it's truly quality entertainment. If I were rich, I'd personally hire the entire staff to pound out season 3, 4, 5, 6... and squeeze out every single drop of of talent and funniness out of the writers and actors."
5,I love this show,"This is one of my favorite shows on tv, it's simply hilarious! Picture an adult version of Johnny Quest or The Hardy Boys and you got The Venture Brothers. I couldn't think of a better voice for Brock Samson than Patrick Warburton, his deadpan acting style is spot on for Brock. This show is brilliant to say the least, looking foward to season 2, which starts June 25!"
4,I heart Dean Venture,"Since I bought this dvd, I've watched it beginning to end fourteen times. The creator commentary is delightful, but I wish there were more episodes included. The extra material, though interesting, also left a smidgeon to be desired. Get this dvd, love this dvd, and don't forget about Season 2!"
5,A MUST HAVE !!!!,"Don't doubt this one - even if you havn't ever seen it. The scripts are well written and it amazes me every time I watch it. The humor is outstanding. You will laugh until it hurts. My favorite characters are Dean Venture, The Monarch, Molotave Cocktease and of course Brock Samson. Buy it. Right Now. (go ahead and get Harvey Birdman while you're here - it ranks right up there with this, but the humor is a little more adult)."
4,"Great, great show","The Venture Brothers is a top-notch show that deserves a wide audience. Publick and Hammer have slammed it out of the park with this.However, I'm going to rain on the 5-star party here by docking the DVD set one star for the disappointing commentary. There's not much discussion of what's going on in the show - the commentary is mostly self-indulgent mutual admiration.And why wasn't the Rocky Horror theater sequence (one of the few bits of interesting commentary) in the 'Deleted Scenes""?However, on the plus side of the DVD extras is the ""Behind the scenes of the live action Venture Brothers movie"". Outstanding!And, don't forget to have a scientastic day!"
1,Pretty Lame,What a dissappointment! Previous reviews had me believe this was brilliant - it's not. Great packaging - fantastic packaging - but the cartoon stlye and the jokes are pretty average. Did not laugh out loud once.
3,lettering is faint,"I was disappointed when the spinny speller arrived. In the picture, the lettering looks very clear and dark - but with the one I got the lettering seems faint. I called the company that makes them and they said that was normal. It's still a cool spelling toy and is sturdy, but I felt the picture was deceiving."
2,Poor DVD quality,The DVD started to have problem with blur images and slow starting within two weeks. I do not know how long this one will last. My mom used it everyday. I guess that is the problem. It is probably good for less than 10 uses.
2,Good Receiver - Horrible Service,"The HK AVR-65 is a great receiver - especially when trying to put together a DTS system on a relatively ""sane"" budget. The sound quality and features are unmatched for a receiver in this price class. The problem is with HK's backing of the product. Four months ago the center channel on mine went dead. A fluke by the statements of the service technician. HK still cannot deliver the parts to repair the unit. The repair technician has told me that this kind of treatment is typical from HK. After numerous calls to HK's service department I have decided to sell all of the HK equipment I currently own. So if you feel ""lucky"" I strongly recommend the AVR-65. But if you even have the smallest problem with it you might as well throw it in the nearest dumpster and buy a sunfire."
2,Poor quality control shoots down a great receiver,"The AVR-65 has the potential to be a great low to mid-range receiver. It handles the all basics (DD5.1, DTS, 6-channel analog, coax, and optical inputs, S-Video switching) nicely, without the added complexity of DSP modes and dozens of buttons and front panel lights you'll never use.Unfortunately, H/K quality control has fallen down on the job. Internet review sites are awash in stories of AVR-65 owners experiencing an inordinate amount of hum, hiss, and RF interference. Mine is suffering from only the first two. H/K doesn't seem to want to own up to the problems at all. At this point, even if I can manage to get it fixed, I'm soured on the brand.Too bad. Features wise, it's great, and when adjusted to volume levels that mask the hum/hiss, it sounds very nice. But the problems are unacceptable for a product at this price point, from a company with the kind of good reputation Harman/Kardon has. (Had.)"
2,The AVR65 could have been better and should have!,"After many years of owning H/K equipment, including a Citation 16 that is still in service, I thought the AVR 65 was going to be the perfect A/V receiver for my surround system. Within three hours of hooking it up I experienced hum, noise, and an intermitent problem with the optical input. The end result was the AVR65 being replaced with the less expensive, yet equally capable, Onkyo TX-DS575. Both have discrete stages and HCC. If you are looking for an low/mid range A/V receiver, the Onkyo is the way to go. Both the H/K and the Onkyo have a similar limtation in the number and type of video inputs. I did not find this annoying on either one as the best picture will be possible with a direct link to the monitor."
3,Not quite enough!!,"During my research for a quality A/V receiver, I looked at products from Pioneer, Kenwood & Denon, among others. The HK AVR65 has only 4 A/V inputs & no S-Video input on the front. I have a need for a minimun for 5-6 A/V inputs & the wish for easy connection for a camera, etc., plus inputs for future expandibility. So, I am looking elsewhere."
3,A good receiver but not a great one.,"It seems to have all the features that I want and I don't notice the problems that many others are saying about the receiver (excess noise, etc). The one downside that I have noticed with this receiver is that the volume does not go low enough. It reaches a level of volume and then simply sets the volume to zero. I like to have music when I first get into bed but the lowest volume is too loud for me for many different types of music."
3,GOOD BUT NOT GOOD ENOUGH !!,ITS A GREAT REC> BUT !!!!!!! THE NEXT ONE I BUY WILL BE A DENNON BY FAR BETTER SOUND !!!!!! I never knew how much of a diff. in sound a rec. can produce til i listened to a pair of klipsh first with the arv65 HK then same speakers but with a dennon avr GOD NOW I KNOW !!!! THE dennon blew the doors off HK65 totaly made same set of speakers sound so dam diff at same volume !!!!! try it next time your in tweeters you will hear a big diff.
2,Big Promises with little return,"I had owned HK equipment since the first Citation series came out. When I first saw the 65, I thought this would be the ideal receiver. From minute one I had nothing but problems with it. Noise, Hum and RF interference that I had never encountered before. I now have an Onkyo TX-DS575. It has the same discrete circuitry as the HK and I have experienced none of the problems not to mention it is a LOT less expensive. Overall, the HK was a great idea poorly executed. Buy the Onkyo and use the extra money to buy a few DVDs to add to your collection."
4,Great!,"It's got good information, most of the stuff I already knew, being a fan way before Tragic Kingdom, but the pictures in the book are great! The cd was pretty funny at times, and the information was good."
1,DVD Movie Factory 4,it is no good because everything that i put on dvd the voices and video are out of sync
1,Poor Software and Terrible Support,"Short and sweet:(1) program crashes for no reason when burning to DVD.(2) after using ""Reduce size to fit a DVD"" program crashes.(3) after editing and using ""Joining/Separating video"" audio is always out of sync, and I have tried everything to make it work.(4) save anything to file after editing and the first several frames flicker.(5) after 30 days, forget it, the support you were promise will disappear. You can e-mail them all you want, they will not answer."
1,DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is the worst software EVER!!! If I could give it less than 1 star, I would. Constantly freezing up computer and have wasted too much of my life trying to get it to work! The programmers have tried to make this software look ""fancy"" by giving it brushed aluminum skins, but this just slows it down and wastes memory. They should have made this software DO WHAT IT IS SUPPOSED TO DO, and that is make DVDs! It is no wonder that people want to buy Macs when PCs are drug down by this kind of garbage software. Am uninstalling this from my computer and buying anything but Ulead products from now on."
5,Marks-G,"ULEAD Movie Maker 3 was part of the software package when I purchased my computer. Everyone swears by Nero, but I have found ULEAD to be extremly user frienly and simple. I have had no problems with burns. After reading the comments I feel fortunate to have the software meet my needs. I downloaded the trail of Nero and after one use I removed it from my computer. I'm ordering ULEAD 4 only because I want to share the program with several computers and prefer the most recent version on my Lap Top.FYI: I ordered AynDVD recently to backup movies from a disc to the HDD. I use DVD shrink for compression(6gig to 4gig)and last,ULEAD has been great for burning the compressed files to disc."
2,Materials yes - Techniques not really,"I wish I'd read the other reviews carefully before ordering this. I have The Practice of Tempera Painting by Thompson (which is very detailed on the technical aspects of tempera painting) and I was expecting something similar here. Unfortunately it is heavy on material info (mostly about the pigments used) but almost nothing usable about medieval painting techniques or methods.Since most of the pigments mentioned are extremely toxic it's doubtful the book would be of much use except as a source of historical information. I, for one, would never have these pigments (lead, arsenic, mercury, etc) in my studio in powdered form. Very dangerous stuff!"
4,"A medieval painting cookbook, not a style manual","I'm not sure what I was expecting, but the ""materials and techniques"" were mostly on what pigments were used, and how all the different paints were manufactured. Usually using really toxic materials and methods.Don't get me wrong, it was fascinating, but not the how-to-paint in a medieval style manual that I had hoped.A great reference if you want to take your life into your hands and cook up authentic medieval paints and pigments.Mmmmm. Lead, Copper, Arsenic and Mercury, My Favorite!"

4,Pulling no punches,"I must admit that I'm a bit biased toward this book, because I know the author, and I know that over twenty years of research are represented here. What started out as part-time digging through coroner records and dusty court files turned into a full-time research project, and the results are staggering. It's a pity Sherlock's style is so brash. His tabloid tone detracts from the credibility of all his hard work. But believe me, he can fully document every tale he tells and every claim he makes. It's worth plowing through his digressions and diatrabes to get to the meat of the matter -- solid documentation of deaths, injuries, rapes, sordid abortion clinics, corruption that staggers belief. Just keep in mind as you read this book that the first reports of Nazi atrocities were dismissed as too fantastic to be believed. When Sherlock speaks, believe him. There is a wealth of information here, and Sherlock's biting words can be appropriate, given the subject matter."
1,Top heavy item!,I bought this item last year from another retailer for my children. My younger child had knocked it over onto my older one about 30 times in two weeks when i returned it.
4,chicco kitchen great!!!!!!,"This product is great for boys because of the colors. We have it in our dinning area next to the kitchen its small and doesnt take up to much room. Perfect for one child. When i am making dinner it keeps my son occupied, so i can get things done, he also feels like he's helping with dinner. I am very satisfied......"
3,Not for a busy 3 yr. old,"I bought this kitchen set for my grandson, who just turned 3. His mother had noticed he liked to take her kitchen things and ""cook"" in their living room.This looked sturdy enough, with plenty of utensils and pots, dishes, even ""food"".Unless we took the time to pretend play with my grandson and this kitchen set, he mostly threw the many accessories. The set falls over unless you're gentle. The hanging hooks for the cooking utensils don't hold them if the tower is moved at all.There is a lot of color and the pieces are sturdy. I do think it has a lot of potential.I would say that this kitchen is not for a 3 yr. old or for a child who either will play alone and/or is easily distracted from a pretend play story. Probably an older child, not a toddler, with someone to share it, would be better."
4,Great!,"My daughter loves this kitchen! She got it for her 2nd birthday and plays with it all the time. It's just the right height, has lots of extra pieces, and has cool lights and sound. It's an excellent value!"
2,Lost sound in less than 1 hour play,"When my 3.5 year old son received this toy, he started to play with it right away. However, after less than 1 hour play, the sound is gone which the most fun part of the toy. Both him and I were very disappointed by this. I've never had any toy that gone bad that fast. Not sure whether it is our bad luck or this toy has bad quality issue."
4,An actual musician!,"If your a Beck fan or not you should check out this album. It is too bad he's not sticking with this type of sound. The meledy and placement of certain sounds is amazing. Er, that is goes for some tracks. A few sound like you just entered a tavern or something(Bottle of Blues, Canceled Check) But not to say these songs are straight out bad though, none of them are. My point being is Beck is one of the few artists that still relize what music actually is; Meledy! The right placement of sound. If you like this album I strongly suggest the recent Smashing Pumpkins effort, Adore. Another great album in the same vein. Not much real music out there anymore so come inside Mutations and actually liten to good sound, you won't regret it."
1,Coaster Material,"If you liked Odelay, don't buy this album. It's as if someone took all the slow, boring, mind-numbing, zero writing effort songs from Odelay and made an entire album out of it. Save your money and use an AOL CD for a coaster."
1,"Beck should end his career as a ""musician.""","When I first heard ""Odelay"" I was quite upset but it did contain a few okay songs, I suppose. And ""Midnite Vultures""...well, that was just plain awful. But I'm here to review a different piece of garbage entitled ""Mutations."" This is by far one of the worst beck albums ever! And like ""Midnite Vultures"" and ""Odelay"" it has a few things in common. These albums are all over produced, uninspired, and pretentious(can anyone else smell a sell-out here?). It is quite obvious that beck has gone done hill and he is never coming back."
5,"Odelay it isn't, but the sky's the limit for Beck Hansen","So you were hoping that ""Mutations"" was going to be a continuation of ""Odelay,"" Beck Hansen's top-selling album mixing folk, rock, hip-hop, and just about any other genre onto one album. Well, sorry, ""Mutations"" resembles ""Odelay"" in about two ways: ""Ramshackle"" and ""Jack-ass."" What Beck has done on ""Mutations"" is created something much more insightful and even soothing, but he still retains some of the diversity you've come to expect. ""Tropicalia"" is pure bossa nova, and is about the closest to a dance track on the whole album. ""O Maria"" sounds something like funeral march in the 1920s. But the best track is easily ""Sing It Again."" Following a waltz-style beat, its very simple, but its also a beautiful song which can prove that Beck is one the best songwriters in alt-rock. May the Bob Dylan comparisons continue!"
5,My favorite Beck CD,"I am a Beck fan. In many ways I think that he's the ""John Lennon"" of our generation. I love that he is a true independent in the big-business music world, experimenting with styles and music technology with a sort of child-like abandon.That said, this is my favorite of his releases. It is sort of like the quiet middle child between Odelay and Mellow Gold (though it's not chronologically in the middle). It's the one with the real story to tell. The songs are dark in a way, but not gloomy. Beck really creates a mood here and what I presume is a sense of his inner world. And his voice is so smooth and cool. The tunes are so tight and hummable. The three-time beats are so unusual and so catchy. If you're prone to swaying to music, these songs will have you swaying, as though they're grown-up lullabies."
5,"""Mutations"" is a musical photo-album! Beck is brilliant!","A loyal Beck obsessor, I wasn't quite sure what toe expect when I handed over the dough for his latest album, ""Mutations"". By the second song, however, I was in love with it. It's soulful harmonies and melodies work together in ways that Beck hasn't experimented with before. He is a musical genius in so many ways. I think this album has a little something for everyone. You should defenitely invest in this."
5,One of my current favorites,"I tried not to analyze this CD when I bought it, just to listen to it. I let the music wave over me. And it got me. The melodies started to grab my brain, and I started to hum them after I was through listening. For a while I felt withdrawal when I wasn't listening to it. I NEEDED to hear it. I love the music, the rhythms, the words. Now I'm starting to read through the words and they are complex poetry. This is a very valuable artistic album, just right in terms of production. I've heard people say Beck sold out when he made this album. That he just put out a quick album to make some money, not really trying. Remember the Beatles' ""White Album?"" The same things could've been said about it. They followed a highly produced album (Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band) with a mostly acoustic, low-production sing-a-long type album. But it had great music on it! Listen to ""Mutations."" It is beautiful, fun, and challenging. Great music."
5,Beck mutates...,"When I first bought this album, I must say I was slightly dissapointed. The tunes on this album were not the funk-stewn tracks of Odelay, nor were they riddled with the goofy incoherence of his previous records. However, after listening every song for quite a while, I've come to the realization that this is by far his greatest work yet! I love each and every song on this album, from the pleasant folkitude of ""Dead Melodies"" to the upbeat blueseyness of ""Bottle of Blues"", to the completely awesome beatlesesque ""Lazy Flies"", each one still retaining an unmistakably Beckkish flavor. I reccomend this to anybody, even if you don't even like music at all!!! GET THIS ALBUM!!!"
2,what went wrong,i've been hearing tracks on the radio and...i don't know... the music is more complex and musical but it's corny rather than goofy or funny or slick. and thats a bad thing rather than a good thing.i liked the dirrection of that last movie single.but these tracks are off track. i'm not buying it.high llamas do it much much better.
2,please don't compare him to the beatles,"My roommates at school were rather obsessed with Beck, so I've listened to this many many times. This is not the most energetic music I've ever heard, and it's not nearly as cool as his earler stuff of which I am a fan. ""Nobody's Fault..."" used to get stuck in my head consistently, and it really made me want to put a gun to my head. I'm giving it two stars because it isn't a complete waste of money, ""Lazy Flies"" is a quasi-decent song among a few others, but there's a plethora of better CD's on which to spend your hard-earned buck."
3,"Some good, some mediocre","I like about half of the songs on this album. Cold Brains, Nobody's Fault But My Own, We Live Again, Tropicalia, Static, and *especially* Diamond Bollocks are the best songs. Diamond Bollocks, the hidden last track, is the most interesting track by far. Just wild.The lyrics are downers. Misery, filth, social decay, death, and other wonderful topics. Even the ""art"" in the CD Booklet is just downright weird and somewhat disturbing. A severed finger (using red crayons to simulate veins and nerve endings), a bizarre suspended male doll complete with intestine-like background patterns. What the heck?Anyway, if you can get past all that, there actually are some pretty good tracks on this album."
2,What the happened to Beck?,"Apparently Beck has been hitting the bong a little more than usual...he's gone soft on us. This CD was somewhat disappointing, going from the genre-shifting style of Odelay and (to a lesser extent) Mellow Gold, and has switched into new-age mellow (quite mellow...like sleepytime mellow)...Frankly, I don't like this CD very much. It doesn't really do anything for me...it just sounds weird, and not in a good way like the last two albums. I love Beck's other two CDs, and if you're expecting that in this CD, then you will be disappointed. Better luck next time, Mr. Hansen."
2,Re-Consideration...,"People who aren't Hardcore Beck fans probably wouldn't want to buy this album... Beck's music is generally stereo-typed as a very ""retro"" feel, and in this album, you get the complete opposite. If your new to Beck's music, start at an earlier album and work your way up. Because this one isn't that impressive if you don't ""get"" Beck."
1,Beyond repair!,"I think Beck went to his mother's attic and found her 60's LP's... and mixed them on this CD, with his cobainesque whiny 'vocals' & poorly disguised xerox repro of 60's Caetano Veloso.What a sorry excuse of a record. I paid $3.50 for it, and it should've been half that price."
1,Totally not what I was expecting or hoping for,"I am one of those listeners who really enjoyed Odelay and couldn't wait to buy Beck's new album. However, I am really disappointed with this album. It is not that I think that it is a necessarily bad album but it is just a totally different style - very folksy - and this style doesn't appeal to me. I do like some acoustic artists but that is not why I buy Beck. Many people are saying that this album reflects some growth and maturity in Beck, but I don't think the funkiness of Odelay was immature or sophmoric. It was just simply a DIFFERENT style, which I think will be missed by many who really enjoyed Odelay."
5,This is my favorite Beck cd,"Why is this my favorite Beck cd? It is introspective, but not too self centered. There is humor here. There is the layering and texturing of sounds that Mr Hanson is so meticulous with. There is excellent music here. There is A Bottle of Blues here. But remember, no matter what I say or do that its nobody's fault but my own."
5,another appealing set of tunes,"For some reason I didn't expect much from Mutations so it was a pleasant surprise listening to Beck's new album. It's not son of Odelay which would have been interesting. Instead it's a more sedate set of stylized pop tunes with undercurrents of folk music, synths, loops and guitar textures. The album's sound is warm and inviting. The songs are sincere which is what makes this a strong album. If this is a holding period in Beck's career he can hang as long as he likes. Most artist would kill to have a follow up that is as strong as this album. In fact, one of the reasons it works so well is because it lacks that push to outdo Odelay. Instead we get a well written, well produced album that stands up on it's own."
5,Lovely Songwriting,"The more I hear from Beck, the more impressed I am. Odelay was great in its way, but Mutations shows that underneath the flashy sound effects, sampling, bizarre instrumentation, and other tricks, lies a real songwriting talent. I may be going out on a limb here, but I think Beck just may stand up well in comparison with Ray Davies, Syd Barrett, Richard Thompson, etc."
4,"It's good, but is it Beck?","Owning previous Beck CDs, I bought ""Mutations"" after seeing Beck live in concert in December 1998. I heard some strange songs in concert, but very few were actually on this CD. Don't get me wrong- ""Mutations"" is good, but it really isn't Beck-sounding, if that makes any sense. I suggest you borrow it from someone before you buy, if you are expecting Beck."
2,Bleck!,"If a rock group ever puts Jabberwocky to music, it will be Beck. The lyrics are a mish-mash imagery which is so incomprehensible as to be as boring as Beck sounds throughout the album. This is a combination of several older styles, most noteworthy being The Beatles, Pink Floyd and Bob Dylan; yet it does so without being innovative. And why is it every Alternative group has to have a stupid buried track at the end of their album? Honestly, the buried track is more interesting than the rest of this work."
3,Gotta love the beck,"Now it doesn't do what Odelay did. But it never tried to. Although the funk and old time soundin grooves put in work, they just dont sizzle like his older tunes. He makes you feel wierd (in a good way) but forgets to come rescue you with some beck familiarity. And also it's a short record. Good but not great."
5,Bexellent!!,"This album is so incredibly beautiful; each track consisting of well played music set to wonderful melodies and slick production. I'd be willing to say that when it comes to producing really good songs, Mutations is several inches above Odelay. With hardly ever a weak spot, Beck proves to be the master of 90s alternative music."
4,"""Simplistic and Excellent""","Beck gets back to the basics on this cd. I have bought many of Beck`s cds including his latest cd ""Midnite Vultures"". ""Mutations"" is entirely different from the fast paced beats and many sound effects in ""Midnite Vultures""(which I also enjoyed). ""Mutations"" is a great combination of many different styles of guitars,soft sounds and great vocals. The effort and talent oozes out of this cd as Beck once again shows what a great and talented performer he really is. This cd is well worth your $$$."
5,the acoustic side of beck,"i never thought this album would work because its so different from odelay but it does work. beck plays all kinds of music and it works.""cold brains"" is great and ""cancelled check"" takes the prize.the rest of the songs are great dont get me wrong but the two i mentioned are just great! ""static"" and ""tropicalia"" sound like they could be from ""odelay"" but they fit just right with the rest of the more slow songs on this album."
5,Beck's eternal album,a lot of people know Beck for his studio hyjinks or his clever lyrics but i think on Mutations he finally throws away all the cover ups and just makes good songs. It doesn't capture the times as well as other albums but when people look back this is the one they'll remember.
5,My Favorite Beck Album,"This is very different from Odelay, its much more stripped down and raw. This album is much more mature, his lyrics have improved greatly. My favorite tracks are Cold Brains, Lazy Flies and Tropicalia. I probably wouldn't start out with this as your first Beck album, probably Odelay. Mutations is more of an aquired taste, more acoustic and folky. Mutations is an amazing album and shouldn't be compared to his other albms because Beck does new and innovative on every single one of his albums. If you are more into a party/dance album...buy Odelay. But if you want to hear in my opinion, Beck at his best, buy Mutations."
5,Constantly in my CD player,"Good gravy, this Beck fella's talented. And I don't mean merely in the lyrics department--my feeling is that he's still learning to control his tongue. Even the music on this disc is enough to get you hooked. I can't stop singing and/or humming these tunes. They go everywhere, it seems. To call this album ""folky"" (see below) is to miss the point. This goes way beyond ""folk"" (I'd like to meet the ""folk"" who dabble in this strange hybridity). Bonus: the Japanese version gives you two extra tracks that are *maybe* as good as anything else on the disc. ""Electric Music and the Summer People"" has a surfy, sixties, party feel to it, while ""Runners Dial Zero"" has an eerie, driving-late-at-night vibe. Outstanding disc, all told. I only wish he would've played some of these songs when I saw him live several months ago. This is a CD I won't even leave at my girlfriend's house."
5,Well worth the purchase!,"A huge leap from his CD Stereopathetic Soulmanure, Beck delivers some great melodies, I love this CD. Odelay is still a great CD, but this has to be my favorite."
4,"""Immitatations"" / ""Mutations""","Beck on this record, emulates my favourite artists sounds with such precision, timing, and compositional excellences, it's really hard not to like the brilliance of this recording.Other artists of today/of recent memory have tried to emmulate older artists rather unsuccefully creating ""garbage"" music.Beck on the other hand...At times he's like a melding of Brian Wilson/Bob Dylan into one creative force."
4,Manic Beck interlude,"Having seen the funky Beck twice in concert recently, this is a refreshing change of pace. Much more mellow and ascerbic, very enjoyable."
5,"A classic album, full of awesome songs.","Beck is one of the greatest musicians of his time, and again shows this with Mutations. One of the keys to this album is Becks lyrics, and with the absolutley unreal music, Beck gets an amazing sound that is bound to become a classic album. The entire album is breathtaking, you are able to listen to it over and over again and never once get bored with it."
1,"Donna Summer hits covered by group, ""Unlimited Beat""","Realize that this collection is not a compilation mix of hits sung by Donna Summer. It is a lame attempt by Unlimited Beat to ""cover"" her songs in a 10 minute medley that has no soul, creativity, or reason for being. A total waste of time and money...and a crass rip off."
1,Bad Rip-Off Attempt,Donna Summer fans will be sadly disappointed in this rip off of her music...this does her NO justice! Don't waste any $$$ on this one!
1,Useless,"Maybe this book will work for a child or an old person who does not even know internet exists. But if you are reading this is because you are modern, so you do not need a book to tell you you have to innovate. Absolutely useless. For young children."
4,"bueno, interesante","es un buen libro. ameno e interesante. aunque algunos lo clasifiquen como libro para babies, estoy seguro que les ha ayudado a desbloquearse en un momento u otro.por algo sera un best seller y por algo infinidad de empresas que aparecen en Forbes lo recomiendan a sus empleados."
2,Good Gloves?,"I purchased these gloves for some hand protection which I needed for my motorcycle class. I wore these for the duration for the class which, while not a lot of time, gave me eight hours to test them out in summer heat.First off some good points. They're vented which aids in keeping your hands cooler than plain leather. The pad on the inside of the palm is thicker than the rest of the glove which, usually being the first place to hit the ground, makes them a touch more durable. Also the leather itself is more supple than most cowhide.Now for the bad news. While they're vented, the cooling it adds is negligible. Also the seam for the leather is on the inside and that is its biggest flaw. As you ride the seam digs into your skin and starts irritating it.Overall, they're cheap but it might be worth it to spring for a nicer pair if only to avoid the inner seam."
5,Very good book,"This is a terrific book to understand lutheran liturgy. It traces liturgical events to their direct roots in christian history.And NO, Lutheranism is not a Mickey Mouse religion at all. Whoever claims this obviously has no clue as to what they are taking about."
5,Wonderful story,"The ancient story of a young boy named Lugalbanda, is told in this beautiful book. Taken from Sumerian cuneiform tablets just translated in the 1970's, Lugalbanda's epic adventure from 5000 years ago takes place in what is now southern Iraq. War, a giant bird with shark-like teeth, sickness, and triumph make this an exciting story for readers and listeners alike. Jane Ray enhances the work with her watercolor, ink and collage illustrations. Excellent notes before and after the story are included."
4,I love my Cocker Spaniels,"I thought twice about ordering this sign when I first saw the price. I am so glad I ordered it anyway. It is very well made and heavy. I have always owned Cocker Spaniels and I now have two 4 month old puppies and they are my ""babies"". I am hanging the sign over their beds in their bedroom.(I know, TMI)."
3,Good book for the basic users,"I had a specific goal in purchasing this book, to learn to to import all kinds of documents in to Summation. It covered loading a transcript and that is all, in about 2 sentences. So it is a very basic book and didn't accomplish what I purchased it for. However, for someone with little to no experience with the Summation product this is a good user manual (too bad they dont include one with the software)."
4,great game!!!!!!,"I bought this for my boyfriend as a bday gift he said it was a great game. The game is for the old xbox but you can still play it on the xbox 360(I had no idea their's a difference between xbox/xbox360). He did say it was a difficult game but did complete it in 4 days :) As he was playing the game, he just figured out what button(s) does what."
5,Stay up all night book!,"Until the bough breaks was my first book of Christine McGuires, but it definitely will not be my last. My only regret is that I did not read the others first. But that will not stop me from going out to find the others. Keep up the good work. You have another devoted fan."
3,when Conan Doyle played Holmes,"This novel is a biography of Arthur Conan Doyle and George Edalji, son of a Parsee clergy and a scottish woman.Conan Doyle cleared George's name from the false accusations mainly due to racial prejudices, despite the efforts of police to avoid to reopen the case and confess to a big mistake(George had been arrested,put in prison and condemned to seven years of penal servitude. It's ironical that Doyle, who hated Holmes, had to play the detective, but anyway he made a valiant and generous effort to help an unknown man, despite the attacks he had to face.I liked the tale and appreciated the chance to know more about Doyle's personality, but I've found the tale a little bit too long and I think that the author should have to make them meet earlier in the story; the junction between the two lives, in the book, arrives a little bit too late. Anyway, it's a well-written book, and I liked it even if I can't say to be fond of it."
4,Great Gothic Rock!,This is their first CD and its amazing! Great songs both hard-core as well as calming and peaceful. Their music is great! They're working on new stuff now and they just released Live In Chicago 2002 which is now on sale at the online store.
3,Slit my wrists with paper clips and staple shut my mouth...,The duration of the cd is restless unsettled and unique in its melodramtic choruses. The album has some good songs but others you wait for something that you know is not going to occur. Some excelent songs but their newer items (zerospace) are much more developed and stronger..yet good to get yuor head around lifes mysteries
3,No update of Compton's 'bible' in over 20 years shows the state of Field Geology,"I think the true state of field geology is illustrated by the date of this pub and the lack of a much needed revision, the movement towards 'black box' geology in 30 years, an aging cohort of old-timer geologists who have not been able to pass the torch of field work on to a large number of younger generation geologists, in addition to the old timers' inability to keep up with recent technological advances in field methods and techniques (like the laptop!)How is it that recent field HYDROGEOLOGY books are being published at a rapid pace for practitioners, but Compton's book is still being praised by these other Amazon reviewers as though god him/herself wrote the thing?Useful yes, but if this is the best we're going to get for years, students will need to supplement w/ online field geology developments."
3,D&RGW Caboose,"While this car has the correct look for one of these cabooses, the green tinted windows are certainly out of place. Also, the Denver & Rio Grande Western lettering on one side is backward, instead reading ""Western Denver & Rio Grande"". this will (because of the look) become a ""project car"" as soon as I can find decals & more prototypical boxcar red paint. It does, however track and roll very nicely..."
4,"It's fun with a lot of bells and whisles, but for power...",...Go elsewhere. This is a very wimpy gun. But that's not what I bought it for. Sometimes looks and fun functions are anough.
3,Hmm...,"I saw another @ $14.99 - better reviews than this. And please - previous reviewer, you need either to get on some medication or off some medication. Just some words of advice to help your health."
1,mastic gum,I did not like this supplement due to it causing me to have more painful heart burn and an upset stomach. I also put 1 in water to see how long it takes to dissolve and it takes more than 48 hours to dissolve
3,too short a discussion,"Bankston offers a primary school readership an introduction to the story of the founder of the American hydrogen bomb. He relates Teller's life in the context of World War 2 and the Cold War. A rather bleak backdrop that reflects the sombre nature of the story.Given the background of the audience and the length of this slim book, there is little discussion of the complexities of Teller's long life and the controversial issues and passions he evoked in many. Perhaps a young reader will be interested enough to pursue a fuller history of the man and his times."
4,"Not quite super, but good enough","There are two DVDs available of this particular Super Guitar Trio, one from Cambridge, Mass, in 1990, and this one from Montreux in 1989. The Montreux is 10 minutes longer, but there's considerable overlap of tunes between the two. I own both, but it's really not necessary--one or the other will suffice. Take your pick. The two DVDs each provide very enjoyable listening, but are not essential items. The three guitarists' styles are so different, and yet they for the most part find ways not to clash or distract from one another."
5,Best condom I've ever used!,"I am SO glad I decided to give these a try. I'm someone who has never really been able to enjoy myself with a condom on. I've tried Magnums but those felt like a trash bag to me... way too thick. These are amazing, larger for those of us who need a bit more room, but still thin enough to really feel good. I can honestly say these are the best condoms I've ever used and I will definitely be ordering more. If you are a slightly larger guy, I would whole-heartedly recommend giving these a try."
1,"Character development, a let down...","But that's not all. I did not really feel anything for these characters, as they were not fully developed. Furthermore, Rose, Opal & Ned seemed to morph into almost similiar personalities by the end of the book. (Near the end, Opal swears less than she did earlier in the book; Rose more; Ned the same.) I kept reading, because I thought the story might be interesting, even if the writing style was a little annoying. Then, I got to the end and was further dissappointed. The ending did seem quite unplausable, reminding me of a made for TV movie. I read this book and instead of the satisfied feeling you typically get after a good book, I felt that I wasted my time."
2,A Struggle,"Not only was it a struggle to finish this novel, I found the struggle of the characters overcoming their problems very depressing. There was nothing ""normal"" about their attempts to overcome their hardships. Rose never got on with her life until Opal entered the picture; Ned could never get on with his life because of Rose; Opal's immature handling of her problems could have produced nothing but the conclusion arrived at.I did like the literary style and how the time frames overlapped with each chapter devoted to one of the characters with the viewpoint and thoughts of that particular character.I had high hopes for this book and author whom I had never read before from reading the glowing reviews. Doubt I will read her again. I'd best stick to my thrillers and mysteries!"
1,Horrible program!,"This may be a sophificated program, but give me a break! I've spent 2 days trying to just enlarge a snap shot to an 8x10 size ( which I was able to do with my eyes closed with the Adobe photo shop home edition 3.0). But when I got a new printer and Windows XP, I couldn't use the old program. I hate this thing!! Shame on you for making it so user unfriendly. I'll try to get my money back,"
3,"A &#65533;classic&#65533; of sorts, outdated, but still cute&#65533;","This is the story of the life of one adventurous wooden doll named Hitty. First made for a young girl in Maine, the doll travels around the world and back passing from one youngster to another and recounts her journey along the way. Since the book was written in 1929, it gives it a certain charm to the author?s writing, at the same time though; the author occasionally uses terms that would not be considered ?politically correct? today. I know many older books do this, but since this book is geared towards children, I think I might substitute in more appropriate words if reading to a youngster. However, despite this, I found this book a cute story that gives you a look at how people were viewed and supposedly acted during the 1800s, where the story takes place."
5,Super-fast shipping!,"JJoybooks had this shipped to me very quickly. I was very impressed with their good service; in addition to receiving my order so soon, the book was in good condition--just as described in their listing.Thanks very much, JJoybooks."
2,Trip to the past,"Copyright date: 1929...Odd to think that my mother might have run across this book as a little girl and read it....I remember reading it myself as a little girl. Like many of the older Newbery books, it is a window into the past, a little trip into life for kids before TV and computers and iPods.Hitty is a wooden doll made in the early 1800's. She passes into many hands and along the way she becomes the most literate of dolls. One girl after another owns her, though her painted features fade and her various dresses come and go. She has a series of exciting adventures: she lands in a tree, in a shipwrecked, on a deserted island worshipped as an idol (!), on a steamship, under the cushion of an old couch, in an exhibition, and, finally, in an antique store. She manages to survive all her adventures with her dignity intact, finding a way to take pleasure in even the least interesting of her situations."
1,Arrived broken,"I don't know if this is an issue with the seller or with the product. I'll say it could have been either, and most likely both. We opened this with my 4-year-old granddaughter on Christmas Eve. The roof pieces were broken beyond repair. I bought it at a good price ... only about $10... very close to Christmas. A last-minute decision. We were going to skip it, but amazingly, my granddaughter remembered the house she got last year (from an uncle), so it clearly now will be a tradition. It wasn't the money so much, of course, but it was too late to do anything about it. I recommend ... if you're going to purchase a gingerbread house kit, get it in-store, where you can see it's in good repair, and spend the extra money to get a good one. Luckily, my granddaughter was a good sport about it, but I'll be careful/wary in the years to come."
3,Tasted great! Everything broken,"The shipping box arrived in great shape. The gingerbread house actual container was in perfect condition. I had a clue that something might be wrong though when jelly beans started to fall out when I picked up the gingerbread box. It turns out, every single piece of gingerbread was broken, and the jellybean bag was ripped open. There were loose jelly beans everywhere. I still give the product a three star (instead of one) because it tastes wonderful. I try to teach my kids to make the best of every situation, so we still decorated the gingerbread anyway. We couldn't make it into a house, but we had beautifully decorated flat gingerbread pieces. It's some of the best gingerbread I have ever tasted. The company did a wonderful job with the actual creation of the product. I'm not sure what happened that so many of the items were broken, but we still enjoyed our Christmas treat anyway."
2,pieces arrived broken,they really need to pack this item better. 3 of the panels were broken upon arrival. i've patched them back together with crazy glue... hopefully this will work
1,terrible product,This was received in pieces and my daughter said the gingerbread tasted like dog biscuits. On the positive side Amazon fully refunded my money.
3,"Good kit, not worth stated price.","I bought 5 of these for a group of girls to assemble at a party. The kits were complete, all pieces were intact after shipping and went together reasonably well.Could use more candy, but otherwise no complaints. The stated price is ridiculous, but the sale price is fair. You can also buy similar kit at Target or Michaelsfor same price, less shipping. I would recommend shopping there first."
1,A Waste of Time and Money,"Most pieces were broken upon arrival. I knew, from baking our own gingerbread houses in the past, that broken pieces could be reassembled using icing. But not the icing that comes with this kit! Ultimately, we tried cutting the broken pieces to form a new gingerbread house. Again, the icing failed -- it wasn't strong enough to keep the pieces together.Tasted good, though."
3,Not the best kit I've used,"We ordered this house to assemble before Christmas. Unfortunately, 2 sides of the house arrived broken in half. We thought we could use the frosting to glue it together but after putting it all together, the cracked pieces caved in. If it hadn't been so close to Xmas, we would have returned it before attempting to assemble it. One other issue is that the kit did not come with a frosting tip (like kits we've used in the past) which made it difficult to apply the frosting."
4,Fun gift,Gifted this to a friend to build with her grand-daughter. They both loved it! And the price is right.
1,CUTE BUT DAMAGED,One of the gingerbread walls arrived broken. Was able to repair as best as possible. CUTE house that would have been much better if not damaged.
3,gingerbread house review,"This house had a number of broken pieces, but they were repairable with the icing. There was not enough candy to really decorate the house."
2,Don't buy this for $24.00!!!!!!,I bought this 'deluxe model' for $24.00 (not including shipping which made the grand total over $29.00). I walked into Target the other day and saw the exact same kit for $9.00! The product is fine but I feel completely ripped off...don't buy it through Amazon.com...go to Target! I wish I had read the reviews before purchasing.
1,NOT a deal,You can buy this EXACT SAME kit at Target for $8.99 (regular price 12.99) and save yourself the outrageous price and ridiculous shipping costs. Normally I like the goldbox deals but this is highway robbery Amazon!
1,horrible,"I wish i could rate it NO STARS, arrived on doorstep and daughter and I opened it to find the house in 1000 pieces!!!! I called the number on the box and company said since we bought through Amazon we would have to deal with them. I sent it back and received full refund withing 7 days."
1,In a hundred pieces and missing candies.,The house was literally in a hundred pieces. All 4 gingerbread men were in pieces and candy was missing from the box. I had to go out and purchase another kit.
2,"good houses, but one out of four broken","The houses were good, plenty of candy, and the kids were happy but one of the four I ordered arrived broken, too broken to fix up with frosting."
4,Not bad...,"I put this kit together tonight with my two young sons and we had a ball. (We paid $10 for it at Fred Meyer, which was $5 off their normal price, so beware that the cost on this site is ridiculously high). The pieces were easy to assemble and the tray that comes with the kit is handy (beats having to find some cardboard to cover with tin foil. My only complaint is the frosting because it got overly gooey before we could finish our assembly and it wasn't tough enough to hold some of the heavier candy. I kept putting it in the fridge to firm it up a little. I'd also recommend cutting the tip of the frosting at less than the 1/4"" that the instructions recommend. I'd say 1/8th"" would have been better. Overall, I was impressed with the finished product. It was easy to clean up the mess, there was plenty of candy and some to spare, and the kids had a blast. I bought a similar kit in the shape of a train and we look forward to putting that one together as well."
3,Drafty house,"Length:: 1:42 MinsWe did have a lot of fun, but after opening the package discovered most of the panels were very broken. Here's Jada and our somewhat drafty, well, very drafty, start of our gingerbread house."
5,Wonderful Gingerbread House!,"This house was quite large and comes with more than enough frosting and candy. Everything is high quality and very fresh. We got 3 houses and had a contest between our children with grandchildren. It was easy and fun for all ages. After a while, we couldn't resist and decorated the extra cookies, then ate them. All the flavors of candies along with of the frosting are delicious! This is a new tradition for us and can't wait to do it again next year. Merry Christmas!"
1,Terrible product,This is the worst product. Not a product to put together with kids. The problem with the product is they don't use royal icing. Their icing is the worst. It may be reasonably priced but put the coffee on and find that it falls apart and the family has a nice treat. If you want it to work make a batch of royal icing. Wilton's is $2.00 more and worth it.
2,Poor Quality,"I ordered this product for my niece as one of her Christmas presents. When I opened the UPS package, the handle to the gingerbread box was broken. The box was also dented in places. The taste of the icing was horrible. However it was a fun project and none of the gingerbread pieces were broken. Would not buy again."
1,Broken in a million pieces,I had this shipped to my home while I was on vacation so I did not see it when it arrived. When I got it it was broken in many pieces and unusable. I will never do business with this company again.
2,Not Dodge's best effort,"I loved Fup (with one of the best opening paragraphs I've seen), thought Not Fade Away was a worthy successor but found Stone Junction fairly lackluster. It is far longer than his previous works and feels like it too. The reference to Dungeons and Dragons above is apt - the book reads like someone who's been locked away with the game for too long. To me, it came off like an adolescent's wish fulfillment."
2,"loved fup, this? well...","i loved the book ""fup"" by jim dodge. this i could not get into. silly idolization of criminals dominates a fantasy that just seemed immature. this reminded me a lot of tom robbins, author of ""even cowgirls get the blues,"" another book i thought lightweight. read ""fup,"" by all means. this one you can safely skip."
2,doesn't compare to FUP,"FUP is, without question, one of my favorite pieces of writing. I have read it over and over, and passed it to many friends. Stone Junction has some entertaining sections, but mostly falls flat -- too many gimmicks, not enough good writing and substance. Forego reading it, and read FUP instead."
4,Good enough,"Here is a live album from the leading punk-rock band of the 70's. Song selection is nice and quality is outstanding. Especially the songs ""Smash it up"" and ""Neat neat neat"" are very successful. You should buy this one."
1,Basted like a Thanksgiving Turkey,"The masseuse at the local spa slathered this product on me today, marveling about how great it makes your skin feel. Exiting the spa into 100 degree temperatures, I felt like I'd been dipped in vegetable oil, ready for the barbeque. I had to wipe off my hands onto paper towels before I could keep a grip on my car's steering wheel, and the leather handles of my new purse became stained. I kept trying to rub it in, but had no success.Two hours after leaving the spa, I was at home reading a magazine in the a/c and when I closed the magazine, I discovered the tops of my thighs were black with ink transferred from the cover. At three hours, I took a shower and used lots of soap to wash it off.I'm glad I didn't fall for the sales pitch at the spa -- I would never recommend this greasy product. 0 stars."
5,Beautiful Book!,"This bok was very eduational and inspirational, I bought for me and I loved it. Recommended if you believe in Angels."
5,angeles,Hermoso. Te explica no solo la historia de los angeles sino como estar en contacto con el o los tuyos
2,Falsa Doctrina,"Este libro es un conjunto del Cristianismo, Catolicismo y el Espiritismo. El Capítulo 12 habla sobre las maneras de contactar ""guias espirituales"" por medio de las tablas de escritura espiritista, las Ouijas, Mesas que ladean, etc.No debemos dejarnos engañar. Por este medio se invitan espíritus de Satanas, no espíritus celestiales. Se trata de engañar al lector haciendo le ver que se hace un contacto celestial por estos medios, cuando en realidad por este medio se invitan espíritus de Satanas, demonios y angeles de las tinieblas. Satanas conoce muy bien las escrituras y las usa para confundir al pueblo de Dios. Tenemos que tener mucho cuidado a el contenido de los llamados ""libros espiruales""."
2,not what i expected,"I read Barbara mark and Trudy books, and it really make belive, feel, live with my angel. This books is quite the opposite so unreal, fake even an insult to your intelligence. Just do not buy you do not need this cheap literature. just belive"
3,Not Army Authorized,"Very nice ACU shirt/pants but not ""Army Authorized""The color is quite a bit brighter than Army-Issued so you definitely standout in formation.Great for fishing or hunting :)"
2,Definitely Not Army Standard,This is definitely not Army standard. Buyer beware if you're looking for an extra pair of ACU pants; these aren't the ones you're looking for for Army use.
3,nice pants - but confusing description,"I bought these for yard work (never been in the military - so I can't comment as to whether or not the color is too bright as mentioned in some of the other reviews). These pants seem well made and are very comfortable with lots of pockets for storage. One thing to make note of - the picture in the description shows that these pants have a zipper fly - but the written description says button fly. They have a button fly. They have an adjustable drawstring waist - but for the life of me I can't figure out how the drawstring waist works - and I've had plenty of pants with drawstring waists before. Maybe this is something they teach you in basic training :-) If anyone can explain it to me I would appreciate it.Overall, nice comfortable pants for doing yard work."
3,Hey wait a second?!?,"I just calculated the amount money I have already paid for this season of Pawn Stars and I won't buy another episode. The show is good but my rating is affected by Amazon. Amazon has to offer a season pass for all shows, especially like those on the History Channel that have 50 episodes a season. I'm a good customer, give me a deal here?!?!?"
1,A Disappointment at best,"Even the Crayola-bright illustrations aren't enough to redeem this book. In fact, the Crayola colors used should have been a clue to me that what's inside is far from geared towards getting ""your eBay business started right away...""In this 2009 Second Edition, one would hope for current information. Not so. As an example, this book touts Registered eBay Drop Off Locations (REDOL). While it's true, there are some REDOLS left, most fell by the wayside by 2007. The overhead of a REDOL is simply too expensive to have been a viable option.The greatest problem with this manual is it's lack of meaningful, meaty help. Simply, the manual points you in the general direction of websites. And, unfortunately, several of the links touted are broken.I'd hoped for more. Instead, I purchased a manual that's directed towards an individual who reads at an elementary school level. I purchased a manual with no solid ""how to.""I give this manual 1 star. The manual is a nice size."
2,"A pic is worth a 1000 words, but 1000 pics????","Although the book contained several pearls of wisdom invaluable to the eBay seller, the format completely detracted from the content. The authors' intention of providing screen captures and step by step instructions to assist in illustrating the ""how to's"" they were teaching were completely lost on me. I attempted to read the text content page by page, but was constantly interrupted by multi colored ""Tips"" and ""How To's"" as well as the screen shots. Overall it was incredibly distracting and difficult to read. (Despite the fact that there was much helpful information to be gleaned from the book.) Takes way to much time to gather the important facts from a book of this format."
3,"""WHERE MANKIND FAILS"" Is Formula Fun","Steel Attack is another in the long line of power metal bands popping up throughout Europe. Their debut album entitled ""WHERE MANKIND FAILS"" has just been released on July 11, 2000. Earlier that very day I just found out about the band and the album and decided to go and pick it up that night. Indeed, ""WHERE MANKIND FAILS"" is predominantly a formula power metal album. Having said that, it is also a highly enjoyable and melodic disc with some songs that are just so damn catchy, you'll find yourself singing them under your breath out of nowhere. The initial three tracks are probably the best, with track 3 (""Island Of Gods"") being THE highlight of the album, but every song is enjoyable in a generic sort of way. Fans of Hammerfall and Nocturnal Rites should REALLY enjoy this album and brand new band!"
2,"could have been good,if it werent for the vocals.,","Great guitars,fast,virtuous,with a Gamma Ray feel,good overal instrumental work ,could have been a great album,BUT the one little thing that completely lays this cd to the waste is the absolutely horrid vocals., the ""pseudo"" singer is a half-rap half-trash hibrid,that has no place here at all.. Don't buy this...unless you intend to remaster it and eliminate the vocals on it,."
1,Unstable & Rusty,"When my package first arrived I was immediately happy due to weight of the box because I was looking for a heavy duty planter. Upon opening the box I was no longer pleased. If only the rest of the planter was close to the quality of the wrought iron top piece. The stand legs are constructed of very thin, cheap, and hollow metal and had several lightly rusted areas. Where the stand meets the ground are these cheap plastic pads ( barely visible on product image ) that were not level resulting in the stand rocking. I have been looking for a well made heavy duty plant stand for under $40 for more than a year now. The search continues."
3,Koto remixed,"A word of warning: Koto is an instrumental artist who produces excellent Hi NRg dance tracks, somewhat in the style of Euro-techno group Laserdance, but in fact this CD is an album of Koto's most famous tracks, RE-RECORDED by Laserdance! Hence, it is not really a Greatest Hits CD of Koto. This is unfortunate because the original beefy sounding beat of the tracks has been lost and they now have the rather tinny and amaemic sound of other Laserdance instrumental albums. Koto's own versions are better, so why change them? An un-remixed greatest hits Cd of Koto would have got 5 stars..."
1,poor copy of the orignal,If you are looking for the lite hearted symth music koto is famous for this isn't it although I like most things on the ZYX label this is a nook off and takes away all the fun stuff most of the singles where a hit for. save your money and buy a kay tel record
3,Where's the musical score WITHOUT dialogue?,"When I first watched this movie as a child, I was completely mesmerized by the musical score (as well as by the film itself). I, too, have sought the uncut music soundtrack (without dialogue) for decades: to no avail. I finally gave up and simply downloaded the film to my iPod, then recorded as much of the music (sans dialogue) to a CD. If someone--anyone--has any info about how to gain access to the uncut musical score (without dialogue), please post it. Thank you."
2,"NOT the original sound track recording to ""The Night of the Hunter""","This was released around the time of the film release. It has Laughton narrating portions of the novel over the musical soundtrack to the film.Unfortunatly, it's NOT just the music to the film. Does the original soundtrack of the music exist out there somewhere?? Maybe in a recording studio, or in some vault? or is it lost. such beautiful music. & that off-screen lullaby...what a voice....."
5,Fantasic user-friendly book,"Mr. Skinner's book is the most practical book I have found on the subject of Decision Analysis. His writing style and examples present complex topics and techniques in an easy to understand manner. This book has provided me with very valuable examples and stories that I use daily in my work. I have many books on this subject, but this is the only book I recommend to co-workers and anyone interested in decision analysis. I especially like the way he has incorporated his web site into the book."
5,Your first and permanent reference text on decision-making,David offers us an accessible yet amazingly complete and practical book on decision-making. The presentation is very clear and understandable. The contents are relevant to real business situations. The examples are easy to translate to your real life. This is your first introduction and permanent reference to decision analysis. A bible for decision-analysts as well as decision-makers.
3,A good introduction,"Skinner presents the tools and applications of decision analysis very clearly. He supplements this with numerous case studies that aid in understanding how to apply these techniques.This is an introductory text. I believe that the author merely intended to present these techniques. No discussion of their limitations is made. The examples given are very simple, which is very helpful to explain the concepts described in the book. They cannot be expected to address all the issues in a real-life decision problem."
5,AWESOME SHOES!!!,exactly what I wanted! Perfect fit! exactly as pictured! Love the shoes! would recommend to all my friends!
5,DUH! Its Chumbawamba,Think about it people I havent heard it but dont be stupid. No offence first reviewer
1,Bootleg copy?,"Do not get me wrong...I absolutely love this show. The picture quality of these DVDs are great. The problem is the shows are completely OUT OF ORDER! There is no menu...the shows play in a loop. I checked on Animal Planet website and the box for the second season is BROWN...while the ""box"" for this set is blue. The set from Animal Planet has three disks...while this one has four. Between each episode the Animal Planet On Demand shows up which tells me that someone copied these to their DVR and burned them to DVD and sold them...of course I could be wrong, but the discs are purple like the Memorex DVD/RWs that anyone can buy at Wal-Mart. I've ordered this season from Animal Planet...we shall see...........Besides the first season has menu options, and they don't look like they are DVD/RW's."
3,Meekat Manor out of sync,The DVD is not in the correct order so it was hard to watch. My son had to make a cheat sheet so that the rest of the family can watch it in the correct order. Too bad since the program is the greatest!
5,Meercat Manor,The four seasons of the Meercat Manor series is an adventure in learning and sensitivity training. These amazing mammals touch the heart as we are privy to their trials and tribulations in everyday life.Any learning about the Kalahari desert will never be the same since it is now infused with the lives of these courageous little animals.A series for all age groupsMeerkat Manor The Complete 1st Season (4 DVD set).
4,Great for the price,"This was the first proper digital camera I've bought. I fell in love with it at first, but as I learned more about cameras and wanted to do more things, I noticed its shortcomings.It's a very nice camera for the price, but there a couple cons that really got me:- The autofocus gets confused. While trying to focus, it sometimes gets in focus but then changes and locks in blurry (especially when trying to take close-ups).- While it has a couple things you can set manually, it really doesn't have enough. (Especially with the dodgy AF.) I'd recommend going to a store and trying all the settings before buying it."
1,Blur pictures in low light and full zoom,"You like the LCD size and res. , It uses SD which is great, but a camera is judged based on its picture quality according to its features, every camera is good in good light and low zoom (like up to 4X) but this one fails to perform at its 10X zoom unless a tripod is used.I would not recommend it, currently there are a number of good zoom cameras with added features to compensate for long zoom, hand shake and low light conditions."
1,"Unreliable, expensive, garbage",This camera developed an autofocus problem during warranty and was fixed. The same problem developed out of warranty and the repair was quoted at $175. Total garbage. I'll never buy Kodak again.
4,"Great Camera, Horrible Software","Great camera, nice large screen, great resolution and color.Worst Software. I would not recommend this camera based solely on the software. But hardware of the camera is good quality and long lasting. awesome zoom lens."
5,Great Camera,"Bought this camera a month ago, and it is definately one of the best digital cameras, especially for its price. The quality of the pictures that this camera takes really pushes the limit of a 4 megapixel camera, and takes analog quality pictures."
2,2004 regrets,"Buying this camera has taught me a very valuable lesson...NEVER buy an expensive camera unless you have used a friend's in a few different conditions! I am hugely disappointed with this camera. Unless you are in bright light and not using the zoom, it is virtually impossible to get a crisply in focus best resolution shot. Although I love the feel of the thing and the large view screen, I would not recommend it to anyone."
1,Back to the store with this one!,"The ad sounded great. The viewer screen is sharp bright but the focus was the worst I have ever sceen. On a standard landscape shot with auto, it too 10-15 seconds to be ready. When trying Close-ups it never went green(Ready). I took the camera to a high end camera shop to see if I was doing something wrong. They said was the camera and they won't even sell the DX6490. Back to my Canon and Fuji."
1,The worst digital camera I have ever owened for this price,"I had lots of problem with this digital camera. I am not new to digital camera so looks like I am not doing anything wrong. I owned my older kodak camera for about 4 years and that is much better than this one. Mainly the indoor picture quality is the worst. I called Kodak support and the answer was ""that is the quality"" that is it !! If you want little camera for the worth of the price $400, try something else"
3,Better outdoors than indoors.,"I've had this camera for 2 years this Christmas. Overall, for the price it is pretty descent. The biggest problem I have with it is that indoor pictures are always grayish, unless in a super bright area, with like flouresent lights!Outdoor pictures are great. To sum it up, great for beginners, and very well lit outdoor settings."
4,great camera for a point and shoot,"This camera is a very good camera for what it is. I have taken some great shots that have made excellent 8 x 10'S. The fact that it has the capability to use an external flash really helped with night time action shots. I shoot football and racing and it has worked for both. The only complaint with the racing photography was there is some shutter delay but if you pan with the subject it does a decent job. If you learn to use the manual modes on the camera you can adapted to most photography situations. I pushed this camera to its limits for over 7,000 shots and videos combine. The video mode is nice and does a decent job. As far as durability it is great I have droped it, subjected it to intense amounts of dust and dirt, and temperature changes and it has held up great. Although the battery does tend to drian faster in colder temperatures. Overall for a point and shoot it is very adaptable and can shoot in various conditions."
4,Great camera,"very good camera, nice amount of features, the night mode could have been better,pictures show a high amount of detail even when using the optical zoom. The ability to choose color settings and the large display were greatly appreciated. Most ppl rated the camera lower than it deserves cause of the software it comes with but what they should realise is that use of the software is optional you can always use other programs to obtain your pics from the camera."
1,"Great camera, no charger.","I am 100% pleased with this camera, deffinately meets my expectations and more, the only problem is, when ordering it from gfas_care, it came in a ziplock bag, with a bent up User's Guide and NO CHARGER. WHAT A RIP OFF! I am satisfied with my camera, not satisfied with the seller. I would never purchase an item from them again."
5,Beeb Birtles Sounds Great,"As one of the Founding members of The Little River band (LRB) and Now ""Birtles Shorrock & Goble"". Beeb Birtles song writing credentials can not be questioned , this CD is an extention of LRB , The songs have great words and meaning. !! I think if it was with a major label it would have done better, Beeb Birtles is now in Birtles Shorrock and Goble and he has them Play some of the songs from Driven by dreams . Its all Good!!Why not Purchase the Full Circle DVD from Birtles Shorrock Goble you will love it!"
1,a lousy clock,"Only a week or two after I bought this clock, it slowed down considerably and made me miss an appointment. I gave it new batteries, and tried resetting it to the correct time on several occasions, but each time the clock once again slowed down. Obviously defective, not worth the return shipping costs."
1,1 out of 3 Ain't Bad?,"I purchased 2 of these because the design is good and I needed the backlit face. When just outside of the 30 day return policy, the alarm stopped working on one of them.I ordered another to replace that one and now, just outside of 30 days, again a malfunction of the 3rd one. Don't bother with this product. Spend a little more andget a good clock."
2,"Nice to have all the tools together in one box, but......","I just received this tool-set yesterday so I can't really comment through use of the tools. But upon inspection, the different tools appear very poorly made - example: the ratchet tool feels like it is going to fall apart as you twist the head to change the direction from left to right, and the flashlight is light as a feather.Given that, having these tools together in one portable place is nice. Plus I guess you shouldn't really expect much more for the price. Don't get me wrong, I still plan on keeping this in the back of my truck. But if I were to do it again, I might spend a little more money, and put an emergency tool-box together myself."
4,My opinion of Good-bye Mr. Chips,"Good-bye Mr. Chips was a good book for short, recreational reading.Mr. Chips is an elderly man who tells about his life as a school teacher.He also tells all about his wife, whom he loved very much, but whom died an early death.Through out the book the stories of the past are told by Mr. Chips as he sits in his chair drinking tea. He is very kind andhe loves the boys at the school."
2,Sadly disappointing,"I had hoped for very good things from this book, but the good things are just too thin, such as they are, and too far between. Chips has a narrow world-view and is completely out of touch with most everything. He is married briefly and his wife dies. He retires in 1913 but cannot bear to move away from the boys school where he has taught so many years. His life seems to be taken up by staring across at the school and reading detective novels. It is hardly enough to sustain a reader's interest.During the World War he returns to the school temporarily, while the faculty is thinned out by army recruitment. During all this, he seems almost proud of his ignorance in such things as movies, popular music, etc. The only part I found interesting was Chips' tribute to a former teacher who taught German at the school, the man having been killed in the German army.Hilton also wrote several short stories featuring Mr. Chips, but they are no better."
1,sentimental drivel,The real problem with this book is that there is no substance to it. I wouldn't even call it fluff because there is no fluff to it either. There's nothing to this book at all.
1,I shouldn't even give the book that much credit!,"Mr. Chips was such a bore! The timezones are all mixed up, ad Mr. Chips' life is all mixed up between the chapters. I had to read it for a report in 8th grade! IEIEIEIEI! AWFUL! Mr. Chips dies at the end of the book with no point, don't read this book. Maybe I should have given it a quarter of a star"
1,The biggest waist of 3 minutes I ever spent,"If you start reading this book and it feels like your reading nothing, well your probably already finished reading it. This book is so short that it has no room for detail or quality. If your in homeroom and just remembered that you have to have a book read by next period, just whip out Good-Bye Mr. Chips. While the story is short, you will be reading a bunch of sentences full of dull, who gives a horses battoot storries from an old guieser with a dream to be a cool teacher (Yeah right) and crack quick jokes and tell cool storries. Yahh, go Mr. Chips go, Your my Favorite teacher, heres an apple."
4,Gentle Story,"It's the gentle story of a man who taught in a British private boys' school for many decades. I love the way Chips starts out as a very average sort of person and teacher. It's the experiences of life---the death of his wonderful wife, the tragedies of the war, the days, years spent teaching children---that transform Chips into a thoughtful, clever, and exemplary human being."
4,"A Must-Read for all Teachers: Past, Present, and Future.","I'm a junior in high school and considered giving up hoping to be a teacher because of the constantly changing politics behind it, but this book showed me that teaching isn't out of the question. I learned that as long as you love what you do and continue to do what works well for you, you will succeed. Mr. Chips was a kind, but firm person and had a great influence on his students. My mother is also a teacher and I recommended the book to her. All teachers should read this at least once. It makes a wonderful profession that much better.My only complaint is that the novel seemed rushed and too short for me (I read it from start to finish in two hours), so it seemed more like a novella."
4,An easy to read Classic,"Still waiting for the DVD (the movie starring Peter O' Toole was a true masterpiece), I have been surprised by this enchanting book. It's obviousily ""out of time"" if you analize the told story, but of course each and every teacher outhere, sometimes feels she or he could be in some way like the old mr. Chips."
3,A Decent Book,This is a classic portrait of an element of British society and their admiration for a man. It is a short work that is easy to work though and is certainly appropriate for a younger audience. I remain attached to many of the mentors who helped me navigate my younger years so appreciate this work even today.
5,Amazingly Good,"I have to admit that I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this novel. I bought it when it was required reading for a class in college, and managed to get through the class without reading it. I have since picked it up and read it cover to cover. I was not dissapointed as I had originally thought I would be.This is a charming tale. A little bit of romance, a lot of adventure, and an unforgettable tale. I really would recomend this novel to anyone who enjoys reading as they would be pleasantly surprised."
3,"Good story, bad edition","Prisoner Of Zenda is a wonderful story, reviewed by others in this format. My comments relate specifically to the Lake Illustrated Classics edition. It is more a graphic novel than an illustrated book. Furthermore, it is abridged, cutting out, for example, most of the coronation scene. Obviously it was designed for children, and would be good to interest them in the story."
3,A nice entertainer,The book is a mish mash of characters from the late Victorian era. The book is delightfully entertaining although tends to get languid especially in the middle. The plot and the schemes remind you of the master of these genre of novels - Alexander Dumas. A nice entertainer on a Sunday afternoon
5,A great pair of books,"At some point in their lives everyone wishes they could trade places with someone famous. And if you happen to look like royalty, so much the better. Rudolf Rassendyll quickly discovers what it's like to be king, and it's a lot more dangerous than he thought... The plot is summarized elsewhere so suffice it to say you'll find all the elements of a great swashbuckler in these pages: intrigue, romance, a charming rogue and of course a cunning enemy. Paired with the harder to find Rupert of Hentzau (not as good, but still worth it... a closure issue...) make this a fun read anytime. There's a reason this book has been in print for more than a century, there's a reason nine movies have been made about it.. IT'S THAT GOOD!"
4,An excellent adventure,"A rolicking good read, with a hero who is far from perfect and seems to tumble into the adventure willy-nilly.Honour and high morality are key, though the hero and his well-meaning side-kicks seem to fall from both. There is a lovely love interest for our star-crossed hero, drinking and riding and fighting and a nice strong plot. Some of the secondary characters are a little flat and two-dimensional, but the ones we care about are nicely delineated.The language is lovely and, in the digital version I read, without any of the ebook glitches and typos that can so annoy and diminish a reading experience."
3,Poor Audio Quality Hurts A Classic Story,"""The Prisoner of Zenda"" has been in constant print since it was first published in 1896. It has served as the basis for numerous films, television shows, plays and radio dramas. It is about as an iconic adventure story as has ever been written. Unfortunately, Blackstone Audio has not done a good job of bringing this classic text to Audio CD. The quality of the sound recording is very poor. The sound quality reminds me of what one hears when their head is under water. Furthermore, while the narrator is a skilled voice actor, he is much too old for the part of the vigorous and youthful Rudolf Rassendyl. I see that Naxos is releasing another Audio CD of this book in June 2010. I have not heard it but it has to be better than the Blackstone recording."
3,"Very good, but ""The Knee Crisis Handbook"" is better...","I bought this & ""The Knee Crisis Handbook"" by Dr Brian Halpern. ""The Knee Crisis Handbook"" is better. Both cover knee surgery and sports, but Dr Halpern's has a whole exercise plan for your knees - stretching, ""quickie"" workout, ACL workout, general knee health, etc. Dr. Halpern is also more realistic about living with your 'bad' knee(s). For example, Dr. Halpern discusses how to protect your knees when playing football, etc. Whereas Dr Scott just tells you not to do 'em. Dr. Halpern's was also more personal - many patient interviews included. Helps you to get a feel for what you can & can't do with your knees. And Dr. Halpern's book seemed more informative & detailed without being boring or long. Wish I'd had this when I first injured my knee in college nearly 20 yrs ago. But better late than never."
4,A good as u can expect from a camera bag like this,"Well its a sharp looking camera bag with a lengthy shoulder strap included. There is a lifetime warranty on the seams. And it fits my Nikon coolpix 950 with a little room to spare.The front pouch can hold about the volume of 1 1/2 packs of king size (american standard size) cigarretes. The bag is well constructed and feels quite sturdy. It has two mesh pockets on the side that can hold a roll of film each. All in all the bag can expand nicely to accomodate alot of crap, as well as ur camera."
3,Big house serenade,"THE COLLECTION is a series of CDs issued by DEJAVU, an Austrian label. These packages come with no performer notes.Many of the songs on THE LEADBELLY COLLECTION were covered by folk and rock artists decades later. For example, ""Gallis Pole"" was done by both Led Zeppelin and Peter, Paul & Mary. PPM also crafted versions of ""There Is A Man Going Around,"" ""Stewball"" and ""We Shall Be Free."" The Weavers popularized ""Good Night Irene,"" and ""John Hardy"" was a staple for the Carter Family and others.The Leadbelly sides in this set are simply orchestrated: generally just his voice and guitar, with occasional harmonica or squeezebox backup. Source material quality is variable, with no tracks being necessarily poor or excellent-- all have either some surface imperfections or tinniness, or both. Output levels tend to be a bit low. The music itself reflects the man's experiences. Much here is raw Depression-era prison yard holler.TOTAL RUNNING TIME -- 37:43"
5,Extremely Rich!!,"This is a book to savor. This is a book to read devotionally, slowly and contemplatively. Spurgeon is a man from another era who has spent time at the feet of our Lord Jesus and who's ability to communicate the intimate love and riches he has found there is inspiring. I highly recommend this book for Christians of this generation, young and old!!"
5,Very helpful book for mental health professionals,"This book is very useful for mental health professionals. Even if you're not doing sucide assessment, per se, it's good to know what questions to ask, and how to ask them, of ALL clients!The book is very well organized and well written. Although I've only read about half of it, I think I've learned a lot, and am looking forward to reading it to the end."
2,Wish I would have know that this is just a BOOK REVIEW,"The article gave a helpful summary of the book that it reviews. However, I found it misleading in a way that Amazon.com did not specifically list this article as a book review. I did not like spending $[...] on an article that I could have found by other means or actually paging through the book that this article reviews."
2,This series is getting old now,"Just finished reading this novel this morning and I think it is probably the weakest one of the lot. Like a lot of reviewers, I didn't find this one anywhere near as gripping or well-developed plotwise as a number of the earlier ones in the Stephanie Plum series. As well, the supposed sexual tension- love triangle between Stephanie, Joe and Ranger is approaching its use-by date. It is definitely becoming boring and I think Ms Evanovich needs to resolve Stephanie's romantic situation once and for all. I still enjoy characters like Lula and Grandma Mazur but a lot of the situations Stephanie found herself in fell flat with me. There are only so many times she can have her car blown up, handbag destroyed, apartment broken into, etc, before it becomes tiresome and repetitive. I still think there is a spark of life in the Stephanie Plum series, but I hope the next novel is a better effort and not so much by-the-numbers as this one."
5,Loved this book!,I have read all of Janet Evanovich's books and this one was by far the funniest. The story line was interesting and had a nice fast pace. Several of the incidents had me laughing out loud. I usually read a couple of pages before bed but this book had me staying up past my bedtime!
4,A Solid Read,"I have to confess that I was getting tired of every car blowing up and Stephanie acting so silly that even I couldn't beleive it. I was considering losing hope on the series.I had to read this one, though, just to see if it would continue. I was pleasantly surprised to find a more thought out book, a good story line, and that the characters had grown a bit.I do read this for the humour and I'd hate to lose most of the antics in it but I did want to see some growth because after all, they are grownups.I find ""Eleven on Top"" with a curious mystery, great story line, good tension between Steph, Ranger and Joe, and all the characters we know and love back in full force and doing what they can to entertain us.I won't give up yet because this one makes me want to continue the journey to see where we all end up.I'd say if you were on the edge of considering this one, I would surely give it a try. I think it's moving ahead and back to what we read the series for."
3,Worth waiting for....at the library,"If you're a Stephanie Plum fan, you, of course, will have to read this book. If you are new to the series, this book is not the one to start with. Only a dedicated fan will be able to get through ""Eleven on Top."" It has the usual descriptive eating disorders (both Stephanie's and Bob's), the predictable car explosions (enough already!) and continued conflict between Morelli and Ranger (ok, maybe Ranger wins this round...but did Evanovich have to turn Morelli into such a wimp?). Stephanie is a great character, but I would really like to see her grow a bit...and get a little smarter after 11 books. She knows Ranger will come to save her regardless of how stupid she acts. If you want a good read, go get one of the earlier books and wait for ""Eleven on Top"" to show up at your local library."
3,Eating/Drinking problems do not add,"I'm a big fan of Janet Evanovich, especially with this particular Stephanie Plum Bounty Hunter mystery series. However, I fail to understand why this time around, Evanovich has to give some of the female characters eating and drinking problems. This does not add in any way whatsoever to the book. Shouldn't being called a ""fat *ss"" reason enough to want to lose weight, or just being tired of the same old unhealthy routine? Or why can't Stephanie enjoy her cake in peace? Portraying women as complete dim wits with absolute zero self control in order to add interest or an element of entertainment is not only demeaning, it doesn't work and it surely ain't funny. Women are smarter than that, even the ones from New Jersey.An alright book if you want to catch up on Stephanie Plum. Entertainmentwise, it barely passes."
3,"2 stars according to my criteria, but 4 for ""adherence to formula""","Janet Evanovich seems to have identified a formula that works for her Stephanie Plum series: Stephanie is loveable but inept, cannot seem to escape either her family or the trials of her career as a bounty hunter, is torn between two lovers, and relishes eating with abandon.If you think about it, what woman can't identify with her?There is no additional plot- or character-development in this 11th installment. As a reader, I personally find that disappointing (hence the two stars) but suspect that most of Evanovich's target audience enjoys settling in with Stephanie like they enjoy putting on a comfortable pair of sweats and fixing an ice cream sundae to enjoy. So that results in a 4 star rating for Evanovich's adherence to a winning formula."
3,Somewhat Disappointed,"I am a huge Evanovich fan and have read the Plum series numerous times, but I agree with others that it's time to wrap this series up. Everything is predictable and has gotten old. This series has gone on two books too long, in my opinion. I'll keep reading the books, but think I'll get them from the library instead."
2,Time to lay this story to rest . . .,"It's all been said ~ it's all been done ~ in triplicate!!! These are very entertaining and enjoyable characters, but the stories are in a loop and keep recycling themselves. I paid a LOT more for this installment (I had hopes it might be an improvement over #10) than all the others and it was THE SAME STORY!!! Let's get Stephanie married off to SOMEBODY, stop the silly shenanigans and move on."
4,Just plain fun.,"I don't read these expecting depth or character growth. I read them for what they are--always fun, a bit silly at times but they make me laugh. And that's not a bad thing."
3,"Still funny, but starting to get old","Janet Evanovich still manages to come up with some laugh-out-loud moments in her latest Stephanie Plum Novel ""Eleven on Top"", but the novelty is starting to wear off. Stephanie may have tried to move on from bounty hunting, but is essentially in exactly the same place in her life. At some point, she needs to move on -- get married and have to deal with in-laws, have kids and deal with diapers --something to make continuing the series worth it. Otherwise its the same thing, different day.All in all, the Stephanie Plum series is still supremely better than Evanovich's Metro Girl series."
3,Losing some brightness...,"I too have been a fan from the beginning but this is the first book I have not bought. There are many laughs but the situations are getting repetitive. And there are too many useless characters that need to move on. Sister Valerie, her now 3 kids, & her fiance (or maybe he is her husband now) are good examples. I would have liked Ranger to remain a man of mystery. I liked it better before Stephanie found out where he lived and I now know too much about his family. And I agree that her antics make Joe Morelli look like a wimp for staying with her.I was looking forward to this book but can say that the anticipation for the next one is not as strong. I'm thinking Janet is thinking the checks are coming in so why bother with anything new?"
1,DULLER THAN A 10-YEAR-OLD PAINT JOB,"Evanovich now churns out books with about as much imagination as McDonalds pushes out hamburgers.Her books are so formulaic that only a reader with amnesia would not feel like each one is an exercise in deja vu.Evanovich puts Plum, Morelli, et al, through all the familiar paces--even the characters seem bored with the whole charade.This isn't writing, it's typing.Evanovich is really just a marketing machine; she's really no longer a writer (if she ever really was). It would be OK if she was in it for the art and the cash--now's she clearly only in it for the cash. The books are as gimmicky as the promotions that shill them (i.e. contests to name a character in her books, etc.).The best contribution Evanovich can now make to the genre of the comic novel is to quit, or actually write one that gets a genuine laugh for a change."
1,BORING! BORING! BORING! BORING!,"I can't even believe how incredibly dull this one was! I loved 1 - 9, 10 was a little iffy, but 11 was awful! Stephanie is getting dull and stupid, I can't stand Ranger any longer - can he say anything more than ""Babe""? Ever??? Lula is the only bright star in an otherwise dreary day of a book and even she got a little tiring. Just marry Morrelli, have accident prone kids, and be done with it!!!!"
3,What happened to the ending???,"I think I wrote the same review for 10 Big Ones--it's like Evanovich got tired of writing and rushed the ending. There's no wrap-up and no set-up should I decided to keep reading this series. I think this franchise has about run it's course. Getting a little too ""samey"" and stupid. And the characters I loved so much in the first few novels are becoming cliched. Okay for a fast summer read."
3,Not so on top,"This was a good sitting by the pool book. The tension between Joe, Ranger and Stephanie had me miss one of my kids leave the baby pool area! However, it was mostly a romance novel. The suspense was lacking. The crime aspect of the book felt like an afterthought. Like, oh yeah, let's add someone trying to kil Stephanie! It gets three stars because the whole book felt rushed. Like someone else wrote, it felt like a page was missing, but I felt like that in more than one place. Don't get me wrong though-a great easy fun summer read!"
2,Requires character development.,"I have read or listened to all of the Stephanie Plum books. I used to enjoy them, but this series is no longer novel. The formula has worn out [Stephanie can't choose between Ranger and Morrelli and is terrible as a bounty hunter. Lula still wears 'ho clothes...so what else is new?].I was very disappointed with this book and quite frankly have lost the desire to read any more of Ms. Evanovich's works.How about writing a story about Mr. Kloughn? He is hilarious. It could be called ""Klouning Around."""
2,Stephanie Plum Ran out of gas a long time ago,"Sorry all you Stephanie Plum lovers. The series was great until a couple of volumes ago. Then the stories began to sound weak and boring. This one is no different than #10: and that one was a stinker.I got the feeling that Janet Evanovich was now just in it for the money and had no fresh ideas. She was probably washing the dishes and writing something at the same time, or had someone feeding her bad storyline. I wish authors with her original flair for charactors would know when to give it up. That is not the case with this one. Spend your money on a better book.I hope you don't think that I am sour grapes. I used to thoroughly enjoy her books. #6 had me luaghing so hard at a coffee store In Buenos Aires that coffee started to come through my nose.The italians say ""there is no worst thief, than reading a bad book"". That is sure the case with this one"
4,4 1/2 stars,This is only the second Stephanie Plum audio I've listened to.After listening to the previous one I knew that if I ever saw another available (on the library shelf) I would listen to it. Hilarious and well read. Lorelei King's reading is a pure pleasure to listen to. It makes the commute to work enjoyable.Highly recommended.
5,Back on Top,"I was nervous after book nine left me disappointed. Ten proved to be worthy and eleven has (at least in my book) Janet Evonovich back on top. What a wonderful entertaining story loaded with the best of stephanies eccentric friends and family. Lots of Ranger (which never hurts), and some interesting changes making it hard to wait for the number twelve. What else could you ask for?"
3,eleven only half way there,"While entertaining, I did not find myself laughing out loud as in some of past books in the series. It did create smiles though. Was worth the time to read, but the subject of Stephanie Plum is starting to age. Basically same stuff, different day."
3,Was something missing?,"I love the Plum series, usually. Was something missing from my book? It seemed to just end, without any explanation."
3,It is all for fun,"It is the characters that make this series worth reading. Yes, the mystery part is not great, the plot lines are thin but that is not what makes these best sellers. It is the laugh out loud characters that bring me back each time. This one is pure chacterzation, just like a quick visit with old friends. Maybe not the reason to write a book or read a book but I appreciated the light visist at this holiday season."
2,disappointed,I didn't make it all the way through the book - Ten was hard and I was disappointed in it too. Lula has gotten irritating - it's all about eat eat eat. Steph still doesn't carry a gun - you would only have to shoot at me once and I would learn to carry a gun! I am from a super small town so I can relate to the speed of gossip so that part isn't as bad. Morelli needs to get his head out of the sand! It's getting more and more like it's the Three Stooges get jobs as bounty hunters!
4,fun,"frivolous and fun to read. same characters and story line, buy some laugh out loud moments keep you going. light hearted."
2,Basically disappointed,I have read every book in the Stephanie Plumb series. I look forward to them coming out! This one was just not as great as the rest. It was a let down. Kind of boring.
2,ELEVEN ON TOP,STEPHANIE PLUM IS DONE. THAT WAS MY LAST STEPHANIE PLUM BOOK I WILL PURCHASE. I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THE BOOK AND WOULD RECOMMENT THAT YOU REREAD ANYONE OF THE OTHER BOOKS.
4,Stephanie does it again and again and again,This series is such fun. Stephanie Plum continues to be a sassy and fearless bounty hunter. I love reading of her adventures between books that are deeper and more emotionally draining. I never tire of her wit and the quirkiness of her family.
4,Eleven On Top,"What I like about Janet Evanovich novels is how easy it is to live along with the characters. Stephanie Plum is a woman, who has issues, some she faces and some she lets slide. She has low self esteem, but carries on and meets the problem full force, and then is surprised when it's solved.Eleven On Top is full of exciting, dangerous fun. A little romance thrown in,and funny moments that made me laugh out loud."
3,You know what to expect by now,"I'm assuming you've read the previous 10 Janet Evanovich novels to get to this point. You laugh at Stephaine Plum and her love interests as she, the most unlikely bondsman, solves her cases. Yeah, yeah, it's funny and I like the characters. The problem is that it's like all her others. You know what to expect and she delivers, but it feels like its all been done before. I don't know if I'm going to keep reading them. I would like to see it turned into a series -- maybe on HBO. Now that might be interesting."
3,just ok,"after diving into the first 10 i could not wait for this to come out! a big disappointment. slow plotline, week sexual tension, NOT very many laugh out loud funny parts at all. another reviewer was right. . .the weekest of the bunch. 12 got a bit better, but it is still not back to the awesome-ness of the previous 10. (the pack of horny dogs in 10 i think tops the list as the most funny part in any of them!)"
4,A very informative book...,"... in which we learn:* That Stepahnie Plum's crazy life is not dependent on her being a bounty hunter.* That when you've dealt with crazy scumbags for long enough, anonymous death threats are less important than getting to dinner on time* That a lack of donuts turns normal women into nymphomaniacs* That Disneyworld is a perfectly acceptable alternative to a wedding* That when arresting a criminal it's best not to let yourself be seduced and handcuffed to his headboard, lest he run away with your clothesand much more. There's not much to say here- this is another Stephanie Plum book. If you liked the previous ones, you'll like this one as well. If you didn't like the previous ones, why would you read another one? But chances are you did like the previous ones because like this one they are well written funny, and full of outrageous characters."
2,Time to modify the formula,"I've read all of the books in the Stephanie Plum series. I love Ms. Evanovich's humorous style of writing, but am beginning to tire of the Steffy Plum formula. It's been repackaged and retold eleven times now. Nothing new, nothing different in this book. Where I once ""felt"" for Stephanie, as she tried to choose between Ranger and Morelli, I now find her slutty and manipulative. I now feel pity for handsome babe-magnet Morelli and that's wrong. It's time for him to have a new long-term girlfriend for a while. Readers would enjoy seeing how Stephanie would react to that. Ranger seems to regard Steffy as an amusement; let him stay that way. Keep all of the nutty folks in though. They're what keep me reading. Standouts inlcude Lula, Grandma Mazur, Bella and Steph's mom. No one can match Ms. Evanovich's humor!"
2,"All about the romance, No real mystery","The Stephanie Plum series is all about the romance. The relationship aspects of the series are the parts that the author plans out two to three books ahead of time. The rest of the story follows where she wants to take the relationships book to book. Sounds like more of a romantic comedy than a mystery series. The author will keep rolling out these books and her fans will keep eating them up. Why mess with a winning formula? I used to wish that the author would take this series further, stretch her creativity and talent and bring back some of the freshness that made the Stephanie Plum novels and characters so original. But I haven't seen anything new for at least half the series and now don't expect anything but more of the same each time I read. They're still entertaining but no longer exciting. Too bad. It used to be such a sassy series. Now it seems more lazy then anything else."
4,Eleven On Top,"Evanovich is back is a big way. It's laugh out loud, sexy entertainment. The witty banter, the tension between Stephanie, Ranger and Joe, it's a must read."
2,Different Author,"There's just no way that this installment was written by the same author that wrote one through about eight. Although the main characters have the same names as previous efforts, they are bad cardboard versions, especially Ranger; the constant use of the word, ""Babe"" in every sentence attributed to him was jarring and just bad writing, totally out of character.I suspect that this installment was written by Ms. Evanovich's editor, to whom the book is dedicated ""for all her efforts"". A sad and irritating end to what was a joyful series."
3,Eleven NOT on Top,"I love the Stephanie Plum series and waited patiently for Eleven on Top to come out. I thought Ten Big Ones was the best book yet. I had high hopes for Eleven on Top. I even pre-ordered it from Amazon and had friends waiting in line to read my copy when it arrived. Very ho-hum, I kept waiting for the story to really get going, I was still waiting whent the book ended. Can't Morelli get hit by a bus or something so we can get more of the man of mystery? How 'bout some realism like the men lose interest for 5 minutes and Stephanie has to TRY. All of the other books have some really exciting part, this one just seemed like all of the other books spliced together to form a new much less interesting story. I'm waiting with high hopes for TWELVE, I hope it measures up to the others."
3,An okay read,"As a huge Plum fan I have read all 10 of the previous books. This book left me feeling a little bit disappointed though. Janet seems to be trying to stretch the Plum character in this book into something that seems ill fitting. The language was rougher than the previous novels and Morelli and Ranger were not nealy as involved as in previous books. There just did not seem to be the connection in this book that I felt in the others. The Plum novels are always fun and a good read however, I felt this one left me a little disconnected from Stephanie and her crazy life! Anticipating the 12th one already!"
4,Doesn't disappoint her fans,"I love the Stephanie Plum series. There is nothing like it to boost your mood or make you smile. This installment doesn't disappoint. While you could make the case that Stephanie's back and forth between Joe and Ranger is getting a little old, it is still working. Also, I like the change in employement for Stephanie; it has her using her brains."
3,Sooo disappointed,"I am usually gushing with compliments about the Plum gang, but I will have tone it down with this latest installment. I waited for it to come out and like a good dessert that you have been saving calories ( or some of us points) for, it was short on da' flava'. In this book it seems the villian is less menacing, less disturbed and really he didn't keep me interested in who or why he was stalking Miss Plum. The comedy wasn't laugh out loud, near smiles maybe??? The big reveal at the end, really didn't make sense and I felt let down. Like that big ""O"" that seems to have eluded me once again. Damn!I hope J. Evanovich will make it up to us in book twelve."
5,I love them all!,"I have read all the Stephanie Plum novels and eagerly anticipate the release of the next novel each summer. In Eleven on Top, Stephanie is back but being a bounty hunter is too dangerous so Stephanie is searching for a safer job however this is Stephanie and nothing she touchs is safe.After a failure at the button factory - Stephanie ends up working at Ranger's and living with Morelli as she is being stalked.The scenes are funny as always. There is a confrontation between Grandma Belle and Grandma Mazur at where else but the funeral home.I am now eagerly anticipated #12."
2,Sadly there is nothing new here...,"You get the same storyline as you did in the first 10 books. Ranger is still mysterious, Stephanie is still confused and Morrelli is only thinking of one thing. The characters are all still funny but they are all doing the same thing in the same place. We need Stephanie to get married, maybe move, have kids, possibly go through police academy or something. I hate to give up on the series but if it continues like this, I see no reason to keep reading."
2,"Please, Stephanie, get a clue","I have read every book in this series and really liked them all until about Hard 8. Now they are just all the same. It's time for Stephanie to grow into a new direction already. She's still stomping off to the donut shop, can't keep bullets in the gun, sleeping with one guy and lusting for the other and getting cars blown to bits. What was once funny is just now tired, predictable and rote. I find myself angry at Stephanie for being so stupid. Let's see some personal growth and new characters."
4,Tired of waiting,"I have happily devoured these books, but I'm sorry, after Number 11 I'm ready to give up. I won't buy any more of these books because I suspect Stephanie will never be allowed to make up her mind about anything. If Ms. Evanovich wants us to keep reading her terrific books, she needs to wind this story up and start something else. It's cruel to never get to the end. Goodbye and good luck."
3,More of the Same,"Maybe I've read too many of the Stephanie Plum novels but I found it hard to read ""More of the Same"". I find the stories to be so repetitive; same characters, same types of stories and just ""okay"" to read. Let's have some originality; New characters, more punch and excitement!"
3,10 For Humor 1 For Suspense,"This book is entertaining. Stephanie Plum careens from one improbable situation to the next with witty dialogue and easy-to-read narrative that makes the plot move along briskly. The characters are a little cliche-the strapping, sexy Morelli who is both lover and hero for Plum fits a certain stereotype to a T. Plum, herself, is quite engaging, and the is the kind of person who stumbles into one hilarious predicament after the other with a group of equally colorful colleagues. However, the book appears to me to center more around a diverse set of interesting characters and their relations rather than an intricate crime plot full suspense and mind bending developments. Basically, several people disappear and an unknown enemy of Plum hounds her with menacing messages. Plum, the ex bounty hunter, and Morelli and others chase this trail.The Griffon Trilogy (Pt. I)"
5,review of eleven on top...evanovich,"Evanovich has a gift for writitng in which she is able to combine drama, humor and, I suspect, a bitof her own experiences. The result is books which are in the ""can't hardly put it down"" category.She has had NO BAD BOOKS (I've only read the Plum series"") and the book under review was maybe the funniest of all and had a real twist at the end. The major writers such as Deaver and Patterson tend to ""go flat"" every so often, but Evanovich delivers every time!"
4,Good book but lacks some ooomph!!,"While I did read this book in 2 days...i didn't get the ""warm fuzzies"" I usually get when reading a Steph Plum book. Not enough Grandma Mazur for my taste."
2,she phoned this one in,"I couldn't wait for this Plum installment, and I was disappointed. I gave it 2 stars because I did laugh out loud a few times.I discovered the first Plum book and read all ten in 6 weeks! I loved them.I fear that Janet is more concerned about her empire than writing a well constructed story with multi dimensional characters. I will check out the next one and if it is equally as disappointing, I will make up my own ending and move on.In the meantime, I highly recommend The Bubbles Yablonsky series, the Amanda Pepper series, the Blackbird sisters and a new great discovery, Amanda Cooper, psychic eye."
5,Eleven ontop is surely ontop,"Janet Evanovich is a wonderful writer and she does not disapoint in this book. Although the ending does get a little wacky. Stephanie is one of the funniest characters that has ever come along. This is a very funny book, and series. Its easy fun reading. Read this book and the whole series, for a time filled with laughter and fun."
5,One of her best,"After a disappointing book 10 I was relieved that this book left me laughing. This time around Janet kept my interest in the story and of course the wonderful characters Stephanie, Joe and Ranger. How can a fictional character ooze such sex appeal. This book is a must read for this summer. No one but Stephanie can have so much happen to her."
4,Needs Development,"This book was better than the last few in the series, but it's really way past time to start developing these characters and stories more.The basic plotline remains the same -- Stephanie loves Joe, but lusts after Ranger. Her cars blow up. Her family is dysfunctional. Lula is a 'ho. As long as these characters have been around, one would expect to see at least a little development instead of the same old same old, which is starting to get stale. How many funerals can Grandma attend?The last few books have indicated in the forward that Janet Evanovich is now using a co-writer. Perhaps that's the problem with this series, because her other co-written series stinks."
2,Same old stuff,"The first 5 in Stephanie Plum series are absolutely hilarious, then it starts going downhill. I really enjoyed first five books although Stephanie was getting on my nerves with her absolute terror of guns, but it was fun reading none the less. Then, I think, Janet Evanovich was starting to run out of the ideas. The Eleven on top is boring, boring, boring. Its more of the same old stuff-Stephanie is just as incompetent as she was in the first book, her love life is just as screwed up(choose Ranger already and be done with it), and her grandmother is just as nuts. Don't waste your money."
3,"Unfortunately, this series is becoming more formulaic over time...","I read this one pretty quickly. It was good, although I have to say that the Lula jokes and Grandma Mazur jokes, though they were always my favorite, are getting just a bit old. That makes me a bit sad.In this book Stephanie is only vaguely trying to track down some missing bad guys. Mostly it's about her quitting her bounty hunter job and pursuing other careers (and, of course, hilarity ensues). Eventually she ends up working for Ranger the hot bounty hunter (in what, I must say, seems like a dream job, and not just because of Ranger's presence).Morelli, Lula, Grandma Mazur, and the rest of Stephanie's nutty family also play major roles in this book but overall the book struck me as formulaic. Too bad."
3,I hope the end is near,"The book still has some charm and humor of the previous ones in the series, but it's high time for the main plot to find some resolution. I sure hope that the 12th book will be the last one and Stephanie will swing out of her two-man conflict limbo. Nothing new is added to the story, just kind of rehashing the same old, but funny and lovable characters pull it through."
2,"I'd say ....""eleven is on the bottom""","First I want to say - I LOVE THE STEPHANIE PLUM NOVELS!!!!!!!!!!! I was crying & laughing out loud on a full commuter train ... I couldn't help myself.But, this is the first novel I felt that Janet Evanovich has lost some of the sparkle. This story felt very tired and rehashed. About halfway thru I could predict the ending and how it would end up with Joe and Ranger.I am hopeful that Janet Evanovich will take a break and be able to find her unique-ness again."
3,Getting old,"I love the Plum series. I started reading then about two years ago. I read book after book and laughed out loud. Now there doesn't seem to be anything new to laugh at. I used to love the Ranger, Joe and Stephanie triangle, now I find it frustrating. All good things need to come to an end and I think it's time for this series to wrap up."
1,Same old - Same old - Boring,"This one is worse than 10. Morelli should dump Stephanie she is such a pain, still going up and down on the same spot. Ranger and Stephanie deserve each other, she's an immature child and he is an egomaniac with big raps on himself. Janet Evanovich has also lost her touch with the humour in her books, I no longer find them funny because the situations are so repetative. I no longer buy the books, I wouldn't waster my money, I borrow them from the library. I only buy books that I feel are worth reading. It's a great pity because I really loved her early books, but unfortunately the only character that has shown any growth is Morelli. In an ongoing series characters have to grow and change otherwise they become very boring. Which is exactly what has happened with this series."
2,New material needed,"Having read all eleven of these, I can only conclude that the author needs to invent some new characters and situations to go with Stephanie Plum. How many times can I be amused by her car being destroyed? By her grandmother's antics at a funeral home ""viewing""? By the rippling muscles and puerile approaches of her two suitors? By the malaprops of her ex-hooker friend? By the hamster in his soup can? By the dysfunctional sister and her kids, one of whom thinks she is a horse? Perhaps if I had read all these with a year between each, it wouldn't be so obvious. But, alas....There is humor, I'll admit, but it gets thin when the same joke is told over and over and over."
2,"Predictable, Story Doesn't Go Anywhere...","While still entertaining, this book really has nothing to offer. Sure you can finish this in one day, becuase there is no real storyline, no plot, and no depth to any of the characters. You can skim through much of it and not miss a moment of the ""action."" I think Evanovich is just riding the success of the previous books and not bothering to put anything new, original or interesting into this story. The characters have become so unbelievable... Stephanie was once cute and endearing, but now is just an idiot. The plots are too unrealistic, even for a bumbling ""bounty hunter."" This series has more than run its course. There is no attempt to develop any storyline and venture out of the comfort zone that was created many books ago.Glad I got this one from the library, it wouldn't be worth the money. Maybe the next installment will move things along and develop a storyline?"
4,Another fun Stephanie novel,"A big fan of Stephanie Plum novels, I couldn't wait for the paperback to come out, and I was not disappointed.Stephanie's antics continue with her usual getting into jams and needing to be rescued, cars exploding, and Ms. Evanovich successfully finds ways to keep that from getting old. The Stephanie-Morelli and Stephanie-Ranger sparks continue to fly, although this reader can't help but wish she'd dump Morelli and have another Ranger fling.Another fun read. I raced right through it. Don't hesitate -- it's worth it."
5,Plum at her best!,"Stephanie Plum is back in action in true form. Someone is trying to blow her up, again... While the action heats up, so do her relationships with the darkly attractive Ranger and the seductive Joe. You can't ask for more in a romantic mystery/crime/suspense novel. This is a five-star romp all the way. Janet Evanovich should stick to the crime/mystery genre and avoid the zappy romances she writes with a partner."
4,Eleven on Top,Any book that has me giggling all the way through to the end is worth a read. If you're looking for deep thought read something else. If you're looking for a book that will make you smile and giggle at the outrageous characters and the situations that the main character seems to repeatedly get herself into you'll enjoy this book.
2,Disappointing....,"First, I have been a religious fan of this series; I've bought each paperback as soon as it came out and even special-ordered an autographed hardback. I used to check the author's website.This book, however, was a major disappointment. I was warned by a friend that the author went backwards with this book, but I still was a believer and unfortunately made the purchase. I don't like the direction she took Stephanie. Perhaps the author is just running out of fresh ideas and is reworking these characters in bizarre angles? This book reminded me of a sit-com that has stayed on tv too long and has gotten silly. I haven't bought any of the books written since this one came out. My advice is to just borrow a copy from the library if you want to read it. And don't expect too much."
5,Always the same,it's time for Stephanie to grow up a little. I have begun picturing her as a 60 year old lady who still can't make up her mind and the world has grown weary and moved on.
4,"Yeah, she's back!","I'm a big fan and am really glad to see that Janet seems to be back on track. I didn't enjoy 10 Big Ones or Metro Girl and was worried 11 On Top would be my last from this author. I am happy to report, I am gladly waiting for the next one. Stephanie is back in trouble even though she is trying to take charge of her life with disasterous results. I would like to have seen her grow just a little, but maybe in the next one. This is a quick funny read that had me laughing out loud and reading into the wee hours of the morning. I highly recommend this one!"
3,Please enter a title for your review,"the balance between humour and seriousness is perfect but the balance between developments in the mystery and repetitive banal everyday stuff (walking the dog, changing clothes, getting food, acquiring transport) isn't. i mean in the first quarter of the book we understand that someone is trying to kill Stephanie, or at least make her fear for her life, and by the end of the third quarter we're still no closer to the culprit being caught. shouldn't some progress have been made? isn't that what a plot's about? it meanders with repeats of the same bombing scenarios, falls to the background, and then is all wrapped up with a scooby doo ending."
1,good grief,"Well, slapstick is the only word that comes to mind with this latest by Janet Evanovich....as in overworked and under-funny.The same sight gags are used again and again making it lazy writing as well.I started reading, then skimming, and finally took it between thumb and forefinger to the local thrift shop. Hope they can get 50 cents for it."
2,I've enjoyed the series ... but ...,"Stephanie was a caricature of herself. She didn't ring true this time around. She was too silly and her situations were too outrageous to believe. I've read better Plum fan fiction than what was delivered in EOT.In fact, after reading the entire series, I'm wondering if Janet ghosted this one. It was predictable ... but that's not a bad thing if the plot is fully mastered. The 4 missing men just didn't seem to be a very important element in the plot -- and that was intended to _be_ the plot. I think the author was more interested in creating slapstick-like situations than penning a story with twists and turns for her readers to both think about, and laugh.It's true, I had a few giggles; but overall I think the author needs to re-connect with the characters she has created. Here's hoping that Number Twelve will be better."
4,Short but sweet,"Unlike many of the other reviewers, I've loved all of the books in the Stephanie Plum series and this one was no exception. I like the fact that Steph is trying out a new career and really hope the next book sees her continuing on at Rangeman and getting more involved with Ranger. I don't particularly want to see her settle down with either guy at this point, but would like to see a shake up in her personal life in book twelve. Those of us who are fans of Ranger want to see things progress further than the occassional flirting since Evanovich has spent the last six books building him up. The only complaint I do have with this book is the fact that it took me all of five hours to read it but for some reason takes Evanovich a year to write it. I wish she would cease with re-releasing the old books that were bad to begin with and haven't improved with age. I'd rather see a new Stephanie Plum novel every six months."
4,Zany Characters Abound,"I don't read Evanovich when I'm looking for something deeply literary. That said, I think she is one of the best of the best as far as sheer entertainment goes. I've thoroughly enjoyed every one of the Stephan Plum novels and, ss always, this one is a scream. Evanovich is fabulous at creating zany characters. The food fight was priceless. I'll certainly be coming back for more."
3,Twelve Sharp,"Over the years I have enjoyed reading many of the books Janet Evanovich has written. I was delighted with the Stephanie Plun series #1 through 11. Unfortunately number 12 missed the sastisfaction mark. I felt the incidents in several chapters were rushed, leaving Janet's usual witty details in the wind. One example is when Stephanie is placed in the trunk of a car, by the fake Ranger, with her hands cuffed behind her back. Once they arrive at the trailer, she is removed from the trunk and led to the door - at which time she reaches out and opens the door. Say what????I am hoping the #13 will be lucky and restore my faith in Janet's coverage of my Jersey girl."
4,My first Evanovich,"I bought the hardback off the bargain shelf and took it on vacation with me. I'd never read a Stephanie Plum book, so decided it was time given all the kudos these books and character have received. It was funny, if unrealistic with all the bombings and fires, yet she's unscathed. The LOL factor happened often enough, my family was starting to get annoyed with me. I will definitely consider reading another one."
3,Just Ok,I was a little disappointed with this book. I really enjoy this series and was looking forward to this book. Loved the thought of Stephanie working for Ranger full time but looks like that won't last into the next book. I read these strictly in paperbook because they aren't worth hardback prices. Felt this book's plot didn't really come together and she left the ending out. There's nothing really accomplished. We didn't really learn anything new. Felt like Evanovich wanted to write more but her publishers were yelling at her to finish so she did. Still very funny. Just was disappointed in the character development. Would recommend to anyone that's read the others in the series. Just don't expect a lot.
2,Disappointing!!,"I love Stephanie Plum and this entire series by Janet Evanovich, and so I was eagerly awaiting No. 11. But---I thought this was the worst one of the bunch. If Eleven on Top had been the first book in the series, I never would have read another."
3,Nothing New Here,"While I still enjoy all the regular characters, Stephanie, Lula, Joe and Ranger and Stephanie's family, something is missing in this book. After I finished it I realized that no new characters had been introduced! I also realized that there was no mention of what ""eleven on top"" meant.So, while I still enjoyed Stephanie and wanted to see what happened to her, I felt a big let down as far as having a new adventure. So much so I had to eat a pint of chocolate ice cream!"
4,Eleven on Top,"Fast pace and a lot of humor make this a fun read. Quirky characters and a strong, but not superhero, female lead and their misadventures draw the reader into the story. This is a good choice if you want to take a break and curl up with a good book."
5,Eleven on Top,I read these years ago but they are wonderful. I can't always tell which story was which by just looking at the cover a I read them all back to back. They were always addictive and laugh out loud funny.
3,narrator is awful,"Lorelei King is not very good as narrator. She is certainly not as good as CJ Critt. Lorelei King's voice just isn't right for most of the characters. Every time she says ""Stephanie said"" or ""Ranger said"" etc, it stands out and is annoying. CJ Critt has a way of saying those things but disguising it at the same time."
1,he blew it,"George W. Bush blew it. His presidency is falling apart at the seams at a critical moment during this election year. Where to begin? Keeping America in the dark about 9/11. An uncessary war against Iraq. Publicly supporting his defense secretary who DIDN'T DO HIS JOB. And feeding hate, fear, and lies into the hearts of Americans all over. But there's hope. We have John Kerry. He's the man who will put Democrats back on the map and save our country and win back confidence from our allies. November should be an easy victory for Kerry. I'm pretty sure of this. I expect nothing less."
1,ya people are ALL followers to the devil's puppet as your so-called President,"Who in hell,choose this worthless fool AGAIN for a 2nd time?Bush has lied on Weapon of Mass Destruction,started a war with Iraq,lost OUR friends,allies & familes because of Bush & his pussy-whipped people republican bastards need to go to hell. And for the people who supported this prick,ya needed Jesus in your hearts."
4,"Great locks, but instructions SUCK","The instructions on these locks could not possibly be more confusing. The only way we knew how to put them on our cabinets was 2 cupboards already had them on, so we just looked at those and went from there. Don't start this and think it will be a quick project!"
2,Depends on your cabinets whether you can use these,"I am an engineer so I think I know what I am doing when it comes to the installation. Unfortunately, my cabinets are too thick to use with the product and its conventional locking mechanism. With the extensions in, the device becomes too long. Ideally, you want cabinets to be about 1/8"" thicker than the magnetic mechanism as the magnet is not strong enough to work through wood thicker than that. When I asked the company why they don't just ship a stronger magnet with the kit, they told me that it works for most people. Given the percentage of people complaining about it on here, I doubt that its such a small problem."
3,SUPER hard to install!,"Once it's in, it's great. But these are incredibly hard to install!! Be sure you have a handyman/woman there to help!"
2,"sounds good, but...","I have several knobless flat cabinets in my kitchen so i bought this 9 piece set thinking it would be the best thing to keep my little one out of cabinets. I was wrong. The magnet did not go through the wood cabinets (which are average cabinets and the proper width per the instructions). You need to use a drill to make the hole for the lock so unfortunately I did not find out that the magnet key could not read through my wood kitchen cabinets until I had already drilled a dime-sized hole in the cabinet. You also can't use it on cabinets that do not have a divider frame. You can not possibly forsee these pitfalls until you've opened the package and attempted to install it, and then you can't return it. I ended up only using 2 out of the 9. If you just have to try it, buy the starter set and save yourself $18."
4,QUESTION FOR ANYONE WHO HAS USED THIS PRODUCT,"I've read many of the reviews here and it seems like this product works. However, I was wondering would this product still work if it was glued on instead of screwed into the cabinet door? I haven't seen it in person but from what I'm thinking it seems like it simplifies the installation and you don't have to ruin your wood cabinetsI'd appreciate any tips I can get on this. Thanks!(Never mind my rating, I just had to put something for my request to go thru)"
1,DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!!,I have a lot of drawers and cabinets so I figured it would be best to start with 2 packages of Tot Lok's. BIG MISTAKE!!! They are so complicated and time consuming that the packages are sitting in a drawer opened and in a million parts! They will never get installed. Whatever you do... do NOT buy this product!
2,Be careful of buying this,"I bought this since some reviewers saying it works great but I was just so disappointed when I opened the package.Be warned: it needs a driller to drill holes in the cabinet doors to install this. I don't have any drill tool, and the description on Amazon does not even mention this prerequisite. So if you don't have a drill and don't want to spend extra money just to install this, forget about this and look for something else. And I live in an apartment and drilling holes in doors could be a questionable practice with my landlord.And I simply don't think such product designed for children should need such drill tool. It needs much simpler installation.Also as other reviewers have mentioned, the manual is absolutely a myth. You probably need some good geometrical and craftsmanlike sense to decode and install the pieces.So I have not installed the product after it is opened. Not giving it one star is because I still feel this may work well if it is installed properly."
4,Will definitely keep your kids out.,"We installed these to keep the kids out of the knife drawers. They worked well at first but had a learning curve. Visitors to the house found it impossible to work, because we had to have the magnet positioned just so. That is actually a good safety feature, because the kids know the magnet opens the drawers and would attempt to open the drawers when they get their hands on the magnet.As far as keeping the kids out, it worked well. I'd say it's been in our drawer for about six years. We no longer use it and it hasn't worked well for about a year or so. The magnet no longer unlatches the lock and we can't get into the drawer.This is a good lock, but require the willingness to drill into the woodwork of your cabinets. It takes work for people to learn. I think it should have lasted longer than five years, but maybe that's all most people need. 4 stars for the fact that it does what it's designed to do but not 5 stars, because it has issues."
3,Bunbury Girls' Impressive First,"Deborah Lisson is from my WA town.She has written a cleverly put together tale, involving time travel and pirates, mixing real life with fiction.While the story is easy to enjoy, there is a fair bit of violence described and it gave me nightmares!"
4,Van Bra,Uneventful transaction w/ quick shipment! Item as describled - Nice and large - Some difficulty with fit. Looks nice!! Thank you!!! A++++++
4,Better than its reputation,"While not a masterpiece, this is also far from the mess most critics took it for. An intelligent failure (or modest success)Bergman looks at Germany in the 20s as laying the groundwork for Hitler and the Nazis.Liv Ullman is terrific, as always. And if David Carradine is only good, not great, he certainly didn't deserve the critical attackshe received. The nature of his character is a man so locked in passivity as to be enigmatic. You might not like that kind ofcharacter, but it's certainly not the actor's fault for carrying it out well.Yes, some of it is slow, and some a bit obvious, but those charges could also be leveled against some Bergman films labeledmasterpieces.As a cautionary tale of where we were once before, and could end up again, I've certainly seen far worse. It has some trulychilling moments. And I think seeing it again may reveal even more..."
2,JAMES BOND MEETS CABARET!,"3/4 of this movie is a CABARET rip-off.The last 1/4 rips off...James Bond (and more)...!yes, the great Ingmar Bergman rips off James Bond----FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE and DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER. The last 1/4 of this movie is actually kinda trippy, and like Carridine says in his commentary, seems like a totally different movie.This movie was released the same year as the upbeat STAR WARS---though here there's a scene of a dead horse being carved up!!! That downbeat nonsense is partly the reason the upbeat STAR WARS was such a hit.This movie takes place in depression era Germany----though David Carridine's character has lots of money for booze and cigarettes, which is the sort of unintentional idea Bergman wouldn't want his fans to think about."
3,Grows On You,"GROWTH is a derivative, yet satisfying, fun watch. I rented the film. It isn't something I would own at a high price, but it was an enjoyable watch. Mircea Monroe just shines in this film and is a fantastic quirky character. The entire cast does a good job trying to take a typical plot and treat it with dignity and seriousness. The special effects are decent enough. The plot moves at a good pace. It does have a few holes, but this is an expectation in this type of film. It is a fun way to kill some time, but don't expect to be swept away."
3,Horror Fans,"I found this movie to be different, almost like body snatchers except this things are like slugs taken over the body and than some weird mutation happens, but it was entertaining and I found it to be a good watch."
2,Pass on this one.,"This is a poor plot if I ever saw one. The parasites look good for the most part and I had hopes the story could hold together but oh no. The story just falls flat and becomes a bunch of babel about pushing the human evolution up a few notches, sure, hit me up with some cool parasites doc. I want to be a super human, sounds great. Ian Patrick Williams is pretty creepy in his roll as Mason and really show me how bad old Richard Riehle is in his role as the man who may save the day. Now if your a Nora Kirkpatrick fan like I am you may have to see this flick. Nora has been in a bunch of TV shows and I think she really is the only resign to see this film. Christopher Shand is good in his roll as Justin and I look forward to seeing him in a good movie some day. But two or three good actors can not save a bad film in this case. Pass this turd right on by folks and if you must check it out don't say I didn't tell you so."
4,It Will Grow On You,"The movie starts slow, but gets going after a few minutes. The theme is typical of an experiment gone awry! Man is always screwing around with something he has no business messing with. Always thinking about the almighty dollar, instead of ""what's safe"". Worth watching twice, the kind of movie you might miss something the first time around."
5,DONT TAKE CHANCES WITH YOUR PRECIOUS PHOTOS-,"I'm so afraid of losing my 35,000 photos that I back them up regularlyon CDs or DVDs and store them in the 1150. I now have 4 of them, and will indeed buy more when needed. The 1150 is perfect for DVD and CDvertical storage of about 60 in cases."
5,The best book on civil aircraft!,"I bought this book for the first time and I have never seen a book on aircraft that was so detailed. I love aviation and if you love aviation and civil aircraft, this is the book for you."
1,DO NOT ORDER THIS FROM RESELLER DUDJUNG,Beware...do not order this CD from reseller dudjung...he shipped me a defective CD and will not respond to my emails about it...totally irresponsible...have asked Amazon to delist him...beware
4,Good product; bad seller,"I purchased this through an Amazon marketplace seller and I've already given the seller (Pacific Rim) a bad review. the product itself is tasty, but you'd be better off forgoing the convenience of the bowl it comes in and ordering the same product much more economically direct from Amazon in multi-packs that are in cellophane bags. After all, who among us doesn't have a bowl in the house? The flavorful noodles in a savory broth are a perfect lunch or first course for dinner."
1,ATROCIOUS,"This CD contains absolutely no works by the original artists. Legacy Entertainment Inc. has plainly lied right on the CD cover. The songs do not sound too bad, but it's like passing off your brother as the Rolling Stones, the Beatles or Pink Floyd... it just doesn't cut it. THIS CD IS NOT WORTH TWO CENTS and I WILL NEVER BUY ANYTHING FROM LEGACY ENTERTAINMENT AGAIN. I sent the CD, jewel case and inserts back to Legacy in tiny crushed up pieces with a rather incensed note."
4,Great Database Management Book,"I really liked this book. It explained database management systems very well, and wasn't too boring to read either! I also really like how they use pretty much the same database example throughout the book. That makes it much faster and easier to read."
3,"Class Textbook, but not much more","I had to get this textbook for a class. That's really all I can say about this book. I'd like to say that this book was informative, but you can find better. I wish this textbook was a little less verbose and more examples to help understand some of the more complex topics, then it would be great."
2,I don't understand the purpose of this text,"Frankly, I do not understand the purspose of this text. It's obvious that the book covers everything in DBMS, from the very basic like SQL to the very complicated and detailed like internal schema of DBMS.Everything is covered, but not comprehensively. I think the author tries to show you just a little bit of everything.If you have extra bucks and lot of spare time, go for it at your own risk.In fact, I bought this book just because it is a required text for the semester. After buying it, I was extremely disappointed. I learned most of DBMS stuff (oracle, SQL, web programming) by searching online and on other books from shool library. But it is definitely not from this one."
5,Nice!,Very good book. I have already used database and SQL but I had never learn theory and this book is excellent for the students which are not beginners but not very experimented.Simple examples and very good theory
3,"Not a great textbook, not a terrible textbook","The textbook comes complete with great online supplemental information, but that doesn't make it a great textbook. I've found that the material is often not explained thoroughly enough. Also, some of the exercises expect you to know about concepts that are not covered adequately in the text (for example, there are questions on 2NF, and there is no more than a couple sentences on the subject). The material as a whole is not explained very clearly, and the chapters on the lower-level subject material (systems) are not quite up to par.I suppose the reason I was a bit disappointed is because this is such an important subject, and I was hoping for a real keeper. This book is decent, but definitely not great."
1,Can't be worse,"This is by far the worst textbook I've ever had. The language is ambiguous, uninteresting and full of typos. From time to time this book makes me doubt my ability of reading English. By the way I am a ""straight A"" student. I wish I didn't have to read it."
5,great textbook,"In my opinion, it's one of the best books on the subject, and it is for a reason that this textbook is used in Berkeley's undergraduate EE/CS database CS186 course. I read reviews below from some of the straight 'A' students that the book is too complex and confusing. Others complain it doesn't cover common DBMS vendor implementations (Oracle, SQL). Again, this is a well-written book that thoroughly covers the theory behind every vendor's database design, and it's difficult to see why one would expect it to be an easy reading. If you like serious, unwatered-down textbook style reading that requires some thought on your part then this book is right for you."
1,Worst database book I've ever purchased,"I am a Database Admin who was required to purchase this book as part of my Master's program. I can honestly say that I'll never refer this book again.This book is way too heavy on theory and does a poor job of providing enough practical examples to support the material discussed. Any examples provided do a lousy job of illustrating what's discussed.It's unfortunate that schools choose to use books such as these but I can only assume politics are involved. This book is over $100 brand new.... an expensive paperweight.There are better and CHEAPER books on database internals and theory. If you're forced to buy this for school, buy it used!"
1,For Kindle Edition: Not usable,"On the Kindle the book is quite unusable: Extremely slow loading, opening, regularly crashed the Kindle. Is the only book which does that to the Kindle.Bought the paper edition."
5,SNOW MOM & SNOW DAD WANTED!!!,OH HOW CAN YOU NOT LIKE THIS SIMPLE EASY TO HAVE YOUR LITTLE ONES READ TO YOU SNOWCHILDREN STORY. WE LOVED IT! IT GAVE THE KIDS SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT... MAYBE THEY SEE WHAT A SPECIAL THING IT IS AFTER ALL TO HAVE PARENTS TO DRESS U & PAT YOUR CHEEK & KISS YOUR NOSE JUST BECAUSE THEY LOVE YOU SO! IT'S A KEEPER!
4,Excellent metal,"I love Eidolon. The Music is great. All of their stuff gets me so hyped. If you love metal, and want some great music in your collection... get this album.. and all others that you can find. you wont be dissapointed. Glen and Shawn Drover are like the best team in music, that anyone could hear. The style is metal but it has a totally new sound to it.. it a revalation in metal. the riffs are in your face and yet just there to make the songs. everything works into everything.. if you like King Diamond. check this out. As well as Infernal Majesty."
3,A confused (but pretty good) metal band,"Confused is the first word that comes to mind when reviewing Eidolon. After listening to their ""Nightmare World"" disc a couple times, I'm not certain they know what kind of metal they want to play. And sometimes that's good. At times, they come across as a thrashed-up Queensryche; for some reason, vocalist Brian Soulard keeps making me think of Tate. At other times, they're somewhat of a dumbed-down early era Anthrax or Testament, but not as chunkariffic. And still at other times, they drop into lo-fi, sludgey as hell Sabbath impersonators.What this all means is you've got an extremely diverse and varied metal album. However, it also means that there's no flow and little passion poured into just one of those styles so that the songs would be more memorable. Looking back, only ""Lunar Mission"" and ""Dreamscape"" stand out as great songs. Worth a try for fans of speedier thrash and prog-metal vocals, otherwise, pass on by."
1,Boring Progressive Metal,"If u like Progressive Metal,then u should like this album.I figured that since Glen Drover was in the band(Glen played guitar on King Diamond's ""House of God"" CD),Eidolon might sound similiar to King Diamond.I was wrong,this is just an ""Average"" Progressive Metal album that was very boring to listen to.The only highlights on the album are the ""Title Track"" and some good guitar riffs and solos.If u r looking for some better Progressive Metal,check out Mercyful Fate,Fates Warning, or Iced Earth."
4,Yesterday They Took My Baby,"Real life stories of adoption, the pain it causes to both birthfamily and adoptee's. When it comes to real people spilling out their feelings, the truth be told! Adoption is NOT the answer. Ben Wicks did this so well."
1,Cheap Burned DVDRs,This show is of a low quality and the discs are poor quality DVD-Rs (burned discs) in cheap thin packs with color copied inserts. I purchased this show and it didn't work on my DVD player because it was burned - I had to return it to Amazon. [...]. People who are thinking about buying this series should know that it is not as good as others out there. Save your money.
4,First date,Sunako has to find a date before her father arrives but the guys are the only ones who can do the job. Watch Sunako go through all four dates and the one she enjoyed the most. I liked this volume beacuse there was more things in common between Sunako and Kyohei other than their constant fighting. You can see where Sunako gets her strength from when her mother comes to retrieve her father.
4,A nice enough collection of stories...,"There's not a lot of cohesion between the chapters of this volume, but it's still nicely done. A few of the chapters are filler, but it's well done filler. Everything is still original & fresh.In this chapter Sunako's aunt decides to put her on a (dum dum DUM) blind date. Rather than put her on a blind date that would reveal that Sunako's learned very little about ladyhood, the boys decide that one of them will pretend to be her boyfriend, who of course ends up being Kyohei. Since the two of them are very unwilling, hypnotism is brought into it... with humorous results.I am constantly finding things to like about this series & I always find myself recommending it to others."
5,clock alarm,"The Clock was purchased for my son. He has a sleeping disorder. It was detailed and very specific before I purchsed the product. I was surprised the clock arrived one day earlier than was predicted. What we didn't get was the instructions on the clock. Nothing to show what the buttons are used for.We are very happy with the product. My son has gotton up every morning now by himself, except for one morning. That morning he was experimenting with the buttons to see how they work. I am so much very pleased with the product. It has given my son some independence from me. Thank You."
1,Cheap Tools,This product is only suitable for some one who is going to use it around the home. It consist of poorly made tools of inferior quality that will not stand every day use.
5,"Wow, this set is very impressive.","I was hoping to be #1 of 2500 but I wasn't even close. That's the only real issue I have with this set. The dimensions listed doesn't really give an idea of how big this set is until you have the big box in front of you. The only other issue is that it would have been nice if the dvd menus would have been remastered to show a consistent menu for all discs with the correct disc number instead of the original disc label info from the original 32 sets. The set was packaged well. I only had one disc loose and it was undamaged because of the plastic casing. Out of 131 discs, I only had 2 or 3 with slight scratches. I scanned all the discs on my PC and there wasn't a bad disc in the bunch. Which is impressive."
5,A Must Have for any DS Fan!,A great quality collection. A must have for any Dark Shadows fan. Well worth the investment for many hours of true DS enjoyment.
3,"Delayed Until July 10th, March 27, 2012","Dark Shadows - 'The Complete Original Series' 131-DVD Set is delayed again.According to a notice from MPI Home Video on 3/27/2012, this release has been moved back from April 2012 to July 10, 2012. (This follows their previous announcement that it would be pushed back to May 8, 2012.)"
3,Here's the series for $190,"It may not be the Deluxe Edition, but it's all 1225 episodes so who cares? The limited release version will not appreciate in value..... what do you do with it when new formats are created? (just look @ the VHS tape as an example) I've been in this end of the business since '97 and have seen DIVX come & go... SD, HD, Blu-ray...Just follow this link to check it out.[...]"
1,$400????,"I love Dark Shadows--a huge fan, have reproduction memorabilia and some of the original props--but $400 for the entire series is much too much. I'd pay $129 for this set, tops. And that's what the eventual price will be..do not pay this wildly inflated price for this DVD set!"
3,Not worth the High Cost,"Received item on time, however for the price I found it odd, that item was not factory sealed. I called Amazon however girl could not tell me if item should have been sealed or if item just comes like that and was informed I could send it back, they did not have any in stock. Kept item because I am a Dark Shadows fan. Also it was a gift from my husband and would have cost quite a bit to send it back. Have not watched all the DVD's, however the ones I have watched the quality is ok, I think the quality should have been much better especially for the price."
5,Amazing,"I love dark shadows, this complete collection is awesome, I will be able to enjoy it for years to come. Definately a great buy for any true fan of the show."
5,Dark Shadows Fan,I am a long time Dark Shadows Fan. I Love the way this product was done. If you love Dark Shadows and you want all of the DVDs I recommend that you get this one.
4,"Dark Shadows, the Original series","I'm only up to episode 63 but it was what I was looking for for years. It is long before Banabas comes into the series. It is fun watching the boom mic shadow crossing the faces of the actors. the flubbed lines, and the melodrama with a gothic twist. I have wanted the series for decades and finally have it. You have to see it to believe it. Watch Joan Bennet blow her lines as all the actors eventually do because of the short period of time they get to learn them.You also get the inside stories of the cast and how they worked together. I have months to go before I see it all but I am enjoying a truly one of a kind show in the process."
2,missing discs,Dark Shadows: The Complete Original Series (Deluxe Edition)Unfortunately there are missing discs. What a disappointment considering how expensive this set is. Amazon is apparently unable to replace discs #49 & #50 that where missing from the 'coffin'(episodes 453-462 & 463-472). I received duplicate discs #53 & #54(episodes 493-502 & 503-512). The box was also missing the packing slip. I would call this poor quality control. I called cust serv and was told that Amazon is 'out of stock' so I'm unable to get the missing discs or return the duplicates without generating a completely new order. I've ordered from Amazon since 2000 and this ranks as my most bitter disappointment during this whole time.
5,So glad I got this!,Item came exactly as described. Contains all episodes of Dark Shadows........even the 1966 ones prior to the arrival of Barnabus Collins.
4,"LOVE it, minus one tiny thing...","I love the packaging and how this came, but my postcard wasn't signed. I sent MPI an email as I got the package too late to call, but I'll call them tomorrow and see whats up. Now to check to see if any discs are missing...PS - I really don't care about the autograph, as I like pictures better, and I'm not going to complain since I got a REALLY good deal on the set."
5,"At long last, the complete dark shadows is mine!","I just got mine in the mail on friday, and I'll start by saying how great it is. Its one thing to see photos but in person its even better. MPI did a wonderful job. Well worth the money. The disks are the same as before, but I've noticed that the 'beginning' no longer have these promos for other shows such as 'where the action is' or 'bewitched' over the closing credits. I like it that way better. I love the theme more then hearing about other shows that were on when this aired. I also want to note I tried each and every disc in the box (all 131) and they all work just fine! Barnabas is the man (or vampire)!"
5,the amati girls dvd,"Watched this movie on t.v. some time ago and looked it up on Amazon sure enough it was listed! Great ""chick"" flick! The movie is about a family of daughters and their mother. It has a little bit of everything drama, comedy and reality when you least expect it. Outstanding cast including Cloris Leachmen as the mother. Even if you have never seen the movie I would recommend buying it, you won't be sorry!!"
4,Still good in the 21st Century,"Whilst now there's plenty of underwater trout video, I've seen trout performing these manoeuvres at very close range. The descriptions of each photo are the key."
3,Good but Challenging,"I am not a math person and this starts off written for me. Then it gets so overwhelming that I can't finish it. I have put it back on the shelf to review later.I've decided to let Quicken help me rather than create spreadsheets - that way all of my accounts are in one place, including my partners.The hard stuff for me in the book is really the financial planning sections rather than the checking and savings. And of course, that's what I was hoping this would help identify for me.There were some (very few) tips on why some accounts should be set up a certain way as a gay couple.Basically finances seem to be finances and this doesn't exactly cater to gays except in the title...maybe later in the book, the part that doesn't make sense to me there will be more."
1,Save your money,I was very disappointed with the performance of this vacuum. The reason it has good suction is because it has little resistance from the filter. The filter in this vacuum is a cloth-like material that you can see through. Any small particles go right through the filter and are blown out the sides of the vacuum. What a mess...
3,Brief Stories Make you Wonder,I read this book rather quickly.The brief accounts of what happened leaves you wondering why the author left out details.I believe this book is better suited for the young adult reader catergory.One chapter about a kidnapping is very drawn out and is hard to read because it seems like the writer has no idea what to right.It drags on with very detailed descriptions of everything that is unimportant.If you have a interest in Mystery and just want something Quick to read this book is perfect and most of the Chapters are interesting and worth reading.
2,"Interesting crimes, the telling is long and lacking","While the crimes chronicled in this book are certainly great and unsolved, the descriptions lack power of delivery. They also go on much too long, the same message could have been delivered with far fewer words. The crimes discussed are:*) The skyjacking by the man known only as D. B. Cooper*) The murder of Serge Rubinstein*) The theft of artworks from the Brooklyn museum*) The kidnapping of Charlie Brewster Ross, supposedly the first kidnapping ever done in the United States.*) The lost archeological find known as ""The Peking Man.""*) The Borden axe murders.If you are interested in unsolved crimes in general and these in particular, you will be better served by looking elsewhere."
3,"Good themes, not the greatest writing","I think the author in this book did not make the most of the excellent stories, which, if properly written, would have made this an excellent book."
3,Brief Sories Make you Wonder,I read this book rather quickly.The brief accounts of what happened leaves you wondering why the author left out details.I believe this book is better suited for the young adult reader catergory.One chapter about a kidnapping is very drawn out and is hard to read because it seems like the writer has no idea what to right.It drags on with very detailed descriptions of everything that is unimportant.If you have a interest in Mystery and just want something Quick to read this book is perfect and most of the Chapters are interesting and worth reading.
5,Awesome for Pork Lovers!,I bought this book as a gift for my husband's birthday. It is great! We have made many of the recipes and they are easy to follow. It is our go to book for roasts and ribs. You won't be sorry you bought it because it contains recipes for every taste. It really helps to have something to reference for pork recipes that goes well beyond barbeque sauce - although if that's what you love you will find plenty of things to choose from.
5,My Pork Bible,"Loving to cook lead me to this thorough book by someone who loves Pork. Pork is a new food adventure for me. I kept borrowing this cookbook from a friend until I felt guilty and got me own! I like the author's short chat with many recipes to deepen your cooking experience. His recipes are clear, interesting and diverse. This could become your pork bible. And pork, your ""other white meat""."
4,enjoyable read,"good character development, story seemed to drag a little. hope to read some more by this author."
4,Thoughtful and charming,"Although slightly uneven writing. Best if you like philosophy mixed in with the story, which the author does well."
3,not enough story,The writing kept me going through half the book but it was not enough to get me to the end. I gave up. The book does not have a story. I will look for the author again but next time I hope she has something to write about.
5,3rd generation reader loves this story,"This is my grandmother's favorite book. She wanted to share it with me, but since she loves this book so and can't part with her copy, she found me a paperback copy at a rummage sale. I admit, I looked at the cover and thought, ""well, I'll read it if I have some extra time on my hands."" Over New Years, I was quite bored and so I picked the book up. I couldn't put it down! Ms. Turnbull's writing, though the book was written in the 1920's, was captivating. The story of Jeannie could give any current historical fiction writer a run for their money. Absoulutely fascinating and endearing. I will be holding on to my copy for sure!"
1,LOADS of problems,"In this book, Marianthe (blithely called Mari by her teacher who can't bother to learn to pronounce her name), is ""foreign."" From where? Who knows. What language does she speak? Who knows. To what culture does she belong? Who knows. She's a generic stand-in. Her teacher doesn't bother in any way to try to teach her any English, yet she magically learns it just by hearing it. Just as one (sadly of many) examples, Mr. Petrie, the teacher, makes comments about Marianthe, informing the class that maybe someday Marianthe can tell her story ""in words,"" as if she has no words herself. This is not the book to use."
2,"Disappointed at first, but pleased now!","At first I was very disappointed with the quality of this item, but I must tell you that I was refunded the amount of the purchase and now am very pleased! The refund was so fair and so promptly given! Thanks!"
4,An overview of major laws and the legal system,"In this 300-page paperback you can find an overview of major areas of the law, from driving infractions to estate planning to the structure and rules of CA legal system. Most importantly, the book is written in a very simple and easy to undrestand language and has references to specific sections of the law if you want to go into details on your own."
3,Nice overview of California law,"While I havent read all of this book, just sections, its great to have a reference book like this lying around. It covers main legal topic and gives links to other relevant books if I want to explore topics in more detail!The own downside is that it's a bit expensive for a reference book!"
5,lawyer loves Nolo,"the Nolo line of Law book are fantastic for non lawyers and a good starting point for lawyers too.-Stefani, J.D."
4,One of Ennio Morricone's finest!,"Ennio Morriocne's score for ""Guns for San Sebastian"" stands up to some of his best ""Western"" scores. ""The Chase"", underscoring the film's credit sequence, harkens to Morriocne's main titles to such films as ""The Good The Bad and The Ugly"" and ""The Big Gundown"" with it's driving rhythms and male chorus. The main love theme, appearing numerous times throughout the score, equals Morricone's main theme to ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" with it's lush strings and solo female voice. This score is a must for anyone who love's Morrionce's Western film music. The second half of this double bill is the score to ""Dark of the Sun"" written by French jazz composer Jacques Loussier. Ironically, the music sounds similar in style to Ennio Morricone's ""Gangster Thrillers"" such as ""The Sicilian Clan"" or ""Violent City"" The music is driving and forceful, making a nice match with ""Guns for San Sebastian"" (Though a second Morricone score would have been more appropriate)"
5,best k-cups you can get,i love super strong coffee and i've been using k-cups for years. so far i haven't found anything even close to the Extra Bold. i order by the case of 100+ lol
2,online coffee bar,"these k-kups are dangerously bold, in that when they start to go stale they get bitter fast. Unfortunately these had started to go.I have no idea whether there is a way to check their ""use by"" date."
4,It's a good way to begin...,"As the Deaf son of an ASL teacher, I have seen this book used in its full capacity. When one looks at the textbook at the surface, one can note that it has superb organization, relevant vocabulary regarding various common topics (i.e. locations, daily activities, etc.), some good cultural information, and a video that serves as a very effective learning tool to build receptive skills and increase understanding of the language itself. One thing, however, that's lacking about this book, is the amount of vocabulary. The most difficult thing about learning a language is the vocabulary aspect, and this book doesn't help much in that aspect. Therefore, my mother uses ""A Basic Course In Sign Language"" as an supplement to fortify the grammatical and vocabulary aspects of the language. The lack of vocabulary and grammatical concepts nonwithstanding, this is a very good way to start in your endeavour to learn American Sign Language!"
4,Excellent Book if you're taking a class,"First, you need to have both the book and the video and a class. It's not the best text for trying to teach yourself ASL. I did not start using this book until I was in level 2 of ASL at BCC and we started in the middle of the book. If you're just starting to learn ASL, put the video on slow-mo. I took a look at the video for the beginning units and the sign is insanely fast for a beginner. Flipside to that remark, you see sign at a fast speed so you must adapt to it more quickly. This is an old book, last copyrighted in 1992, so some signs are outdated (especially ethnicities). Read the grammar and cultural notes! They're very important for using ASL and interacting with the Deaf community. It's not there but it would be nice if the vocabulary signs had a description underneath (palm orientation, handshape, direction of travel) and translation OR in the DVD, include a review for all signs."
3,Wish it was better,"To be truthful, I'm not a fan of this book. The people in the disk sign way to fast for a beginner, and there is no sound. Understandable considering that the people are deaf, but the people using this are generally hearing so its not much help. They dont show you what extatly the words on the pages are, just a visual. The visual is not even very good, its very hard to desipher and understand. For a begginer book, i do not reccomend it. Its just not a very good book and it only roughly teaches you signs."
3,Signing Textbook,I didn't realise that the book (I bought it used) was not that helpful without the CD. Apparently they originally went together. The book shows signs without identifying them.
4,SN Level 1,"This is a great book for those taking an ASL course. I wouldn't recommend it to someone who is trying to learn on their own without Deaf or interpreter /teacher/friend/housemate/tutor to help them learn. The Signing Naturally series is set up really well as far as how information is laid out. It will be easy to learn very basic phrases to get started in simple conversation. For the DVD you really must have someone guiding you along because the dialogue becomes more complex as the series goes on and you will likely miss much of what is being said without interpretation. I bought this book for my boyfriend who is new to the Deaf/ASL community and wanted to give him a learning tool to get started. It was a great beginner book for me and I think *in conjunction* with other materials makes a great base. There is a LOT of vocabulary, less grammar."
5,Advanced Cardiovascular Life Support,Just want to thank you for such a speedy delivery on my ACLS manual that I purchased on 9/9/09. I am attending college as a nursing student and will need this book come next qtr. I wanted to get a jump on studing the information that this book certainly provides. I would recommend it for all nursing students. It is relevant to what I will be studying and along with the disk will serve the purpose that I need. The price was of the book was better than I could have obtained somewhere else. Thank you again for providing your services and I recommend Amazon.com to all my fellow nursing students.
5,ASL,"Item arrived in great condition. The workbook was listed as used, but I couldn't tell. Delivery was prompt. And it was cheaper than the college bookstores used textbooks!!"
2,Not So Good,"Book arrived 4 weeks after my calss had started, and I ended up being extremely behind on material. Book was damaged and missing pages."
3,Needs a better description,"I probably wouldn't have bought this book had I known there was such extensive writing in it. But given the good price, it will work for what I need it to do."
2,"cute, but cheap!",plastic strings will come off and not go back on! was cute for the few days that it lasted! :(
1,what a terrible mess,What a mess.I was so vexed when i watched this film.The talented black actors in this should feel shame to even be connected to this flim. Just a massive waste of they're time and talent and mine own time for watching this mess of a film.A massive let down for the black movie making industry full stop.
1,Hated it!,The only reason I bought this movie was because of Terrence Howard. I was very dissapointed. Low budget all the way. Don't waste your money; not even on the bootleg!
2,love chronicles,This is a love story and comedy put togther i think it could have been way better but the ending is nice
3,Blaylock Farce,"J.P. Blaylock's THE LAST COIN defies genre identity--best to call it Blaylock farce. It's not the sort of book I wanted to quit reading, hoping it might have a creative ending. Unfortunately there wasn't any actual ending beyond the disappearance of the villain and death of his murderous female partner. The search for the thirty pieces of silver Judas received for betraying Christ, the plot in its entirety, may still be in progress and someday some creature may collect them all and achieve immortality. The fable is struck in such a realistic setting with such a lineup of unbelievably stupid characters that it's life blood must surely have been drawn from an actual human vein. I'm surprised Hollywood hasn't snapped this one up, complete with the Hollywood ending."
3,"Not widescreen format, not noted","It's getting to the point where you have to peruse DVDs with a magnifying glass to see what you're getting, and I was very disappointed to find on arrival that these 2 movies are not in widescreen format, and that is not listed anywhere in the technical description of the set."
2,Historical Fantasy,This is the 2nd book in the Dalriada Trilogy. I did not enjoy this book as much as the first because it reads like a soap opera. The characters face so many problems and tight spots and each scenario gets more and more dramatic and unrealistic that I was glad when it was over. I will not be reading the third one.
4,A really Enjoyable Second Book,"AD 81 Britain is in the grip of a ruthless Roman official, Agricola, the Roman governor. He is intent upon subduing the remaining unconquered territory in the whole of Britain, Scotland or as the Romans called it Alba.Rhiann is an Alban priestess who has been coerced into a political marriage to Eremon, an exiled Irish prince. But out of this joining of convenience has grown a powerful love story. In them lies the hopes of a whole nation.Will they have the time to formulate any plans to thwart the forces of Rome, who are relentlessly advancing north toward Alba . . .This book relates the story of a relatively small nation that is being remorselessly challenged by the might of one of the most powerful Empire's of the then known world.I have been waiting in anticipation of this second book in the trilogy. I suppose I will now be doing the same for the third. Come on Jules get that word processor warmed up."
3,Not as good as I thought,"I previously gave this a 4 star rating. Since then, 2 of the welds, near the center of the rack, have broken. Unfortunately, it has only a one year warranty. It's not quite as sturdy as I first thought.Here's what I originally said: ""This rack is very nicely made with thick stainless wire, invisible welds, and no sharp edges. Very sturdy and useful.We leave it in all the time and it prevents scratches on our beautiful cobalt blue sink. You can really bear down on it when scrubbing a pot, and it will not bend."""
5,Worth the splurge,"These sink racks are well worth the money. We installed the Kohler sink 3 years ago and decided not to purchase the racks at that time. You cannot find mats to fit, so finally bit the bullet and bought these racks for both sinks! They're fantastic and look beautiful while being very functional."
3,SalSoul SalSucks!,"Actually this album is good for New Years Eve parties and the best song is Christmas Time, which has a 1960's, 70's Philly soul sound. Very pretty song."
3,charts unreadable,"I ordered this book in the Kindle edition and while the content seemed good, the Charts in the Kindle edition were unreadable, so I had to ask for a refund. My suggestion is to purchase the book if you are interested."
3,Creatively Done,"This is a really neat text. As a Kundalini Yoga Teacher, I turn a lot of people on to it. I look forward to another with alternative sets."
1,review,How many people will hafto suffer intensly and unneccesarily playing with spiritual energy?Strong breathing exercises and kriyas are dangerous. WE are in a world with kundalini orginizations where the founder has no genuine experience.Read gopi krishnas and muktanandas autobiographies before starting so called kundalini yoga.If you are the rare indivisual with a awakening before your mind is 99 percent pure.You will wish you researched kundalini and its power better.meditate pray and make good karma.be patient not dangerous and foolish
1,"No no no. This is a big, long ad for Las Vegas.","If I knew this thing was produced by the Travel Channel, I never woulda bought it. It's just another Travel Channel advertisement for Las Vegas. And it's filled with interviews of Rat Pack impersonators, for crying out loud.You're much better off picking up the 2-disc Rat Pack DVD produced by the History Channel. That documentary is much more thorough, contains many more interviews with people who knew the Pack intimately (Tony Curtis, Angie Dickinson, etc.) and, by the way, is a few bucks cheaper! Stay away from this piece discount bin piece of trash."
4,frankie's friends,"Love seeing the clips of frank and his pals, but it could have been longer and would have liked to have seen more of the real guys instead of the impersonators."
3,Good except for The Peter Lawford Bashing Casino Worker!,I like the Rat Pack and I like this doccumentary about Las Vegas during it's Rat pack hey day and I loved the history details of old las Vegas. My only complaint is the whiney casino worker who kept complaining about Peter Lawford just because he asked for a certain brand of cigarettes. I mean was it really necessary to trash a man no longer around to defend himself and all because he asked for a different brand of cigarettes? That part was useless and mean spirited so I have to take points off or that! At least I think this is the doccumentary with the Peter Lawford basing casino worker but I could be wrong and if it is another doccumentary then someone correct me if I'm mistaken!
5,Super Furry Fun,"I strongly suggest this cd for any fans of Super Furry Animals. Fuzzy, Psychedelic ear candy."
3,Puzzling design but well made,"This rack actually has a hole in the middle for accessing the sink stopper. It is nicely made of heavy stainless wire with invisible welds. Very sturdy and attractive.However, I am puzzled by the height of this rack, which puts the top of it very near the top of the sink divider. If you want to wash something in the small side of the sink, you have to remove this rack in order to immerse whatever you're washing. I'm sure there's a reason, but I haven't discovered it yet."
5,Como pocas,Lunna es una de las mejores voces no solo de Ponce y Puerto Rico sino de Latinoamerica. Escúchenla y se convencerán. Una pena que no grabó mucho mas.
4,Good inverter,So far these inverter has worked great and no problems! I would recommend these and at a reasonable price.The remote is a good addition.
2,POWER HOG,IT WORKS BUT IT SUCKS BATTERY POWER UP FAST AND DRAINS BATTERIES. i INSTALLED IN A BUS CONVERSION AND ONLY CONNECET WHEN WERE RUNNING TO CHARGE COMPS AND PHONES AND SUCH. i HAVE THE 3500 12 VOLT VERSION SAME COMPANY AND DONT HAVE 1/2 THE DRAINAGE WITH A LOAD (REFER 100 WATTS). THIS WILL RUN EMPTY AND DRAIN POWER. I HOOK UP TO MCI BUS WITH DUEL BATTERIES 24 VOLT SYSTEM
2,It worked but with limits and no remote,"I bought it to power up my RV trailer at my ranchAssuming that is a 24 Volt inverter, it must be intended for high power systems, but this one cuts the power at 30.5 Volts, wich is less then the voltage sent by my sun powered battery charger (at 31.5 sometimes).And looking inside, the remote control module cable was loose not soldered. Bad manufacturing.Maybe it will work for small requirements. Like ocasional tool use, or sunday kermess party with a popcorn maker."
5,Excellent video,This video was well done and gives a good perspective of how motivation works in children that struggle to succeed.
5,Delivers on its title. Perfect weekend morning music!,"Great songs, great artists, wonderful mellow but not sleepy mood. I got this disc because the track listing seemed like it would suit weekend mornings, and that is certainly the case. By pure coincidence, it was in fact Sunday morning when I first played it. Although I was reading a different newspaper and my wife was reading a novel, the mood that the disc sets is the classic easy loafing over interesting material, the delicious state of being that for millions of people is synonymous with the Sunday New York Times. I recommend it highly for exactly what the title promises."
2,Maybe because it was Saturday????.....................,"If you were raised on Getz, ""Bird"", Ellington, Hampton and all the other greats, don't plan on enjoying this CD. While the vocals are OK, none of the tracks are memorable. I've given it several listens today, but fear that this one is destined to go to the bottom of the stack...........maybe I should have waited until tomorrow, and bought the Sunday Times, but I don't think that would get me in the mood for these Jazz Moods!"
2,"Great, but a bit short","These are nice tie-downs (mine came in blue), but, for my Explorer Sprot Trac, if the load extends at at above the bed - they are just too short. I had a rubbermaid trash can standing up, and the strap barely made. If length is not a concern, go for it. For outside tie-downs on a full size pick up - I am not sure they will cut it."
5,So calming,"I love this CD. I bought it years ago, long before we had a baby or needed lullabies. It is so soothing and peaceful. Only problem is that I can't listen to it on long solo car drives because it puts me to sleep!"
4,A well written and interesting approach to the subject,"""Poltergeist: A Study in Destructive Haunting"" addresses many issues concerning and related to poltergeist, treating the subject in a very serious - and non-sensationalistic - manner. The author uses a number of sources documenting poltergeist phenomena, addresses other author's (parapsychologists, ghost-hunters, and other interested parties) interpretations (i.e. speculations) of these events, and works to establish his own unified theory of poltergeist phenomena.Those interested in poltergeists might also enjoy books written by Harry Price (author of ""The Most Haunted House in England"", and ""Poltergeist: Tales of the Supernatural)."
3,Long story poem,"I love Grace Livingstone Hill's books, and was happy to find so many of her stories for free or else inexpensively priced. This book, however, is just one long poem. I like poetry, but this is very long and I have not been able to get through it yet. It is not one of her regular story books."
2,ERRORS,"Having possession of 100 of Grace Livingston Hill books, I was excited to see one available for my Kindle. I was very disappointed with the Kindle edition. Far too many errors to make reading this book enjoyable."
3,Unusual but interesting,Ms. Hill knows how to write stories that you can't lay down before you find out what happens. I try not to read the last page but sometimes I can't wait.
5,rockabilly,Back when the stracats were considred nothing more than teen beat gurus... there was the kingBees
1,"Flimsy, Flimsy, Flimsy","Bought this product in April, and have used the tie-downs three times. I have used them for light loads only. Seems to be a major problem with the ratcheting mechanism...the dogs that are part of the mechanism bend very easily, rendering the ratchet unusable, and they fail under light loads. I have encountered no problems at all with the straps themselves, as they appear to be well made, and performed adequately. Out of the four units that came in the package, two have bent and are unusable, the third one fell apart, and I am afraid to use the fourth one. Someone could get hurt depending on these tie-downs. I would not recommend these tie-downs under any circumstances."
5,Nostalgia,"I am 84 years old and grew up in Scotland. I was 14 years old when Churchill became Prime Minister. I bought this book years ago in a bookstore and made this purchase for my elder son. It is a beautiful book and I particularly cherish the photo of the Queen leaving 10 Downing Street after she had dinner there, and extraordinary event.A story which I do not remember in the book however was that of the 8 year old son of the butler at Chartwell opening Churchill's study door and peeping in asked him ""Is it true that you are the greatest man in the whole wide world?"". Churchill replied ""Of course I'm the greatest man in the whole wide world. Now buzz off!"""
4,unique and interesting research source,"These collections of actual interviews with former Plantation Slaves are an invaluable insight into American History. Too many times, we are caught up in the ""dramatization"" of history that is provided in film and literature. Here are the actual words of those who lived through the Civil War as slaves, and how they actually felt. I recommend them highly to any and all middle and high school history teachers to have for their students."
5,"Hysterical, Bizarre, Insane, Appalling, Ingenius","Ever since I saw the movie ""CRUMB"" I've been hooked on his artwork. I agree with his idea: no matter how sick or disturbing and idea you have, you should get it out into the open anyway. Be free to express yourself. I'm not endorsing pornography and drug use, which are both evident in his work, but I still say he's one of the great artists who just never got the attention he deserved."
4,Good to the last Crumb,"The R. Crumb Coffee Table Art Book enjoys exclusive honors on my coffee table; except when my Pastor comes to call, or other easily offended folk. Thumbing through this is as close to time travel as I will ever come. It took me back years ago when I enjoyed Zap and other underground comics. My hardbound edition is truly a first class quality volumn. Which is good because friends who never enjoyed Crumb's hilarious cartoons before; can't put it down.Eric von RheinPeoria, Illinois"
3,Good,"Jerry Goldsmith was unique among 1960s film composers in that he did not have a distinguishing style like Lalo Shafrin did funk jazz or Quincy Jones blues.Some of his soundtrack music does not stand out the way those or other composers' did, but when Goldsmith was in the pocket, he could really fly: listen to some of the dramatic points on his Planet Of The Apes score.Last Run is mainly orchestral: it does not have any of the bit that you may expect from early 70s thriller music, but does have some funky moments.I have reviewed this from a vynal copy of the Last Run--in a pile from a thrift shop grab, and do not have the soundtrack this CD pairs it with."
1,x5 bluetooth headset,"buyer beware!! These are designed nicely but sound quality really makes them not worth the price. No bass at all! Everything sounds ""in a can"" Also I charged the dongle overnight and it still wouldn't transmit audio without being placed into a power source! I returned them after two days! Due to unsatisfactory audio and dongle performace. Blueant's customer support just wanted to replace my headset with another, but luckily i purchased thru amazon so i was given a full refund instead. I would not recommend these at all. Blueant needs to go back to the drawing board with these. I decided to go with plantronics bluetooth headset and am 100% happy in all aspects now, check that bluetooth headset out instead. Just my 2 cents..."
1,"Poor product, worse customer service from Toshiba","Purchased these headphones from Toshiba, volume control non-functional straight out of the packaging. Range is very poor, only 10-12 feet. Toshiba customer service less than minimally responsive."
2,Hack Hack Slash Slash Blah Blah Blah,"This is a fairly boring dungeon crawl. There's no real intrigue at all -- all of the puzzles are either solved or they're not, none of them have stages or long-running consequences. It starts off billed as a search/rescue/explore, but in the end it's just explore-and-slaughter, which kind of steals any sense of accomplishment from the players. (Same players different characters rather preferred Green Ronin's ""XYZ in Freeport"" series in which you *do* rescue the guy they're hired to rescue.)The other thing about WotC mods -- it says it's for first level characters, but it lies: we had 6 of 'em (plus a wolf) in our party and had to rest and heal 22 hours/day. When we finished the end run as level 2s -- which took *hours* and involved a ranged-dice attack on the DM -- we only had half of the party left standing [less the wolf], one of them with 1 HP. The short of it is that it's only for first level characters if the DM is a complete sadist."
3,Solid.....but Boring.,"Essentialy a Dungeon hack with few plot twists or truly intresting developments. A good introduction to D&D if your a novice GM, but nothing to truly write home about."
2,"Under sized, Under written and over price","This is the first attempt of wizard of the coast to use their new 3rd Edison. After taking over TSR. First of all the 3rd Edison is by it self-a great start solving a lot of the problems with the previous addition, but the is a miserable start as a module. There are so many problem it hard to know where to start. It is under size and has little info in it. Now there were rumors of this being a new greyhawk module, but I can kind no placement to anywhere in greyhawk I am aware of. The story takes place in Oakhurst. The only Oakhurst I know of is Oakhurst California which maybe where it takes place for all I know. I know the argument of ""You can move it anywhere you like"". Well I say tell me where it is and I will move it if I want to. The question is it part of the greyhawk drama or not. It's not so greyhawk fan stay away."
5,Great adventure for beginning players,"I used to play D&D; many moons ago (and, no, I'm not going to tell you just how many, but it was a lot). I now have teenagers who wanted to try it. This adventure was a GREAT teaching module for my kids and their friends. It has pit traps, trapped doors, ambushes, riddles, more than one way through the dungeon, bits of treasure all over, and many different types of monsters. Beginning players CAN get through with hack 'n' slash, but they will be healthier (and richer) with a little thought and planning (and, duh, using Listen and Search, before and after entering a room and fighting a battle).I found this adventure very well crafted (and I enjoyed the little bits of humor included for the DM). I think players of any experience level would enjoy it and new players would find it a very good way to start."
3,Decent Starter Adventure,"This will allow you to start a 3rd ed campaign without too much setup. First first time GM's these ""canned"" adventure will help you not fall into the common traps (too much treasure, too hard monsters, not enough treasure, characters running away with the campaign). It will allow you to focus on the game and not on the ""fighting"" with the players that tends to happen when a campaign starts to fall apart. Here you have a good working point to build upon later. Note: This is a basic dungeon though. Nothing fancy."
4,B.S.,"Don;t ever ask me to write another review,this is the only part of getting some thing from ya'll that I didn't like!!!"
4,A good start,"As adventures go this one isn't bad. Alot are very poor. But for the first one released it is pretty good. Their is a little back story, a small town to add some flavour and another place to visit and use in games. A new monster and it's a good way to learn the rules. If all their adventures are of this standard then they will be alot of fun and well worth picking up to play."
3,it's alright,"This video has a combination of both natural scenes in the park(including animals) and history/information, but 2/3 of the time was spent on history(showing reproduction of old B&W prints, etc) and interviews(random people), which for me it's unnecessary information. The other 1/3 are decent video cam of the park and the animals, I wish all 50 minutes were video cam of the park and animals though."
1,A Disappointment :(,This product don't work like it is advertised. It barely vibrates for a few seconds then stops. The papers that came with the product states that you are supposed to gently pull on the spring inside the product to make sure it is making contact with the battery. After doing that I had no results. The paper work enclosed also says that it should be watched for over heating. It is a complete waste of money. However it is discretly packaged. That is the only plus about this product. I'd give it a negative rating if possible.
5,Wonderfully good time to be had by listening to this...,"I found this at an estate sale recently. For less than a dollar. Mint condition. Never heard of the artist, but I like Benny Goodman and his band members and arrangers. These are Goodman's arrangements but with the imaginative contributions of the current players. Great driving music, worth repeat listening, and a lot of tracks on here as well. You'll have to pay more than I did, but it will be worth it."
3,Good Player...not Great!,"I like this player...it does work really well. It is very easy to use and the sound is pretty good. The reason that this player got a 3 rating is the effectivness of the battery power. This thing eats up batteries like you would not believe!!! The thing of it is...I dont use it that much. I think that if there was a player out there that offered better battery power...I would choose that one instead. A plus on this one, it does include an AC adapter. I will keep this player for as long as it works..."
1,Just Don't,"Give it to your wife/girlfriend, and then just forget about anything while she tries to untangle it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Really, back here in 10 minutes. She's still working on it. It came in a little sack and is a jumbled mess. Read the other review. It's little.You'd be nuts to order this. Wish I could give it -6. Glad I didn't wait till Christmas.Well, it's another half-hour. She's still at it, and won't let me send it back. My first apprehensive shot at ordering jewelry from Amazon, I will never again.This just in: back it all goes!! What a waste."
3,More farce than mystery,"Miss Melville does indeed return, and is as witty and sincere as she was in the original. Unfortunately, her supporting cast doesn't live up to her high standards. Jill, her agent, is just not credible enough for her role in Miss Melville's life, and Alex has lost a lot of his charm. Other characters introduced in the original have not been fleshed out to the extent that made ""Miss Melville Regrets"" a virtuoso perfomance. The story holds together despite these failings. The plot, especially as regards deceased artist extraordinaire Darius Moffet, is undeniably a farce, yet plausible in the New York art scene Smith depicts. Overall a good story, despite the weakness of the characterizations."
5,THIS IS A ROCK AND ROLL JOY RIDE,"The daddy of rock and roll is so overlooked, the man is rock, he can spit out more incredible rock and roll quotes in an album than Peter Kriss(kiss) can in a lifetime. truly an amazing album by an amazing human being."
1,The worst CD I have ever heard,"This is the dumbest thing I have ever heard and I can't believe someone actually recorded this. I have a pretty good sense of humor, but a guy with a Casio keyboard doing nothing but yelling out the names of famous rock bands is not funny. It is just dumb."
1,dissatisfied with shade,I did not know this product would be so dark. I though natural was lighter. But this definitely should have been labeled as dark not natural.
2,Difficult to apply.,"Very thick, sticky and comes off on clothing. I should not have purchased it. I would not purchase it again."
1,Waste of money.,The color shades in website are identical to the real products.Can't cover scars and causes fine lines.Have to throw it away.
3,Looks Cakey,"I went to the Dermablend counter at a Dillards store and got the right shade for my skin tone. The products is perfect for my skin tone, and I use it on my legs. It hides all the blemishes pretty well, but the skin appears cakey. It definitely looks like I am wearing make-up on my legs."
4,GREAT product.,"Felt the need to review after reading several negative reviews about this product. This product actually works very well!! It doesn't smudge, it's water-resistant and sweat-resistant. My legs have never looked more flawless! The key though is to shave, exfoliate, and cover your legs well with moisturizer to avoid having the cakey look. I played with the colors in stores first before buying it, so I didn't have a bad experience with ordering the wrong shade.The only reason why I didn't give this product the full 5 stars is that the only way to quickly fully remove the this product through using the Dermablend makeup remover, otherwise it's a bit of a hassle to remove."
3,Covers SOME flaws..but not all,Okay I have the DEEEEEP stretchmarks...as well as the very light ones that do not look so bad....well this cover up did not cover either one....it just makes the light ones look shiny up close but if I was to stand far away they would look great....but whos doing that? the deep ones looked horrible...the color of the marks just pierced through...I know that the foundation does no change skin texture but since my marks are like scars I thought it would cover them.....it is suppose to cover scars and marks....I will NOT purchase again.....IT is water proof though.....and it DOES COVER TATOOS VERY WELL....But it does not work for the purpose that I anticipated.
3,Waxy,I bought the product in the fair color and it seems a little too light for my skin. My legs look kind of waxy. Maybe a darker color would be a better choice for me.
2,leg and body for tattoos,"Bought this product to cover up a tattoo. It's no good, too liquid. For a really full coverage I recommend the full cover cream from the same brand."
4,too dry but stays put,"i have terrible skin, lots of scars, stretch marks, burns, bruises, acne, etc. but people always come up to me & comment on how beautiful my skin is (due to the makeup). dermablend is way too dry(i like to mix it with a little lotion before applying) but it stays on even in water. if it looks a bit flaky/pale/ghostly put some lotion over it. any type of makeup looks bad if you don't know how to apply it. DUH!"
1,Beauty Bridge is not the company to buy the product from!,"My issues are not with the product itself but with the company Beauty bridge which did not deliver the product. I have spent a month trying to work out why I have not yet recieved the item(s) I purchased. Beauty Bridge has not been helpful at all. Additionally, I have been shopping with Amazon for nearly 5 years, and have never experienced this problem. I had to go into a store and purchase the product a second time and at addtional cost. The product is effective I only wished Amazon had a more reputable dealer selling the product than beauty bridge. Buyers beware!!!!!"
3,Very difficult to match product to skin,"I bought this to cover veins on my legs, and while the product is fairly effective- and DEFINITELY does not run or fade away until you wash in shower with rag- it's nearly impossible to match the shade based on swatches shown online. I'd recommend buying from a store such as Ulta so you won't have to bother returning it- and if you do buy online, DON'T go through Beauty Bridge- I had to beg to return the first one even though it was unused and my attempt occurred within 24 hours of receipt."
2,Like Clay,I received my order and was very dissapointed. The skin tones online are deceiving. I ordered the medium and it appears like clay and ashy. Doesn't blend well with skin. Suggest you order a darker color to match your skin tone.
3,coverage,"It does Ok, I have scars that I try to cover but you can still see them after the product is put on."
2,Cakey and gross,"This item was fine when it came to pictures; tattoos were not visible on film for the first part of our wedding. However I was told by a few of the guests that it looked like I had been in a fight before the wedding... make-up should not look like bruises!The make-up also started to fade not long after the ceremony ended, and it was a short ceremony. By the end of the reception (four hours later) you could clearly see the tattoos.Also, I was told that the make-up would not rub off onto clothing if I used the special setting powder together with the cream... Not true. I now have make-up stains on one of my brides maids dresses.I realize now that I should have just let the tattoos show. Why have a tattoo if you're not willing to show it off?"
4,Works well but on the light side,This product worked pretty well for me. It's good for covering spider veins and gave my legs a more even look.The only downside is that it's a bit light and I had to go a shade darker than I thought.If you use it like it tells you to (put moisturizer on before) it goes on evenly.It does rub off on clothes though if you don't let it set for a while.
5,Eminem is a genius,"I have always loved Eminem because I think the way he puts words into a rap are amazing. This movie not only displays his rap skills, but his acting skills as well. I really enjoyed this movie for several reasons. First and foremost because it stars Eminem, second it contains drama and comedy. The rap battles are incredibly funny and witty. I saw this movie at the theatre and am leaving now to go buy it at the store since it was released today. Even people who do not like Eminem's music will enjoy this movie."
3,Good,"This movie was okay, espicially if you consider that the lead role was played by Eminem. Now, I am a supporter of em's, but none the less he is a rapper, not an actor. Maybe i'm just jealous of all the money he is making, I dont know.. Anyway, ..., there are not enough battle scenes and the storyline is very vauge... I really was looking forward to seeing this movie, ...I was bored halfway though... Go watch it, but dont get too excited for you might be let down like this fan."
4,Watch this movie even if you're no rap fan,"I was never a rap or Eminem fan, but this movie changed my perspective on both. Thanks to youtube where I saw a small part of the movie - after that I rented it and then bought it. The most striking idea I got from the movie is how true talent and genius can be found even among what appears to be the ""rock bottom"". ""Beauty in disharmony"". If for nothing else, the movie is worth watching for the scene where Rabbit cares for and protects his little sister."
4,Not as bad as some reviews might have you think...,"Most people's enjoyment of a movie depends on their expectations: if you've expected a masterpiece & gotten something that doesn't meet your criteria of a good film, you'll be disappointed, even if the movie itself isn't so bad in any other way. If you're expecting a bad movie & discover a few unexpected good things in it (such as acting, for instance), you'll enjoy it far more than expected.'8 miles'may not be a masterpiece and may not be that original, plot wise. But it does expose people who were unaware of certain aspects of life in the neighborhoods this movie shows. Many people see some character & plot points as cliches - but these cliches are often based on real life truths...Eminem is a surprisingly good actor, and the rap parts are enjoyable even for people who are not devoted fans of the genre."
2,8 Mile Review,"This movie wasn't as great as everyone says it was. I think there could have been a whole lot more written to the movie. The ending of the movie wasn't too good. I was kinda disappointed at the end of the movie. I think there could have been a better ending written. I would say the movie was fair. I think that if you never seen it, to rent it before you buy it, because you might feel the same way I do about that movie. If I would have seen it in theather's, I would haven't boughten cuz I didn't like it that much. Although, I am a big eminem fan, I just didn't think his movie was that gr8."
3,"Great Movie, first time through","If You like rap, which I do... This movie is great. Eminem is suprisingly a great actor, and who better to play the part of himself. Actually the film is based only loosely on his life, but none the less he delivers a strong preformance and a great movie. If you dont own this, dont worry, this was all written after my first time seeing it, knowing everything first makes it mediocore a couple times thru."
5,8 MILE OUTSTANDING,"Emmien shows his flexabilty as an actor as well as a rapper, for his first film he looked like he was trying to explain what he went through to get to where he is now, a dream come true. Excellent!!!"
5,8 Mile,"YOU KNOW IM TIRED OF PEOPLE SAYING THAT THIS MOVIE WAS A BAD MOVIE AN THIS AN THAT.......ITS OBVIOUS YOU DONT KNOW WHAT HIP-HOP IS ALL ABOUT....OR WHAT HIP HOP IS....YOU OBVIOUSLY DONT UNDERSTAND WHAT IT IS TO STRUGGLE FOR A DREAM THATS SO UNSURE ...EMINEM WAS GREAT IN THE MOVIE,THE BATTLES WERE GREAT AS WELL....AN IM SURE HIP HOP LOVERS WOULD LOVE THIS MOVIE......"
3,he looked like a guy who could surely do with some sleep.,"This movie is really not as bad as i percieved a typical rap hip hop stereo typical movie,i must admit that this movie had a reasonable and predictable story line it's like i heard it all before! but i must say that eminem can act and kim bassinger was really great in this movie, i dont know but to me all the white folks look like they had lots of sleepless nights, maybe it's just me? it kinda had white trash feel to it, the mood of the movie kinda had a hopeless i want to commit suicide aura, (trivial) but none the less it was entertaining i say it's definitely worth a watch cast you own opinions laterz folks."
2,"A cliched, boring, predictable movie","The acting is deplorable. Eminem has 2 forms - Angry and violent and angry and thoughtful. This is a man's Cinderella story - rags to riches- Oh, the oppression! As if he was some tortured artist with a real message.The main problem with the hype surrounding this movie is that it misleads you into thinking that what you are seeing is something original, something that has not been done a thousand times before. It promises us that the film will be frighteningly realistic and distrubing, with performances so honest, because much of it is Eminem's so-called life story.The ending is so predictable you just wait there bored, waiting for it to eventually get there, and hoping that just maybe the film will surprise you along the way. It never does. This film is an embarrassment to film making!"
1,It's like a serious version of 'Cool as Ice',"I had to sit and suffer through this movie because I was at a party where I unfortunately wasn't driving. The only redeeming qualities about this movie is when Eminem gets the crap kicked out of him, his retarded friend shooting himself, and the over-all terrible acting. It's funny because you get the vibe that they were really trying to make this a serious account when it couldn't be any further from the truth. I've said it before and I'll say it again, I never liked Eminem and I never will. I resent the fact that he's considered by ""rap"" fans (really just 12 year old girls and boys) as the best ever, that's b.s. The funny thing is, he didn't even write the battle raps in his own movie! Craig G did! Any true hip hop fan knows that he is a phony and over rated (I'd be lying if I didn't say he had TALENT, but TALENT does not always mean GOOD) Anyone who knows Detroit rap history knows that this is predominantly a hokey story."
1,8 miles from da ghettoville!,If your into white trailer trash wigger poser tough guy stuff or just feel sympathy for a white trailer trash loser who just didn't seem to have a perfect life then this gimmick of a saga movie is recommended just for all you white trash bedwetters out there who just want to become black and start living the fantasy of a gangsters paradise WORD!. This movie was so incredibly retarded they should have played this just on mtv never on VH1. Why did this movies price dropped to 1 cent on amazon? because this movie was stupid as hell eminem didn't really have a hard life his life was not perfect and who's idea was it to have britteny muphy to play as kim and kim basinger to play as eminems mommy *cough mommas boy! cough*. It's a shame that alot of people eat it from talentless guys like eminem who plague the world with thier so called music.
3,Pretty Good Formula,"this Movie Reminded me of ""Saturday Night Fever"",""Flash Dance""&""Purple Rain"" all Rolled into One.Eminem has a Screen pressence but the Film is choppy in spots&takes on a bit to much but the Performances work."
4,8 Mile,8 Mile was one of the best movies i have ever seen. It shows a different side of Eminem. People who have bad ratings about this movie must of had popcorn in their eyes or something. The movie was packed with great action and outstanding rap scenes. I hope Eminem makes another one!
4,Much ado about something,"I agree that the main reason this movie is getting negative attention is that Eminem is in it. This movie was great. My only complaint was Brittany Murphy's gratuitous role. If she was taken out, no one would miss her. She was only there for the sex scene.Other than that, I was very very impressed. While I think Eminem is obviously a troubled individual, this film succeeds in explaining why he is the way he is. I can't wait until he grows a little more and decides to get on with his life, but hey, he's ranting all the way to the bank, so more power to him. This IS a free country, and I salute Eminem for saying everything he wants.To the skeptics: go see the movie and pretend it's not Eminem on the screen. If you have any sense of what's good and what's not, you'll agree that it's worth seeing."
3,Love this White Boy,"I love Eminem, with his controversy baby! Doesn't that keep you more interested?I loved the rap-off's man it made you reflect on when rapping really hit the scenes how heated it was and not deadly!I liked the movie his compassion for his sister, and his hope for himself as well as his mom. He didn't try and come with a rags to riches tale and I believe that is what cinched it for me.Okay I did get lost, who is the one that is suppose to be his wife????? The one he left or Britany's character?????"
1,Will the real Slim Shady please shut up?,"To me, Eminem's music is boring, aggravating, poseur schlop. This movie is no better. This, along with xXx (aka zZz) and the Fast and the Furious (aka the Slow and the Timid), go under the category of brain-dead flavor-of-the-week ""cinema"". I quote a reviewer of Fast and the Furious: ""Is this what 100 years of filmmaking has led up to?"" It's not even worthy of any more of a review."
3,8 Mile Review,"WOW! Where to begin? Marshal playing jimmy, Growing up in a tough neighbour hood where you had to be ""it"" to be in. This movie showed the viewers how it was for marshal (Eminem) growing up in detroit. The movie was good but lacked in some of the important aspects. When the movie finished i thought to myself, is that it? It kind of left you with an uncertainty. It has alot of sex and violence in it, which is really what eminem is about, I rate it 3 stars, no higher."
3,"Hmmm, very interesting","Isn't it funny how every person who gave this movie under 3 stars clearly never saw it? Every 1 or 2 star review just rants about how Eminem is bad for society or some crap like that having nothing to do with how well the plot was created or anything directly related to 8 Mile.It's sad, really. I pity people like that."
3,is this movie worth it?,i think this movie is well worth the money. especially because of the ending. the last battles are AWESOME!!! get this movie and you'll enjoy it
5,Eminem rules and his movie is off the hook!!,"I got this movie for my birthday last May, and I gotta say that this movie is one of my favorites! Eminem is one of my favorite rappers and when I heard that he had a movie coming out about his life, I just had to see it. The film is about a young rapper trying to start out his career while having to live with his poor mother in a trailer park in a bad part of town. It's about his struggles and triumphs, a story based on Marshall's actual life. This movie is awesome!!"
2,Run Rabbit Run,"If you've seen the movie and you liked it, the dvd makes it 4 times as good with all the extras. My mistake was buying the dvd for the movie before I saw it. I was able to get into that unautherized biography of Eminem, but this movie was boring. It is cheap though, and for a fan the last scene of the movie was awsome."
5,Awesome,"Eminem's acting debut is phenomenal. He plays Jimmy aka Rabbit, a struggling rapper who lives in the ghetto of Detroit. When I heard of this movie, I thought another musician gone bad movie, but it's definately not. The story is great, almost a biography about Em's life. He works at the local steel plant during the day, and battles his rhymes (when he doesn't chicken out) at night. Kim Basinger plays his alcoholic mother. Overall, 8 Mile was definately one of the greatest movies of 2002."
5,Truely Amazing,wow... I saw this movie and was soo surprised of how well it was. There are alot of triple threats out there but none even come close to Eminem. This movie blew me away by how good of an actor he is and how well the movie was. Its a great movie.. one that I could watch over and over unlike soo many other movies. Its soo amazing I would tell anyone who loves Eminem as much as i do to go see it you'll be BLOWN away! Best movie I've seen in years!!!
2,"Eminem's ok, but the movie is a let down","its let down by its sense that, ok, hes a rapper trying to fit in and have a good life but thats basically what we see, rapping, but theres the reason of in the end of course he's gonna outrap the people and of course this is somewhat based on his life, but Hanson does a good job with Eminem's reason for his family and thats what really brought this to a two star movie rather then a 1 star movie. Mehki Phifer with dreadlocks dont cut it as well. Murphy is annoying as Eminem's girl and Basinger trys her best but cant cut it. all in all im sticking with what I told and im staying there. plus its let down also by that guy who shoots himself, hes so boring. it was like I was sitting there and when ever something stupid would come on id try to go but then right after a good thing would ome on and id stay and thats what is was like when I watched"
5,Nice Job.,"This movie was outstanding. Eminem does a good job in his debut and lead role as B Rabbit. From director Curtis Hanson (L.A. Confidential) this movie is about Rabbit trying to make his way out of 8 mile mobile court. His mom is a drunk with no job, and her boyfriend is a loser. Rabbit is very concerned about his kid sister. He works at a factory and is going nowhere. He meets a girl (Brittany Murphy) and likes her. He does rap battles in hopes of a record deal. Alright, enough about the plot, I don't want to ruin it. What made this movie so good, was the comedy aspect of it. It's set in a ghetto, and Rabbit and his friends are poor, but their so funny, I laughed so hard when Cheddar Bob shot himself by accident, and the fat guy is a riot, he constantly makes hilarious jokes. I suggest you rent this at the LEAST.PEACE."
5,AMERICA'S CRITIC,OUTSTANDING PERFORMANCES RAPPER AND ACTOR IM READY FOR 8 MILES AND WALKING!!!!! GET TO MAKING IT ITS ABOUT TIME!!!! THIS MOVIE IS ALWAYS ENTERTAINING! ITS A MUST HAVE
5,"My pick for ""Best Picture""","8 Mile proves that Eminem is a double threat.He can act and he can rap.This film focuses on Jimmy Smith (a.k.a Eminem) a.k.aRabbit.A rapper who has stage fright.His Mom (Kim Basinger) plays the typical alcholic mom,who has a boyfriend who is the same age as Jimmy.Heart touching and violent this movie deserves more than it got.If I was in charge of the Oscar Ceremony,then this is my pick for ""Best Picture"",""Best Actor"" Eminem,Best Supporting Actor Mekhi Phifer,and Supporting ActressKim Basinger.Bottom Line:Walk This Mile"
1,It was good until I matured,"When I first saw this movie, I liked Eminem and his music. This was before Lose Yourself become a hit and his 3rd cd came out. I cant stand this movie anymore because it made me realize Eminem is out for sympathy and money from his fans, and they'd eat the crap that comes from ass. Eminem fans are sick, people who worship and like him are the dumbest people on the planet. He had talent and wasted it on a film about how hard his life was, even has 50 Cent's life story coming to a theater near you! Im so sick of Em and his life story, its been over played and so many other artist have suffered worse then Eminem. Who cares about the thousands of artist who suffered worse then Eminem in there life but they keep there mouth shut and dont release it to the public for money like Eminem does."
3,I just wasn't feeling it,"For some reason I just couldn't get into the story line. The rap battles were good, but for some reason I didn't want to like it. I love Eminem, and he is a good actor, don't get me wrong, but I just couldn't feel the movie..."
5,Wow,"I don't know how to put into words the excitment i felt after seeing this film. If you have read about Eminem aka. Slim Shady aka. Marshall Mathers, then you would see how wonderfully well this depicts the vision you might see while reading his auotbiography. He is a great inspiration. What most people have to do is look past what you think he depicts, and read between the lines.And as far as his 15minutes dieing out 2 years ago. Don't think so...This man has a lot going for him..His a real person who is not trying to be someone he isn't. And I give him all the credit in the world...And what a great actor!!..See the movie, you'll enjoy it till the end, and go home inspired.."
2,WOW...........NOT.,"Who is watching this stuff and giving it so much praise. I fell for all the hype, sucker. There is simply some good acting on eminem's behalf here but the the movie it self sucks. Much more could have came out of a story like this. Hell I've been in plenty of gang fights my self and I know that after that many guys jump you, you end up with more than a black eye. My point, it just doesn't feel real at all. I'm sure Mr. Eminem had a ruff life, as so do many people who live in the ghetto, but there has to be a better way to tell it."
1,"Not Since ""Cool as Ice"" - 8 Mile the Ultimate ""Heckeling""","I love this movie, but for the wrong reasons.I loved the way the movie was sooooo cheesy. It was great from beginning to the end. Even the music was corny.I definitely recommend this movie for anyone who wants a great belly laugh. Highly Recommended, but still gets my very good ""so-bad-it's-good"" one star!!! Love, Love, Love it! Can't wait for the sequel: 8 1/2 miles."
1,Truly a disappointment,"I am truly amazed at the number of good reviews and hype this movie got. Eminem should just stick to music,a nd please, no more horrid sex scenes! The best part of this movie was the ending."
1,Garbage,"What is the world coming to? To watch this poor excuse for a movie is to feel ashamed to be a member of the human race. M&M's character has a lousy life and an alcoholic mother, but is that any reason to turn to rap music? This movie has no plot, little acting, lousy, stilted dialogue and all-in-all is a load of unmitigated garbage. I feel sorry for those who worked on this picture. Now they've got it on their resume. You know what I'm saying??!!"
1,8 Mile SUCKS,"This movie sucked. Eminem sucks at everything he does. His 'music', if it can even be called that is just pointless ranting and everything and everyone that has done him wrong. Worthless actor, worthless rapper, worthless person. DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE! It is a waste of money."
2,Why ?,"8 MILE, Was somewhat of a good movie. I thought the movie was trying to be too much of ""PURPLE RAIN"". I think Enimen wasn't even acting, if this was a somewhat of a true story then he really wasn't acting he just playing himself. The soundtrack is just awful except that one song they play all the time. The ending was dull."
5,it has eminem it has to rock,"i havent seen it but if it has em,inem it has to rock and it will be my fave i really respect the guy. he helps cause i can relate. im not that bad off though. but i know how it feels to feel hated against. shut out from others. crazy. i just know hes my heo thank u em! the movie i cant wait for. somebody plese help me or ill go crazy. itsvtaking to long to come out. im seein it the first day. and by the way i wish he was coming back to st louis. i couldnt get tickets to the first one. im such a big fan i tell everyone hes my cuz. i love u marshall."
5,All signs point to a Winner,"This movie is fantastic, i could sit here and tell you all my favorite parts.... but i wont.... all i'll tell you is as someone who's not even a huge rap fan or one of eminems in general..... this movie rocked..... definately worth buying before renting...."
3,Not Horrible ** 1/2,"Eminem was actually pretty good in this film, and I am not a fan. The story was cheezy. I guess you have to be a big rap fan to really get into it. Kim Basinger seemed out of place. I said the same thing when I saw her in one of the most terrible films I have ever seen,""Bless the Child"". It was soo bad! I am usually a fan of Brittany Murphy, but I thought she played a stupid role. Because of her newly found fame, I feel she has lost that spark that she once had in her previous films. 8 Mile is definately a teenager movie, it was not made to appeal to adults! But before you let your youngster see this film, be advised that there are a couple of racy sex scenes, violence and lots of foul language! The film is also very dark and gloomy. I really wanted to hate 8 Mile because of all of the Eminem hype, but overall, it wasn't that horrible. To the Eminem fan, you will enjoy him in this film."
1,movie would not download. Buffering issues,Movie would not download. It was very frustrating to watch. It would buffer every few minutes. Ended up going to VuDu. Had no problems there at all. So we ended up paying twice for the same movie.
1,wrong product,Received the wrong movie. Wrote three times to try and correct it with no success. Finally gave up. The feedback process is to involved.
5,I just can't wait...,"I really just can't wait to see this movie. From the reviews and the trailer, it looked so good. As a huge Eminem fan, I really can't wait!! He looks like he made a really good performance. Everyone should go and see it."
5,100 STARZ- THIS IS THE BEST MOVIE EVER,"this is the best movie ever with one of the best rappers ever-Eminem-starring in it. it also stars Meki Phifer (i dont know how to spell it). Proof from D12, Obie Trice,& Xzibit all have a cameo in it. everyone should go see it. its the best MOVIE EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!also check out the soundtrack"
2,"Eminem can act, as long as he's playing a rapper.","He won awards for this? I mean, come on! That's like giving Adam Sandler an award for being Adam Sandler. Basically you hear profanity every 3 seconds. His mom calls him bunny-rabbit because of his teeth and thats why he hates her. Big-deal. Go watch American Beauty, Goodfellas, Scarface, or This is Spinal Tap instead of this."
3,Good,"This movie was okay, espicially if you consider that the lead role was played by Eminem. Now, I am a supporter of em's, but none the less he is a rapper, not an actor. Maybe i'm just jealous of all the money he is making, I dont know.. Anyway, besides seeing his ..., there are not enough battle scenes and the storyline is very vauge... I really was looking forward to seeing this movie, I went ... and still I was bored halfway though... Go watch it, but dont get too excited for you might be let down like this fan."
3,8 mile,i liked the movie because it made me sad but it also made me laugh. i didnt like the ending. The movie was not as hot as i thought it would be. (see it yourself). i would have waited to see it on video.Movie could have been better. Not the best. I can say Em is a good actor.
1,Simply Bad,"Picked up this movie after hearing all the praises and decided to find out what all the fuss was about. Simply put, this movie is simply aweful, the editing job of the film was horrible and there were some scenes in which made me go ""what the hell was that?"" What made it worse was that I didn't like the overall character that Eminem plays...simply put the main hero is just a wuss. The rap battles were alright and there were quite a few...but made me realize that the rap battles were all scripted just for the movie, which loses the credibility in when these rappers spit out their dissing rhymes. Spend your money elsewhere."
2,Yawn,"I'm a pretty big Brittney Murphy fan and I like Eminem well enough so I was optimistic going into this movie. What a let down and it justn't isn't because I'm not jiggy wit it either. This film just tanked all around and short of fire, I don't know what could have saved it. I just couldn't bring myself to give a Brittney Murphy movie 1 star. Maybe you might like it, but I doubt it."
3,Okay...nothin special though,"I like this movie but then again i don't. It's just a story about a guy having a dream to have a record deal--or to just win the rap battle and he FINALLY at the end fufills those dreams. No big fairy tale. But watch it, you might find it more interesting than I did."
2,"Bunny Wabbitz is played out, YKWIS?","Can you believe M&M was bandied about for an Oscar nod for this? That would have been COLD, Vanilla. I was almost embarrassed to hate this film because it's actually too much of a joke; a vanity piece NOT to be taken serious. My eyes rolled back every time Kim Basinger appeared on screen. What a sad choice she made taking this part, but as actresses age, well, you sometimes have to take what you can get - that's the cold, ugly truth. And what about Em's ""co-stars"". Did the director tell each of them: ""Alright, now in every scene that you appear with B.Wabbitz you have to act a fool - that is, obsequious and fawning beyond all measure, because you know, he's M&M"". I give it 2 stars for interesting cinematography and that's it."
4,PRETTY GOOD FIRST PERFORMANCE,"This movie turned out to be a whole lot better than I thout it was going to be. In most movies that star rappers the rappers usually over play their role and try to be super hard, in this movie Eminem played it pretty cool and turned out a great performance.The extras on this DVD are top notch, the battles, the music video,and all of the music in the movie are all available. Good stuff."
2,Too Many Sick-Looking People In This Film,"As I was watching this movie, I noticed that there were a lot of sick-looking people. The majority were 'blacks' and one 'white' guy. I don't understand why they didn't pick healthy actors. They seemed really sick. Also, I felt Mekhi Phifer's hairstyle was horrible. It was very distracting. I would change this movie for something else, but after 24hrs there are no refunds or exchanges from the store. On a lighter note, if you love hip hop you might like this film."
3,Surprise Comedy!,"Toastmasters has nada on this form of extemporaneous speaking skills forum and what a display of talent, those lyrics played off like a second city free for all, found the drama comedic, exciting, witty and truly entertaining... so hard to believe that the weapons used in this horrid detroit suburb are showdown putdowns, was used to this growing up in a low class neighborhood but singing on stage and rhyming, that's pure talent! the evil fearful glares made for some pretty scary confrontations and thank goodness the drama relief came in the form of a gun or two for thugalicious certification.... Eminem was trif and wow would I not fit in with this crowd, prefer Rachmaninov but enjoyed this delighful diversion!"
3,Not Bad,"First off, shipping was very quick (two days), so to pay more for a faster delivery is probably unnecessary. I'm a huge Eminem fan, and I think his acting was very good. Some things I liked were the way it starts off, and explains the setting very well. The rap battles at the end are perfect, but they are short and the film would have been better with more. Dislikes about the movie are the seemingly pointless events that go on towards the middle of the film. Overall, the movie was enjoyable, but for those who don't know Eminem's life story this film wouldn't make too much sense, as the main character, Rabbit, is very similar to Eminem and faces many challenges that the real-life singer did. For the price however, this is a great buy for those that may just want to add to their DVD collection."
2,8 mile,8 mile will take you about 105 minutes to watch it. For me these 105 min were way to long and I was glad the movie was finally over - even though the morale story (if it had one) wasn't that bad.It is a story of a young rap singer who defeats his anger and obstacles through music.I didn't like it (almost) at all! Even Kim Basinger and cute Brittany Murphy don't look the same.
2,Disappointing,"What's the difference between this film and ""Cool As Ice"" starring Vanilla Ice? This film has a better soundtrack. The only redeeming quality of it, is that there's a catchy tune during the end credits. The plot went nowhere, and character development was very underdone.10 years from now, people will hear the plot of this film and scoff at it at the video store. A white guy trying to get respect by winning a ""rap battle."" Yes folks, a ""rap battle."" These gangstas don't use guns to take out the enemy, they use raps. What a ridiculous film. Eminem needs to stick to singing and stay away from serious endeavors such as acting. Although this film was so poorly directed and had such a laughable screenplay that it didn't matter how good the acting was."
2,Where's the plot,"I was not very impressed with this movie. Unless I am blind, I didn't see a plot to the movie and if there was one it was weak. Kim Bassinger's character was not as good as I know she can do. And to top it off the movie just ended, it's like we just saw a few days of Rabbit's life and that was it.I'm glad I borrowed this movie instead of paying money for it."
2,Awkward movie,"Eminem is not an actor, and though I give him credit for not ruining it by trying to act in the movie and instead being himself, he sticks out when put in a movie surrounded by actors. All other characters appear relatively vibrant, bordering on flamboyant... like actors in a movie. And he seems like he's just a pedestrian passing through. I think this is an example of a poor idea given to decent cinematographers, to project the movie's tension to the viewer.In the end is a movie with an awkward feel, and I don't feel like I gained anything watching this over, say, just reading his story online."
2,"Dark, marginally entertaining road to fame","Eight Mile is a stylish, gritty and often explicative-filled movie that is sorta interesting if you are into rap or Horatio Alger, or want to see Michael Shannon beaten to a pulp by a young Eminem or see Kim Bassinger as a drug addicted mother. Let it be said that Eminem is not much of an actor. Still, the movie is bleak, brisk and upwardly mobile enough but I wouldn't pay more than $3 for it."
4,Almost a groundbreaking movie,"Im not going to say much, but I will say this.Eminem has proven himself as an actor. Beyond that, he was proven his skill as a lyricist to anyone who is not really an eminem fan.Maybe Im mistaken, but this film trodded in uncharted territory. For years my friends and I had been infatuated with freestyle rapping (...). The movie made a solid story out of something that most of mainstream America doesnt know about.Lastly, this movie is the first film since the original Rockie that made me want to leave the theater and just let loose. The end is triumphant and pure cinematic genious. I could (and have) watched the movies final 15 minutes countless times over and over and over and over......(...)"
2,An Exercise in Endurance,"I picked up this movie at the library hoping to gain some insight into the world and music of Eminem. Unfortunately, you have to sit through an awful lot of movie before much music is shown - and the world is just too caricatured to be of much value. The pacing is *very* slow, which makes sense for some art house film where the characters are pontificating about the deeper meaning of life, but when it's just some delinquents driving around in a big sedan rattling off the various vices they're looking forward to exploring, it just gets a little tedious. I enjoyed watching the cutting contests, but seeing Kim Basinger slum it, and everybody else beat each other down and show very little respect just got old."
4,Eminem's big movie debut,"Eminem proves he is an outstanding actor and makes the story unquestionable.B. Rabbit is a noone with plenty of ambition as well as his vocabulary intact, but when you're growing up on 8 mile it's not easy becoming anything, less alone a white rapper. He can't even bring himself to challenge the local rappers on stage during the weekends. In the middle of him trying to land his breakthrough he finds himself fond of the ambitious, but ditsy Alex (Brittany Murphy), but she turns out to be bad news for him. Will he stand the challenge of the Free Worlds Gangsta Boys?It's a good storyline (nothing new, but you haven't seen it 10 times before either).Brittany Murphy disappoints in this movie if you've liked her previous movies. This is Eminem's acting debut, but not his autobiography. It just goes to show he can both sing and act and IS truly talented."
3,Baaaah...,"8 Mile is a good,bad film.Good because in the soundtrack therer are wonderful hip-hop songs like ""C.R.E.A.M."" of Wu-Tang Clan or ""Who Shot Ya"" of Notorious B.I.G.,and this film is probably the most influent film of 2002.Why?Because a lot of people have started to listen rap-music after they have seen ""8 Mile"".So why is bad?Becuase the story and the actors are not so magnificent like the OST:Eminem plays a kind of biography,I think it's not so impressive,and,for exaple,Brittany Murphy shows her baddest part. The most interesting moments of the film are ""fo'sure""freestyles,it's epic the free of Rabbit VS Mike (Xzibit,west coast rapper).A film dedicated to rap music and ghetto life."
3,That's it?,"I found this movie to be somewhat underwhelming. I won't spoil it, but it doesn't have much of a climax. It would have been more interesting to see Rabbit move past the battles."
3,What was all the hype for???,"I know that I'm going to get a lot of crap from the ever loyal eminem fans out there - but I didn't see the appeal of this movie. It's been told a million times before - young guy from the wrong side of the tracks trying to make something of himself and get the hell out of dodge. I've heard over and over again about how amazing Eminem's acting is - he is pretty good in the movie... but come on - anyone can act out their life. I say give him a challenge. Put him in the role of a gay guy living in the upper east side and see how good of an actor he really is! Anyway, the movie isn't horrible- it's even worth watching once. But it was predictable, somewhat boring, and uneventful. The only outcome of the ending is that he was able to beat the other guy in the rap-off. He didn't get a record contract, he didn't get the girl, he didn't get out of dodge. It was disappointing."
3,"Good story, [weak] acting, eminem rules, soft plot","8 Mile is the inspirational story of Jimmy ""B-Rabbit"" Smith, Jr., whose life revolves around fighting each day with his unstable, alcoholic mother (kim basinger in her worse, yet entertaining performance), taking care of his little sister, and overcoming his greatest fear: stage fright. This movie really loses its plot from the end of the first shelter sequence, and may be the most boring movie ever made, however the last half-hour make up for [weak], sparse action, a plot that has no solid ground, some [weak] performances [...], and mediocre directing all in all. Well done, interesting scenes throughout however, may keep you on your seat, and i do not see why eminem wasn't at least nominated for an oscar. The film won best song ""Lose Yourself"" 2003, and for any die-hard eminem fan, this movie is surely a winner, anyone else...well... in EM we trust to make it worth watching."
5,Highly Anticipate -- And I Used to Hate Eminem,"I can't say that this is going to be a bad movie. With the release of ""The Eminem Show,"" we're all waiting for this film. An awesome soundtrack is sure to follow with another release of ""Cleaning Out My Closet,"" one of the better tracks, though widely commercialized. Eminem's surfacing musicality and the heartfelt-looking trailers for the film should make for a well-spent [$$$]"
1,LAME!!!,"The only thing lamer than this movie...his music. Don't waste your time or energy on this one. No substance whatsoever. The acting was terrible, even Kim Bassinger's part as the mom was horribly acted. The Doors...now that's a movie."
2,great film,"i love this movie, being from detroit, and i couldn't wait to get it. luckily the shipping didn't take to long and it arrived in good shape. i think this is an important film that really does reflect what its like to live in detroit. i had no problems with the seller, i can't emphasize that enough. though emminem isn't a great actor he comes across as at least believable. i would highly suggest this movie as one that can be enjoyed by all people."
5,"8 Mile, the best movie of all time!","Well, you've read the title, 8 Mile is the best movie of all time. It stars Eminem, & some other cool actors. This movie shows what it was like where Eminem grew up in the suburbs of Detroit. How he struggled, what he had to go through. This is a great movie for all Eminem fans, even non-Eminem fans will love this movie. I hope that Eminem plays in another movie sometime in the near future. Buy this movie, you'll love it!"
4,A surprisingly addictive tale ...,"We all knew that Eminem was talented. After all, he IS one of the all-time greatest MCs, arguably. But who knew he had acting chops?? Of course, being a huge Eminem fan, I hoped that he would do well and so he did. He generated many positive reviews and I hope this encourages him to do more film the future. He is truly an empire."
3,And the Academy Award goes to.....,"Who would have thought that Eminem would be such a great actor? In 8 Mile, the controversial rapper proves that he is multi-talented, a genius of music and the screen. However, he was really the only good part about this movie. I never really cared about the other characters and barely noticed them. Eminem really stole the show on this one. I think its time for another Eminem movie.Thanks America for this great import(Eminem)!"
5,Amazingly out of the ordinary!!,Aside form the fact that they're British which automatically makes them awesome. They are awesome. Their lyrics are totally bizarre but meaningful and the music is completely original and entrancing. I loved it.
3,They're all right...,"I guess it all depends on your style but in my opinion, they cut way too much. Previous reviewer says he uses them in jazz scenarios, but I find that the Bliss line of high-hats are far superior for jazz, and for most other types of playing except for rock i guess. If these are supposed to be all purpose professional cymbals, why are they so loud and crispy. I personally like a more malleable metal sound...a little more soft and creamy, with less contact sound."
5,A necesity for the beginner and veteran pageant competitor!,"It is all too easy to jump into pageant competition without learning what it takes to prepare. Secrets of Interview, Swimsuit, Talent and Evening Gown portions of competition are beautifully highlighted in this book to help contestants avoid mistakes. The importance of paperwork is not ignored either. If you're thinking about competing, I would definitely recommend reading this book from cover to cover at least once! If you've competed many times, this book is just as wonderful as it may point out things you never thought of as well as confirming that you are doing something right. In my opinion, this book is a must for the pageant competitor's library."
3,Good to know,"This book is all the basic knowledge any girl/woman entering a pageant should know. It has helpful tips and smart advice, but don't expect some secret inside information. It's all about hard work and mental attitude to win a pageant. This book helps you remember that all the little steps you take to preparing yourself, leads to bigger changes."
2,Not worthy of Farmer!,"Not one of his better works. Within this genre, this would lie somewhere in the lower half of all novels quality wise. The characters are one dimensional at best, and the writing and plot devices are appropriate for young teens at best.I felt cheated of the time I wasted reading this. An allegorical fantasy story, when skillfully written/told can be enjoyed by all ages and intelligence levels. Unfortunately, this is not one of those. The writing was cheap, the plot contrivances show little inventiveness or any reasonable thought behind them.Overall, I'd recommend you skip this and read Riverworld series instead."
5,Postal exam,This is an excellent study guide with key information to look for on the exam. I have not taken the exam yet but I am confident that I will score better as a result of reading this book and going through the exercises. I would recommend it.
5,Great Movie,"I loved this book and I think the movie is great also. When watching it please keep in mind American society of the 1950's. Most movies before Peyton Place ignored the underlying problems of small town life and presented a sugar-coated version of reality.This movie deals with problems such as child abuse and abortion in an era when these topics were barely whispered about.The filming of this movie is beautiful (much was filmed in Camden Maine). I also loved the musical score.Much of the cast, especially Lloyd Nolan and Russ Tamblyn hit the mark. The only minus is Lee Phillips he is too preachy and can't hold up the scenes he is in with Lana Turner.This is a great movie to get lost in on a cold winter day.Great Movie!"
3,Just okay,"I'm sure Peyton Place was a novel for it's time, especially with all its talk about teenage sex, domestic rape and a few other shocker thrown in, but it doesn't stand up to the test of time for this viewer. I kept one eye on the clock most of the time because it felt incredibly slow. A good part of that because this was orginally a television series and not a straight movie. The series does manage to get the nuisances of a small town down but to be honest I just wasn't riveted by this. So again I'm the odd woman out on this. View at your own risk."
3,Overrated Film,"Having heard all of my adult life about ""Peyton Place,"" I finally got around to checking out the DVD from the library and was majestically underwhelmed. This film is so loaded with fifties teenage angst and campy, bad acting that it was a trial for me to sit through. The best actor/actress in the whole production was Arthur Kennedy, who played his role as the drunken stepfather/rapist to the hilt. Although the story is supposed to take place during the early forties, nothing about the film seems to fit in that time frame except the automobiles. The entire production seemed contrived and was overblown, overracted, and boring.The beautiful scenes of Maine were the only redeeming feature."
2,Disappointing,"As a fan of classic films, I expected to love this movie, but was sorely disapointed. The score is great, and the direction isn't bad, either, but the writing is horrendous. Why must the characters stand around giving each other speeches? Michael Rossi, the new school prinicpal, is the worst. Every time he opens his mouth it's time to pull out the soapbox. Hardly a word of the dialogue in the movie is crisp or realistic. Dialogue such as ""In a way I've always felt that way, but I'm just now realizing it. . ."" pepper the entire film. That's a shame, too, because the story itself contains some daring elements, as well as some very promising characters, such as Allison's boyfriend."
2,Garishly Overwrought Soap Opera,"This is not a film that aged well. It might have been edgy iand salacious in its day, but contemporary audiences will find it melodramatic in an unintentionally funny manner...and full of cliches. Seriously, I was laughing out loud in parts that were meant to be serious.I gave this two stars instead of just one because the performances were, for the most part, good. The only reason to watch this movie is to see where the expression, ""Wow...[such-and-such] is becoming a regular Peyton Place!"""
3,"Lush setting, annoying plot",I know the scandalous novel was highly sanitized for the screen but the scenery and over the top performances led by a very prim and proper Lana Turner make for an amusing journey back in time. Beautiful photography of coastal Maine. Not exactly a classic but not a bad way to spend a couple of hours.
4,Hosting a Swinger Party?,"After I viewed the heady fare of ""My Dinner with Andre"", what better antidote than classic trashy melodrama where the morals are strict and the breasts pointy? Many giggle (and some laugh out loud) moments, but was glad to have noted it in the classic section at Blockbusters and wanted to knock off this much referenced work. I am in no way comparing this movie (1957) in quality with ""Splendor in the Grass"" (1961) but couldn't help but notice some similarities:- both utilize country fair to show off Americana (""PP"" New England vs. ""SIG"" Mid West) - both show faith in science/modern medicine - both show mental illness as result of duress - both have nifty necking scenes - both have high achieving female lead character - both have low achieving male lead character - both Technicolor high achieversOverall, great enjoyment, would be ideal video to play if hosting a swinger party. Grade A-/B+."
5,SEX OUTSIDE THE CITY.........,"HEAVILY 'doctored' by the Studio, this brilliant saga of small-town life predates the almost dated David Lynch excursions into Smallville, but still holds many a thrill today.Quite a lot of trash too and those taboo subjects! Splendid performances by ever-glamorous Lana Turner - this time as a mother with a little secret or two.....DIANE VARSI plays the daughter and 'tell-all' narrator. Yes, it's a coming of age tale centering around a high school senior class nearing graduation with WW11 looming, lots of unfairness in the little town too complete with gossips, rapists, abortionists, nude [or is it semi nude?] bathing? etc. You know - regular life!Oh, they certainly don't make them like this today. Would like to see cutting room footage on this one![Very worthy of mention? Hope Lange as the fragile, almost doomed Selena Cross - beautiful performance!]Highly recommended!"
3,"Interesting, well made soap opera from the fifties","Peyton Place (sometimes called Pagan Place by wagsters) was the King's Row of the fifties. It received a good production with an intelligent script, good performances, fine photography and music (Franz Waxman). Lana Turner emerged as a mature actress in this one. A good example of how Hollywood now and then treated sensational material with good taste and discretion. 3 1/2 stars."
2,Peyton Place video,The CD was damaged in the middle of the movie it did return to normal but we missed 15 minutes of the movie
4,Interesting bit of melodrama,"A less than ordinary town is displayed through the eyes of the diverse lives of the residents. Ahead of its time then and contains thought-provoking moments, but it might not connect with viewers today. A disappointing conclusion it has, but Lana Turner is a real standout."
3,Peyton Place - A Watered Down Version of the Book,"I expected to much from this movie. The only actors that appealed to me were Lana Turner as Connie McKenzie and Lorne Greene as the prosecutor.The movie barely touches the heat and scandal of the book and changes to many of the towns people's personalities. Norman truly is a war hero? Rodney is noble? For any fan of the book, you will be sorry that they didn't or perhaps couldn't because of the time frame stick to the story.I don't much care for watered down drinks, and the same goes for this story."
3,Surprised,"Generally, I find American films of the 1950s and 1960s as extremes....either superb or a pat formula like processed food. I fully expected ""Peyton Place"" to fall into the latter category especially when considering its genre. Although no ""Cape Fear"" or ""Blackboard Jungle,"" this movie is a better than average drama and I really enjoyed it. If you have a general aversion to soap opera, as I do, give this film a try. It's not the dreary 1960s tv series but rather good popcorn entertainment."
3,If you travel to Crete,"If you travel to Crete, and if you are interested in the detailed history of World War II battles which, in the grand order of things, played only a second tier role, this is the book to read. Otherwise, you might enjoy more some other reading.This book has one clear shortcoming, its maps which are quite inadequate for a useful understanding of the challenges of the battlefield."
3,The Disposable Underpads,it serves its short term purpose of holding fort without a diaper.It makes keeping the chair or bed clean when aerating the bucky
5,Blue Disposable Underpads(Chux) Large,These chuxs are very useful for keeping your bed pad and sheets clean. You can also use it for eating so you don't get food on the bed. They are a good buy.
5,great for multiple uses,"These are great-huge, super cheap and good for many purposes. I use them as a liner for under the cat's litter box (to catch spilled litter and ""misses""). Other uses could be for house-breaking dogs, disposable diaper changing pads, etc."
2,Champion Underpad,"Don't like it. Doesn't work as advertised. It will absorb liquid OK, but doesn't remain in place as manufacturer claims. Not good for anyone who moves in their sleep. I had to secure it with duct tape! Not good."
1,You Get What You Pay For!,"I use underpads beneath the cat litter boxes because I have an elderly cat who occasionally has an accident. I'd been using Walgreen's brand underpads but decided to try these because they're less expensive. First off, the package these pads came in had no labeling whatsoever so there is no way to verify if I really received the brand I paid for. Next, the border surrounding the padded area on these pads is much wider than the Walgreen's brand, which means the padded absorbent area is smaller. Also, the padding is thinner, which means it doesn't absorb as well. These underpads are pitiful - don't waste your money! This is a perfect reminder that you get what you pay for..."
5,Very convenient ..Use and throw!!,"I am useing for my baby changing table. Though have changing mattress and it's cover, i use disposable underpad. It's very good and it has good capacity to absorbe.I use Champion Blue Disposable Underpads for my baby massages time and leave him without diaper without any worries.Champion Blue Disposable Underpads (Chux), Large Size 23 x 36, Pk/25"
3,Disposable Underpads,They help! There's not as many changes of bedding to do. They help with a sad problem. We use two pads over the mattress cover as well.
4,useful!!!!,I am recovering from a bad accident which laid me up for months and i'm very happy with this product
3,these tend to come apart,I buy these pads to use as puppy potty pads for my 2 small dogs but these tend to come apart when I used for my puppies. I prefer the green or blue ones over these. They are small and not real absorbent.
3,Lite protection,I purchased these chux to protect the bedlinen from accidents but I found I needed something more absorbant so I'm glad I also purchased the bedpads. I needed more protection then these provided.
2,not absorbent as advertised,"Supposedly holds 40 oz liquid - unfortunately, not so. Saturates easily and leaks right through the plastic. I've used puppy weewee pads that work better."
2,Absorbs 40oz of what???? Obviously DRY goods,"These pads would not absorb a teaspoon of ANYTHING wet, it would seep right in and fall apart. I used them as extra protection on top of my sheets while working...they are thin and ALL the white padding you see in the pic certainly is NOT in the ones they ship. The inside padding is so thin and sparse you can see the blue plastic through the ""cotton"" center. I guess you do get what you pay for...I can still use them but I will NEVER order these again...I guess they are so cheap and you get free shipping because they know the people who buy them will be so ticked off once they receive them. I guess they are trying to empty the inventory. I will NEVER but these things again."
2,They seem very thin,"I just received this product. I use underpads for my mother, who is bedbound and incontinent. They seem rough and very thin. Probably won't be ordering these in the future."
4,"Good camera, but...","This is a very good compact camera, but there are a few things that make some pictures a problem. When shooting in low light conditions there seem to be a lot of problems with the flash, especially if I take pictures of kids. Flash makes the person/object way too light, no matter what kind of flash I use auto/on/red eye etc. If I try not to use the flash, then there is a lot of blur. When outside in the bright sun most images are way too light. I will be very grateful to anyone who knows how to resolve these problems. It can be a little frustrating. I tried every possible setting, but so far no luck."
5,fell down stone steps,"I had a Canon A40, A 95 and now the SD600.The A40 was good but did not have enough pixelsthe A95 fell off a table and broke.the SD600 bounced down 8 stone steps and nothing happened, it did not even have a dent the pictures are better than on the A 95 and all the great things everybody says are true.I am writting this because falling down stone steps without getting damaged is unbelievable !"
4,Great Little Camera,"Got this right before our wedding and honeymoon. Takes great pictures and is very easy to use. One little problem is that on our honeymoon, the battery died and it would not charge back up, so the camera was dead the last 2 days. When we got home we charged it up again and it was fine at first, then gave us some more problems. Not sure if this will continue to be a problem. Support said return the camera but we have not got around to that yet."
4,No Date Stamp,"Unable to date-stamp. Also, the switch for Picture/Movie/Picture Review is often inadvertantly moved. Otherwise a good camera."
2,"Nice camera, horribly defective LCD screen","Had this camera for about 8 months. Takes nice photos and is very compact, however I will never be able to use this camera again, since as of this week the LCD screen has fractured for the second time. The first time I sent the camera in (this was about 2 months after purchase) I naively believed that the camera was under warranty (as it was supposed to be) and the screen would be fixed. Canon told me that it was my fault the LCD screen broke - even though the camera was kept secure in a padded camera bag and was never dropped. I tried fighting that but Canon was resolute, so I ended up paying around 130 dollars for the repair. In order to prevent this problem from happening again I attached a 1/8th of an inch plexiglass protective screen over the new LCD. That worked fine until last week when out of the blue, the same problem of a crack in the screen appeared again. Not going to repeat the same mistake twice... I've given up with Canon."
1,Research before you buy!!,"ok, nice pictures but I had a lens error right after the 6 month warranty ran out and after a little research i found out it is quite common with canon digital cameras. So search for ""lens error"" or e18 lens error and canon. None of the suggestions fixed it. Nothing I can do but get a new camera and it definitely won't be a canon!!! A lot of people have had problems getting canon to even honor the warranty."
4,Canon 600,"I have owned Canon before and like the cameras. I bought the 600 because of the price and the $40.00 discount for opening a credit card. I looked at the Canon 450 and the 700, but felt this was a better deal on price to features.I had occation to contact Canon about the automatic aperature (seem to be always on 2.8) but, Chris, the tech, gave me a reasonable explanation and noted my concern. It was a good experience talking with Canon Support, which is rare these days.I would buy another Canon"
5,Great digital camera for the family!,"I have had standard film SLR cameras and 2 Sony digital cameras, and I completely satisfied, if not overly satisfied with this camera. It is sturdy, easy to use and best of all, my wife doesn't complain on ""how do I use this camera?""... takes great pictures, easy to change between modes (auto vs. many manual modes) and compact. I do recommend purchasing a large SD card (preferably the 1 GB size)"
3,Nice and compact,So far so good.....a little hard to navigate.....old cheap Kodak seemed to take better pictures....I probably am doing something wrong and dont know it? I do like the size of it along with the case I bought....battery seems to last pretty long....pretty good camera!
5,A sweet little camera,We bought one for my son a year ago and liked it so much that we picked up another for ourselves. Nice pictures can be taken without needing a rocket science degree. Has held up very well.
5,Great Camera!,"Im not an expert reviewer, but this camera is great. The picture quality is pretty nice, and what I like about it is that you can choose your levels of ISO. Im not much of a camera person, but all I know is that it makes me look like me, and that there's no need to photoshop anymore!"
5,Love it,"I love this camera. This is my second digital camera in a few years. The screen is big, the pictures are crisp and fast- which is nice when you're trying to catch kids who are always on the move. It's small and light and the rechargable battery lasts a really long time.I definetely recommend this camera.My old camera was so slow that I most of my picutres were of the back of kids heads as they moved. It was terribly frustrating. I was secretly happy when my kids spilled juice on it so that I could get rid of it and get this new one."
5,Excellent and Affordable,"If you're looking for a semi-cheap, small camera with decent quality... YES. GET THIS.It's user friendly, no matter who you are. The automatic setting as well as all of the other preset adjustments (sports, etc.) is perfect for those not experienced in photography. However, the manual setting allows for ISO adjustment, contrast, and numerous other options.I'd recommend a case, too."
4,Its good for its price,I bought this camera a few months back. The camera is very user friendly and has good resolution even with videos.I would recommend it to any person looking for a camera in this range.
5,Canon PowerShot SD600 6MP Digital Elph Camera,"Works great and takes excellent pictures. Movies are a bit shaky because it is hard to hold such a tiny camera still. Small size makes it easy to take on trips, but screen is as large as on much bigger cameras.Amazon's price was the lowest that I've seen anywhere, and shipping was very quick."
4,Canon SD600 camera,"Love this camera. It's small and easy to use. Takes terrific pictures. My only complaint is that it doesn't give you a lot of warning that the battery is low. Although the battery lasts a long time and the charger is very small and easy to travel with, if you're at an event and the battery dies, you're out of luck until you can charge it."
2,Disappointment in Canon Camera,"The camera is not of the quality it was touted to be by the seller. I knew it wasn't new, but selected it from the available model of similar price and advertised quality. I understand buying sight unseen is a roll of the dice, but this was snakeeyes.The seller must have known about the poor quality of the camera.It has more than just fair wear and tear. It has dents and scratches exceeding the description.Normal expectation is that the camera would come with at least a limited operating chip. It had none.The battery is also defective, retaining a charge for only five pictures. I was able to cannibalize the chip from my old camera and utilize the battery from that, but the battery/chip slot is not secure. It appears ready to break.All in all, it should be replaced by the seller."
4,Breaks easily,"Canon PowerShot SD600 6MP Digital Elph Camera with 3x Optical ZoomThis camera's LCD screen became unusable within 2-3 months of use-it has a break that shows clearly across the screen. My daughter says it has not been dropped and had no major temperature changes. It does take good pictures, but we have to use the viewfinder."
3,"Takes good pictures, good batery life but could be better at low light",I am using it for about a month a now and I like it. It takes excellent pictures in day light and has a good battery life. Unfortunately in my experience the pictures do not come out so good in low light and at night. I have tried the night mode but still do not get the same results.The color swap function also works only if the colors being used for swaping (both original and new) are bright colors otherwise turns the photo something unimaginable!!!I would recommend this camera to a friend but along with these issues. Also other people may have a different experience.
4,A Great little diddy!,"This camera is super easy to use, quick to the shot, and great for both trips and parties.I literally purchased this camera two days prior to a trip to the islands and returned with some great shots...."
5,Great camera!,"I'm not a maven, but I am very happy with my sd600. It takes great pictures, it has a big screen, but the body is still very small.The video isn't great, but ok.I also love the battery - it's quick to charge and lasts a long time.All in all - a great and fun camera!"
5,Fantastic,This camera is such an improvement to the 3.2 elf I used to own. It is so much faster to take multiple pictures and the quality of the image looks great. You don't have to wait while the screen resets itself!
5,"Great quality pictures, and not a bad price!","I received this camera as an early Christmas present and it is the best one I could ever get! This camera is extremely easy to understand, and the pictures are fantastic! If you have a high enough memory card, you can even take high-definition videos. Not a complaint yet!"
5,Attention Magnet,"This gadget is a must-have for gadget lovers.....and picture lovers. It is compact, solid and fits any small pocket or clutch bag. The images are crisp if you get it set appropriately. If you love attention get this product and if you don't .....not to worry the camera gets all of it."
3,Great as Backup,"We got this as a backup to our Sony DSC F717 and for portability when a full size camera case is too bulky. For that it works fine, but I would not buy this as a primary camera.The lens is just too small to gather a lot of light compared to a inch wide or bigger lens. So almost every inside shot must be done with the flash on otherwise the picture is blurry, and the flash over whitens the subject and under lightens the background in auto mode. Its a shame cause the resolution is very good and the video mode is very good.So is best in daylight outside when flash not needed.Now maybe the IS ones would be better in indoor light without flash cause then it might adjust to not blur."
1,Good camera until it malfunctioned,"I bought this handy camera as a gift. It worked for a couple of weeks, then proved to be defective: The zoom lens is stuck open and will not retract. I have to return it. For convenience I am replacing it with the same camera, but would not recommend this model based on my experience."
3,LCD screen malfunction within a month of purchase,I bought the SD600 with a canon leather case in late December of 2006.On a trip to Mexico in Jan the LCD screen quit working. When I sent the camera in for warranty repair they sent me a bill saying the camera had suffered damage from customer and was not covered. I never dropped the camera and always kept it in the case. In fact it work one night and the next day when I removed it from the case the LCD screen would not work.After complaining to the repair center they did agree to repair the camera at no charge. I would be interested to know if any other comsumers have experienced the same problem with what would appear to be a very fragile LCD
3,you get what you pay for,"The camera only cost me 213, so that was good. Its small size is perfect for puting in a shirt pocket and it takes generaly alright pictures. My main complain is with the zoom. 90% of the time, when I zoom in, I get camera shake. I have contacted Canon and they are going to look at it for me and see if there is a warranty issue there. Canon has excelent customer service and is why I buy Canon. Also, if you have an older canon Digital camera,that doesn't work, check their website, they might repair it free of charge."
4,Excellent camera,"Everything is just great, except two things. 1. Hate to take the battery out to be charged. 2. No way of knowing how much battery life you have left on the camera. If there is an indicator, I surely didn't see it in the manual or any of the buttons."
5,great,Very good camera. My Uncle loves it. I gave this to him as a gift. He has no trouble with this product.Loury
4,I love the huge screen!,"This camera takes awesome pictures, but it is a little difficult to use the different features unless you read the manual front to back. My only real complaint is there is no ""action"" function/feature to catch a quick shot of a baby, for example."
5,great camera,"For the money, this is a great deal. I looked into higher end model cameras but for half the money you can get the sd600 and its more than what i need."
5,Great camera,"I have had this camera for a month and I really love it. I did a lot of research and this was a great camera for the price. I am still trying to learn all the features the camera offers but I reference the manual a lot and so far it explains everything I need to know.I recommend this camera, it takes great quality shots."
4,Nearly two years old and still doing a great job,"The wife and I took this along to Germany on vacation in Sep 2006, and for a back-up to our 30D it was great. Quick into action and very non-intrusive, it goes with me just about everywhere. I often keep it in my laptop accessory bag.If used for what it was intended (point and shoot) it is a great camera. Sharp focus, good colors, and nicely adjustable ISO and flash settings. Battery life is excellent. I go for months between charging. Higher flash usage would probably cut this back though.The only thing keeping me from giving it 5 stars was the wimpy flash. You can get one of those $20 slave flashes to fill in or bounce if you like. Vary happy with it and glad we got it. Hope it lasts for a while."
2,Amen to lens problem.,"I've had 2 Canon's and both had the lens retraction problem. No more for me. They will offer to repair if the warranty is out for $99. Or, they will offer you a refurb for, in case, $150. Not good enough...no more Canon's."
5,you will like it from the very beginning.,"tiny and cute, suitable for girls. the battery is long lasting.. the quality of pictures is also great. the only thing is when it comes to sunset, the color is not that beautiful."
5,Awesome camera for the price!!!,"i have researched so much for a camera, but couldnt find a better one till this. pictures are great, great clarity, zoom. only drawback is that battery gets discharged fast. other than that this is very good"
3,"Uh, whatever",The case is a little too plastic-y for my liking. Canon has better quality at slightly higher price points. This is a very thin and light camera however and takes decent pictures. Overall it's a very boring offering from Canon. The price is about right.
1,PLEASE DON'T BUY THIS CAMERA!,"At first this camera was great. I bought it about 4 monhts ago and was a little hesitant after reading some of the reviews regarding len's errors. Well, I should have listened to my gut feeling about this. Dropped this camera once inside my house on carpeting and that was it. It didn't fall hard and it didn't land with the lens out. The drop wasn't very bad, I would certainly think it would be a little more durable. Accidents happen, cameras should not break that easily. I will never ever buy another canon."
2,Lense errors,"Barely had the camera a month and now it's trash. Took it to glamis twice and it died on the second trip. The reason I bought a canon was my s45 has lasted forever--boating, duning, travel (costa rica, kauai, etc). After researching the lense jam error it seems to be a pretty common problem. Just wanted to give folks a heads up. Airborne sand/dust killed it--and I guess the expectation that the camera could hold up in an outdoor environment was just asking too much."
1,Terrible photo quality. My cell phone takes better pictures,"I had a Sony CyberShot that I loved for a few years, but my wife broke it on vacation recently. So I shopped around and saw rave reviews here on Amazon for the Canon PowerShot SD600. I ended up buying it... I am about to return it.The image quality is poor. I fiddled with all the adjustments but any shot with white in the background gets washed out. Also, the colors are sort of washed out, too.However, the worst part about this camera is that the ""shake warning"" icon is displayed when using any amount of zoom. The instructions suggest using a tripod when this occurs -- it occurs every time you want to snap a photo!Don't get this camera."
4,Great Camera,"This little camera is so lightweight and takes very good pictures. For it's size, the LCD screen is big and clear. The video quality with the zoom function is good. I'd definitely recommend this camera for anyone who is looking for something compact, easy to use and don't want to spend alot of money."
1,Makes Horrible Red Eyes!!!,"Almost every photo of people has a problem with ""horrible red eyes"".And of course, the auto red-eye reduction option is turned on, but it has no use. The worst thing is I just sold my lovely Sony CyberShot camera to buy this useless Canon SD600. With my Sony CyberShot I did not have any red eye problems. I am completely dissapointed by this Canon SD600. I wish I could get my old dearly Sony SyberShot back!"
5,A question...,"On Black Friday 2006, I braved the long lines of Circuit City to purchase the camera ""of my dreams.""I haven't actually opened the box yet, but I've done tons of research. One thing that seems to evade my knowledge on every review site however, is the question of the SD card.Can you just remove the SD card whenever you want, or do you have to plug the camera into the computer each time you want to transfer your pictures?I would be extremely thankful if someone could tell me this.Thanks!:)"
2,Incredibly disappointed,"I bought the Japanese version (IXY Digital) of this camera back in May, and I'm extremely disappointed in its picture quality. Even in daylight the pictures are blurry with noise. In fact, just about every photo I've taken has been no good. I took comparison shots with my previous camera -- Canon IXUS 4.0 -- and the IXUS pictures were better by a longshot.I was happy with the performance of my old IXUS, but was looking for a larger display. Unfortunately this new IXY is a big compromise on quality. Looks like my experience is out of the ordinary (except for the first reviewer), but I'd just like to warn people about this. I've always been a big Canon fan, and I'm unsure what to do about this camera since the warranty is in Japan only. Looks like I'll be taking the old camera on my next trip instead."
5,Great camera!!,"This little camera does it all, and does it well! I am very pleased with the quality of photos as well as ease of use. It performs well with close-ups as well as doing a decent job from a distance, and the ""automatic"" function optimizes and makes it fool truly proof. I'm very happy with this camera!"
2,Too old to be very useful,"If you only care about the quality of pictures taken in the day and don't want to zoom in or need more than 2 GB on your memory card, the SD600 will do the job. But I want to zoom in more than once, zoom out from normal, take pics in all lighting conditions, and use a 4 GB memory card. This camera will not let me do any of that. I decided it is time to buy a new camera when I was unable to use a 4 GB SDHC memory card on my last vacation. My mom has the newer SD1000 and it takes the SDHC memory cards, so this clearly is an age-related problem. Low-light conditions not only make pictures look horrible, but sometimes make picture-taking impossible, if you don't manually set it for a night or indoor shot."
3,Convenient camera,This camera was a gift for my wife. She loves it! Carries it around in her purse. It is easy to use. She likes the movie and photo review functions. Transferring data to the computer is a snap. I would like to see more zoom.
3,Kind of let down,"I really thought this would be a perfect camera for us but it really isn't. The photos are often grainy or blurry. I have taken many photos of my kids with the kids and pet feature and all of them turn out bad. The flash doesn't really adjust well and often things are too bright. And if you turn off the flash they are grainy. So I do like the size and ease of use, the photo quality has been a let down."
4,Canon SD 600 Digital Camera,"I love this camera. The pictures are clear, crisp and focused. I honestly have not taken a bad picture yet. I only have the camera a few weeks, but I am very happy. It has great features as well. I am still learning some of them, but the main ones I know. Even the orange light that comes on when taking the picture does not bother my child and he does not close his eyes anymore. We have great pictures. I would recommend this camera."
5,This is just wha I was looking for,"This is my 4th digital camera. My last 3 were alright, but not what I needed. I have a blond hair blue eye'ed child and with every camera that I have ever had digital or otherwise, my child looks like the devil with the brightest red eye even the best photo repair program cannot fix. With this camera, NO RED EYE!!! It takes exellent low light photo's too. That was the other feature that I really wanted because I take alot of photo's indoors. They are beautiful. My husband took a photo in the pitch dark and it came out perfect."
2,Megapixel isn't everything,"I was impressed with the canon's sd600's size and simple features. However, the camera struggled to take quality pictures and color saturation was low. I took pictures side by side with my old Canon A70 and a Sony Powershot..and even the 3.2 megapixel images looked better. The quality of the lens or something in my camera was off and I returned it. It may have been my individual one, but I'm looking elsewhere. Not impressed."
5,Good camera!!,"This camera is a perfect camera in terms of picture quality, ease of use, fast shutter speed settings, compact so that it can easily be carried in my pocket. I got this camera five days ago. Used it to take several pics already and I must say I love it. The lcd screen is big enough to get a clear view of what will be covered. I can set the brightness of the lcd so that it doesn't look grainy. Obviously the pic taken is different (in terms of clarity) that what I see in the lcd. I also bought the cannon leather case with this that looks sleek. Also bought 1gb memory card with which I can take several hundred pics depending on the resolution setting. Get this camera it is pretty good."
5,Great Camera,"I owned an older version of this camera (cannon digital elph 3.0 megapixels) that I loved so I upgraded to this one. I love it! I don't have any complaints, my pictures print out beautifully! I highly recommend this camera!"
4,SD600 ELPH-Cannon,Great little camera takes beautiful color pictures. Has an awesome onboard prosesser with very nice optics. Very satisfied with this purchase.
5,Excellent camera,Pros1) Excellent Battery Life2) Records videos of decent quality3) excellent picture quality4) Very lightweight & value for moneyCons:1) Some of the pictures come out blurred.
4,Camera was good.,"The camera works fine. Perhaps some sand got in or on the camera at one point... No charger for battery, but otherwise, good sale. Very prompt."
4,Good buy!,"For someone who has never owned a digital camera, I found this camera very intuitive and user-friendly. It didnt take too long to figure out the features and especially the menu settings. I would definitely recommend this camera for a beginner. However, this may not be the sleakest model in the market but definitely worth the money."
5,great camera,best camera for price. easy to use and compact. i gave two of these for christmas. takes excellent pictures
4,Great Camera - fits in any purse,I absolutely love this camera. Takes great pictures and goes anywhere. Battery life is very long also.
5,Excellent mini camera!,"excellent picture quality, easy to use, very easy to carry around due to the small size.Only one complaint: Even when I turn on adjustment for red eye, some pictures still come out with red eye."
4,SD 600,This is my first digital camera- I love it - it does more than I could imagine... The manuals included with this product are some of the worst I've ever seen!!!! I can't believe they could not do better...
3,Nice but not good enough!,"The SD600 is a nice small camera if pocket size is your main concern.The resolution is good, color reproduction is OK, but leans to the yellow side. The thing that really made me return the cameera was the FLASH!Allmsot every people photo had red eye, even on the adults. If your taking snap shots of scenery or people photos without flash this camera will do a fine job."
1,so disappointed,"bought camera, took 20 pictures and then lens refused to retract. this is a very common problem (see the review with website that tracks this error). canon won't fix b/c i bought the camera in the middle east. must take it there for repair:( otherwise fix is about $150. With shipping etc it's just not worth it. next camera won't be a Canon."
2,"Handy and easy to use, but not a good camera","I bought this camera in the first week of Jan, 2007 from Amazon for $215. Till then I was using 4 Mega Pixel Sony Camera , purchased in July, 2002.This camera as the name (elf) implies is very compact and hence fits easily in my pocket. The usage of the camera and selection of various modes and other adjustments are very straight forward.But picture quality is poor.I took several pictures with this camera for last 3 months using various modes. But overall the pictures taken with the Sony camera appears much better ( no exaggeration!!) than this new generation camera.Now I am planning to buy another camera as a gift, but I wouldn't buy this model or related models"
4,"generally good, but...","As photocamera, it is rather average.As videocamera, it is worth moneyMain Pros:1) Very good video quality. In fact, it may well replace your old videocamera.2) Easy pushed buttons3) Big screenMain Contra:Photo image is a bit fuzzy for me. I tried different modes, and it is still fuzzy. Before, I had Kyocera 5mp camera and in similar conditions the image was much more distinct.That Kyocera camera was a bit heavier but of similar size, so the small size of the Cannon itself seems to be not a primary reason for the fuzzy image."
3,"Not bad, but expected better.","I bought this camera approximately two weeks ago and have not had any mechanical problems with it. I used to do professional photography but now just putter around with cameras. I had the Powershot A80 and sold it to purchase this camera.I am not greatly impressed with this camera and matter of fact with the exception of the various things that you could do with this camera, I don't fine the pictures much better than the Canon Powershot A410 which I also own. In fact the pictures taken in low light with the A410 are better than this camera, that also goes for the video. There is a lot of grain when used at speed 400 and 800.The good about this camera is it is small and easy to carry with you at all times. The viewfinder is fairly large and easy to see pictures in low light that the camera cannot take very well.All in all the camera is okay but I wish I still had my A80."
4,"Good product, but a little disappointed","The overall of this product is nice. There are a few minor disappointments. My major difficulty right now is the use of the ""automatic"" mode. For some reason I'm getting a handfull of blurry pictures. Those can be fixed, but it still is a little disappointing, too. The other thing is that the view screen is very nice; however, sometimes the picture looks blurry on the screen, but when you zoom-in, you realize that it's actually quite crisp.Also, I've noticed with the video option that the sound is a little delayed during play-back. That could also be an issue with my computer.I love the looks, the size and the price."
4,A good buy,"My wife and I are novices with a camera. Generally, we've gone the disposable route and left the fancy and complicated stuff to the kids. But my wife decided she wanted to step up, and the Canon PowerShot 600 is magnificent. Simple to get going, easy to use and there seems to be enough bells and whistles to keep us learning. Video component easy too. The memory card that comes with the camera holds about six photos so get a more powerful one immediately. The camera is compact, thin and light. I'd give it 5 stars, but figure nothing is perfect."
2,doesn't seem worth the price,"instructions were horrible for such a simple product.if you are used to opening your screen door easily, you will be disappointed.it definitely adds a lot of resistance when opening. despite getting the tension as loose as possible, my wife and kids all noticed the door was way harder to slide open.the pro is that you can adjust how slowly the door closes which is nice."
2,great voice not so great songs,"This guy has a great voice, unfortunatly his compositions do not make good use of it, and they lack a deep beat. it's good coffee house background music, but I bought the album for the song 'bad things' and unfortunately, if I HAD an IPOD, that would be the only song that made it to that media. I love his baritone voice, I'd love to hear more of it, but the rest of the album is kinda mundane."
3,Bad Things,"This was my first Jace Everett cd. I bought it because it features one of my favorite tv show theme songs, Bad Things. I have to say, other than listening to him every week on the show True Blood, I had never heard of him. He sounds a lot different when he does other songs. I'm not quite sure if I like him. I listen to the cd but kind of tune him out on everything but Bad Things. If you're looking for the same thing I was, you're better off with the cd True Blood. On that one, you'll not only hear Bad Things, but a lot of others from the show. But hey, that's just an opinion. If you already know and like Jace Everett, you might very well love this one."
4,very good,Love his voice!!! Purchased this because of the True Blood theme song - very satisfied. If you like the theme song give this cd a shot I think you will love it.
2,old cd for outragious price,"I'm a BIG fan of True Blood and the theme song ""Bad Things"" is awesome, but chargeing that much for a cd that's over 2 years old is laughable"
1,No Receive,"Until now I didn`t receive the product. I searched for informations on the mail company but there wasn't a number order for me. I need from you something to track my order since EUA until Brazil. Thank you, Gustavvo Bittar"
3,The Academy,Mark Collantes 'The Academy' paints an interesting picture of the effects military structure and discipline can have on the minds of young men and women. The story portrays one Asian American's struggle to utilize the sometime painful lessons that he's learned during the long summers at The Academy.The morally ambiguous ending allows readers to decide whether the protagonist actually managed to rise above the military perspective or if he reacts to crisis in the only way he's been taught.
4,An enjoyable continuation...,"Nessa continues to grow and mature into a young woman who puts her faith in God during difficult circumstances. This book will help young readers understand that everyone has challenges in life and provides insight into how one young woman faced her diffculties with God's help. The book is inspiring, a relaxing and easily read book for young adults. I recommend it heartily and look forward to the next volume of the series."
1,Buy Something Else (A Drummer's Perspective),"I bought this on the satisfaction of the first volume alone. I made a big mistake. If you want to see great drumming, I highly recommend you buy the first volume.If you want an unknown cover band with world class drummers who aren't given solos (just extended fills), then this is the DVD for you. There is very little actual drumming highlighted in this video. The best drumming is actually not shown so they could feature a voodoo scene. The Clark Brothers TAP routine was quite refreshing but failed to resurrect this purchase.I've rated it ONE star because ZERO was not an option."
4,great textbook,"This is the texbook I had in college. It was and still is great, but for one...being a textbook ...it is more theoretical and two, it lacks certain areas. Nevertheless, it is very usefull. I would complement it with a book that I have recently read: Heads In Beds - hospitality and tourism Marketig by Ivo Raza. This is very practical and covers the areas that are missing from Kotler's textbook like Loyalty marketing, COOP with Touroperators, targeting travel agents, creating promotional materials, development, etc. Combined, both books truly give a complete overview of the complex travel indutry and should be the foundation for people studying or working in travel and tourism."
1,WARNING!!!!!,WARNING!!! Stay away from MARKMONTANABOOKS at all cost! The seller is not TRUSTWORTHY and will RIP YOU OFF!!! I purchased a textbook from the seller in the beginning of February and needed it ASAP so I paid for express shipping which means I should of got my product at most 3days later.... 22 days later I finally received the product to just find out that he gave me the book that was not as advertised. If I wanted to give away my money I would of just gave it to a worthwhile cause like Red Cross! Hey con artist I want my money BACK!!!!
5,Great for Marketing Beginners,"Kotler's Marketing for Hospitality and Tourism helps marketing beginners and people that are getting into the hospitality business. It demonstrates basic knowledge that can be applied to the business, great tool for working!"
4,Area 51 real or fake,"The video of ""Secrets of UFOs: Area 51 Base"" was well done with alot of information to support the video. There was alot of people who I have seen in previous videos likeUFOs & Area 51: Secrets Of The Black Worldwho said the excact same thing and must have taken the video clip from this one and used it in this video. This video is in the same series asSecrets of UFOs: Roswell UFO Crashand some of the information was the same. It was produced and made by the same company. Overall, I was happy with the video and thought it was a good review and summary of what I already have seen previously. It is a must for any UFO seeker."
5,Very well done,"This is short, about 50 min or so, but its to the point. With all the research I have been doing, its also on the mark. This comes off as serious and informative as well. At such a low cost, it well worth it to buy. I highly recommend this DVD."
4,Unexpected and fun.,"I bought this book at first because I too have a strange passion for Volkswagens. I was thoroughly delighted when I discovered that Mr. Nicholson had a great story to back up the VW obsession, once I got over the horror of destroying all those VWs that is. The strange cast of characters and their individual motivations are brilliantly woven together. The amazing thing is that even at it's most confusing and destructive I didn't want this novel to end. I look forward to trying his other works."
4,Cool Obsession,"I was worried that this book might be to 'British' for my American tastes, but it was wonderful. Well paced, colorful characters, and a good mix of action and humor. Well worth the money."
3,A tale of fiction,"I didn't know this was a work of fiction, and not non-fiction. It is told from England, and deals with New Agers, Hippies, and Neo-Nazies. I was entertained by the story, but if given more details about the nature of this book, I would not re-purchase."
2,"Love baby elmo, but he gets filthy","this is such a great doll, but he looks filthy after a while and nothing gets him clean. After a while i gave him away because it seemed unsanitary"
2,Not much meat,This book fell far short of my expectations. Not much meat for $40. Seemed more like a pamphlet than a book. I was expecting more design information that would make it possible for me to build my own expandable house.
4,In and outs!,"A beautiful woman is accused of murdering her husband; and a young criminal lawyer will try by all his means, to demonstrate her innocence, although on the road he will fall in love with her.An uneven film considering the stature of his director."
3,An Interesting Misfire,"Almost no one associated with ""The Paradine Case"" was pleased by the result: not Selznick, who produced it as the last of a what turned out to be a three-picture deal with Hitchcock for his studio (the others being ""Rebecca"" and ""Spellbound""); not the director, whose motives for accepting the project seemed fuzzy even to him in hindsight; not Gregory Peck, who claimed to have liked it least of all his films. ""Paradine"" is no Hitchcock classic; yet neither is it a dud. Though dated, it is a handsomely mounted, interesting study of obsession that ""Vertigo"" would deliver in spades a decade later. This film also features Charles Laughton, stealing the show in a supporting role, and Louis Jordan in his film debut. (Note: Because this film is currently so hard to find on DVD, I took a chance on a Chinese import and was not disappointed.)"
4,"Powerful, painful","This book is one of the most emotionally powerful books I've read in a long time. It made me want to cry at times.The story is basically about a woman who loses her husband and son in a horrific fictional terrorist attack in London (ironically, the book was released either a day before or a day after the London Subway attacks).The book chronicles her pain and suffering as everything she knows falls apart and she piteously tries to hold on to something, anything.This book will seriously tear at your heart as you read it."
4,Fabulous narrator on audio,"I listened to this novel on CD, narrated by Susan Lyons. What a fabulous job! This story was about the pain and the passion of the main character, who had lost her son and husband in a terrorist bombing--Ms. Lyons translated all of this pathos elegantly, missing none of the anger, the incredulity, the bitterness, the near-lunacy of the grieving woman. I think I would've have missed some of the nuance of this novel if I'd read it myself instead of listened to this fine narration."
5,Incendiary,This book was excellent and a real page turner. The method of telling the story as letters to Bin Laden was brilliant as was the plot.
3,Don't read AFTER you've read The Other Hand,"While Incendiary is a perfectly okay book, I read it after I read Cleave's other novel ""The Other Hand"". I was expecting a lot from this book and was counting down the days til I received it. However, it proved to be a huge disappointment after the award-winning 'Hand'.If you're interested in reading this book, read it first and then go on with The Other Hand - you won't be disappointed :)"
1,Could barely Finish,"I just had no sympathy for the main character. It started out so great, and then just went down hill from there.The woman had huge issues, and I could not find anything to identify with.I forced myself to finish it, and did not care for the ending either.My review is I did not like it b/c while a horrible thing happened to the main character, I never really felt anything for her."
2,An unpleasant experience,"I purchased this book because of Little Bee. I wanted to read another book by the same author. I did not like the experience. To make up a horror to rival the twin towers was not what I wanted to read. There was no redemption in the characters. Interestingly, I shared this book with a couple of my more eclectic reader friends. They had the same negative reaction."
1,rubbish,I made it to the middle of the book and finally gave up. The author just lost me on all the unnecessary sexual descriptions he insisted on writting. The character is unlikable and most of the other characters were just flat out sick puppies. I have noticed that this book has a Book Club Readers edtion. Notice to Readers Clubs all over: don't waste your time.
1,utter drivel,"I have no problem with complicated protagonists, but this female, who has lost her husband and son in a terrorist attack on a soccer game the moment she is in the throes of passion with another man, is the least believable female character I have ever read. Her character's rambling speeches give street-smart insight into human behavior, life in London, etc. Yet in the next paragraph she makes decisions no woman would make, even if she is suffering absolute grief and PTSD> It just doesn't make sense. The nail in the coffin in this book is that none of the characters are believable. Unless they are all pathologically narcissistic (maybe that's the point??), and incredibly inconsistent about it, all of their interactions are utterly unbelievable."
2,Almost didn't finish this one....,"""Incendiary"" is a tale told as a letter from a London working class woman to Osama bin Laden. She has a husband who is in the local bomb squad (detection and dismantling) and a son, ""four years and three months old."" She tells the story of a bombing in London and its impact -- on London and on herself.Though the narrator is not supposed to be that educated, the poor grammar and continual run-on-sentences make the narrative hard to follow. (Yes, I've heard of stream-of-conciousness, but really!) She is not someone we could learn to like, or even feel for that much, because of her bad choices. We almost find ourselves wanting bad things to happen to her. Though I'm sure this was not Cleave's purpose, this narrator actually comes off giving readers a poor opinion of working-class people. Also, the story was just plain harsh! Granted there was no gentle way to tell a story like this, but Cleave goes too far. I cannot recommend this book."
1,Disgusting,"I was assigned this for a college English 101 class: be warned, it is full of sex scenes, terrible grammar, and a COMPLETE lack of morals. I am going to complain to my college; are we supposed to be LEARNING from this???!!! If you have doubts, read it yourself. The average good person will be disgusted by 'Incendiary.' This is the SLIME off the streets of London, the CAUSE of the stench from its back teeth - and the rest of the world, as well.Some try to say that this book is a story about survival: it's not; the main character is completely destroyed, and ends up almost murdering people and going LITERALLY crazy. One of the three main characters is killed by police for pretending to have a bomb. The main character sleeps around with anybody (self-proclaimed) as a way to deal with her stress.GO FIGURE!!!"
3,Just okay...,"This book is just okay. Little Bee is much better, and what prompted me to read this literary work by the author. If you want to be impressed by this author, read ""Little Bee"". Incendiary is not captivating, and I only enjoyed reading about half the pages of this book. I definitely would not suggest this book as a must read for anyone, especially if you have a busy schedule and squeezing in a good read is a sacrifice of your time. Pick something else to enjoy, this book is a leisure, ""nothing better to do"" read."
3,"Good, but not Great","Like many other readers of contemporary fiction, I was very enthusiastic about Chris Cleave's recent novel ""Little Bee."" Cleave has a distinct authorial voice and paints vivid characters. I had somehow missed his first novel, ""Incendiary,"" but read it recently and am glad I did. As in ""Little Bee,"" Cleave here creates a memorable character, a working-class woman from London whose husband and son die in a terrorist attack on a London soccer stadium. The book takes the form of an extended letter from this woman to Osama bin Laden, whom she holds responsible for her shattered life and unrelenting grief.The voice of this Everywoman is distinctive, and Cleave's style engaging. But I found the narrative so unbelievable in places that the book's ultimate quality was dragged down. It's still a good read, but serious fiction should at least be credible"
1,A book with tooooooooooo many mistakes,"Great texbook. However, has too many mistakes. Answers are not reliable"
2,Weak Binding!,"While the intellectual content of this book seems to be up to par, the book itself is very poorly made. Within a few occurrences of rather light use, the binding has already started to come apart!"
3,An advanced text,Make sure that you keep your deformable solids book because this book does not contain any of the basics for reference.
1,BOOOOOOOOOOOO,"This mP3 player is absolutely terrible, the sound quality sucks. and it has about enough memory for fifty songs. it doesnt even deserve one star!!"
1,Buyer Beware this item does not really rate even a 1.,"I could not get this ""player"" to turn off! Nor could I set up playlists. The pictures I loaded were distorted and the presets for the FM function, guess what,they didn't work either. I returned it. Sadly it cost me return postage, but Amazon did refund my credit card in a timely manner. I would not consider a product from Coby again. I instead purchased a Sansa as the Christmas gift for my husband and it works very well.This product does not deserve a star....trash can yes...star no! Too bad there is no ZERO."
5,Wow This Girl!,Excellent all tracks are amazing bringing fresh taste and pleasant hearing. Production of all tracks are well what can i say first class well done to Adrian Posse J L Pagan and Estefano and of course well done to Litzy never heard of this girl till i saw her on BMG US LATIN website and boy her vocals are great in both Spanish and English.. Great Album! Great Tracks! Great Singer!
2,Better than nothing,"These dvds focus mostly on the history of biology and a very small bit of theory like a few parts of the plant and kingdoms of biology. These dvds look profesional and are well narriated. If you want dvds that focus on theory and Technique(like what chemicals they use to get DNA out of cells) go to these web sites to find dvds on specific areas that have way more info than theses dvd's. Go to a search engine and search for ""the teaching company""(theoretical) and ""films""(some dvd's have Theory and others have tecnique)."
3,True love strikes again,"Andrea Bocelli is rightly admired for his courage and tenacity as well as for his golden voice. On stage he projects a certain shyness and serenity which do not emerge in ""The Music of Silence"" even though he uses a third person narrative. As to women, he likes them young, witness his estranged wife here called Elena who is 13 years his junior and his present lover here named Vanessa who is twenty plus years younger. As an autobiography this book seems superficial. As for me, I'm waiting for Amazon.com to carry a biography."
5,wonderful for the young gardener,"This book is beautifully written and illustrated in a clear, simple format which is perfect for the elementary school child."
4,Shahrukh and Rani are like Pizza,"Like pizza, even when these two are bad, they are still really really good. The first half of this film is just like any Bollywood movie...these two young carefree but upright people meet and somehow develop a very strong inner attachment to one another...aka falling in love. Then the film takes a more interesting turn by dealing with very practical matters like...the economic status that the two don't share. Shahrukh is from a poorer background while Rani is from a wealthy home...and his ego breaks easily. All the promises of premarital bliss turn into the harsh realities of ""pick up your shoes"" and ""what happened to promises of making me breakfast every morning""...how the rest unfolds is a bit slow and you do lose a lot of interest by the end of the film...but it is still yet another fun adventure with a Bollywood couple for a few hours."
1,Don't waste your time,"I am a huge fan of indian movies, which can be long and sappy. Even as a fan of long and sappy, I found this movie boring. Shahrukh and Rani don't do a very good job of making you believe they are in love and the story is too predictable."
5,Another great one!,I Love Indian Movies. This is another great one. All of Shahrukh's are great!! I love the plot.
5,Why Christmas Trees Aren't Perfect,"A Very heart felt, feel good Christmas story. With good moral teaching for all year. I loved it and had to add it to my favorite selections."
1,Don't waste your money!,These science review disks are completely superficial. The photos and graphics poorly illustrate the ideas and there is not enough information to help students at any level improve their grades. You would be better off wathing PBS regularly. I teach high school biology and earth science and these disks are a rip off! Any decent teacher could put together better power point presentations!
1,"DataPilot for Sony Ericsson-Does it work, or just a fiction","Bought this product about a month back for my Sony/Ericsson T616. But I did not realize, that I am paying for half functional product. Only think is working with the base version: 3.1 is the address book, and rest of feature does not work at all. Contact Susteen (Software manufacturer), and was told to upgrade to the latest version. Then I had a error installing latest version - contacted Susteen again, and was told how to by pass the error. Installed the latest version, and some of the feature start working half. Such as downloading picture from your camera. I cann see the files from the software, but cannot save them in my computer. Contacted the vendor again, and got reply after two weeks, that it will be fix in the Version: 3.3. Now I wonder, what kind quality control Susteen is maintaining before releasing a product in the market."
4,great album,"i first saw king gordy when i went to the d12 world concert in chicago. he was there with his crew da fat killahz and they rocked the house wild, it was crazy fun. then last christmas my freind picked up his album and burned it 4 me and i really like it. its a really good album gordy is a great lyricist and has really good flowz. he combines alot of his music wit kurt cobain style stuff, which 4 him turns out good. the whole album is average to good with the best trax being: 3, 6, 9 (featuring the fat killahz) and 10,make sure u pick up his groups album: ""guess whos coming to dinner?"""
2,dont believe the hype...,i read all these reviews on here and i thought it was gone be a good cd so i downloaded it and it was nuthin but garbage. the only somewhat good songs is when darkness falls and situations. the rest are all weaker than dead people tryin to lift weights...
1,Don't waste your money!,"I have to admit that I haven't read any of the Artist's Way books. Maybe I am missing something here but the back of the tape promised that...""The authors show you how to link creativity to learnable skills; recognize the power that connects creativity with the universe;...recover confindence and courage in order to overcome hurdles"". This is indeed a tall order, and I didn't really expect it all, but this tape delivers nothing! It is a poorly done recording of a seminar given by Julia Cameron and Mark Bryan. There is no real information given on what their idea's are or how to use their methods. There is just a lot inane banter and list making. An example, which was done several times over the course of the tape, is that they ask for you to write what an artist is over and over (we are talking ten times in a row!). This is all there is to the tape. I didn't find it helpful or even interesting."
1,No Real Content - Very Boring Don't waste 2 hours your life,I have to agree with the other reviewers. This was an awful audio book. I listened to one tape and it was very boring and I got nothing out of it. Julia spends the whole first tape jabbering about nonsense and what they plan to do about starting some Company or something. people paid to listen to real self help creative info - not what they are going to be doing. Then there's all the back and forth junk. there is no REAL CONTENT!All I can say glad I did not pay to attend the life workshop.
5,pet's prevention,great seeing prices like this. will order again. vets charge arm & leg for the same product.
2,Dead system,"So it looks like Majesco decided to finally rerelease the GameGear hardware. Unfortunately, I don't think too many people are going to care. First of all there are no new games coming out for the system. The back-lit screen is nice, but it eats batteries (6 AA's last around 3 or 4 hours). And the physical size of the unit is absolutely huge. About the only good thing the system has going for it is the low price. But even with the low price I still don't believe it is worth the price of admission. The money would be better suited going towards a GameBoy Color (or a GameBoy Advance later on this year). The GameGear wasn't worth the money when it launched 9 years ago, and it still isn't today."
2,Why would you want to buy one of these today?,"I bought one when they came out, and they were better than the gameboy and gameboy color, but not gameboy advance.The GBA has a sharper screen, much better graphics and sound.It is smaller and more comfortable, takes less batteries and lasts longer on those batteries. Also I don't know of any game gear games that are 3 and 4 player capable, so you couldn't (and certianly never will in the future), play awesome multiplayer games like Mario Kart, Mario Advance, Advance Wars, Doom, and the new Zelda game with 4 player support (I forgot the name of it.)It really makes no sense why anyone would want one of these nowadays, unless your really poor and ghetto..."
1,Game Gear is so boring,"Game Gear is old and it`s so cheap because it is really old. Game Boy is better. Do not get GG it is old and you can`t find them in Toys R Us. I evan look. Back then when GG was new it was probably expensive like GB and their games were Rip Offs too! Don`t get GG get Game Boy advance. It`s graphics are 32 bit and GG is 8 bit. Game Gear stuff is not available in stores `cause it`s soooooo old! It takes and drains 6 batteries so fast is probably why the screen is fat as the Sega Genesis system and the screen lights and it probably needs tons of batteries. GG gives splits on your hands because it`s rough plastic. So GG is not really all that cool as it seem, so get a Game Boy Advance. I can`t beleive it`s games are clones of the Sega Genesis, so that makes it even more uncooler. GG is not my kind of video game system, I would prefere GBA."
5,isntit,"AAAAhh the legendary gamegear,this really does wave a outsize stick in the general direction of gameboy advance and many other portable gaming systems.Fair enough battery wise it's a bit black hole-ish,but bejesus for a machine thats older than a lot of 9-year old things it is outstanding.laugh in the face of the GB advance and get yer grubby hands on one of these classic technological jobs."
3,what screen,"I'm not sure where the distributor got their products or if they are new or reburbished, but I was very disappointed with the product when it arrived because the screen was scuffed up.It doesn't seem to matter too much though when playing because the screen is so bright. When these first came out I wanted one so bad but couldn't afford it. Now I have one and am a little dissappointed with the clarity of the screen. I'm too used to my XGA tft notebook now. The auto-contrast of tilting the unit is neat but a little too sensitive; it goes from bright to dark to quickly and is hard to find a good angle to view at. But all in all it is probably worth the money or maybe even less for used."
4,"I've tried alot, but this one is the best.","The GameGear is by far the best system. It is truly amazing. It has more colors, more speed and more capability than all gameboy systems, including the Gameboy Advance, yet it was released 10 years before! Some more reasons are:1. The backlit screen makes it look like cathode ray (tv screen). Beats gameboy out for that one.2. The hundreds of colours beat all gameboy systems.3. The speed beats all but the GBA, meaning no loading screens.4. The sound quality is amazing, using true wave and midi.But there would have to be one problem. This thing eats batteries like a pirhana. It takes 6 batteries (GBC only takes 2) and uses them in about 1.5 hours, depending on what game you play. I reccomend buying an adapter: the ones not made for the SGG are cheaper."
3,For nostalgia and more,"Gameboy Advance this is not. But basically it's a pretty good system. Some good games are available for it and at...[the] price, you really can't go wrong, while don't expect any new games for it, the back catalog is good but you probably had to go to ebay or Amazon Auctions to find some of them. It's bulky and battery-hungry but backlit. Mainly for those new gamers or nostalgic old ones to have a piece of gaming history at a price that's cheaper than a new game."
1,THIS SYSTEM SUCKS,"I HATE THIS HUMUNGUOS HANDHELD SYSTEM. GAMEBOY AND GAMEBOY ADVANCE IS WAY BETTER,IWOULD KNOW BECUASE I HAVE ONE.THIS ONE COST TOO MUCH.IT DRAINS THE 6 YOU HAVE TOO PUT IN WAY TOO FAST.GBA LASTS 15 HOURS OF GAMEPLAY.GAME GEAR HAS (...) GAMES.AND THEIR SO OLD YOU CANT FIND THEM ANYMORE.GBA HAS BETTER GRAPHICS MORE COLOR,BETTER SOUND EASIER HANDELING,AND ONLY TAKES TWO BATTERIES.SO DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS GHETTO GEAR,CUASE YUOLL PROBABLY END UP SELLING IT ANYWAY."
2,mediocre all around,"Of the many portable game systems that have been made, the Game Gear failed to amount to much. For starters, it's large, fairly heavy and requires six AA batteries (which it will eat in about 5 hours.) Almost all of its games are conversions from the Sega Master System, and they feel tired and lazy. There are some great games for the system such as Shining Force and Sonic, but most of them are very forgettable.I find the Gamegear to be near the very bottom of the portable systems totem pole (really only the Game.com is worse.) There are more worthy systems available."
1,Game Boy Advance SP is much better,"I think the Game Boy Advance SP is much better.I can't belive the SGG weighs 7 pounds.Plus the GBASP has much much better graphics.Right now I am 10 but in about 25 days I will turn 11.Now I'll list the differinces.SGG has about 4,000 colors total,and GBASP has 32,000 colors total.Did I ever mention that GBASP only weighs 5 ounces.So that is why the GBASP is much better.PS.And the GBASP has much more games to choose from."
4,The Sega Game Gear is THE BEST THING I HAVE EVER PLAYED !,"The Sega Game Gear is the most funnest thing I have EVER played because I had The (GBA)Game Boy Advance but I lost it, but it didn't have a light for me to see at night when the powers out, so then I had to buy those bulky light and magifier and it just strained my eye so bad that I got headaches.This is actullay my first time that I got and the reason why I want this is because the first time I saw it was in 96,' a friend of mine had showed it to me and I loved it and when I couldn't sleep I would just turn it on and go, and the great thing about it is that it has a build it light so you just turn it on and have a blast, plus it works even better when you have the ac and car adapter:)"
3,Majesco's poor decision,"I agree with everything the reviewer ""a gamer"" said about the newer Game Gear. My older son had his Sega made unit for several years. I wanted to purchase my middle son the same unit for Christmas so they could share games, accessories and link together. Along with the core system, I purchased a Powerback rechargeable battery unit for extended game play only to discover that the accessory hole had been deleted from the newer models. I went through [Amazon.com] with this problem and only after sending out a replacement unit did I find out that Majesco had taken over the rights to this system. They made the decision to fill in the accessory hole. A poor decision on their part if you ask me!"
5,Stupid GG haters! Shut up!,"You guys are cramping us GG fans! Sure, GBA is great, but so is Game Gear! Listen, stupid GG haters who say "" Don't buy GG"" and ""GG is a loser""! If I want GG games like GARFIELD IN CAUGHT IN THE ACT, EARTHWORM JIM, and BUGS BUNNY IN DOUBLE TROUBLE, then I'll get a Game Gear!"
2,Old Fashioned,"Game Gear is a thing of the past. This console is OLD FASHIONED. It was released in 1991 and you can tell. It is big, only has two buttons. Game Boy Advance tops it by far. It is light, and the games are easy to get hold of at low prices BRAND NEW!!In my opinion, stick with the new things, at least littluns can use them!!"
4,TV Tuner Not Supported,"Just bought the Game Gear Coreat Toys R Us as a back-up to our original system. However, when I tried to use my Game Gear TV tuner with the core system it will not work. Read the fine print on the box, and it states that this version does not support the TV tuner. The blurb on the WEB site implies it does. For me, lack of the tuner support undermines the value of the system Are there multiple Core versions, one of which does support the TV Tuner?Don"
4,You fools don't know what you're talking about,"This is the Game Gear we're talking about, people! Even though the weight is a disturbing 7 pounds, this is SEGA's first (and only) handheld console! If you think that the SP is so much better, you're wrong. First of all, the GG has a 32-bit color engine, which matches the elite GBA. It also has a backlit screen like the SP, although it lacks shoulder buttons, but remember- this came out in 1990 or earlier, and when the Game boy came out, (much later) it was black and white. GBC wasn't much better, only having 8-bit color, which is only 256 colors! Sure, the thing is big, and the weight is 7 pounds, but its a great handheld for beginners, and gives that nostolgia feeling. So, if the SP is WAY too expensive for you, get this in the meantime....Oh, and the PSP will rule all, but it isnt even out yet, and we have way better technology now than before."
3,"AWSOME, except for a few things...","The Game Gear is awsome! I love it, I've had mine for years. There are only a few problems that I had with it:1.Short Battery Life: It uses 6 batteries at once and those don't even last that long. It's better to just get an ac adapter.2.AC adapter cord: The cord gets worn out only after a little while. You have to hold it in a certain position so that it will work...I even bought a new one, but it still did it after a while.3.The D Pad won't work after a while!: This is the one that really pisses me off, cause its imposible for me to use it any more cause I can't control it. Its like stuck or something and will only let you go left...so I can't use it anymore. :-("
5,It's a little genesis,"This is one of the best systemes in the world!!!!! It has a great collection of games(sonic2, streets of rage and many more) I have gameboycolor and it [stinks] compared to gamegear. The gamegear has alot of titles of the sega genesis. If you are familiar with the genesis at all you know that the system had tones of great games anywaythe gamegear has good color good sound and its old but its the best."
2,Not as good as the original,"This version of the GameGear is good, but not as good as the original, Here is a list:1) The LCD screen is not quite as sharp as the original GameGear2) It does not support the TV Tuner adapter. (You get audio but no picture)3) The case is not as studery & the brightness control is hard to turn.So if you have never used a GameGear before & want an inexpensive portable game system, than go ahead. If you want to replace a warn out, broken, lost one, than this would be an inexpensive alternative. But if you have the TV Tuner, and LOVE the classic game gear than you sould either look for a used classic one or get your's repaired."
1,A doubtfull affair from the fifties (Mono),"Potential buyers of this CD should be aware that it is an historic recording in the sense that both works here are MONO recording from the Fifties.A. Cluytens conducting/reading - specially so with the Rachmaninoff concerto No.3 does not catch fire and Gilels can't exert enough muster to make Cluytens pull his feet out of the mud.For a much-much better collaboration between conductor and pianist, historic recording as well, just to make sure we are on the same page, one should turn to the Horowitz/Reiner 'affair de coeur'...As for the Saint-Saens P/C - - - well... ...This EMI Mono would not be to the liking of many."
3,Gilels Rach 3,"Gilels performance is a fantastic...emotional, human (the wrong notes are not edited out as many studio performances, but add to the drama making it more like a ""live"" recording). Minus is a ""crystal radio"" sound that bothers me throughout. Sounds almost like a low-bit MP3 download. I know its a 1955 recording but I still expected a little better quality on the sound."
4,"A wonderful adventure through France, history and a timely follow-up to ""Past Recall""","Nita Hughes has followed up her first book, ""Past Recall"" with another thriller that takes the reader on a fictional journey through church history and an exciting ride through France. In the ""Da Vinci Code"" genre, ""The Cathar Legacy"" continues the story in ""Past Recall"" where Hughes brings the Cathars and their history to life in a wonderful novel."
2,"Editor, wake up!","I am only one-third of the way through this book, which could be fascinating were it not for the grammar and punctuation errors. I am forced to re-read conversational paragraphs two and three times to determine who is speaking to whom."
2,Good ideas but bad (or no) editing,"The concept of this book and its predecessor, Past Recall, is interesting, but neither book looked as though it had been properly edited at all, which made it annoying to read at best and downright confusing, requiring backtracking to parse the author's meaning, at worst. I hope the author will avail herself of a professional editor in the future so that her work truly can shine. I offer my services."
2,My crritique,"I kept reading this book because of my interest in the subject, and in spite of two glaring disruptions that almost forced me to simply stop reading and toss the book away.Disruptions included too many grammerical errors and too many discriptions. The author, by describing hundreds of personal reactions (even in parts of a dialogue) severly limited the reader's imagination. In essense, her repeated descriptions, while well-meaning, placed me in handcuffs. All of the grammerical errors didn't helpThis seemed to me to be a second or third draft that required a lot more work. Time, research, action, editing, writing skills, rewrites. Then the book would really come to life, and become a part of history."
5,Manhunt pale's compared to this game.,"A friend of mine was approached by a subsidy of THQ for a lead-development position. One of the tasks they asked him to do in determining whether or not he was right for the position was to develop an entire level for The Punisher game. I was blessed to be able to witness a beta version of two levels of the game and let me tell you this. It makes Manhunt look like Super Mario Bros by comparison. I didn't get to actually play the game, however, from what I saw and as much as fun as it was to watch, this game is going to really make a mark. Putting people into woodchippers, dunking them in deepfryers. And the level detail and design is just beautiful. This is a must have!"
4,the story of truth,"Iloved it! It might not be so educational,but it's fun! i think this game should be with mature kids only."
3,GOOD OR BAD,ok here's the deal a punisher video gameGOODS1. complete man slaughter fun2. Many coll killing devices3. If u hate the comics does not mean you will hate thisBAD1. has NOTHING to do with the comics2. Really easy the punisher can so many bullets and yet he's only human atleast make it a little more realistic.Short but i hope it works all in all if u like man slaughter gamesu will like this =)
5,peer excellence,this game is defianatly a blood gut gore more more more as my motto must say. U can brutalize who ever u want and when. if u are racist the u must like hanging the black man towards the end of the game. this game is a lot of fun. u take control of this game in frank castles mind it is shear dominance. this is a must play
4,The Punisher,I really like this game. You can do all sorts of things in this game. I would recommend this game to all my fellow gamers.
4,Interogations,Very fun game. Decent graphics and good sound. Brutal interogations are very cool. Lots of replay value in upgradables and mission challenges. 4 out of 5 stars.
5,What do you call 125 murders in 5 years? A work in progress!,"This game is outstanding. Great story, excellent gameplay, everything the 2004 film wasn't-GRITTY, HARD, FOUL, VIOLENT, WITTY...this game is just great and you cannot beat the price. Do yourself a favor and buy this today."
5,excellent,"Great work, great album, great songs. Everything she is, is just ""great"". The ballads of the album are great. Her voice. Oh god! This gorgeous voice! ""still in love with you"" would do very good as a single, I think. Her performance at ""kick the habbit"" and ""no more the fool"" is brilliant. Nothing else I can say. Go out there and buy it..."
4,UNFAIR!,"THIS ALBUM WAS PRODUCED BY THE PRODUCERS OF CELINE DION, CHER AND ENRIQUE.WHY U NEVER HEARD OF IT? BECAUSE SONY REFUSED TO RELEASE IT IN THE REST OF THE WORLD PRIMARILY BECAUSE ANNA IS 44 YEARS OLD AND BELIEVED SHE COULDNT BE BIG.BIG MISTAKE. TRACKS LIKE 'STILL IN LOVE WITH U', 'MORO MOU'(MY BABY), 'EVERYTHING I AM', COVER VERSION OF ELKIE BROOKS'S 'NO MORE THE FOOL'(SHE DOES IT BRILLIANTLY) AND THE ORIGINAL 'ON A NIGHT LIKE THIS' BEFORE KYLIE'S SUPER REMIX ARE EQUAL AND SUPERIOR TO OTHER POP TRACKS!CHECK SOME GREAT DANCE TRACKS( TRACKS 6 AND 9) AND U WILL AGREE THAT AT LEAST SHE WAS WORTH A TRY.EXCELLENT VOICE AND A GREAT PERFORMER!SAVE THE best for last?'FORGIVE ME THIS'!"
2,Very dissapointed !!!!,"I first heard of Anna when i heard kylie's version of ""On a night like this"" that song is so great so when I found out that Anna was the first 2 sing it I had 2 hear it so i bought the CD and i was expecting more but it was a bomb. my advise dont waste your money....."
2,Kindle Edition Poorly Constructed,"On the quality of the other formats I cannot critique, but the Kindle edition is put together badly:- No formal table of contents (that you can jump to)- The table of contents (that one finds by scrolling through the book), links not to the text, but to the external Gutenberg project, which invokes the Kindle web browser.The annoyance of finding a particular poem was too great, and I returned it."
5,Better than I imagined.,"The arrival of this book came sooner than expected, which was very welcome, and the shipping packaging was very strong and sturdy. The book was in perfect condition, and is a beautiful edition of Keat's poems. Thank you. I couldn't have asked for more."
3,"Old ""skool' kung fu!!","After seeing the hype right here on amazon,,I rushed out to get this flick,,,,,it o.k,,,3 stars at best!! However, grossly over rated in my opinion. Of all the weapons you see in old school kung movies,,,there 's nothing special about stick fighting kung fu!! There 's no question the story is good,,the fight scenes good,,,however, you see one stick fights, and you see them all. Honestly,,after the first stick fight, there were no more suprizes in the flick, it got really boaring and predictable,,it only seemed and feel like the same scenes over and over repeating itself!!"
1,very disappointed,it is elevator music. i was expecting trumpet solo by Nini Rosso but there are some vocals. would not buy again or recommend
3,Not my favorite performance of Il Silenzio,"The absolutely most beautiful performance of Il Silenzio was by Melissa Venema, age 13, at a concert with Andre Rieu. My husband bought this CD by mistake, and Nini Rosso, while good, could not compare to the sound and feeling of Melissa Venema. I suggest listening to both before making your decision."
5,"P.C. M.D., How Political Correctness is corrupting medicine.","This is a fantastic book. It elucidates the degree to which Political Correctness is hurting patients, physicians and hospitals. Dr. Satel discusses ""scientific studies"", which do not hold up to peer scrutiny, but have been used by those with social agendas to support their ideals. She does not discount the fact that our environment affects our health and well being in certain instances; however, she does show that a much more important factor is personal responsibility for ones health maintenance. This book is especially meaningful to anyone involved in healthcare delivery or policy making. I highly recommend it."
1,Poor scholarship,"Satel acknowledges the ""first-rate"" scholarship of her graduate and medical teachers. I only speak to Chapter 2, ""Inmates Take Over the Asylum,"" in which I found six factual errors and a questionable judgement call. In fairness, Satel's paragraph about me correctly and fairly extracts from my 1997 article which Psychiatric Services published. But Satel allows Torrey, who most vilifies them, to define what survivors mean when they use the term (mental health) survivor about themselves (p 46). The National Association of Consumer/Survivor Mental Health Administrators (NAC/SMHA) is not a subcommittee of MadNation (p 46). Pat Deegan is not a Portland colleague (p 47). National Council on Disability (NCD) is the correct name (p 49). Subcommittee on Consumer/Survivor Issues is the correct name (p 53). The correct name is the Protection and Advocacy for Individuals with Mental Illness Act (p 57). There are 57 Protection and Advocacy programs, not 50 (p 57)."
1,Real people,"Her claim that ECT is not used because of PC concerns is incorrect. ECT is still a well used therapy, but the real problem with it is that it is based on the flimsiest of science. Foolish book by someone who herself clearly has a political agenda."
1,Student test book to be used with class room instruction,This is not a stand alone book. It has chapters to go alongwith some text book and only contains questions and multi choiceanswers. It has no instructional benefit. It could be used as a testbook for a class room or something but not a good choice for someone wanting to learn about machining unless one had the text book that goes with it.
3,"Functions great, doesn't last.","This a great pizza cutter to use. We bought it 4 months ago. It's safe. It cleans up easily, comes apart easily, and stores easily. It also cuts through pizza easily. We loved it. However, it broke the other day at the hinge where the two plastic, red cover parts rotate. There is a metal ""rivet"" in there. I don't know if somebody torqued it, or dropped it, or if it just wore out. No one in the ""chain of custody"" knows what happened to it.I'd be glad to pay $25 for one of these made out of aluminum that would not have that fatigue factor. In fact, I'm seriously considering a replacement, but as the saying goes ""Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me."""
2,Been through two now,"I've had two of these now; both of them broke. Nothing wrong with the blades, it's the plastic receptacle that the blade axle sits in. It always snaps. That being said, this is still the best pizza cutter out there, which is why I give it two stars instead of one. Just wish I could get an all metal one. Maybe I'll make my own; I've already got two blades to go in it . . ."
5,Awesome pizza cutter,"very sharp, easy to clean, worth the money to replace your old crappy pizza cutter."
5,Very Happy,"I ordered this item for Christmas, and wasn't so sure that it would arrive in time. But the item is terrific, and it came about 5 days after I ordered it. Thank you!"
5,Easy to use and clean!,"I love this pizza cutter! I am a weakling and with this, I can cut pizza easily without hurting my hands or arms! Cuts smoothly and without fussing. I like that it opens up and is easy too clean too. Great purchase!"
5,Zyliss Pizza Cutter,"First truly innovative kitchen product for pizza in a long time. Ergonomically friendly, and looks really snazzy. Amust have for the gourmand."
3,Could be a little sharper,"I like this style of pizza cutter and I was looking for something with a little more depth of cut given we eat Chicago deep dish pizzas. I was hoping for something a little sharper so I could use it on herbs, but it still works great on what it was designed for. Also works great to cut up sandwiches."
5,this is great!,My daughter had one of these so I had to find one too! It is very nice and easy to use too! Thank you for getting it to me so quickly!!Mary P/Wisconsin
2,"It's plastic, and it breaks.","The red housing cracks starting at the axle. Lasted a couple years though, which was better than Calphalon. I'd love it if these things weren't disposable, though."
4,"Poor Zyliss, once Swiss, now made in China","I used to adore all of my Zyliss stuff. That is, when their blades were made in Switzerland. Now, all of their products that I've seen are made in China. Quality suffers accordingly. I own the newer cheese grater because my gf and I broke up and she took it, but the new one is made in China. The roller blades don't quite fit as snugly.Regardless, the primary drawback of this pizza cutter is cleaning. It is very dangerous to separate the plastic handle in order to access the blade for cleaning. The blade has also become dull after only about 15 pizzas. It still pushes through the pizza, but since I don't have a circular sharpening tool, it no longer slices through it. Decent product overall."
1,broke after a couple of uses,"Everyone who I know had this pizza cutter loved it. However, this pizza cutter was difficult to open to clean. When I twisted it open, the plastic holder broke, rendering it useless. Will seach for a different design. I was disappointed. I like my other zyliss products."
1,broken,"I used this pizza cutter for several months and didn't love the design. I found it awkward to use, but it was sharper and made much better cuts than my previous cutters that I stuck with it. It was really difficult for me to open and clean, but again, I made do. I was cutting a pizza the other day and it snapped mid-swipe. I'll admit, I do make more than the average amount of homemade pizzas, so it stands to reason that a cheap plastic product was bound to wear out sooner rather than later. I'd recommend this if you're the occasional pizza maker but not for someone who makes so many pizzas the cutter might as well live by the stove. I'm going to replace it with a more substantial cutter (and yes, invest more than $10 in it) that has a more typical design."
3,Just OK,"This is a neat twist on a pizza slicer, but I prefer being able to see exactly where I'm slicing. The bulk of the slicer handle with your hand on top of it prevents you from seeing exactly where you are cutting."
1,Bad design is difficult to clean,"This pizza cutter is more difficult to clean than other normal ones because the pizza (or whatever you are cutting) gets caught inside the housing. Although it comes apart for cleaning, it's way more of a hassle (and a bit more dangerous) than a traditional style where you can just hold it by the handle and wash the blade."
3,Pizza Wheel,Haven't used yet but wish I had purchased the longer pizza cutter like used in the deli's. Anyway it looks like it would work fine.
5,Amazing,"This book is a page turner. I'm a huge fan of true crime but some books in print speak too much to the author's research and life and not the criminal's mind and life. This book gets to the nitty gritty, immediately and keeps you turning the pages."
3,Okay - but not great,"Author does not get as much information from the subjects as the title suggests. It talks more about the generalities of the crimes which is easily obtained from internet research. Also, the author give himself a lot of credit for his unsuprising findings - however, I find that most authors of true-crime non-fiction are that way. Gives information on little-known killers - ie: Carol Bundy."
3,mediocre,"This author is so full of himself! He talks about himself nearly as much as the killers. If anyone says they are an author, and writes a codenmed killer enough, they would probably be granted an interview too. I was disappointed in this book!"
3,eh,"I agree with previous reviewers that the book was pretty light on substance. The ""interviews"" were pretty much non-events. Aside from that, it was pretty interesting."
1,Horrible,Poorly written. A whole chapter is devoted to proclaiming the innocence of Ronald DeFeo Jr.(the man who murdered his whole family in Amityville).Don't waste your money. Or time.
3,Disappointing effort for McNamee,"Tucson resident Gregory McNamee has written some of the best eco-prose about the Southwest, such as _Gila: The Life and Death of an American River_. But this volume was a real disappointment. A collection of essays from Tucson Weekly, North Dakota Quarterly, and other reviews, this book doesn't achieve any sort of meaningful coherence. The large print and brevity (only 161 pages) means that no topic is covered in any depth. The low for me was a glimpse of Howard Hughes, based uncritically on a biography by Michael Drosnin (who has foisted the execrable Bible Code on a gullible public).This book doesn't give much bang for the buck. Avoid it, and get a paperback copy of _Gila_ instead."
3,Maybe Buy this DVD,Pretty Good Movie. Maybe if like this kind of movie. Maybe Buy this DVD. Happy Movie good Music also in DVD.
3,Picture This,"This movie is very unrealistic and Laughable. If you're looking for a cute teen movie to rent, this would not be the one.I know it's supposed to be ""fun,"" but the unrealisticness and the fast pace of the movie is a weak point. It gives off all the wrong messages (Lying is okay, you won't get caught, Revenge is okay) and whatnot. Not what I wanted when I was babysitting a family friend's four year old daughter.It moves too fast, the situations are completely laughable. This movie seems to be written for three different age groups as well.Skip it. Go see Dark Knight, a real movie."
5,Truly beautiful,"Perhaps I'm odd, but the images in this deck make it very easy for me to work with. I find it a wonderful deck for doing readings with, and I deeply enjoy just working with this deck. The artwork is wonderful and really speaks to me. (I'm 33) I do with the creator would perhaps write a companion book explaining which tales etc she used for each card and why... but that's my innate curiosity speaking."
5,Good book: complements Harold McCormick's book,"Good book. Interviews with Jurgen Oesten complement Harold J. McCormick's ""Two Years Behind the Mast: An American Landlubber at Sea in World War II."" Anyone who has read that book knows that Commander Oesten sunk McCormick's Liberty ship on July 23, 1944. For some reason, however, McCormick's book is not cited in Vause's bibliography"
3,germ breeding ground,i bought the blow pens without realizing that germs just sit in the pens and when the kids switch colors they also exchange each others germs. i threw them out.
1,did not get the blow pens that were decribed,I spent $35 on a kit that was worth $10. I got 7 blow pens (not even the colors listed on the box I received) that looked used and dried out. The box came to me damaged. The item did not even look like the one presented in the ad or as descibed in the ad. The contents inside were dusty and had nothing that I paid for inside. It was as if it were already opened. I am a Huge customer of Amazon.com and I have experiened my first amazon rip off.
5,not a (real) kid!,"i am an artist; i make a lot of greeting cards. i have found blo-pens to be a lot of fun and i have been very creative with them. i found that i do better when i use my own stencils, and i have experimented a lot with the pens. my frustration is not being able to find just the pens, except for the ""bold"" colors, which i do not need. and i don't like the color change pens (the colors are blah, as far as i'm concerned). would love to know how to find an assortment of pens."
4,Be careful - the ink stains!,"This ink runs through paper, so be sure and cover the surface your child is working on and make sure they wear old clothes. This ink stains, and some colors come out but others don't. Our kids enjoyed Blopens so much we couldn't keep them away from it, to our home's detriment. You'll be in for an unfortunate surprise if your child decides to sit on the floor over carpet or at a table with a tablecloth while using these pens. We were surprised that a company would make a child's toy like this with ink that won't easily wash out. Just something to consider before buying."
5,Refill Blo-Pens,"I'm only 13 and I don't have a baby i just like looking at the stuff but i know where you can find refills. I'm not sure if you Michael's Arts and Crafts Stores in New York, NY but we do in Kansas. You can look in the kid's crafts section. They should have them near markers and kid's paints. Hope it helped."
5,The band are now a 3 piece!,"Flight 16 had a real bad time with Sony and then Sanctuary Management. They are still together but now main writer Paul Obertelli fronts the band and they are really sounding cool!They have got a new management and have started to get some feed back from some labels, so fingers crossed they will be doing another record! ..."
5,Brilliant in all regards.,"This 90 minute DVD is as engaging as it is informative... the producers made this story simple enough for school age children to grasp and yet provocative enough for adults to want to learn more. I always wonder HOW in the world could dinosaurs carcasses decaying under the sea have produced more than a trillion barrels of oil??? Dang, I mean really, how many dinosaurs were there? Then in a straight forward way this DVD answered the HOW of oil creation.... also, it concludes by reminding us of the consequences of our planet's oil addiction. Brilliant. Highly Recommended for all ages."
3,could have been better,"this movie could have been better.if it had more monkey&mantis;fighting style.lets start with the good.first the quility wasgood,gordon lui hosted the movie,which was good.the fighting was o.k,but it could have been better.now the bad,notenough monkey & mantis,only five min,thats all. this movie a.k.a mantis& the monkey shadow.thats why i brought this movie.if you looking for mantis or monkey fighting don't buy this moviei should know. i know kung fu!"
4,Rounding Out an Enya Collection,"I've never been big on singles, but I'm glad I stumbled upon this one. The title track was only available on ""Paint the Sky with Stars"" (one of those 'collections plus two new tracks' that tend to irritate long-time fans) and is a nice addition. A number of people have compared it to her first hit ""Orinoco Flow"", and it's true they are both upbeat, lyrical songs. But I think ""Only If"" has a much stronger rhythmic quality to it, almost a march if that's not going too far out on a limb! ""Willows on the Water"" (previously unreleased) is an instrumental piece that's uplifting, but more flowing than the first track. And things slow down even further with her beautiful rendition of Silent Night (previously only found on ""The Christmas EP""). Her Gaelic translation is divine and well worth the price of the entire disc."
2,Defective out of the box,"Followed the directions to the letter for installation. Have used other toner brands in the past with no problems. Toner leaves four extraneous dots on every page. Talked with representative from TonerSpot who offered to accept item back for full refund (including shipping. So, at least they are making good on the purchase."
2,"Good martial art actors, bad movie","I purchased this movie because it stared two computant fight movie actors Phillip Ko and Cassanova Wong aspecially Phillip Ko who has done some great work over the years. Casssanova Wongs work in Warriors Two and North South Shaolin was very impressive. In this movie the action is badly choragraphed and the movie is stuck in the insta,action mode, Phillip Ko only appears in one fight and is quickly dispensed. The movie has plenty of action but I found it hard to sit through maybe its a good thing that the DVD it stuck in the insta action mode I could'nt watch the hold movie."
1,Pop wannabe Metal,This CD definately has a pop wannabe sound to it.This album was terrible.OZ should have produced it on there own.Sounds like pop the same mistake Twisted Sister made and the same downfall.Roll the Dice is coffin nails.
1,Don't Bother,"My purchased Belkin USB 4X1 Peripheral Switch sits in a box in my garage never having worked correctly. I tried, my IT people tried, and Belkin's troubleshooter people tried to get it to work connecting a scanner with 2 computers without luck. Finally, one of the reps at Belkin said - rather casually - it may be a bad switch, send it back, and they would send another. They never sent me the information to send back the it. I went with Belkin because I wanted a quality product. I made a mistake. I bought one from a different manufacturer at half the price, and it works perfectly."
5,great,i work at a company that uses so many different printers this will allow me to connect them all and use only one and cut down on ink/toner
2,Using SD128M with Magellan Meridian Platinum GPS,"First of all, I'm not sure where the problem is but this card did not work with my Meridian GPS. It could have been either device. My GPS was shipped from Amazon.com with software rev. 3.05. 3.05 does not support 128Meg memory. Magellan sent to me a CD with rev 3.08 which should support the 128Meg card. If it dose, it sure dosen't work in my Meridian Platinum.As for the GPS unit itself, it's very nice and Magellan customer support is outstanding. I feel it is not fully intagrated into the Magellan software suite of products. There are too many work-arounds and bandaids to get the system to work. I'll purchase the 32M or the 64M card and hope for better results..."
2,Viking SD card really slow,I have found that writing to the Viking SD 128 card to be extremely slow. Copying a 10 Mb file took 10 minutes. Ugh.
1,Slower than molasses--until I formatted it.,"NOTE TO EVERYONE WHO IS HAVING PROBLEMS WITH THIS CARD--I reformatted it in my camera and it works fine now!!Initially I wrote:I was very disappointed in the shot-to-shot speed with this card (using a Minolta Xg). The Panasonic card that came with the camera, which I thought would be cheap, is THREE TIMES FASTER than this ""upgrade"". This card is useless to me as it cripples the camera I bought it to work in. It takes FOURTEEN SECONDS from one shot to the next with this card. With the original card, it's less than four seconds. The claim that this is a ""high speed"" card is dishonest. This is the slowest card I've ever used. I will throw this card away rather than curse someone else with it."
4,Easy as pie.,I didn't have a single issue with this product. It was easy to use and the sound is perfect.
1,Never worked in my iPAQ,"After waiting several weeks for the 128MB SD card to arrive, I finally got it. Gleefully I inserted it into my Compaq iPAQ's SD slot and -- pffftttttttttt. Nothing. Nothing at all. I got an error dialog box saying the card was unrecognizable... Didn't even allow me to format it or anything...I have had no problems with my SanDisk 64MB SD card."
3,Slow. Slow. Did I say slow?,"I bought this card as a spare memory for my Casio 5MP digicam.The original memory that I got free as a bonus with the camera wasbranded Edge and also has 128MB on it. The first thing I did whenI got the Viking card was of course insert in into the camera and seeif it works. It sure did, but I immediately noticed that it is quitea bit slower than Edge. Maximum resolution pictures produce filesabout 2.5MB in size and it took good 4-5 seconds to record them tothis Viking card. Add to that 2-3 seconds that camera takes for imageprocessing and you get whopping 7-8 seconds from shot to shot.For comparison with the Edge card it is 4-5 seconds. Still a lot, but notas frustrating.The only plus - Viking is cheap from many retailers, and rebates are oftenavalable.My advice: if you need SD memory for digital photography at high resolutionget a card with guaranteed high transfer rate - at least 5MB/sec.You'll have to pay more, but it is worth it."
1,Wont play ...[some] files,"Guess what they dont mention? This product contains the hated RIAA secure digital music initiative ie it wont play all of the .mp3 that you downloaded. Read this quote from news.com""However, not everyone considers such security a step forward. Secure Digital includes software that complies with Secure Digital Music Initiative standards protecting against unauthorized replication of copyrighted content. As a result, digital-audio files downloaded from music services,... cannot be played on devices that use Secure Digital cards""In short you will only be able to use this with the RIAA approved songs and only as long as you pay the monthly fee. NO THANKS!"
2,Watch Satriani treat Manu Katché like an ANIMAL!!!!,"Manu Katché, one of the best drummers you could hire, is pretty much crapped on by Joe Satriani regarding his song ""Luminous Flesh Giants."" Manu does takes that even the producer is complimenting and Satriani, in some kind of old-man stubbornness, just cannot get past the fact Manu is not playing a boring retarded-simple 4/4 beat. He ends up firing him and the producer's SON takes over! What's VERY funny is how Manu smiles while taking criticism as if to say, ""You do know I just got done yet another tour with Peter Gabriel, right?""For musicians, the movie should be viewed as a comedy, and a cautionary tale to any musician who thinks they're too good to take advice or suggestions from ANYONE, regardless if it is their own project or not. Joe Satriani should be ASHAMED of this footage. I sure as hell would be."
3,The Satch Tapes,"I justed watched it a few times. I would like everyone to know that it is really just a documentary, and it doesnt show much shots of him playing as it does talking. I liked it however, its nothing to make a big deal over."
2,Meh.,"Much smaller than I thought it would be, that's ok though, easier to fit in a pocket. What I don't like is the final coat of paint seems to have glued it all together. making it very hard to open and close. Very irritating, tossed it in a drawer."
5,Dreams become a horrible reality to a disallusioned youth.,"Curtis wanted to travel, fight for his country, and so he joined the army. His adventure turned into horrible reality when he faced death, bigotry, ill treatment, not only from the enemy but from his fellow Americans. The young boy only 17 grew up fast. Like others tears were shed in silence. Love came only in the arms of a girl who sold herself to survive. War wasn't glamorous. It was truly Hell. The heroes were those that survived. Curtis questioned the role of ""Blacks"" in wars they didn't start but were forced to finish in order to survive. I enjoyed the book and for a woman to enjoy a story about war says a lot for his style of writing."
5,The Rock Island Boys,"The Rock Island Boys did the song ""California"" and the title track for the album, ""Remember The Beach"". Both are great sounding tracks that remind you of The Beach Boys."
1,Absolutely terrible,"NIGHT, DAWN and MARTIN are classic films which will be cherished as long as there are sentient creatures around who enjoy films. DAY, LAND and SEASON are pretty damn good films, as well. This is even worse than KNIGHTRIDERS. A stupid idea, poorly done. Beware of any film with a morose, philosophical voice-over. This is obviously Granpa Romero's take on these darn kids with their new-fangled gadgets that gots 'em so plugged in them l'il varmints cain't tell the difference between reality and nonsense. The insights offered are about as deep as Bush's sympathy for the poor, the gore is pathetic and the premise and execution are hard to sit through. This features some of the dumbest, preachiest and most heavy-handed dialog of any film in recent memory. Let's hope the next one is better."
5,One of the best zombie movies I've seen,"During a zombie outbreak a group of college students struggles to make it home to find their families. They encounter all sorts of disasters on their way.Even though this is a typical zombie film, it's one of the best I've seen. I think it's up there with Resident Evil and 28 Days Later. It's a different sort of approach to the overdone zombie apocalypse theme. The students are video taping their entire journey. They see what others have done on the web, and coordinate their plans accordingly. If you like zombie films this movie should really make you happy. I definitely think it's a keeper. The sequel is really good too."
3,Good Shi-,Cant complain. Its very low budget and excellent for being that. Only downfall was... for a total zombie apocolypse there werent very many zombies in the movie. Whats the explanation for that?
1,"""Some"" nice effects one star.","Hello World,Keep it short, big remero fan here but... this movie had a very unlikeable cast and very little entertainment value. Land of the dead wasnt that good but certainly more entertaining this. It seemed thrown together and depressing as hell, felt like putting my head in the oven! I know horror flix are not uplifting but there was just something really unlikable about this movie. But what do I know I just sell beer.Thx for reading!"
2,Boring!!,Lame acting and the the same story again. It was too long for a very stupid ending . Safe your money and pass on this one.
5,Underrated,"I do not know why the reviews of this movie are so mixed. In some ways I think this is Romero's best aside from ""Night."" The characters are engaging and thoroughly dislikable. The factor that they trigger such little compassion as they strugglenot so much to survive as to document shows the superficialities of a society overwhelmingly drawn to ""reality"" TV while being thoroughly detached from reality and from themselves. It is a great message about escpaism in its most superfluous form. Who really are the zombies of the film? Who is really dead? The detached characters who are stumbling automatons devoid of any connection to their own humanity?"
2,COME ON!!!!,"Given that Mr. Romero has made four previous films based on the zombie apocalypse, it is puzzling that he decides to go the route of a plodding cast with no chance of being remembered. The strength of previous actors prevented the other movies from falling into outright farcical material; the actors were flawed yet endearing. This film has the viewer hoping that the actors will die in hopes that a better movie is in the making.Recent zombie fanfare has taken the satire out of the genre, therefore an underlying diluting of the concept. It is my hope that better research can be done to prevent Japanese people from giving advice on killing zombies: Japan has a no gun policy, so shooting is out of the question. Oh. my goodness, this should be forgotten."
2,"In two words, it's just a bad movie","The only good thing about this film is that it shows the insight on the today's human nature. Like when national guards rob the people on the road and when hunters practice shooting on dead women and men with different kind of weapons. ''Are we worth saving''? The movie could be done much better in the same style. I have nothing to say about actors, but that they were okay. This movie gives away no atmosphere and it's an okay choice to spend 1 hours. I don't agree with the cover for the movie, where it says ''masterpiece''. It is Romero's worst movie to be done."
1,I HAD high hopes for this film...,"Unfortunately, this film was terrible in all regard. I'm a huge fan of Romero and most of his ""...Dead"" movies. I desperately wanted to love this film. I can not even like it.The script was ridiculous and the acting was terrible. Hey, Romero, enough with the insipid social commentary. Just make a film we can watch and enjoy."
1,Barf!!!,"I got this for $9 and i STILL feel ripped off!!! The whole interview perspective of the movie was VERY annoying!!! Bad actors didnt help it either! I stopped watching the movie 3/4 thru. I LOVE Zombie movies but stay away from this one! If your looking for a good Zombie movie try the original Dawn of the Dead (the remake is pretty good too), Night of the Living Dead, 28 days/weeks later...i apologize to Romero about the bad remarks but this movie SUCKS!"
1,Great Concept But this movie really sucks...,"The storyline is your average run of the mill zombie story, very interesting concept though. Also very boring."
1,Total Boring Garbage,"This is one of the most stupid and boring horror movies I've ever seen! George Romero should have quit making zombie movies after he made ""Dawn of the Dead"". The acting is bad, the plot is lame, and is it really necessary for him to scum bag the Army National Guard? He did the same thing in ""Day of the Dead"", his poor excuse of a sequel to ""Dawn of the Dead""."
3,"Not bad, not great, either","Decided to watch this for no other reason than I've seen all of Romero's other ""Dead"" movies; I found myself mildly entertained but nothing here really crossed any new territory. It's a zombie movie with the usual gore and characters being bumped off and the usual Romero social commentary (presumably on the 24/7 media and how it's manipulated) and uh...well, that's about it. I'll give points for the Amish farmer (that was a pretty unique segment) but can't say much else ""jumped out"" at me. Worth seeing if you've followed the ""Dead"" series so far, but not a film you'll miss anything if you choose to pass it up."

2,An awful attempt that could've been good,"Simply put--this starts out terribly and continues to spiral downward. You have college students making an amateur film that's, get this, a horror film. Strike one right there. Romero could've made this believable like Cloverfield did--make them doing something else, something normal, like simply filming a retreat on a camcorder. Plus, when the dead start to come to life, the band of students don't even act scared. The only normal response was by one girl who attempts suicide...and hey, what do you know, she comes back as a zombie. They go to a hospital, and no one's there. So what do they do? They scream ""Hello?"" Slap a big label on these losers that says, ""Zombie dinner"". I dunnno--normal people would be freaking out really bad if this was happening. But these kids stand around and say, quite calmly, ""What do you want to do?"" I'm givning it two stars because the first ten minutes are pretty intense. But that's all you get. It's a struggle to get through."
3,"Mediocre, at best - but better than Land","George's message regarding the media, consumerism, etc, are boring at best and excessively irritating & overblown at worst. I did like the new take on amateur-type style but over-all it became unbelievable and only a gimmick that proved a liability in my mind about half way through. Maybe nobody can make a great Zombie movie any longer after all the crap out there, including Land of the Dead. Maybe Zombie flicks (good ones at least) are dead when Romerro can't even make them anymore."
1,Diary of the Dead = boring,"i love zombie movies. resident evil, 28 days, dawn of the dead, etc... but this movie is terrible. it sucks so bad that i actually feel bad for George A. Romero.the premise of this movie makes no sense, the acting sucks, special effects are lame, it's not scary, not funny, preachy about the presence of cameras in society, and just plain boring. even if you love the horror movie genre, you will still hate this movie. that's how lame it is.so just to review, you wont care about the characters, the plot, the special effects and you will be bored.this movie made less than $600k. it was a huge bomb."
1,Diary Of The Dull,"Here we are at Romero's 4th zombie outing. He presents us with the worst actors possible, a trite script and abysmal editing. Oh and did i mention THE WORST ACTORS! This film makes ""Land"" look like a masterpiece. Find a copy of the Spanish film (REC) instead. (REC) is everything Diary should have been."
3,"Average Zombie fun, Could have been better, could have been worse.","I liked this movie. It was a Romero zombie film. Was it perfect, not really. Was it good, well, yes. The zombies were great, the acting was pretty good. ALl in all it was a good movie. Nothing to write home about but nothing to make fun of.Remember, this was the first days of the outbreak. There werent zombies all over yet. There were pockets here and there. The students might have never seen zombies but they happened to hit zombie central.The story was good, as stated before. If you want to watch a good zombie movie watch it. If you are expecting perfection, go elsewhere."
2,too much dialogues,well i like very much all the zombies of romero but this time i didn't like it at allfirst i don't like the way of filming like blair witch and coverfieldand second we can sleep watching this movie it speak too muchi think romero is finish and it is very sad
1,Boy oh Boy,"I collect horror movies and I even love most of the cheesy ones. I usually expect good things from Mr. Romero and I was curious as to how he would pull of the camera documentary part of the movie. Well the fact of the matter is that he did not pull it off. This movie is an interesting concept that had the worst scrip I have ever even heard of anyone writing. This is probably the worst movie I have ever seen. Through the whole movie, the hero is pointing his camera at the action while his friends are being mauled by zombies. At one point the hero is yelling ""CUT, CUT, CUT,"" at a zombie that used to be an actor to try and save some girl instead of bashing it in it's decomposing head with the camera. This movie's only redeeming quality is that it is a great flick to watch while drinking with some friends and making fun of it, because it is absolutely terrible. The whole video diary format is just too limiting for a survival horror movie. Save yourself some cash and avoid this one."
2,Diary of the Dead DVD Review,"I've enjoyed all of the other Mr. Romero's ""Dead"" films; however, this one is not good at all; I found it quite boring. The widescreen DVD has high-quality picture and sound."
2,Weak entry in the zombie canon,"The Bottom Line:With weak acting, poor special effects and little-to-no narrative thrust, Diary of the Dead is a poor film by any standards (regardless of when Cloverfield was released) that hopefully won't be mentioned alongside Romero's much better other ""Dead"" films; with basically one good sequence (the encounter with the black survivalists), a terrible voiceover narration and little-to-no suspense, this is sadly just not a good movie.2/4"
1,DONT BELEAVE THE HYPE......,"I wanted to love this movie. I was very happy when i got the last copie at the H.M.V yesterday knowing that today i was off work + the wife was not home. I closed the curtains, pop up the DVD and waited to be impressed once again by one of the best in the game mr Groege A. Romero. When i first heard of the script i got to say i was not convince that it would work and after watching this movie....it doesent ! Sorry George, i loved Dawn and i thought that Day was the best (night of the living was ground breaking at the time) and i really think of it as the trilogy of the dead. Land & Diary has nothing to do with them. Were is the good soundtrack (i miss goblin) ?? Were is the good F-X ??? (by the way cgi in this movie stinks and the gore .... i miss tom savini !!!) I can honestly say that i did not like one thing about this movie and glad that i paid 15$ only and im not anxious at all for Diary part 2 !ps: Cloverfield was way better !"
2,Extremely dissapointing. 2.5 stars.,"As a longtime Romero fan I've been anticipating this release for quite a while, and I have to say this movie makes Land of the Dead seem like a masterpiece. How this movie has been getting the rave reviews I've been reading is beyond me. It's filmed really well but all that is completely destroyed by atrocious acting. The documentary style comes off as really corny and it just seems really unoriginal to me. And the satire? Don't get me started.Tips to Romero if he decides to make another entry in the series:- GO BACK TO BLACK AND WHITE!!!!!- Ditch the teen actors!!!!- No more GGI!!!!!I'm gonna go cry now."
2,Dear Diary; I Think I'm Starting to Suck...,"Although I've enjoyed the other George Romero 'Living Dead' films, I don't have much to say about DIARY, except that George must have made this one for the money. Honestly, it is SERIOUSLY lame compared to earlier efforts. There are some well-done FX shots, but the pseudo-Blair Witch approach doesn't make it, the characters are flat, to say the least, and Romero's trademark social satire is out to lunch. One could say that the proliferation of zombie knockoff films has taken the edge off, but (let's face it) there is really no edge left anymore. And if DIARY is meant as a spoof, as some people insist, it misses the mark there as well. Forget the glowing reviews from FANGORIA and elsewhere, as those clowns have endorsed a lot of truly horrendous junk over the years. Just re-watch George Romero's original trilogy and remember how really good those films still are."
4,addition to zombie movie collection,A great addition to any zombie movie collection. Nobody does zombie films better than George A. Romero. Clever zombie kills and surprises. Not as good at the Dawn of the Dead series but a fun watch.
1,This was awful,"Let me say ..I was a huge fan of Dawn of the Dead and Day of the Day..But this is utter garbage,,Why?? Terrible story and terrible acting..the ""Blair Witch"" thing is very old..I was hoping the characters would all be eaten by Zombies, because they were so annoying..Some of the special effects were ok..It looks like there were on a strict budget in places..Don't even bother renting it.."
5,My Son Loved This Book,My 10 year old son who doesn't like to read loved this history based mystery. It was great to see him reading without me asking him to read. I read the book as well Dan Gutman did a great job of mixing an interesting story with history.
4,can't complain but ouch....,"They are pretty tight and short....however achieve their purpose.They seem quite strong as they required a fair effort and help to apply, they were none the worse for wear.A good value and a good product for most a bit small for some."
1,2 broke out of first 30 used,They are just not reliable. 2 broke out of first 30 used.Break too often.Break too often!I got them from Green Web Inc. through Amazon.
3,Unsure,"My issue with this item is that they were not in their original box. That is a little scary, considering it is condoms. Kinda freaks me out a bit to use them."
3,"package is broken +made in Thailand"" .","it doesn't say that the outer package is broken, neither does it mention that this product is not a whole sealed package. Instead they are put into one plastic bag without any production description.Nevertheless, it is surprising to find that "" made in Thailand"" ."
2,not good,They are too thick which greatly reduce my comfort. My girl is also not satified with them. They are not good as the jissbon ones I used before. I am very disappointed with durex.
5,Reccomended By a Redditor,"After getting a reccomendation from a redditor on a replacement for trojan magnums, I procured these and the Okimono Crowns. I was pleased with both purchases although the fact that the Okimono come with so little lubricant means I will just be ordering these next time. Cheers."
1,DO NOT BUY!!!,"Do not buy this product, first of all they are not close to the rival trojan magnum in size or comfort, but most importantly not in reliability. The first condom out of the package we used broke, I went through them with my hand trying to break them, it was fairly easy to break a good amount of them, tried the same thing with a trojan got it all the way up my arm still didn't break. I would not buy this product unless you are wanting a pregnancy in your future...or an STD."
5,awesome,"best condoms ive tried yet. a little more room goes a long way. nice lubricant too, with a slightly sweet smell"
4,Love,"Not sure how to review these.....Excellent fit and feel. Used Trojan magnum previously as a comparison. Good lubrication etc, 4/5 I'd say."
5,My favorite type,These particular type are my favorite condoms. They do not have a strong odor and do not have a plastic-y feel.
1,WHATS THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,What is this. This sounds nothing like Dallas Taylor(used to be lead singer for Underoath-Act of Depression). This is him? THIS SUCKS. DONT GET IT. If you want a good cd get Act of Depression by Underoath(when they were good).
1,"YEEA WE ARE SOUTHERN, RIGHT ON, YEEAA BRO!","what a joke this band is. from the overplayed southern theme to the chihuaha-esque barking of frontman dallas taylor this album blows on all cylinders. it is pure blasphemy to compare this band to their label mates the showdown or masters of the southern metal riff, pantera. there is nothing southern about monroe piercings, poison the well tees, and straightened hair boys. the music DOES have its southern moments (even though they are elementary at best), and the layout by asterik does do the band SOME justice, but this is highly overshadowed by the fact that their frontman fails misreably like he once did in a little known band called underoath (who have somehow managed to get worse since). bottom line: i know this dallas guy will make this record sell a few more albums than it normally would, but what a terrible sign for a label trying to make a name for itself."
5,Perfect for the non sewer,"I am not a susie homemaker and only use a sewing kit for random buttons or slight tears in clothing. This is PERFECT for that. Everything I need to do ""small touch up jobs"". Thread is good quality and the case is easy to keep in a bathroom drawer for easy storage and EASY to find! Not a bad item!"
5,Great Sewing Kit for a Traveler,Item was just as described. I travel alot and always seem to need to replace a button or repair a hem. This is perfect for that!
3,Decent travel kit,I was looking for a a travel sewing kit and came across this one. The colors are basic but the needles are cheap and bend with almost every fabric type. Its fine in a pinch but not a kit you would want in your home.
1,very poor,"I was wondering why my platic case had scotch tape on it. When I opened it, I noticed it was holding the lid to the case and the plastic hindges were so fragile that it was broken but they shipped it anyways. I payed three times what I would pay at Walmart and Target, all I wanted was good quality because the reviews were pretty good. This product is cheap inside and out and worst of all, OVER PRICED."
2,Cheap,"The lid snapped off during transit. The thread is fine, so if you're only buying it for the thread and needles, then it's fine, but don't expect the travel case to stand up to any amount of stress during travel. It's made of cheap plastic."
3,Plastic case damaged upon delivery,When the sewing kit arrived its carrier box was scotch taped closed; I quickly found out that without that tape the box will not snap closed as designed. I'd intended to occasionally travel with it but that now looks unlikely. I need to store it flat as well for this reason... And I hope I never drop it!
4,Good sewing kit horrible box,"This sewing kit is a good kit to have around for minor repairs. I bought it so that I would have needles and thread to fix buttons and small tears in my clothing, and the color selection is fairly complete. The only problem is the box containing the kit is cheep and doesn't stay closed. The box works fine if you are going to put the kit in a drawer somewhere, but if you plan to use the kit for travel, the contents are going to end up all over your bag."
3,"Excellent rare footage, let down by MamaMia hype","If you are looking for a true ABBA history DVD, then skip this. Unfortunately there is no true ABBA history DVD around, so keep waiting. If you can't wait, this one will provide you with some very rare footage of the band in their early days, including solo projects. For example, Anna rehearsing for a part in the Swedish version of 'Jesus Christ Superstar'. But this 'documentary' was clearly made to tie-in with the London premiere of the musical 'Mama Mia - the Musical', and focusses alot on that - obviously a marketing exercise (yawn!). By the way, I didn't enjoy Mama Mia the Musical as much as I expected to."
5,ABBA: Behind the Music!,"This was the story I always wanted to see as an ABBA fan... what was REALLY going on. Little did I know that those songs told the story.... ""Knowing Me, Knowing You"" and ""The Winner Takes it All"" take on a new significance now that I've seen this documentary. My heart broke for Agnetha, and I cried as I watched it. The old footage is too precious, and those songs.... oh, there's just nothing like ABBA ever!!! This DVD is a must-have if you're an ABBAphile... I was so glad I got it!"
1,Don't waste your money.,I am very disappointed with this dvd. There is not one song that is not interrupted by dialog about the history of abba. I would have bought the dvd if I knew this.
2,Gold testing,The gold testing kit review: It is difficult to use. It is not what I expected but will keep working with it til I hopefully figure it out.
1,mistake,"When I recieved the gold test kit there was a missing bottle of the 10k, but I got a extra 14k instead."
2,Kit doesn't come with a silver testing needle.,"Kit doesn't come with a silver testing needle. The instructions said to ""make a parallel scratch with a .99 silver needle"" but didn't come with one to do so."
5,Great Kit.,Great kit to grade metals. A must have for any of you metal detector people out there. So glad I ordered it.
5,Tests all common precious metals,"This is a handy kit to test all common precious metals. So far I've only used it to test a couple of grades of gold, but it is easy to use. I'm glad that the test stone was included."
3,Gold testing Kit,"The product appears to work. Kit is sort of a misnomer, I built a box to store the components. The instruction are near impossible to read even with a fairly good magnifying glass."
3,Ok deal!,I like all of the acids you get and they are big bottles too. The big downside is the stone is useless. I have to buy a stone that will allow the material to leave a mark on it.
1,Be Careful,"We used the test kit to identify a small pile of unmarked gold, sold it on eBay and the customer was satisfied. Next three lots of scrap didn't come out so well. Despite carefully following the (somewhat minimal) instructions that came with the kit, and repeating the test several times, the eBay buyers informed us that we had made a mistake and they wanted their money refunded (naturally we waited until we received the returns and made absolutely certain the buyers had returned the exact same items sold.) Besides the obvious ""all that glitters is not gold"", we learned that it takes lots of practice and possibly even expert instruction to test gold."
1,"Maybe you should tell people it's an electroplate test, you think?","Maybe the seller should actually go to sell a piece or gold or two after testing, they perform an entirely different test. They scratch the piece and place the acid directly onto the piece if it bubbles then it is electroplate, if it rolls off then it is Gold as marked, really how can you just scratch the surface of anything and tell if it is actually pure or not, especially onto a black stone and be expected to tell what color its changing. What a waste of time and money not to mention the amount that was charged to ship, more expensive than the kit itself. Don't buy this!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,just what you need for testing gold and silver,This precious metal testing kit is one of the best I have ever used. The acid tests perfect and the stone is of good quality. The best thing about this well priced testing kit is the total package. Will buy another after I use this. And remember you get Silver and Platinum test also.
4,Good Product,"When my dog, a Labrador Retriever, started to show signs of arthritic pain I wanted to give him Glucosamine, and this is the product I've been giving him for the past year. It seems to be working. He is limping less and less often. This is an easy to administer medication too. My dog loves to chew these tables. But then again, he'll chew and eat almost anything you give to him."
1,Opened product,This is my second review. First one has disappeared. Received this is box where both bottles were wide open. Caps were on bottom of box and half of pills were laying loose in box. Powder from pills over everything. Bottles looked like they were never sealed or had been opened. Found same product on another site $5.00 cheaper even with shipping and delivered promptly.
1,Dissatisfied.,I have a greyhound who will eat anything. He will not eat this product. I have to bury it under peanut butter on a chunk of bread to get it down his throat.I will not buy this again.
4,Great product,Arrived quickly and all the pills were in tact. The only reason I removed a star is because my dog hates the taste. I have to crush them up in her food and put meat on top for her to eat them.
5,Works great for my dog!!,"I have been using the NaturVet Glucomamine DS for over a year now. My 12 year old cocker spaniel has some arthridis in her hips and this works really well. It's nice that she will eat the pill with out having to ""hide"" it in her food. The price is also a great value!"
5,NaturaVet Glucosamine ROCKS!,"I put my 7yr. old Bernese Mt. Dog on this early last year. She was having episodes of limping and getting lazy.I put her on NaturaVet Glucosmine DS with Chondroitin and she is like a 2yr. old puppy. I almost took her offit because she was too active :) (Just kidding) It really has worked Miracles. Try it, your animal will Love youall the more for it!"
5,great!,"I got this movie for my son because he is going through this Scooby-Doo stage now. He absolutely LOVES it!! I may end up having to buy another one if he keeps watching it at the rate that he is, he's gonna wear it out, lol."
1,Worst Scooby Doo movie ever!,"I am an absolute Scooby Doo fan and I have been watching Scooby Doo cartoons since 1974. I currently own 7 Scooby Doo DVDs with 3 more on order. However, Reluctant Werewolf has got to be the worst Scooby Doo movie ever! It totally departs from the Scooby Doo formula of solving mysteries and unmasking bad guys in monster suits.Instead, this movie is about Scooby, Shaggy, Scrappy and Googie entering a road race with monsters. The whole movie is about the dumb road race from beginning to end and nothing else. The rest of the Mystery Inc. gang like Fred, Daphne, Velma and even the Mystery Machine have been completely left out.As a Scooby Doo fan I feel totally disappointed and cheated. I advise all Scooby fans to stay clear away from this disaster."
1,TERRIBLE - a repackaged movie from the worst in American animation,My family is a big fan of the new Scooby Doo movies - we also love the original series. This movie falls somewhere in-between as a really crummy homage to the Wacky Races. This is a really crummy movie and your kids will be bored to tears. Try the Loch Ness Monster movie or the one about the Mummy - both are awesome.
1,Just Awful!,"Truly a disgrace to the Scooby Doo tradition. Bad jokes, bad animation, stupid monsters, annoying support characters like Googy. (God forbid they even made Shaggy a little annoying this time.) Horrible, meandering plot, no mystery to solve, and no Fred, Daphne and Velma to help them even if there was one. And what's with Shaggy's ORANGE SHIRT? Shaggy should never be in anything but a green shirt and that's all there is to it. Even my three year old son who lives for Scooby Doo won't watch this one anymore."
3,Really old one,"They updated the cover, so I thought this was one of the newer movies, but it is one of the really old 70's videos. The kids still liked it, but the cover was misleading.."
