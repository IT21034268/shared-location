2,Great - until it breaks,"Randomly unplugged it to move some peripherals around - plugged it back in and it didn't work. The light only flashes briefly as you try to plug in the power adapter. Did some research and apparently this is a common issue - and the customer service at RCA leaves you SOL. Buy another brand - from the research I did of other people with the same issue, my set lasted the longest - and that's only five months."
1,Transmitter burns out...,"The wireless transmitter burned out, even on a surge protector. RCA customer service on this product is practically nonexistent. Buy something else, this product is not worth the money or effort to get replacement parts."
1,Broken Transmitter,The system transmitter broke after 6 days of use. I'm in the process of getting a refund.
2,Well they work...,I bought these a while ago and when they work the sound is pretty good.But the problem is that you often get random pops and static from RF interference. You can not leave these on when music is not playing because in the middle of the night you will surely be jarred out of bed by loud popping sounds.I would not recommend this product.
3,Husband doesn't care for it,I bought this as a father's day gift for my husband after reading the great reviews. He's an avid golfer so I thought he'd love it. I don't think he's even played with it once! It doesn't come with clubs so I let some kids use my real putter and that was a mistake as it caused divots in the cement deck. :(Pretty disappointed seeing it wasn't that cheap.
3,Island Golf,"This toy arrives without golf clubs, so it will be necessary to provide either toy clubs or adult clubs in order to use this product."
5,So Beautiful Songs,"Songs from Gilberto are so beautiful. I admire his hum and Bossa Nova rhythm. It is harmony,relaxing and inspiring. The concert atmosphere makes the songs more powerful and expecting. I wish I were in that concert."
2,Bob deserves better treatment... are you listening Sony?,"This Brazilian import is a retitled but direct copy of the out-of-print Bob Dylan video ""Hard To Handle,"" a document of his 1986 Australian tour backed by Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers. Unfortunately there is very little Bob on official DVD, so the less than stellar video and audio on this release is very disappointing. Hopefully a better version will be released by Sony/Columbia. In the meantime if you have the VHS version it's better than this. If you don't have the VHS, than you should get this at least for the performance."
1,a bootleg,"another bootleg dvd, all this material is being traded among fans for free and often in better quality."
2,Buy Something Else,"I bought this book primarily for the CD, which could have been a lot better. The program cycled through test questions that I had already answered, and I only took a few tests. Also, it seems to only have one version of each type of essay.If I were just judging the book, I would give it 1 star. The actual text is awful. The questions are horribly constructed. Many of the analogies do not even contain words that are the same part of speech (ETS would never do that), and the reading comprehension questions mostly asked for factual information.Barron's has a much better prep for the GRE and ETS's free CAT practice test is a much better way to practice computer test-taking.Wow...I really can't believe how bad this book is. I feel like I wasted a lot of time with it."
5,So just Enjoy and celebrate...,"The fact that Ms. J is the sh__. OH MY GOD!!!, I have been waiting for this album to drop for a long time now, and now it is my hands and in my collection. I love it love it, and love her so much. Say what you want, believe what you want about Janet, that woman is awesome. This album is awesome. There isn't much I can say but please please please please go get this album. If you don't, you have serious issues that needs some serious fixin'. So just ENJOY and celebrate..."
4,20YO 4/5 Stars,"Janet Jackson has been through a lot in the past 20 years and now she is coming out with an album of joy. 20YO is a great album, not the best....but noting compared to the last two albums..AFY & DamitaJo. Songs like Enjoy, Daybreak, and With You brings me back to the ""Janet"" 1993 ages..while Show Me, Get It out me, & Do it to me are winners in my book."
4,Best Janet album since Control!!!,"My girl is back, and in a big way! She's happy, in love and sounding great. I have always admired Janet, she's always been an icon in my book, and this albums just proves that nothing has changed. I absolutely LOVE this album. It's classic Janet! My favorite songs are: Call On Me, With U, Daybreak, and Take Care. Welcome back, Janet. I love you, girl!"
2,This is a very weak album,"The only track that I really liked was ""Take Care."" Everything else justseemed dumbed down and lacking of Janet's individuality. ""Damita Jo"" wasso underrated. The good news is that 20.Y.O is selling well and hopefullynext time she'll do better. Like many other reviewers, I'm bored withthe sexed up stuff too. She needs to make a creative statement like shedid with ""The Velvet Rope"" to get me to buy anything she does again"
2,A mixed Bag as well...,"I didn't know she even came out with this cd, I remember when Call on Me came out and your heard about it for a week and then it pretty much disappeared! At first I was really surprised how strong and great the the album was. I used to play it on my ipod all the time, but then it eventually wore off and got really lackluster. To me this is better then her previous album,but it's still not that great. I thought some her song choices sucked... Call on me was ok... Do it to me was really execellent(hot beats!).Get it Out me was pretty good as well. There's some crappy material and some good material. It's a mixed bag overall. If you like Neyo or rihanna's latest cd's then this def. the album for you to get. I would recommend this to any pop music fan or r & b you can get your use out of it!"
4,20 Y.O. a failed successful project,"I too was one of those who passed on this album thinking it was going to be mediocre. I too have given up on Janet at the time this album was released. But thankfully Discipline regained my faith in her to a degree. So I decided to put my money down and buy 20 Y.O.No regrets here! I'd dare to say that it's tighter than Damita Jo!On 20 Y.O. I could listen the first half without any hesitation. Ms Janet wants to have fun and bring back the nostalgia of the 80's. And why the hell not?! The beats and sounds are all good. The songs DO NOT fail to please! People definitely overlooked this one in my opinion and that's unfortunate for Janet.Perhaps it was a bad choice to choose Call on me as the kick off single because honestly it's not the best track on the album. By the time So Excited came around, it was already a bit too late to salvage 20 Y.O.It could've been grand!It was all a miscalculation-the promotion, the interest, etc...But 20 Y.O. will stand the test of time!"
4,Enjoyable listen,"20 YO is much better than her previous 2 cd's IMO. The production of the album is great allowing each song to flow well into the next song. Tracks such as ""Enjoy"", ""Daybreak"", ""With U"", and ""Take Care"" have that pure classic vibe fans expect from Janet. She fully delivers on these tracks and others. ""Get it out me"" and ""Do it to me"" have interesting arrangements and beats, which makes these tracks HOT. What prevents me from giving her a 5 star review is the deletion of the bonus track ""Roll witchu"". This track has Janet written all over it and should have been placed before ""Take Care"" on the cd. To previous reviewers who said she can't sing, Janet is an entertainer first and foremost. I enjoy how Janet expresses herself through her voice. Her voice made songs like ""Let's wait awhile"" and ""I get lonely"" classics."
3,Disappointed,"After reading reviews here I went ahead and bought this album, but am sorely disappointed. I agree with the last reviewer who said this is not classic Janet, and that she's gone in another direction. No songs reach out and grab me."
2,Buy a used copy of this cd! It's obvious that she's more concerned with her image!,"I've always been a Janet Jackson fan and would never see myself writing a bad review about her music. But I've been sadly disappointed with ""Damita Jo"" and now ""20 Y.O"" as well. The first two singles were lame and the entire album is just tired. The production quality is the most impressive attribute on this album. They're no solid singles that you've always expected from Janet Jackson. ""All For You"" started the trend of her releasing shallow albums, heavily explicit and sexual. I'd forgiven her for the XXX ""Damita Jo"" and new that she would redeem herself. Madonna did it with ""Confession On A Dance Floor"" after that awful ""American Life"" album. But Janet has failed to deliver to us something memorable, groundbreaking or worthy of our time. If you don't it, purchase ""Velvet Rope."" It is by far her best work to date. And what's up with that tired bootleg album cover that was designed by a fan?"
1,I really don't believe in Janet anymore.,"Janet used to be an icon, now she's just like every other singer who releases horrible music only purchased by her undying fans who'll purchase absolute garbage just so they can say they are the ""true"" fans. This CD is levels below her previous work and even levels below the catostrophic Damita Jo release. Janet began getting old and tired when she released All For You and all her creativity and talent just seemed to fly right out the window. This is the rock bottom for her and it shows. Every song on here sounds like filler, and those annoying, disruptive interludes are still present. This was supposed to be a return to form for her, but it's obvious that was just said to hype the record. I'm no longer looking forward to anymore releases from this washed-up ""artist"", I've lost faith in her."
1,Am I all alone?,"Am i the only real music lover left on this planet that thinks, no knows, that Janet CANNOT sing. Don't get me wrong, very nice body, nice dancing, but her voice is garbage. For that matter none of the Jacksons can sing, stop playing, keep it real."
2,ALRIGHT,"Let me be totally honest, this album is OK at best. The 20 Y.O album is not classic janet or new and improved janet, just overproduced janet...nowhere near the level of her previous works. I would have been happier with a digitally mastered 20th anniversary re-issued Control album."
5,"JANET""S BACK!!!!!!!!!!","The more I listen to this CD the better it gets. Every week I have a different fav track. First it was the DO IT TO ME, then GET IT OUT OF ME. Right now its DAYBREAK. Other stand out tracks are:WITH ULOVE 2 LOVEENJOYSHOW ME"
3,Lame title for a pretty good Janet Jackson cd.,"Janet Jackson's classic and best cds are Velvet Rope and Janet, sure her other cds had hit songs too but those two cds,I think, are her very best.Damita Jo was only disappointing because it had such few dance tracks. The first half of 20 YO is great and then after that the music quality gets worse and worse. Fans of Janet Jackson want music that they can get their groove on to, they do not want slow lovely dovey ballads that will soothe you into a deep sleep. Are there some classic dance cuts on here? Yes there are about three or four. Are there some lame and dull tracks on here? Yes, most of the cd is sort of dull and trite, after the first half. Also the title 20 YO is really lame. It should have been called Janet Unveiled or something sensual like that."
3,"Doesn't quite recapture the magic of 1986-1993, but still a marked improvement over All For You and Damita Jo","When I bought Janet's latest album, I was desperately hoping that it would be a better listen than her last two albums. Well, I can't say that it's marvelous, but I can say that it's definitely better than her 2001 & 2004 albums; at least as good as The Velvet Rope. ""Take Care"" is a smooth, sensuous slow jam that might have sounded better on Control, Rhythm Nation, or Janet, but at least it, along with plausible cuts like ""Enjoy"" and ""Daybreak"", makes for her best in almost a decade."
3,Her voice is such a whisper!,"Her voice had me straining to figure out what she was saying. The CD is entertaining and I don't hate any of the songs.Intro - She says she's going to keep it light => This is an album about nothing in particular.After her intro, Jermaine Dupri says 'What you talking bout shorty?' - unnecessary. He didn't need to speak on the CD just because he is producing it. That line was out of place.So excited - I like this one. Hot songSo excited flows straight into Show me - this song sounds a lot like So excited and it's also hot.`Show me' flows into `Get it out me' which sounds like `So excited' and `Show me'.`Show me' is hot too.`Do it 2 me' sounds like the remix of `I get so lonely' from one of her previous albums but it's hot.`This body' - A horny track. It's ok`With u' - slowish sweet jam.`Call on me' featuring Nelly - good one. I like. It grew on me due to radio play.`Enjoy' is a positive, uplifting song.`Take care' and `Love 2 love' are for love making."
3,3.5 stars,"Janet combines the old melodies of Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis with the new clap beats of Jermaine Dupri. The results are mixed. Some of these songs could have been left behind, including the interludes, but most of it is pretty good. Janet's vocals leave a lot to be desired and JD's same old beats get very tiresome by the halfway mark. I also don't like how the fast and slow songs are so segregated. It makes the album seem very long and a task to listen to. The upbeat tracks feel very forced and gimmicky. The ballads are nice, but not all of them have replay value. To me, ""Do It 2 Me"" is the only really stellar song on here. Overall, this is a mixed bag. It's pretty good but I wouldn't recommend buying it for any more than the $10 Amazon offers. The deluxe edition is very nice, though."
1,20 years old? have you learned nothing?,"This is album is was total disappointment. It was supposed to be a 20 year tribute to Control. If only even one song on the album could even hold a torch to Nasty it would be something. Come on Janet...give us what we want!Janet is at best her in the pop genre with a hint of R&B; flavor. On this album she just misses the groove. It's no wonder this album has one of her worst selling first week sales. Even though Damita Jo floundered under the backlash from the Super Bowl flashing inicident, it was a much better album overall and closer in every respect to classic Janet.We love you Janet, but we don't want grooves with no hook or catchy chorus. Stick to what you do best. Maybe it's time to keep Germaine Dupree in the bedroom, but out of your career. Here's hoping you still have a career at 25 yrs old!"
5,JANET GOES ELECTRO-TRIP-HOP R&B on 20 Y.O. !!!!!!!!!,"If you thought Run DMC had some wicked beats & sounds on there earlyer stuff...then JANET'S new album ""20 Years Old"" takes you on a very similar funky-fresh dance zippy hippy dippin' yo-thang type of vibe ! Does that make any sense ?...nor does twenty years of being in the music bussiness according Janet's new album!One might get confused as to which cd artwork to choose from...I counted 5 different versions released in the USA today (9-26-2006). The music is a clever blend of crisp,cool sounding futuristic bleeps and Zaaaps; mixed with Janet's mellow sultry purrs & hyms..I mean like real hyms as in praiseing the lord like on my favorite track ""enjoy""!"
2,Disappointment,"It's rare that an establised artist gains new fans. Which would probably explain the lack of air play. 15 year olds just aren't listening to artists from the 80's and 90's. With this in mind it's puzzling that Janet would release 2 albums back to back with the same type of R&B / Hip-Hop material. Yes it's popular but your fan base isn't listening to this type of music. Madonna has figured this out, it's a shame Janet hasn't. Follow your fan base. Most of us dedicated fans still listen to the old material, dance, pop. Despite what Janet says this is not a dance album. I don't know of any club that is playing this material. It's not that it's a bad album. It's just doesn't have any stand out singles. Each song blends into the next with no change in tempo. It's just not catchy or exciting. Still it is significantly better than Damita Jo."
4,Grows on you and is enjoyable,"I was a hater of this cd but re-listened to it a couple days ago. I don't know what I was thinking!In fact, I have new favorite songs now.. ""Get it Out Me"" and ""Daybreak"" are very good and the latter is beautiful because of the bells in the background.""Show Me"", ""Do it 2 Me"", ""With U"" are also nice ones.Some of the best songs are ones you love more with each listening and that's what happens with these."
1,THIS NOT A GOOD CD AT ALL!,"It's horribe! It's a total studio album..synthesizers and drum machines and constant ""clapping"" machines in the back ground that run the entire length of the song..but not only that but WHEN are we going to be able to UNDERSTAND what Janet is even singing? You can NEVER NEVER NEVER understand what the words to the songs are? I get so sick of it! I like to sing along to the music!!!! I don't think she's really singing anything actually!! All the songs sound the same..they run into each other..in fact I thought it was still on the same song until I looked at my CD player and saw that I was already up to song # 4 !!! and it sounded like all the others before it!And as usual she likes to blab once in while in between songs(it's the only way you actually know that a song has ended and another one is going to begin.hahahaha...)..I'm really sick of her..I think she should just move away like her brother!ugh."
1,Janet @ 20,I did not enjoy this cd. I tried to give it away free in a fundraiser and nobody claimed it nor was it any help in getting donations.
3,Should have done better,"This album was a pretty good album (a whole lot better than her previous album, the terrible Damita Jo). I think the reason it didn't do well is because of the poor single choices. Call on Me is plain and boring and never should have been used as a lead single. So Excited would have been a better first choice, but by the time it was released as the second single, people had already lost interest. This Body, Show Me and Get It Out Me would have been great single choices, but instead Virgin Records decided to release the boring Enjoy and With U as singles. Another thing that doesn't make sense is that there is a really good song on the Japanese version called Roll Wit Chu, but is not included on the American version. This is a much better song that some of the other songs that did make the final cut, so I don't know why it wasn't included.The album is certainly no Control, Rhythm Nation, or Velvet Rope, but it is a decent album."
3,okay effort on 20 Y.O,"It hurts not to have better things to say about a talented artist like JANET, but she could have done better. The album only has 11 songs, out of the 11 my fav's are:Show MeGet it out meThis bodyCall on meEnjoyTake CareSadly the interlude are a waste of time & she should have include her remake of ""weekend""; along with more dance songs. In the end, it's an okay album."
1,NOT A CLASSIC,"When i first heard the single with Nelly i was amped bout gett'n the CD. After i actually purchased it, it literally has been in my CD player only twice. Once when i first bought it to skim thru it and the second was because my sister was in my car and wanted to hear it. The moment i got back in the driver's side it came out. The only reason why i bought it was because JERMAINE produced it. And I am truley a fan. He doesnt get the credit he deserves for his talent. But this time i can honestly say this was not his best. I was so disappointed in him. Im not sure if this was rushed, but this is NOT HER BEST..........."
3,A JJ fan here...BUT,"This CD is not creative and innovative enough for my tastes. I really had high hopes for this one but I feel that it has fallen way short. I am not surprised that the sales are much weaker than expected. It's the same ole same ole stuff; The beats aren't even that great! Bring us something different next time, Janet! Love ya, anyway!"
1,Coming Soon To A Used CD Shop Near You,"I find it inspiring how Janet got back in shape and finally met someone who loves her deeply. Too bad it doesn't show through her music. I thought ""20. Y. O"" was a real snooze. The majority of the songs are forgetable and could've been performed by anybody. The only two songs I liked were ""Enjoy"" and ""Take Care"". Janet has never been known as a strong vocalist and she makes herself sound bad on a few songs with the breathy sing-song talking that Cassie does. I just wasn't impressed with this CD. It's Janet just trying to be as hip as possible, not much of the younger Janet on ""Control"" shining through at all. I agree with another reviewer who stated ""Control"" should've been remastered, that and the addition of just a few new songs. Don't rush to buy this."
1,Horrible,"This a horrible CD. The songs are devoid of any melody. Not one single track has a good hook or stays with you. It's one big yawn. Once again the lyrical content is mostly about how sexy she thinks she is and how bad she wants to get....well, you know what she wants, she's been singing about it like a broken record for the last decade. The CD sounds like outtakes from ""All for You"" or ""Damita Jo"". Those were not very good albums and these songs aren't even good enough for them. If you like today's R & B (which has neither R(rhythm) nor B(blues)) then this kind of posturing posing as music might appeal to you. But, if you like your music to be tinged with real soul and real passion then avoid this mess all together."
2,Dissapointed,"I am an avid Janet Jackson fan. Love her work ever since CONTROL came out. But I am rather disappointed in her latest effort. Not one song is likeable. What was going through her mind when she chose these songs for her album? I think its time for her to either take a break or enlist new producers and songwriters. Don't get me wrong - I still follow her work and admire her for performing so hard, but lately her last 2 albums (including Damita Jo) were not on the level as her previous ones. She's always been on top and to me she is still one of the best performers out there."
3,Still my girl!,"Overall the music has wonderful beats great for dancing. But, I hope that Ms. Janet moves beyond her sex-crazed phase. It is time to get the girl back who could croon about the sexy as well as deal with issues of life, love and subject of substance. Still love her though."
3,good but not great,"The jimmy jam & terry lewis tracks minus jermaine dupri are winners: Daybreak, Enjoy, Take Care and Love 2 Love. The ones with Jermaine Dupri aren't bad but they aren't great either. Jermaine is a brilliant producer with other artists but with janet, there is just something that is totally off. I liked those songs when I first heard them but now they're just annoying and stale throwaway r&b. Call On Me was NEVER a great song to begin with, it was written by nelly & jermaine and sampled an older song written by jimmy & terry by SOS Band, but it doesn't work. Obviously janet gave all her work to jermaine to do and trusted him too much: BIG MISTAKE!"
2,"Album is okay, definitely NOT great","After hearing the song 'Take Care' I ran out to buy 20 Y.O. I discovered however that this album is not very good at all. A lot of the songs seem repetitive. Too many dance tunes with no substenance. I found the album to be pretty boring. There are a few good tracks, at most four. Take care is the only good love song on the album in my opinion."
1,"Very weak - Janet, time to retire","Janet, please retire. Now. You have an amazing musical legacy that will last forever - please don't sully it with more boring releases like this one. I have always loved Janet's music and I hate to say it, but whereas once she was an innovator and looked ahead, she has now been left behind. There is nothing on this album that you haven't heard elsewhere and done better. Sad. I really was hoping for something that would dazzle my ears. Instead, this album sounds like just a monotone voice in the crowd."
1,What?,"I used to be a fan of Janets a long time ago. I really thought this would be a cd that I could purchase and be proud to own because I haven't purchsed anything by her in a long time. I can't believe this mess!! What in the world are they thinking? ""So Excited"" is great, but only because of the girl rapping. I can't believe CALL ON ME was #1 on the R&B charts. Where is Rene Elezondo? He really helped Janet produce some really good music. Stop blaming Jermaine for this terrible disc!! This cd is just a hot mess!!"
4,Keeping Up With The Jones's ????,"...But she's A Jackson.. Janet stay's her lane with this disc. She keeps it light, sexy and fun, no one does it better. However she does evolve giving us more R&b; an a taste of ghetto flava like "" get it out me"". jazzy vibe in ""take care""Stand out track's""with you""""do it to me""""show me""""love2love"""
4,Nice Job JDJ!!!,"I'm really liking this Janet Y.O. CD. I am not the typical Janet fan. I've probably purchased about 3 of her other CD's, but I have to say this is very good. She wrote every song on the CD, along with help from JD, Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis. She's forty and can still kick the hell of the youngsters. Check her out on youtube.com when she appeared on Oprah. I like about 8 out of the 12 tracks on the CD and I think that is a pretty good ratio. I only liked 4 out 10 on Beyonce's CD. Check out So Excited-JD influenced and I really like this one, Take Care-classic Janet, Show Me-defintely JD influenced, Love 2 Love, Daybreak-classic Janet and This Body-different but I like it. Definitely a far better production than Beyonce's release, however not as good as Letoya's. Overall, nice job JDJ!!!"
5,Smiling From Ear To Ear,"Janet, Terry Lewis, Jimmy Jam and Jermaine Dupri have created another absolute gem for Miss Jackson.Everything you want and expect of Janet you get and a lot more.The interludes are as beautiful and are as special as each song.Each one gives you an idea of what to expect of the next single.I smiled, laughed and eventually cried after listening to this album.The first interlude had me laughing.The songs had me smiling and at the end I cried because I was amazed that Janet was able to do it yet again.The song Enjoy will have you addicted.Once you play it you will put it on repeat.It is the one song everyone seems to agree is the heart and soul of this cd.20 Y.O is fresh and funky and unlike anything Janet has ever done and yet it's just what you expect of her.I love this album... just love it."
1,We were waiting for THIS?!?!,"I love ya, Janet...but I've gotta tell you...I'm bitterly disappointed. We love you for making us want to dance, with a few songs thrown in the mix for us to chill out and relax to. But, this time you've given us something that has old, tired-sounding rhythms, re-hashes, and unimaginative lyrics without the ""energy"" and ""vibe"" that you are known for. I hate to tell you, but I'd go back to the drawing board (soon), and if Jam & Lewis can't help come up with something better than this, I'd seriously reconsider their collaberation on the next album..."
3,Just Okay for Me.......,"First off Janet has been in the music business since 1982. She had two albums prior to ""Control"" So, she has been in the music business nearing 25 years. Anyway, like many of you though, I became a fan in 1986 when ""Control"" was released. I now own all of her albums including the two prior to ""Control"" those are ""Janet Jackson"" and ""Dream Street"". Why I gave this album 3 stars is just like the title of my review, it is just okay for me. The songs aren't bad, but like many other reviewers have mentioned, the songs just really don't grab your attention. There is nothing new here lyrically or vocally. Some of the songs are too nasally for me or to breathy. I will listen to this album, but it will not be on heavy rotation like some of her other works. If Janet was hoping to give another boost to her career, I am afraid this album will not do the trick. Still a fan Janet, but better luck next time."
1,awful,I feel like Janet hasn't released anything good since Janet. What year was that? 1995 maybe? Wow eleven years ago. She should retire.
1,Time for Janet to RETIRE,"After first listen, you can immediately tell that this album was a producer's playground with the added element of janet's vocals, which sound like they've been auto-tuned to death."
2,Barley Listenable,"I have tried to listen to this CD a few times since I got it and not once have I heard a song that has caught my attention i find it to be more unnoticable background music anything else. Not worth the time to ""really listen"" more than once if you can handle it."
1,if she weren't Miss Janet she would get 3 stars,"This is very dispiriting to write. I so wanted to like this release, however no matter how you spin it - the record is boring. To think that this is the team that created ""janet."" - her amazing collection of songs with ""That's The Way Love Goes"" - is confounding. There is nothing to this collection. Paris Hilton's release is honestly more catchy - and that's a sad day! Jackson sums it up in the opening interlude ""20 Y.O."" - she says ""...I know, I don't know, that's what I do know"" = well sister, that is very obvious. And like another reviewer said - keep Dupree in the bedroom and out of the studio! I know Miss Janet has some more good work in her - this just isn't it. The mistake began with the title ""concept"", that was a red flag. Back to the studio Janet! We love you!"
4,With U is fiyah,"there is a track, With U, on the album and it is one of janet's best in a long time. There are pianos and snaps in it and remind me of mariah's we belong together and shake it off put together, but even smoother and sexier and it just oozes out naturally from janet. Check out this track at least if not the rest of the album."
3,It's Okay!!!,"I'm a major JJ fan and I buy her CD's no matter what the critics say; but I have to say that I'm not feeling 20 Y.O. that much, nothing is catching my attention, just not a good CD to me. None of the funky, crazy beats; she has the sensual music, just sounds a little too soft to me, not the Janet I'm used to!! I will listen to the CD again and hopefully I'll get more out of it, but no matter what, she is Janet Jackson and I will ALWAYS support her!!!"
2,Wanted more....,"I really wanted to like this album. To me it seems like she has no passion at all in her current songs. The songs while alright really show her thin voice...i couldnt help but think how much better they would have been if it had been Mariah singing. Even the music itself seems a little less intricate than her previous works, thats my opinion..hope she listens to those who arent quite satisfied."
3,"What happened, Janet?","In the past I have loved everything she has ever done...until now. I thought that this would be the similar kind of tasteful songs Ms. Jackson is known for...it was not. This CD sucked! Better luck when you do your 40 Y.O., Janet!"
5,Great Comeback!,"Despite what others may say about this album, it is a great comeback from All For You and Damita Jo. I really love the freshness that she brings on this CD. The entire CD makes you happy to be alive and in love (if you are). My favorite tracks are With You, Do It 2 Me, Take Care and Enjoy. I am still a bigger fan of Rhythm Nation, Control, and The Velvet Rpe, but I love this CD also and it gets 5 stars from me for originality and the fresh vibe it brings"
4,PRETTY GOOD BALLER,"COOKIE MONEY IS VERY GOOD, P STILL BALLIN BUT IS LARGELY IGNORED BY A LOT OF RAP FANS.A LOT OF OLD FANS OF MASTER P DO NOT LIKE THE NEW STUFF.PERSONALLY I AM DOWN WITH GUTTER MUSIC TO THE END.MY COUSIN PERRY SAYS HE IS STILL THE MASTER"
2,Master Percy,"I've never seen a rapper fall this hard. Master P is a candidate for worse rapper alive his beats garbage he spit that sewer water over every track. Maybe Im bias cause I'm a old fan but go get Ghetto D or Ice Cream Man , Ghetto Postage or somethin cause P been trippin since 2000."
2,Dissapointing!!,"Great man but bad biografy! The writer simply looses the focus on the amount of information he gives. I only read the first chapter and the other two devoted to the opera House, Sadly. I expected much more from this biografy."
1,OUCH,This product hurt my hands so bad that I had to cut the plastic off in some places. It is good protection but it is wasted if your fingers hurt to much to pull the trigger
3,a not so punctual text,"In the choice of the sources, it doesn't follow the historical mainstream; so it can fall in some mistake. For example, under the lemma ""FINZI, Aldo"" you can find that Herbert Kappler was ""the German police chief in Rome who was later helped by Roman Catholic priests to escape in 1977 from the island of Gaeta"". Actually, Kappler escaped from the Celio military hospital, in Rome, and it's the first time I hear about a plot involving priests in his flight (neither this circumstance has ever appeared in the criminal inquiry). Above all, every traveller on the Tyrrenean sea can give evidence about the absence of an island in front of Gaeta, whose military jail is strongly anchored to the land..."
3,Not his best work...,"Really, Otto Von Schirach is an excellent entertainer, but this album seems to lack his fullness on every track. You get the feeling that he went for bizarre over quality. While this album is totally fun, it's lacking in fine tuning. Seeing as Maxipad Detention was flawless, this album could use the same fine toothed inspection. Keep the gold and drop some of the filler. At some points it seems some of the glitchier tracks were just mashing buttons. The points when he really focuses and takes things in unexpected directions make this album truly worth my money."
4,Good album,This album is pretty good for these boys to be so young(14-17 years old)They have so good tracks on the album a lot better than I thought. C-Los is definitly doing his thang so is Romeo he's definitly growing up and u can tell.
3,An okay start,"It's okay.It has pretty good production and is definitly better than Lil romeo's solo albums.I guess he not such A bad rapper anymore.C-los,youngV and the other rappers are pretty good as well.I'll give this 3 and a half stars.This album may not have been all that,but i'm kina looking foward to seeing what else they have in store."
1,Romeo ruins the album,"Seriously... why do rich boyz let romeo in this album? without romeo i woulda given it 5 stars! Romeo is the worst rapper to hav ever lived. Simple version? Romeo suks, end of story."
1,why is no limit stuill trying,"p must not have anything better to do cept maker trashy cd's with nothing but bs tracks now lil romeo got a group of young kn uckelheads thinking they can make some money in this rap game you gotta be stupid for signing with no limit retarded if they think they can move units with this p, romeo nobody cares about ya'll anymore."
5,Does the Job!,Works great! I like that it senses vibrations from your dog rather than sound - His old collar would shock him when his sister would bark - no fair.
1,"Poorly constructed, Not good with large breeds","I purchased two of these collars. I have a couple of labradors each about a yr old, the collar stopped them from barking right away, however they were curious about the others collar and easily popped the top casing off of these with one bite. When I returned from a 15 min. trip to the store I found both devices were in pieces.What a waste of money............ I have an older rechargable collar from Inotek that was bulkier but very sturdy have used it for over 3 yrs wish I could find another one of those."
1,Dog Will Bark,"I am on my second Innotek automatic rechargeable No-bark collar. The first didn't appear to work at all so the company graciously provided a second one. What I didn't know is that the collar actually makes your dog bark. As soon as I put in on my dachshund, unit fully charged, locked and loaded, he barks like crazy...all day. The neighbors love it. I leave for work with the sound of his barking in my ears and come home, greeted by my pet's vociferous greeting. If you love barking dogs, buy this collar!It works!And it's rechargeable!Innotek Automatic No-Bark Dog Collar, BC-50B"
1,Cheated,"The seller charged me full price and sent a cheaper collar. I specifically wanted the rechargeable batteries and I was sent ""replaceable battery"", a cheaper and undesirable version."
3,Just so-so,"I purchased two of these collars, one for each of my dogs. What drew me was the rechargeable battery and the ""learning"" function. The only problem is, after just a couple of weeks, the batteries didn't hold much of a charge. Since the collar resets itself every time you charge it, by the time the strength would work itself up to the level my dogs required, the batteries would already be dead again. It is an endless cycle."
2,Only two worked out of the three,"I bought three collars as all the dog will bark and start the other two barking.Two of the collars work fine but one dose not. I thought it may be to loose but it wasn't, when I checked it.That's why I gave it a TWO. Other wise they are good."
2,DISAPPOINTED,"I've tried a different collar before but couldn't find it. This collar did NOT do the trick. My dog barked anyway and it actually caused burn marks on his neck. So... rather than deter him from barking, it buzzed but not enough to cease the bark rather it caused trauma. I do not recommend this collar. I've actually considered contacting the manufacturer to inform them of the issue. I had to take my black lab to the vet as a result of this collar."
3,Also not sure its working,"After reading all the positive reviews on the internet, I bought this bark collar for my 15 pound chi mix. I charged the battery as directed and tested the collar as the packaging suggests. The test showed that the collar is working; however, my husband came home to hearing the dog bark one afternoon, even though he was wearing the collar. We were curious so we held the collar to our own necks and tried barking. Nothing happened. However, we put the collar on the dog when we are home and he won't bark when the doorbell rings, which is a big deal! So all in all, it may be working sporadically or it may not be working; it is hard to tell."
4,very readable,"This is a good, easy read, enjoyable and a nicely produced book which I happily recommend to you.A couple of quibbles with the translation however:A few passages are translated into American slang, no doubt a rendition of street talk of the time. Unfortunately not only is it culture specific, it is clumsy and outdated, particularly so for non-American readers.The other quibble - sexuality and body functions are translated with prudish mild euphemisms. I don't know what the original latin is like, but I would be most surprised if it was rendered with such timid side-stepping.I suspect that sexually explicit parts of Petronius were edited out during the middle ages, long before it reached us, and that this translation perpetuates the delicacy of Christian cultures."
4,Drunken Stanley,"This is one of the best Laurel & Hardy features i've seen. I haven't seen them all but i've seen most of them and so far only ""Way Out West"" and maye ""Sons Of The Desert"" are better then this one. It's definitly one of the top 5 movies they made. Incredibly funny with an amusing story behind it. Some needless musical numbers but overall a fantastic film. Apparently there is another story behind this film...actress Thelma Todd's last film as she died later in the year from ""accidental carbon minoxide poisoining""...and apparently because of that was left out of a big chunk of the movie. Neverthess...a fantastic movie and keep an eye out for possibly the funniest scene in Laurel & Hardy cinema history when Stanley gets himself drunk trying to fill beer bottles!"
2,Disappointing L&H Comic Opera,"Though ""Swiss Miss"" was among Laurel and Hardy's weaker features, it contained several vintage sequences. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said about ""The Bohemian Girl"" (1936) - a dour comic opera with few highlights. What worked so beautifully in ""Fra Diavolo"" falls flat this time around. The Stan and Ollie characters remain submerged in the operetta's unrelenting heaviness. After her mysterious death, Thelma Todd's final screen role was severely truncated in post-production, which didn't help matters."
5,Loved it.,It is really great and works fantastically. I was really worried that it wouldn't be what I needed but it turned out great.
2,Very Weak,"This projector must be used in an absolutely dark room to be effective at all. The projection is very weak and the area that it can cover from an original is very small. I had to keep moving my original around and trying to get it lined up against what I had already traced on the wall. It is inexpensive and you get what you pay for. If you only need it occasionally for small items, it is okay. If you plan to use it a lot or do any kind of large project, it will be frustrating."
3,sort of cheap,While it does what it is supposed to ~ the quality just isnt there. And it gets HOT! Not something children should use - unsupervised.
3,pricey,"product dooes what it is intended to do but..... its pricey and made cheaply. but it did what i bought it for, just think it was too pricey, but thanks to Amazon, i did get the price i could"
4,Good for the price,"This projector is a good product for the price. It takes some fiddling to get everything to line up, but it has been helpful to me in setting up proportions in my paintings. I don't use this to plot out a full picture, but just to get the proportions right and to get an outline on the canvas to work from."
4,This really is amazing!,I am a stay at home mom working on a mural for my boys. This projector is so cool. It was just what I needed. My only complaint is that the light isn't as bright as I would like. As long as the room is completely pitch black you won't have an issue. I think you can replace the light bulb with a brighter one I just haven't tried it yet.
1,trace projector,Listen to the first reviewer. This thing gets ridiculously hot because it lacks a fan. It does work in a very dark room and the image projected was fine. But after 15 minutes the tracer was overheated and almost too hot to touch. The paper image I placed underneath was also very hot to the touch. I just bought it and returned it.
1,totally useless,"I bought this projector for an art project and returned it the next day.It's so weak that after turning off all lights, including darkening the screen of my computer did I see a vague image! It's a joke and please don't waste your money on this. I'm still looking for a better one, even if it means to pay more."
1,not worth the money,"I have used this projector for several years, and there are a few things wrong with it:1- it overheats and the photo you place underneath will get warped, especially if you are tracing a face2- the size of the opening is smaller than a 4x6 photo, so I have to move the tracer to get the other end of my picture, which is a serious pain3- if you touch it, the whole thing is off and you have to fix it in the middle of your tracing.the negative reviews are true. Don't buy this one, buy a different projector. It's not worth the money."
1,Not Useful for Projection!,"I was so excited to rcv this as a Christmas gift to assist in some mural work. It was the biggest disappointment. If you have a coloring book image with bold black lines and you are in a DARK room... not a dark room, but a room used for photographic development, with absolutely NO light, you can see a blurry image. But totally useless for projecting under normal circumstances."
3,"Not the greatest, but works fine for beginners.","I bought this because I needed a quick way to enlarge several drawings to start some paintings. I've never really used projectors like this one before, but I found that it worked fine. The image is fairly clear, but the room does need to be very dark.The projector does have the tendency to get hot, so I would suggest not using originals if there is the worry of damage. However, I didn't experience any overheating. As someone who is starting out with the use of projectors this worked fine.The only aspect of it that was frustrating was that there is no way to hold the original in place steadily. At times the paper would slip and I would have to spend five minutes readjusting everything.Works best for small or simple projects, if you're looking for something more versatile I would suggest something different."
4,Been using it for years!,"I really like this stuff. We use cast iron for everything other than pots. This seasons the cast iron better than PAM and goes a long way. Still doesn't replace proper cleaning and care, but if used right it makes cleaning your cast irons pans a breeze."
3,Don't squeeze too hard!,"This gift was intended for the chef in the family. Not the strongest man in the world, it was difficult for the conditioner to come out. After a mediocre squeeze, the tube exploded all over the counter...and the chef. Just a faulty tube. Perhaps. But I would suggest another brand because it was an awkward moment at Christmas breakfast."
4,This is pretty good,"It works better than Crisco or the other oils I tried.Don't try to cook tomatillos in a cast iron skillet. It ruined the seasoning--the gray cast iron color was showing through and when I was it, more of the old seasoning came off in flakes. I tried to re-season it using other oils, including crisco, and used various methods such as heating it very hot in the oven for a long period of time or just heating it on the stove top after applying oil/shortening. Nothing really worked to re-season the it--the black color just wasn't happening and food stuck to it. I bought this and after the first coating, I saw that the gray cast iron was looking noticeably darker. I've used it 3 times now and the skillet gets darker every time plus the food seems to stick less each time I use the skillet after I use the conditioner."
4,Overheated olive oil creates carcinogens; warm this conditioner in microwave to get it out of the tube,"From Sur La Table: ""Once olive oil starts smoking, most of the healthy benefits that people use olive oil for dissipate, and in fact it starts releasing carcinogens.""It starts occurring at its smoke point, which is around 400 degrees - the temperature you're supposed to have the oven to season cast iron. So if you're using cooking oil, do a Google search and pick one with a higher smoke point, like grapeseed oil (485 degrees) and others.As for getting Cast Iron Conditioner out of the tube, just zap it in the microwave for 10 second spurts at a time until the conditioner squeezes out easily. Check it after each 10 second interval - get it too hot and it'll melt the tube. And that will happen *fast* soon after the conditioner reaches a certain temperature."
5,Great conditioner for cast iron,I was looking for an easy way to keep my iron skillet conditioned as we have several cooks in the house and many people use it. I ask each one to simply clean the skillet and leave on top of the stove so I can condition it before putting it away. It is always ready for use and works as well as seasoning it in the oven!
3,cast-iron conditioner,"Works well, however QC is lacking. Of 3 tubes that I have bought, each has had a different consistency: from thin as veggie oil to too thick to squeeze out without softening in hot water for ~5 minutes.I ended up consolidating and blending the tubes then reloading with a basting needle, since my smallest spice funnel won't fit the tube. Made quite a mess."
5,"Monday In London's ""The Red Machine""","This CD is full of catchy beats and great lyrics. The unique sound of this band is unmatchable to its peers on Indianola Records. Their talent reminds me of an earlier ""Juliana Theory"" and then at times the vocals are that of ""The Used"". It is bewildering that this talent is misplaced on a hardcore label but this CD is only their beginning. I am sure we will see much more in the future from this promising band."
3,Drummer Boy,"The drummer on this album is amazing. i've had the privilage of hearing his drum stylings on many occasions and i must say that his skills are supurb and uncanny. You will be truly blessed if your ears grace his supreme unmatched percussion sound. Drummer Boy, my hat is off to you."
5,Inuksuit,"Inuksuit: Silent Messengers of the Arctic by Norman Hallendy is a great book in three ways. It is well written, he speaks with compassion and eloquence about the culture and landscape of the far north. His photography is panoramic and beautiful. His subject matter is the mysterious stone structures found across northern Canada and Baffin Island. The title of the book, ""Inuksuit"" is an Inuit word (plural) that translates as ""...acts in the capacity of a human."" But they have many meanings as guide posts and message boards. And most mysterious of all, not all of them were made by the Inuit. They tell us that the oldest of the Inuksuit were built by an unknown race called Tunnitt.....who came and prepared the land for all of us."" A must have book for any one who is interested in the lands and peoples of the far North."
5,Three thumbs up!,"The idea of multiple worlds is not new, yet Peter Garrison employs this concept with grace. In this second book of the Changeling Saga, Garrison builds on the characters, to let the reader know what position they will take later in the book and the saga. This book begins with the introduction of a new character, Growler, a mysterious being who comes from the Third World. Back on Earth, the Petranova's wage a battle against the Pale Man, aka Mr. Smith, because Smith has taken Roman Petranova's son, Ernie. Ernie's spirit has been sent to Castle while his body stays on Earth. Mrs. Mendeck sends Brian and Joe to Castle so that Brian can learn to become a Maker and so that Joe can find his cousin, Ernie's, spirit. The heroes meet up with a minor deity named Gontor and fall in with his crowd. The story ends as Brian finally meets up with Growler to begin his training."
1,Didn't like it!,This product was dry no matter how much top coat you put on. There are much better products out there.
5,I Wish I Could Locate This Book Again!,"I first read Raquel Welch's Total Beauty and Fitness in the 6th grade...Since then I have been obsessed with Yoga. Welch is down to earth, informative, and stunning. Unfortunately, a few years ago my book was damaged. I will continue to look for the book, and in the meantime practice my Hatha Yoga daily."
4,On Becoming Teenwise,"This is a helpful book for parents who are having serious problems with their teenaged child. I was looking for a book on the more basic teen behaviors, such as talking back etc, and this book does not really get into the more basic issues."
5,Comprehensive,"This is the book that the breeders we purchased our wolfdog from recommended for us and also the book that is most recommended by wolfdog websites (as far as I can tell). I skimmed through and found some very useful information but haven't actually read it because my girlfriend was mostly through reading it first, when she left it outside on the table and....ole' Odin, the wolfdog of ours that we learning about, shredded the book to smithereens!!! Ha!!!"
5,A rare 5 star book,"I agree with those who write that the book's one serious flaw is its title, because I'm afraid only people who are considering ownership of a ""wolf dog"" or wolf hybrid will read this book. It's one of the best general dog training books, well worth considering by anyone who plans to add a canine companion to his or her family - not just ""wolfdog"", but any dog, from a Chinese crested or chihuahua to a Malinois or a mastiff.I have two reservations about the book. First, it seems to me that the predictions about how quickly a canine (any canine) will learn new behaviors are overly optimistic. Training takes time, and for almost all dogs that time is measured in weeks, months, and sometimes in years. Second, I wonder if a wolf hybrid is the right dog for a person or family who is brand new to canine ownership/leadership.But this is still a superb book for any dog owner/leader/handler, especially for the ""newcomer""."
5,An essential guide to making the year run smoothly.,"Covering every topic teachers need to focus on, from setting up the physical space of the classroom to assessment to home-school relations to teaching caring and more, this book offers advice from teachers and researchers. The many checklists and reproducibles are especially handy!"
1,save your money....this book is tripe.,"this book isn't worth the paper it's written on...it provides no insight into parenting, and it has silly/annoying cartoons throughout. it reads quickly, because there's no substance....and yet i couldn't even bear to finish it."
5,Compact Sanus Tilt Mount,it's easy to install and perfect for a medium sized flat screen tv! no problems fitting to my Toshiba!
2,A disappointment,"After programming in Visual Basic for a few years now, I was ready to port over and start learning C++. Knowing the For Dummies... books weren't all that bad for beginning programmers, I decided to try this book out. Sadly, it doesn't cover any topics on the C++ language in depth, and can sometimes be confusing in how things are explained in the book, especially overloading operators. Instead, get C++ Interactive Course by Robert Lafore. Trust me, you'll have all your questions about object oriented programming and basic C++ answered by the time you're through with the Interactive Course book."
3,Worked for me,"I bought this book because i needed a language program to do a College work. The book was cheap and i could get the software (Visual C++) then i bought the book. My work had a pretty decent grade, so i think the book is good, but in this moment is obsolet considering the new programming languages (Java, etc.)and new software."
5,Great for beginners,This book was great. It was an excellent introduction to the complicated language of C++.My only complaint would be the lack of discussion on MFC classes. All in all it is great for beginners. PICK IT UP.
3,Poor introduction to GUI apps,"Visual C++ 5.0 for dummies is an incomplete reference to say the least. For those that do not know C++, it may suffice. But as far as the actual Visual C++ enviorment, it provides VERY LITTLE instruction as far as 32-bit Windows apps are concerned. It's more of a C++ tutorial, than a Visual C++ guide.If you're looking for a guide to get you started in Windows application developement using Visual C++, save your money. If you don't know standard C++, this guide may be for you."
1,Dont waste your money.,I got this book to teach me Visual C++. It didnt. They try to make the book fun but it just destroys the information in it. I do not like this book.
4,Exceptional tea,"I've tried a LOT of green teas and most of them range from bland to truly awful, but this one (first time I've purchased it) is a rare exception.Bright green, vibrant, balanced flavor - a little bitterness, which is part of the desired profile of a green tea, but smooth and not at all ""dusty"" tasting as with so many others. I don't usually buy Harney teas but this was a great find. The only other green tea brand I think is noteworthy is YamaMotoYama, but it's not very widely distributed. My two cents: look for Sencha style green teas - IMO they are by far the best tasting."
3,Munchkin Mat,"Product that arrived is different than product pictured, but does the job just the same. I wish the mat was a little thicker."
4,Good buy for the price,"I bought this mat to go under my son's Fisher-Price Rainforest Healthy Care High Chair [ASIN:B000I5T3T6] and it has kept my carpet from getting stained. It's also very easy to clean. A little thinner than I would like it to be, and so prone to tearing; but given the price, totally worth it."
4,great book! but somthing is missing!,"This is a great book that covers allot of the forgotten conflicts in South and Central America. It covers the reasons, the contenders in the conflict, a description of the events and an analysis of the results. This is one of the best books the about Latin American conflicts I have ever read. It is invaluable to any one who is interested in out neighbor to the south. However The author seems to have forgotten to include the Panama invasion of 1989. If this was included in later printings it would be five stars. I also recommend the previous volume that covers wars before 1900."
1,Dry,"This is one of the most dry and boring textbooks I've had to read. The only textbook more boring than this one, that I can remember, was an anatomy book. I have a strong interest in psychology, so for me to find a psychology book to be boring, it must be pretty bad."
3,Development Through Life,The book was in good condition. I was hoping it would be in very good to excellent condition. The book arrived in perfect time.
5,Outstanding contemporary classic,"The same recording as appeared in the original boxed debut recording back in the 1980s, packaged in a twin-tray jewel case with few frills and a cheaper price. Very beautiful, moving minimalist opera and beautifully produced and recorded."
2,not based on taoist divination,"i thought this book was going to be a goddess-centered interpretation of the i-ching. instead it was a collection of images based loosely on the text, but without lending any true insight into the hexagrams. i also found some of the images disturbing. I ended up not even bringing it home."
5,What creepy excellent fun!,"We've all come to expect nothing less than wonderful books (adult or childrens) from this duo, and they don't dissapoint with this volume. The illustraions and story mesh perfectly. This is likely to scare some young readers, but they will be heartened by Lucy's brave defeat of the wolves. Others will laugh at the silly contortions of the wolves taking over the house (and the family in the garden). A perfect introduction to Neil and Dave's work...move on to Coraline or The Day I swapped my dad for 2 goldfish. (See if you can find the missing word ""she""'s not where she should be!)"
4,It's a really creepy book and I like creepy books,Whitney Wolves in the WallsBy Neil GaimanI would rate this book a four stars.If you like creepy things this book is for you.I like it when the wolves were scared of the family.I hated it when the family had to go outside and stay there.I also liked it when the wolves came out of the walls.The wolves came out of the walls. The family went outside but then they decided to be in the walls for a little while. But then the family came out of the walls and the wolvesWere scared so then the wolves went out of the house and ran where no family canCome out of the walls.This book is for CHILDREN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,Interesting,Cute story. Interesting/different artwork. I like the graphic novel aspect of telling part of the story only through the artwork.The heroine is very similar to Coraline.
1,Who is the audience for this?,"I have to agree with the librarian, this book is packaged like a book for small children, but reads like a book for older school aged children and adults. My kids did not see the humor, even after I tried to explain it to them, they just thought the pictures were scary and sad. I frankly found the story a little past creative and venturing in disturbing."
1,Wolves in the wall,"This is a very bad book, it's scary and not for children!!!!!!The person who wrote this probably does'nt have children.Don't buy this or read this to your children!!!!!!It will give them nightmares."
1,Too scary for most kids,"First, I couldn't get past the strong smell of the ink used! It's overpowering!! I found the illustrations of the wolves are so very dark and scary, that even without the story line, this book is not for any of my granchildren."
5,I'm 26 and I bought this for myself...and I'm not ashamed!,"I love Neil Gaiman and I love Dave Mckean, back from the first edition of Coraline. I bought the book for myself and I'm not ashamed. I love children's literature and I love Neil Gaiman's writing & Mckean's artwork. There is such a Tim Burton-ish, Roald Dahl-esque quality which occurs when these two team up; it's a haunting beauty. I think the story is fabulous, not too scary for young kids, & the art is breathtaking. Beautiful elaborate drawings.A+"
3,Age appropriateness may vary,"I checked this book out from the library to check for age appropriateness before I bought it because of the 1 and 2 star reviews. Bottom line, the book is borderline so you have to know your kids and use your common sense. It was too much for my 3 year old, but it's one of the few books ""cool enough"" for my 6 year old nephew to be caught dead reading. I'm glad I checked it out first because I wouldn't have been happy if I'd spent money on it."
3,Was worth the money but..........,The green and mauve floral design was poorly finished/put on this product.
5,This is a very neat book,"... with such great ideas. I would definately recommend it if you have any sort of pest problems... insects, spiders, gophers, etc indoors or out. And they don't hurt the animals. [...]"
3,A little too young,"I bought this for my three year old grandson. He loves playing with it; however, I believe some of the games are a little to advanced for him. Especially the ones that you need to use two hands. He just doesn't have the coordination to control both sides of the Leapster.I think I am going to hold on to it and give it back to him in six months. The games are great and the Leapster is fun, but maybe for a four year old or older."
2,sat on shelf collecting dust,"I thought this would be a great toy for my 6-yr-old. Boy was I wrong. It was played with for about 20 minutes, then never touched again. I tried a couple different cartridges in hopes that the new themes would help spur interest, but to this day, instead, the leapster lays on a shelf collecting dust. Neither of my children found it very interesting. The 3-yr-old found it too difficult to understand. The now 7-yr-old never had much interest in it ever. I liked it- and played with it for several minutes to try and get the kids interested in it. No luck."
3,"Brilliant but BREAKABLE, supervise use always","While I agree with the positive educational and entertainment elements of the wonderful tool, it does NOT hold up well. I've been through two. The first one, a Christmas gift, soon lost screen clarity after three weeks. Our attempts (as diligent parents) to calibrate the screen saw mediocre improvement... right before the Leapster just died. No notice, nothing.The second lasted between five and seven weeks. After eating two dozen batteries it no longer functions at all. Fresh batteries produce nothing.I can think of nothing our 6-year-old could have done. Play was usually supervised and the protective case carried, used and loved.When it's working, it's great. (...)3 stars rather than five strictly because of questionable durability."
3,"I HAD HIGH HOPES, BUT......","I was somewhat disappointed. I bought this last year for my 5 and 6 year old, primarily. Initially, it was great and they fought over it. But then we started having problems with the touchpad....and they continue. WAAAYY too much money to have these types of problems. Also, the thing goes through batteries like there's no tomorrow. But when it's working correctly, it's a great educational toy.....hopefully the company has improved on the newer model.DYB"
2,Same Screen problems as others,"Gone through 2 units and both developed screen problems and then I gave up. Never really ran long enough to experience the battery pain. My kids are not rough on toys.Like others the second unit went quicker than the first.I noticed the demo units in the store have a spring loaded stylus. I gues they know how to fix the problem, but just aren't interested in providing it to customers.A terrible blemish on an otherwise fun and entertaining toy."
3,Buyer Beware - Older Model is Better!!,"We bought our friends the older/triangular/rounded model over the holiday and they were having some basic trouble with it. The LeapFrog company suggested that she just exchange it for a new one (this model) to avoid future problems. They now have this new model and are very unhappy. The screen is about half of the original size, the new design is harder to hold on to and there are ""mini"" commercials for their other products when you turn on the device. They already have your money, this is supposed to be an educational toy, now marketing has taken over. We are very disappointed in this new product and urge any buyer to look for the other model."
2,"Great, Wonderful...and Then It Breaks...","Great learning tool my 3-yr. loves - but the screen stopped responding after only 2 weeks completely! Luckily, I'm still within my exchange time frame - this toy is potentionally so neat - why can't they make it last??"
5,So much better than the Leap Pad!,"We've bought so many of the Leap stuff and some of it my kids LOVE and some of it they never use. The Leapster is a real WINNER! My kids use them a lot. We've had two of them for a year now and they are going strong. They use them primarily in the car. The batteries last a decent amount of time and the games are interesting for them to use time and time again. Neither of my daughters care for the Leap Pad or the Writing one. So if you are trying to choose between them, I'd suggest the Leapster (it is much cheaper now too -- and with more games available, although pricey). My kids are now 5 and 3 1/2."
4,"Great Toy, Many Problems","My son got his Leapster when they just came out, Dec. 2003. We are now on our 3rd Leapster. I've noticed they have changed the touchscreen and pen on this last Leapster(the touchscreen seems more protected). We have now had this 3rd one for 3 months, and I have to say, no problems yet. I do think this is a wonderful, educational product, and my son just loves all of the cartridges, especially his new Spiderman one.(which is more for older kids. )I actually had to return this cartridge because his Leapster was not recognizing it. I don't mind dealing with the problems because it is a very educational product. Also, Leap Frog has been wonderful with me exchanging the Leapster, twice at their expense."
4,a great new toy,"So, far my daughter is loving the toy.....My only thing is that i wished they would have put the mouse or whatever they call it on the right side of the game not the left......for the younger kids using there left hand is a little harder then the right and hopefully they will be coming out with a glare screen...otherwise.....its great that it is educational and not just all fun....we need more educational toys....................."
3,X-mas Delivery,"I placed my order for this product on Nov 18th and have only just discovered that Target won't be able to ship it to me by X-mas. I find that ridiculous. My email order confirmation stated: Shipping estimate: Novemeber 19. Delivery estimate: November 23 - November 24. With such a description, I expected the item to be available on or around November 19. At worst, I expected that they would ship the item as soon as it became available, but certainly in time for X-mas. I think the shipping information provided is a bit misleading and extremely annoying."
1,Check the retailer's warranty before you buy!,"We bought this for our 3-year-old son, who absolutely loves it! BUT...after 4 months of use, it is malfunctioning and gets stuck in the middle of the games (very frustrating for a child). We have tried the reset button, replacing/removing the batteries, yet have not been able to fix it. Took it back to Toys R Us (with the reciept)in order to exchange it for a new one, however, Toys R Us has a very strict 45 day warranty/exchange policy and refused to let me exchange it (manager at store said ""I need to call the manufacturer and see what they can do"")...i.e., great product if you don't mind spending $70 every 4 months to replace it in the event it should malfunction.....As a fun and educational toy I would give this product ""5 Stars!"" However, I highly suggest purchasing this product through a different retailer."
5,A+ Toy for my 4 year old boy,"My son got a lot of educational games this year. He got several other products and I have to say this is his favorite. He plays with it for over an hour every day. I am looking forward to getting him more games. I haven't had any problems with the product yet. I did get the recharger kit and it doesn't always sit right to recharge, but beyond that I am happy and it doesn't run out of batteries too fast.He is happy and that makes this mommy happy."
3,Can't use in the Car,"Would be great if you could use in the car. I think my ds played with this 4 hours in 6 months. (...).. if you divide the time.Hate to say it, but my four year old likes the game boy and pixtar better. You can use the game boy and pixtar in the car too. Of course the game boy isn't very educational. That is probably why he likes it! Pixter is educational... for drawing and holding a pen."
2,"SENT ITEM WITH NO CARTRIDE,SHAME ON AMAZON",MY PACK WAS MISSING PARTS.HOPEFULLY I CAN GET THIS RESOLVED.BIG DISSAPPOINTMENT FOR MY CHILD.
1,Leapster is the worst handheld ever,I have watched my friend play with a leapster.He says he hates it but his mom nakes him play it.All it plays are learning games.I like pixter color better.Pixter color has a arcade cartrigde the plays non-learning arcade games.I would not (...)!
1,Very disappointed,"We bought this for our 4-yr-old daughter's bday. She LOVES Leapfrog, has the DVDS, my first Leappad, Little Touch Leappad and Leappad w/writing. She also has Leap bus, table, Princess Laptop..you get the idea, we highly endorse Leapfrog products. She could also read by the age of 2 and I mean she can read second grade level now. But she will not use the Leapster. She is very bored with it and will only play one or two games. I feel it is a great idea and perhaps your kids would be interested, but she prefers her leappad over it hands-down."
1,Not Satisfied,I bought this for my son and daughter last Christmas and within days they stopped working. Of course I did not have the box or anything so it was just a waste of money...
5,excellent product!!!!,I bought this for my 7 yr old a year ago and saved all of the packaging just in case because of some of the reviews saying the screen stops working or the buttons break etc.Well it's been a yr. and this thing has been stepped on thrown down the stairs chewed on and even got pee on it from my 1yr. old!!And it still works like new!!Every time I get a new game for my son it's like he has a new toy all over again.VERY well worth the money I HIGHLY recommend this toy.
5,Best money spent ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This is one of the best products on the market. Just wish they would come out with more games sooner. I have a 4yr old and he learned his ABC in a matter of a couple of weeks with ABC Factory. Thanks Leap Frog For This WONDERFUL product.
5,slumber party fun!,"I baught this for my 7yr. old daughter and 4yr. old son, and they have both played it everyday since christmas! My daughter just had a slumber party with 7 girls and I had to give them a timer and tell them to re set it for 5 min. that way they wouldn't fight over it!! All of the girls played that game when it was their turn and they didn't stop until the last one left!! My kids have not been gentle with it and I haven't had any problem with it, but I do have to change the batteries alot!! Well worth the money, and I think every child should have one!"
5,We are very pleased with this purchase BUT...,"My only complaint is that there are so few cartridges available. I'd love to see learning games and cartridges featuring much-loved characters like Disney Princess and Scooby Doo - like they have for Leap Pad. I went out tonight to Toys R Us to buy the Leapster Kindergarten cartridge. I was really diapointed to see that our store had about 100 SpongeBob cartridges and nothing else at all to offer. We talked to an employee and he told us that LeapFrog tends to ship tons of one cartridge and only a few of the others. We'd like to see more available - and it would also be nice if the cartridges spanned into grades 3 and 4. This toy could be useful for many years if they add new levels to it. Other than these issues, our son really loves his new Leapster."
5,WAHOO!,"I purchased this item for my son's Christmas present this year! I was hesitant at first, due to the fact that he has never played video games before...and I really didn't want him to have a ""dumb game"" that just encouraged him to sit and stare at a screen. HOWEVER, I crumbled to the pressure and purchased this item because of the great reviews that I had seen. It is a great, great learning tool (and I am a teacher..which means I can say that honestly), and he was hooked after just one game. We bought him the Spongebob game, and he begs to play with it. One thing that I like is that he is already mastering the counting by 5's and 10's skill..also, he is gaining major concepts in counting money,etc. It's durable, educational, and fun! Money well spent..WAHOO!!"
5,The best money I've ever spent,"I have bought the computer games, leap pads, and every other educational toy imaginable. My five year old daughter would play with them on occasion. Ever since I bought the leapster for Christmas I have to put a new pack of batteries in every week. That's how much she loves this game. She takes it everywhere. Even to bed because she doesn't want it out of her sight. It is the best money I have have spent, and what makes it even better is she loves it. I have recomended it to everyone I know."
2,Touch screen does not work,"I bought this for my 4 year old and am finding the touch screen does not work well with the software, which can cause lots of tears and frustration. I'm not sure if it is a software or equipment flaw. Even with fresh batteries the game can lock up and need to be restarted. I like the idea of the game, but wish it was more user friendly."
5,Pleased,"I was considering getting my daughter, who is 6, the Xbox until I heard this adverstised. I am so pleased with this learning tool. Much better then xbox or playstation2. This is a great product. Keep up the great work."
2,TARGET and Ordering this By XMAS,"I just called Targets online ordering number to find out the Shipping Soon timeframe since it will let you go ahead and order and pay for this now. According to Target.com they will not be ion for 4-6 weeks and WOULD NOT be shipped by Xmas if you are pre-ordering, same for the leapster games. I was about to preorder until I found this out so thought I would share. They did say the brick &amp; mortar stores will have them but these online will not ship in time for Dec. 25. Hope this help."
5,LeapFrog Leapster is great!,I got this for my 3 yr old daughter for Christmas. She love her video game. We got more games for her which keeps her interest. She loves to color on it. It even survived being dropped on the bathtub (no one was in the tub thank God!) We let it dry out for a week or so and it is functioning normally. It has been dropped and is taken everywhere. A god educational toy that should last long enough for my two yr old to use.
4,Looking for education at a value?,"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my son, who has just turned 5. I took it to work to try it out during my break and to make sure it worked properly. Well, what fun we all had with it. Everyone at work had to try it too and most didn't want to give it up! The game that comes with it is by far the best of the three that I have. I bought the Kindergarden and the SpongeBob cartridges as well. I was a bit disappointed in Spongebob though, as it only includes three games. We do alot of traveling, and this will be a great way to keep my son occpuied on long trips-not to mention the educational value. With three levels of skill in most games, it provides a challenge for all ages. And with the carrying case, it is compact and well protected. All together the game has probabaly been used this a total of over eight hours and so far we are still on the original batteries."
5,Its actually educational!,"My 4 year old daughter has ALOT of toys, the video now, a fake camera, a few computer games but she was having a tough time learning.I thought I would try a Pixter, until I saw the Leapster! Its very easy to use and actually an electronic toy thats educational. We own dora, spongebob, barbie, and every cartridge under the sun! She now counts, spells, and even adds! Shes learning well with the leapster, and I doubt she even knows it. I am so happy I bought this ""gadget"" for her. Its easy to use, doesnt kill bateries (Although we have a re-charger since that Video Now goes through them like theres no tommorow!). Its pretty durable (my 10 month old sons have gotten a hold of it and havent broken it yet!) It shouldnt be dropped or anything, but its held up to slight abuse...I usually dont enjoy purchasing weird electronics for my children, but this leapster was a neccesity... GREAT FOR LEARNING!"
5,Keeps both 4 and 6-year old busy!,"My daughter got this for Christmas last year and plays with it often. Both she and my middle child, who is 4, really enjoys the Kindergarten cartridge. Unfortunately, their 2-year-old little brother gets ahold of it occastionally and so far has permanently damaged part of the screen and torn off the stylus (pen) used to write on the screen. They still enjoy it, though. The only down side is the expense. The unit itself is costly, then all the cartridges are sold separately and aren't cheap either, then to keep from going through batteries like crazy, you'll want to get the charging station, also sold separately. The carrying case is sold separately.... Something to consider if you're buying it as a gift for someone else's child. The pressure will be on them then to buy all the rest of the stuff. But for those who can afford it, it's a great learning toy. Especially for traveling."
2,Doesn't last,"I bought a leapster for my daughter for Christmas of 2008, well fast forward 11 mths later and the darn thing won't power on anymore.Customer service was a real help after giving them all of my information and being put on hold I was informed it was past the 90 day warranty and that there was nothing they could do about it.So I let them know I wasted my money on something that doesn't last and told them I would be posting a review here about it too!Buyer beware, We have 3 leapsters in our house and only 1 of them works correctly all of the time.Our other one has dead spots or needs to re-calibrated all of the time and of course the first one won't turn on at all either!"
5,Best money spent so far,"This toy has already provided my son with hours of entertainment. He doesn't even have a game for it yet. We decided to see how our 3 year old would do with the system's games first. HE LOVES IT. He picked up the concept very quickly, and to my surprise, knows exactly what buttons to push with very little help at the start. We also look for durability in a product, as he is only 3, and his sister is not yet 2. (She tends to pick up his toys). He has dropped it by accident a few times; again, pleasantly surprised... no scratches, dents, and still works fine!"
2,Lots of glitches,"We bought this item for Christmas 2005. I would recommend keeping your receipt and box for return. The Leapster worked fine for 2 weeks, but now lots of glitches and power outages. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. Of course, we had just trashed the receipt and box. Very frustrating for 5 year old, as well as us! When it works, it is a fun learning tool."
3,2 out of 3,"I have three sons twins, age 4 and one older boy, age 5. They love this toy and play often. However, after only 4 months the touch screen on one of the Leapsters stopped working. Overall, I like the toy but I am hesitant to replace the broken one. Who knows how long it'll work??"
2,good media..... bad hardware,my 5 year old loved it untill it broke 3 months later. i exchanged it and it broke again 4 month later..... there is somthing worng with the touch screen and its clibration. it is too sensitive for my child.
4,Don't be rough on it...,"We purchased this toy for our son last Christmas, and it was the #1 hit in our house. Both my son (6.5 yrs) and my daughter (4.5 yrs.) loved it. We took it on vacation this April, and a heavy-handed friend of my son's played with it, ruining the screen (he pressed the stylus on the monitor too hard). The screen now has black lines down it and you can't see well anymore. I tried to contact the company via email to see if we could get the screen replaced, and they NEVER REPLIED.So, I'd have to lean toward the ""buyer beware"" camp of these ratings. My son is very dissappointed.Good luck..."
2,pen doesn't work on leapster!,"I bought a leapster for my daughters 5th birthday.May 2004.I was thrilled with the product at first,my daughters alittle behind in her learning skills so I thought this would help alot!Well this is October 27 and it doesn't work.No matter what I've tried the pen doesn't work on the screen.It's 5 months old and comes with a 3 month warranty.I've called Leapfrog after writting this review and they have told me send it in well send you a new leapster.The company is very nice and overlooking the fact it was over 3 months old show's their customer care.I think their A+.I just hope this leapster lasts longer."
2,Only worked for two weeks,"My 3 and 6 year old loved the item but after buying it for Christmas, it only worked for two weeks before the touchscreen stopped working. I then found a number of websites where people report this is a very common problem and has been for at least a year. Some people have returned two, three, even four of them."
5,A great learning tool!!,"I got this for my daughter (Age 3) when they first came out and it is a great investment in your childs education and learning skills. The games are educational and exciting, she never gets tired of playing them. I highly reccommend it."
5,the best toy on the market!,"My daughter had had this for 9 months and there has not been a day she has not played with it. Even her 2 year old brother has figured it out. the graphics are great, very clear. The size of the screen is nice. I would recommend this toy to anyone!"
4,"Finally, A Fun Educational Toy","My three (almost four) year old loves his Leapster. He takes it everywhere. I am loving how well it keeps him entertained in the car and even at restaraunts. I only wish that they made software for the popular characters for each age group. He really wants the Incredibles but it is appropriate for much older children.I was concerned because I had read reviews indicating that the screen was too fragile. My son has dropped it on the sidewalk several times and so far, it has held up beautifully.Also, though he has used it daily for several weeks, we are still on our first set of batteries."
2,gad,"this falls in the catagory of tries to do to much and sucks at everything.first of all, we purchased it for my sister for christmas, and she NEVER uses it. first of all, the touch screen barley works,(if you draw a line, it does the jaged thang)and the games are boring (the only games that my sister has ever played was the free game that came with it. they have already made another version of it. My sister always uses my DS (nintendo ds) or listen to my ipod. buy your kids a nintendo ds, and get your kids games that are fun to play rather than educational."
5,"Excellent toy concept, poor screen calibration quality","Our daughters (ages 6.5, 3.5) love the Leapster...BUT, we've gone through two units and both have the screen calibration problem that someone mentioned earlier below. The units worked great for about two days and then the stylus became off, so we tried both methods of calibration (with cartridge and without per the company's help phone line), both failed to complete and thus the stylus became useless. Barring this issue, the toy would be fantastic. We're disappointed on the screen calibration issue and quality."
3,Not Too Happy with the Quality,"I originally purchased the Leapster in September for my 5-year old's birthday. For about three weeks, she used it continually and loved every minute of it. She used both the included game cartridge as well as the Dora Game. After this time, it became apparent that the screen was simply not responding to all the pen touch commands. Over time, the problem was progressing until I finally returned the toy to K-Mart and got a replacement. This time, it didn't take three weeks for the touch screen problems to start. She simply put down the toy only to be disappointed every time she attempted to play. I've since returned the toy again."
3,"A Love, Hate relationship with Leapster","My 5 year old son loves his Leapster, but it eats batteries and goes off and on. At first I thought it was low battery, but this isn't always the case. There is a malfunction in the leapster as well. The leapster is not "" parent friendly "".A Love, hate relationship with Leapster."
2,DO SOME RESEARCH BEFORE YOU DECIDE....,"This is an 'older' system version from Leapfrog.You may want to check the Leapster Explorer or the Leapster-2. The L-Max is a what older system now. We owned one a while back. Had a bad experience with it. Had to get a replacment. You can check my review on it Leapster L-Max Learning Game System. But check out theLeapFrog Leapster 2 Learning Game System - Greenor theLeapFrog Leapster Explorer Learning Game System (Green), before you decide. These are both much more recent systems from Leapfrog, at MUCH better prices then the price of the L-max here. The Explorer is the most recent system from Leapfrog. Do some research before you decide."
5,Great learning system,This is a great device and I'm glad Amazon is offering it. It is helping my nephew learn and is a great part of his learning base. This product along with TTV have helped him win Science fair if you believe in learning also look at [...]
5,A must for any long trip!,"This is one of the best toys I've ever bought. It is the best Leapfrog toy we own as well. My daughter couldn't let go of her friend's so we got her own. We brought it on a 5 hour flight to Hawaii. It entertained her most of the way without annoying other passengers (you can plug in earphones). It has also entertained her through countless long road trips. I love that she learns letters, math, and words while having fun. We own two additional games Dora and Kindergarden. She loves to put in new games and I love that there is far less stuff to lug around (no books). I have not had any problems with our unit either."
1,WHEN IT WORKS - it's 5 Stars !!!!,"We are now on our 3rd Leapster and the stylus is again not synching correctly with the screen. When you 'point' to a '1' a '3' gets clicked and so on...However Leapster is great and has swapped them for us in the past, [...] - that said though when it works our 5 year old will play on it for hours - recommend you get the rechargeable power pack or buy shares in Duracell....!!"
4,Best Gift for fun and learning,"5 yr old grandson, has all types of toys and video games to play, but likes this one best because of the different levels of games to play. Never boring for him as he can ramp up the challenges the leapster offers and its mobility makes it so he can take when he travels. I don't have an opinion on the durability yet. Overall I feel $ well spent."
5,Great buy,I bought this toy for my 6 year old for Christmas and she loves it. It's very educational. I have not yet bought any cartridges for it so she is only playing the games that come preloaded but she is having fun and she has already told me what cartridges I should buy. Seeing how much fun she is having with it I will definetly buy the other games for her.I love the fact that she can count and spell and colour with it. It keeps her occupied in the car and even her 11 year old sister and myself play with it as well. It's really fun to use.
3,Leapster has it's ups and downs,"The Leapster has many fun and educational games for kids, but it has a downside to it. The battery life is awful. It uses 4 AA batteries and gives us about 3 hours of play. The other downside is the screen. It stops responding to touch or the pen. Sometimes we have to press extremely hard to get it to work. This is not because of misuse because we hardly get to use it since we never have batteries for it. I think something that costs this much money should work really well. We only had ours for about a month when we noticed screen problems. I hope this helps someone else decide if they want to purchase or not. I wouldn't recommend it (unless you get it on sale)!"
5,great educational toy,"The best learning toy I ever bought my son. It is a must for every family with preschool and school age children. Daycares must have this toy! Leapster made his first reading experience enjoyable Just in few weeks my son is capable to read simple lines, this is a great educational toy!It's easy to operate and really lets children play and learn at the same time. I'm so happy to see my kid improving his reading and phonics skills using this well-structured interactive toy and playing with his favorite characters."
5,EVERYONE WANTS TO PLAY,"I am a mom of four ages 14, 9, 6 and 3 I bought this for my 6 yr. old daughter for her birhtday and she loves it. The Dora game is great it teaches so much including spanish. The graphics are great the sound is great and the price is very reasonable. I have played as well as my 14 & 9 yr. old sons and they wish they had one of these when they were younger. This is a product that will not be put on a shelf and forgotten, if you have small children this is a great investment."
5,Leapster: A Learning Experience,We got this for our 3 1/2 year old granddaughter for Christmas. I don't think she has put it down since Christmas Eve. Great learning toy for the preschoolers and has some really fantastic add-on software.
5,Perfect gift,"I bought this for my four year old daughter and she absolutely loves it! She wanted the Nintendo DS but I thought that product was too expensive for her age and bought the leapster instead. She thinks it is awesome, even better than a DS. And I love the educational games."
5,This is the best,"My 4 year old son received the leapster for Christmas, along with the Dora and Spongebob cartridges. He loves it and plays with it all the time. It is really a fun way to learn. The games have three levels which fit any childs capabilities. He has had the leap pad and the power touch in the past and bother were taken back because he NEVER played with them. He is constantly reciting things he learned through the games. And I have to comment on the durability. He accidentally pushed it off a counter 4 ft off of ceramic tile, and there was nothing wrong with it. I would recommend this toy. I am especially happy that it is an educational toy that has 'action games' and not those other handheld games that have sock 'em hit 'em games."
5,Best Present This Year!!!,Chalk another one up for Leap Frog Products. This toy is amazing. My 5 1/2 yr old recieved this as a Christmas present and has hardly put it down. We took it with us to visit relatives and my 11 yr old neice (as well as her mom) played with it the whole time we were there. It's like having an educational game boy that can do tons more. She has a Pixter from last year and I can say that this blows it to pieces. It does everything that it did plus about 20 things more as well as doing it all in color.I only hope that more software will be available soon!!!!
5,Great even for younger kids,"I bought this to keep my 2 and a half year old baby girl entertained on the plane ride from San Diego to New York, and it was awesome! She loved to doodle, and she also got the shape matching game (comes with it) and she loved that, too. I love this toy, and I know we will get many years of use out of it (She plays with other stuff now that we are home, since I really want to save this for when she is older and can FULLY appreciate this one), but all in al a very user-friendly, easy and fun toy. Ours is pink though (couldn't find it on here).We got extra insurance on this from Toys R Us, but if it breaks after that and the repairs or whatever are nto covered under warrantee, I will still buy another one. This is a keeper. Another winner form LeapFrog."
1,Most poorly made item I've ever bought!!,"I would not recommend this item to anyone. Last Christmas I bought it for my daughter, she played with it for a short period of time, loved it, but the touch screen stopped working right. Certain parts of the screen wouldn't work. So we brought it back and got another one. Guess what? It did the SAME thing! And I hate to even say it, but I brought that one back and got a third, I thought it was working better, it was for a while, but after a month or so, she couldn't even play some of the games because the screen slowly started doing the same thing again!! So take it from me, three bad ones can not be a fluke, the touch screen on this item is POORLY MADE. I was very disappointed and so was my daughter."
1,Stylus Problems,"I must have a Lemon. I also bought my 4 year old a Leapster for Christmas. We are having problems with the stylus not getting a response when touching the screen. In calibration mode, I can not get a response from the top right hand corner or middle targets with the stylus. We also have difficulty having the stylus to work when choosing a ""player"" and at various other places throughout the programming.Update: I have returned my Leapster for a replacement. The replacement works flawlessly. There must have been a bad batch."
3,"Good learning, bad mechanics!!!","I bought this item to give my almost 4 year old daugther an alternative from a game boy her brother has. It has been one week and the screen does not respond anymore and can not be recalibrated either. I am extremely dissapointed and today I am going back to the store to return it. if they do not return my money, Leapfrog will here from me. Also I think is to big to handle."
2,It's a risky purchase,"Bought this last year for Christmas for my 3 yr. old son. For a year I thought he was leaving it on because it never seemed to have a charge. Instead of getting better the problem kept getting worse. Until finally, I put new batteries in it and it indicated no charge before it even booted. When I contacted their customer service department, Leap Frog told me there was nothing they could do because it was more than 90 days old. My older son has the Leapster L-Max and likes it and the games are educational and age appropriate...when they work."
5,Awesome Leapster,"I was wanting to get my 4 year old nephew his ""own"" handheld game, the gameboy is still a little too advance (his 8 year old brothers), I saw this in a Toys R Us flier, read some reviews and bought it. I took it over to my sister's house to show her how cool it was and neither one of us could put it down. My brother-in-law even thought it was cool. When my nephew gets it for his birthday (in January, felt the need to buy early due to its popularity) I think he's going to love it! Very fun and educational! Enjoy!"
5,Ultimate Fun and Instructional Toy,"I have got to tell you what is so great about the Leapster. My son is 5 years old and has had the Leapster for 2 years. He is bilaterally deaf, meaning he was born deaf in both ears. He started becoming interested in video and electronic games/toys early on. My husband and I stumbled upon this product when we returned his Pixter, after the glass screen shattered on one of our hospital trips. We were going to exchange the Pixter for another one when we saw that the Leapster had a larger screen and looked more durable. My son will not put it down. He stays focused and calm when he plays the Sponge Bob and Kindergarten game cartridges. The buttons and flow of the games are so easy, my son is able to navigate the controls with ease and confidence. My 3 year old daughter will be getting her own Leapster this Christmas! If you are looking for a interactive toy, this is the buy of the year. You'll see the improvements in their education/knowledge/grades also..."
2,Its good -but beware!,"I have purchased two leapsters (originals) because my kids love them and they learn alot. Yes, you go through alot of batteries, but something you must know is we have had problems with both and have sent them both back to Leap Frog to receive replacements. However, both are acting up again. One wont recalibrate and the other makes an annoying sound when a game is inserted. What you need to know if that LeapFrog only warranties these for 6 MONTHS! I personally think this wrong! You pay alot for these systems and I think that they should stand behind their products alittle better than that. Just wanted to give all of you this notice before you consider buying it."
4,Not so durable,"We purchased the Leapster for our daughter last Christmas and she likes it (although she says she would rather have a DS). However, last month she was sitting on a step stool (very low to the ground) and the Leapster slipped out of her hands and fell to the tile floor. The leapster has not worked since and I have tried everything. This is a children's toy and should be able to withstand a fall to the floor without permanent damage. We were very disappointed and could not even blame our daughter. It was just an accident. That having been said, we are shelling out for a new one this Christmas, but be warned and do not drop it."
5,Great learning tool,My child received this game christmas '03 and we are still enjoying the learning outcomes. The compact style allows transport anywhere. The directions are clear on it use and there is a hint button for my child to activate if in doubt of the next step. I like the pause button so she can be interuppted to clean her room or turn of a light and still not miss a beat on her learning or game as she calls it.It is entertaining to watch my child sing along with the activity and recoginize words on the street that she has been taught while playing with the leapster. Learning is fun with leapster. I am not sure if she realizes that she is learning. There are all sorts of challenges and on different level options.The down side is that only one person can play at a time while signed in. There is no way for a two person game.
5,Leapster for a 5 year old,"The Leapster is a great way to keep my 5 year old looking and listening to the stories to be able to get into the games. It helps him listen for story details an understand the way a story is put together. A great ""toy"""
4,Great for young children,Both of my children love the leapster. We just bought a second one for our 8 year old. The only problem is with the battery cover. There is a spring covered screw that broke almost immedately. The toy still functions fine despite the battery cover problem and it keeps the kids entertained for hours. It is great on long road trips.
5,Great learning toy even for childen with delays,"My 3 1/2 year old son is speech and language delayed. However, he's managed to figure out how to play the games without much help. He understands the simple instructions and has learned words along the way. He would spend hours on this computer if I allowed him. By far the best investment I've made in awhile."
5,Worth EVERY penny.,"I purchased the Leapster game system for my four year old son for Christmas. He had no desire at all to learn his letters. It's one month later and he(and his 3 year old sister) knows all his letters and the sounds that they make. I highly advise buying the charging stand. It's worth the extra expense. Three hours of charging gives you ten hours of play time. We love not having to keep up with books. We keep the Leapster and his games in his old ""My First LeapPad"" backpack. I'm just sorry I waited so long to get one."
1,Reviews are bunk (Buyer beware),"I've been to 5 major online retail stores and each had a review section, but they lure you in saying you can win 100 dollars buy submiting the best review. Well the catch is its for the one they choose to be the best for that week. So what does that tell you? People are writing bogas positive reviews just to see if they can win the 100 dollar prize. But no one reading these reviews knows that prizes were awarded for the best reviews. I feel like calling the BBB for placing incentives on writing a good review, when it should be a straight opinionated submition like we are told when we read them."
2,He doesn't like it.,I bought the game hoping it would help him with his times tables. My son doesn't like this game. I can't get him to play it. I've tried it. It's just not that interesting. I was a little worried I had wasted my money on the leapster system. I decided to try batman instead. He loves that game! My husband started playing it and I couldn't get him to stop! Don't waste your money on this game. Try something else.
3,LeapFrog Learning Game,"I can't easily rate this game, it was purchased at some distance from the recipient, our grandson (4,500 miles) and all I can say is that it was something on his wish list, it arrived on time and presumably in good condition, we'll only get to have a demonstration in December when we go over for Christmas."
3,Which Leapster to get?,"I see that a new (and smaller) leapster has come out. It is the same size as the L-Max (but does not have the TV function) and it therefore has a screen that is an inch smaller than the original leapster. Did any of you find that the original leapster was too big or bulky for little hands? If you had the choice of getting one in a smaller size (BUT, it has a smaller screen too!) would you get it? I am inclined to think a smaller screen is not good for younger kids. But, the smaller size is nice. Opinions, please. Should I stick with the original one or go for the smaller unit??"
1,Screen problems on two units,"The item is alot of fun, my daughter loves it and takes more care with it than any toy, but last February, she had a dead spot on the screen, so Leapfrog send a replacement unit. Now 9 months later, the replacement' screen will not show any images at all. Leapfrog says it is out of warranty.....This game has been used only on weekends and only in bed so wear and tear is not the issue. So beware, it is a very delicate thing. If the store you buy it at offers extended warranties do yourself a favor and buy it."
2,very disapointed,We bought this for our son as a birthday gift 6 months ago. He loves it when it works.we are on our 4th one now. we bought the batery pack because it eats bateries. he has several of the games and loves them all . he'll play it for hours. every one that we have had seems to have the same problem. The screen just goes dead in the center. My sister is on her third. the same thing is hapening to hers. I can't say it's from missuse. I am at the point that I don't even want to buy anymore games for it. It gets to be expensive at 20$ ea and the thing is always breaking. I would recomend the extended waranty for this toy if you decide to buy it. It is great fun but duribility is not so great.
5,Wonderful!,"My child plays with this every single day. He has learned so much from the cartridges. I cannot believe there is such a wonderful product out there! I would buy this, and all the cartridges for your child. We have the case, also. It's super durable. I adore this product."
3,"If it works, it's great.","I ordered this for my 5-yr old grandson for his birthday, along with two cartridges. He also received three other cartridges from other relatives. He played with it for two days and LOVED it. Then when he went to put it on again, it wouldn't go on. My daughter-in-law researched the troubleshooting site and did all of the items they suggested -- to no avail. I had to return the item. I then ordered a second unit, since he already had 5 cartridges. So far, so good - it seems to be working fine. Hopefully this unit will last long enough for him to get some use out of all of his games. I am disappointed in LeapFrog for putting out an item that seems to fail so easily. Their reputation is really hurt by this."
5,Leapfrog does it again,"We began falling in love with Leapfrog products about 4 years ago. We have two LeapPads, Turbo Twist Spelling, Imagination Desk and now a Leapster. How perfect to have a personal sized ""video game"" for younger kids. I'm not a big fan of video games because they're addicting but this is so educational. We've only had it for a week and my 5 year old loves it. She has learned how to add and it's helping her with reading.I only wish that they had games for kids older than 8. My 8 year old wanted a Leapster but since it only went up to age 8 I thought it might be too easy for her. So my 5 & 8 year olds switch off between the Gameboy and the Leapster but the Leapster is my preference over Gameboy."
5,Awesome learning experience,"This toy has been a lifesaver. My soon to be four year old thought he needed a Nintendo DS, but Santa talked him into this. He absolutely loves it! It is just amazing to watch how they soon learn what letters are what, numbers, colors, and shapes. This just added to what he already knew, but makes him think! Thank you leapster!"
4,Almost 4 year old really enjoying this so far...,"I bought my almost 4 year old the leapster after returning the V-tech V-smile (see my review of the V-smile for more info).I am really pleased with it so far. Graphics are good, the stylus pen it comes with is easy to use, and the games seem much more educational than the V-smile ones. My only real complaint is that the colors on the screen are sometimes hard to distinguish, but maybe I need to see it with 3 year old eyes. Anyway, so far so good, seems to be worth the $$ I shelled out for it. I also like the portability of this thing-it will make long car rides a bit more pleasant for everyone I hope."
5,Guarantees Quiet Time,I have an active four year old who needs constant action. I am amazed with the quiet time this Leapster has allowed me. She is so into the games that she gets lost into it. It is very educational as well. We took a three hour car trip and I didn't hear a peep! You can change out the games as to not bore your child of the same things. There are different levels of challenge. I HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend!Allison C.
5,My best investment ever!,"I was so happy, that 3 weeks after christmas, my children play with their leapsters. I have a 4yr. old son and a 6yr. old daughter, they usually fight and bother each other if left in a room too long. But, with their leapsters they play with them for hours. If they have to go to the restroom or get something to drink, they pause it. When it's time for their meals they pause it. They never want to put it down, and it is great learning. I have to buy more cartridges before they master the games and it is only January. I recommend the leapster game system for any parent. It is great!"
5,hours of fun,"Some children can't go to bed without their favorite stuffed animal, my four year old can't go to bed without his leapster. He loves it! He got it for Christmas and has played with this I think every day since. It's educational and it's fun. Boy I wish they had something like this when I was young.This toy is also perfect for those long car rides. I know it's a newly introduced product and they don't have alot of cartidges out yet, especially for the younger set, but I've bought every one a four year old can understand - and am waiting for more to be developed and available. The bottom line is - this is the best ""toy"" I have ever purchased for my son."
1,defective but great,"this product arrived defective. This is the second leapster i have purchased for my grand children and both they and the parents love them. Educational, fun and reliable with good battery life.Amazon took the defective unit back, no hassle and shipped a new unit immediately. You have got to love that kind of combination. I have also found the customer reviews immensely valuable when buying for kids that grow so quickly and ones you don't see very often."
3,"Great toy, but needs improving","While this is a great educational tool, it only worked about a month. My daughter loves this handheld game, but the calibration need some work. We tried to recalibrate when certain areas of the screen were not functioning well and it could not be done. I did call Leap Frog and since it wass under warranty it could be replaced. I sure hope this one lasts longer!!!"
1,Piece of junk for the money,"I thought this game was great for about the first week, then the touchscreen stopped working. You can't even get into the games because the calibration doesn't work on the unit. I've read of numerous problems of this sort and am furious that I paid over $70.00 for something with such a serious defect. The cartridges are ridiculously priced as well, and we bought 5 of them for my daughter; that means about $125 of software that is virtually useless unless I want to drop another $70 bucks on another leapster and take my chances that it works. Spend you money on books instead...there is nothing educational about a child who is frustrated because he/she keeps trying to spell his/her name and the unit won't respond!"
2,disappointed,"I spent over an hour trying to get this thing to work when the kids opened their presents. Come to find out there is some issue with the battery cartridge. I got an adapter for it and that works, but it is not a portable game now. I buy all my gifts around August for Christmas, so the warranty is expired. After reading the reviews, I don't think I will bother with replacing it. Might try upgrading though."
3,fun but unreliable,"I have 2 Leapster 2 portable handhelds, and one constantly just turns itself off in the middle of games. The other one, that actually worked, just died. It will not even turn on with adapter or new batteries. I even tested it with the other battery panel from my 2nd handheld. This toy keeps my boys entertained on trips and vacations. They enjoy all the games and have favorites too-Walle and Kung Fu, but I'm SO not happy with the machine itself. It seems like poor quality... I mean, these have never been dropped, only used when in the car or on planes and in hotel rooms. They aren't even a year old and I have had problems with both. So, my advice is, if you are going to get one, be aware that you must have fun while they last! LF said they'd send me a new one, but I have to pay shipping and return the old one, which probably means I am getting a used one that has been fixed by them. Not sure, but as a former software quality assurance tech, I'm not impressed."
4,Perfect for a 4 year old grandson,"I bought this toy for my grandson's 4th birthday. He loves the idea that his name appears when he turns it on. With little or no help he was off and running with many of the programs. I like that there is variety - reading, spelling, math, fine motor dexterity. It's also a great transitional toy from active play to calming down for bed."
5,Thank you LeapFrog,My 6yr old son received it for his bday in Oct. He was the moste engrossed I've ever seen. I loved the great hand-eye coordination it give. He can look as cool as his peers with their Gameboy. And it is more educational. In fact my 2 1/2 yr old Daughter loves it so much I had to buy her own for Xmas. She is almost as adept at it as her older brother. Great Choice. Also the rechargable battery and charger accessory is a MUST have!! The rechargable batteries last 10 hours of playtime whereas you will replace the regular batteries so frequently your head will spin. I got the rechargables three weeks ago and I still haven't needed to place on the recharger since the first charge!! It's great!! Thank You LeapFrog
5,Great Fun without problems,"We had bought this toy for our 3yr old daughter and she loves it. We currently have all the games and hope for more. She is constantly playing with this on long trips and at night, instead of the TV.I wish I had read some of the reviews before purchasing this product. It has been one month so far and of course the pen doesn't respond to certain spots on the screen. I had calibrated the screen several times and since then had customer support help. There is a dead spot on the lower left, and now need to take it back to the store for a new one. Hopefully the problems are worked out since I don't feel like making a monthly trip for a new one.Great educational toy, bad quality."
3,A lot of mixed feelings,"I bought a Leapster for my twin boys' 3rd birthday in April 2004. The software is wonderful; it's educational and the boys really have fun playing the games. However, after about a year the touch screen stopped working. The Leap Frog customer service was very helpful and sent me a replacement (refurbished) unit right away. That one worked for about a month then its touch screen stopped working as well. I am now waiting to receive another replacement.I really have mixed feelings about this product. It is a great product when it is working. I have always been very impressed with Leap Frog products, especially the way they make educational games fun for kids. However, this screen problem is very frustrating. Based on some of the other reviews, it appears that this is a common problem. On the other hand, their customer service is excellent and they send a replacement quickly. I just hope that I do not have to continue sending Leapsters back to be replaced every few months."
5,Very good learning tool.,"The Leapster is built rugged, My son just rec'd it for his 4th birthday. He's dropped it on concret and carpeted flooring. Still worked!Anyways, It is like a PDA screen. They did an excellent job designing this and using good parts. Get one, I'm 38 and I like to play with it. (When my son is taking his nap)-dad"
2,Great educational game... Disappointing results,"I purchased two leapsters in July 2005 for my 5 year old twins(boy & girl). They immediately loved it and the learning concepts are great. However, I would not recommend purchasing this item, my kids are very disappointed now because the touch screen no longer works, thus making it impossible to get any further use out of the unit as they are unable to log in. I have tried communicating with leapfrog but to no avail. This item is highly priced and has a limited life span. I am now stuck with 10 cartridges and no unit to utilize them...tough luck for my kids eh? PITY!!!"
5,Happy Mom,"This is truly the best product Leap Frog has made (and we have many of their products). My four year old received this for Christmas. It was such a hit, my neighbor is taking her Leap Pad Writing back to exchange for Leapster. My best friend (mother of 6 year old), who always complains about the price of game boy advance sp, is getting her son a Leapster today. My son plays this like it's a video game, but he's learning the entire time."
4,No complaints.,"We bought this for my son's third birthday, and almost two years later he still loves playing with it. It has been very durable, and most importantly doesn't drain batteries at a ridiculous pace. Some of the games available for this system are better than others, but overall we've been extremely happy with our purchase."
2,"Nice but CAUTION, it will short out and stop working on you!!","I purchased this product for my son when he was 3. He only played with it a few times. Just as he was starting to ask to play with it, it stopped working and it was not because the batteries were dead or because he abused it. The same thing also happend to a friend."
5,Finally an Electronic Toy Worth Buying!,"It's beyond me why it took so long for a toy maker to create a fun and electronic toy, but Leapfrog has saved the day. It's not too big and not too small. The graphics aren't outstanding, but are clear and colorful. My five year old son quickly taught himself how to use the buttons and stylus. He's even caught me playing with his leapster when he wasn't looking. My only complaint is the software is too pricey."
5,This Is So Cool!,"I've never been so impressed with a product that I would actually write a review. But the Leapster is just that cool. Blows Pixter out of the water. Bought it for my 5yr old for Christmas, had to play with it first myself. I tested the Sponge Bob software. It's like watching the cartoon on a mini TV at times. The games are so much fun. He'll be learning without even realizing it. My son wanted a Game Boy. His little mind is like a sponge, I couldn't bring myself to do it so early. With the Leapster we'll both be happy. He has hand held video games with all his favorite characters and I know he's learning at the same time! As for the duribility, guess I'll find out once it's played with. Thank you LeapFrog for making learning fun!"
2,One major problem,"I think the Leapster is actually a great system. I just bought it a few weeks ago for her birthday. However I cannot give it high marks for one reason; My daughter has played it, probably added up, two hours. We just went through our THIRD set of batteries. She has never been able to make it past one story reading. We bought games to go with it, but have no idea if they are good or bad, because we've not been able to get that far. The batteries die, then it sits for a while until I change them again. She plays for a little bit, they die, and then it sits again. Its very upsetting!"
5,AWESOME GAME SYSTEM!!,"We bought this for my almost 5 year old for Christmas. I had thought about getting her a Gameboy advance for the last year but then this came out. It is larger and easier for little hands to hold and handle. This game is even better than having computer games because it is portable. The quality is amazing and my daughter loves all of the five games we have bought so far. The games are all super educational and I even had to stop and think when playing a few of the games on the third level, so I know she'll be able to play this system for years to come! This was really a great creation on Leap Frog's part! My daughter was getting tired of the Leap Pad and needed something a little more hands on, so this was perfect!"
2,The curse of the little tiny squares,"I work for a package delivery service. I ordered two pair. The first thing I noticed was the comfort. Very comfortable. The palm and fingers are covered with these little squares which give the gloves their tackiness. After the first day I noticed some of the squares had fallen off. Day two, many more had fallen off. By the end of the first week 80% to 90% of the squares were gone. The second pair has worn better. After two weeks, only 10% to 20% have come off. I like the the gloves. I don't like having these little tiny squares all over the floor of my truck. I also would like the gloves to last much, much longer."
1,"dissapointed, waste of money!",These gloves were not what i expected at all! I work with cardboard boxes all night and these were definitely not worth the money! not a sticky or tacky grip from the start and the same night wearing them they lost all its gripness! by the 2nd day it was just about all gone and were even more slippery! i would stay away from these gloves if your seeking a good grip and something that will last a little longer!
5,Great DVD Player for the money!,"I can't say enough great things about this DVD player! Perfect portability, nice viewing screen, full charge lasts for entire length of most movies - about 2-2.5 hours. Seems very rugged but I would highly recommend a dvd player case just to keep it in prestine condition. I purchased a Targus DVD backpack to carry mine in. Fits quite nicely. I had previously purchased the Coby 7"" dvd tablet player and it didn't work at all. Wouldn't read the dvd's (even new ones) and kept making a scratching noise. Needless to say I sent it back right away and bought this one instead. You won't be disappointed. Enjoy!"
1,Turn off!,"This unit was very easy to set up, but I had a big problem with it. If the answering machine was left on (which I always do), EVERY time I set the handset back in to the base, the system reset itself. I'd lose my outgoing message and password. If I turned the unit off, I had no problem - but the purpose of an answering machine is to have it on! I was very disappointed, especially because my other phone - and previous answering system - were GE, and they were great."
1,"poor quality, poor battery life, not worth the price","I have owned several of these phones in the past. The first worked perfectly for several years. I was so happy with the performance of the first phone that I continued to purchase them. Though the price has remained reasonable, the quality has taken a nosedive. The battery life is the main problem. Though I have replaced the battery several times, the batteries themselves are very weak. In the long run, they haven't been worth the hassle of continually replacing phones and batteries. I'll never give a second glance at one of these worthless phones again."
1,don't buy this one,"the phone doesn't have a place to plug in a headset. I hadn't thought to check that, as I thought it was standard now on a 2.4mhz phone. Then, the phone stopped working so I can only use it as an answering machine. The reason I ordered it online is that I am working in a remote area of Alaska; the only way I can get it fixed is to send it in, and wait 4-6 weeks (likely longer, with shipping here). So I can't return it til I leave the job. Not very useful. I am stuck using the answering machine and getting a duplex phone jack, so I can use an old-fashioned corded phone for my calls, one that I can find locally. Not very handy return policy, and does not suggest high quality parts. (I tried all the problem-solving instructions and called their customer service, but it's all automated, \and that didn't help.)"
1,"Cuts off people leaving messages, and you can't hear them!","I bought one of these and bought my Mom one; they both have the same problems. When playing messages that people left, you strain to hear them, even with the volume turned up to the max. It also cuts people off if they aren't talking loud enough. Was this phone designed by someone WHO TALKS REALLY LOUD ALL THE TIME?"
2,Distorted Sound,"First, I'd like to point out that the description stated here is incorrect. THIS PHONE DOES NOT HAVE SPEAKERPHONE CAPABILITIES AT ALL.Second, the phone sounds distorted. Even when you lower the volume it sounds weird.We ended up returning the phone."
4,excellent,"Though I was initially afraid to buy this so called cheap product. It turned out 2 be really good after my first call on it. It works really good, the clarity is also excellent. So is the battery. It might not have additional features like those costly ones but serves the basic need perfectlyThis is an addition for my review from four years ago. So guys, four years since we started using this phone ( correction: We don't just USE it, we abUSE it), it still works great. The battery is also great even now."
1,Do not buy this phone!,"I bought this phone a year ago (Jan 08) and it recently died on me. It kept giving me the ""low battery"" indicator, even if I only talked for 5 minutes. I would replace the battery, but just decided the chuck the whole phone since a phone battery costs $15.00 (half the price of the phone). I've own three cordless phones in the last twelve years, and this is by far the worst."
4,Great Basic Phone,"I have basic phone service. No caller ID, call waiting, etc. I just wanted a cordless phone with an answering machine. So I haven't used the caller ID features. This phone has been great for me. The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is that it's easy to accidentally hang up while multi-tasking and holding the phone on your shoulder. The button is right near your cheek. If you're careful though, this should be fine. I wouldn't consider it a reason to not buy the phone."
3,OK for the price.,"I can't really complain too much since it was a cheap phone.The clarity of a more expensive phone is missing, but it's justan extension for the kitchen, nothing too demanding.Basically, it's disposable."
4,C'est tres bon,"I have found the Traveller's French course fantastic. I had absolutely no French when I started and now after only 5 weeks feel very confident that I will be able to ask directions, order food and be generally polite when I travel this month. I have found that just listening to the tapes was great for pronounciation but a little bit of writing out the phrases was needed to lock them into my memory. This will not be reqired for most people though. The pocket phrase book is also going to be very handy and is a great size too. Overall very pleased with my purchase."
3,French Course,This language course is helpful in learning basic words to help with travel. Some of the courses tend to teach you words you would never use in your travels.
4,Battle Angel Alita,"Battle Angel Alita wastes no time setting up the disturbing visual and psychological tones the book will carry. It starts out in a massive junkyard in which a prosthetic doctor, Daisuke Ido, is searching for parts discarding from the floating city above. In the wreckage he finds the remains of an amnesic cyborg which he names Alita.Battle Angel Alita is set in a world where nothing is what it seems. The dirty post-apocalyptic setting gives the writer the ability to play with the hidden and dark nature of the world.The author, Yukito Kishiro, also does a great job blending science fact with science fiction using real functions of the human body with a blend of futuristic technology to explain some of the properties of Alita's robot body.It's a terrific and exciting beginning for a series and I'd give it a 9/10."
5,ghost in the shell,this book just plain out ROCKED! The animation was great and story was very gripping but confusing if you haven't seen the movie. i would reccomend it to all anime fans
5,One of the BEST: MANGA in all it's glory,"After being literally resurrected by Professor Daisuke, Alita (Gally) discovers there is more to her than there seems to be. She seems to have fighting abilities unknown to her, but that arrive at all the right times. The story line is beautiful and the art is just as good. If you already read MANGA or are just a beginner, this is the best series to begin with. Battle Angel Alita will keep you wanting more after each book, one of the best series out. A MUST!!"
5,Great Manga!,"This is a great book and the art work is beutifull,i hope to aquire the whole series!The characters have such depth,the story is original,this is a must read."
4,Battle Angel,This book is so so. When I bought this book I expected something that would blow me away. The story was kinda slow starting and kinda dull. The artwork is very well done at most points in the book. The ending was sorta confusing. This book was pretty much in between good and bad.
3,Another Cyborg Girl,"I couldn't find anything spectacular about this series. The story is very hackneyed (amnesia, special fighting abilities, loses first fight but comes back stronger, on a quest to discover self), and the artwork is... well, it's Manga. Comparing one manga book to another is not unlike trying to find differences between Everclear's songs. Sure, the panels flowed smoothly and the art is clean... but again, nothing special.If you're into manga, you might enjoy this. However, if you're getting sick of the genre, this will only make you sicker."
5,So Cute,I gave the Deluxe Doll Stroller to my Granddaugter for her 2nd birthday and she just loved it. Her mother put it together without any problem and it only took about 2 minutes. My Granddaugter and her little friend took turns pushing their dolls around all during the Birthday Pary.
4,Very informative.,"It's a very informative book, but it's best if you read The Satanic Bible before you read this one because this one is an addition to the philosophy laid out in The Satanic Bible."
5,Awesome!,"Comprehensive & direct, this is a useful companion to The Satanic Bible & The Satanic Verses.A staple of the system in which Dr. La Vey worked, it contains full ritual dialogue. This is an instructive framework for the dabbler in the occult."
3,Ritual Magic,"This book gives an overview of various rituals performed in the Church of Satan during its first few years of existence. Very little of substance is said however, unlike the author's other books. Of historical rather than practical value."
3,Personal Views Of Dr. LaVey,"A much more personal view of Dr. LaVey is revealed in this book. Although informative and amusing, it seems to lack the provocativeness that his previous titles had."
2,Did not like it.,This book was lacking in origionality and concept. The material was complacent and did not show a real direction. I think a cook book shows more assertivness than this book and I probably would have recieved more from it. The grade I give is a healthy one. Only read this book if you are really interested in satanism as a practice.
2,A Poor Effort,"... From one of tbe most important thinkers of the modern age! His predecessing Satanic Bible, and his succeeding Satan Speaks and the Devil's Notebook are by far - better. The one thing that irritates me is the crudely-translated/ partly-Anglicized Latin, French, and German ""rituals."" He should've gotten a better translator. Of course, I wasn't expecting him to be painting any scenes of raping virgins, killing animals, or all that hocus pocus in the B-movies, but anyhow, the work could've been done far more professionally."
5,Excellent for the practicing Satanist,"Lavey outdid himself when he wrote ""The Satanic Bible"", probably one of the most influential books I have ever read. Now, with ""The Satanic Rituals"", there are instructions on how to perform acts like the ""Messe Noir"" (Black Mass), and he gives interesting historical backgrounds as well. To all those idiotic Bible Bashers, here's some food for thought: If you stay loyal to the devil, there is no way of losing! If you end up in heaven, then you're IN ""PARADISE"" (I don't consider it that, because I would not like to eternally be ""god's"" servant). If you go to hell, then that's where you wanted to be in the first place! Maybe you should think about that when you go to your churches and worship your graven images and walk around wearing the symbol of your saviour's DEATH! AVE SATANAS! REGE SATANAS!"
3,???,"I am uncertain how to rate this book or speak on it except from the Book of Five Rings perspective. This would be the book ofTradition, or Air, in the Book of Unholy Virtues(if such a book existed, I mean). Lavey was not to be expected to make the pastrituals more exciting to the modern world. He shows us, however, what may have worked in the past to unlock the carnal desires of the flesh, but apparently not today."
4,"Not too useful, but intentionally so","The point of this book is provide IDEAS. LaVey has made it clear, both in this book and the rest of his writings, that a true Satanist will devise his/her own rituals and workings. This is just a mishmash of rituals from history and fiction that can provide the creative mind with fertile ground from which the REAL workings can spring. I was very disappointed in this book at first, until I understood its true purpose.Those who are looking for some magic ""formula"" that they can follow to achieve ""fortune"" or other such unimaginative dreams of success would probably be happier with Simon's ridiculous ""Necronomicon."" Or, alternatively, go join a Wiccan group and dance naked around a fire, wearing power crystals."
4,Good companion to the Satanic Bible,"This book isn't mainly concerned with the philosophy of Satanism- it's concerned with phycodrama that works. LaVey's main purpose in writing this was to give GROUPS small and large a definitive guide to ritualized magic. ... ceremonies and rituals are designed to free your mind, focus your skills, and some are for simple fun. I get the feeling this is like Haloween-type enjoyment; there is a level of vicariousness, and the knowledge that it is inheretly a drama on a grand scale, and yet it is accsessable even to beginer..."
2,Nowhere near as good as the first,"I was a big fan of the first 2 sections of the satanic bible, feeling that the last part (the part dealing more with magik) was contradictory to the rest of the book. Well, this whole book is like an expansion of the that last section, and contains none of the wit and charm of the first."
1,takes to long to send,to long of a wait for this product to ship. i am studying all books and need it as soon as possible
4,LA référence en matière de rituel satanique,The Satanic Rituals est le livre par excellence pour tout ceux qui ont déjà lu The Satanic Bible et qui veullent en connatre un peu plus sur les rituels sataniques.
3,Not One of Taibo's Best,"Hector Belascoaran Shayne is one of greatest characters in all of mystery fiction. The one eyed anarchist is at his very best when he is Mexico City. This is his home and he has wonderful eye for the absurdities of daily life in the world's largest city. However, problems begin when he leaves the D.F. for the frontera. Both Belascoaran Shayne and the book meander around both sides of the US-Mexico Border. The frontera is not Taibo's beat and unfortunately this is evident in the book. I would recommend this book only to die hard Taibo fans. For those new to Taibo, check out his earlier books."
5,A Must Have For Bobs Fans,"This is an awesome collection of great Bobs arrangements. If you are a lover of a capella singing, clever vocal arrangements and funny lyrics - you will love this CD. Simply outstanding."
3,"Funny, flawless acapella sounds","The bets of the bobs realy makes for an awesome collection of acapella music, both from studio recordings and live shows.While I don't agree with all the choices the editor made (where is psycho killer? that preformance from the first album was amazing!), most of the songs in this album make for a fun, light hearing."
4,FAR better than the Nikon Manual!,"This is sort of a ""Nikon 5700 for Dummies"" kind of book, and is FAR better than the confusing Nikon owners manual. Why is it that computer and camera manufacturers can rarely produce decent documentation, while others can make the same info clear?I found the physical quality of the book to be just fine. The CD included in the book will allow one to print the entire manual in color [.pdf file] if that's of interest, and also will allow one to print 14 pages of ""cheat sheets"" that GREATLY simplify the otherwise confusing array of dials and knobs and buttons and gizmos that allow one to access the potential in this great camera.I haven't tried the included software programs, but the manual is well worth the cost in helping a digital newbie climb the steep learning curve of this complex but capable camera. To fully utilize the potential of this camera, I will keep the book with the camera at all times."
1,Possibly the worst book of poetry ever...,"I love this book. When I read it, I start giggling uncontrollably. This book is bad, but bad in a way that -- before I read it -- seemed impossible. The badness is transcendent in that as you read it you go through stages: disbelief, more disbelief, confusion, hilarity, and then finally a mystical place of joy in the fact that such a astoundingly bad book exists and can be purchased. I leave you with a quote to begin your journey:Rocket shipsAre excitingBut so are rosesOn a birthdayComputers are excitingBut so is a sunsetAnd logicWill never replaceLove.Sometimes I wonderWhere I belongIn the futureOrIn the pastI guess I'm justAn old-fashionedSpaceman.Wow, just Wow."
4,matches from Wrestlefest 1992 not 1991,"first off, leif, before you do a review at least get the information correct.03/23/92 Shawn Michaels vs. Virgil04/07/92 Ted DiBiase & Irwin R. Schyster vs. The Bushwhackers03/10/92 Davey Boy Smith vs. Rick Martel1990s Highlights of various Bret Hart matches11/12/91 Bret Hart vs. The Barbarian03/10/92 The Nasty Boys vs. Earthquake & Typhoon04/08/92 Randy Savage vs. Irwin R. Schyster04/08/92 Tito Santana vs. Repo Man04/28/92 The Legion of Doom, Earthquake, & Typhoon vs. The Nasty Boys, Irwin R. Schyster, & Ted DiBiase"
3,Some good some bad,"There are moments in this video where you remind yourself why you boought it in the first place, hopefully used. Such as Warrior vs Earthquake, Greg Valentine vs Martel (surpisingly the best match I saw in years, Bulldog vs Haku, even Jannety vs Orient Express member form (MSG).Teh bad, well the fact that Savage hosts at home, which looks like a three bedroom pad, and I guess he wears his gimmick at home too. You see him drink Ice Tea (who cares?), lezuire in his living room (watching a 10 inch Tv (yeah right) and laying in the sun (with all his clothes on!)/ Oh by the way can't forget his pool tips, which he has to be the worst shot I've ever seen. Theres a barbershop segment where beefcake gives us tips, such as eggs and mud and man this is the stupidest thing I've ever seen. Some matches are terrible, Flair vs Dibiase and LOD vs the Foundation made me sick, but its still a good video."
4,Everybody needs a center to their universe- why not a chair?,"This is an unusual video. Frank Peretti has the ability to make you laugh and learn at the same time.Beginning from his chair at center stage Peretti begins to explore the universe. But the chair quickly fails him as a satisfactory reference by which to orient himself. And thus begins the search for an adequate and immovable point of reference.A wonderful Christian apologetic, presented at a level that anyone can understand, and in a way one is not likely to soon forget."
3,The title is misleading,"A rewarding half hour with J S Bach, but the title is misleading. Bach's years of service as a musical director in the Lutheran churches of Leipzig are not emphasized. What is emphasized, and done very well, is to show Bach's great musicianship in composing the the Brandenburg Concertos (specifically #5). This hardly does justice to the title, ""Serving God Through Music"", where one would expect illustrative examples of Bach's cantatas as well as excerpts of his St. Matthew and St. John Passions and the Mass in B Minor."
5,An amazing mix of emotional responses,"Well, first of all I disagree with the Kirkus review. I have read (and loved) Garcia Marquez, but I am growing to like Bernieres just as much. The responses about this book (and about Corelli's Mandolin) provoking loud bits of laughing and crying are true -- I kept my wife up half the night by laughing out loud when she was trying to sleep and had to make a hasty exit out of Kentucky Fried Chicken when I was moved to sudden tears."
4,A delightful and sobering equitorial romp,"Any critic who finds this novel ""boring"" must find life boring, because that's what this book is about: life--at least life lived in much of the two-thirds world, i.e., in oppressive third-world regimes. That de Bernieres can serve up this slice of life as funny and tender--as well as tragic and horrific--is testimony to how much more imaginative he is than the critic who finds this novel ""boring."" (Yes, there are flaws, duly noted by other readers, which is why I only give it 4 stars, as opposed to de Bernieres' 5-star masterpiece Corelli's Mandolin.)"
2,Overrated,"I went off this book as I read it. Magic realism by numbers. It has a initially brilliant surface that can't fail to disguise its empty sentimental heart. Don't bother, skip straight to One Hundred Years of Solitude."
2,Am I alone?,"Wow, as I read the other reviews I wondered if I had read the same book. Having come to Bernieres through Corelli - which I loved (and again that puts me at odds with many others), I had high hopes for this book, but I thought it overdone and contrived. Maybe I was in the wrong mood? Whereas Corelli had kept me entranced, with smooth easy flowing prose simply wafting me from page to page, Don Emmanuel just grated on me. Corelli was made into an awful movie. I suspect someone will make a movie of Don Emmanuel too, and I'd probably enjoy it - as a flimsy distraction. But the book didn't do it for me."
1,Don't waste your money,"This book was a keen disappointment. Although you can see the seeds of a good writer here (culminating in Correlli's Mandolin), this book is a mess. The characters are difficult to remember, and none of them elicit the least bit of sympathy. The fact that the author kills them off or subjects them to graphic torture doesn't help. As for plot, good luck. I kept hoping for some redeeming scene or resolution, but nothing arose. I sold this book to a used book store to retrieve something of merit from my waste of time. I only feel bad for the next unsuspecting reader...."
4,A Great Purchase,"I recieved my camera in two days, complete with instructions, accessories and new packaging. The picture quality aint bad either. I brought straight from amazon.com (be cautious of all vendors) For $13.01, It was a Great purchase."
2,Useless,"My wife purchased this camera at the Visitor's Center Gift Shop in Philidelphia. It came with a cable for PC interfacing but no instructions. Our PCs see the camera as an ""Unknown USB 1.1"" device but that's it. Searching Internet found no device driver or product support. Consulting with the retailer was less than helpful (""We sell lots of these and no one else has complained.""). Don't buy one!"
3,This version is cut up!,This is actually the edited version of Shopping. I taped an uncut version off of a network here in Canada called Show Case that runs unknown smaller films like this. I also own this DVD and thats how I know this DVD is edited. My taped movies run time is about 1 hour and 42 minutes (102 min). This DVD is only 89 minutes. The uncut version is a bit better as a couple of key scenes were left out of this DVD.
5,"Cars, music, theft... Youth isn't wasted on the young...","There are few things in life that would be better than driving around in the fastest and best engineered automobiles Europe has to offer. Among those better things are not caring about the damages to these automobiles and getting all kinds of free stuff in the process. Since I'd rather not spend the rest of my life in a cage or in a ceader box, this is the closest I'm gonna get. Phenominal."
4,A tasty tonic compared to the dearth of Hollywood tripe,"This film understands something that 99% of Hollywood films dont. Its the journey not the destination that matters. Most films are like inanimate objects these days, skeletal building frames carefully joined together to get to the pre-determined and cliched ending. Boring. Most Hollywood movies make me want to shoot myself in the head they're so trite.If you breathe life into the characters, setting, and film itself you dont need a destination, you dont need black and white. Everything speaks for itself.Thats why theres so much hostility towards this film, it doesnt fit in a box.The hero is an immoral thief, yet his humanity shines through and you cant help but like him. This film is reminscent of Menace II Society in the way you excuse the criminals to some degree for their crimes.I deduct a point because the film is a bit glossy and the characters sexed up a bit for the screen.Great film for those who dont need to be spoonfed."
1,*Yaaaaaaawn*,"For a flick which is chock-full of car crashes, cop-fleeing, and massive explosions, damn, this is surprisingly boring. Jude Law is fine with what he's given to work with, but most of the other actors--Sean Pertwee, Sean Bean, and an achingly young, gangly Jason Isaacs--are completely wasted in this silly movie."
4,Great catharsis movie...,"Wow, I love this flic. This movie has a different feel to it, being made in England probably explains it. The setting reminds me of the Crow, a nice dark world where the younger people dress like later 80's post New Wave people. The techno sound track plays nicely into the intensity of high speed car chases. I watch the character steal nice cars and crash them into nice stores to steal a couple simple items and run off off while being chased by cops. There is something in this movie that really addresses something the early 20's age group have to deal with, finding a reason to grow up. A Great flic..."
3,Good but not great...,"This film about big city boredom could have been written about any young people in any industrialized nation in the world. Jude Law plays an angst ridden young man, recently out of jail, dogged by bad decisions, an embarrassment to his family, who chooses the thrill of stealing cars and crashing them into shopping malls to ""shop"" as a way to add a missing something to his life. He's at odds with a gang of vicious thugs that are bent on his destruction. The film is well done for the most part, but it feels like there's something missing - some critical piece just around the corner, hovering just out of sight - that will make it all come together. Jude Law does well, but even then it's only good, not great."
5,Great find.,"I had a copy of this once, but gave it away, and then had reason to want one again, so was happy to find it."
1,ON THE [TOILET],"THATS WHERE YOU SHOULD WATCH THIS VIDEO FROM. IT IS A SET-UP.THE VIDEO HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH KEROUAC. IT IS ABOUTFRANCO-AMERICANS AND LOWELL, MASS. HE MAKES A MINUTE'S WORTH OFAPPEARANCES SPEAKING IN A FRENCH INTERVIEW WITH SUBTITLES...I BOUGHT IT AS A GIFT AND IT WAS TERRIBLE..."
5,holy buckets!,"If you have never experienced Kerouac, this is the place to start. From begining to end this film yields exclusive insight into the unknown world of the beat generation. For avid beat and or Kerouac lovers you will see scenes that will shock, make you laugh, make you cry and even want to sell your home to roam the countryside without a penny to your name. A must add to your beat collection/"
2,"Poor Follow Up to ""First Love and Other Sorrows""","I'm reminded of the Native American character in the Jim Jarsmuch movie, ""Dead Man"" whose name is something along the lines of ""He who talks alot but says very little.""I read First Love and Other Sorrows before this and was outraged that more people hadn't heard of this guy. Brodkey was around 25 or 26 when that first collection was published and sadly he hadn't learned much in the 20 or 30 intervening years. Except how to overwrite.Can't remember the title but there was one story about a guy trying to give a woman an orgasm that may have the most mechanical and unintentionally funny descriptions of sex this side of Norman Mailer.A weird combo of Updike and Mailer at their pompous ""great writer"" worst.Even so, even bad Brodkey has its moments."
4,I love it but sometimes full of cons,"Cons:The game is great, butI hate it when dogs or cats run away! It makes me feel bad and petz should NOT run away! Also the spay/neuter stuff stinks! It is no fun for mom dogs to stay in the nursery. And this annoying ""you already have 20 pets"" thing at the adoption center is EVIL!Pros:The game is so cool traveling to different playscenes!The clothes are so cute and when the dogs/cats fall in love it is so sweet! The toyz are awesome and the different breedz are cool.I reccomend this game BUT the runaway thing is trash!"
5,"My kids say "" 2 Thumbs Up""","I got this game for my 2 girls (ages 6 & 3 ) and they really love this game. They're always telling me what new things they did with their ""Petz"". One thing they really like is taking a picture (with you own camera) and then loading it to the game and using it as a ""playscene"".They've got their Petz playing in their room, at the Indianapolis Zoo, outside in the snow, etc.we haven't experienced any problems with the game. overall, a great game."
4,Fun for all ages!,"It's a real fun game for my 12 year old and my 4 year old. They can have as many virtual pets as they want and they love choosing between cats and dogs. Several months after first playing it they're still finding new surprises and enjoying watching their pets learn and change. Every once in a while the game crashes though... I've yet to discover why, though. It never happens when I'm watching and the kids can't seem to tell me what they were doing with the game at the time it crashes so trouble-shooting it has been tricky where that's concerned. Could be a game glitch, could be something my kids are doing (too many pets moving around at once or something?). But in all this game's worth the price. Loads of fun."
4,Great but....,"I think Petz is great, but there is One problemo. My dad has PC, ok big woop. But I can only use PEtz on a PC! Since my parnets are divorced they live sperately, meaning that my mom has a macintosh computer! I live with my mom most of the time, so I dont get to play PEtz for most of the week. So i say, that Petz, as well as, Dogz, Catz, and Babyz be compatible with macintosh computers."
1,Just plain stupid,"The graphics are horrible. The usability is junk. I am not even sure what you are supposed to do. Pet a cat on the computer until its happy or something? I got this for my young daughter. I guess it would please her more if the graphics were of this millinium and there were better ""kid"" controls. If you are an adult that plays and loves this game, you probably where big sweat shirts with airbrushed cats on the front."
5,Purrrrrrrrrrfect!,"This game is really entertaining. The ""voices"" of the cats and dogs on the computer are simply realistic; and there is no need for a pooper-scooper! The best thing is, you can take care of your pet, leave on a vacation for a few days, start up the program, and the game will not go on without you! And better yet, there is no allergy, or cat fur, or smelly doggy breath aorund the house. Really well done. My daughter loves it."
3,Catz 5 / Dogz 5,"hello!Catz 5, in my opinion, is a delightful and fun game. Why? Well, this game has all the joys of owning real cats and dogs, and you can have as many as you want, and not have to worry about messes on your carpet or hairballs on the floor. The graphics in the game are unique, and have a sort of ""Cartoony"" feel to them.The reason I gave this game such a low rating is that there are many, many glitches in the program.For example, sometimes when your cat has a litter the game crashes because the computer cannot take the new files of the kittens. Many times, I've had to re-install the game because it said it could not load the files. The sounds sometimes give out, so no vocalizations come from the cats or dogs. Ubi Soft has not taken time to create a patch for this problem.I would reccomend this game for ages 8-100"
5,Haters Are Idiots,"Hey, this is a great game. Just to tell the people who think this gaame is boring: Y'all must not be able to use a computer if you think there's nothing to do. Sure, this is a few-minutes-each-day game. But you can dress up your pets, you can breed them, (though I'm not sure about the crashing problem, I only had that with the fourth game installment) and you can use programs to make new breeds. For people who can't get any items, that's done with theminigames. And though you get bored after a half-hour to an hour, you go back to it the next day."
1,"This Prodiuct Does not Work, It is showing a ghost dog and child completely disappointed for XMAS.","This is software that does not work. The child was so looking forward to it, but useless waste of $$ to buy this."
5,Pretty good,"Looked into trance for a while and this is pretty decent stuff, not to slow and soft like most of the trance out..."
5,Passages by Gail Sheehy,"This book was purchased for my 28-year-old daughter. She and I were visiting and discussing ""life"" issues and I got out my copy of Passages, copyright 1977, that I had purchased many years ago at a used book store when she was just a toddler. She was so surprised at how many of the marked passages in my book that she identified with that she knew she had to have a copy of her own. A book that identifies life situations across the generations is a book well worth having. I'm so glad you are still making it available to a new generation. Some things never change ...."
3,It took me years to read this,"I'm not kidding, and it's been a standing joke in the family that I've taken this book with me on dozens of vacations and never finished it. I don't know why it's considered such a classic of women's wisdom, except that when it was written, nothing like it existed. I found some interesting insights, but none of the profound, earth-shaking rattles to my consciousness that I was led to expect. It is an interesting and worthwhile book for anyone experiencing major changes in life that can't be explained by a troubled marriage, kids who are driving them crazy, or a job that's evaporating with age or lack of enthusiasm. Try it, but don't expect to be bowled over."
5,A Must Read,This book is in the top five of my favorites. It helped me understand different stages of life and what to expect as we age and mature. I read it for the first time in my 30's and now in my 50's I'm reading it again and still picking up new nuggets of valuable information. This book should be mandatory reading for every woman.
4,Interesting analysis of stages of development,"I enjoyed reading his book now, even though some of the book seems dated, as it was writen in the 70's, but much of it still holds true. The author talks about each decade of life having its own problems of identity and how one goes through the trying 20's, the 30's, and up to a mid-life crises in the forties.I had never read a book that broke down human development into stages, so I thought it was interesting how the author describes that everyone goes through changes throught all the decades in general.This book was a little long, but I enjoyed it. I especailly enjoyed chapters 17 and 25."
1,boring,"hard to keep your attention, too full of boring clinical details, i was hoping for something more along the lines of a life story but ended up skipping through the book thinking maybe it would get better later on but nope."
2,And the answer is?,"I purchased this workbook as a companion to the McDougal Littell Language Network set. It covers a lot of various activities and follows the text book beautifully...just one problem; there's no answer key. For the basic skills this isn't too much of a problem but when it comes to diagramming complex sentences and some of the punctuation assignments, a key is essential."
3,So far (first couple of chapters) it's only okay,Book was in condition as stated. But it's only okay for now. I actually haven't kept reading on because the content hasn't really interested or engaged me. But we'll see if it changes in the following chapters.
4,Windsor Jr. High-Kyle W.,"This book is a classic. While it didn't meet all of my expectations, it was still a very good book. It was researched excellently, down to every detail. Crossley-Holland carried on the series in a way that kept me hooked throughout the entire book."
5,Como de verdad es FACILITO aprender,"con este libro, mi esposa lo utiliza PARA NUESTROS NIÑOS ...y da muy buenos resultados...Ya me piden dinero en inglès,..jiji"
1,Trek canvas tent 10x14,"Ok, got my tent on 10/15/12, was very excited, first canvas tent for me, set it up in my backyard, to see if everything there etc, and immidiatly had to go find my tape messure, it is actually a lot a lot smaller then on the pics, actual size is 13.5'x 9.5', the feel of the fabric is very thin and cheap, the pegs are very small and cheap looking, I got better ones with my $120 tent, the fly is ultra thin material-$80 bucks extra, the whole frame does not attach to the ground in any way, I just think it ll stay put in the wind, only edges of the tent have loops to secure it to the ground, imo not near enough . Very disappointed, wish I saved my money and bought a better tent later, Do Not Recommend."
2,Binding fail,"I bought the book ""Bride of Deimos vol. 2"" and the description was ""like new"" but the moment I opened the book, the whole cover, back cover and binding fell apart."
3,"history, yes. teaching, a little, practice a little less","Not a bad book for someone experienced in Iai, definitely a dry read. The photos and descriptions of technique are somewhat vague and generally un-helpful unless you've seen it in real life before. If I had picked it up in a bookstore I'd flip through it and then put it back. It is still a good, well written book and a good addition to the library of the sword enthusiast just don't expect to beat any samurai after reading it."
2,I'll keep this short...,"The tale of the ""Sharon"" is an interesting one, indeed. Ms. Druett is a knowledgable historian, and perhaps a very fine text book author. However, this particular book is disjointed. It is extremely frustrating to the reader when one of the main principals in this storyis ""never to be heard from again"" WHAT? after two hundred pages, I would have liked at least some rumors of his fate. Another dies an early death, time and place noted, but NO CAUSE of death. AARRGGGHHH. Also distracting are the continual references to Herman Melville, who was neither present, nor directly involved with the story at all. In all, the story could be interesting, and I hope someone else will take it up, because I felt somewhat cheated."
2,Her writing is irritating - subject is interesting,"The book very frequently uses a very irritating grammer style (at least to me) - the use of the Conditional Perfect and Conditional Perfect Progressive verb tenses - ""he would have heard"", ""Norris would have looked back"", ""he would have been formally dressed"", ""he would have been well aware"", etc and much more etc. Another issue I have with the writing style is the author's leaping to conclusions with hardly any information to support the leap - e.g. critizing the Captain's use of ""full canvas"" to get to the whaling grounds when the ship's log makes no mention of bad weather or sailing problems. I'm only 50 pages into the book and reading it is heavy weather."
3,Not bad,"Though it's not a bad read it was not what I hoped for. The book starts off good, the history of the people involved and the story up to the mutiny is pretty good. The mutiny itself, though vicious, was not what the title suggest. ""The bloodiest mutiny"" it said, not quite. There were books like Batavia's Graveyard that had more violent and brutal mutinies. The events after the mutiny get a little drawn out. The second half of the book didn't keep me as interested and I was ready to move on to another book before I finished. I did finish it and would say it's a good read, I just expected a little more(judging from the title) than it offered. 3 1/2 stars is about right."
2,"good book, but flawed.","Gardner centers his attacks on what he terms ""psuedo science."" Having read the book carefully, I got the impression that Gardner would attack anything that doesn't fit the scientific paradigm. The scientific method he extolls is nothing more than a rehash of skepticism. In fact, all science can be reduced to skepticism. Skepticism is one of the oldest philosophical positions in the world. I strongly agree with skepticism as a method of investigation, however Gardner fails to realize that those he criticizes are also skeptical. Charles Fort for instance was skeptical of data that science ignores. Yet in this book Gardner criticizes him without mercy. This seems very odd. Gardner makes several good points on being doubtful of claims and to investigate them. On this I completely agree. However his use of skepticism is seriously biased. I recommend the reading of this book,but keep a skeptical mind on Gardners claims."
2,Kinda dated,"The book was a hard read, I think because it is so dated (1957). Most of the individuals mentioned in the book died many years ago. I had never heard of them and I am 64 years old. The extreme detail of each fad/fallacy didn't help either. Oh well, I shudda known. I threw the book away after reading it."
1,My last review was a joke,"This is a classic book really, I recommend it along with ""On the Wild Side,"" ""The New Age,"" and ""Weird Water & Fuzzy Logic"" by the same author."
4,Fads and Fallacies,"Martin Gardner's Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science still holds up as a (if not the) classic skepticism book. Examining everything from a rational perspective, Gardner skews what many still consider sacred (chiropractors, Scientology, etc.). A must for every library."
1,1952-2002 [IMPORT] Joe Tribute- Strummer,"This album was originally released as a Clash tribute. I own it as such. So what's happened here, is that Joe Strummer died and some scumbag(s) decided to try and cash in on that fact. That should be reason enough NOT to buy this. If you really want to pay tribute to Joe buy HIS albums and checkout: www.strummersite.com/A proper tribute will come out someday wait for that one!!Oh and to the person that never heard of the Business, they are a fairly well known brit streetpunk/oi band. Not bad but pretty one dimensional."
5,Easy Swap,The original trolling motor plug and socket on my 15 year old fishing boat was loose and overheating. This receptacle and plug fit the existing 1 3/8 inch hole perfectly and I was even able to install the trim bezel using the existing screws and holes. The wires on the boat and trolling motor connect with binding screws so there are no unsightly splices to corrode. The locking plug works great. I highly recommend this product.
1,Does Not Work. Do Not Buy.,"This product does not work, and the poorly written documents and difficult-to-use software do not help. I tried everything, from upgrading the printer driver (to the latest XP-compatible version), to differnt length USB cables, to no avail. Avoid this turkey."
2,Not fully Mac compatible,"I am mainly complaining about the Advertized description. On the Cables Unlimited website it clearly states that this unit is compatible with Windows, 98se/2000/me/xp, Mac OS 10.0 or higher.For Mac it does not auto switch. You have to do it manually. It is not an auto switch as advertized in this case.If you want to use it between two PCs it should work just fine."
1,Really bad phone,"I bought this phone, and it's terrible, i couldn't hear with one of the handset, the main one, i wont buy a GE again."
4,no speakerphone option,This phone set works great - my only complaint is that there is no speakerphone option on the handsets.
1,Cheap phone.,This phone is low priced because it is low quality! I would never waste my money on this item again. Only one handset works at a time and most of the features are not user friendly! The sound quality is very poor too. Do not buy this phone!
1,IT SUX!,"I'VE BEEN USING THIS PHONE FOR ME BUSINESS AND FOR SOME REASON THE PHONE LOSE CONNECTION WITH THE STATION, ONE TIME THE PHONE WASN'T WORKING FOR 3 HOURS IN THE MORNING TILL I REALIZED THE PHONE HASN'T BEEN RINGING THE WHOLE MORNING. WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER GE PHONE AGAIN."
4,Hello!,I have been a fan of Motorola for years. I liked the look of this and the price was right on for what you get. My only complaint is the address book only holds 10 phone numbers. The hand set holds another 10 so you've got 20 total if you can remember which phone has which numbers. Other than that it performs well with the other features. The ring is somewhat annoying but it does get your attention. Luckily I have a cell phone(Motorola) with all the numbers I need.
2,unsatisfactory,"Would not buy this phone again, reception is poor and overall quality isnot very good"
3,2nd Phone Charger Buzzes,"These phones are exactly what I was looking for -- dual handset, answering machine, caller ID. They work just fine and we have had no problems with the phones. My only complaint is that the charger buzzes when plugged in, and is very annoying. I tend to plug it in at night and unplug it when I'm in the same room."
2,poor sound quality,"HAd the phone for 2 weeks prior to returning it. Worked as advertized, but the past reviewer who commented on the loud tone of your own voice was right on. When you speak into the phone, your voice shouts into your ear. The only way to comfortably speak into the phone was to hold the mouthpiece well away from your mouth. Also lacks a speakerphone (which many in this price range have)."
4,cordless phone,phones are great for the price. they are clear and work great and are easy to program and set up as well. there is no speaker phone on it for those who enjoy the speaker phone feature. all in all phones are great for the price.
4,A great phone!,"This phone is great! It holds a good charge, I can hear clearly and everything! The only thing that could be better is the answering machine. I like the ""delete all"" option when it comes to messages (especially when I have 25) but instead you have to go through each one and delete. Other than that, great phone!"
4,Great Book for Fawlty Tower Geeks,Everything you ever wanted to know about Fawlty Towers and then some!! Provides quite an insight into the production of what many consider to be the best television comedy produced to date. I enjoyed it tremendously and I hope you enjoy it too.
3,Los Indos Tabajaras,Had an album by them in the 70's and it was great. This one was a little disappointing. But OK.
1,"Don't bother...should be called ""Bolero""","I had to write a review of this because it was so disappointing. It's 30 minutes and it only talks about Bolero even though it is supposed to be about his whole life. They talk about how depressing it was that Bolero was his most famous piece, yet they ONLY talk about Bolero and play that one composition during the whole episode. They say how he shouldn't be known for just this one piece, but then only talk about it. They say how Ravel was depressed about this fact yet only they only talk about Bolero. This could have been written by an elementary school student. Don't bother!"
4,Gandalf wig,Bought two of these wigs and created full Gandalf beard. The quality is not excellent but given the amount of money paid it was worth the price. It ended up having some educational value because I showed others how to create a beard by cutting up a wig. Would not be good for younger kids - definitely for teens through adults.
5,awesome wig for 13 yo,Needed this for son who played a Merlin in school play-did NOT want to spend too much...this wig was Perfect!!! Note-must be held on by bobby pins as not much elastic but this was no problem...was total hit and director loved it!!!
1,"ok for the price, doesn't play ipod videos","It's ok for the price i paid 150 but seems like cheaper stereo, buttons looks cheap, screen have just 2 color when you play something that's not dvd and you could not change images.The description says that play ipod videos with the cable, and appear on the display the name of the song, the only thing that appears is a blue screen with sound.Positivessounds good.good dvd quality."
1,Don't buy this!!!,Stay away from this item!The materials were of cheap plastic.Didn't work correctly from the beginning. The video never worked.Within 3 mos my CD's start skipping! Those were brand new cd's that works on all other radios!Had a horrible time returning it to Amazon.Do not buy this! You'll regret it!
1,a remix cd of old stuff,"ok...this cd is mix of old lil jon joints and some remixes. as a lil jon fan, i was very disappointed. here is what you should do;wait for the Part II cd to come out later this year, just keep enjoying the Kings of Crunks and all the cameos lil jon has out.onelove"
3,Good album,"Most of it was okay. But the two stand out tracks are P***y N***A f/ Hitman Sammy Sam, 504 Boyz, and Da Jump Off f/Killer Mike, 404 Soldierz. The biggest suprise is that hitman sammy sam uses P***y N***a to diss Pastor Troy. The vere goes like I'm a georgia boy f**k Pastor Troy. Good crunk album worth checking it out."
1,Not New Material,"Okay, this cd just came out right? Well then, why is the first track old? Why does Ludacris have a light voice? Is it because this is just junk they're trying to put out because they figure they're on a roll? Uh, yeah. If you got this, you know what I mean, and if you haven't don't pick it up. It doesn't sound anything like the real crunkness. Whoever certified this crunk must think 50 cent is god because I would sell this cd to anyone who wanted it for 50 cents. Garbage. Even the cover is dull. The eastside boys aren't even fat and lil jon doesn't have his expensive glasses or that annoying wine cup. Do yourself a favor and let this album flop. Lil Jon could use a reality check, especially after that sick youngbloodz cut."
3,looks kinda dumb,i dont have dis album yet either but i dont really care.dis looks stupid but i probably will buy it becase im tryin to get all da lil jon cds but right now im tryin to get we still crunk!
3,An average expansion that's essentially been phased out,"This was a decent expansion to the highly addictive Civ4 release but as of the release ofSid Meiers Civilization IV Beyond the Swordthe Warlords Expansion pack is really moot. Now, if price is a factor, you do pay less for the Warlords expansion but the Beyond the Sword expansion not only retains the Warlords features, it adds tons and tons of new material. Yes, 2K games should have just skipped Warlords but they didn't and to those of us who bought both Warlords and Beyond the Sword, most of us may be a bit peeved. Alas, that is the nature of the computer gaming industry."
3,"It's decent, not great...","If you like Civilization like I do then you'd probabally buy any expansion pack. And if you are I wouldn't suggest skipping this one, it does at some content, but if you aren't a hardcore Civilization gamer, I'd go ahead and skip it. The scenarios are okay, but after you've played most of them once you won't want to go back and do it again. (The only exception might be the Chinese Unificiation, in which you might want to try a few of the Chinese States). And it adds very little to the actual core game, just a few civilizations, unique buildings, and a very buggy vassal system. Again, if you are a big fan of civilization, then go ahead and get it, if you're a casual civver, then skip it."
3,"Good little sparks, but nothing THAT innovative","Although after buying this expansion, the Ottoman's have become my new favorite tech, the expansion overall doesnt add much. Vasssal state feature is cool, but hard to attain, and pointless most of the time. I do have to say that my favorite new feature is the special buildings - I think it adds an excellent new strategy to choice of civ.If you are crazy about civ 4, then definitely get this expansion, but if your just an occasional player, then you'd be fine just sticking with the base civ, and using the $30 getting an extra tank of gas instead."
4,Civ IV to the enth degree,"Better graphics, bigger action, and great generals and leaders and cool special buildings for your Civ!"
4,A very good game gets a little better,"The best part about this expansion pack is the scenarios. Having played them all, I can say that they generally are fun, although a couple of them (like the Settling of America) fall flat. Most fun is either the Genghis Khan scenario or Barbarians. The Warlord unit is useful, but perhaps not as powerful as i would have expected. Overall, a good buy."
5,Challenging Game at a Great Price,I have been playing all the versions of Sid Meier's Civilization for years. This is a good Expansion Pack for Civilization IV.
4,Fun to Play,"When I want to escape from reading, writing, and work in general I play Civ IV. This expansion pack is a great way to waste an afternoon."
3,Too few good additions,"While the base game was great, the first expansion pack left most people wanting more than we got with Warlords. Don't get me wrong, there are some good elements that were added with Warlords, just too few for some people.Vassal states were really the big thing that was added with Warlords. There are the other things, like new leaders, AI personalities, new civs to play, and scenarios, but that's pretty much it.With the second expansion due out in July of 2007, many people are suggesting that people wait for the full feature list to see if the big features from Warlords are added or not. I can understand that thinking, but there isn't anything BAD about Warlords, and some mods require it.So, buy it if you want, because it does add a bit to the game, but don't feel like it's a HUGE upgrade. Vassal states really do add a bit to the game that make me happy I bought it. Beyond the Sword(expansion 2) will have so much more included, you may want to wait."
4,"Like the Civ 3 Expansions, good but expensive","The expansion pack adds great generals, which allow you to make some really super units (that don't lose experience when you upgrade them). It adds some scenarios (I don't play those, so I have no idea how good they are). It adds some civilization traits that are mostly fighting-based. It adds some new civilizations, which aren't exactly earth-shattering.If you play scenarios, you might find this worth the money. If you only play the main game, get this if you're a HUGE Civ fan. If you can wait, wait for the inevitale price drop."
5,Great book,This was a fun book to read. To see someone's life change so dramatically was encouraging and so different from what most contemporary fiction is about.
5,Sweet and clean--a rare thing these days!,"Books by Grace Livingston Hill: they're sweet and old-fashioned, and you are not going to find dirt in them, except maybe where somebody is converting an ugly piece of ground into a garden. If there is evil, it always gets its comeuppance, so you don't have to be afraid to give them to your young daughter to read. There's always a Christian witness, and many times a junky little house or room gets a makeover, to become a thing of beauty, and you get the details on how it was done, often without spending much money. Also, sometimes there's a makeover of a plain girl into a real beauty. Love almost anything by this author! I collect every one I can get my hands on, and read and re-read it again and again."
4,Nerilka,"This is an okay book by my all time favorite author. Nerilka, is kind of boring, and most of the bok was already covered in Moreta. I really didn't like the ending though. Nerilka (this story is told from her point of veiw) was comparing herself to Alessan's 1st wife and to Moreta, and somehow found that she was beter than them! Bottom line: Great if read with the other Dragonriders books, but doesn't stand well alone."
2,"Good, but not her best work","I love McCaffery's Pern series, but I was just a little disappointed with Nerilka. Perhaps I'm just a romantic at heart, but Nerilka's ""romance"" with Alessan seemed a little more 13th century Earth than that between, say, F'lar and Lessa in ""Dragonflight"". The first person perspective doesn't really add all that much. The material that isn't covered in ""Moreta"" doesn't really add much. To the book's credit, however, it gave very nice insights into how the ""common"" folk lived, and how they saw the holders and the dragonriders."
2,"OK, only because of Pern","Any book about Pern is worth reading, because there may be at least a snippit of dragons in them. This book had very little. Any author can write stories about unappreciated younger daughters. Nobody writes about dragons like Anne McCaffery. I wish she would spend more time doing it!..."
2,Disappointed,"I've loved the books I've read so far in the Dragonriders series, with the exception of Nerilka.1) I read this book right after reading Moreta and found it too repetitive. This story may have been better intertwined as part of Moreta.2) I didn't like the ending to Moreta and this book was too much of a reminder of that ending.Perhaps leaving some time between reading the Moreta and Nerilka books it would make Nerilka more enjoyable."
3,"Good story, but seemingly written for children","I have enjoyed all of Anne McCaffrey's books, especially the crystal singer series, and although i did enjoy this book i found the style to be that of a childrens' book, the edition i had even had illistrations, how cute! I think Ms. McCaffrey may have been under pressure to produce more Dragonriders of Pern books and got this one out as quickly as possible. Good book to buy for your young relatives, nieces and daughters should be your target."
4,a very sweet first-person story of love and tragedy,"I very much enjoyed this story. I've read all of Anne McCaffrey's stories of the Dragonriders of Pern and this is the first one I felt was a proper perspective of life during the great plague that nearly wiped out all of Pern. Nerilka was a very believable character and I feel very sympathetic toward her and her tragedy of losing her family, and her joy at finding love with the lord holder. However, the book was too short for me to enjoy fully. I would have liked to have seen more done with her."
1,Really disappointing,"I ordered this book eager to learn more about an aesthetic that I personally subscribe to and practice with my art. While I resonated with the introductory pages, once getting into the heart of its text I have been severely disappointed. In fact, I just can't even read it. I wish I could send it back and demand a refund. The author's discussion reads more like the typical home magazine articles that target women yearning for crafty ways to live. But what finally stopped my perusal looking for something more substantive was when she started describing how to fold laundry or hang the toilet paper roll--! Please. BTW, I am a middle-aged woman, so know that I am not dumping on that segment. It's just that this book is really a disappointment--and a testament to why buying books at your local independent bookseller, where you can pick them up and scan the inside before spending hard-won money on them, is the best bet."
5,An essentially accurate and sympathetic book,"This is an essentially accurate and sympathetic book. Chafets for many years was a journalist at the 'Jerusalem Report' and followed what was happening in Israel very closely. He before that served as an Advisor to Prime Minister Begin. He is a writer who makes an effort to meet with people from all walks of life, escape the common cliches of the media, and provide his own special perspective.He provides an interesting look at Israeli society as it appeared nearly two decades ago."
5,Music Man,As the Old CD's go out of print you should be snagging as many of them as you can afford. MP3's are taking over the music world and new CD's are going to be as hard to find as Old Vinyl!
4,4ft [really] good!,"I first heard of 4ft fingers about 2 yrs ago. Then i saw them live at a local skate fest. They kicked [tail]! Definately the highlight of my day! Ive just come back from a gig of theirs at a local bar-again, they were excellent. I recomend this cd to any punk fan, 4ft fingers got something for everyone. And if you do not get this cd, see them live! and if you dont see them live, then your missing out! Fast paced, sing-a-long, melodic, angry/happy kick [behind] punk rock, check them out!!!!!"
4,Biggest prision break EVER!,"This was a one-shot OVA by produced Production IG(Ghost In The Shell), and created by Gainax who did FLCL and Gurren Lagann. This was an original anime not based on any manga.Taking place in the distant future, two amensiac fugitives find themselves in the middle of the desert. After a quick crime spree, they're caught and sentenced to a prision on what's left of the moon. Once there, they team up with the other inmates to do the ultimate prision break. This leads to some amazingly cartoonish fight scenes. It's literally like a cross between Tom & Jerry and Quinton Tarentino. It leads up to a big battle, an immature pregnancy, and lots of explosions and violence.A censored version of Dead Leaves has been featured on Sci-Fi Channel's Ani-Monday, and a few other cable TV showings. It's a great sci-fi anime with quirky character designs, over-the-top action, and some serious reality-challenging physics!"
4,Great flick!,"This is such a great anime! If you like spazzy FLCL stuff, then you will LOVE this! I loved the dvd, but I gave it 4 stars ONLY because I had to buy it twice! I bought it first from Newbury comics, and had to send it back because it was the sadistic weirdo flick Dead Leaves by Constantin Werner, NOT the ANIME!!! So I bought it again from Caiman, and I got what I had ordered."
2,Migraine inducing gore fest.,"I kept thinking the animation style of the credits and first few scenes was just some temporary effect that would fade to a more traditional style, but no - it stayed that way through the whole ""ride."" There are a few jokes, a few situations that induced a chuckle, but for the most part this is just an excuse to show dozens upon dozens of ""characters"" killed, maimed, mutilated, and pulverized in the most horrible of ways possible in the short hour or so that this lasts. Add in the toilet humor, the sodomy ""gags"" (one inmate has a powerful drill for his ""equipment"") and the shear volume of bloodletting and you have what amounts to a basically pointless romp. They try to insert a point and a story with a unique poem that the two heros can barely remember as they are suffering from amnesia, but in the end nothing is really resolved - and you are left wondering what the point was. Would have given it a one, but I have to admit, it made me laugh a couple of times."
3,EVER WONDER WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF SAM PECKINPAH DIRECTED AN ANIMATED FEATURE?,"Well, this is as close as you're going to get to it. DEAD LEAVES is truly the child of the Tarantino/Bruckheimer era, with Tarantino's violence and Bruckheimer's ""Let's blow up something"" attitude. At only an hour, there's no room for character development, which means no attempt at John Woo's action mixed with an understanding of the characters. They are what they are - characters who shoot, kill, blow stuff up, then move on to the next scene of carnage.I gave it three stars for the style - thick black lines and a dynamic mix of colors. It's a good ""park your brain at the door"" film, but ""Howl's Moving Castle"" it ain't. Obviously, the director wants you watch it, then turn on Metallica, down a six pack of Budweiser, then crush the cans against your head. Don't see it with a girl unless you want HER movie pick next time be ""The Devil Wears Prada""."
5,Stop reading this and go buy it! Now!,"I first stumbled upon dead leaves online and decided not to get it because it would mean spending twenty two bucks on an hour long film. I recently viewed it thanks to the magic of Tivo and now I must own it. One hour that will start out interesting, suddenly turn awesome, more awesome, and never stops. Best comparison would be the FLCL, Jet Set Radio, and a dumpster of blood mixed together with a mutant sci-fi theme. Humor in all the worst forms, and at a pace that will keep you laughing till it hurts.Basically the most fun hour I have ever spent in front of a television. Parents may not agree but I think everyone should watch this. It is a blast!"
1,Headache Inducing,One of the worst animes I have ever seen which is a damn shame knowing it was made by Production I.G. They really need to get their act together. I mean the stuff they did in Kill Bill was amazing and the animation in Blood: The last Vampire was great but the story was so weak overall and it wasn't long enough. What is the deal? Also this is too short to waste your money on the purchase...It is only 50 minutes. Basically this is a poor stab at violent bonnie and clyde-ish pop/abstract art/anime that fails on a number of levels.
2,Wow this looks dumb,"Yeah, the amazon.com review just about encapsulated it. This is a pointless, nasty, unoriginal ""anime."" This looks even worse than that ""Ninja Scroll: the series"" washout. When I watch anime, I'm looking for something intelligent, funny, or engaging, or a combination of those three qualities. This is none of those. Go watch Grave of the Fireflies or Spirited Away instead."
1,I wont be damned,I bought this movie knowning it was going be bad. When I looked at the dvd it said Todd Bridges stars in this film and I knew it was going suck. Well I never got that far. I bought far better movies to watch then this crapfest. The movie was bad but did not really interst me.
1,stupid,I have seen a lot of stupid vampire movies. After this one I will not purchase any more that's not from this century. It totally sucked.
1,Crap dipped in crap with a side of crap,WTF!!! What a CRAPPY waste of time. Poor Todd Bridges. Again.....CRAP!!! I cant believe they even call this a movie. This is the worst piece of crap I have ever seen. What a TURD!!!
3,"Usable, but flimsy.","These dividers are really just heavy paper with a tab on the edge. Usable, certainly, but not very sturdy and their material should have been listed in the product description. I've gone ahead and put them to use, but I don't expect them to last very long and they will be replaced with something else as they wear out."
2,"Very adhesive, not very durable or cohesive","I have used dozens of brands of pad electrodes for TENS. These are the stickiest I have encountered, staying stuck in situations others would fall off. That is, sadly, their only saving grace. The adhesive tends to pull off in small sticky gobs during removal and cleaning. The leads are held in place very poorly, ripping completely out of the pads in some instances."
2,Maybe what I received is a defect???,"I spent close to $200 for this supposedly one of the best marine battery in market.After checking that the battery has been fully recharged, I took my girlfriend out to a local lake with some basic fishing gear. I am using Minn Kota C2-30 (the smallest trolling motor from Minn Kota) on a inflatable boat and I got 2 hours from this battery. I could not quite make it back to the marina so I had to paddle the last stretch. Walmart sells marine batteries for $70.... I am wondering if I should've gone with them...I am going to recharge it one more time and give it one last try. If samething happens, this is going back to Amazon."
1,dead battery no returns,The blue top battery is a good product but the one I recieced from amazon was dead and didnt work. On top of that you are not allowed to return the battery so basicly if you dont own a charger you are screwed. amazon needs to put a phone number to call with concerns. I will never order a battery from amazon.com again. buyer beware
5,Battery and price,"These are outstanding batteries and well worth the price. Amazon has the best price, only a $5 flat shipping charge and it arrived in 3 days.Excellent service and my personal experience with these batteries that they outlast anything on the market. Esp. helpful in Phoenix's hot weather."
5,perfect for boat racing and four wheeling,This is completely the best battery obtainable. They don't leak. They are nearly corrosion free. Keep them properly charged and they're maintenance and bother free. I have found they're very resistant to vibration and if properly mounted will out last any alternative battery in rough service like boat racing and four wheeling.
5,Wonderful And Interesting Teaching Tool For All Ages,"This is a wonderful teaching tool for all ages. The author holds your interest, while teaching you how to write a proper essay. After spending many years in school, I never realized it was so easy writing an essay. Thank you Mr. Cox."
5,Great Series,I just can't get enough of this series. Lynsay Sands quit wit and humor keeps me laughing throughout each book.
4,Single White Vampire,"This book is one of a series and they are all really good books. The author did a wonderful job in how she portrayed the Vampires, what an imagination she has. I look forward for more."
3,This book was okay....but a little weak on the story line.,What I loved most about this book was getting a glimpse of what goes on a book conventions....made me want to go to one!
5,A quircky tale I couldn't put down!,Talk about funny! Lynsay Sands is a hilarious writer. I enjoyed every crazy moment. She has a way with writing that leaves you laughing out loud and ready for more! I started with this book and now own all three in the series. I am awaiting her new book coming out in November. Watch out- you'll be hooked!
4,A light read...full of giggles!,"This is not your typical Vampire book. The characters aren't loaded down with expectations of what vampires are or are not. Mostly this book was a great quick read, simple to follow, most importantly...HUMOROUS! The first pages this book made me giggle and the humor was woven throughout! I have read quite a few Vampire books and this was by far the funniest. For a quickie book fix filled with romance, giggles and hoard of modern day Vampires...SWV is your best bet!"
4,It made me laugh a lot!,Single White Vampire was a humorous story that made me laugh a lot! I liked it.
5,just love this book,once again they get their life mate.. and as always I just love Lynsay Sands sense of humour... a great read
3,Decent,I have read a lot in this genre. The overall idea for the story is good. The author just tends to beat the dead horse on her descriptions of just about everything. Four + pages dedicated to describing something easily described in two paragraphs got old really fast.
4,Modern Day Vampire,"I have read many Vampire romance stories that are dark in nature, but this story of a modern day Vampire falling in love is wonderful. The story line is not as far reaching as you would think. And our modern day Vampire still maintains a mysterious and romantic nature about him. Since I am a BTVS and ATS fan I loved the references in the book about Buffy and Angel.I enjoyed reading this book and I hope someday to meet a man like this for myself!"
5,It is really funny and cute!,"Some authors try too hard to make the storyline funny, but this was really humorous. I didn't think I would like it because I read the fourth book (Bastien) first, and I'm not too big on comedy, but this was great. The comedy was natural and not forced, and there were many plots versus the fourth book. Whereas Tall, Dark, and Hungry was just a storyline with no real impact adding to the character's development, this book was absolutely great. It was not too ""mushy,"" but had the right amount of romance. Personally, I loved it. I am 25 years-old and have never read leisure books, besides the Twilight and college books, but I am fortunate to have found this series at Walgreen's!"
3,Silly; clunky writing; still funny and engaging,"This book is really, really silly. If you're in the mood for goofy, silly, and light, this is a great romance novel. If you're bored by overly detailed, clunky descriptions of everyday events and clinically described love scenes, skip it.For all that, it *is* engaging, and I would read the further books in this series."
4,Single White Vampire,This book was ok...not a big fan of Vampires. I hope Lynsay doesn't stop her Historical Romances. I love her added humor in her books ...but just don't like the Vampire route she is taking.
3,Romance Novel with Vampire Trappings,"I really like vampire novels, so I was eager to read ""Single White Vampire"" -- the title was so clever, I couldn't wait to see the book.I was disappointed. This book comes out of the romance novel tradition, and while there's nothing wrong with that, it's not my thing. The book wasn't at all what I was expecting: the vampires in this novel eat food, like garlic, go to church, and can go out in the sun as long as they wear long sleeves. In other words, the vampires have been cleaned up for the conventions of the romance novel.If that's your cup of tea, go for it, but this novel may disappoint those of us whose ideas about vampires come from the horror tradition and not the romance tradition.For sexy and romantic vampires that DO come more from the horror tradition, try Laurell K. Hamilton."
1,Terrible book,This book is like a bad Danielle Steele novel with vampires. A completely moronic story and a huge waste of time!
5,SWV,"Argeneau Series has been a great series to get into. Started with the first and had to get them all! Fall in love with the characters, I did!"
4,A good read,A very good read but a little too much sex and little plot. you will still die laughing at the humor of the book.
5,single white vampire by Lynsay Sands,excellent story.... couldn't put it down til I finnished it! I have purchased every book Ms. Lynsay wrote in this series after just reading one book.
2,It's ok,"Compared to the extremely enjoyable first two books of this series, this book felt trite and boring. none of the attraction between Kate and Lucern made a ton of sense. She made Kate a really annoying and boring character and Lucern was lacking in depth (actually, both were). I hope the next book reverts back to the enjoyable tone of the first two..."
4,ENJOYABLE,"I READ THIS BOOK IN TWO DAYS AND THATS BECAUSE PEOPLE KEPT INTERRUPTING ME ALL THE TIME, THE WHOLE ENTIRE SERIES OF BOOKS BY LINSAY SANDS WAS BETTER THAN I EXPECTED, MAYBE SHE WILL HAVE ONE MORE BOOK."
4,love it,if u have read any of the other books in the series this one is just as good. basically the same rythem though so if you were looking for a different story line this is not for u. but if u want the story of kate and lucern and their hot romantic tale all u have to do is open the book.
4,Lucern's Lifemate,"Single White Vampire is yet another mindblowing Lynsay Sands book. Lucern is being annoyed but his new editor to do some publicity but can hardly do TV when he needs blood, avoids sunlight and of course doesn't age. How long can he keep his new publisher and her co-workers in the dark? And how long can he deny his attraction to her a thirst he hasn't felt for centuries.Lynsay Sands does it again."
4,Romance,This was a fun book to read. I enjoy throwing in a little lighter reading between serious books.
3,Not as funny as reviews indicated,"The humor in this book tended primarily toward slapstick, and though it was funny at times, I've read much funnier. Katie MacAlister's Improper English is funnier by a a hundred miles. Some scenes, like the Renaissance Ball, went on too long.Honestly, much of it was too slow and uninteresting to me. It took me a good while to read it. In fact, I stopped about 1/3 of the way through and read two other books before I made myself get back to it. The second half was better, but it's not one I'll buy or reread. Then again, contemporaries aren't my favorite romances anyway.Nutshell: okay, a few excellent scenes, not that funny, too long, not engrossing enough. But I'm bumping it up to three stars to account for my possible aversion to contemporary romances."
1,This one sucked. And I don't mean blood.,I forced myself to finish the book just because someone had recommended it. Oh boy. The whole premise was really kind of silly. There was some steamy sex which I was really embarrassed about having read most of the book while at work. Auuuggh. Now I hate myself for reading it. It was THAT bad. After reading it I threw it in the dumpster so no one else would have the misfortune of picking it up and reading it.
2,Lucern: from grumpy antisocial to a puppet,"Lynsay Sands Argeneaus's books are nice romances, I didn't like this one. I had to force myself to finish it so I wouldn't miss the line of the whole series.Lucern starts as a grumpy, antisocial vampire but in the end he is a puppet in Kate's hands, going to ridiculous balls and accepting every kind of thing. OK, he is in love, but did it have to involve all that nonsense? He is often showed as a fragile vampire, physically and his strong mind disappears in the end.I wouldn't recommmend this book."
1,One of the worst books I've read in a long time.,"Boy when I read the reviews on this book, I wondered if I had gotten a different story. This has to be one of the worst I've read in 2003. The heroine was a fool and the hero was a pain. I saw no comedy in this book, barely registered the humor and couldn't even finish it. I finally skipped to the last few pages from the middle just so I could see what the ending was and if I wanted to try to finish it. Nope, ended up throwing the book in my get-rid-of-in-a-hurry box. Wish I could get my money back as this was not worth the money I paid for it!"
1,Want my money back,"Painful to finish.I thought with a series, this must be an author to follow. Ugh.I guess it was too Harlequin romance meets Lifetime movie for me. In fact, I could see this becoming an ABC family movie. Not a typical paranormal sic-fi. Is a typical romance novel....so if that is more your thing than paranormal, enjoy."
5,light and funny,"This is one of very few books I have read that actually makes me laugh out loud. The author approaches the subject of vampires and romance with a light touch. There are no fight scenes,no swords or flying or shape-shifting...Rather, Cinderella meets her Prince Charming in a very enjoyable work that is easy to read, and to hang on to for repeat readings.This book has encouraged me toseek out more by the same autho"
4,Great book fun to read!,I enjoyed reading this book. Doesn't go into a great depth but is enough to keep you stimulated.
4,Cute toy & good for fine motor skills!,"I knew I wanted a bead path to help develop my daughter's fine motor skills and I was thrilled to find one that was actually cute and creative and not just your typical primary colors. My only complaint is the paint is slightly messed up in a couple places. In general though, we like it."
2,Not Very Good,I have to say that I'm very unhappy with this purchase. Not only are the pictures not clear but the zoom is awful. I only wished I had used it prior to the 30 day return policy or else I would have returned it immediately. I'm very sorry I ever bought this camera. The only reason I am giving it 2 stars is it's ease of use... but that's it!
4,If you get the cradle ...,"Both the camera and the cradle come with a USB cable. The camera \ cradle plug end of the cable looks the same, but they are not. I broke a small plastic tab within the female cradle plug trying to fit the male camera plug to it. Luckily I had not tried to use the cradle cable on the camera. Keep track!!"
4,Reliable and cheap,"I have had my camera for 1.5 years. It's proven to be very reliable. I breed and keep siamese fighting fish and I need a camera to be able to capture detail of the fish through aquarium glass which are 6cm. It's been very reliable concidering the rough and tumble treatment it's had, including melting it slightly on a hallogen lightglobe!!!The down side is there is a need to be patient and take multiple pictures before you end up with a good quality photo. It doesn't work well in the dark and doesn't handle motion pictures well.However you definately get good value for basic photographs and realiability, it's a great, handy little camera to have."
2,Bad Battery recharge.,"I didn't have the problems that most people had with bad pictures. For the most part, my pictures came out surprisingly good. The only times they didn't was in low light situations and that's the norm for digital cameras. My problem was an on going problem with the batteries and the recharging. I have always had the low battery sign when I first use the A340. I'm sure it's in the Camera itself because new batteries don't even work. I looked at the battery area and I see signs of corrosion, but I use this camera about 2 times a month and I check the batteries religiously. I don't know what the problem is but I have noticed that I'm not the only one that has this problem. I have since bought a new Camera... Much better."
2,it kills the XD cards!!!,"I have used this camera for about 2 years, and have taken a lot of wonderful pictures with it, although I agree with the negative reviews (the quality is noticeably worse at 3X zoom, slow shutter speed, almost impossible to take a decent picture in dark places, etc).However, I believe the BIGGEST problem this camera has (and it took my wife and I a while to figure out wtf was going on) is the fact that it destroys the XD card when one erases all the pictures on it! It happened to me on several occasions when I was abroad in some beautiful places, and had the cards full with pictures from previous trips; I erased all the pictures using the ""ERASE ALL"" option in the menu, and promptly received the ""CARD ERROR"" message after trying to take a new picture.I am giving this camera 2 stars instead of 1 only because somehow I managed to get a lot of wonderful pictures (though I spent a lot of money on cards); I am currently shopping for a new camera, and Fuji is not on my list."
2,Fuji Flop,"I have to agree with erosomniac, from Seattle, WA. The FujiFilm A340 is a waste of money. I previously had a FujiFilm 2600 and it took far superior pictures than the A340. I contacted Fuji (sent them pictures from the A340 and they sent me back pictures with the same problems) and that was also a waste of time. Outdoor pictures are either too bright or too dark, really hard to get a good clear picture."
4,Fuji FinePix A340,"This is my first digital camera, I am satisfied with its capabilities, even though it doesn't have all the bells & whistles some other models have. For the price it is a good valueand I plan to get necessary expertise before purchasing an upgrade."
1,Was not working...,"The product did recieve power, but after buying a XD card not an SD card, we found it did not work. If it had worked it would have been a perfect for our child who wanted his first camera.The person we purchased from was excellent though. Shipping was very fast, and he had no problems processing our return. He even gave us a goodwill credit for our troubles."
5,Leapster,"All my granddaughter wanted for Christmas was a Leapster. I checked all the popular stores and found Amazon had the best price. Needless to say, she is very happy and so is her Nonni."
4,"Great games, defective product","This is the second leapster I have purchased, the first one broke after 5 months. The games are great and my children love them...just like the commercials state...but the product has a defect in the on/off button. Every other review I have read has this same issue, come on Leap Frog you should send out a recall on this and then make the new ones more durable, so after the 90 day warrenty expires our kids still have their game. So I had 7 games and no leapster to play them on, so I had to spend another $60.00 to make sure I got the use out of the game cartridges. So be cautious, the games are great and the kids love them, but you may be buying several of them if Leap Frog doesn't fix the problem."
5,Happy with purchase!,"Purchased for my just turned 7 year old. She's enjoyed playing with it. I couldn't really rate durability fairly as we've had it only 6 days, but it's doing fine so far and doesn't appear fragile. I'm happy that she can enjoy games that encourage her math and reading."
5,Best Christmas money spent!,"We got Leapsters for our 5 year old daughter and almost 4 year old son for Christmas this year. It was the best money spent! They both LOVE the games and have been playing for hours since Christmas morning. I can tell that they are already learning and the games are skill-building and confidence building. I cannot say enough good things about this product. We resisted the ""video-game-stage"" but friends spoke so highly of the Leapster that we decided to give it a try... and I'm so glad we did. Way to go Leapfrog! Keep these great, educational products coming!"
4,"Nice design, but too small!","The new pink/purple leapster has a nicer design than the old version. I like the new pen holder on the front. The arrow dial on the left side is better than the older (round)version, too. HOWEVER, we are exchanging it for the older version. The reason: THE SCREEN! The new leapster's screen measures only 5.4 cm - the old version screen measures 7 cm. Also, the pen on the new leapster is smaller. Customer service said everything on the new design is smaller ""to accomodate smaller hands""...that's nice, but it also requires better fine motor skills - which smaller hands do not necessarily have. For those of you who purchase this and are considering the recharging kit - I was told that this design needs the L-max recharger."
4,Love Leapster,My daughter is 7 and received this as a Christmas gift. She loves it and I love it as it is not only a fun game but an educational toy. The only complaint I have is that there are not more tapes for her age category.
4,"Good product but the ""old"" leapster is better","The system is great but I (like other previous reviewers) am disappointed in the new version. The old version had 3 great included games, one a memory matching game that my 3-yr-old loves. The new version doesn't have 2 of the old games but instead a commercial for all the cartridges you could buy. Very disappointed in LeapFrog for this nasty slight of hand, but still, the system is a good one."
5,Awesome game system!!,"I bought this for my 7 year old for christmas and she can't put it down...she got so many other toys for christmas and this is the one that she hasn't put down since she opened it...she is one that doesn't have a very long attention span and this has kept her attention for at least 45 minutes so far..that for her is tremendous!! The games are just so educational and fun at the same time, versus the gameboy, those games have no educational value to them whatsoever!! In reading the other comments I've heard complaints about the screen being to small but my kids havn't said a word about the screen, they see it just fine and I've played it as well and I see it just fine...it's really quite fun to play with!! I would recommend this to anyone!"
1,The Warranty is Ridiculous!,"My three year old absolutely loves this toy. He got it for his birthday in July. It's now a week before Thanksgiving and it won't turn on. It has brand new batteries. The battery terminals have been carefully cleaned. It hasn't been dropped, water damaged or anything (I keep it when he's not playing with it). It has just decided to quit turning on.I went to Leapfrog's website thinking (it's only been 4 months, it should be covered. Afterall, Nintendo and Playstation have a 1 year warranty as does most electronics). I get to their website and was shocked to see a 3 MONTH WARRANTY.A company must realize they have a crappy product when their warranty is only 3 months long. Any company that has a good product would stand behind it and offer a decent warranty such as a year.Instead of buying new Leapster games for my son, I'm going to buy him a DS. He uses his brothers and it's lasted longer than 4 months without any problems."
4,Great toy keeps Child Occupied,"Make sure you get the charger because it eats batteries! Greay buy, my daughter loves it and plays it constantly."
4,Disgusted w/ this Company!,"You pay this much money for a video game system and it doesn't come with the cord to plug the thing into the wall! HOW STUPID, when you buy a battery radio or tv they still give you the cord... why does this company consider this ""an accessory"", SO THEY CAN BLEED PARENTS FOR MORE MONEY! It would seem to me that accessories are the carrying case, the headphones, things of that sort.Very upsetting.The game system is a good one but I'm sick and tired of being taken advantage of!"
5,$139 For the Pink Leapster? OMG!,Quick...push your chair away from your computer desk and run to Walmart. I purchased this on Black Friday from Walmart for $30 but the normal price is still way below what this company is asking! What a rip off!
4,very happy parent,"The toy is actually an excellent learning device and my 2 year-old daughter loves playing with it. I give it high marks. However, I suspect as some parents might, that foreign language education modules will be forthcoming that give more value to the product."
3,Electrical problems and no return,My daughter received the Leapster as a present and the screen fizzles in and out and then goes dark while the sound turns into a static. I called Leapfrog and they told me to return it to the place of purchase. Since it was a present from another state we are stuck. I called Toys R Us and they wont take it back with out a receipt. Im disappointed with customer service and with the stores return policy. On the up side when it works my daughter loves it!
5,Educational and Fun Too,We purchased this toy for our daughter prior to a long plane ride based on a friend's recommendation. It was worth every penny. She has also used it to pass the time while being on long car rides. It seems pretty tough too. We accidently dropped it on our driveway and it held up fine.Our daughter is 4 and she loves having her own game like her big cousins. We also purchased the Princess and Clifford games and those were a big hit as well.
3,lemons and non-lemons,"I bought two Leapsters for my four and five year old children. My five year old has limited English and is very rough on this toy, but it has held up well. However, my four year old's Leapster stopped working within two weeks. We sent it back to the company for a replacement, and the stylus stopped working on the replacement in less than two weeks. She has not been rough on the toy and has barely had a chance to play with it much to her disappointment because it was her biggest birthday gift. I have considered just replacing it and biting the cost again, but when 2 out 3 haven't even lasted two weeks, I am not willing to fork another [...] out for this product. It tooks weeks of e-mails back and forth to replace the first one. Granted, I lost the receipt - had never had trouble with Leapster before, but I made it clear from the start that we wanted it for a long drive to our vacation destination - it was not replaced on time."
4,Great Value,Both my older kids have a Leapster. I paid much more for ours. This is a GREAT deal. Your child will play with this for HOURS at a time and LEARN while they are playing.
3,Auntie galore,I don't buy a lot of toys or educational items for toddlers but I'd heard great things about Leap Frog and Leapster. I bought the Multimedia Learning System for my neice. She used it for about 3 months and the screen is almost blank it's so pale. She's losing interest now when it was THE ITEM for a long time. I'm not sure what to do but I'm thinking it would be better to buy another than try for repair. Hope you have better luck.
1,Christmas Disappointment,"The Leapster System was the one gift my five year old was really looking forward to this Christmas. She was thrilled Christmas day when she opened it and saw what it was, only to be crushed when it wouldn't work straight out of the box. The unit would not power up, it was completely dead. Hopefully this is just an anomaly as most of the other reviews here have been positive.Amazon was quick to try and remedy the situation but currently do not have any more in stock so now I have to try and find it locally."
5,The Ultimate,"I bought the Leapster L-Max for my 6yo for Yule this past year and I cannot keep her off of it. In less than 2 months, with only two cartridges, she has taught herself how to write, how to draw, advanced phonics, how to follow directions, the color wheel, basic addition, subtraction, and multiplication, and beginning reading. All this without any adult interference or formal schooling methods, as the Leapster is currently her only educational tool or instruction. Simply amazing. Leap Frog games and toys are the only noise-makers allowed in our home, and the Leapster has yet again reinforced my resolve that I have made the right choice.Don't let the packaging on the games fool you either, most games made for the Leapster do work on both the handheld and the TV, even if they are not said to have been made for the L-Max."
1,LEAP PAD HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE,"We bought the new LeapPad for our daughter for Chritmas 2011. I normally don't write reviews, but everyone needs to know that leappfrog's customer service is HORRIBLE!!!Two weeks ago, the screen froze up and our LeapPad is stuck on the ""connect to computer"" mode. We can't use it. Customer service required me to send them some files from my computer and they take at least 3 days to respond to each email. Three days later, they told me (in horrible English) that their program didn't capture the correct information. Then, I had to send them a system file and some log files (not super easy) and now it has been over three days and I have not heard from them. This whole process started over two weeks ago. Great product, horrible customer service. Mark"
5,An instant hit,"We decided to purchase this as a Christmas present for my 4 year old. She loves learning, and although she has a leap pad, it isn't very functional for on the go learning fun. Since Christmas, she's barely put this down. I was amazed at how quickly she learned how to use it, and how friendly and durable it is. I would suggest screen protectors for it, however, because the potential for the screen to get marked up by the pen is there. I'd also recommend investing in a good set of rechargeable batteries and a speed charger; if your kids are anything like my daughter, it's a constant companion in the car, at home, and everywhere in between. It kept her thoroughly entertained while we were negotiating prices on a new car, and that speaks volumes to me :)"
5,My 3yr old loves it!,I bought it for my daughter for Chirstmas and she loved it plays it everyday. Learning her sounds also with the games i got for her. Just make sure u buy games for their age. Screen small but no complaints from my daughter. Great buy i would buy again.
5,BEWARE of the new independent re-sellers and rip off prices,"I have bought three or four systems and dozens of games over the years for presents. DO NOT PAY double for things you can get in stores. Amazon's price for the ""Pet Shop"" game was $40 more than just getting it at kids-r-us and shipping it last Christmas. I ended up returning the item to the Amazon seller last Christmas. [...]Amazon seems to have opened it's doors to all the tiny re-sellers that can not provide a good price since the inventory is so small. They also never offer super saver shipping. BEWARE of the prices and who is supplying the product. A quick drive in your car will save you so much money!"
4,Great Product,"We purchased the leapster for my son who is a very active child and hates to sit down to ""learn"". He is a little behind in school and we wanted to get something to help him learn but have fun at the same time. He gets bored easily so we were hesitant to make any purchase that would require more than 30 minutes of his time. However this was a huge hit! He enjoys racing and often selects the more advanced levels. We ended up buying a second leapster for my daughter. This has made our 40 minute commutes much easier!My only complaint would be that it doesn't have more games in the unit itself. I also would like to see more games on a preschool or pre-K level."
5,Paul Shepard was one of the most brilliant minds we had!,"Paul Shepard (who also wrote The Tender Carnivore, which is also highly recommended)was one of the most insightful and brilliant thinkers of our century. This book has the power and impact of Thom Hartmann's ""The Last Hours of Ancient Sunlight"" and the insights of Michael Tobias's ""World War III."" Highly recommended."
3,Circular Arguments of the Topic of Bioethics,"This book briefly covers many topics relating to bioethics in a manner in which it can be used as a textbook or a book for informational enjoyment. The best aspect of the book is its medical cases; these give real-life examples of the topics discussed so that the arguments and rationale are not so confusing. As a college student, I found it very helpful because it covered a broad range of ethical topics, including abortion, euthanasia, etc.Although the book was informative, the arguments were sometimes unclear. I understand that bioethics is a field of endless circular arguments, but the manner in which the topics were presented was sometimes difficult to understand. Some case examples were used but I think more would have been quite helpful. Whollly, the book served its purpose for me as being an introduction to bioethics, and it includes glossaries after every chapter to look up terms used in the text."
1,Not all its cracked up to be!,"I was eagerly awaiting this book only to find out that the 3 top local companies that I was interested in were not included at all. No big deal. They were little companies like Intel, Microsoft, and Nike.Don't buy this doorstop."
4,Leave No Stone Unturned,"I havent heard Midnight Strikes yet, but 5 of the tracks were on a demo the band released while still under the moniker of The Widow's Lust, given to me by Cris Bennett.Widow is the remnants of a Raleigh band named Sorrow Bequest who played a mix of Iron Maiden inspired guitar dueling (they actually had 3 guitarists) and death metal. The band became Widow, and hooked up with Leadfoot, ex False Prophet drummer Tim Haisman, who appears on Midnight Strikes.The music is great heavy metal, VERY 80's metal."
1,Didn't even use it. WRONG SIZE.,Pros:1. NONECons:1. It was said before purchasing that it would fit my 2004 Mitsubishi Galant ES 2.4 and it did not.2. Ended up returning it and was charged a return fee.
5,Taking names,"A side project of Shai Hulud that returns to immense breakdowns, and old school hardcore thrash parts. The guitar work, drum fills, and bass are put together nearly perfectly. One of the most prromising EPs since All Else Failed."
5,obvioulsy the professional reviewers don't own dogs!!,"I have been looking for this book for a few years and finally found it here...I had lent it out and never got it back...This book touched me and I loved it so much I have refered people to it many times, in fact, I am writing this because I can't believe the negative reviews I read about one of my favorite books! I finally found the book and want to order a few to hand out.Read it...it captures how real dog lovers view dogs."
5,Great,I got the book in timely fashion and the seller sent me the tracking information. No problems at all. I would use this seller again.
4,Great Mount - Only If You *Really* Want Low Profile Though,"This is a well-made, quality mount w/ very easy to understand instructions and all the hardware you need to install (mounting any flat panel is not an easy task - make sure you're up for the job).One word of caution - only but this if you *really* want a low profile install. Low profile means your TV will be as close to the wall as possible, which looks great, but makes hooking up power, plugging in cords, changing your set up, and uninstalling a major pain in the butt. If you just want a nice mount, and don't care if it isn't super close to the wall, take a look at some of Sanus's other adjustable mounts - they are much easier to work with."
3,WARNING! Defect in the mp3 album!,"Sony has reportedly fixed the problem with the first several seconds of a track missing on the CD. However, there is a major defect in the mp3 rip sold here on Amazon. The first 3 tracks are good, but the 4th mp3 track starts by repeating the last 5 minutes of the 3rd track before going to the CD's track 4. This throws off the timing of the rest of the album, so that track 4 ends prematurely (after overflowing into track 5) and the actual track 5 is missing completely. Amazon confirmed the defect was in their master file & refunded my money, but DON'T BUY THE MP3 ALBUM UNTIL AMAZON FIXES THIS PROBLEM!That said, if you can get your hands on a complete version of this album, it's a hoot. 40 years on and I still laugh out loud. So, five stars for the material and 1 star for the mp3 goof, averages out to 3."
5,Radio,Great Radio shows. Bits about the times and what was going on in the Flower power days. Old hippy fun before Cheech and Chong.
4,I'm a Firesign made man,"I cut my young tongue on Firesign Theater back in the early 70s and have been speaking forkedly ever since. I believe it could rightly be said, these wizards of weirdness are the reason I am where I am today. Where is that, you may ask? Hmmmmm... What?"
3,A Good Start,"Like watching an origin superhero film or a new TV series, listening to this disc is like hearing the beginning steps of a great comedic troupe. They have some hits and some misses. They are getting to know each other and figuring it out as they go. Not their best work but a strong debut and a necessary part of any reputable Firesign collection."
4,Recapturing the lunacy,"I was a huge Firesign Theater fan in the 70s when most of their albums were published. It was great to recapture the craziness of this group with this and the other ones I bought at the same time (How can You Be in Two Places at Once when You're Not Anywhere at All; Don't Crush that Dwarf, Hand Me the Pliers; and We're all Bozos on this Bus). This was one of their vintage albums. If you've never heard the Firesign Theater before, I think this is a very good one to begin with. Their humor is not for everyone, but it is extremely funny to me!"
4,"SENSE AND SENSIBILTY has both, in spades.","Jane Austen was a keen observer of the world in which she lived, and Emma Thompson seems to be a perfect choice for adapting Austen's work to the screen. Even the best film projects have problems from the beginning, beit insufficient budget, a less-than-perfect script or poor casting.SENSE AND SENSIBILITY sidesteps all these pitfalls and emerges as arguablythe best adaptation of any Jane Austen novel.The production values are sterling, and the performances could not be better. Those seeking a fast-paced adventure film may look elsewhere.However, if sensitivity, fine acting, romance and superb photographyinterest you, look no further! You have found it all."
4,Sense and Sensibility,"If you love period pieces, this one is a good love story. Full of struggles of the heart and humor of the time. A good movie to watch on a rainy day while curled in a warm blanket. Another great Jane Austen classic to watch is Pride and Prejudice with Colin Firth."
4,I really liked the movie,"Although I felt the cast a bit weak in parts, the movie was overall a strong and engaging film. The soundtrack was simply LOVELY. Kate Winslet gives a masterful performance as young Marianne, a talented and love struck girl who is almost too romantic for her own good. You'll love following her story. Elenor, played by Emma Thompson, is a little dry at times, but she gives an excellent performance. I felt Hugh Grant played a good Henry, a shy and quiet suitor, but I felt that it could have been a bit more exciting...at times I felt like his portrayal of the character truly took away from the scene itself. Good movie, I highly recommend it!"
5,DVD Sense & Sensibility,"I bought this DVD accidentally. One moment I was looking to buy the DVD Persuasion, and the the next thing I realized I had ordered Sense & Sensibility. SO far I haven't decided what to do with the 2 I ordered."
2,lacking,"The Emma Thompson version is not so good = so many details/characters left out.Col Brandon is awful. Edward & Charlotte, also.I finished the book then watched the movie.If a viewer didn't know the story I would think they'd have questions."
3,"attaching,a true reflection of the time.","This movie tells about basically,two tennage girls growing up in the early 1800's,looking for love ,facing the dissapointments of it.During this time if you were high class you were expected to marry high class.person with money.This was a problem for the girls,although they were high class,they had loss their money,pennyless.they were sort of, shunned by the society.This movie reflects this poetic period of history with a gracious splender which is hard to find in movies now.Perfect gift for your history lover."
5,Love this movie!,"Such a romantic movie with wonderful twists to the story. Great watch and will watch many times more. Also, buying as a gift for others."
5,jane austin fan,"If you are a jane austin fan , then this is a wonderful movie, well worth the investment. I actually like it better than another longer version i saw-it's full of great actors and great acting. get a bowl of popcorn and enjoy.."
4,Great performance by Kate Winslet,"Good movie, but I recommend you read Jane Austen's book Sense and Sensibility first. The movie is not exactly like the book , but still enjoyable. I enjoyed Kate Winslet's performance. I thought Emma Thompson was too old to play this role..she's supposed to be 19 yrs old in the book, she looks like she can be Kate Winslet's mother. Hugh Grant does a great job playing Edward Ferrars. Overall a very good movie."
5,ALAN RICKMAN IS FABULOUS,"This is my all-time favorite movie. The wonderful performance by Alan Rickman as the noble and romantic Colonel Brandon is one which should not be missed. The scenery/photography is spectacular, and Emma Thompson did us all a favor with the screenplay -- true to the spirit of the novel."
5,not just a girl movie,"I really like 'pride and prejudice'. I loved how tiny the events of all the characters were against the landscapes. In sense and sensibility I found those same enveloping landscapes. I only picked up this movie because of two reasons. I've already named the first and the second was because of Ann Lee's direction. He handles his films to my tastes. I have enjoyed nearly all of his films. The acting in this film is high, and it has a unique feel that is opposite of what is out today, even of Pride and Prejudice. I felt that the characters of Sense so refreshing to watch. I really like how hugh grant and emma thompson played. It's because of how they acted that this film is far more than a period piece."
4,Good story,"I have always liked this story. The only thing that makes me laugh is how Hugh Grant walks in the movie. He acts like he is trying not to do the ""potty dance""!"
5,WOW,"This is a deeply satisfying movie in all regards. The writing is superb---witty and sad. The performances are excellent! Emma Thompson and Hugh Grant, in particular, are especially endearing and inspired. The scenery makes you breathless. This film made me laugh and cry. I have not read the book, but I fail to see how it could possibly be better than the movie. Of all the Jane Austen adaptations I have seen (Pride and Prejudice, Emma), I found this to be my favorite. Watch it! You won't regret it. How did Ang Lee NOT win an oscar?"
5,Sense & Sensibility,I love this movie version best of all the ones I own. Delightful story re passions held inside and those laid bare for all to see. Superior acting. True to original novel.
5,sense and sensibility,I couldn't wait to get the dvd in the mail. I truly enjoyed watching this masterpiece; I actually saw it a few times!! Worth watching if you are into Victorian era movies!!
5,Excellent Romantic Comedy,"This is a great film. Outstanding acting, lots of suspense, and lots of humor. The scenes of parties in England are wonderful just to watch. The dialog is engaging, the filming is almost perfect, and the story line keeps the viewers interest from start to finish. Well worth the money."
5,A beautiful peice of classic cinema,"What a wonderful movie!Acting, direction and writing is superb! Kate Winslett is just glows inside and out. Alan Rickman is perfect as the hopelessy in love ever faithful and patient suiter to Winslet. Emma Thompson of whom some critices said was too old for the part and I couldn't dissagree more as she shines like the sun in her role. If you are a true romanticget this movie you will not be sorry"
5,The most superb version of an Austen novel ever filmed!,"Together with the 1995 Ehle-Firth Pride and Prejudice, this is the finest film version of an Austen novel. Thompson's script is marvelous and her perfomance is very moving. All of the acting is compelling. The interesting result is that the movie seems to have more depth and emotional power than the novel itself. A must-see for Austen (or Thompson) fans."
3,video is great - widescreen anamorphic DVD is AWFUL,"I love Sense & Sensibility, so much so I have worn out my VHS copy. So I was thrilled to get the DVD version - UNTIL I WATCHED IT. The ""widescreen anamorphic"" format is very distorted. The full width is there but they force the height to fill the screen, thus unnaturally ""stretching"" the actors. Wait for a letterbox version before buying the dvd."
4,Very good acting & portrayal of characters,"I enjoyed this movie except for the fact that there were so many ""previews"" before hand that the entire movie could not be put on the tape. The gaps were very obvious to me. I really enjoyed Grant. This was the first time I had seen him in any movie. If the entire movie had been put on tape, I would have given it 5 stars."
3,I was disappointed,"You cannot find flaw with the performers (mostly excellent), the visual (beautifully shot), costumes, carriages... but it did not feel or sound as ""Jane Austen"" as I would have liked. Perhaps I am unfairly comparing it to Pride and Prejudice (A&E;), but it seem to walk an awkward line between then and modern.My copy was poor quality, the sound of the commentaries particularly effected and was returned."
1,I didn't like it..,"Simply put, I didn't like it. Emma Thompson was too old to play a 19 year old. Not only did the movie leave out a/o change alot of what was written in the book the movie left out a/o changed the characters. So, once again I must say, I didn't like it..."
1,BORING,I did manage to see the whole drama but it was slow and boring. The pictures were sometimes interesting. Nice country side. Not worth spending 2.25 hours on it unless you play guitar at same time...
1,truly an awful movie,"Appalling!!!! ...Anyone who loves Jane Austen as much as I do should not watch this film. Sadly this isn't the only screen adaptation of an Austen novel that has gone sour. I have yet to find a good one. The acting is dreadful, and there is so little meaningful dialog, come on people! Austen's novels are almost all dialog..."
1,Some more boring film work from Boring film maker Ang Lee.,This film is so boring. So boring that it makes GONE WITH THE WILD look like a action John Woo film. Do not get this film.
5,excellent movie of Jane austin,Excellent Jane austin movieI had seen all of the movies here in the Jane Austen's setso knew I would enjoy itWhen I am down I just put in Jane Austin Movie and will feel better by the end of the movievery good acting and english sceneryHer stories are the best to watchwill watch it over and overchfancier
5,"Good, but has A Feeling of Being Rushed",The 2008 BBC version goes into more detail and I like it more. But this is still a good version too. The Movie it's self has NO CONs What-so-ever and has wonderful music in it. I highly recomend it to anyone looking for a clean movie to watch!
5,A great book made into a great movie,"Jane Austen's Sense and Sensibility is a wonderful book that transcends the ages. It's a wonderful story and well acted by Emma Thompson, and Kate Winslet. Not many movie adaptations even come close to the quality of the books they are taken from, but this one does. None of the quality is lost in this film. This S&S along with BBC's Pride and Prejudice are the best Austen adaptations ever made. Any Austen fan will love this film."
4,Sense & Sensibility,"This is beautifully photographed and well-cast. Emma Thompson did a wonderful job with the screen play, keeping it close to the original. Lovers of Jane Austen will love this!"
5,Romantic!!!!,"This movie is sooooo romantic!!!!!! Kate Winslet did a GREAT job and should have definitely won an oscar for her work; she wasn't as great in Titanic. Emma Thompson was wonderful as usual, and Hugh Grant and Alan Rickman gave superb performances!! Love it, love it, love it!!!! Watch it; you will love it! Now, my sister hates it, but that's cause she's weird. (No offense, sis)."
3,actors much too old for their characters,"As far as following the story, I think this adaptation did a decent job following the book. There were a few changes that I couldn't figure out why they did them, but they were minor. (why change Edward's engagement to Lucy from 4 to 5 years? Does it matter?) That said, everyone was too old for the characters that they were playing. Also, with the exception of Alan Rickman, the acting was stilted and forced. I never was convinced I was watching a story unfold before my eyes. I was definitely watching a fictional movie. Alan Rickman's performance as Col. Brandon redeemed this movie from 2 to 3 stars."
5,I love this movie,"I haven't seen this movie in a while, but I want to buy it for my collection because I know that it is one I will want to watch again and again. It is a great love story."
3,Sense and sensibility,"While the cast was stellar, the editing and screen play was not. I much preferred the BBC version on VHS (c.1987, distributed by CBS/Fox Video). This version with Irene Richard and Tracey Childs, was closer in content to the book than the more recent, Emma Thompson version. The BBC version did omit the third sister, Margaret, however the rest of the film and it's characters were intact and mirrored the book. Some of the scenes which I thought crucial to the story were omitted in the Emma Thompson version. Willoughby's midnight ride to make amends with Marianne was left out of the newer version and others as well. Thompson gets 3 stars, BBC still reigns supreme in my book, and Jane Austen's."
3,"Very good, but not perfect.......","The adaptation of this movie is very good but not perfect. The characters portrayed their roles very well, but the eldest Ms. Dashwood in the movie looked a little bit older in her role. Overall, the movie was alright."
1,Better to buy the book and video seperately,"This ""Classic Masterpiece Book & DVD Set"" does not do well by the masterpiece that is Jane Austen's book. The book is a cheap, flimsy thing, with significant typos every six pages or so. It truly gets in the way of reading. I recycled it.The movie, is of course wonderful, and in itself is fine, but there is no reason to waste money buying it with a book that is nothing more than a sad waste of trees.Do buy the movie, and do buy the book -- just don't buy this set!"
4,"One 1-star review, no 2-star reviews - This is a clue !!!","This is a ""chicks movie"", but really in the best sense of theword. This is a movie to purge the male thirst for ""action"". Youhave to truly have a heart of stone not to enjoy this movie.Kate Winslet was I believe only 19 when she made this movie -what a performance. I found Hugh Grant's performance a little toomannered, but Alan Rickman was excellent - as he is in just abouteverything he does - from the bad guy in ""Die Hard"" to ObidiahSlope in the BBC's production of ""Barchester Towers"".But the stand out performance is Emma Thompson's, holding in allthat emotion. Truly superb. When she thinks Marianne is going todie and her inner resolve slips - that is truly some of the bestacting of our time.This movie is wonderful. And no one gets shot."
5,Chick Flick,This adaptation of Jane Austen's Sense & Sensibility was an exceptional one. With the starring cast who could hardly go wrong. Enjoy!!
5,Anything by Jane,My favorite movie of ALL TIME!! Anything by Jane Austin is wonderful and Emma Thompson did a wonderful adaptation of this story.
5,Best version of Sense and Sensibility,Very enjoyable movie - true to the languagebut it comes across natural and easy to follow.Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman are great.
2,Get the other version,"Don't get this version. Get the 2008 BBC version. This version was poorly cast and lacked chemistry. Except for Alan Rickman who was actually pretty great as Colonel Brandon. The rest though, not so much. Especially Emma Thompson and Hugh Grant who had zero chemistry as Elinor and Edward. Emma Thompson was actually pretty bland. The 2008 BBC version has everything this one lacked."
2,not the best,This was not a beliveable story because of the casting. The older sister was FAR to old looking to be beleivable(I really thought she was the mother figure in the opening scenes)and her love intrest was poorly casted as to young to be even intrested in her. I liked Pride and Predgious far better.
5,PERFECTION!,An absolute gem! This is a movie you can watch time and time again. It is perfect in all ways.
3,Not a bad adapation,"Sense & Sensibility is my favorite Jane Austen novel and this film version was very well done, but it is also very abridged. Obviously the story had to be edited to fit into a two hour movie, but several important plot points seem to be omitted. If someone hasn't read the book certain parts of the story seem vague, such as the relationship between Edward and Lucy. The performances by the cast, especially Winslet and Rickman were top notch. In my opinion this has been Kate Winslet's best performance yet and she should have won the oscar. I usually like Emma Thompson, but to put it blunt, she was about twenty years too old to play Elinor. All in all this was a enjoyable film, the production quality and the performance by Kate Winslet is reason enough to watch this movie."
3,AMAZING,"I loved this movie. Not for its base on the classic novel, but for the personality the actors brung to their roles.These actors made me truly believe I was there.I also enjoyed the authenticy of the costumes and language.Even if you have never read the novel SENSE AND SENSIBILITY you will enjoy and fall in love with this film."
2,Not as good as 2008 adaption,"Other than Emma Thompson being way too old to act as a nineteen year old Elinor, Hugh Grant(Edward) looking absolutley stiff as board, Alan Rickman(Col. Brandon) looking as if he was sleep-walking throughout the movie, and Kate Winslet completely overacting Marianne, I suppose this movie is okay. If you haven't seen any other version this might seem great; but after seeing the BBC adaption, this doesn't even compare... Don't waste your money- get the 2008 BBC version."
3,"All right...slickly produced, but not a lot of substance","I was a little disappointed with director Ang Lee's ""American debut."" All told, S&S was very well-constructed but a bit fluffy.The costuming was amazing, though, and the cinematography was, as with all of Lee's films, impeccable.Thompson's best work, IMHO, is ""The Remains of the Day.""For those curious about this phenomenal Taiwanese film maker, I suggest ""Tui Shou"" (""Pushing Hands"" in English) or ""The Wedding Banquet."""
1,Subtitles,"I have ordered this movie twice,a used copy, and each has come with subtitles and no way of eliminating them. I don't appreciate them interfering with watching the story unfold.Chuck"
1,BORING!,This has to be the worst Sense and Sensibility movie. Emma Thompson was so boring and Hugh Grant had no emotion or heart. Had to watch a good version of Sense and Sensibility afterwards.
5,All About Austen,"Okay, okay, okay I KNOW I buy anything remotely Jane Austen. I can't help myself. I think I need a 12-Step program. The delightful ""Sense and Sensibility"" scripted and starring Emma Thompson is no exception to my compulsion. This is my favorite adaptation of the book. Kate Winslet, Hugh Grant and Alan Rickman are no slouches either starring alongside Ms. Thompson. It is a wonderful British romantic romp that always puts a smile on my face. I hope it does yours, too.May I take this opportunity to persuade you to enjoyPride and Prejudice - The Special Edition (A&E;, 1996)andEmma. Also two of my fave adaptations.Jolly Good Show Jane!"
5,"Stunning, picturesque and poignant, but overall just GREAT!","Warning!!! This is a biased review because this is my all time favorite movie. But here goes: Anyone who loves to be both visually and emotionally stimulated, you will love this adaptation of Jane Austen's wonderful novel. You don't have to be an avid Jane Austen fan to like this film. The costumes and especially the scenery were breathtaking. Kate Winslet's performance was spectacular and fit Jane Austen's description perfectly as did Emma Thompson. The score is to die for, subtle but moving. Everything about this movie is touching, but it is not too soppy or saccharine sweet. It is simple, yet outstanding. If you like this movie, I also recommend any period miniseris run by the BBC. Definitly avoid this movie if you do not like period movies, or movies with english sensibilities/language. But if you love great plots, actors, costumes and seeing the english countryside, WORSHIP THIS MOVIE!!!"
3,Hugh Grant short changed,"I just finished reading the book and watching both this movie and the latest Masterpiece Theater... The book does not spend much time with Edward played by Grant. He is hesitant and shy but it is implied that he opens up and becomes deeply engaged with Elinor- on a one to one with someone you are comfortable with, shyness largely disappates. Well, except for the end in which he is charming, he portrays Edward as stuttering and almost buffoonish- and NOT someone attractive. All they had to do was show them interacting and conversing and having intelligent interaction as couples who like one another do. Edward had to be ultimately likeable and attractive for the story to work so this was extremely dumb and happened no doubt because the book has to be read carefully to infer the type of person that Austen intended for the story to make sense.I would like to add that Dr. House- Hugh Laurie is brilliant as Mr. Palmer... brilliant comic relief!"
3,Sense & Sensibility,This is a good production of the old story. Good actors and nice costuming and setting. Good viewing for a wet Sunday afternoon!
4,Pleasant movie for Jane Austen fans. Sound not high enough.,"I enjoyed the movie very much but, as with a couple of other movies I have purchased from Amazon, I have a bit of a problem hearing the dialogue of the movie, even after trying it on 3 different TVs/DVD players. I recommend the movie, though for Jane Austen fans. I just wish the sound was better."
5,Great Cast.,I have to watch this version for a college class and I love it. Great cast and follows the book well.
4,Typical of Jane Austen's Themes,"Much have been said about the worth of this movie and I agree with almost all of them. I only have this to add: Hugh Grant did surprise me, it never occurred to me that he could be such a good actor. Emma Thompson is pleasant, mature and adorable as always. But having seen too many of her movies, it is not easy to focus on her part here alone. Allan and especially Kate was such a hugh success.Possibly one of the best Sense and sensibility we have, not only for this generation and for many generations to come."
4,Great film.,This is another great film that has been adapted from the Jane Austen novel. All of the actors in this film do a wonderful job of recreating the characters on the screen. It is obvious that a lot of thought was given to the details in the book and how they are protrayed on the film.
4,Eerie reality,"Rarely do I find myself thinking about passages in a book months, even years, after I have read the book. When I do, however, it means something extradordinary has happened. Two years have passed and still I think about numerous passages from this book. It is almost like a dream, unsettling and on the edge of frightening. I see the story as an allegory dangerously close to humanity's darker side. This is not an easy book to read because it is so horribly truthful at times, and starkly ugly at others. It could generate much debate about ""art"" and ""reality"", but it is not for the weakly motivated soul. Be prepared for a terrible journey buffered only by brilliant prose."
1,um...,"the description doesn't mention that it doesn't include the leash or harnesses, in my opinion, not worth 8 bucks for something so simple"
4,Historicaly Important,"An interesting read from both a doctrinal as well as historical perspective. Issued in 1947, the encyclical focuses on the preservation and nature of the liturgy - including the mass, the hours, devotionals and sacraments. Interestingly, many of the examples used by Pius XII in the encyclical, such as going to a ""primative"" original eucharistic celebration, the return to the ""table"" style altar, elimination of Gregorian chant, the use of the vernacular and similar items were, within 20 years, adopted by the Church as part of the Vatican II reforms. The encyclical discusses the symbolism of the liturgy at length as well as parctice and customs. A good historical milestone that presages the Vatical II reforms."
5,The mount does it's job,"We are using this camera mount for an older video camera that holds the small vhs tapes. The camera shoots live feed of our church services back to the nurseries. The mount is working well for our application. It could stand to be a bit more sturdy/stationary, i.e. not move side to side quite as easily when the camera is handled, but for the size of camera, medium sized, it does a good job, and holds the camera still when your not messing with it."
1,Very weak thread,The bolt that holds the piece that is attached to the camera is screwed into an aluminum piece. This piece has very little thread. Little thread + soft material = quick failure. It did not last very long.
1,Tunnel vision,"I ordered this book because I grew up in Knoxville as a part of the Jewish community. However, I returned this book after a review of the context, due to its lack of substance. The author was extremely weak on reporting the events which are now a part of the history of this Jewish community. There were many people who were an important part of the past that were not even mentioned. It was very obvious that the writer relied on personal friendships to gather the ""facts"" for her novel. If you are looking for a book concerning the history of the Jewish population in Knoxville, TN, don't look here. For those looking for a book that mentions their name, this book is perfect for you. My opinion is that it was tragic that some tree had to be wasted for the paper needed to print this book. Purchase at your own risk!"
3,Didn't work for my dog,"I recently had surgery and wanted to give me hyper dog something to help calm her down for the time i wouldn't be able to play with her. She is a very active greyhound/lab mix and needs a lot of exercise & play daily. I gave her 3 as directed on the bottle for her weight. A couple hours later i went to go give her a couple more, as she was bouncing off the walls. I went to go grab the bottle off the counter and found it missing. I later discovered it in the backyard. Completely empty. She had gotten into it and eaten the entire bottle. Luckily, she was fine. But it did nothing to calm her down. She is an overly active dog and it may have better results on an average dog, but it didn't even put a dent in her energy level."
5,Love these AG short stories,"History, a great story and an authentic historical craft! Not only that, but just the right size for girl-sized hands. A+++++++ Cannot be beat!"
1,"Where is this ""Economist"" from?","I had high expectations when I first picked this up, especially after having read the other on-line reviews. However, after having read this ""book"", I would question the credentials of the author. It is obvious that the author thinks highly of himself - I wager he is the only one who does. I wonder where he received his degree - if he has one. I was extremely disappointed. His science was poorly constructed and his conclusions were mundane. I am sorry that I spent the money."
2,A shaved ape could have done a better job.,"I know that there's an old theory that an infinite number of monkeys on an infinite number of keyboards could have written the works of Shakespear, but Nevaer fails to hit the mark of simian literary here. It's quite boring and his science is faulty, he often states the obvious and his conclusions are subjective and not based on true fact. I can't believe they would consider this a text book."
3,I liked it,"I lost this player, but when I had it it worked great. I like how if you turn it off and on, it plays the song that was last there before you turned it off"
2,tricky,"This is the first MP3 player I have ever had my hands on, and I must say, it's not bad. It's just a little tricky to figure out."
1,Firmware gets messed up by static discharge,"I had to send two of these back. It would work for a while, but then all of a sudden none of the buttons would work--it wouldn't turn off, or go to another track--all it would do was keep starting over again. I would finally have to turn off by opening the battery case. Then I could fix it by reinstalling the firmware, but then a few days later it would do it again. I bought it in the winter, when static is a problem and I think it was static discharge that kept messing up the settings. Maybe you could live with this gadget if you only wear cotton..."
1,Disapoiment,"Even though I think it's the best mp3 player in the market right now, referring to tech specs, uses and all that, it doesn't work properly. I sent it to SAMSUNG to get it fixed and they returned withouth the music that was in it, and also, working as bad as it was.I really liked it, but not working badly."
3,"Great Features, a bit disappointed by noise...","The features of this player are great... it has everything most people will look for! Other reviews tell enough about that! ;)In general I'm very satisfied with this player, but there's one thing that really irritates me : when you play mp3's with the volume set to 1 (the lowest volume), you can hear some noise on your earphones... In fact it appears when the backlight of the display turns off.As I listen to my mp3's at night before falling asleep, I set the volume to the minimum... and on quiet songs I can hear that awful noise... sounding like an old car's engine whistle...Don't worry though, when you never listen to songs at a low volume you won't ever notice that, but I thought it had to be mentionned!Chears."
4,Overall Great - Durable,I've had this MP3 player for a about 2 months. My initial impression was that it was a great player. Very small with a nice screen. I thought I would have problems with the battery door but that has not been the case. I've dropped this player off the treadmill at least five times and it keeps on ticking. My only complaint so far is that the player menu system bogs down while playing VBR WMA files.
5,Great mp3 player ! But upgrade the firmware ...,"I had bought the yp-mt6x (512MB) first and then found this 1G player. I needed a small player that uses AA batteries, there aren't many available. This one is great !! I had trouble loading it to full capacity until I upgraded the firmware. I installed v3.180 and have since had zero problems. This firmware works for mt6x and mt6z and probably the other mt6's as well. I am completely happy with this player, so happy that I bought one for me and one as a gift. It is extremely easy to use and has great sound."
2,e-books,"Purchased this item primarily to listen to downloaded digital books.The fault I find is: It dosn't hold my place in the book, if I change to radio or music. Result, once I begin listening to a book I pretty much don't switch to another mode until the end of the book."
2,Poor choice for joggers,"This player has some terrific features and battery life. I was excited to get mine but disappointed to learn how unreliable it is when running. My whole reason for purchasing a flash based player was to use it when exercising. Unfortunately, (and as other reviewers noted), this player will randomly shutdown and refuse to start for a while if you use it while exercising. (And yes the firmware was up to date). It was great while it worked, but definitely not worth the headache."
5,great,I remember years ago watching this on TV. This is so much better in widescreen and HD. I love it.
5,GIGI - FINALLY,"Finally with the help of Blu-Ray, GIGI can be seen and enjoyed like nothing else. This is one of my favorite, favorite, favorite MGM musicals. I saw this as a teenager about fifty gazillion times. I was so delighted when it came out in letterbox format on VHS, Laser Disc, DVD, however, I never ever expected it to look quite like this until Blu-ray. It is better than theatre quality. Anyone who really loves musicals will be swooning when they see this edition. Thank Heavens for Gigi and Thank Heavens for Gigi on Blu-Ray."
1,TOO MANY RELEASES!!!,"I TOTALLY AGREE. THIS IS MOVIE HAS ALREADY BEEN RELEASED 9 TIMES ON DVD. WHY IS IS BEING RELEASED AGAIN FOR THE TENTH TIME??? DOES NOT MAKE SENSE. IT WAS JUST RELEASED A FEW MONTHS AGO AS A 2 DISC SPECIAL EDITION WITH AN AMERICEN IN PARIS. I THINK WARNER BROS. SUCKS AT RELEASING MOVIES. THEY RELEASE THE SAME ONES OVER AND OVER AGIN WHEN THEY SHOULD RELEASE ONES THAT HAVE NEVER BEEN ON DVD NOT ONES THAT HAVE BEEN THERE 5 TIMES. THIS MOVIE WAS RELEASED IN THE FOLLOWING YERS:1999- FIRST ISSUE SEPERATE2000- SECOND ISSUE SEPERATE2003- IN A BEST PICTURE COLLECTION BOX SET2005- IN ANOTHER BEST PICTURE COLLECTION BOX SET2007- IN AN ESSENTIALS CLASSICS BOX SET2008- THIRD ISSUE SEPERATE2008- FOURTH ISSUE SEPERATE 2 DISC SPECIAL EDITION2009- IN A TCM GREATEST CLASSICS BOX SET2009- FIFTH ISSUE IN A BLU-RAY RELEASE SEPERATE2009- 6TH ISSUE SEPERATE6 SEPERATE ISSUES4 IN BOX SETSENOUGH THIS ITEM SHOULD BE DISCONTINUED IS WHAT I THINK. COME ON, RELEASE OTHER ONES!!!"
3,gigi..,"cant say i didn't enjoy it.. cuz i did.. and a lot too.. but.. i dont know.. maybe im not grown up enough.. but i didn'tquite understand some of the situations.. -_-;.. but i enjoyed all the songs very much.. leslie caron's acting fit the context.. but her words didn't.. like..waht she said didn't quite go with what she was acting out.. and i didn't like the story that much.. made gigi look so.. so.. i dont know.. she sort of lost that childish charm after she went out with him... i was sad.. -_-.. but the acting was great.. especially gaston's uncle.. i ahve forgotten his name for the moment.. i absolutely adored the songs ""thank heaven for little girls"".. ""its a bore"".. and ""shes not thinking of me""..^^"
1,Why this version is 1.33:1?,"Going through the new releases page, today 13th August 2008, I thought ""Woww, a new version of the great GIGI."" I was about to pre-order a copy, but when I noticed that the aspect ratio was not that of the Original Version, sorry thanks very much. I'll be happy with the version I already have in my collection. GIGI as a film, is sure is a 5 star picture. A film I always loved. I'm so disappointed!!!"
3,"Great Music, but....","Gigi, a musical about of a girl transformed to a woman and a playboy who falls in love with her, has some great music. The recent Blu-ray boasts some fine sound, but the video transfer is really not as good as I had hoped it would be. Granted, the film was made in 1958 and one can not expect the same high definition quality that would be evident in a recently made film. However, I feel that if a movie is going to be released on Blu-ray more care should have been taken with the remastering. I could not help but notice that with each scene change there was an obvious out-of-focus to in-focus camera adjustment which became very distracting as well as very irritating. I don't recall seeing any other remastered Blu-ray films where this was so evident. To my eyes shortcuts were taken to present a premature Blu-ray version of Gigi. More care should have been lavished on this film."
2,What Is Wrong With Gigi in Blu-Ray?,"Watch the American In Paris Blu-Ray and you will know what is wrong with Gigi. The opening sequence is grainy. The transitions from scene to scene are bad. It looks like the print jumps back to analog for a split second before the cut. I am very disappointed in it.If it wasn't for the extras, especially the 1949 Gigi from France, I would dump it.Gigi is a great film and one of my favorites but I was expecting a better quality from Blu-Ray.My old widescreen VHS looks almost as good on the big Sony.And where is the Overture sequence?"
5,Blu-ray Has Bugs,"""Thank Heaven."" Finally a decent version of Gigi now out on blu-ray. No, it is not perfect, but undeniably it is the most beautiful I have ever seen on disc. So, you may ask, where are the bugs? Watch when Jordan sings the title song ""Gigi"" as he sits in the park with the swans in the background. Look carefully and you will see a bug crawl across his grey suit coat and disappear over his shoulder. As many times as I've seen Gigi in theaters, on video, laser disc and DVD, I have never noticed such extraodinary detail of a creepy-crawler. This blu-ray is unbelievably priced at $20.00. It's a keeper and a treasure. Bravo!"
5,Replacement of VCR tape version,"Excellent delivery, on time and no damage in shipping. Would buy from this supplier again. Enjoyed watching again and the quality of the DVD is much better than the VCR. Glad I decied to replace."
1,Rip-off,"This is EXACTLY the same one as released in2000. The DVD box is copyrighted 2000. The only difference is, the slipcover is dated 2008. That's it.Just save a few bucks and get the original."
1,Not letterbox,"I love this movie, BUT... this version is pan and scan and does not contain the whole screen. It may have said that in the description, I'm not sure. but I was very disappointed and now have to buy another so I can see the whole movie."
3,Wide screen too wide,"It's a good movie. My problem was though I have a wide screen TV, this film went way off my TV in either direction, and the figures were rather large. Never had a film do that before. There didn't seem anyway to get two characters on the same screen unless they were close toether. Never had this problem before. No adjusting would work.I enjoyed Maurice Chavalier the best and especially enjoyed his performance when he sang with Hermione Gingold. ""Ah Yes, I Remember it Well."" Leslie Caron is much better at dancing than singing. She was too big to be a child, and her character's change from child to young lady happened far to quickly. Actually, she never looked the child she was supposed to be.The screen was way to wide for my TV and I have a wide screen TV. Was not adjustable, so I wrote Amazon and they took it back. Love the film and decided to order another one. The next film was fine. I'm glad I bought it a 2nd time."
3,Recording quality excellent,"I am glad to add it to my collection. Excellent acting, but somewhat weaker plot than I expected. Would have loved to see some dancing."
2,This Movie Won an Oscar!,"I've come to the conclusion that these reviews aren't very helpful. I mean, we are likely to review only those things we enjoyed, which obviously affects the validity of these reviews. So I have decided to review this relatively terrible movie. Leslie Caron, undeniably beautiful, was perhaps the only thing worth watching in this 90 minute waste of time. The songs were inane, as was the dialogue which also bordered on vulgarity at times. Uh, who came up with the idea that a story about training a girl as a courtesan in misogynist France would be a great musical? This might have been a decent movie if the genre were more suited to the topic - a drama perhaps. I must admit my slight bias - I don't care for musicals as a rule. They're just so petit-bourgeois. All right, some nice things about this movie... hmmmm.... nice costumes, nice setting... that's about it."
5,five star disc of a five star movie,"""Gigi"" is what Lerner and Loewe did after the smashing success of ""My Fair Lady"". Directed by Vincente Minelli, it dominated the Academy Awards the year of its release. It is one of the very greatest of the Hollywood musicals. So much has been written about the film already that I will confine myself to comments on the Bluray disc. It is, in a word, magnificent. The picture is crystal clear and the color ravishing; but it is the sound that for me takes the prize. The wonderful score has never before been heard this well, not even when the film was first released. It is sheer delight. Bluray is most often touted for the quality of the pix, which is definitely superior, but the often unbelievable audio goes almost unremarked. If you want to hear as well as see Bluray at its finest, get ""Gigi""."
5,A Winner,"The dvd is what we were hoping it'd be...a classic with some extras. My niece was really wanting it, and is so happy with it, it pleases me to no end."
5,Bravo! Bravo!,I think that GIGI is the best musical ever. I just love Aunt Alicia and her sister. Hermoine Gingold is fabulous. This movie takes you into a world that you don't want to come out of. If only they would make more movies like this today. My grandaughter absolutely adores it. I want to watch Gigi over and over and does not want it to end. I get lost in the movie and wish I could stay there forever. It is absolutely fantastic.!!!!! More young people should be able to see this movie. Whomever have not seen this movie they are missing out on life itself. Julia Reid
4,Gigi blu-ray,"I enjoy the movie Gigi on Blu-Ray.the picture is extremely-extremely sharp/clear far better then the normal dvd version,BUT every face in the movie is Solid Color Red.The Skin Tone is just way way off.As I said the faces are solid Red.I am surprised it was not corrected by the modern Blu-Ray Process.thankyou."
4,An Old Favorite,"I have to admit, I know rationally that this isn't a great movie - conceited clueless billionaire falls for teenager half his age, offers to make her his mistress, and a lot of slow goopy songs not essential to the plot line. Nevertheless, there's something about this movie that draws me back to it time and time again and wins my heart. I guess I just love Gigi's character - she's this person who has a kind of integrity all her own - I love how in the end she wins just by being herself and being true to herself. Paradoxically, she sacrifices herself to play a role that she isn't really suited for, just because she is honest enough with herself and with Gaston to admit that she loves him enough to do that - but her honesty shines through whatever she does, and that's what makes Gaston love her and marry her. Wish real life were like that! Also, the ""I don't understand the Parisians"" song is just the funniest thing ever!"
1,Gigi,"The Blu-Ray of ""Gigi"" is unwatchable - actually painful to look at. Appallingly boosted colours. Vincente Minelli, Hollywood's foremost colourist, would weep. I advise everyone to avoid this Blu-Ray and stick with the standard DVD."
1,GIGI-A DISSAPOINTMENT,"""Gigi"" has a cute storyline but was not made well. There is no foreshadowing and the characters do not draw you in. The story was difficult to understand. Gaston was constantly coming to see Gigi then storming off, just to come right back again. During the time that he wasn't with Gigi, you do not see what he is feeling. This movie is poor, and not worth the time it takes to be seen.P.S. Did you know that Gaston is at least 14 years older than Gigi?"
4,Emptiness in the Mind Only School,"Hopkins guides us through difficult terrain with an expertise that confers a clear sense of direction and a deeper understanding of The Essence of Eloquence.See the companion volumes:Reflections on Reality: The Three Natures and Non-Natures in the Mind-Only School: Dynamic Responses to Dzong-ka-ba's The Essence of Eloquence, Volume 2andAbsorption in No External World: 170 Issues in Mind Only Buddhism (Dynamic Responses to Dzong-Ka-Ba's the Essence of Eloquence)"
5,Excellent addition to the long history of Crewel,"Judy has added her own style and creativity to the ongoing tradition of crewelwork. She has used the various stitches in ways that are new and really guides the embroiderer to create beautiful crewel pieces. She hasn't just reworked the traditional stitches, but shows how to combine them in unique ways with modern colors and materials. She has ""raised the bar"" in the art of crewelwork. An excellent book for beginner and advanced crewelworker alike."
5,Excellent book for anyone who wants to know about Crewel.,"I am the author's daughter and growing up, my most vivid memories of my mother is of she and her embroidering friends, sitting in our living room, chatting away about fabrics, stitches and the art of crewel embroidery. I, myself, have only begun the journey of discovery and self-expression throught the art of stitching. My mother's book is an excellent introduction to any newcomers or veteran stitchers."
5,i laughed myself silly!,"I've loaned this book to at lest 5 people; they all want their own copies now. Mr, Kite has a knack for juxtaposng totally inconsistent images that makes complete and hysterically funny sense."
5,i laughed myself silly!,"If you have ever spent time in a museum, wondering why everyone is so serious (and not enjoying themselves at all), this book is for you. Context is everything;when you see the juxtapositions, they make perfect sense. ""Clumsy Nude"" alone is worth the price of the book."
5,Brilliant humour and collage,Barry does daring collages that may shock (thank God!) and humour. He has a refreshing approach and long may his career live! Thanks Barry!
2,Pay Attention to Color and Clarity,"I was not very impressed with this order. Received earrings in a little velet bag with ""Made in China"" on it. Color was not great, but OK, however the Clarity was poor. I checked and these are even a poor I3 for clarity. Was a late Christmas order so I did not have time to do anything else."
1,"Terrible Quality, no sparkle at all","My father used to be a jeweler. My wife used to work in the jewelry business. Both have always said, when buying earrings get a low quality stone. No one will notice, there's no sense in spending a lot for top quality when it's an earring. These are the exception. They are SO white/cloudy that there is almost no reflection and therefore no sparkle.Tried to save a buck, now they are going back."
1,"Really no stars, Sonnet is terrible.",I won't touch any of their items. First the business doesn't operate like anyone else. They just don't answer the phones.Had trouble with just ordering something from them. Don't trust them.
3,Usage of product,"Product is doing what it says it does. I still have an issue with running 3 hard drives.. The third hard drive displays only after restarting the computer. I've written to Sonnet, no response from them on this issue' I've also switch positions of the hard drives, made sure which ones where set to master and slave... This is when Sonnet should be responding.. hope their reading this now.."
1,Price misquote,"When I initially opened the title of ""Come on Seabiscuit!"" Your page said that hardbound editions were available for $$$...I clicked on it and the only options that were available to me was starting at $$$...this should be looked at and corrected."
5,Recomend this item to any math lover,I got my math degree in Ukraine and I read another books of Kolmogorov and Fomin. This is first their work in English for me. And both parts were impressed me. I got this book because I did not understand why price is so small. These mathematicians are both great and the book can be sold in similar price as rest of math books of same category.Bottom line. Book is great and material well balanced. Practice problems were prepared to improve understanding of covered material.As result this book is always with me. I do not think that I can add more to that.
5,Can't get any better than this,"There are 2 parts in this book. Matrix spaces etc are discussed in one and the second part covers topics like Lebesgue integration. After looking through some other text books, I have to say that this is probably the best book I read. I finally understand the topic very well. Also another important thing I like is the way proofs are written. If you have a class to follow, then this book is the perfect combination. If you have read the basics elsewhere that can also help. But overall it is very well written"
1,poor performance,"Do not buy this product. I am very disappointed in the product. It does not cool or heat as noted in the product description. When I set the heating temperature to 90 degree F, it still felt very cool. My space heater provides more heat out of the heating element than this product. When I tried to call customer service, there is no longer a customer service line. I have written them an email and letter and I will wait for their response."
3,"eh, they're ok","There's not much massaging going on here, and they are stiff to walk in. They are also a little tight, so you might want to get a size larger. Hopefully, they will sretch out a little."
1,Amazon's Use of DHL as a shipping service,"Please Please under no circumstance ship my merchandise I purchase from you via DHL. They are reckless with their deliveries and could care less if the merchandise is stolen or get wet. All they want to do is get it off their trucks. I live in a gated area and recently, a check for over $200.00 was left by them in their overnight envelope laying on the driveway and in the rain. I do not need this kind of service. Either ship UPS or USPS............PLEASE!"
2,Phone,"Phone battery lasted only a short time.It must have been used for a long time prior to the sale. However, I did buy it used and that was a risk I took."
1,Irratating,"This phone is very irratating. The ringer volumne is very loud and can't be turned down. Also the ringer choice is 3 very irratating sounds like I've never heard before. Very high pitched, pulsating sounds that are loud also. Also the caller I.D. is hard to read. The backlight is not very bright and this too cannot be adjusted. So...I will be returning the phone."
2,it's a phone,Really loud tone when you hit the buttons to dial and no way to adjust it. Very annoying. Too lazy to send it back and go phoneless. I'd look for a phone with more features such as volume control.
1,Never received,"I do not know how to review this item because I NEVER RECEIVED IT! My daughter needs it one week ago, we ordered it one MONTH ago. She says her classmates copies look nice but, again, she DOESN'T have one. The sender doesn't know where it is, our post office doesn't know where it is. Last time it was seen was in a different state! I'd love to review this book, but, as you understand, I must receive the item to review it. Oh, did I mention that we gave money, yet we received NOTHING?!"
1,Bulls***,"I stopped reading this piece of s*** when I got to the page where the ""author"" states that actor Ramon Novarro was killed when some men shoved a solid gold dildo (a gift from Rudolph Valentino) down his throat. First of all if the ""author"" had done any semblance of research she would have found that this was a stupid rumor with not one iota of truth that was debunked many many years ago. If the ""author"" can't even get this fact right then I can't believe anything else she writes in this book. Save your money. I wish I could get mine back. This book is going in the garbage"
4,An Affair to Remember.....Again and Again,"Without a doubt, this book is fascinating. Well written and worth several reads, my only disappointment was the sadness of their passions being coerced when each married another.We can only presume that MGM icons feared great financial losses at the box office if the two had married. Their magic on screen, maybe, was threatened if they'd validated their love in private matrimony.The book is tenderly poignant, a vicarious experience. Each died too young - in their 60s. We appreciate the drama of two talented beautiful people living a fantasy. Only in 1930/1940 Hollywood could it be so compelling....."
4,Still the best biography of either jeanette or nelson,"Despite a truly annoying tendency to take EVERYTHING as ""Truth"" instead of possiblities/probabilities (making the real truths seem less credible as a result), this is the only book about either star which makes any attempt to show the two as human beings. Furthermore, it is not marred by unspeakably poor quality ""writing"" or self-serving intellectual posturing. It is also written by someone who actually likes both stars and is an expert about BOTH their careers, both seperately AND apart. I by no means believe everything which is written in this book. It is also not particularly analytical about their films. Nevertheless, this is the ""alternative"" Jeanette and Nelson, and it is worth taking these claims into consideration at least. This ""updated"" edition is a genuine improvement upon the first."
4,A Good Linda Howard,"""Heartbreaker"" is one of Ms. Howard's earlier books (cc 1987) and it has aged well. The story is about a woman trying to run a ranch alone while fighting off the tall, dark, handsome, and single rancher who wants her land. To add danger to the plot, there is the frightening ex-husband who wants her back under any circumstances. I enjoyed this book."
4,A skillfully written romance story!,"Heartbreaker"" is a skillfully written romance story. I enjoy stories of this nature - stories of heartache, secrets, and raw determination showing the inner strength of the female character - to survive or to handle life as it is thrown at them. Stories that know how to keep the male character in line!Love Ms. Howard's writing style, characters and storyline. A Romance Novel I found to be very appealing.John SavoyC.E.O. & Financial AdvisorSavoy International MotionPictures Co."
3,Enjoyable Read,"Michelle is an interesting character who gives pride to strong women when she tries to run a cattle ranch by herself. She gives in to an old flame (standard romance novel). Rafferty is a sexy, cowboy who doesn't take no for an answer. Good enjoyable read if you want a quick easy typical romance read."
3,A traditional Linda Howard romance of its time,"Looking for something light to read after a three-book diet of murder, I chose this novel and was not disappointed by a heavy plot. Others have reiterated the synopsis, so I will get straight to the nitty gritty.This is a typically traditional 1986 romantic read and is obviously dated. Heroine and hero play out their roles with John playing the ""John Wayne role"" big, handsome and macho but all he wants to do is control and have sex with Michelle, the strong but fragile heroine. In time honoured fashion she owes him, he misjudges her, the ex-husband is on the prowl (which has been done to death) and of course Michelle won't tell him she is in danger. Needless to say, she is in big trouble before all is resolved.The plot is rather silly, and very very tired through having been recycled by a long parade of romance writers, but Ms Howard's writing is, as always, good.To sum up, pretty much par for the course for a 1980s Silhouette title."
5,Much Too Short :(,I really enjoyed all of these books. Especially Linda Howard's! They were muh too short for me. I get into the books like I am right there in the story itself and boom it is over! I'm like dawggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggg.Hope you enjoy as much!
4,A Nice Surprise!,"I had read Diamond Bay and Midnight Rainbow years ago, not realizing that there was a book about Rachel Jones' neighbor, John Rafferty. Based on the Kell Sabin series, as well as the John Medina series, it was nice to have a main hero who is just a guy. Not specially trained to kill you, not handy with all kinds of special weapons or martial arts. While John Rafferty is the standard alpha male, he comes from a different place, and basically just loves the heroine of the story. Also, it was a little more realistic that these characters have known each other for 10 years, so they didn't meet and fall in love in the space of one or two weeks. I found that refreshing. I don't think that anyone can top Kell Sabin for a hero, but John Rafferty came close for me!"
2,Heartless,"The book was too dated and predictable for me. It was obvious that the stalker was the ex-husband.Obvious, that is, to everyone but Michelle and John.I also found John somewhat lacking in the romantic touch. (...)He also doesn't seem to like her very much. Even when he finds out that she's just a loveable bundle of neuroses, he still thinks she lied about having been run off the road rather than own up to wrecking his car, but he magnanimously forgives her. Big of him.So I was singularly unconvinced when he fell in love with her, despite some pretty good sex scenes.I think LInda Howard's come a long way, but in this fairly early book she couldn't seem to make her heroes both sexy and acceptable human beings."
2,Reprint,"What's the copywrite date? 1986? I checked it out as a paperback at the local library. The heroine is not much of a hero.Better: Diamond Bay, All the Queens Men."
4,Vintage Howard - always a good read!,"The heartbreaker of the title is a perfect Howard hero - John Rafferty, big, handsome, quite arrogant, and a ""my way or the highway"" kind of guy. The heroine, Michelle Cabot, is another typical Howard creation, a woman who's abilities are seriously misjudged by the hero, who looks at her with his hormones not his heart! These two make a splendid pair, and their romance kept me spellbound - even though I am not particularly fond of a plot which involves abuse and stalking themes. Linda Howard's dynamic writing style and wonderfully sensual love scenes dominate this tale of courage and discovery - I very much enjoyed it, and didn't realize until toward the end that it was indeed a continuation of Diamond Bay. It goes with the rest of the Linda Howards on my keeper shelf."
4,"Alpha alpha male, but decent story","Note: This is a reprint of an early work by Howard.Linda Howard is a powerful writer, creating memorable characters and really stunning passion. ""Heartbreaker"" is no exception.However, those readers only familiar with Howard's most recent work might have a little trouble accepting Rafferty, the alpha male hero of ""Heartbreaker."" He is harsh and unforgiving, and his misconceptions about Michelle's personality haunt most of this book. Like many of Howard's earlier heroes, he is drawn to Michelle despite himself, and he takes a lot of that frustration out on Michelle.Still, despite Rafferty's harsh nature, and Michelle's inability to resist him, this is a powerful story -- one of the better of her earlier works. Enjoy!"
2,Only OK. Weak plot but still enjoyable.,"The underlying plot was John and Michelle immediately falling for each other but fighting their feelings for 10 years while they were apart. It was primarily her fault, since she tried to make him not like her by acting haughty. She feared he would be a heartbreaker. After they got together 10 years later, he liked her a lot but she kept assuming he did not and adjusted her actions accordingly. The author used Michelle's erroneous assumptions about John's feelings to spread out the story. Unfortunately, neither one of them communicated their feelings for each other which would have ended the story much sooner. I love this author, but not this book. It was well written, and I did enjoy it even though I kept shaking my head at the lack of communication. Sexual language: mild. Number of sex scenes: about four. Setting: cattle ranch in central Florida. Copyright: 1987. Genre: contemporary romance."
3,Vegan based nutriotion so limited if not aVegan,"Lot's of good material and helpful information. With the base theme of anything non vegan is not good it is somewhat limited in its use if you are not a Vegan. Outside of that I found it an informative, helpful read.John Gregory Vincent[...].The ""CURE"" for the Common Workplace"
4,Perfect purchase,"Got everything I expected. Book just as described, shipped in good time, and at a fair price."
1,Senior book,I too am an old hippie chick from the 60's but this is way way too hippie dippy for me. Good and valid information but too weird for me.
1,Don't Bother,I have bought and used all the low carbo cookbooks out there. Believe me when I tell you I rate this one dead last. I literally fed the cheese and sausage balls to my dog. This woman has no business writing a cookbook. There are some excellent books out there so don't waste your money and time on this one.
1,Don't Bother,"This book is what happens when a would-be author spots a growing trend and wants to cash in on it. The ""recipes"" are dreary, unimaginative, slightly altered retreads of what we've found in other (better!) books, and many are little more than ponderously described descriptions of how to prepare the basics that are already staples in our kitchens. If you want something really worthwhile, purchase Fran McCullough's ""The Low-Carb Cookbook,"" and hope that someone else of that caliber, ingenuity, and integrity, writes another book of that sort. This one isn't it."
4,"Great Ideas, Easy Recipes","I'm no gourmet cook, so this cookbook was right up my alley! The chocolate pie was to die for! It has lots of great and easy to prepare recipes. I recommend it to the beginners and anyone who is having trouble sticking with the Low Carb dieting."
1,Turgid faction,"Contrary to reviews I had seen of this book, it is turgid, flat, and poorly written. I could have bought it's like off the supermarket shelf. While it sticks, for the most part, to the facts, it is not entirely accurate. It's characterizations of the characters is one dimensional, to say the least, and creates not one bit of excitement in the reader. I am forcing myself to finish only because I have a keen interest in Wyatt Earp and the history of the period."
1,a DVD for folks with ADD!,"I can't believe anyone thought this edit for every shot idea was good, ESPECIALLY not a fan,I love the Chicks, the concert sounded as good as the DVD does, but damn.. the rapid fire cuts so that every camera change is from a different show, it drove me nuts, not ONCE do we see them perform a whole song, it's all hundreds of clips from every city.I gave it away and bought the CD version, and I'm glad I did.it may be 'live' but barely, this kind of editing style may have a home somewhere, but I'm stymied as to where."
1,This dvd is a lie,"this dvd is called ""top of the world tour live"" but it should be called ""images of a tour"".when i first brought this dvd i was excited but after watching the first 3 songs i was disgusted that they were not playing live it was just a bunch of images of them at different shows.i began to get a headache from all the camera changes and i am very mad.i know the dixie chicks are a great band but this is just plain wrong."
2,Beware - dvd lacks real live audio!!!,"My wife and I both think the Dixie Chicks are a great return to acts that can write and play their own music. We have seen the girls several times - a few at Lilith Fair, and the Top of the World tour. What a letdown then to hear that somebody made the poor decision not to use the live concert audio feed for this DVD. It has been overdubbed to death. There is not ONE ounce of real live singing to be had here. Who cares if the girls make a few mistakes, or were out of breath running around, that's the point of a live show. Thier other ""live"" DVD is truly so - and proves the girls are top notch talent - too bad some producer thought is was better to put video ahead of audio. Whoever that person was, shame on you - when you have talent right in front of you - let us hear them - LIVE - just like you advertised!"
4,Keepin' it real....,"Being a musician and having seen Dixie Chicks live on this tour, I can tell you that both live and on the DVD the singing and playing from all three is live.For people who feel the singing is not live, perhaps they are struggling with the fact that, yes, there are attractive women who are this good in terms of musicianship and can think for themselves. While I can see why some would find the video editing distracting, it has grown on me after a couple of viewings.My only complaints are that Truth No. 2 should have been included since it is a galvanizing moment in the concert, and that the labeling of the DVD could be a bit more up front so that people expecting a single live performance would not be disappointed."
4,Different!,"First of all, for those that have said the sound on this DVD is too perfect (inplying that it's been `touched up' in the studio), let me just say that I've had the pleasure of seeing the Dixie Chicks live, & they do indeed sound this good!The Chicks are great live performers - energetic, enthusiastic & entertaining, & you see it all here!The reason I've given this DVD 4 stars instead of 5 is that it's suffering from severe schizophrenia - it's actually filmed at about 10 different concerts, but you don't see a whole song from 1 concert. Instead it will be a few seconds from one, & then on to another. The first time I watched it I found it quite bizarre! However the editing is seamless, & it's fun seeing all their different outfits.I've now watched it a few times, & it's really grown on me!!No extra's to speak of, but then in music DVD's they rarely seem to bother with them any more."
1,Horrible,"Went to two concerts of the Top Of The World Tour. Orlando & NYC. Both GREAT shows! VERY dissapointed in this DVD. Choppy editing with NO continuity. Sweetened Sound Track with no Live feel at all.Don't Buy it!!Chicks, your fans don't deserve this garbage."
2,"Don't think that the word ""Live"" in the title means Live","Don't think that the word ""Live"" in the DVD's title means you will hear a live performance. The hyper-edited video appears to be synched to audio from their CDs (or possibly to audio recorded separately in a studio), with some audience background noise dubbed in to make it sound like a live recording."
1,Very Sad and I love The Dixie Chicks,"Where is the fantastic video montage that went with Truth No. 2? For that matter where is the song? It is terribly sad that this great band felt so overwhelmed by the pressure of ignorant people that the highlights of the concert do not appear in the DVD. I loved the concert I saw in Philadelphia though I admit it was disappointing since Natalie looked so sad and uninspired. That annoying splicing in the DVD at least proved it wasn't only at my concert that she didn't smile. And the ""Top of the Word"" tour concert without showing them play the song only so that there would be no mention of ""the controversy"" on the DVD? Frankly, this is just not worth buying."
1,Misguided Concept for a Concert Video,"It's different...you have to give it that. Unfortunately different doesn't always mean better.On the plus side, the audio and video quality are quite good. That along with the Chicks' obvious talent almost salvage a 2-star rating, but not quite.The incredibly annoying non-stop splicing totally ruined this video for me. It's quite distracting when the outfits and hair styles change every few seconds during a given song. Your mind starts wandering and thinking thoughts like...""I wonder which of these random video snippets from the various concerts actually goes with the audio for this song? 5 seconds here? Ten seconds there? Most of it? Some? None?""To me, a concert video should feature an actual performance. The fragmented nature of this collection makes it somewhat pointless to even call it a ""Live"" production.Overall, very disappointing and definitely not recommended."
1,No wonder I didn't like the Chicks!,"Thanks to the other reviewers out here, I now realize why I didn't like the Dixie Chicks at first. It's this dad-blasted video!! Unfortunately, this video was my first exposure to the group and, at first, I didn't credit the horrible editing as the cause of my disappointment. I blamed the Chicks! However, I just bought the ""Wide Open Spaces"" CD the other day and realize now that the Dixie Chicks is what I'm about musically. My favorite bands are the Byrds, the Bangles and the Buffalo Springfield so the Chicks naturally vaulted to the top of my all-time favorite list. Got to go out now and buy the ""other"" video (the good one) and the other two CDs. Thanks to the Amazon reviewers for enlightening me on this."
2,What a disappointment!!,"I loooooooove the Chicks. They sound perfect in concert, but this DVD was horrible! I was eager to watch it, hoping to see them sing a song entirely in one city, and then the next song in a different city, etc., but NOOOO!! It's a bunch of video clips from many different concerts that is distracting and gets annoying. Every song is dubbed in. You might as well just play the live CD and forget the DVD.... This is not what I was hoping for. Anyone want a free DVD???"
1,This dvd is a lie,"the title of this dvd is ""top of the world tour live"" it should be called ""images of a tour"".when i brought this dvd i was very excited but after watching it i was disgusted. after watching the first three songs i had a headache after seeing natalie in about 15 costumes now i know the dixie chicks are a really cool texans but this is just wrong."
3,Showmanship is lacking,"Is it me or do the chicks look like they are having a root canal during this video. The chops are solid. However, they all look so tense that the disk is a downer. I guess this was a tense time for them."
5,dixie chicks top of the world tour,"This is a very wild and exciting concert dvd format, so If you think you'll be nodding off at all, forget it... because each song is a mix of cameraq shots from different tour stops, so you will have maybe a half dozen outfit changes during each song, not to mention camera angles that change every couple of seconds, so don't blink.... but despite the frantic mode of shooting I really did enjoy the show because the singing and the music is impeccable, as usual.. This is one I like to put on when I want to just listen and occasionally glance at otherwise the constant flicking from one concert to the next gets to be a bit much..."
1,POP NOT COUNTRY,"The Dixie Chicks were driven out of country music where they never belonged IMHO. If you like your bluegrass pop I guess maybe you might like this, but listen to the real thing (Bill Monroe, Rhonda Vincent) and you'll be able to tell the difference.This is Yankee Bluegrass, Not to be Confused with the REAL THING!!Besides all this these people do not deserve our support!"
1,A Big Disappointment,"I purchased this DVD expecting to see a live concert from the Top of the World Tour. What I got was a music video with clips from dozens of different concerts. If the intent was to give an overview of the tour, they could've easily just put 17 of the best single performances from different cities. Instead, they chose to edit footage to the point that all you can focus on is the constant variations in clothing and background. For me, this totally killed any possibility of even pretending the performance was live. Horrible production here, and I can't recommend this DVD to anyone hoping to see a live performance."
3,"Great Chicks, MTV DVD","What a mixture of good and bad! You can't diss the Chicks - their songs, musicianship and general charisma just burst onto the screen. But whoever did the MTV-Attention-Deficit film editing should get a clue. The music needs to be heard without manic cross-cutting from concert to concert!And one more thing. Whoever did Natalie's pulled-back-trailer-trash-punk-country-Mars-Needs-Women-hairdo and makeup should study up on their Braille and change careers. Immediately."
1,What a disapointment,"Who purchases a concert performance on DVD to see something completely processed and redubbed? Chopped up into brief visual bits so as to make you feel completely distant from the experience? Why would they choose to put this on film instead of video, which is so much better for making you feel a part of the concert? Lots of bad decisions in the production of this. I didn't get through the whole thing, and I doubt I'll put it on again."
1,An excellent example of how NOT to edit,"I saw the Dixie Chicks at the Gund Arena in Cleveland, and truly superb they were. I'd been looking forward to seeing this DVD for a while. I watched it once and returned it as unwatchable.This DVD should be used in film school as a perfect example of how not to put together a music dvd.Contrast the editing on this with the masterly work on Peter Gabriel's ""Secret World Live"" DVD."
4,Top of the Line (mostly),"Great concert video all-around, but I would have preferred to see one complete concert without all the editing of footage from several. It's also refreshing to see the band focusing on the music, and barely even addressing the controversy that has seemingly engulfed them this past year.The ""Top of the World"" video included here is a nice bonus, a surprisingly effective cautionary tale that you may to watch more than once to fully grasp.Certainly this is a must-have for fans. And at the price, it's the best 10 bucks you're likely to spend all year."
2,Top of the World?,"I love the Dixie Chicks, but this DVD was disappointing. For one thing, it's the ""Top of the World"" tour, and they never even show them playing that wonderful, chilling song (although the music video for it is included as an extra).The other thing, as others have mentioned, is that the frenetic editing really takes away any sense that you are watching a concert. No audience interaction (except for a few shots of them shaking hands with people in the front rows during a few songs), no stage banter at all, no real sense of their unique personalities.Also -- Natalie should sue whoever styled her hair for this tour. In most of the many, many different concerts spliced together for this DVD, she looks like she has a bad mohawk. Not a very flattering look for what we know to be a beautiful woman."
5,"I saw this tour live, and this was like being again!!!","Well I was very excited when I heard they were going to have a live cd and dvd come out of this tour. I have seen them in concert three times and all times were awesome, but there was something special about being at this concert. I am huge fan of the Dixie Chicks and they have never once dissapointed me. If you are a true fan you will buy this DVD and the cd and you wont be dissapointed. The only ones writing bad reviews for the most part are just looking for a way to express their hatered towards the Dixie Chicks, which I don't get because they are one of the most talented bands out there. It was like being at the concert all over again! A+++++++++++++++++++++++++"
1,If you want a studio DVD this is the one for you,What a complete ripoff. This is supposed to be LIVE. That doesn't mean voice overs of flubs.Buyer beware
1,Picture Quality not good,"I was suprised to find that this dvd is non anomorphic. For those of us with a 16:9 HD TV the PQ when upconverted is lacking. For a fairly new disc not to be ""enhanced for 16:9"" TVs is a crime."
3,A Great gift for all Dixie Chicks Fans!,"I saw them too! But the DVD has not been released yet.They are so good, I give them 3 blind stars right now!!Could be fantastic, better than seeing them live.No annoying crowds or parking problems.Probably worth watching many times over.Picture quality might be better than ""An Evening With""If you crank up the volume, it will be loud!!Price alone is worth it. Can't wait to enjoy this!"
1,Farewell Tour,"I used to be big fan of the Chicks, but looking at this DVD I have to say that they have peaked and are on the downside of their careers. Maybe just poor editing on the DVD, but they just don't seem to have the performance of a couple of years ago."
2,they are a Bit too Polished for my tastes,I think they are Very Talented&Nice Looking but there Music is a Bit too Polished for me at times&Leaves alot of Shine without any Flavor for me.lots of dubbing here&it wrecks what could have been a Must have Collection from them.but I respect there Hustle&they are Talented.
5,Great if you ride,"I ride my bike to work everyday, when I am in town. 50% of the time I have to travel. So, twice a week when I am home I wear this bag when riding my bicycle. It is great! It is comfortable, sits low, and is quite bright so drivers can see me.This bag takes a little bit of getting used to as it is trying to do a lot of things. I still haven't figured out what all the straps do. That's not really a big deal to me. It's comfortable as a messenger bag and comfortable as a backpack. I am quite pleased with this bag."
5,Extremely pleased,"This is a great bag. Sure, the color is a bit garish but really not that bad. I use it for school and it can easily handle 2-3 decent sized textbooks, notebooks, pens, etc. and, most importantly, my laptop. The laptop compartment is nicely padded and the rubberized water resistant zipper is a very nice touch (the rest of the bag is water resistant too, just don't expect waterPROOF - fine if you're not walking around in a hurricane for a long periods). The laptop compartment is a little snug for my Dell Vostro v13 (a really sweet machine by the way, small, light, good looking, adequate horsepower and less than $500 new) which is a pretty small without being ridiculous 'netbook' small, but I'd rather have it a little large than a super-snug fit. There's also neat little velcro 'tabs' that you can place anywhere to get a nice snug fit.Overall I'm very happy. And you will be too!"
4,Works Well / Slightly Annoying,"The case works well enough. I like the top bars that hold the sleeves in place when the case is closed. Also, there are two rows of sleeves -- each row has an extra sleeve in front with an index card (it lists the numbers for each sleeve and has a line to write the name of the disc at that index). The only annoying thing about this case is the sleeves -- their openings to put the disc into have a plastic cover that must be taken off in order to insert the disc. However, once they are off, it never has to be done again, so it is an annoyance that only has to be dealt with once, which isn't too bad. Still, had the sleeves come ready to accept discs, it would save quite a few minutes of time. If wasting a little time doesn't matter to you, I highly recommend this case."
3,"A few laughs, no supplements, average quality","I have not followed the six comedians here as the majority of my inventory is of a different rating, but it will be a decent addition for customers that ask for the clean humor.Two of the guys get a little preachy, but most of them hit the same material as other modern comics minus the language and vulgarity. Always nice to see John Tesh as I listen to his radio show some nights. The disc has no supplemental material and the pic/sound quality is average. Some of the reviewers here dissected each comedian with multiple paragraphs, but I feel most of the entertainment here did not warrant that much description.I laughed a few times at various artists, but the production value could have been a great deal better and added supplements about the artists would have been nice."
5,Great family DVD,I really enjoyed this comedy DVD. It's good clean fun. It's safe to watch with the kiddos. No foul language or questionable content. Be sure to check out the first 3 DVD's in the series too. Great stuff. It's so nice to have something to watch that's geared towards Christians. Kind of hard to find in this day and age.
2,"the first three were very good, but this one was horrible","lets hope the next one is better. its funny the first three were very good.sadly, even my favorite, Taylor Mason, was not nearly as funny."
2,More of a yawn than a yuk fest,"I can't say much about stand-up comedy that can't make me laugh. Maybe all those years of laughing my a$$ off over George Carlin and Richard Pryor has jaded me, but I couldn't bring myself to laugh even once during the entire DVD and that's pretty sad indeed."
4,You will laugh,"Watched this as soon as i got it (long time ago). Anyway, it's clean, funny comedy everyone in the family can enjoy. I really did enjoy it. Not very long sessions but i thought each of the comedians were good. Personally, i liked them."
3,Safe Laughs,"I haven't seen ""Though Shalt Laugh"" 1-3, but I had high hopes when I popped this DVD into the player. Thou Shalt Laugh 4 does have some genuinely funny, laugh out loud moments. A bit about women's shoes was quite clever. But most of the routines simply offer easy smiles and there are some downright uncomfortable moments. Like the comic who seems to think that extraordinarily long, silent pauses are side-splittingly funny. (They're not.) Most painful is John Tesh, who MCs the whole thing. He comes out at the beginning and says his job is to stay out of the way. Too bad he didn't keep his word. Between bits he tries his hand at comedy. (It doesn't go well.) If you're looking for a comedy DVD that won't offend anyone, Thou Shalt Laugh 4 certainly fits the bill. Just don't expect to be rolling on the floor with laughter."
3,"Clean fun, but more chuckles than laughs","I love to laugh, the harder the better and this DVD delivered some chuckles with clean jokes that are fine for the whole family, BUT it did not deliver good belly laughs. Some of the acts are just plain useless, and then some are a bit better than decent. I can't recommend this because I think you can find better laughs on a regular sitcom these days."
3,Uneven comedy and not too original,"I watched this video with my twelve year old daughter. We laughed at a couple of the rourintes, but all in all it really wasn't that funny. The humor was clean and there was not a lot of preaching, but it just really wasn't that funny. The parrot/magic act was the funniest of all of them, but that is not worth the price of admission. If you are curious about this video, I would rent it first."
4,Clean Humor for Everyone!,"Clean, funny, and an all around good time Thou Shalt Laugh 4 is a great comedy show suitable for everyone. Hosted by John Tesh and featuring a variety of very talented comedians, this dvd will keep you laughing the entire time.This is a Christian comedy show, however it isn't completely focused on religion, and the comedians although stripped of the usual foul language you see in most comedy shows still push it to the edge. All around it's fun, inventive and great if you want to have a good laugh without having to worry about whether every other word has been bleeped out. If you like this one I'd also recommend watching the other three as well."
3,A mixed bag,"This provides a mix of comedians. Some were humorous. Some were more lame than funny or humorous. The comedians are all suitable for the entire family, so you can feel confident in watching it with your kids."
2,It's pretty bad when a Christian based comedy series breaks one of the Ten Commandments in the title,"All they got out of me was a few smiles, no laughs. I thought the first and second comics were pretty entertaining, but the other four had many cringe-worthy moments. I can't believe the people in the audience were laughing at these lame jokes. Maybe they have never been exposed to good comedy or the DVD was edited to make it seem they were laughing at almost everything that was said. Clean comedy is almost unheard of nowadays and it was refreshing, but the majority of this group just wasn't funny. I know many people in everyday life way funnier than these guys."
4,Great clean cut Christian comedy!,"Here's something you don't get often, clean cut comedy! Hosted by the one and only John Tesh. This has 6 great Christian comedians: Rex Havens, Joe Wang, Dana Daniels, Michael Jr, Issac Witty, and Taylor Mason. The only gripe I have w/ this DVD is that it was filmed in widescreen but the presentation is presented in 4:3 and is ""windowboxed"" on 16:9 TV's, hence the 4 star rating I gave for this. It should have be mastered in ""anamorphic widescreen""."
3,Cute.,"This is the christian media world trying to be hip, part 6000. John Tesch hosts a string of decent comedians as they try to marry stand up comedy with the Word. I'd say it works most of the time, and gets about as far as Donny and Marie in the wink-wink department. If you want harmless christian humor that doesn't preach, and actually DOES manage to make you smile a bit, this is it. I guess."
2,Nice Change of Pace - I Guess...,"I'm not prude, but I've often wondered who wrote the law that says a comic MUST use profanity.I thought this might be a nice chnage of pace - and it was. It proved that comics do NOT have to use profanity, but it begs the question ""Can comics not use profanity AND be truly funny? Well, not in the release, anyway. It's okay, certainly isn't ""bad"", but it won't bring tears of joy to your eyes, either.Next time I'm looking for good clean fun, I guess I'll have to dust off Bill Cosby's ""Himself"". I hope the VCR still works..."
3,It could be better,"Even thoug nothing will ever beat the first one it was pretty funny. The dissapointment is Taylor Mason, I love him as the puppet man(laugh till I cry) when he just gets on the piano and does whatever he is trying to do, its just not funny. That act is like something you do at a friends and family gathering."
3,Quite A Few Laughs & A Little Discomfort,"Length:: 2:40 MinsA few good comedians, and various opportunities to have a good laugh. Unfortunately there was also a couple of incredibly unpleasant moments as well.This was kind of like a date that was great at first, but didn't end well... if I had any desire to watch this video again, I may have rated it higher."
2,A few grins,"I didn't find these comedians very funny. So I viewed the DVD again with my mom, and she hardly laughed either. We both agree that Dana Daniels was by far the funniest show on the DVD, and that the rest of the comedians were just not that good. One guy had such nervous body language that we found him painful to watch and skipped most of his routine. I'm not sure why this is called Christian comedy... it doesn't have foul language but it does have a few sexually suggestive jokes that I found inappropriate."
3,Thou shalt laugh 4,"I watched this with my husband, and to tell you the truth, I didn't care for it. My husband kept saying how cheesy this DVD was, so that also added to the frustration while watching this. I only laughed twice while watching this one. This comic's name was Joe Wong, and I laughed when I heard Rex Havens' joke about the KKK. Other than that, I felt this whole DVD was a waste of time to watch. If you're a little on the sheltered side, than this DVD is for you, but if you've ""heard it all"" this isn't for you. The only thing I loved completely about this DVD is the fact that children can watch this along with adults, and there's no worry about cursing, or sexual content."
3,Kinda funny - clean laughs,"Some parts of this video were really funny. Most parts were like watching variety show comedy; predictable but dated. I do like the idea behind this series. A lot of comedians have given up writing clean comedy, so it was nice finding some that still know how to find the funny without being foul.Good for family fun night laughs...although kids under 7 may not get all the jokes."
4,Good clean humor...,"Thou Shalt Laugh 4 contains good clean humor for the whole family to enjoy. The DVD was completely family-friendly. Many comedians appearing on prime time TV are just plain crass anymore, and not suitable for family viewing. No crassness is contained in Thou Shalt Laugh 4.The comedians on the disc had a broad range of humor styles, which further contributed to the entertainment value of the DVD. I especially liked the fact that the DVD was ""for Christians, by Christians"". Thou Shalt Laugh 4 made me laugh out loud quite a few times with jokes that were sometimes silly, sometimes serious and sometimes just plain fun."
3,Mild entertainment for mild-mannered people.,"I have not watched any of the prior releases of this series, so I cannot judge this compared to the others.John Tesh is bland and well-meaning and really helped me root for the comedians to come onscreen and put poor old John out of his misery. I am certain that doing stand-up is very difficult and especially so if you have to keep thing clean and also with a (presumably) sober audience. If you are looking for something safe to lighten things up at a church youth group gathering, this may something, just don't get your hopes up for real belly laughs, just some mild amusement. Maybe it was my hearing, or maybe it was the production that did not include much in the way of audience reaction and I think that affected my enjoyment of the show.Christians gone mild, not wild."
3,"Low Story Arcs, Simplistic Jokes, sigh, clean comedy is mostly boring","Prepare to be underwhelmed. John Tesh's jokes fall flat. I can imagine that these comedians were underwhelmed by the assignment too. Joe Wong is the best of the bunch, but if you have seen him before, almost all of the jokes are recycled, so I was bit sad that I had seen him previously on the comedy channel doing basically the same routine.There is very little production value, just a couple of camera's and a stage.Maybe if you are completely politically correct and want nothing risky or offensive (except for sexism and racism underlying a number of the jokes), well this might be for you. Dana Daniels did ""magic"" with the aim insulting the woman he had invited up on stage.Funny, I thought there would be more religious jokes, but instead it was just standard fodder."
4,The Forensic Junkie Is Back!,"Hey folks, I bought this book and I was writing a review for the Nirvana Nevermind CD and it told me to write a review for this book. I'm 13 I really want to be a Forensic Serologist and Blood Spatter expect so I have a couple Forensic case books this is one of them I read it and it's not as good as this other one I have but this one has better visuals like pictures and diagrams that are really cool. SO if you like to look at dead people or you just are a Forensic Junkie like myself go ahead and buy this book."
4,Fasinating Forensic Facts For Forensic Fanatics,":) This easy reading book has many vivid pictures and facts. It was well researched and written. If your into Forensics and such, your NOT wasting your money/time on this one. The writer does not baffle you with fancy words he doesn't explain, or speak to the reader in a ""If you've got to look it up, you shouldn't be reading it"" tone. Worth your time!! Esp. if your just curious and don't want to get in too deep."
4,WELL WRITTEN,"THIS BOOK IS WELL WRITTEN , AND VERY INFORMATIVE.I FOUND IT A VERY EASY READ.IT ALSO BREAKS FORENSIC SCIENCE DOWN TO A LAYMAN'S LEVEL,AND DOESN'T USE ALOT OF TECHNICAL , SCIENTIFIC WORDS TO DESCRIBE CASES THAT IT COVERS."
3,"Picture-laden, text-light good general overview of forensics","This is a picture book for adults about forensics. The photos and illustrations are amazing, varied, and, often, gruesome and graphic. The text seems like an afterthought; nothing more than the basic information is given, and each case study covers the facts and very little else. This book is not for someone like myself who studies forensics, but rather for someone who is hooked on CSI, doesn't know anything about the topic, and wants to read more about it. This book is a much better general forensics overview and has more detailed information [and more information generally] the The Forensic Science of C.S.I.Hidden Evidence also explains the major types of forensic science [ballistics, DNA, trace evidence, etc] and uses case studies to document each field. Overall, this book is a good starting point for anyone interested in forensic science."
4,"Enjoyable, but you're going to want more information.","The book does a good job at very briefly going over the fundamentals of forensic science. Emphasis on the ""briefly"". Some issues / concepts such as DNA analysis get a bit more coverage. The 40 crimes referenced in the books description are ""poof"" finished before you know it, often two pages of mostly photos. To the authors credit the photo quality and layout are first-class. Also, only a few of the photos are really disturbing in nature. A brief bibliography is included. You'll want to check it out to get the additional detail needed for this subject."
2,Not Quite there....lets make it 5/10 rating,"I agree with other reviewers stating that it is an enjoyable and easy read. Having recently completed high school science i was dissapointed at the lack of depth the book showed. Even the case studies are a brief summary of facts and opinion. I'm not saying the book is bad, just that it's ideal if you don't know much (or anything) about forensic science.Despite the basic information i still enjoyed it."
4,Kentucky Bluegrass Award Nominee - Excellent Choice,"This book is a 2003 nominee for the Kentucky Bluegrass Award for high school students. I would definitely choose this one for any student who had an interest in forensic science. Hidden Evidence is not just a fact-filled textbook-type of book. Owen explains the process behind many types of murder investigations, from arson to drowning to poison. The details are well explained and easy enough to understand even for those who are not familiar with forensic terminology. The book contains forty true crime cases and how forensics helped (or didn't help)solve them. It contains many graphic photos of actual crime scenes, but is definitely not for the squeamish. This is an excellent choice for anyone who enjoyes reading about true-crime and forensic science."
5,Theme Music for the 20th Century,"I bought this CD for this particular (remastered) performance of the Candide Overture, but the total number of tracks makes this a great value. Excellent representation of Bernstein, a New York style and era where classical and jazz intersected. If mid-20th Century America were a movie, Bernstein, Gershwin and Copland would be the theme music."
2,Not recommended for first-time bellydancers,"While Joynan does seem to be a nice, pleasant person, I really can't say that her video was for me. I have never done any belly dancing in my life, and I found it difficult to follow along with her. In the first segment (which is the only part of the video I viewed) she wears a long navy blue skirt which makes it difficult to see her hips, legs and feet and what she is doing with them. I think this video would be better for someone who does know the basic core moves of belly dancing and just wants to improve or refresh themselves on it. Probably not good for a person attempting to learn belly dancing for the first time."
3,"GOOD, BUT COULD BE BETTER","Joyan's instruction is thorough and easy to follow, however, I would prefer less of her performance and more instruction in this beginner's tape. The veil dance is lovely, but not something I could hope to copy for many months; her first performance is something I would never attempt. I feel a simple beginner's routine incorporating the steps she teaches would be so much better. This is the first belly dancing tape I've seen, so I can't compare it to others. I definitely will continue to enjoy using this tape."
3,"Good clear instruction, poor quality","Joynan breaks down the basic bellydancing moves very well. You'll learn proper posture as well as executing the basic moves at varying speeds. However, she does not show how to combine basic upper body movements with the lower body movements you just learned...a very important part of bellydancing!! She wears a long skirt while teaching hip movements, which does not allow you to clearly see what she is doing with her legs. Also, while her dance routines are lovely, there's no way you'll be doing them by using this video! And, unless you happen to have finger cymbals and a veil lying around the house, the second half of the tape is basically useless to a beginner. If you're looking for a decent quality tape, this is not the one. You can barely hear the music, if at all, and the picture is blurry."
4,"Explains well, but........","I bought this is as a beginner video. She does explain things well, but the cabaret dance is real cheesy, so I always fast forward through it. The production isn't the greatest either. A good way to watch this video once you have the basic moves is to put on real belly dancing music and mute the sound on the video. But overall still a very good beginner video to learn the basic moves. I think putting an actual dance together requires another video that I'm in search of."
2,not at all what you expect,"Absolutely basic, it has a small sticker that says ""Basic Elements"", you don't see this until you get the video, the title should be complete"" THE ART OF BELLY DANCING WITH JOYNAN: BASIC ELEMENTS"" Dissappointing."
4,Perfect for the beginner!,"Joynan is a patient, easy-to-follow teacher. She demonstrates the basic belly dancing moves that will be built upon as one progresses.I really liked her performances that punctuate each lesson - they are semi-cheesy but extremely entertaining!Joynan made me want to learn the basics so I can move on to more complicated instruction - this is a great place to start!"
4,"Great, as Usual","Joynan has an easy, conversational, caring style of teaching. A lady in the true sense of the word, and a wonderful, talented, professional dancer and instructor. A good video!"
5,I'm a grandmother too!,I am also a grandma and I liked this video very much. It got me moving and now I am looking for a teacher. It is easy to follow and not intimidating. My grandchildren were really surprised.
4,Basic and Clear,"To me this video is very clear, I like the fact that she took the time to show everything little by little so the student can see in detail her steps. This helps a lot and make me fell secure that what I'm learning is done properly and make you want to go to the next level with confidence. Very well done, thank you."
4,A guide to get started in VHDL,"As the author, I wrote this book as an introduction forsomeone who wanted to learn to use this design language. It isnot particulary suitable as a reference guide, but insteadis organized to help you grasp the fundamental relationshipsand organization of the VHDL language. Even for experiencedprogrammers some of the concepts are a bit hard at first.We try also to include the motivations and uses for variousfeatures. There are a number of simple examples included.I hope you enjoy and use this book.stan mazor"
2,Not useful as a desktop reference,"My major complaint against this book is that it is not useful as a reference. The index of only six pages is hopelessly devoid of useful information. Nearly all keywords listed in the index merely point to a table of keywords, with no explanation or further reference. Not in the index: ""<="" (which has two meanings), ""explicit literal"", ""aggregate"", and ""assignment statement"", for example. Index often references wrong page. Typos (""discreet"", ""scaler"") abound."
3,One creepy little film,"It may sound charming, but this video is not for young kids. The first five minutes were enough to give me nightmares for months. I'm fifteen,( not 12 ) and I probably still couldn't bring myself to watch it. It's a pretty obscure film these days, but think twice before letting kids under ten watch it. The""ragman"" WILL freak you out, if you've seen it, you know what I'm talking about. The first 5 minutes are a mixture of moody scenery, truly frightening images, and haunting, scary music.I didn't pay much attention to the few times I made it past the beginning. It was an alright movie, but every little thing about it had this moody, haunting feel about it. I wish there was a website about this flick, but there probably will never be. But that ragman, ( shudders )"
4,"Love this movie, afraid to play VHS...","I kept / stole this VHS when I left the nest at 18 - eventually I became too scared to actually play it, for fear of the VHS player 'eating' the tape. It sits on my shelf, awaiting my motivation to pay someone to transfer it to dvd for me (I no longer even own a VHS player).I adore this movie. I would give it 5 stars, but I realize that it holds a place in my heart from watching it very young that makes it better than it truly is. The stop animation is gorgeous, it has some truly scary sequences, and is overall haunting and memorable - a real gem, but one very hidden (I'm surprised when anyone else besides me has seen it). Bonus: Christopher Lee's voice. *joy*"
3,Intro may scare,"I remember seeing this movie when I was a child at the movie theatre and it gave me nightmares - The rag man was the scary part. Some reviewers have stated that this was not scary for them and that may be true, but parents should know the capabilities of their kids. I would recommend watching the movie first just to be on the safe side. Looking back on it as an adult is amusing, but I was scared at the theatre. You can see the intro on youtube."
5,Childhood memories...,"I loved this movie as a child, I wish it would come out on DVD. I have looked every where for it. Can't believe what people are selling it for on here and Ebay."
4,"scary,but the best anime cartoon ever","I have been watching it since I was nine years old and I find some parts in this cartoon scary,like the ragman and the two-headed queen morphia,it took me a few months to over that one.I still have that tape my mom recorded for us.But it's not all that bad.Well,you know as they say,seeing is believing.I like to see this one on DVD also just like so many other classic anime have been put on DVD."
3,"Good, but tramautizing.",Possibly one of the scariest movies I've ever seen and I'm serious.. but its really well made.
4,A must-read for all engineers,"This book is packed with useful tips for excelling in the corporate environment. It is all about the ""whens"" and ""hows"" of making a good impression and achieving the greatest impact. This is not a technical book--it focuses more on how to deal with the organization. It includes tips like how to find and utilize a good mentor, and the importance of maintaining a company calendar (for scheduling requests when they will have the most impact).The editing of this book is poor--it has a lot of typographical and grammatical errors. But if you look beyond the writing errors, there is an awful lot of useful, practical information. This is a book that every engineer, from the new college graduate to the senior engineer, should read."
2,Book for the clueless,"This is one of those books that spews out common-sense advice such as ""know what gets you ahead"" and ""seek out opportunities to excel."" Okay, this might be useful information for some. For the most part, though, this will only be useful to those who are really out of touch with what it takes to get ahead. And it is going to take more than reading this book to change that."
3,Career Advancement - For certain companies,"John Hoschette provides valuable insight for advancement, not only for the target audience of engineers, but also for technical professionals. The book details what is necessary to defeat the bureaucratic mentality and get ahead. The only caution that I would give is that it applies to large, stratified companies. Those employed in many of today's lean thinking companies will find his advice somewhat out of date. Even in those companies, the fundamentals provide a good insight and historical perspective to the environments that made lean manufacturing a necessity."
5,Simply the best,"(Basically the same review as I gave Season 2) While being a football fan or even someone who is in a FF League helps with the enjoyment of the show you really do not have to like either to absolutely love this show. The characters and how they interact with one another is more than enough to hook you on the show. It is well written, well acted, and simply hilarious.One thing of note though is that I enjoy Season 1 more than 2 but both are great."
5,Funniest show in years,Love the series and the outtakes are hilarious. We have watched it about 3 times already and laugh everytime. It's too raw for kids but if you watch the series on cable the DVD is 10x better
2,Recieved a broken product,"First off the bat I am rating this low because of the handling and condition I received it in. This show is funny as crap, and I sincerely believe that everyone should watch this show. I ordered it from Amazon and it got to me in great time, but inside of the case the disc holder was broken off and just moving inside of it. This caused one of the disc to become scratched."
5,Great show.,"I wish it was more than 6 episodes, but this show is awesome. So funny. Can't wait to get the other seasons."
5,hilarious,"this is a great show, very entertaining and funny. please understand this is raunchy and inappropriate for the young ones. hilarious."
4,only 6 episodes so dont overpay,"great show, it is only 6 episodes long. so dont overpay for it. funny over the top jokes by a great set of actors"
4,Funny show...,"I had never seen this show before I bought it for a gift. My husband had mentioned that he liked it and since we no longer have cable I bought the first two seasons on Blu-ray. The first season was funny and I did enjoy the show. The extras are LIGHT! There isn't much more than a let down of a blooper reel and a few additional scenes. If you don't need anything more than the episodes, pick up the DVD at a cheeper cost."
5,Amazing,"Not a bad DVD, but you can find most if not all of it online. The show itself however. It's a great show. It's like Football, meets a comedy central roast, meets south park.It's a group of friends that love football, their lives are all about fantasy football and their biggest goal outside of winning their league is insulting each other. It's one of the funniest shows you will watch and if you're not too familiar with FX tv shows, you might be surprised by what they can get away with."
5,Product review,Thank you for sending The League: Season 1. I received it in a very timely manner for a very reasonable price. I will definitely continue to shop on Amazon.com if this service continues.
2,Tears to the Eyes,"I have not owned any Groove albums, but I heard one track on the radio, and then I sampled the tracks on this album. This live stuff is raw, energized, soulful, gritty, down home true Hammond B3. From what I can tell on these short samples, these tracks are not befogged in a stew of corny 60's and 70's ""progressive"" crap... and so much the better! I'm ordering it now, to go with my other B3 stuff."
5,his,best CD ever. Mellow and romantic story telling at his best! This is a great CD by a fireplace and a glass of wine :-)
4,Fascinating Read,"This was definitely a page-turner! I live in this area. So, it was interesting to imagine that this went on right here! I had never heard about it, and I have lived here for the last 25 years. Makes me want to examine all the houses and areas they went to.The book is written with a newspaper sensationalism kind of feel, but that shouldn't bother you too much."
2,it okay but nothing to get crazy over.,"A friend of mine let me listen to this cd. Its okay. Some of the songs are a little over done like ""thoughts on loves mishaps"" not to mention his vocals are close to every other radio musicians out there. but hey if this is your thing listen to it, i know i wont."
1,pure generic garbage,"people always told me how great they are--lies, all lies. this stuff is totally derivative of all the other emo pansy rock that has been infecting the country in recent years. steer clear of this one"
1,my ears!!!,"what an awful and uninspired band, i personally could'nt stand any of these songs for more than a few seconds before i changed tracks, his voice is like a turd covered in burnt hair, joel hamilton burn in hell"
4,Brilliant!,"I work at a college radio station and when we received this cd, I was immediately hooked. I later found out that the song I kept hearing in my head on the American Wedding movie was actually their song ""Beloved."" It's straight up rock and the vocals are very hard hitting. The chorus in ""Something she said"" gave me goosebumps the first time I heard it. If I had to compare them to any band, I'd probably pick the Goo Goo Dolls without Johnny's vocals and replace them with someone else's. I can't quite put my finger on it. Very highly reccomended!!"
5,"""must have down-tempo electronica""","If you like the new Zero 7 record, you'll love Aria's Haze! Soothing lounge trip-hop electronica...turn on, tune in and zone out! Get lost in the HAZE!"
2,Almost good and could have been great,"Musically, there are a fair number of interesting bits going on. And as far as non-raregroove downtempo goes, it would actually be not half bad ... a nice intro or sophomore effort perhaps while the group is still finding their sound. But the vocals take away big points. Whatever inspired qualities it may have had musically are all but drowned out with lyrics that venture off into hip hop territories that feel incongruent with everything else on the disc. But let's await their next release before dismissing them entirely..."
3,Plays like a respectable b-sides release,This is a fun but ultimately disposable transitional work which carries neither the tunefulness of early work nor the intense experimentation of later years enough though can occasionally provide graciously rendered grooves.
2,disappointing... and maximum priest was so good.,"squarepusher a reactionary? who knew? this album seems to cast off the brilliance of his last three releases and revert to his rave days. there's nothing especially wrong with that, but this record simply seems immature, coming after the abstract beauty of Maximum Priest and Budahkan Mindphone."
1,Vastly Disappointing,"I have to say i tried to listen to this with an open mind. but you know, there just aren't any lyrics? What the H*ECK am i supposed to listen to? i don't quite agree with the first reviewer, as i don't like bone thugz n harmony, but having just listened to Hey Ya! for 3 days straight, i find this really lacking. especially compared to mister Tom's prior releases, this blows.If you want finely crafted music with spot on vocals, you just can't beat Merzbow. Much better than squarepooper."
4,Drum 'n' Bass a la Jenkinson,"Squarepusher's work from Big Loada and earlier found Tom Jenkinson ridiculing the excesses of the drum 'n' bass genre. On Music Is Rotted One Note, he shifted to fusion jazz, and since then has been moving back towards drum 'n' bass. However, until Selection Sixteen, no post-Rotted Squarepusher releases could truly be considered drum 'n' bass. Now, Tom Jenkinson delivers like crazy. There are three main styles present: Insane Drum 'n' Bass, short Jazzy ditties, and Acid House-ish tracks. The Drum 'n' Bass work here is among his best and most difficult/interesting. The Jazz bits are similar to the style of Moondog in that they are short, simple themes that don't require much elaboration. On this album, they are used as segues between tracks. But the acid house tracks are terrible filler. So, on the whole, the album is excellent and points to an amazing future. Bottom Line: 12 out of 17 tracks are five-star-worthy songs."
4,Gloriously frustrating!!!,"Good resource for interesting tidbits. You'll have to wade past the 'feminazi' attitude but there is real treasure here. Hours of fun, but frustrating in that some of the material is poorly referenced, but it sure is thought provoking. This book will make you mad!"
1,Excellent... as a doorstop,"I was very excited when I first bought this book years ago. As a naive grad student I thought I had found a treasure chest of information, but I quickly found out that I was very wrong. There is a lot of information in there, but most of it is simply not verifiable. This should be taken the same way as The Golden Bough by Frazer. As it is quite a large book, the least one could do is recycle it and use it for a doorstop! There are several other reviews here with examples, so I'll refer you to those."
2,Didn't like it,I don't return too many books but this one I sent back. It was too hokey for one thing with all of the hocus pocus reference. Seemed to anti-man and just all around not my thing. I don't know about the accuracy of the contents as others referenced. This is one case where I'd really recommend going to a physical bookshop to look at it before buying it to see if you like it. It's a big thick book - one that you'd have to really like to get through - not a small commitment. Thumbs down from me.
5,All the answers women need but can't always find,"This book covers as many topics as possible in short, concise answers to questions both common and arcane. This is not a feminist tirade; it is fact.This a must read for all women, if only to permit their understanding of why their lives have been so naroowly defined in the supposedly ""modern world""."
5,Full of interesting possibilities,"I wouldn't recommend this work as a reference for scholars, but perhaps as a reference for poets and other writers. While etymological 'connections' are often used to make sweeping claims that don't stand up to even light scrutiny, this sort of thing can be fun, if not inspiring, where not taken too seriously. I don't think the author's substantial effort was wasted at all."
2,Interesting Myth,"Fun read!I don't think it holds up under scrutiny, but it's great to finally see a work of pop mythology. The incomplete scholarship and wild references are a constant chuckle and I would recommend the work to anyone who needed a pick-me-up. I do wish Ms. Walker would update it however - a lot of archealogy and research has happened since 1983! To see such divisive, one-sided, dogma proves there really isn't that much difference between the sexes...Good Show!"
3,Obviously Isn't an Academic,"While this work is well organized, the content is taken completely out of context and matched with unrelated materials throughout. At times the author will make leaps from pre-history to classical inorder to make her point...there is a obviose adgenda at work. I found myself raising my eyebrows and thinking ""where did she get that conclusion...,"" so I decided to look up some of her referances and may of them don't match (not to mention I have trouble with anyone relying on other encyclopedic matterials to support their own....depth cannot be achieved). This is a fun read, but I would be highly suspicious of anyone using it for anything with substance. I felt she was streching scholarship to support a belief system of her own - a dangerous business to be in."
4,Redefining Chick,Barbara definitely has her slant but she does allow historical truths and a collective voice to resonate with the reader. This book has strengthened a sense of detachment from the dominant historical rhetoric of today for me-- while offering a sound perspective to add to my own. A must-read for anyone interested in the marginalized yet tremendously relevant experiences of people globally.
1,Garbage...,Very little of this book is supported by history are archeology. A lot of this seems to be just the author's opinion. And much of it outright lies! Save your money.
3,Not as good as I expected,"The book had been described more or less accurately, in that it's condition wasn't exagerated. I would have liked to know that the book is coming off the binding, I probably would've chosen another copy."
2,Old MAn and the FISH!,"Old MAn and the Sea is a book that I don't highly recommend. I think that it is pretty boring but it's not bad, to be flat out BORING. It is about a grudgy old man and a humungous sword fish. This man gets dragged out to sea and gets so bored that he talks to his hands and other fish and birds. I didn't like it but I know some people who do, so be a doll and pick it up, if you're not sure about the book, at least read it to page 50. Thanks for your sweet time!"
1,horrible,This was a horrible book. Ernest Hemmingway was not a good writer... at least not in this book. It was just about an old fisherman that talked to himself and just about killed himself while trying to catch a fish. and 1/2 of the fish was eaten by sharks.
2,OK,"The book was OK. It was boring because all he did was talk to himself. Also, it was unrealistic. I mean, let's face it. A realy old man who hasn't had any sleep can NOT pull on a huge fish like that for over 24 hours!"
3,Purchased with a purpose,I love the Dominic the Christmas Donkey song and this is the CD that you can find it! The other songs are good to listen to also.
4,great gift,"I bought this for a gift. The person could not stop talking about the cook book to this restaurant, which I bought for myself. Great history here and a great Christmas gift."
5,Donkey fan,"I fell in love with the Christmas song Dominic the Donkey after hearing it on the radio. I searched everywhere to try to buy this CD, but was unable to find it. I was so excited when I finally was able to purchase it so I would be able to hear my favorite Christmas song over and over!"
4,An average book to get help,"Well as I can not find so much resources in Turkey for modelrailroading, I had been looking for such resources until I ran across these books at Amazon, one of which is Ho Railroad from Set to Scenery. It is a quick start guide book with helpful tricks and the ways to get the set to a real world. The only missing thing is, I would like to see more color photos, but the advices are the most suitable for my ideas.I can recommend this book with also the ""Basic Model Railroading"" by Kent J. Johnson (Well the general tricks are mostly the same, if you a starter like me just buy only 1-2 books and that is enough)"
5,Natural wipes,This is the third time I have ordered these natural wipes. They do what they are supposed to do. The oils used are very effective in their special properties and they do a great job of application.
3,"Good show, dissapointing DVD","The DVD is a cropped full screen instead of the source widescreen material. The cropping isn't all that bad since this early widescreen movie is barely 16:9 (if that at all.) The picture is very soft and occasionally grainy, also a disappointment since I was expecting an improvement over my recording off of TCM earlier this year. The TCM broadcast happened to be be widescreen, by the way. Also, the subtitles lack the song lyrics; there's nothing but the dialog! The new documentary is lame; more of a pat on the back to the various principles. Only James Whitmore had an interesting story to tell. Lastly, no 3-D, not even a sample.If you've got this on video somewhere else, don't buy this version."
3,No Letterboxing?!,"What possessed the powers that be to release this great film in full-screen format? The laser disc was glorious in letterbox. I suggest taping it from Turner Classic Movies. While the picture quality will suffer, the dances will gain incredible dimension since they were obviously shot with wide-screen processing in mind."
2,It Baffles Me!,"It completely baffles me why they refuse to releas this (and other movie like it) in their original 3-D format. The only good excuse would be there is no existing 3-D print, and even then, we have the technology to replicate what they did in 1953! It makes no sense at all. They'd probably make more money if they did release this movie in 3-D (the only musical in film history to be shot in that format, I might add). I really like this movie but, I will stick to watching it on Turner Classic Movies until they come out with the original format."
3,"OK, But NOT the best version","Unfortunately at the time this film was made censorship would not permit some of the best parts of the stage version to be used (nothing really objectionable just puritanical Hayes Office things that are now used in G rated films). Also, some essential plot elements were changed and parts cut. It also was filmed in 3D so that Ann Miller kicks at the camera and other ""tricks"" are used that mean next to nothing today.For the complete ""Kate"" with all the songs and plot elements check out the Broadway Revival - PBS Great Performances version. It is the REAL complete ""Kiss Me Kate"" with great performances especially Brent Barrett and the wonderful Rachael York in the leads - much better than the film version."
3,Men in tights.,"A heavily-edited and re-written version of Cole Porter's classic musical, MGM's 3-D extravaganza of 'Kiss Me Kate' manages to hold up, despite its heavy doses of Elizabethan English. The score remains superb, even after being given the mid-50's MGM treatment of over-arrangments and sanitized lyrics, and Howard Keel and Kathryn Grayson chew their scenes with appropriate zest and give their musical numbers top-notch treatment, while Ann Miller is perky and limber as ever, dancing up a storm with a young Tommy Rall. Overall an unfaithful adaptation of Porter's masterpiece, but an entertaining piece of fluff in its own right. The DVD transfer is vivid and grain-free, presented in full-frame (standard)."
3,Kiss me...,"Although I enjoyed this DVD, I really like the newer edition of Kiss Me, Kate. The costumes in this one are quite loud and the updated edition has more down-to-earth costumes."
4,Kiss Me Kate 1953,"When two squabbling ex-marrieds are cast as squabbling Renanaissance romantics in a musical ""The Taming Of the Sherew 1952"" , life imitates art , art imitates life -and it all proves no musical comedy imitates KISS ME KATE , the backstage / onstage delight from the 1948 Broadway smash and featuring 14 peerles Cole Porter (1891-1964) songs . Howard Keel (1919-2004) and Kathryn Grayson (1922- ) are the tangeled twosome So in Love despite her i hate men flashpoints . Ann Miller (1923-2003) adds heat , razzle-tap-dazzling .Zesty Choreography by Bob Foss (1927-1987) and Hermes Pan (1909-1990)Under George Sidney (1916-2002) nible direction . So brush up your Shakespeare and Enjoy . Kaste wont just Kiss you . Shell floor you !. DVD includes vintage documentary shorts : Mighty Manhattan and New Yorks Wonder city , the pure digital transfer in high resolution and enjoy both movies . Highly recommended"
4,It's a pretty easel.,"We've only had it for one day and it has withstood my 2-year-old climbing around and underneath it (because he thinks everything is a piece of playground equipment). The reason for this review is to let people know that in order to make the art trays stay on the easel (several people have complained that they easily fall off), you have to reach behind (inside) the easel and snap them on. You don't just sit them on; they snap in place. Do this and they won't keep falling off. : )"
2,Bad tray design!,"I bought this easel for my toddler because of Crayola's good reputation and attractiveness of this easel, but I was disappointed.PROS: 1) Easy to assemble, 2) Comes with magnetic letters and numbers, 3) Nice hooks to hang drawing paper, and 4) Sturdy plastic construction with rounded edgesCONS: 1) The 4 trays that are supposed to hold the magnets, drawing supplies, and paints fall off ALL THE TIME! The plastic parts that are supposed to keep the trays in place are very poorly designed and any time my child leans on them or accidentally bumps the easel, as toddlers often do, they would come crashing down. I tried double sticky tape for carpets which only worked temporarily, and finally resorted to velcro-ing the trays down. 2) No drawing supplies came with this unit - only magnets. So, be prepared to buy chalk, erase board markers, paper and crayons when you buy this easel or else your child will be disappointed that he/she cannot draw right away."
2,Not at all the best out there,"I have several easels. I host toddler art days at my house once a week. The clips on this easel aren't strong enough to actually HOLD paper :-( Also, the chalk board on the one I have doesn't really work. The chalk just slips across without drawing. It's kinda a slick (but textured) plastic surface not regular chalk board material. I DO NOT recommend this easel."
5,Great variety in product and easy to keep clean,"My daughter has used this regularly for 2 years now. I highly recommend the plastic easel vs. wood - when they paint they paint everywhere and this cleans up so easily! We just rotate the art options to keep her interested. Sometimes she's into chalk, sometimes painting, and the dry erase is fun too."
2,"Overpriced; and not a real ""black"" board!","I think this is grossly over-priced!I bought this item at ToysRUs for 45 dollars and I still think it is over-priced.The black-board is ""plastic"" hence doesn't draw well at all... Maybe the white-board is 90% use of this product.For my 2 year old, I don't want to give her markers yet, which is why I was hoping to make heavy use of the black-board part of this item for another yr... I am returning it.Might end up going for a true wooden black-board instead."
5,Best Easel for young kids...,"This product is fantastic, really enables your kid to play with both the magnetic and chalk sides. Enables they to show a lot of their artistic qualities - highly recommended and good value."
3,Chalk and Markers are not included!,"The product put together very easily, less than 2 minutes from taking out of the box it was ready to go.....except that it didn't include ANY chalk or dry erase markers! the instructions state that only a specific kind of markers and chalk should be used so you think they would include at least a starter set so that your child could play with the set immediately. Also, the letters and numbers don't have very strong magnets so they come off easily. The letters are smaller than I expected so make sure you keep them away from small children."
1,Missing double easel,We would love this item but still have not received . Second order. We are puzzled as to why. Please check for us
5,Durable easel,"Got this for my niece, she loves it. It is super durable! She loves to draw and use the magnetic letters. You could also set it up for paint, but I will let her parents get that stuff."
3,they're okay..,These are ok. I have found that the silicone components dont last or hold up well (less than 3months).The cups function well and hold up otherwise perfectly well. My recommendation would be to either buy in bulk or purchase with a supply of replacement 'nipples'. Best for 1-2yr.olds.
1,Leaks worse than any other cup!,"We've used several different kinds of sippy cups and they all can leak, but this one is UNBELIEVABLE!!!! If my son leave it on its side the entire contents will leak out. The are awful."
4,We Love this item!,My Son only drinks out of these sippy cups! They are absoultly amazing! We received this item within a week of ordering!
4,Great Product for the Price,Cups fit perfectly in my little one's hand. Hold a reasonable amount of juice/milk. Soft spout is gentle on little mouths and easy for teethers to chew on. Fits in every cup holder on the carseat and in the car.Gave it four stars because after a couple of runs through the dishwasher they leak.Pros still definitely out-weigh the cons.
3,"Durable, great colors, occasionally leaky","These are good, durable cups that can be tossed around without breakage. Theyre good for all ages and are used by my 1 and 3 year olds. The only downside is that they ten to spray a bit when knocked over - not terrible, but enough to warrant a cleanup."
3,My Son Loves It. Less Than Great In My Book.,"The soft valve built into the tip is perfect for my son who has a cleft lip and palate. He can bite down on the valve and drink. But now that he's older and has teeth, he gnaws through these things pretty quickly. The replacement valves seem to cost as much as a new cup! Cons: They're finicky to put back together after you wash them - and often leak, no matter how hard you twist the top on.These Nuby cups are easy for a child to use, but they have some design flaws that make them less than ideal from a parent's perspective."
5,Pretty good product!,This is an awesome cup to have when transfering babies from bottle to cup. They are easy to clean and my daughter had no problem gripping the cup by herself. The only downfall to this product is that they need to sell valve replacements. My daughter would chew and chew on it and I'd end up buying a new one since it would no longer be spill-proof.
2,spout is hard to use,We've tried a variety of sippy cups and these are among my least favorite. They're not bad in terms of durability and my son doesn't seem to have a problem gripping them. But the spouts have started to give us trouble. My son has to suck so hard on them that he collapses the rubbery top part. I have to constantly unscrew the lid to release the pressure and the spout pops back out. He's fine for a few minutes and then we have to unscrew the top again.We use other brands of cups with the same soft top/valves and don't have this trouble.
2,Not a good cup,Cup doesn't seem to be of very good quality. Leaks all the time. I would have gave this 3 stars but I went with 2 since you could be like me and get a pink cup for your son.
1,Horrible,I purchased this despite the negative reviews since the brand has been pretty good for me. One cup came that is absolutely not spill proof. It leaks absolutely everywhere and the nipple sinks into the cup after my daughter drinks out of it. Really wishing I would have listened to the reviews.
2,I wish I liked them....,"I initially liked these cups (and so did my daughter,) so I bought another pack of two...Unfortunately after about a week I hated everything about them. First of all, it takes some time to line the notches up to get the nipple in the ring, and once it's lined and secure, it's hard to screw the top on the cup straight. It almost always takes some adjusting. Secondly, the nipple collapses with almost every sip! I'm not sure how everyone isn't having this same problem, as I know it's not a defect in my daughters cup since we own 4 of them. I'm constantly having to unscrew the lid for her and pop the nipple back out. We use all of the NUK Gerber Graduates cups now, and I LOVE them!"
1,2 out of 3 cups broke after dropped one time,"I have always used nuby cups, have about 4 I bought over 6 months ago and they work so well.I received these 3 cups on Wednesday, the first cup was dropped by my toddler and right away it cracked and I can't use it anymore. Second cup was used today, exact same thing happened.My older nuby cups have been dropped, thrown on concrete, and pretty much gone through what a toddler can do to any item. They are still in tact and working well.These are thin versions of the nuby sippy cups I normally use and have bought (not online). I wont' be ordering sippy cups on line anymore, my lesson for trying to save money."
1,breakable,My son threw the cup and it broke immediately. The other lasted longer but quickly bit the dust after more rough play. Plastic needs to be stronger. My Munchkin cups are way more durable and I'm replacing this product with the other though slightly more expensive....I need to find a GREEN solution with recycled content but BPA free.
5,Great Product,I used the nuby no spill sipper's with my first and went right back to them with my second. She's 10 months old and loves these sippy cups. We've never had to worry about spills. I would recommend this product to anyone.
2,Worked for 3 weeks only!,"They were working ok until I washed the clear soft plastic top on (the sipper). I noticed there was dirt under it, between the soft part and the hard plastic part of the lid, and that could only be cleaned if the top (the clear part with the sipper) came off and was washed separately, which seemed ok I guess, after all Nuby should've known that it can get really nasty if we don't wash the lid parts separately. After I did that I but it back exactly like the way it was before and did all the adjustments but they kept on leaking! They leak so bad it's impossible for my baby to use it without having water pouring from everywhere. And the price wasn't too cheap either. Now I have to throw them away because they're just useless."
3,A so-so sippy!,"I got this for my son who is now 11 months. He's able to drink out of it easily, but:-The flow is quite fast.-He figured out in no time how to get the water out of the cup and on to the floor.-Sometimes the spout gets partially sucked in to the bottle and I have to release the air.It's ok. I still use it, but it's not out favorite!"
2,Constant leaks,The top of the spout is squishy so every time my son throws this cup down the spout is depressed and the cup leaks. He usually is tossing the cup at me so if I'm sitting on the couch the leak goes right for my pants. Really kind of annoying. I wouldn't buy these again. I'm shopping right now for replacements. This also makes it so you can't put liquid in it for travel. Some of our sippy cups I can toss in a bag and not worry but the spout of this one makes that impossible.
1,"Nope, they don't leak...","These lids do not leak. But the minute my child drops one from his high chair, the whole lid comes off. If he drops it hard enough, the lid comes off and the nipple insert pops out. It's very dramatic and not at all the purpose of a sippy cup. Trust me, we've tried hard, but there is NO WAY to put these lids on tightly enough that he can't perform this ""trick."""
1,Brake when they hit the floor!,"We got these because we liked other Nubby sippy cups, but needed more. We have had them about two months, always washing them on the top shelf in the dishwasher (which I guess weakens the plastic) and all of a sudden this week each one broke whenever our daughter threw it on the floor. She throws any/all sippy cups from time to time, but these are the only ones that have broken! What a waste of money if they only last 2 months."
1,Soft spout leads to big time messes!,"I bought this brand as a set of 4 at my local warehouse club thinking I was getting a great deal. My daughter started using these around 10 months and quickly learned that if she pushed in the soft spout by bouncing it upside down on any hard surface, water would spill out everywhere. She would flood the floors and her high chair tray in no time. I finally had to buy the sippy cups with hard tops again and have had no issues."
3,Tough to sip from at first + spout broken after a few weeks,"This is a popular sippy cup in our playgroup. It is generally considered one of the most spill-/drip-proof ones we've found (and we've really searched a lot!). A couple of the toddlers could not get anything out (and neither could the moms) at the beginning. However, once you pry open the holes with a needle and your toddler learns that (s)he has to almost bite it go get the liquid flowing, then it's a good cup. My toddler managed to bite a hole in the spout after a couple of weeks, so I purchased new ones at almost the same price as the cup itself. Same problem with the initial flow - nothing comes out. If you use the lid, the cup is more likely to leak."
1,I HATE THIS COMPANY,"I have been using this cup for about 7 months. The design of the cup is great. And when it works, it's fine. BUT...The spouts leak after a while or if your child chews on them. Wal-Mart has the cups for $1.79 but the replacement spouts cost at least that much plus shipping. I had been ordering the spouts from the manufacturer for 85 cents each until January but they decided to only sell them retail since the demand was so high. I wonder why?DON'T BUY THIS CUP. It's a money pit. Unless you consider $2 sippy cups disposable."
1,"Leaks, Nipple breaks, No Good","Anyone who gives this a positive review hasn't owned it very long. The spout leaks and after a few times getting chewed on, the end of the spout breaks. What a racket. The cup is $1.74 at Walmart but the spout is $1.75 on ebay. Might as well get a new cup. Lame!!!"
2,The lid suctions in after every drink!!!,"My daughter would only take this type of cup due to the soft spout, so that part was great. The problem is, after every single drink, the lid gets suctioned down and then it will leak everywhere. I either have to unscrew the lid or pull on the spout to get it to go back to normal, and that's a pain. I did buy some different Nuby cups (VERY similar in appearance) at a store and those work fine. Those are more of a ""sport"" model I think, and we love those."
2,Not really satisfied with the product,"My review focuses more on the practical aspect of the sippy cup than the way it's made. I don't have a problem with the design or color, it's just that somehow the air is not flowing as it should and as the baby sucks, the nipple shrinks in and you need to open the lid and let air go in so the nipple gets its form back. Maybe I need to poke the little hole that it has on the lid and make it bigger..."
2,Not for teething babies,"What I liked: This cup is great for transition from bottle to cup, it's leak-proof and easy to clean.What I didn't like: My son learned quickly to squeeze the mouth piece with his gums and let the liquid run out all over his shirt.We like the Playtex sippy cup best."
2,My daughter loves them . . . I hate them,"These were the only 'sippy cups' that I could get my daughter to use after stopping breastfeeding. Yet, now at 18 months, she still only wants these cups and they leak horribly and are time consuming to prepare. Even after the tedious job of lining up the notches perfectly (and the silicone spout often slips when you screw it onto the cup, so you often have to take it out and line it up all over again), we often get leaks from some other minor problem in the lid. I have to triple check every aspect of the lid to ensure no major leaks.Also, the spouts break very easily (which causes major leakage), and I have had to keep replacing them. I am desperately trying to break my daughter of these cups."
3,Great transition,"These cups were a great transition from the bottle. My daughter started using them around 7 months and did great. These cups truly do not leak. I did find the valves breaking after awhile. She still used them but the cups were no longer spill proof. Even though the valves broke, I will be inclined to buy replacements for my second child. After all, I haven't found any other cups that don't leak."
2,"Great look, but bad results!","I bought this cup for my daughter a couple days ago. I kept wondering why she was so irritated with this cup. Last night I finally tried sucking on it myself to see if liquid was even coming out and guess what...nothing! I literally had to suck extremely hard to get a couple of drops out. I am now thinking about cutting a larger opening in the silicone spout so that my daughter gets uesd to holding a cup. It will somewhat defeat the purpose of a 'no spill' cup, but at least she'll get something out of it."
2,Leaky Cup,"I like this cup because there is no valve to lose and my 2 yr old son can hold it easily. However, the lid is difficult to twist properly onto the cup and the cup leaks or if my son drops it the lid comes off. So we stopped using this cup after a few times."
4,Polish Symphonic Prog,"First up, if you'd rather have lyrics in English, purchase Angel's Dream as it is the same CD but sung in English. This CD is all in Polish. Very melodic at times with the heavy useage of flute. The guitars hang around to remind you that there is a distinct rock presence. At times the backing music reminds me of film score composer Brad Fiedel."
3,"Bruce and the band great, Sound quality poor!","This performance in Spain is further evidence ofSpringsteen and the E Street Band's incredible talent as musicians and great entertainers.Unfortunately, the sound mix was a big letdown. I mix sound for a living and for me this concert did not capture the power and soul of this fantastic band. The powerful drumming of Max Weinberg was lost somewhere in the back of the mix. The backround vocals were treated as if they were not important, also hardly audible. Even Bruce's lead vocal had very little presence.For a much more exciting and accurate mix listen to the ""Live in New York"" DVD. It is a much better representation of how this band should really sound.I don't think there is anything technically wrong with the sound on this disc, just some poor creative decisions during post production. I wonder if Bruce was as directly involved in this sound mix as he was in past recordings?"
1,This is how Bruce sounds from the lobby!!,"If you spent the night in the lobby at the concession stand, this is how the concert would have sounded. I see his lips move but I can't tell what he's saying. Max slams the snare but it sounds like he's playing with brushes. Someone keeps turning the volume up and down. What the heck is going on here? This sounds like one big mono mess! `Live in NYC' has clear sound and separation...neither of which can be said for this DVD. I got this for Christmas from my fiancé and I think we got Scrooged! Some heads should roll for this.We were lucky to see Bruce at Fenway Park this past summer, it was great, even the sound was pretty good considering that it's a baseball park not Symphony Hall. This DVD will only tarnish the memory of that night."
4,Awesome Show Average Recording,"I purchased the DVD in mid December 2010. I have always respected the Boss, especially coming from Cleveland, a city that has embraced him second only to his east coast home. I embraced the Rising and consider it one of his greatest pieces of work. I saw this tour and was excited to buy this disc. The song selection and concert is Awesome, but the recording at times can be muffled and distorted. Thus the four star rating. Still worth purchasing..."
3,"Good stuff, but disc 2 screwed up","Great show, sound so-so. Disc 2 does not work properly, there is a 800 number to call to get a replacement but number does not work from my calling area! Leaving it up to Amazon.ca to get me a good disc 2."
5,"""Are you ready!!""...YES I'AM READY!!!!!!!!!!","Bootleg quality?...2nd disc doesn't work correctly?. I'm sorry for the latter, but for the person who said this is of bootleg quality must be just trying to plant some bad press.This concert DVD captures all the excitment and raw emotion of any dozen or more Springsteen shows I've been to.The quality is so good you feel that you can almost touch Bruce's guitar. This Barcelona crowd is so pumped up that it seems that it's the last show they will ever see. The band delivers, Bruce delivers and this disc delivers a complete Bruce show from beginning to the end of pure Rock n Roll bliss."
3,"Great concert, crap DVD","Many reviewers are right - it's a fantastic concert. Bruce and co really gave it their all. The first disc is great. The second disc, however, is where the problem is. The menu function doesn't work, so you can't access the special features. I will return my copy to the shop, and wait for the second, proper, batch, if Sony ever wakes up and does something about it."
1,DEFECTIVE 2ND CD!,"I purchased my copy today and also found a defective second CD. I tried it on my DVD player as well as my PS2 and the same thing happens. There is no cursor to select the program. However, if I hit enter, the concert ultimately starts. While that would be tolerable, there is no way to access the bonus material. There's going to have to be a major recall on this one. A big disappointment!"
1,Concert Turned into a Shouting Extravaganza,"If I were the engineer or editor, I will be too embarassed to have my name down on the cover of the DVD. It is so badly mixed you can hardly hear performance, making it worse by the unrelentless noise from the overly enthusiatic crowd. At one point, Bruce have to hush them before playing his harmonica in Thunder Road.Bruce does not deserve such a shoddy production. Unless you need a momento for your attendance at the concert, this is not fit for viewing"
3,Overall This Set is Disappointing,"It's a show from relatively early in the Rising Tour . . . the Summer 2003 shows were definitely better. The audio on the DVD is only average and disc 2 is defective in many cases.This set is better than no Bruce DVD at all but definitely not the best they could offer of the 2002-2003 Rising shows that were recorded . . . here's hoping that full-length versions of some of the Giants Stadium shows that were recorded make their way to the legions of Bruce fans.So, three stars . . . the set has it's moments but just doesn't stand up to the quality of the shows later in the tour. Plus, how many more times can Bruce re-release Darkness on the Edge of Town and Prove It All Night? These two songs in particular are just worn out and are filler material these days as far as I'm concerned. With his vast body of work, you'd think he could do better than just sticking in these two songs over and over again."
3,Bruce Doesn't Dissappoint ... Audio Does,"Caught two shows during the Rising Tour... these DVDs accurately reflect the energy of the latest tour... video jumps around with multiple camera angles that while I found it really distracting in the NYC disks, for some reason it just didn't bother me as much here - I'm thinking the shot choices were better... However, I hate to say it - but the audio really has problems in 5.1... I've cranked it through a substantial HT and noticed distinct fadeouts of volume levels at sever junctures in the show...in particular the L and R front channels becomed under powered and the Center Channel fades in and out in a few spots (trust me, it's not the HT equipment)... I'm cautiously optimistic that perhaps this can be remedied in future releases of the product... I may try it in standard 2 channel to see if it sounds any better..."
4,Amazing DVD,"The only thing better was being there live.I was at two of the Giants Stadium shows in the Summer of '03 and this DVD's setlist was pretty comparable to the lists of those two shows. This DVD brought back the memories of those two hot summer nights with no problem. Some people who have reviewed the DVD complained about the sound. If you don't like crowd interaction, don't buy a live DVD. The crowd plays a huge part in ANY concert experience, and the singalongs give me chills. ""The Rising"" builds up and sets the concert up to be something amazing. Other ""Can't-Miss"" include ""You're Missing"", the always-catchy ""Badlands"", the piano solo of ""Spirit of the Night"" where Bruce catches himself messing up the lyrics, ""Night"", ""Ramrod"", and ""Born to Run"" are also amazing.I highly recommend this DVD to any Springsteen fan or fan of good music."
2,JUst something missing....,"An ok set-list - not bad video - but boy, the sound on this thing is horrendous - you can't hear bruce's vocals for anything. and the performance is not a great one - stick with LIVE IN MADISON SQUARE GARDEN unless you HAVE to have a RISING TOUR dvd - but the sound is as worse as when they aired this on CBS and you couldn't hear him - terrible, terrible, mix - and i suspect from what i did hear - that his voice was not great that nite either."
1,I could not keep this....,"I have all of Springsteen's DVD's and some ""bootleg"" video as well. I have like 50 concerts of various artists on video. I love Springsteen. But, I had to sell this back. Maybe there was a bad run, but the sound quality on my DVD was so bad, it sounded like it was recorded in a closet. It had none of the energy of the NY concert. I was really disappointed because I loved the idea of getting a complete concert. My ears work fine. My DVD did not.Anybody got an explanation for this."
3,Please release a late 70s early 80s concert!,Do any high quality concerts from the late 70s early 80s time period (prior to Born In The USA) exist on video somewhere? The dead just released a 78 show from Winterland and it's amazing! I'm hoping there is something in the vaults like that somewhere for Springsteen!
4,Pure Springsteen Exuberance,"Great fun! Like all Springsteen live performances, he puts everything into it and surely earns his pay. The music selection is great and the video coverage is complete enough that you really feel a part of the audience.The audio is pretty good, but I find at high volume, which suits this type of music, the lyrics can seem muffled. However, the spirit of the performance is infectious and the lyrics less important. So, ramp it up and enjoy!"
3,Was this recorded underwater?,"Having seen the Cleveland and Pittsburgh shows on the Rising tour and loving the NYC DVD I was jazzed for this one. Unfortunately, the sound stinks. If you experiment with some of your receiver's digital signal processing settings you can pump it up a little bit but that is an artificial solution that you should not have to do. All the more tragic in that you can tell the band was really on that night and the fans were into the show. At the beginning of Badlands, you can see Bruce's hand do the signature slide down the neck of the guitar but you sure can't hear anything. The sound is just awful.Buy it as a momento of a classic tour but don't expect too much. The PCM 2 channel stereo actually sounds a little better than the surround. Some tin eared engineer deserves to be fired over this one."
2,Sound mix is very bad,"I've only watched this DVD twice in over a year. The second time I had to force myself. I have a nice surround sound system, not the best but nice, and the vocals were especially too heavy compared to the music. It's a very bad mix overall. Not full and rich sound at all. I was very excited to get the DVD after viewing the Live in New York City DVD. Now that's a wonderfully produced and mixed DVD. The sound is awesome on the NYC DVD. Stay away from this one unless sound quality is not that important or you just want it to fill up your collection."
4,Here's my problem...,"The 1st disc was great. I tried to play the 2nd disc but the disc would not respond to my remote. I couldn't get to the documentary or individual performances. I tried other dvd's and they all worked fine. The 1st disc was fine too! Thinking this was maybe a defect, I exchanged it....the same thing happened! I am so looking forward to seeing the 2nd disc. Suggestions?3 years later: Weeks after writing this review I found out Sony was aware of the problem and they exchanged the one disc for me..it was a quick and seamless interaction. It just took me this long to getting around to update the review.Great concert!"
3,"OK, if you know the lyrics already.","This concert was a love fest between audience and performer(s), but I was disappointed in the DVD. Only after I printed out the lyrics (from the internet) was I able to understand what he was saying, even though I'd heard about half the songs before. Screaming and mumbling, often seemingly intoxicated, he gets by on charisma rather than getting a message across. It will be a long time, if ever, before I play this DVD again."
2,Great DVD,If you want to hear the Boss say bad things about the America on Foreign Soil. Other than that the sound quality is terrible. The video is good but not as good as Live in New York.
4,cute for the aspiring ballerina,"My almost 3 year old loves anything to do with princesses and ballerinas--hence this book. I've seen better drawings, colors, but it's ok---not all books can be as colorful as RoliePolieOlie books & Little Einsteins.Nice change."
4,More of the same,"Same kindergarten grandchild, same review asbefore, just a different title. Have nowpurchased book ends for her to keep themon a shelf in her bedroom, away from youngerbrother' reach."
2,Not as good as its other title,Guide for the Advanced Soul came out first and was fantastic. This book follows up and is disappointing with quotes that don't have much impact like the first book. Sounds like a case of the sequel not being as good at the first one. Went to a friend.
1,Never Again,"Well, I never received my package. I was told I'd get a refund, I have yet to see that either.I guess, what people say on Amazon is not real. I will never order from Amazon again. I will never give a good review or suggest it to anyone I know, I will do just the opposite."
5,LOVE IT,"Good coffe table book or airplane/traveling book.If you like physics and are interested in how everyday happenings work, you will enjoy this book.I purchased my copy at an airport bookstore. And <3 it."
5,Detailed Guidebook.,"I'm a new recruit, and as far as I can tell, this book details everything worth knowing and more about the Air Force and its standards. I'm glad to have picked this up before heading out to basic training. I get the impression that most of what you learn (non-physically) at basic and beyond will serve as a reinforcement to what this book teaches you."
2,Not Helpful,"As a new AF wife, I picked this book along with the AF Officers Guide in hopes of getting a clear picture of military life, jargon and expectations. It was completely unhelpful."
1,Gillette M3 Power Nitro Razor,"stoped working after 5 days, it does not worth mailing it back to return, mailing cost a lot. that is how they sell thier junk i wish I bought it from local storeGillette M3 Power Nitro Razor"
3,Pretty good but question choice of actors,"I had just read the book and wanted to see the movie. Overall I liked the way it was done. I know you can't fit a whole book into a 2-hour movie without changing a few things, and I think they did a pretty good job of keeping the story straight. Most of the characters were believable EXCEPT I really took issue with Emma Thompson as Elinor - I'm sorry, she is just WAY TOO OLD! She would have been better as Mrs. Dashwood, who, if you remember from the book, was in her 40's and still attractive. The other actor that bothered me was Alan Rickman as Col. Brandon. In the book he seemed to be a softer, more genial character, but Alan Rickman's portrayal was too harsh (and his looks are a tad harsh - I don't think he smiled once in the whole movie, except maybe in the last scene). So ... I would recommend it but whith those caveats."
3,Good features/Average quality,"I ordered this MP3 player based on features, long battery life, and good reviews. Luckily, I haven't had any of the technical problems others have listed, but I'm underwhelmed with the sound quality of this player. Voice recording is muffled and can be hard to understand with built-in mike and refused to record at all with a powered external mike. FM reception ok, but I've heard better on other MP3 players. Fairly easy to navigate and seems to be solid build. Ok, but not great, player."
1,Hard to use,"This mp3 player is small, but heavy when you are wearing it. When you run if bounces around because of the weight. I had trouble downloading music and using the little joystick to select options. I am buying a ipod nano in 2 days because I need an mp3 player that is user friendly. I can say their customer support is great because I had to call them to get them to help me with the down loading of music. I owned a Rio cali before and it was very simple to use - unlike this mp3 player."
2,Poor Quality,I loved this player until it failed to boot.This little player has great sound and useful features. I used to about 3 months and it no longer boots. It will go through the flash screens and then hang showing the free memory.This is the second MP3 player this summer. The last one that failed was a SanDisk.Who makes an MP3 that does not fail?
3,Looks good but doesn't perform well,Specs are great but after couple of runs it gets stuck at 40% progress bar even with new batteries. Not sure whether it is because I received new or refurbished one.
1,Returned two players.,"Had to return two players. I went to Samsung website to check if there were any firmware updates available for the YP-MT6X player and there were two; one version was 1.101 and the other 2.121. So, I installed the software provided by Samsung to upgrade the firmware to version 2.121 (downloaded from Samsung website). I plugged the player and started the update process. Everything seemed to be ok. When I unplugged the USB cable the player would no longer turn on. I had the same exact problem with the second player. I contacted Samsung customer support, they were of no use; I was told to send the player to them for service. If you buy this player, DO NOT UPGRADE FIRMWARE to version 2.121 or you will have problems."
5,Fantastic Portable Fun!,"This was a smart purchase, on my part. I had asked some friends about their MP3 players and had gotten a variety of opinions and advice, the best being to check out Amazon.com for advice and prices. I have moved music on & off of my player with ease. I have listened to the radio and surfed my music collection, all while working out. This player is easy to use and incredible fun!"
1,Don't bother with Audio version at $130+,"I thought that it was a mistake since it listedfor $59.99, is eighteen years old, deals with a subject that has not changed in decades and is available in book form for less than two dollars. At more than twice list price I'll pass on this one and you should too.Additionally you can get the 2004 revised edition for less than $50 new. Here's the ISBN: - 0976076500"
4,Awsome,"This band started out in Nashua,New Hampshire.I was little and did'nt know my neighbor was the guitarist for them.Although now i relised they made some amazing music with a Korn sound to it.Heavy and good,i highly reccamend this for any metal head.(Though this album has alot of distortion making the guitar hard to here at times a little harder then most metal bands.)Don't think of this as generic think of it as a good first attempt."
1,Alma goes on the Turbo Diet,"Terrible!!! Are you willing to go on a liquid diet for 2 weeks that consists of some expensive mixture from a health food store and the water from steamed veggies??? If you are, then you are as crazy as I was to buy this stupid book. Plus, you spend one day that you cannot leave home due to the laxatives you must take. He says it is a permanent weight loss, but you must be very careful to eat a very well-balanced diet afterwards. Same song, second verse. This diet even sounds dangerous. Don't waste your money!!"
2,Not much sculpting info in this video!,"I purchased this thinking it would have some information about ""Sculpting with Welding"" but it is basically a beginning welding tutorial. There is lots of info on How to weld, weld types, shop safety and cutting procedures but they left out the sculpting stuff save a couple of quick comments about texturing metal and a 5 min segment watching him make a sculpture. I am glad I did not purchase the 2nd of the series too!"
2,Boring and tired.,I have no idea how this could be called 'essentials'. It's just JF's idea of what an orchestrated practice should be. Not my favorite. There's no brochure that describes the postures or the procedures.
3,could be better,"There are two main problems with this phone...the buttons are set high so that they are pushed by accident easily, ie, if you use your shoulder and chin to hold the phone. Also, the programming function is not so easy. (One shortfall, can't use the * key in storing numbers if you want to unblock your number because it is also the exit key.)The good things about the phone is the room monitor, intercom and the ease of transferring calls. Also, there are three handsets, which is good.I haven't used the answering system.Overall, the clarity is pretty good, the range just okay for a 5.8, the features good for my needs, but I find the buttons really bothersome..My last phone was an old Sony 2.4ghz and I loved it...it wore out and couldn't find another...And would like to say that I have never had any problems ordering with Amazon, and their customer service is great!!"
3,"Good product, but needs revision","I bought this phone expecting better reception and range, but did not see any improvement at all. Only major complaint is that the keypad does not light up like previous GE models I had bought.I like the ""do not disturb"" button on the base that turns off all ringers.Overall good product, but can be improved."
2,No battery life and not very far range. Waste of money!,"We bought this phone about a year ago because of the ability to have just one phone hooked to phone jack and still have two additional phones in other rooms. That part is great until the battery life weakens more and more until you have a phone whose battery no longer works. We cant even talk on one of the phones more than half an hour now until it beeps to say charge battery, and one of them has a battery that is completely dead. None of this would be much of a problem if you could buy a new battery right? Well they do not make a replacement battery for this phone so you are stuck with a really abd phone or going out and buying more again. This phone also does not have very far range distane either. We cant go in our garage, which is attached to the house, without it becoming scratchy."
3,"Nice sound quality, poor battery life--GE..generally exhausted","I have had this phone for one year. I bought it because of the lightness of the receiver, the sound quality and the GE name. Unfortunately, the battery life is quite poor. I had a Panasonic for two years and it took many days and a lot of usage before the low battery signal came on. Unfortunately, Panasonic's products are poorly made and die after less than two years. Maybe this is the planned obsolescence of all cordless phones. But, you will find after two or three months, that the battery charge lasts less than one day or will be used up after a fifty minute chat. Buyer Beware."
4,Pretty much what is says it is........,My only complaint with this product is in the answering system. When you retrieve the messages the process you go through is to long for me. There is an announcer that speaks and gives a lot of unnecessary information before the message is played to you. It just takes to long to get your messages. Other than that the product is great. Great reception and clarity.
2,The handset speaker and microphone STINK,"Don't expect anyone to be able to understand you or for you to understand them while talking on this handset. If you want to sound like Charlie Brown's teacher, this is the means by which it can be accomplished. The answering maching part works fine- I keep it just for that purpose."
1,Beware!,"Description says it has ""all the most popular features."" Wrong! Only one handset can be used at a time--no 3-way calling! If you are on the phone with Grandma, the kids can't get on another handdset and talk with her. This is not spelled out in any of the promotional material--it is only covered on the last page of the owner's manual."
3,La distancia de alcance es muy pobre,"Tengo instalada la base del telefono en la sala de mi casa, y tengo una extension en mi habitación, cuando cerramos la puerta la señal se pierde, si me muevo muy lejos de la base tambien se pierde la señal o empieza a tener fallos. Realmente el rango de alcance es muy debil y no me ha gustado.Por otro lado, la presentación del equipo es muy buena, las funciones son excelentes, lo unico malo es que no tiene una bateria para mantener la memoria de la hora y el dia en la contestadora, ya que si hay un fallo en la energia electrica o se desconecta la fuente de voltaje se borra la fecha y la hora y hay que estar reprogramandolo cada vez que uno lo mueve o le va a hacer alguna limpieza."
1,"A tiny, worthless paperback","My primary reason for writing a review of this tiny book is help others avoid wasting money on this. The book is approximately 5x3"" with fewer than 100 pages. The pictures are absolutely awful. Most are rendered in low-contrast black and white, such that there is very little visual information. The are four color images of similarly low quality. Accompanying these ""pictures"" is a collection of poetry fragments that attempt to describe the pictures in the typically trite, simplistic manner one might expect from this sort of thing. If you're not buying this for the images, you're buying it for wrong reasons. If you ARE buying this for the images, forget about it. It's like someone printed this on an old dot matrix printer using newsprint."
5,Brilliant Recasting of the Tradition,"This book is a great entry point into Brandom's vast and expanding philosophical system. I actually read it after Making it Explicit, Articulating Reasons, Between Saying and Doing, and Reason in Philosophy, and it allowed me to appreciate Brandom's thought from a whole new angle, the classic modern works all translated into his vocabulary. Of particular interest are the essays on thinkers Brandom does not discuss in his major publications, namely Spinoza, Leibniz and Heidegger."
4,Humor from a time when it didn't have a hard edge,"Some of these jokes are classics that you probably have heard before, but like all classics, they bear repeating. They are what many people would consider old school humor, where being funny was not based on an uninterrupted stream of swear words or on the brutal ridicule of others. It was based on developing an incongruous situation and ending with a punch line that ""resolved"" the inconsistencies. I read it with pleasure; it was a reminder that humor can be based on more than stories with a hard edge."
5,This is the BEST pan ever! A fabulous buy for the money!,"I chose to purchase this after reading many other reviews on amazon.com. I was desperate to find a pan large enough to cook for a crowd of 19 for Christmas dinner.The clean up was FABULOUS and very, very, easy!!!It is so spacious that we were able to cook TWO spiral hams in the rack at the same time (one 15lbs and the other 10lbs) and we had 7 lbs. of potatoes underneath for roasting.We could not have done such a large Christmas dinner without this sturdy pan. The handles allow it to accommodate several pounds of food that the deep sides keep inside.A fabulous buy for the money!"
2,I don't like it,"I just don't like this product. It is really large , way to large for average roast and we are family of four. All juices collected at the bottom always burn in it because the bottom is to big and it makes the juices to be very shallow & evaporate too fast. Excuse my English, I'm from Poland. The other down side is that the pan is not induction suitable, (magnet don't stick to the bottom), so I can't transfer it to my induction stove to make the gravy. It would be more easy to clean if it wasn't that big."
2,Read it as an example of how science should not be studied,"Unfortunately the arguments are supported by invented facts.The book uses isolated incidents as ""proof"" and ignores the facts about what is really occuring on our globe.A point being that overall ""globally"" glaciers are growing but the book only focuses on individual examples of melting glaciers.This is not science."
1,Fast and Loose Facts don't equal Truth,"It's hard to know where to start to demolish this shaky structure! Perhaps the foundation? The plain truth is that there is no global warming evident during the past 100 years when anthropogenic forces should have really been at their worst. Carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has more than doubled in that era, but the earth cooled a tiny bit! The only thing I can say is that one robin does not make a spring and a few years of [what seems to short-lived humans!] extra warmth or drought or rain or cold does not constitute a trend in climate. Back off a bit and look at thousand year cycles if you want to know about climate. Lynas has done a good job of finding the ""low-hanging fruit"" that always gets picked first, but he certainly has not investigated and used his brain to analyze data and reach adult conclusions. File this book with the rest of the fables such as Chicken Little and the Falling Sky. It doesn't rate any stars at all!"
2,Misguided (complex liner notes that must belong to another CD),"Rhythms can transport you to another place. They can be complex or simple. Each will affect you differently, if you choose to listen careful and let them embrace you. This CD offers simple rhytms, but they do not embrace or transport you, they merely irritate. If you have a youngster learning to play the drums, these sounds will be familiar. (And what is this DVD labeling? My copy was audio CD only)."
4,What software problems?!,I run Fujitsu notebook running XP Pro and Cannon S50 Camera with my new samsung yh-925gs. I installed just the Driver from the site and use media player 10 to sync audio. Photos I just drop in the upload box in the HD. No problems here. Driver and WM10 thats all I need. No samsung software needed!Cheers.Mookie
2,Awful customer care.,"I regret the day I decided to buy the YH-925. I'm a foreigner visiting the US and I bought the YH-925 for my son. Coming back to my home country, I found out that I cannot register the Napster in order to import the MP3 files from my computer. The thing is that NOBODY CARES TO TELL YOU THAT NAPSTER CAN ONLY BE REGISTERED IN THE US. Not on the box, not on any documents inside! Please understand my frustration and my boy's tears. You faithfully paid for a product and you never thought that Samsung could treat you like that.I finally found out that I can get around Napster by using WMP10 but the thing is that you paid too much money, too much time, too much energy for a total neglection of Samsung. Furthermore, the sound is so bad. I had Creative Jukebox Zen once and it sounds much better than the YH-925.Let me assure you: you definitely don't need YH-925."
1,"Do not buy. Hard to use, limited customer support","I am not going to fool with this difficult to use MP3 player. I have installed the driver and uninstalled it many times. I have tried to manually install the driver using the instruction. Nothing works. Looks really nice, but setting up is difficult."
1,Terrible MP3,"I bought this quite some time ago and it was just awful! It would play maybe 5 songs and then die, even with the battery fully charged! Heaven forbid you try and navigate the menus while listening to the device! Couldn't even complete one song if you did that! This MP3 quickly found its way into a drawer and has disappeared since (good riddance). I bought a Zune 30gb about a month later and never looked back. I am now using the Zune HD 32gb and am quite happy (as I got it on major clearance!!). Do NOT buy this MP3, even if it only costs you $1!"
1,CRAPPY!!!!!!!,"Initially I loved this item. But as time went on the love faded, really fast. After a few months the battery life became less and less. I initially purchsed this to record my lectures, and it did a fantastic job, for a while. Then after a year of having it the internal flash stopped working. This made it completely inoperable because I wasn't able to access the various functions. I called Samsung customer service and they were not helpful at all. This is the last Samsung item I will ever buy. I didn't want to give this thing one star, if I could I would give it negative stars for wasting my time and hard earned money."
1,"tedious, boring, 300 pages too long",This book goes on and on and on. I seldom give up on a book and read the ending but this one was really boring as it seemed to go on forever and the ending was somewhat obvious. The whole bunch of them needed a good therapist and should have gone for a group rate.
1,crappy speakerphone quality,STAY AWAYI bought this phone because a good % of my life is spent on conference calls. The speakerphone quality is awful -- 70-80% of the time I can barely hear the folks on the other end of the line even with the volume turned up all the way and my ear right up against the speaker.
2,Its ok,I always like a phone with speaker option.. so I choose this as its from GE and it has 5.8 GHz thinking that it will b really great to use speaker as well as cordless together.. but when I called my friends with the speaker phone option they started complaining that the voice is not clear or its breaking very badly.. and this is still going on.. and im very disappointed with this.. i never took my phone very far from its base so it shouldnt give any prob but im having this prob other than this phone looks great.. features r little confusing.. as it donest have on/off or red/green button to rec also same button and to dissconnect also same button...overall an average product not upto my expectation.. sorry!!!
3,Low outgoing sound,People I talk to on this phone always tell me they cannot hear me. It's hard to have an easy conversation when you always need to speak up. The other phones in my house work fine. Speaker works good though.
3,Unusual Movie. This is not for everyone.,"This is a very unusual movie. I picked it up because it had an interesting cover in the video store and really enjoyed it. But this is not a video for young people or those who are easily offended. There is violence, and there is implied sex, although I do not remember any really overt sex scenes. And, since this is the story of a 16 year old girl sold into a Turkish harem in the 1600's, sex, at least implied is pretty much a given.All in all, it is a good movie."
1,Not for capped teeth!,"Extremely hard-not our favorite. We have always been pleased with Ener-G foods, but this was a bitter disappointment."
3,Chewy and a little flavorless,"It's not easy having a young child with multiple food allergies. The up side to these pizza shells is that I can make him a pizza. The downside is they're a bit chewy and don't have the best flavor. I didn't expect much since they're gluten/dairy/egg/yeast free, so I was pleasantly surprised. Be careful not to overcook, they do get REALLY crispy."
2,"Not as good as, they use to be.","Last year we ordered this item, not in bulk, directly from Ener-G-foods, and they were great. Last year they arrived frozen, this time they arrived defrosted and not packed as well. The taste was bland and the texture was not as light and crispy."
5,Simply the best there is!!!!!,"I have used this book for over 25 years and still come back to it every time, that someone has a question about trees. It gives clear concise descriptions of not only the leaves, but bark and twigs. It has many trees in it that other books omit, and I find that is many times a fairly common tree that is overlooked.My daughter used the book for High School Biology, now my 14 yo son is using it and younger son is using it in his life science course."
4,Excellent Reference Material!,"The information is sound and proven. It is a very easy to reference guide and is easily organized. It's also a relatively pocket-sized book which makes it excellent for carrying in the field (where it can be best put to use anyway).The only downsides are that the book's content is about 60 years old so all of the pictures are in black and white. That and the pages are done in regular paper instead of something glossy. Consequently, if you take it in the field with you a lot, the pages will get dirty fast. If they'd simply do a full-color revision on some glossy paper stock it'd get the full five stars."
4,Or Buy The Lamplit Answer Instead?,"For me the best of the three books collected in Supernatural Love was her middle book, The Lamplit Answer, from 1985. This contains the fascinating retelling of Sleeping Beauty, ""Imaginary Prisons,"" and the wonderful poem ""Sonata"" which frames almost the perfect vortextual line ""But I'm not Milton, nor was meant to be."" In nine words this line conjures the spirits of Eliot, Shakespeare and of course Milton. I found all the poems in section II through IV of this book highly relevant (The Chopin poems which comprise section I were a little too encyclopedic for me.) The poems from A Gilded Lapse of Time show an evolution in her style away from metrical and toward free verse, and after the title poem, a homage to Dante in true Bloomian style, the rest are concentrated on religious texts and art, not areas I find hugely motivating."
5,Please re-release this on CD!!!!!,"I wish the record company would release this and put an end to the money hungry, heartless sharks who will screw you out of $99.00 for this.....am not saying that it isn't a great CD...because it is......I just refuse to pay an obscene amount for any cd....because just about the time you do.....they will release it for regular price.I hope these people who feel they can justify screwing somebody out of $99.00 for a CD....can live with themselves....If it's such a GREAT cd...why are they so willing to part with it?"
5,One of the best books of Spanish poetry,"Excelent translation. Like ""Eagle or Sun"", ""A Draft or Shadows"" is the best Paz's poetry. Without doubt, some of the best poems I have ever read. East and West, Water and Stone, White and Black... encounter each other... on the other side."
5,Fun!,"I love this! It is lots of fun! I love how Fang pops out of the door when you spin the chair! It includes Hagrid,{of course} and harry. A great purchase!"
5,Great Live Tucker,"STOMPIN' ROOM ONLY is a great live Marshall Tucker album that's the equal of the live portion of WHERE WE ALL BELONG. The CD features cuts from several shows recorded between 1974 and 1976, but they all form a unique whole. If you love WHERE WE ALL BELONG, BRING IT BACK ALIVE, ONE MORE FROM THE ROAD, GREATEST HITS OF THE OUTLAWS/HIGH TIDES FOREVER, BEST OF THE OUTLAWS: GREEN GRASS AND HIGH TIDES, The Outlaws' PLATINUM AND GOLD COLLECTION, and all of the studio albums by Skynyrd, the Outlaws, and Marshall Tucker, you'll love STOMPIN' ROOM ONLY."
4,Stompin' good music,"This collection is 11 songs from 1974-1976 and consists of live performances from Milwaukee, WI, Murfreesboro,TN, and London & Manchester, England. Outstanding collection with great extended instrumentals on all the songs. All Marshall Tucker Band fans will love this one."
4,More!!!,"One of the GREAT bands that never got its due. While some of this material has been previously released, here it is done so within the context of other live material spanning the bands most productive era. I am NOT a fan of re-releasing material already on another CD, but for me, this one time, I am not only overlooking that fact but enjoying it."
3,"nice, but.......","As nice as it was hearing the band together on this cd I would have really liked to have all of the concert from Where We All Belong relased. As many times as I have listened to it I never tire of it, the whole show would be a welcome addition to my collection"
5,A very important book on ancient India,Challenges old notions regarding ancient Indian history and makes a powerful case for a new view based on new archaeology and literary analysis. A MUST BUY for any lover of Indian history!
3,"well researched ,persuasive, and convincing book","David Frawley has categorically explained his arguments. His approach is lucid and clear.It is apparent that he has done a lot of research on this and I am glad there are scholars like him doing this kind of work. I believe anyone who is interested in understanding Ancient Indian history should read this book. Of course the idea proposed by him may seem controversial to some,but it is well worth understanding his arguments..they are very substantial and have far reaching implications. Anyone who is interested in Indian history should read this interesting book."
4,Memories of a war hero,"A gripping memoir of a Vietnam Forward Air Controller (FAC) that dramatically describes what it's like to fly low and slow over the jungle in a light plane that's vulnerable to fire from anything bigger than a slingshot. Elser, a highly decorated pilot, tells the story without ever bragging. Addressed to his son, the memoir goes on to tell what happens later in life, when combat becomes a frightening memory tinged with guilt and remorse. How Elser resolves the conflicts and describes ""what's it all about"" is a memorable and worthwhile read."
3,"Looking to turn ""Silver"" back to ""Silver""",I bought a right with immediately began to fade. So I am looking for a product that can turn my ring back to its original color. Not to dark and it turned to be a nice match of light silver that the ring originally was
4,rather well done,"Laura Antonelli (Malizia) stars as Maria, who 15 years earlier as a 15-year (I think) old fell for an older man who took advantage of her innocence and dumped her. Finally 15 years later and still in love and infatuated, she finds him, moves into a nearby apartment, and sets a trap (another title for this film is La Gabbia (The Trap)) so he cannot escape her again. He is a very uncooperative prisoner. But then her young daughter, a willing accomplice, then falls for him as well. Realistic in that it is the jerks of the world that women fall for. In view of what happens, those who consider this film worthless are more likely to be men than women."
1,BEWARE,"BEWARE!! IT IS NOT ""WIFEMISTRESS"", in spite of the same name of the principal actress - Laura Antonelli. it is a totally different movie, even though it somehow mimmics the original Wifemistress."
1,Worthless,"No need for details, this movie is total garbage. Lousy plot line if any. Unattractive actors. Terrible film to DVD transfer.Spotty audio. A total waste of time and money"
3,Decent watch to buy,"I bought this as a gift for my dad. Its a nice decent gift, the only problem was the dial, dial of this watch is quite bigger than it appears on screen. Except this one problem...nice one for who like bit bigger dial"
4,"pricey for its quality overall, yet very ergonomically agreeable","though it has shape good to allow ergonomical fit or snugginess around the child, it does come w/ a harness that is average, if not a tad unfriendly. Quality at first glance is more than any lesser brand w/ a similar price tag. You would expect more sturdiness in the material at this level called ""Elite""; but it'd slightly disappoint you, the build quality is rather barely above standard. I rate it 4 stars for its ergonomics and hollow seat that caves in, whereas other brand do not have this. I would recommend it to all nevertheless, albeit its price and disappointing build quality."
1,very disapointed,"when you buy a car seat at a store you have the opportunity to check the manufacture date and decide for yourself if it suits you. when you buy online you depend on the sellers integrity. I was very disappointed to receive a one year old! car seat, without the instruction booklet, without inner wrapping, already assembled...and the most disappointing thing is that I wrote to the sellers costumer service and did not receive any answer, or at least sending me the instruction book.I won`t buy again from this seller."
4,Michael Jackson,I purchased this dvd to have record of a great artist. I am glad to have been alive while an artist of Michael Jackson's caliber was performing. It's too bad that he left us so early.
3,Part II History on Film Review,"Video is simply a remake of MJ videos which I'm okay with, however, you can get these on other DVDs. Enjoyed MTV footage but I've seen this same footage in other tapes of MJs so it isn't anything new. Extremely disappointed in ""Blood on the Dance Floor"". Song is redone against a RAP song. Why in the world someone would choose rap music on an MJ song is confusing to me. MJs name doesn't even show up on the credits (not surprising). Also, the CD is not labeled at all which makes me wonder if its ""home-made"". I thought I was purchasing an original MJ DVD. Guess the jokes on me! Will not buy from this source again."
5,no brainer,"Well, it's a no brainer to have all the MJ videos. You either loved his music, his dance, or both so this is a must have!"
5,Great item ...,Michael Jackson is the best entertainer the world has ever known. I am glad to own this collection of his talent on film.
4,Michael Jackson,Great addition to my video collection - MJ turned music videos into a theatrical art form!
3,Michael Jackson's History II,"The cd was received in good timing. However, the cd looks like a copy. I thought I would get an original cd with pictures and info on Michael Jackson like most dvd's and cd's have."
1,NOT for children,"So....I bought this for my 9 year old son for Chrsitmas becuase he is a very musical little boy in song and dance. Who better to see than Michael Jackson? I was so very wrong. Side A was awesome, however when we started to watch side B a whole different Michael Jackson image appreared. The one I wanted to ""protect"" my 9 year old from. The worst was with his sister Janet, who in this video was grabbing her breasts, flipping everyone off into the Camera, and standing in front of a toilet as if to ""pee"" like a man. I don't care WHAT the twisted message was trying to convey, my son and I were appauled. After that, was a video of Michael rising from a pond with angel wings attached to his back as we watch him emerge from the water. So....what's wrong with THAT picture. Both the first DVD and this version is ""Not Rated"", but I will not risk buying the first one after that shock attack!!!! Certainly wish that I could get my $$ back for this one!!!!!! Absolutely disgusted!"
2,Slow shipping.,"Even though this seller wasn't the cheapest, I bought based on being close to my home. But DVD didn't arrive until third week, no way did they ship within two days, but because they ship using third rate postage(presorted standard), there's no postmark to see what day it was mailed. DVD was fine."
2,A copy of a copy,"Took a long time to be delivered, after receivceing the DVD I found that it was a copy of a copyThe face of the DVD is blank...no name os artist or songs that are on the disk and plus there was noreturn label or information how to return this item........boy do I feel ripped off"
5,STILL KING OF POP!!!!!!!!!!!,"WOW!you would think from a singer that han't written anything since ""Blood on the Dance Floor""wouldn't be popular anymore but the king is back this movie will tell you why some of his best song videos are on here including some rare ones even if your not a MJ fan this video would change your mind in my opinon I give it 5 STARS!!!!!"
4,Michael's History,I enjoyed Michael's History dvd my favorite video is Scream that was my whole reason for buying this dvd. Michael and Janet are great together.
4,Where's Leave Me Alone?,"Wish this DVD included Leave Me Alone, which is only available on Moonwalker. When will Moonwalker be release on DVD here in the States? Probably really soon...."
5,This is one of the best musical video tapes I've ever seen,This is a great movie!!!Mickael really shows his great music and moves in this video. It is a great musical video tape. A must see for any Jackson fan!
3,good selection and shocking Motown lipsynch,Good selection of Jackson's hit videos. The Billie Jean performance at the Motown Anniversary clearly indicates while the dancing was live - the King of Pop was lip synching ... no way was he singing!
5,He truly is the King of Pop!!,"This video collection re-proves his title. It contains some rather riveting videos, and some that are just plain cool. From the space adventure of ""Scream"" to the dramatic ""Earth Song"", the cassete has it all. A must have for fans!"
2,Don't get it if you're a true fan,"Okay, first off I've seen everything on this video already. If you're a true fan, this didn't do anything for you. I know I know what about the intro with the troops and showing the big statue like on the cover. Well, that was shown on t.v. to promote the history c.d. Also, the Billie Jean live from motown had the ending cut off. If you watched it back then, you'll get the three songs performed instead of just billie jean. there are a lot of his videos here. no remixes though like they've been shown on t.v. such as the megamix history i guess with a mixture of all his songs. Ummm the Smooth criminal video was cut down a couple of minutes from the original. The Teaser is about ten years old by the way!"
2,Could Be BETTER!!!!,"I will keep this review short & sweet!! The content of this DVD is AWESOME (music & videos), while the DVD itself sucks!! I hate DVDs that are mono-layered!! In other words, you have to turn the DVD to see another half of material!! Why everything wasn't on a single sided DVD is beyond me because it isn't impossible with only 106 minutes of content!! Get this used or extremely cheap on Ebay!!!"
2,does not work on computer,I actually like the material on this DVD -- BUT it does not work on a computer. It has some kind of copy protection. Then it would not eject from my mac mini.
1,hp Laser 3320 is junk,"I own this piece of junk. I bought it over a year ago. I wanted a printer/copier/scanner that would work with a Mac OS X operating system. HP said it would work. It doesn't. The thing crashes my Mac, which is ordinarily not that easy to do. HP is in no hurry to develop a program that will work with a Mac either.In addition, the thing has now developed a mechanical problem in the scan mechanism. They don't publish a manual so I can fix it. I can't even figure out how to get the thing apart to fix it. HP provides absolutely no usable service support.Don't waste your money on this thing."
1,what.,"this book was severely lacking of the letter ""e"". maybe the author should have included the letter ""e"" more often."
2,This book is fake,"This book is such a rip off of The Great Gatsby one of my favorite books of all time. It's so obvious, the guy's name is Gatsby. Also this book claims to not use the letter E, but it uses the letter E. They're trying to mislead us, but I wont fall for it. They use the letter E in the title when they state his name ErnEst VincEnt Grant.This novel is obviously part of some commie plot to take us over, don't fall for it guys. The Motherland still lives!"
2,Not the best,"This was a very low quality book. The pages were cheap feeling paper, and the cover was very grainy looking. Like if you stretch a picture on a computer. I would look for a higher quality book if I were you. The size of the book was weird. It looks more like a college text book than a novel."
4,Gadsby,"This book is totally worth reading if you're interested analysing in how he managed to write a novel without using the letter ""e"", but by god don't read it hoping for a good story - Wright was a terrible writer."
1,Terrible quality,It's proportionately wrong to feel like a proper book. Cover looks like they stretched out the image on MS Paint and the paper is extremely low quality. If they had kept it the size of an average book it would be decent but it's uncomfortable to read and feels as if you're reading an 8th graders math workbook. They made it so large that and thin that it looks like a child's picture book. There are no marks that tell you where the introduction ends and the real story begins or anywhere marking new chapters. Incredibly disappointing.
4,great m tucker disc,"back before they got cheesy, back when they could rock, back when they had all their personnel...this was what real southern rock sounded like...enjoy it...a different flavor from the allman brothers, but also an essential part of american musical history...very cool stuff..."
2,Marshal Tucker Band,"I heard a track of the Marshal Tucker band in a bar in UK.I really liked that track, so I bought this CD on the strength of it.However, the CD was not quite what I was expecting and rather disapointing. Too 70'ish for my liking.Perhaps it might grow on me ??"
1,Nightmare experiance with AT&T,"I was an AT&T customer, never again after this experiance. Switched service and am not looking back. All hardware and plans were returned and canceled. The customer service from Amazon was great and I will continue to shop at Amazon."
3,Okay plan. Other companies offer better service and more minutes,"Liked the plan when I first got it, but the supplementary products (unlimited text, data plans) are very expensive and the number of minutes expire too quickly. I personally would not recommend it. Do your research and then make a decision."
1,HYPE NO MORE,"Geez.. I think other reviewers may be hyping this band.. or they are family members of April Sixth, because based on this EP they are NOT the next big thing. The bands heart may be in the right place but where are the songs? No real hooks, little drive, thin guitars and forgettable singing puts this in the recycle bin."
5,Speakers,"Very quick and excellent service. Item came much faster than expected, in days. Very satisfied with their service. Would do business with again."
4,WILL SERVE PURPOSE,THIS ITEM APPEARS THAT IT WILL SERVE IT'S PURPOSE WELL. WE HAVE NOT USED THE UNIT IN FOUL WEATHER AS OF YET BUT IT LOOKS GOOD
3,Threaded collar needed to be glued,The locking collar that screws behind the unit had too loose threads = the unit pulled out with my lighter plug. Not the end of the world because I used JB Weld to glue it in. Just seems silly to produce the unit then not go to the trouble of making a tight thread on the locking collar. Otherwise the unit seems to work fine.
1,Same as less expensive sockets,"This socket is identical to the lower cost sockets available on Amazon, except it has Marinco on the cap. We received both and they are the same. Not worth over 3X the cost for the name."
3,Uh........,"I'd call the title of this album a bit misleading. Of course I guess that all boils down to opinion. This does have decent bands on it, songs from Helmet, Smashing Pumpkins, Mother Love Bone, and Gruntruck. However some of this isn't really that good, or even grunge (Tin Machine?). Then there's the fact of missing numerous huge names in the genre, and it's only 10 tracks. Basically it's something that's destin for the bargain bin, which is probably where you'll find it. Still, some good songs. Your best bet for one disc of grunge is still probably the soundtrack to the movie ""Singles""."
3,"Too much melodrama, too much Scots dialect","This much admired Innes novel is actually one of my least favorite. The story of a mysterious death, in a snow storm, in Scotland, of the Laird of Erchany, is told by several different characters, which I found annoying.The plot is like something out of a nineteenth century gothic ghost story. The only part I really liked, was a section dealing with adventure in Australia, which comes vividly to life. I own almost all of Innes, and have reread some of them more than ten times. This one only twice."
5,A Most Remarkable Tale that left me Breathless!,"I have never read Michael Innes before, so I was not prepared for this book at all. It is wonderfully complex, and the characterizations are truly masterful. The setting of the book is also noteworthy since it takes place at a remote Scottish castle right at Christmastime. The book does not spare the reader. It will take you on an emotional roller-coaster ride that never ends until the very last page. Innes' portrayal of a a mad Scottish lord is chilling. And Innes' detective John Appleby has to be one of the the most unique in the whole industry. I cannot say enough good things about this book, and about Michael Innes. Whatever you do try to find it and read it, read it, read it. I got my copy from the library. Luckily one library in our wonderful system saw the merits of keeping this very old book."
5,Loved it.,"As someone who was born and raised in Hawaii, I recognized places in the book and some of the things people did.At the bottom of it all is the story. I have read all in the Arcane series and this one is just as good (great) as all the others.Well worth the hard cover price. I can't wait for the next one."
4,Enjoyable Read,I really enjoyed the characters in this book and the storyline was great. I would recommend this to anyone who has enjoyed the Archane books in the past this one doesn't let you down.
4,good,"I thought the hero and heroine were interesting together but I didn't feel as though the mystery was as developed as previous books of the Arcane society. Also, Krentz had a lot of potential with the antagonist that she did not use.In this book, the two characters could see auras. In an extraordinary way they could even manipulate people--very scary stuff. The book begins great when the heroine knows she is about to be murdered by a trusted friend. Then Krentz hits us with a little of a cliff-hanger when she doesn't tell us how the heroine survives the threat, but leads us to the hero's side of the story. From there on the story lags a little. Not that it wasn't interesting reading about the two falling in love, but previous books had so much mystery and action in it, where this one lacked that.Overall, I found it enjoyable, but feel it could have been more."
3,Didn't seem like JAK,"In my humble opinion JAK is one of the best suspense/romance writers. I have really liked the other Arcane books. ""Running Hot"" lacked her usual snappy dialogue, humor and pace. To me this book didn't even seem like JAK was the author. I wish there was a lot more character development. Usually I read her books more than once. I won't reread this one. It was really flat."
3,A solid performance,"For those that are familiar with the Arcane Society novels, this is a solid performance by Krentz. Not her best work, but not a hard read either - it's good fill-the-time reading. I enjoyed it thoroughly, and look forward to another installment."
2,"What was once a unique, creative idea now overdone","This is not her best work for sure, but I find a lot of JAK's work to be all over the place w/ respect to quality. When she first started w/ the Arcane series, I found them intriguing and unique. There was just enough sprinkling of the paranormal to make it almost possible and the characters had, well, character. Now everybody and his/her uncle has a talent, and the talents are getting more and more unbelievable, and the characters are very 2D with just a few moments of humor and realism. I also couldn't buy into the attraction b/w the main characters, who, in typical JAK style, jump into the sack w/in the first few chapters. If you're a die hard fan, save your money and take it out of the library if you must rather than buying it. If you want a good read, save your time too and skip this one."
3,It's an ok read,The story is fine. It's a quick read and there were some new characters introduced (Sweetwaters). There is also a hint that Fallon is finally going to get a story of his own. I've been waiting for that one for a long time. (Maybe a Sweetwater daughter who wants to get away from the family business??)I would have loved a bit more action. Heck just a fight in the bar and grill would have livened it up a bit.
4,I can understand Luther has concerns about Grace,I was a little iffy about this book when it started out - what are the chances that a librarian would stumble upon a high level 'evildoer' meeting and that the love interest would be the only person she could touch. Yeah.But then the story got rolling and I rather liked it. Like Grace I found myself being concerned about the sperm donor - wouldn't that be a horror. The opera was an interesting twist.I'm not aware of Krentz's personal life but she does an excellent job of creating families out of people that are not blood related.
3,Love the Setting,"Really enjoyed the setting of this book - Hawaii. I liked the complexity of the characters, and even think that I liked the secondary characters just as much. The eccentric couple who run the bar were very fun. I didn't feel quite as much chemistry between the main characters as I would have liked, but the paranormal aspect of their natures does sort of skip over the slow build up that is typical in romance novels."
2,Lost in the Arcane Society,This book is a huge disappointment for this long time Krentz fan. It meanders around trying to create credibility for the psuedo science it's full of and does little or nothing to give you insight or frankly interest in the characters. I had to force myself to finish.
3,OK,Story and plot were good but too much was revealed too soon. It was easy to tell what was going to happen. Not really any surprise bad guys or plot twists.
2,Corsica,"I was disappointed because I felt it wasn't representative of the type of music I thought I was getting. Should have bought Barbara Fortuna. The music was very nice, jst not my taste."
1,"Great while it worked, but .....","We got the gadget, and after I put it together, it worked GREAT - my wife and I loved it.Last night, after we had the corkscrew for abut 4 months, wifey went to open a bottle of wine and the main lever BROKE - making the thing TRASH.I'll but a higher quality corkscrew next time"
1,You get what you pay for.,I purchased this wine opener for a friend of mine. I've used these lever type wine openers for years and love them. This particular model is a poor quality product. Yes it's cheap and that's what you should expect when you buy it. the mechanism is not smooth and frankly it's more work than other similarly designed but better quality openers. If you can't afford to spend more money then buy this but note you will get exactly what you pay for.
4,Good quality item for the price,Like every wine bottle I open with this opener.Nice solid item and definitely worth 12$ I paid atAmazon sale.
2,Glad I didn't pay list price...,"I just got this from Amazon at $14.99. I thought it sounded like a great deal, considering the list price of $49.99. It seemed a little flimsy (handles were a little thin on the plastic)and opening bottle was awkward on first attempt, but on the second attempt it worked like a charm. However, the third bottle of wine I opened, a handle fell off and pieces went flying. I was able to piece it back together, but not sure for how long that will last. I'm just glad I got it for myself instead of as a gift...Not exactly a sturdy gadget."
1,fatal problems,"I bought this particular lever corkscrew because I read a very favorable review in Consumer Reports. It is all metal which is necessary because the lever action actually puts a lot of stress on the gears, the guide and the frame. After about 50 bottles the pin in the guide started wearing and the screw no longer entered the cork along the axis of the device making it harder and harder to use. I actually fixed this a couple of times but then the frame actually broke at its thinnest point.End of story."
2,"Loved it, but it broke","I received this as a Christmas gift, and it really does make opening a bottle of wine fun and easy. But the pin that holds the mechanism started wearing, and it finally broke after about 3 or 4 months. So we're back to our handy, trustworthy waiter type bottle opener. If you want something fun to use at a party, go for it. But have another bottle opener in your pocket, just in case."
2,"Good design, doesn't last","We had this opener for over a year, and loved it. Its easy to use, and does a great job. Unfortunately, the handle broke off where it meets the lever this week, and based on the comments, my experience isn't unusual. I wouldn't buy another one - its too much for a disposable item."
1,"Fatal Problems, Indeed!","After using an opener of the same design, and buying a similar one for a gift, I decided to try the Insta-Pull brand. I wish I hadn't. The 90 day warranty is not long enough. I used it with some regularity for almost 120 days. The main lever broke off the gear while pulling out a cork. Also, the included foil cutter doesn't cut foil. The one I bought as a gift is from Bed, Bath & Beyond, costs $9.99, comes with extras (including a handy stand), and has lasted a couple of years so far. So I bought myself one of those. There's more metal and the foil cutter actually works."
2,Got ours on a special offer and...,"it worked magnificently for about 30 bottles until...kapow!...it failed spectacularly and broke into several pieces. I think that plastic ""corks"" cause all types of corkscrews problems, and this one was also exposed by the dreaded plastic. Oh well, such is life. I was so impressed by the design that I will buy another of this type - I just don't know which one."
3,It works ok!,"After reading some of the reviews stating that the product broke apart in the reviewer's hands, I used the opener carefully. I bought this product as a 2nd opener for use in my office. I have opened dozens of wine bottles with the original of this type opener and know how it should work. I just haven't put a lot of pressure on when using this opener and it has worked like it should. The opener doesn't work quite as smoothly as the original - but doesn't cost anywhere near as much either. Just be gentle and careful."
3,Not as Good as a Rabbit,"We still use this opener occasionally, but often times we simply use an old fashioned cork screw. It looks fancy and when used right it does save some time and effort. It is difficult to get it to work right each and every time."
2,Great for a year & broke,"Fantastic concept. Easy to use once you learn it, and works great. Makes opening a wine bottle effortless. Unfortunately, after about a year the handle broke off of the gear. have to throw it away. That weld should have been stronger. Obvious weak spot. They should have known better."
2,Worked Great but.....,This wine opener was a pleasure to use for 4 months then the main lever broke. It was still probably worth the money.
1,Wine Opener,"The Insta-Pull should really have been named Insta-Bust. After a dozen bottles, more or less, one of the pair of bottle clamping handles snapped loose. (Examination of the part and its retaining rod showed the separation to be an impossible action. There just isn't any way the rod could have bent and then straightened itself back and nothing was actually broken.)Anyhow, the whole thing is much too light and too flimsy to do the work. Pulling a cork takes considerable pressure and the plastic Insta-Device ain't got it and can't resist it."
2,Not what it was cracked up to be,"Package was a Christmas gift, was incomplete with a sealed empty box. My sister who gardens was very disappointed."
3,FIRST REVIEW,"Something I did like about the book was that it offered maps.Unfortunatley, while Kindle did recognize the underlined links, it was incapable of launching any of them.Kindle Customer service was quick to put this down to misgivings of the book/publisher and not the Kindle.Apparently they were able to duplicate the problem but unable to do anything about it and therefore they did offer my money back.As they recognized, this was something of a moot offerring as this was a free book, but it did give me pause about Kindle's ability to launch links in any book...This book is primarily for someone who knows little or nothing about Alexander the Great.It would appear to be little more than an expanded outline.If all you are interested in is a very topical and simple look at Alexander the Great's life this short book would be a good choice for you.I suspect that very topical and simple looks are the way of any title in the ""Makers of History"" series."
3,"Interesting and easy reader, but maps are missing in Kindle version","Interesting book about Alexander's life. The book is an 'easy reader' and doesn't go too much into details, but a good overview of history. Although I enjoyed the book, the reason for giving it 3 stars is that the illustrations and maps are missing in the Kindle version. Maps are a must if you like to 'picture' the route Alexander took during his conquests."
2,Average,Short on detail and only OK for someone who only requires general outline of the history surrounding Alexander The Great
3,An interesting romantic tale.,Among the things pointed out by the author is the fragility of truth in tales from centuries B.C. At various points these are obvious. They quickly become a fixture in the mind as an ever-present plausibility. It is fascinating to read of the conquests of Alexander and to realize that he was a borderline barbarian - so close to rising a notch higher. An interesting and entertaining read. The lack of maps is easily overcome.
4,Its free and interesting,"So before I read this book I knew of Alexander the Great (most people do) and I knew just a tiny bit about his life and actual conquest. For a free book on my Kindle it was perfect! I had a desire to understand a historical person that is well known and this book goes through his life and conquests in an interesting and easy to understand way.The maps not opening was very annoying. Some of the reviews complain about this being a huge problem but I don't think you can complain about a free book. It definitely would have been nice to see on a map the places that Alexander and his army went. It would have probably been even more useful as far as having a good understanding of the history, but you can go online and see some maps if you really want to. The book definitely deserves a fair 4 out of 5. If your looking for a nice overview of Alexander the Great that is not boring reading and very informative then I think you've found it."
2,Too much of the author's opinion,"It's a good book to get an overview of Alexander the great, but for me it seemed that the author shared too much of his personal opinion, which makes me want to read a more balanced book to confirm the events described in this book"
5,A very serious book,"This is indeed a serious book, because it is not a fabricated story, but a history with so many references."
2,Decent for smaller women,"I ordered this binder with the expectation that it would be ""full of"" women. Unfortunately, however, the binder came with no women inside. I found some women in the kitchen and asked them if they could come out, but, honestly, they did not fit. Avery needs to construct their binders better in order to more effectively fill them with women."
3,errrr........ E-Z turn????,"I use this binder for school and i have 3 folders, and some papers. It takes me 3 minutes to turn the pages without them ripping!! I have NO idea why they say EZ turn because as i said before......... IT TAKES ME 3 MINUTES TO FLIP LIKE 10 PAGES!!!!! Other than that i have troubles trying to open the ring. Everything else is good though....... if there is anything left!"
1,"Price went up, quality went down",I used to exclusively use Avery 3-ring binders in my training packet making. I decided to get these for my child due to past quality. After less than 2 months they are in pieces. They go from the desk to the locker and back. Never carried from the building and not abused. EVERY KID in her class has had them fall apart. Many opted for the easy open $12 version and the covers fell of before hers. Some kids are hard on things ~ mine is the exception to the rule but EVERY KID in the class has had the same issue (some sooner than others obviously from the care they take). I made a comment to the teacher about cheap China stuff but he told me to look at the label inside the back cover (product of US)...I am extremely disappointed that they have cut corners and lowered the quality of these binders and will look elsewhere next time I need binders. These didn't even stand up like I would expect the cheaper versions to. Shame on Avery for giving US workmanship a bad name!
2,Falls apart:(,I use mine for school and it's already falling apart! I think I need a new binder and it's just december! Crappy!
1,Bad Quality or Bad packing???,"bought 6, and 3 came broken all over the seems and 1 just a little...decided to exchange for new ones and the new ones came broken as well. I am not sure if it is the packing or the product."
1,Not Made For Use,"I purchased this product at a local chainstore before the beginning of school. I am a college student taking 4 classes 2 days a week so I needed something that would hold a fair amount of paper for note taking, as well as class work and handouts. After less then 4 months of usage this binder has completely fallen apart. It holds a lot but what difference does that make when the vinyl cover holding it all together has come apart. Hopefully spending the extra few dollars on the heavy duty binder by Avery will provide better results for this coming semester of college. If you are only using this to sit on a shelf in an office then this binder will serve you well otherwise look for something designed for real use."
1,Poor quality construction - bad value,"These binders arrived, and upon inspection I discovered that the vinyl seams were all coming apart right out of the box. Both binders are falling apart and I haven't even put them into service yet."
1,Which binder am I in?,"Where, oh, where can my binder be? I bought this high class 3"" binder that holds a huge portfolio to see if I was in it, but I wasn't there. Am I in the middle class 2"" binder that only holds a medium-sized portfolio? Or am I in the bargain-priced, below poverty level 1"" binder that you can't cram both a woman and a portfolio into no matter how hard or how long you work at it?? I think I'm entitled to more than the Economy View binder. If you find me in one of those binders, please. . . I'm begging you . . . please let me out! I yearn to get into a big, big, big binder that can hold a huge portfolio (and pay less tax on it)!"
3,Very cheap - but not good for the arthritic fingers,"I bought three of these binders as they seemed cheap compared to the others in the market. They arrived on time, and looked fairly sturdy.However when I try to snap open the EZ turn ring -- it was a pain (literally) for my arthritic fingers. Thus, I think I will use this binder for papers that I need to store away and do not need to refer to often.I still prefer the staples brand binder."
5,Binder,The Avery Binder is one of the best that I have encountered. I like being able to lay the contents flat so that they don't get damaged. This one came in record time and I am very pleased.
4,Good value and quality for the money!,The enclosure works great and it's good looking! The only thing to consider is that it uses 2 (two) USB ports on your computer (one for the power source and the other for data). May I also add that the product is very easy to put together.
5,Works Great,"This 2.5"" enclosure really works well... The extra USB for extra power is not always needed. Some USB ports can push the drive with the data USB alone connected. Small, neat, compact, no wires. Just be careful when removing the Hard Drive; you could break off the LED to the front; but it's pretty strong (self tested)."
2,Needs double USB ports,"Product works, but it needs two USB ports in order to get enough power to run the drive. Form factor and appearance is great, but USB issue stinks.Disappointing..."
3,Just ok,"It's a normal case for 2.5"" hard drives. I didn't like that I have to plug two USB cables, 1 for data 1 for power."
5,The best!,"I used this music while nursing my babies when they were first born and also while they were sleeping. The lullabies are lovely with wonderful, relaxing arrangements. Definitely a must for all new parents!"
4,nancy drew,I listen to this before going to bed. It is not just for babies. Puts me to sleep ever time!!!
2,Too Sweet - Vendor too Slow!,"I have to have gluten free. This fits the bill. BUT, it's way too sweet. There are definitely better whey options out there, but for the money, this is OK. The vendor, Organics Wholesale (Amazon) advertised the product as in stock. It wasn't. I waited 3 weeks just to get it. When you deal with the vendor via email, you have no idea who you're communicating with. Fortunately, nothing shady, but don't order from Organics Wholesale unless you have PLENTY of time."
4,A valuable reference,"For the person with more than a few days to spend, this book will be an invaluable reference. For the rest of us, it's both an excellent reference and a ""wish list"" of places we'd like to see and photograph.Unlike a few other excellent books on photographing the West, this one does not include detailed hints on how to take each photograph. It is not a ""how to"" book. Instead, it's a very detailed account of hundreds of places where beautiful and/or interesting landscapes can be seen. It includes directions to the sites and extensive commentaries on access, the use of guides at some places, tips on things to avoid, best times to photograph, and more. There is an accompanying CD which contains color photographs of many of the features described.Highly recommended for the person who does not need a detailed account of each photograph, and who is interested in exploring both the highlights and the out-of-the-way sights."
3,"An okay book, but with a few caveats.","I have both volumes 1 and 2 of this series, and whilst they offer a reasonable guide to thw American South West, both books contain over 40 pages of ""photographic advice"" at the front which is repeated in both volumes I have. The information is somewhat simplistic and in my opinion, unnecessary. These are 40 odd pages that could have been better devoted to expanding on some areas of the book that are rather spartan on information and maps etc."
5,Not just for photographers; scenic drives and hikes,"This set of guides contains just the right amount of information to selectively choose your next Southwest driving or hiking destination:1. Full color pictures of destinations2. A rating system for the scenic value of the destination and hiking and driving difficulty getting there3. An appropriate level of description, including directions4. An overview map showing the destinationsI highly enjoyed my previous visit to Southern Utah, but found it hard to know where to go with the limited time I had. Now armed with this series of books, I am prepared to make the best of my next trip. Of course, you will need road maps and trail maps, but the author mentions several great resources for these as well, some of which I was not aware of. Thanks to the author for putting together these great resources!"
2,"ok, but overrated as far as photographic advice is concerned","The book is ok and gives some really useful advice as far as (unusal) walks and detours are concerned. As far as adivce for photographers is concerned, the book is, however, not really good. you can find much more information online, e.g. be reading traveler reports or checking on tripadvisor."
5,"Excellent book (All three volumns, in fact)!",I purchased all three volumes just before my partner and I went on an extended Southwest vacation. The directions and photography hints are all on the mark. Highly suggest you buy this if you are contemplating a vacation to any of the areas covered in this book!
2,Decent textbook hindered by political biases,"This textbook is a decent summary of the various family life cycle issues. However, the authors' obvious political biases and leanings interfere with a balanced perspective and with the content of the book. Several people in my master's level class found the book to be biased and unhelpful in certain areas."
2,The Expanded Family Life Cycle,"This book is not easy to read, it has no pictures and the text is too small. I know this is not a childrens book, but sometimes pictues break up the monotony of the boring textbook.JB"
1,Caustic Personal Agenda,"I actually looked forward to reading this text, but upon furthr examination, found it to be a very ""glass-half-empty"" approach to the family life cycle. It is blatantly obvious that the 2 authors have their own political agenda to cram down our throats. Their vitrolic accusations against males, whites, Christians, etc. insight me to become an advocate for those they discriminate against - to expose their hypocritic instructions to be respectful, empathetic and flexible toward others. And by the way, for ""experts"" to use the term ""homophobic"" is a clinical and education travesty. To discriminate against those who do not condone the lifestyle by calling them names is simply politically correct, immature, and evidence of their agenda."
1,extreme anti male bias,"this book was required for my grad school program. It was so biased it was worse than useless. myself and several classmates refused to read it after several chapters. This is an author with an axe to grind against all men. Every chapter has derogatory statements towards men. The double standard is aweful, if a man wrote like this in this age the book would be banned. It is just plain sexist. I would have hoped for better from Smith College. There are few useful citations. Crazy statement like ""all first born brothers suffer from entitlement"". Hello? Stand up to end the ware between genders. It is time to understand and value one another."
1,Is this a text or a manifesto?,"The writers of this book attempt to mask their political agenda as facts needed in order to work in family therapy. Instead of providing insight into the problems and challenges of family therapy the reader is delugued with opinions with are anti-male, anti-marriage, and racist."
1,"racist, biased, and lacking in helpful information","The lack of practical, usable information in this book was unbelievable. Maybe if you have never, ever, in any way considered these issues it would be helpful, but I doubt it, as there was nothing that delved beyond surface, common sense information. The gross overgenderalizations about race and culture were offesive and shocking coming from people in the field. The only thing I took from the book was a heightened awareness of the judgemental biases of people -- even those claiming to be fighting against those things."
1,The Old Testament is less DOGMATIC.,"This disappointing bookis pretentious andtransparently biased.I prefer a textbookI can learn from and trust,to one where I find myself toleratingstale slogans and stereotypes."
2,Dated Literature,"Although the book is well written, the information is well dated. The literature is based on facts of the 1990s. I was dissappointed my professor chose this book as I feel we could be learning better from a more recent text."
2,Not really worth buying...,"I had to buy this for a graduate school class. This book has very little relevant information and is quite biased in its outlook. That is besides being quite wordy, talks in a round-about manner and it takes a long time to get through a chapter. I gave it 2 stars since there was something (not too much) that I learned from the book that I didn't already know from logic, reasoning or another class. There must be a better textbook out there on the Family Life Cycle, because this isn't one of them!"
5,"Exciting, educational and highly entertaining!!!","I saw this film several times in 1960. I can't forget it, and really want a copy for my grandchildren. I'm sure they'll like its accurate protrayal of a Jaguar's life in the jungle just as much as I do."
5,quick service product exactly as described great value,The product was exactly as ordered - Second set of these phones for another house - First set we had for over a year and absolutely no problems - batteries hold up very well and phones work great - would buy again - order came promptly
1,These phones ended up being garbage! No customer service!,"Ordered these in November 2011. One of the phones worked correctly. One had minor display problems. One had a little worse display but still readable. One charger did not work. Sent an email to the seller but received no reply. At this point, none of the displays work and two of the phones have dialing problems. I would not order from this person again due to not receiving a response. (Also had to order new batteries in order to test them although the package appeared new and unopened.) Within a short time, none of the phones were working."
2,"Great phone, but very short life","The phones work great for a while. On two of my three phones the display has degraded to the point of being unreadable. The battery life on all three phones is now down to the point where it will start beeping the low battery warning within 15-20 minutes of use. I was happy with these phones until they started to have problems, which was probably about 1 year into having them. After 2 years they are close to unusable."
4,GE Cordless Phone,"We have been happy with the phones. Initially, we were having a little problem with noise but purchased an inexpensive filter at radio shack and it resolved the issue."
2,Not the phone in the picture!,"I ordered this phone. The phone pictured has an answering machine, this model does NOT! The description of the model is accurate though."
4,Best Tanner,"Of the 7 Tanner books I've read, I liked this one the best. They're all fun; this was just a bit more so."
4,"Un""bear""ably funny, first rate book","Great style, nice flow.produces lots of mental images,this book makes you stop and think, and then laugh out loud."
4,"Half a great book, but will provoke you to laugh out loud","The bear-to-man part of this book is the more developed, but both pathways (set in alternating chapters) include setups with punch lines that will make you ocassionally laugh out loud.Take in small bites, to savor. Not great writing, but fun."
3,Enough with the bear thing,"I saw the praiseworthy reviews and began reading with high hopes. But I'm afraid I'm with the reviewers who felt it got to be a bit too much of a fun thing. For the first 30-50 pages I was entertained. I found it to be genuinely funny in places. But then I found myself trying to chuckle, trying to be entertained, and, as many of you know, that becomes a challenge. I have no doubt that many found the farce funny to the end, and it doesn't necessarily surprise me. The book is cleverly written and the premise is extremely creative."
5,As if I didn't already have ENOUGH to do...,"I have read only the first twelve pages of The Bear Went Over the Mountain, and already I know that I will have to go and read every damn thing Mr. Kotzwinkle has ever written!"
4,We BEAR-ly take time to smell the roses.,"The cover of this book was the first thing to catch my eye. Upon reading the back cover it sounded like a funny story - IT IS! I enjoyed the light hearted, yet ""right on"" focus of the story. How many times have we seen how power and money can obscure the real world that these people live in? Althought predictable in parts, the story is light and moves well throughout. It's great to see how the people that surround Hal Jam (the bear)can't see past the ""want-to-be"" syndrome that their involved in. Also it's effect on the bear as he becomes more convinced of his own ""personhood"". I, as others that have read ""The Bear that went over the mountain"", have seen the direct releationship to the childhood story of ""The Emperor's New Clothes"". A funny, light read to be enjoyed and laughed at."
2,this is new?,"this idea, and the humorous situations that grow out of the premise, has been done so many times it's hard to believe that anybody would bother writing it. Surely there are moments to laugh at, but large portions of the book seem to have been lifted right out of ""Being There"", with a little less satirical bite (a lot less, really). How many times is it going to be funny that people mistake this bear for a hemmingwayesque man ?Obviously, somebody out there likes this thing, but I had a creeping sense of deja vu at the beginning, kept waiting for some new unexpected twist, and then finally gave in to overhwelming boredom as I finished it up. Never again!"
3,"A terrible gift, but a funny book","So.... my grandma gave me this book for Christmas. Both she and one of her friends had read it, so she suggested I read it. That was not the wisest of decisions. MANY parts of this book were enormously funny, but some parts were just too inappropriate for my age level. Don't get me wrong, I liked this book a lot, but I wouldn't have bought it if I had known what it talked about. I'm used to cuss words and I understand everything that happened, it's just many parts were too much. I believe this would be a good book for adults, not me. Thanks grandma, but maybe get me a book from my age level next time."
4,A good story,I found this to be an enjoyable read. Quite entertaining. One that you could put down and easily pick up later. Not deep -basically a good story to read before bed or when you have a small bit of down time.
1,one star is one too many,"I am both astounded and confounded by the reviews here. Simply put, this is the single worst novel I have ever read. Everything about it--the writing, the characters, the story--is godawful. Here follows an absolutely true story. While I was forcing myself to read this drivel, I went out on date. She and I were discussing how much of a book one should read before giving up on it. I was advocating the 25 page litmus, and she insisted on at least fifty. She did several long train commutes a week to and from work, and so read a lot of novels. Anyway, I started describing this book. She recognized it immediately, and interrupted me saying, ""The Bear Went Over The Mountain! Don't read another word! If you think it's bad now, it only gets worse, if you can believe it!"" She was right. If you feel the need to find out for yourself, save your money and borrow it from a friend or the library."
2,A Fable Too Far,"The Bear Went Over the Mountain was a clever idea, and seemed to portray a firm stance - natural and terse is betterthan man-manipulated and complex. But it went on too long. The arguments for the human side lost groundsteadily, until the energy to represent that side practically fizzled out entirely. If that was what the author was going for, hemade it. But it was too snide and arch for me, almost from the beginning. Neither side was believable, at any level.I love the natural world, but it didn't appear in this book - only a caricature of it. The humans chosen to be in the actwere also larger and more grotesque than life. Being a woman, I especially balked at the portrayal of women. They were allghastly, and continued to get worse as they ""developed"". Would not recommend."
2,GROSS AND DUMB,"I find it absolutely amazing that this book has 4 1/2 stars.Do readers have no taste at all. I cannot begin to relate justhow many ways this book is unfunny and gross. I could believeit would appeal to a bunch of 8th grade boys in a crowd who are trying to see who can be the grossest, but beyond that I am ata complete loss.If your tastes run to ""quirky"" (& I would disagree with thatdefinition but it seems to appeal to the reviewers), then maybeyou will find this book a good read. But I would suggest thatit is time to grow up or acquire some sophistication."
1,"Horrible, abhorrent, ludicrous!","I received this book as a gift, and was repulsed by it. I suppose some may find this a brilliant satire, but I can find many, many better uses for my time than to waste it on such a piece of drivel. I found the segment where the bear has intercourse with a woman to be particularly repulsive. This book was so repugnant to me that I didn't even bother reading the second half, nor did I save it to pass along to a friend. I just threw it in the trash. Save your money. If you must stoop to read it, get it from the library instead."
1,Poorly written and gutless,"I'm sorry to disagree with the other reviewers, but I found this book to be without merit. The story is abysmal and the writing is leaden. I would describe this book as perfect airport fodder, fit only for inclusion alongside Danielle Steel (or whatever her name is), Jackie Collins and other meaningless garbage of the ilk.I've read funnier instruction manuals for food processors."
4,Rich satire on publishing and the 'media' in general,"This satirical look at the world of publishing gives us an amusing story of a bear who steals an author's manuscript and passes it off as his own It's more plausible than it sounds! While the bear becomes more human (nobody notices he's a bear), the real author begins to behave in a bearlike fashion. The transformation of both characters is handled well. I found the book hilarious and highly recommend it."
4,Has helped me lose 8 pounds so far,"I began taking these pills in addition to lowering my calories per day by half, and have so far lost 8 pounds in 5 weeks! It definitely curbs the hunger pains, but as someone else said in an earlier review, it's counter-productive if you eat past the ""full"" feeling. I'm listening to my stomach more and am eating much less and losing weight."
2,Super Christian,"I think it would be helpful to have this book referenced as a Christian book. I missed that it was published by Faithwords. We found the constant references to God and the Bible a bit much. If I had thumbed through this in a book store I would not have purchased it. Although we did glean a few ideas, many are things we do or have thought of already. It just got old for us with all the ""God fuzzies."""
3,nice gift,this made for a nice gift for my friends but I read it before I gave it and less than half of the things were stuff I would really do with my kids. But it is worth that for the price and my friends said they liked it.
4,Good product for the price,"I bought this KVM switch since it satisfied my specifications and had reasonably low price among similar others. I use it from time to time to switch between Dell notebook / WinXP Pro and Compaq workstation / WinXP Home, so far have no problems. The only inconvenience is the use of ScrollLock as a switching hotkey, which is different from double Ctrl, found in similar IOGear products."
5,"Great, but beware USB/PS2 adapters","I bought this along with a non-IOGEAR adapter to convert 2xPS2 to USB, as my notebook has no PS2 connectors. The result was horrible. If you need an adapter, buy the IOGEAR GUC10KM adapter. The setup works like a dream. It isn't worth the hassle of buying a cheaper USB/PS2 converter that could be incompatible. I have it switching KVM between my home desktop and my notebook, which is then running in two-screen mode with external keyboard and mouse. Magic!"
2,not good enough,"installation was easy, but the video quality has gotten a lot worse than before the install. my collegue bought a belkin 4-ports kvm, and it works beautifully without any video quality degration. well, i guess you get what you paid for.... i do not recommend this product unless you are real tight on budget."
1,Piece of junk,"I have been using KVM switches for several years. First my goal was to have access to both Linux and Windows for research and general purposes respectively. Those who have tried dual-boot Linux and Windows in early 2000s know how unstable that combination is -- shelf life of 6 months at most. Frustrations on that front led me to get my first KVM switch. Since I used to work from home (still do) and have personal interests, KVM switch came in handy again.A month ago my previous switch died. I don't recall what brand it was, but it worked for 2 years. After reading the reviews, I bought this piece. It worked on one computer but not on the other: a single tap begat scores of letters on my desk and I could not use the backspace key. I use the Microsoft Natural Elite keyboard for the past 4 years and do not understand why this piece of junk won't work with that.I bought the KVM switch (USB only) from TrendNET and that seems to be working fine. Skip this one and try TrendNET instead."
3,May not be compatible with all video cards,"It advertises has superior quality up to 1940 X 1440. Not sure if it is my video card, monitor, or KVM but I was seeing fuzzy lines on both sides of the screen and occasional shakes in the screen until I lowered my resolution to 1024 X 768 and even had to lower my screen refresh rate from 85 to 70 hertz to make it go away."
1,Misleading - does not work with mac keyboard,"Despite being advertised on their web site as being compatible with a Mac Mini, this requires use of a scroll lock key to switch computersHence it will not work with a Mac keyboard.It also does not recognize mice attached through the keyboard only directly to the KVM.Overall Not useful for Mac / PC combinations."
5,Don't pay more for a KVM!,Got it. Installed it. 1 minute later - it works! This is a great KVM for a great price. Strongly recommended
1,Awesome for PS/2 - USB buyer beware,"I got this device and immediately loved it. HOWEVER, I have a USB mouse and I used a USB to PS/2 converter to make it work with this KVM. Over time my USB mouse has stopped working properly and I have to unplug the mouse for several seconds and plug it back in. Otherwise, it does odd things like completely locking up, causing my browser to go backwards and forwards and sometimes closing windows. So, I dug into the documentation and found where it does indeed say that you can't use USB devices with it, which make this purchase was a COMPLETE waste of my money. I suppose it was my fault, but they could have made the USB - PS/2 conversion incompatibility more eye catching. It is very interesting that their USB version of this device is almost twice as expensive.Update: After going through two USB mice, I tried another USB mouse (same type of mouse) and the mouse has been working fine for probably 6 months. So, I'm not sure if it was the mouse or the IOGear device."
5,Excellent KVM switch!,For a cheap KVM switch you can't beat it. KVM switches are expensive at some stores. Office Depot had one for $90. This one was only $12. Excellent value and works great.
3,"Blurry image at higher resolutions, 20"" Dell monitor could not sync","The product descriptions claims that it works for resolutions up to 1920, my experience was different.When i plugged it into my Dell 2005WFP (20"" wide) monitor and changed the resolution to 1680x1050, the image initially appeared very blurry. Invoking ""Autosync"" from the monitor setup menu, caused the image to sift over to one side of the screen leaving approx. 1/3 of the screen black (1/3 of the desktop was invisible)This happened both when using a T60 laptop with an ATI X1300 graphics chip and a desktop with GeForce 6200 (by ASUS)Both sources work perfectly OK when connected to the monitor directly using a VGA cable (D-SUB)It did, however, work withAdesso PS/2 to USB Adapter, connects 2 PS/2 connectors to 1 USB port/hub (ADP-PU21 ), which I thought was nice. (T60 does not have a PS2 port, but i still was able to use the KVM switch with it)"
1,Video problems,"I have a Windows XP and Linux box connected by this KVM. The linux display is now slightly fuzzy and flickers, making it very annoying to use the system.On the other hand, setup is easy and the Windows box works quite well with the switch.I will be returning this product."
3,Doesn't work well with laptops...,"This product does not work well with laptops (usually only 1 PS/2 port) and wireless keyboard/mouse combos. I could not get IOGEAR's switch to work with a Dell laptop, a Dell desktop, and a new Logitech Elite Duo keyboard/mouse. The main problem is the lack of PS/2 ports on the laptop combined with the hotkey switching. Since all i want is a monitor switch, I'm going with a simple manual monitor switchbox."
1,doesn't work with IBM Thinkpad,"One of my machines is a thinkpad -- am using a y cable to hook it up to the KVM and the mouse doesn't work. It states in the manual that thinkpads may have problems if you hook up both the keyboard and the mouse, but what is the point of just hooking up one or the other? And it would be nice if they told you that before you buy it..."
2,Doesn't work...,"I have a Logitech keyboard without a Scroll key which is required for switching between CPUs. I've tried the automatic scanning mode, but it doesn't work either. You would think that there would be some means of changing the hot key on the unit, but there is none."
4,Not exactly what I was looking for but okay,"I have a wireless keyboard and mouse that I can switch easily between computers so I was only looking for a way to switch the monitor between my laptop and desktop computers. I was therefore disappointed when I couldn't find the manual switch (it has none). Switching is only through hotkeys on the keyboard so it is therefore necessary to have a PS2 keyboard plugged in (and it will not work at all without a keyboard plugged in).Fortunately I had an old PS2 keyboard out in the garage so I plugged it in and put it in the pullout keyboard drawer under my desk. I wasn't using that drawer any way so no loss of space. Now all I have to do is pull out the drawer and hit the hotkeys to make the switch. Problem solved.Otherwise, everything worked find. Cords are plenty long enough and the small footprint is very nice.Was concerned how dual monitor mode from my laptop would work but it worked fine and the quality is just the same as not using the switch."
4,Great addition to multitaskers,"Great product, simple easy instructions. Makes mutitasking on two computers much easier with less desk top space. I recomend this product to all do it yourselfers."
