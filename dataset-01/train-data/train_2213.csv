2,Poor quality washed out prints.,The title says it all. I've seen copies that have such better color. You get what you pay for here. For another seven bucks you can get one you will be happy with.
2,Cut Awkwardly,"The original piece is obviously bigger. I knew that the poster wouldn't include the whole piece, but it's just cut awkwardly. A piece of the man's head is missing. The manufactuaer should either re-scale the piece or shift the piece within the poster. I would go with another version of this.The seller gets 2.5 starts. Great packaging, but I don't like that if you buy multiple posters from Poster Revolution, they make you pay shipping for each poster even though it all comes in the same package with no extra shipping cost on their part."
2,Very low quality poster,"Colors are very pale and mostly in the yellow/brown color palette - nothing even slightly close to the vivid colors of the original. I realize that these posters are not discounted, they are simply very low quality. Additionally, I didn't notice until I got the poster that the top of the man's head is cut off on the poster."
4,"Dark, mad and gripping","I really enjoyed trying to work this book out.Martin is blind to the world and going morethan a little mad, when reading it the authorsends you through the same process. Its hard tofigure and just when you think you do, yourealise your ignoring your doubts.The middle section is wonderful, your compelled to read it in one sitting.I love the way the author describes the surroundings while leaving the country, region and year completely ambiguous.This is a very clever book, maybe too cleverfor me, but then thats part of it all, you never know."
2,If only it were as good as the text on the book jacket...,"Mediocre, I thought. Slow-moving and rather predictable at the end. It seemed like two books, the first very interesting dealing with Martin's reaction to his condition, the second a drawn out 100 page explanation of what happened to the girl he was seeing. There was very little connection between the two halves of the book other than Nina herself and the man following her. Overall, I thought the concept was interesting but not well played out."
4,A thriller beyond what Hollywood could ever do,"This is not a book for people who are afraid of the dark! Rupert Thomson is a master of telling the tales of the impossible in a way, that everything else seems impossible, and the story told seems the only interpretation of the world. His big problem is his languege, which sometimes becomes to poetic and thereby leaves the caracthers to their own faith. I don't think this is the case in this book, as much as in others (Air&Fire), but still it is a problem. The main problem in this book is the total change of scene (From the middle and on), which is hard to accept at first, especially because the tone and tempo changes at the same time. I also do not think the plot in the second half of the book is equally interesting to the first, which at that time will be the readers main interest. Still it would have been a worse life, if we didn't have the first sex-scene from part 2, which lets the darkness into the heart, in the shape of innocens"
4,A disturbing tale of a blind man who thinks he can see.,"This book disturbs me.I'm reading it right now, and I don't think I've read a darker novel in the last year. It's the story of Martin, a man who is shot in the head and blinded. He ends up with the symptoms of something called Anton's Syndrome--he thinks he can still see, but only at night. He leaves the clinic for the blind and strikes out on his own, gradually becoming a paranoid with a few good friends and a million conspiracy theories.I'm enjoying this book. It's worth a read."
2,Pointless,"Well what can I say what started out as an interesting premise, was very disappointing. Character development was non existenet, the storyline gave you glimpses of interesting future developments but those developments did not occur. Not a good book at all. I would not recommend it to anybody."
2,Two Books In One,"I purchased this book because the plot sounded unique and interesting. It was about a man who was shot and as a result was blind. He had a rare condition which would let him see at night. It went through his rehab and entering back into what now would be his regular life. He meets a girl in a bar and after breaking up with him, she disappears. After that, the focus of the book changes to the life of this girl. It explores her life as well as the lifes of her parents and grandparents. It is very dark and definitely not what I expected to be reading about. Not a dull book but one that I wouldn't read again."
2,Not that great,I am a fan of MMA and this video isn't that great. Some clips are jsut too short and the knock outs not that exciting. I kind of prefer to watch an entire fight. If you want to see 20 second one punch knockouts this is the video for you.
1,Underpainter also UnderAuthored,"This story is completely obscure -- is the point here that you can cover up what might be a vivid story with trails of thought so hazy that only a persistent reader can remember from page to page what's going on? If so, here's a great example of Underauthoring."
2,unusually affecting,"Although the narrator is not the most likeable person, this book is so beautifully and honestly written that i found myself deeply involved in his life. This book is engaging and unusually true to human nature."
1,I wish I had not read this book,"While I appreciated the clever use of imagery and symbolism in the book, and the author's grasp of a multitude of subjects, the emotional and moral infancy of the main character irritated me so much I wish I had not read this book. I would the narrator had ended his own miserable existence early on in the novel rather than devastate the lives of every decent person he encountered."
3,not sure about the extended metaphor,"I love all things Urquhart. she delivers a story filled with flawed and recovering characters. i had a hard time with the term 'underpainting' as i didn't understand it, and as it was an extended metaphor, I feel like I missed something.But the story line was solid. I had a great sense of place and of character at all times."
5,Mindfulness,"My psychologist recommended I read the mindfulness books by the author Kabat-Zinn. I have found them to be extremely helpful, interesting and they've actually given me a completely new way to look at my life. They're wonderful!"
2,not as good as expected,"it deffinatley helped me out however I found that alot of the information and phrases are used over and over again through out the boook which made it boring to read . I baught this book because its foreworded by Jon Kinn but it did not have his style. I also did not like the cheap white paper its printed on , it feels like a cheap copy that somone made at home with a photocopy mahcine."
3,Superb writing & well researched,"I as attrected to this book because a friend gave a review at a book group session. The author picked a subject that peaked my cursiosity. Ms Brooks is a correspondent for The Wall Street Journal, so I felt this book would be interesting reading. I was disappointed and sometimes repulsed by the narrative.The ending was weak.However think the author is a good reporter and I intened to read her book ""Nine Parts o Desire"""
2,Smokey BITES,"When Smokey & THe Bandit became I hit I guess everyone wanted to make a movie just like it...... this was an attempt at it, and I repeat ATTEMPT at it.This plots stupid and makes no sense. A kid named Roscoe who's a hot shot behind the wheel for no reason steals a car with the prom queen in it who's father is the towns sherrif and then abducts her as they speed away being chased by cops and these morons. However, she doesnt resist too much and ends up in love with him and they think there Bonny & Clyde or something.Then stupid things happen along the way like a Shiek wanting to buy moonshine that I guess they thought was a great idea. The ending is a bit zaney but not too bad... but overall, this movie is a typical ""seen it, dont wanna see it again"" kinda cheese flick.Watch it if your bored stupid and dont have any paint to watch drying."
5,The complete second story arc in a beautiful new box,Kenshin has set off on the long road to the old Kyoto capital where the threat of war looms. The forgotten manslayer named Makoto Shisho has returned with ten of the deadlest warriors to disrupt the peace of the Meiji government and reconstruct Japan in his own twisted vision.
3,It was okay...,"I recieved the delivery on time, even through the whole hurrican Sandy situation. But, one of the DVD's was skipping. It was the 3rd DVD to the last of this season, which was one of the best battles and story line in this season. Other than that, everything was a great."
5,Good stuff,"Complete season two. High quality with a good translation, English dubbed or Japanese with subtitles. Its a bit annoying how Kenshin speaks half the time (in the subtitles) , ""I will go with you, that I will"" is an example. But since it it not the case when he gets serious or with any of the other characters at any time, I'm sure its done with good reason. It stopped bothering me after the first few episodes. There are tons of extras including linear notes which explains the context and history of what happens in the series. For example if there is a reference to the Boshin Wars then the linear notes will provide a short history of it to help you understand Kenshin's context. Extra's also include fanart etc. A really good buy if you are a fan."
4,"Chicago house w/ funk, horns and latin","If you yearn for the good ol' days of disco funk with a strong horn section (Quazar, Zoom, Fat Larry's Band, Crown Heights Affair, Bohannon, etc. etc.), this will take you back. But it's totally contemporary in voices, arrangements, etc. Tracks 7 and 11 are worth the price of the CD, and there's lots of other good stuff, too."
3,good,"At the time the 3 year old was all about blues clues, now its charlie brown . this was stilla fun set to put into the rotation"
5,Audio Bob,"I'd like to start off stating that even if this recording is not remastered again , it is still superior to a regular cd because of the high resolution of the sacd format .all the CREEDENCE SACD'S ARE GREAT , don't let one person's opinion stop you from the sacd or dvd audio experience .also buyers beware of new mastered cd's of the last couple of years , distortion and compression are horrible."
1,Perhaps the same as Re-Mastered CD also on Amazon.,"No song samples included here but song list is the same as another CD titled ""Concert (20 Bit Mastering) [LIVE] [ORIGINAL RECORDING REISSUED] [ORIGINAL RECORDING REMASTERED],"" so check that out instead. Also, the other CD is remastered and this CD listing makes no claim to that.Goodluck from one CCR fan to another!Scottie"
1,Orion Blue Book: Copier 2000 (Orion Blue Book. Copier),I would like to read it befor i review it. Please e-mail some info about the book so that i can review it.Stephen SchneckThanks
2,Not what we needed,"The product was well made, did what it said it would do, and for the right person would be fine. But it did not fit our needs therefore the low rating. What we wanted was somthing to help my husband exit a tub-shower. His left arm was paralyzed and he needed something to balance against. This safety bar was too low and in face impeded his getting out of the tub. it was our fault for not realizing the problem having something low on the edge of the tub would cause. We ended up getting a bar that fastened to the wall and that works fine. For the right need, this would be a good item, but be sure you think about what it is you need before you order it."
4,Its a screen,"Pros:- Easy to mount- Good color reproduction- Low Cost- Multiple stops allow you to adjust it to fit your projection image (16:9, 4:3, etc)Cons:- There is a slight wave in the screen that is noticeable on images that pan across the screen. This seems to go away after it has been pulled down for a while.- Terrible packaging, and there was a dent in the housing when I got it. Since it was still functional and did not damage the screen I kept it anyway. But better packaging and a little more care by UPS could have prevented the damage.Other Thoughts:The retract function is a bit tricky and takes some getting used to."
4,A treat for the eye and for those interested in Samurai!,"This book is visually stunning. It is crammed with full-color artwork that is suitable for framing. The depictions of Samurai in their various armour throughout various periods of Japanese history are outstanding. If you did not know what a Samurai looked like before reading this book you certainly will afterward. The detail is magnificent.This book provides a detailed and history of Samurai from the early Heian Period all the way through the end the Samurai class. The writing is clear and easy to follow and there are many, many useful diagrams and interesting black and white photos and graphics as well.I highly recommend this book to anyone beginning to learn about feudal Japan and the Samurai elite. An excellent addition to your library.Kevin BrettCEO, Kevin Brett Studios, Inc.Author: The Way of the Martial Artist: Achieving Success in Martial Arts and in Life!The Way of the Martial Artist: Achieving Success in Martial Arts and in Life!"
4,Great information and well organized,"I purchased this book and was very pleased with the level of detail Mark took in his research. The book is well-organized and has the type of information most writers are looking for. I recommend this book for any person embarking upon the venture of self-publishing to avoid the pitfalls. I started out about to use a company just because it was the cheapest around...I would have had to typeset my own book with their provided templates. but there was so much more I hadn't thought about when it came to publishing. I enjoyed the fact mark educates you about things to think about when choosing a publisher. It's great for first-timers.I also like how he shared summaries from each company's contract. He shares costs, prices and benefits. He ranks each company and groups them together from recommended to ""ones to avoid"". You are provided with websites to each company for you to review. Mark leaves nothing out."
2,Rivers of Stone Review: What's all the Fuss About?,"River's of Stone is a very serene, and boring album. The music was well written, but the lyrics almost put me to sleep. This album could have been better with another vocalist and a little better production. Vocalist Madalena voice is hauntingly bad.Other's have compared Jade Redd to Evanessence,but I think that is comparison that is truely undeserved. The album is really an all aroung letdown."
5,The perfect camera for all users,"Wow! This camera does everything I expect from it and more. I've had it about a month, now, and I'm very impressed with the results. The aperture and shutter priority shooting modes enable capture of any scene. Sharpness and color rendition is outstanding. Flash results are excellent. Movies are superb. I used it for movies at the Seattle aquarium in a darkened exhibit last week and the results were perfect."
4,"Great Zoom, Small Camera","Olympus is known for great lenses and the C765 is no exception. Outdoor shots are terrific, indoors the camera tends to hunt to focus (Olympus did not equip the camera with focus assist beam for indoor shots, hence the 4 stars). Menus are intuitive and customizable so you have your most used functions 1 button away. Overall, a great cam for the money. After cam purchase, be sure to go to olycap.com and buy the nifty little aftermarket product that protects the C765's lens. It looks cool too."
3,great camera but...,"just like the rave reviews given, this is a very good camera to have. the best feature for me is the 10x zoom which just blows away the 3x zoom which other similar priced cameras have.now for the sad part. if you happen to upgrade to a 512 mb xD card, your battery just won't be able to keep up. according to olympus the battery can only average 175 shots per charge for typical use. if you're a typical user then you have no problem. a 512 mb card can manage around 500 shots. the battery will be dead before you can fill up the memory card. you'd better buy an extra battery or two especially if you're going on long trips where there are no electrical outlets available.* if the C765 uses typical AA batteries all you have to do is stock up on those but unfortunately it uses special ones which are expensive."
5,Great Camera,I replace my old Olympus 450 with this camera. I loved the old camera but it did not have all the features that I wanted. The new camera is great. It takes great pictures out of the box. If you spend the time to get to know all the features it takes even better pictures. I love being able to customize the settings. The zoom is the best feature of the camera. Allows you to get very close to your subject. Battery life is great but I would buy an extra battery because it does not give much warning when it is going.
3,Not her best work,"I *love*"" Lisa Brown's other works so I bought this book sight unseen. It's not her best work. My recommendations (ranking #s) are: ""Baby make me breakfast"" (#1), ""Baby fix my car"" (#2) and ""Baby do my banking"" (#3). ""Baby mix me a drink"" is a distant fourth. Then again, it's still fun!"
3,Would have appreciated a preview,"This book is based on an incredibly cute concept - put those lazy, good for nothing babies to work already! I bought it based solely on that. I was intrigued. The book is pretty darn cute, I must admit, but I was hoping for something more. Like how about mention of the auntie, who will undoubtedly be the one cool enough to be giving this book? If you're looking for a new mommy gift that's unique, buy this book - just make sure the new mommy has a good sense of humor first!"
1,Don't buy it,"It was really cheap when I bought it but now I know why, I will never use this book, worst drink book ever."
2,Boring.,"I thought it would have a cute story or rhyme inside, but it does not. I do not really recommend it only because there is not story to read to the little ones."
2,"a big disappointment, a baby could have done better","What a disappointment. A great idea seems to have been ruined by the attempt to be too hip for words. I was hoping for the creativity and wit of LET'S NOSH or the SUSHI board book. At least those rhyme (""Miso in my Sippy cup""). Instead we are left with an unrhyming, mean spirited, too hip for words board book. I expected more from this publisher. Still... it is a great concept, and a good gag gift, but worthless as a bedtime book."
1,Don't waste your money,This five page book isn't worth the cardboard it's printed on. It's neither amusing for an adult nor a child. We put it in the recycle bin shortly after receiving it. Save your money and buy yourself a real martini!
1,This book is a rip off,"Don't waste your money on this book. It is only 12 pages long and has about 15 words in total. At $9.00 it is just not worth it. I understand this is a baby book, but a waste of money for what you get. This book should be around $2.00 for as small and as short as it is. The description makes it sound as if it's interactive or has ideas for activities which it doesn't. Tweleve pages with pictures of cocktails and short descriptions is silly for what they are charging."
5,the best way to discover nina simone,"i've heard just some small pieces of the cd yesterday night in a friend's house, it'really impressive the quality of the voice of nina and the hot ""timber"". First thing i would like to do this morning was to buy the cd, but unfortunately is out of stock. I'll check daily until i find it and buy it. I suggest to anyone to do the same, my impression was really good, that friend is a Cd shop holder and he told me that this is the best one. May be will happen the same thata happened with Miles Davis or Michel Petrucciani: i've buyed one Cd under suggestion and in a few months i've bought more tha twenty each by myself. Try it."
2,Not so happy with the results....,"I've been using the CD for about two weeks now and so far no success. It does tell you to give it time to work by using it morning and night for several weeks. My chief complaint is that there's no instruction in the case about which tracks to use, how long each track is, etc... I also find the warning about copy right protection at the beginning of the CD annoying. If you set the CD to repeat (and since I'm never asleep by the end I do) it takes you out of the rhythm of trying to relax. The first track is supposed to put you to sleep and wake you up. That wasn't really my goal. I want to sleep. That's why I bought this. If you skip to what you think is the second track it turns out it's really the part of track 1 that wakes you back up. I haven't given up yet and I wasn't expecting a quick solution, but I'm starting to wonder if it will work."
2,"Kindle edition, not ready for prime time","On the first generation kindle, Venn diagrams don't reproduce correctly. On Kindle for PC, some symbols (implication, equivalence, etc.) don't reproduce correctly. It's easier to read on the PC, as indicated by the optimized for large screens flag, but without the symbols, it is pretty much impossible to make sense of. So I end up with the kindle on my lap, reading the symbolic material there, and the other material on the PC. Not fun."
2,Too Simple,"I bought this book to help me survive my Discrete Math class, and ended up thoroughly disappointed. It's just too simple to be of any use. The examples it goes over are the obvious ones I've never had any trouble with, but more involved problems or complex proofs are nowhere to be found in the text. In the end I ended up relying on my course text much more than this, and I already had that book to begin with."
4,This book is a Champion,"If this is really where we're heading just a short three hundred odd years from now, we better begin to do everything possible to bridge the gap between poor and wealthy, building the self esteem of our children and building a beautiful inward relationship with Christ. This book is eerily prophetic. I'm really impressed with how this author was able to take on such gritty matter as how bad it could be in the last days and balance it so well with the basic Christian principles that sometimes, in literature, seem like pablum. A sequal please!"
2,A Shallow Perspective,"This book has good information. Yet I frequently found myself staring at the pages in disbelief.The author states that in 1848 the population of California was several hundred. In fact there were thousands of Native Americans (tho many would be subsequently killed by white newcomers). This genocidal oversight admittedly caused me to cast a critical eye on the rest of the book.Still, with all the objectivity I can muster, the writing to me seems stodgy and halting, formal and uninspired, like someone published a research report. That's how the content feels too: the dots might be mostly there but few seem connected with analysis, commentary, or sense of humor."
3,Hidden In The Shadow's,"Melinda Metz takes Haunted to a new level with its suspense thriller. It's about a girl that gets framed and is sent to the nuthouse and later is released to go back to a prep school. She has a gift to read minds with a touch of her fingertips. The book gives good detail and drama. It tells a story about a girl trying to become normal again. I liked the book because it gives details, suspense, and you cant put it down till you finish it."
4,"""The Baby""","I was so excited to see I could find this movie. I am the ""baby"" at the end of the film. I was born at St. John's Hospital in Santa Monica and when the film crew needed a baby they came searching at the hospital. Unlike the ""red haired"" boy referred to in the movie, I was actually a blonde haired girl. But, what the heck!"
2,Huge disapointment.,"I was expecting alot better from Sennheiser.These are not my first Sennheiser 'phones but they are definetly the worst.These headphones are not terrible, but are no better than average either.The sound quality is so-so and the bass response they brag about is virtually non-exsistent.I'm sure You can get a much better product than this for $30+."
1,Cannot be played in U.S.,"This looks to be a great dvd but is in PAL format, (can't be played on dvd players in North America), therefore quite useless here. Amazon should have made this MUCH clearer. In fact their info is misleading as it says ""Region 1, US and Canada only."
1,Cannot be plated in U.S.,"This looks to be a great dvd but is in PAL format, (can't be played on dvd players in North America), therefore quite useless here. Amazon should have made this MUCH clearer. In fact their info is misleading as it says ""Region 1, US and Canada only."
3,Works Great for a Cheap Mask,It doesn't completely block out all the light but it does a pretty good job. Stays in place well.
1,its not what my wife thinks it should have been.,this product is not up to the part dont waist your money are your time paying for this really cheap product.
5,As advertised,Everything in the description matched the product. It arrived on time. Fits well - snug but not tight. Good product.
1,Would not recommend!,The strap is tight. I wore the mask with slightly damp hair and the black dye bled onto my sheets and stained them. Would not recommend.
2,sleep mask review,"While inexpensive, keep in mind that you are getting what you pay for with this product. My big complaint is that it isn't soft on the underside of the mask so it makes you sweat underneath it. It's not comfortable. I would reccomend spending a little more just to get a better product."
2,sleep mask,product inexpensive.LightweightSmooth material/comfortableFlimsy constructionnose material uncomfortableelastic band stretches out of shape easilyslips off face easilywould not purchase this product again
1,Cheap and Uncomfortable,This satin mask was very cheaply made and very uncomfortable to wear. This was very itchy and did not block all the light so it was useless to wear. Time to look for a different one.
2,Kinda Uncomfortable,"The mask works it keeps the light out of your eyes when it is lighted out and allows you to go to sleep. The bad part is, when worn is very uncomfortable I'm a side sleeper (I sleep on my side) and the straps that led behind your ears scratches the side of your head. I also feel the material made could have been thicker. Looking at the mask right now it is tearing along the outside of the mask. I supposed for $5 its okay, but I believe it could have been made better."
4,Does the job,"This little mask does the job, and the price is right. The description ""silky"" is fairly accurate - it's certainly not lined with silk or satin, but the material is comfortable and blocks out a sufficient amount of light. The two straps give a comfortable fit and aren't too tight.Paying a little more would give you something with higher quality, but if you just want to sleep in or adjust to the night shift a few days a week, I think this mask is just fine."
2,"Light goes through, poor quality","Light goes through from the middle/doesn't cover your nose properly. Poor quality, even for its price, especially in the summer it can really disturb you. Not worth buying."
1,"Terrible: poor quality, very cheap","Actual product is not how the website portrays it AT ALL. It's made of cheap material, is paper thin & smells like plastic. Very disappointing in quality. It's not ""silky"" nor ""soft,"" and to describe it that way is a misrepresentation of the product completely. It did not have 2 straps so I wonder if the picture used on Amazon is even the actual product itself. It comes in a thin plastic bag that's labeled ""Made in China."" Oh, and while I was writing this review I tried it again and the STRAP JUST BROKE OFF. DO NOT BUY!"
2,"It's cheap, but.....","Yes, this mask is cheap, but I found that it really doesn't work for me. The form fitting construction doesn't allow blinking and it's very annoying. Also, I've had the mask for about two weeks and the dainty straps are already fraying. I'll be spending a little more on the next one."
2,Light's On,My product came way before it's expected arrival date. Although it's comfortable to wear I was not really happy with this mask. The material is very thin and I can still see light when wearing it. I like the one I purchased at Wal-Mart a whole lot better. I would not purchase it again. I was very dissappointed!
5,Love It,"My husband bought this for me and much to my surprise..it's great! Light weight and soft. The head bands are comfortable and don't mess up my hair. It blocks the light better than other larger, heavier ones I've tried. I would recommend this mask."
4,Blocks out most of the light,"Fits snugger than others. If you have eye make-up on, do not use. Works for naps!:) I purchased for my husband, but I am the one that uses it. It blocks out most of the light."
2,plastic feel,"I thought the material felt more like plastic than a cloth material. The fit and size were both o.k. for me. I can not wear this for very long because the ""plastic feel"" makes it hot and uncomfortable."
2,Poor Quality,"This is described as far nicer than the reality. In truth, it's a plain piece of plastic with some elastic attached. It does keep out light, so I didn't give it 1 star, but it is not soft or silky."
2,Not comfortable,"This mask does its job but the material used makes you sweat, in short feels lake I'm using a black plastic bag over my face."
4,Nice basic sleep mask,"I was discouraged to buy this product because of the review about the mask being too tight, but it's so cheap that I decided to give it a try. Luckily, I found it to be very comfortable and I love that it is just a light, uncomplicated mask. One reason it works well blocking the light is because it's black. In the past I've had several other masks of different colors and I think it's best to always get it in black to have the most complete darkness. I just wish the fabric of this mask was a little bit more luxurious and had more of a satin, silky feel to it."
3,"OK for Traveling, Not Longterm","I was given a pair of these (new) Dream Essentials ""Snooz Silky Soft Sleep Mask"" by a very generous ""fellow traveler"" who noticed that I was having trouble sleeping on an early morning flight. These certainly did allow me to catch some extra sleep, but they are not going to work for me all of the time. Here are my observations:Pros -+ Inexpensive; these are fairly cheap so are almost disposable+ Small; can be easily put in PC case or suitcase pocketCons -- Light leaks in through the sides and, if bright enough, through the material- Directly touched the eyelids and eyelashesThese are much better than nothing and are handy to have on hand when needed, but will likely get a pair of contoured eye-masks as well (likeDream Essentials Sweet Dreams Contoured Sleep Mask with Earplugs and Travel Pouch ~ Black)CFH"
5,Does the job!,The price was right and I'm very happy with the way the mask blocks out light. It has a piece of fabric that fits nicely over your nose and is thick enough to block out light. I work midnights and sleep so much better during the day using this.
3,Adequate sleep mask,This eye mask is adequate and it is silky in a plastic way but I did not find it to be soft. The material is some kind of plastic feeling material. Mine only had one strap where the picture showed two. I have found that you really need the two straps for it to be comfortable. I was hoping for a mask that had a little padding but this had none. Someone else said the straps were too tight; I prefer tight straps to start because they stretch after use.
1,Horrible Product!!!!!!,"My mom asked for a mask to wear at night when she sleeps for Christmas so I figured I would order a few for her stocking.This is not a good sleep mask, I am disappointed in the reviews because I only ordered it because of the good reviews.It comes in an envelope, no box. It is wrapped in a plastic labeled made in China.It is not soft or smooth. it is so tight that the eye flaps flip up. My eyes feel like they are being squeezed tightly and I have a very small head. If you want something better try the Daydream Sleep Masks.JP"
1,MIA?,I can't really write a review on a product I never recived. It's been about three months now and still haven't gotten anything.
3,OK is a good way to describe it.,"It's a $6 item, you get what you pay for. Some light gets in from the bottom as the lip doesn't exactly fit the bridge of my nose. Other than that I have no other complaints and the item is VERY durable. I carry it around in my pocket and it gets all folded up and crinkled, however, shows no sign of damage or ware."
5,Great Product for the Price,"This product works very well for the price. I found that over time, the bands loosened, but not enough so that I couldn't use it. I'm ordering another one, just in case they stop manufacturing them."
5,A Classic Becomes a New Classic,"A true treat: de Souza and producer Nicola Conte offer 11 different takes on the songs from de Souza's critically acclaimed debut album ""Garota Moderna"" (""Modern Girl""). Hers is the sultry voice that evokes memories of the best Brazilian vocalists of the 1960's and their total passion for their craft and de Souza joined their ranks with the stunning premiere volume of her discography. With this disc, we are presented with remixes of those songs that offer an entirely new dimension to this now classic album. The reconstructions are accomplished by the likes of Zero db, Stateless, Big Bang, Buscemi, Dining Rooms, Raw Deal, The Truby Trio, Povo and more. Each is well known in the chillout community of remixers and they have each performed an invaluable service to music lovers everywhere. Highly recommended!"
2,lackluster,"I didn't particularly like the original album, and these remixes failed to rescue it for me."
4,Fabulous pictures,"great book if your looking for artistic pictures, just wonderful. But this is not a book for reading, just tells about the paintings and some have little poems."
4,Some gorgeous images inside...,"Almost all right-sided paintings are full pages and have a 5 star rate.On the left-sided pages are displayed some bw sketches.SPECIFICS:Page Count: 80Number of images: 66Small images: 31Half page images: 0Full page images: 302-page spreads: 5BW images: 29TEXT:2 page foreword1 page biographyTitle, size and year of each paintingComments on the paintings themeART:22 images: 5 stars12 images: 4 stars14 images: 3 stars18 images: 2 stars0 images: 1 starOverall: 4 stars"
4,A sensual & erotic study of Beauty and the Beast,"Secrets deals with sex in fantasy. This mind you is a good thing. Sex in fantasy is often ignored or sugar coated. Royo does not do that here. The artwork is excellent. While the woman that he paints are... well, of amazing beauty, the scenes that Royo has placed them in (with beings that at least appear to be of great evil possessing the ability for great destruction) make you seriously think about the ramifications of sex in fantasy. This is a book certainly worth having. I wish that more text explaining the artist feeling for each painting was included rather then the small cryptic/poetic statements. The artist did not hold back in depicting the subject matter and as such should probably not be considered for young readers or those offended by nudity."
5,Perfect gift,"This arrived on time, it was well wrapped. I was very pleased with this item. I plan to buy additiional items."
4,Smells so good,"My dad's friend bought this for me a couple Christmas's ago..I've warn it since. It smells so Lovely. It's very sexy, It's strong, and lasts quite a long time. I've gotten lots of compliments on it"
1,Nasty!,"This perfume was given to me for a CHristmas present. It smelled awful! The box appears large but the perfume bottle is tiny, and I mean tiny."
3,it's okay!,"My husband purchased this for my birthday a few days ago. I really like the smell but it fades quickly. You have to re-apply like after 30-40 minutes. That's the only disappointing issue, but a major one for me!"
2,Perfume 4 Stars/ Seller 2 Stars,I love the scent of baby phat goddess. The product is absolutely flawless and for a great price. I suggest everyone buy this product online instead of in stores because it will save you about 40%. I bought this product in Nordstorms and it cost $40.00 on sale. Make sure the shipper gives you exactly what you pay for. My boyfriend bought me this product from an amazon seller and he paid for 3.4 ounces but they only shipped him 1.7 ounces. The seller did deposit the difference back into his account but he wanted what he bought instead of the money. So I strongly suggest buyers make sure they contact the seller and confirm what will be shipped before their order has been processed.
4,AND A FAUX DIAMOND TO BOOT !,"Who's been described as ""Bold. Glamorous. Full Frontal Sexy""? Kimora Lee Simmons, of course. She's also an uber-babe who has turned the once dull tiny T-shirt Baby Phat line into a very contemporary array of styles worn by the hip and hope-to-be. Now, has introduced her first fragrance, an extension of the Baby Phat line, called Baby Phat Goddess.As unique as the woman herself, Baby Phat Goddess is a rich floral bouquet with op notes of pure gardenia, white rosebuds and cedrat flower. Now, what's sweet without sophistication? For that, there's a tad of black pepper.You know the bottle has to be something special, and it is - faceted and modeled after her rare Asscher cut diamond, complete with a faux diamond ring around the neck of the bottle.An impressive gift, although definitely not for Auntie Em."
4,Live album from master pop songwriter,"This guy has been overlooked for years, but that's no reason not to pick up this CD. A career-spanning selection of tunes, recorded live at club shows in 1998 and 2000, Showtunes shows Keene not only to be a sterling songwriter but also a kick-ass live performer. Do yourself a favor and buy this, then the rest of his hard-to-find back catalog."
3,lonesome road & look away,cd case was cracked when opening this package for a birhtday gift. Hopefully the cd did play ok... otherwise I would return it if it does not. Item arrived on time as scheduled.
4,A Greek Tragedy,"A childless couple, who host television shows, profess to have the ideal marriage which has now lasted fifteen years. The husband, who also has filmed documentaries, has been off to Greece recently to do one on ancient Greek war ships. On this particular trip, his wife did not accompany him. Upon his return, a Greek chef is murdered - later in the episode a young Greek woman, the chef's sister, is also murdered using the same M.O. A gentleman building a theme park in Britain, which will include full replicas of the Greek navel ships, and a Greek restaurant mogul are suspects. Along with the murders we find blackmail and kidnapping. You must bear down when viewing this entry as it is somewhat involved. Morse must do the same, but of course he ultimately unearths the culprit. This is quite a good four star effort."
3,Not that good,"nice book to put on the top of a coffee table but not a book for architecture references, as you cannot see the houses. The photograph had a lot of fun taking beautiful artful photos, but he forgot that we want to actually SEE the houses and not only the color of the walls and the views from the swimming pools (which are very beautiful indeed). Plans and panaromic photos of the houses would have been usefull. Sybille"
3,Ostfriesland,"It is a nice book about agreen landscape with traditions.The innocent area is described withbeautiful descriptions.The landscape described is a littlebit cold, monotone and not soamazing."
2,Wrong reading,"Perhaps I just got a faulty item, but the f-stop recommended by the Polaris was not even close when I was using a flash. It was, however, right on when using ambient light. This is a very simple meter to use. I read the directions in about 15 minutes, and was up and running in no time. Statistically, it seems this is a good light meter to go with. However, after my experience, I'll probably go with a bit higher quality model."
2,Failed after a short time.,"Well...first off; I liked this meter while it was working. I didn't like that I had to do the math to get the 1/10th stops to convert to 1/3rd stops but that's a small thing. I ended up not doing the math but just saying (mentally in my head) ""f/8 + 2 clicks"" to mean f/10 because that's the way the meter reads...in in 1/10th's with the 1/3rds marked out also. It's strange but it's not that big a deal.What IS a big deal is that this meter stopped measuring flash accurately. For some reason it just started going from registering (inaccurately) to not registering anything below a certain f/stop....nothing in between.I did like this meter while it worked (with the slight caveats that I mentioned above)and it works fine while it works.For myself, I should have spent the extra cash to get an L-358 because that's what I'm going to do now and I could have avoided a $160.00 lesson."
1,not accurate,"I got one of these light meters. Kept getting dark pictures, called amazon and got another. I assumed the first time was a fluke so have not opened it or used in for quite awhile. Just finally used it and its off as well!! By 2 stops!!!!! I had my suspicions confirmed by comparing my friends correctly exposed shot, and comparing the results of her Sekonic meter. Yep, 2 whole stops off. There is no polaris customer service so no company to even repair it. Im going to contact amazon and see if they will let me exchange it, very frustrated!! Will update after I talk to amazon."
5,Light Meter Very Important,"This light meter works great, even when your meter is conncected to your strobe flash for a meter reading.5/2/2011. The meter still works. I found some new tricks with this meter. If you find that you have problems with metering or it does not seem right, change your battery. The meter does a great job."
4,My own.,I am glad that I have my very own and it will be put to use. Photography has so much to offer.
5,Brilliant!,This is absolutely glorious. The remastering is stellar and the result is incredible. It sounds better than most things recorded today. The music is sublime as is the musicianship. Great all around recording and disc. I just wish it was longer...
5,Very happy with this book.,"I'm a high school student from Asia.I've learned the idiom ""toss your cookies"" from this book.I like the phrase ""beat it!"", hehehe...This book is awesome. It's worth the price.Thanks Longman."
4,Executive safe,This is a great product. It's just what the doctor ordered strong heavy and reliable and the price was excellent.
1,A Disappointment.,"A Disappointment.I found this movie/DVD to be very ephemeral. Bob, the main character, especially, was so shallow and untrusting of his own feelings that the movie just did not work. All grown up, no gay character took their relationship seriously. Maybe this film works for people in their 20's but not people in their thirties and forties. Sure, call it a comedy. I didn't laugh. Some of the acting was so rigid and stereotypical. The only saving grace in this movie was Guilermo Diaz, the straight savvy friend of Bob. His acting was believable. I was expecting something more mature. It was as funny as the Partridge Family is today."
2,Disappointed with this video,"Too many subplots. The writing wasn't very good. The only thing that redeemed this one for me was Tuc Watkins' hilarious performance as Sterling, and I liked Maddie Corman as well. Incidentally, if I were Bob, I would have chosen Sterling by a mile."
2,"Predictable, but gay","There's nothing in here that would be very interesting if it weren't for the whole gay angle. Alexis Arquette looks a little too caveman-like (the sloping forehead, the lazy jaw) to be the object of so much affection. The only one in the entire movie who seemed really gay to me was the groom! But despite all those negatives, I would still see it again for the performance of Christian Maelen. What is he doing lately?"
2,"I tried, I really tried to like this film...","But for the most part, these actors, (term used lightly), could not act their way out of a wet paper bag. Or was it the script writers that are to blame, because a lot of the script was, well...lame. The story idea was a good way to start this project, but it all just fell apart as this production kept playing. Jan. 2013."
1,Poor quality,Movie was good. Had seen it many times before. But the quality of the copy was without a doubt the worse of an rental I have ever downloaded from anyone
3,The movie is awesome...but this video sucks...,The video quality of this DL is abysmal. Get the disc and skip this video download. I requested a refund.
4,I think I do,"I Do I Think I Do is a delightful comedy. However, the audio is severely wanting, which is irritating at times during the viewing."
4,A real gem,Movies about people aren't made that much anymore. Movies about gay people aren't made that well or are few and far between. Usually we are the comic relief or the wacky sidekick but there is more to movies and being gay and this movie represents this. I really wish this would come out on DVD so more people could see it and own it.
1,Not worth it,If you have watched 20 minutes then you realize that you have gone too far. Save yourself the 20 minutes and find something else to watch.
5,Wonderful Movie,"Ok guys and Girls. This movie was great. Don't care what anyone else says. The movie is fun and holds yours interest all the way through the movie. Bob is just plan fun and Brandon, WOOF. The movie will have you laughing out loud. The parents of the bride are just a hoot. If I was you I run, not walk and get this movie. I have it on VHS and DVD."
5,If they only made more gay themed movies like this!,"One of the best ""gay"" movies I have ever seen. While the main character is gay and the plot revolves around his unfulfilled romance with his college room-mate the rest of the characters treat his homosexuality as if it is nothing out of the ordinary. It is really an inspired romantic situation comedy. Just a wholelotta fun movie. If you don't love you're warped!"
3,It will do the job,"My Celestron Star Pointer Finderscope came with my Celeston Nexstar 6 inch scope which I bought 2 years ago. The star pointer gets the job done for a very reasonable price. It is not hard to align to the scope and once aligned finds the target. I had to replace the original because I forgot to turn off the unit and the battery died. Also I accidently stripped a tightening screw on it. I would recommend this product, just be careful in handling it as it is made of plastic. If you do break it you are not out a lot of money."
4,"Works great, but.....","The rating is based on the units function. It does exactly what is claimed for it, and is easy to use. The only drawback is the method (glue) used to secure the adjustment dials to their screws . On my unit, the altitude dial broke loose from the screw due to glue failure, but I reattached it with superglue and it works well.I would recommend the star pointer to astronomy buffs."
4,Very attractive,"Easy to install. Replaced old style tly improved thewith shades for a pair of these, and they greatly improved the appearance of the room."
2,DON'T BUY!!,I bought this based on the glowing reviews (no pun intended) on this site. Very disappointed with the actual product. The two metal bars on the front were not even so that the glass is crooked and can't be straightened out. The whole thing reeks of cheapness. Other parts were flimsy. I can't imagine this would ever look good in my bathroom. Back it goes.
2,I expected more...,Nothing important was written. I do not recommend this book. You can find a better one.
4,Wiseguy TV series,I have all the season of Wiseguy. I love this series back in the 80 and still love it now. I Love Vinnie!!!!!!!!Ken Wahl in this series was awesome !!!!!!
2,A Glaring Oversight!,"I was thrilled when this set was released. True, it's way overpriced for one half of a season (the ALIAS box sets, for example, offer much more for the money)! But the video and audio are adequately restored and Kevin Spacey, in particular, and most everyone else makes it highly entertaining stuff. However, with this being the ONLY DVD I own that has neither closed captioning or subtitles, I find it to be a CHEAP release."
5,This Just Keeps Getting Better,The ability to watch all the episodes of the arc just adds to the presentation. The dolby digital sound is amazing. I really enjoyed the interviews with Kevin Spacey and the producers. The vision of the arc and the transition from Sonny Steelegravew was terrific. I can only hope that the remaining arcs will be distributed as well as the few final episodes with Steven Bauer that were never aired
3,"People, people......calm down!","I researched and read reviews for both the ESPN and EA Sports college basketball titles. Everyone has a different opinion. The simple truth is that you will have to judge for yourself. First of all, you must ask yourself the following question: What do I look for in a game?If you buy a game based purely on looks, then graphically speaking, ESPN has the advantage this year. If you buy a game based on the control and how it plays, then EA Sports is the game for you this season.I bought March Madness because of my familiarity and history with NBA Live, and after 13 games of a dynasty season, I have not been disappointed. The game plays well, there are good options, and the excitement of the college game is there.Is it the best basketball game ever? No. Is it going to win any awards? Probably not.BUT...Is it a fun game to play and does it have good replay value? Yes, definitely.Hint: I bought my copy of March Madness at a game trade-in shop and got a great deal!"
2,Settle Down,"This is not the greatest game ever, as some would like you to believe. This is an OK BBall game. Forget all the great crowd chants and mascots. Over time we all know it's about gameplay. This one is OK. Not even good but OK. I am off to try ESPN, let's hope it's better."
4,SWEET Game,"This game was just what I was looking for. I was reading some other reviews and got kind of nervous because they were saying that this game was sorry. Im glad I got it. The game play is great and the Dynasty mode if fantastic. However, if you enjoy creating teams and players, and want a game just because you like to do that, this is not the game for you. There are about 5 team colors and you dont get to make your uniform like in NCAA Football. The school creating really sucks. But all other parts of the game I love. Great announcing, gameplay, and graphics. I LOVE this game."
2,Rent it before you buy it,"Allright, I have been an EA sports fan for quite a while now, and because of that, there have been times where I have bought crap that I thought was good because of their name. This leads to this game, I love their football games, Considering that I thought that maybe this game was going to be close to their NCAA College football game, which I cant stop playing; But its not, it's graphics and sound are a good 4/5, but the gameplay and dynasty mode are horrible, its just not fun playing, because sometimes it seems that I have no control of the outcome of the game, please, there are better games to invest your money than this game, so rent it, and learn from my mistake"
1,Stick with Espn,"I walked into the gamestore with 2 options, Espn college hoops or March Madness 2004. I picked March madness just because the makers were Ea Sports.I also liked their college football game. Now when I got home andopened and played March Madness I was really dissapointed. I like simulation games and this is far from it. This game is 100% arcade. I am currently in the process of returning it and buying Espn College hoops 2004.Bottomline: If you are seeking a pure simulation game go with Espn.If you are looking for pure arcade go with March Madness."
1,NOTHING SPECIAL MORE A WASTE OF MONEY,this game is nothin to get excited about the graphics are nothin close to impressive and they wuld b closer to horrible if u ask me the gameplay also does not run smoothely it is not even close to what it is like to watch college basketball it very closely resembles nba live 2004 only the gameplay it looks and feels like the pro game with worse graphics and worse gameplay i wuld tell u to go and buy nba live 2004 rather than waste your money on this nba live is the same game with better graphics dont buy this !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,NCAA March Madness 2004,This game is the best college game ever made. If you don't have it you should get it right away.
4,Awesome!!!!!!,This is the best college basketball game. It has good graphics and the freestyle is great. Crowds go wild with real life chants.
5,Just get it!,"I was lucky enough to live in Columbus for a few years and got to see PMM in action. After listening to their latest CD (Thanks Jon!) I sat there thinking, ""damn, these guys are good"". Famous Past Lives is their best yet. Listen to this album and you'll wonder why these guys are not huge already. Awesome melodies combined with excellent songwriting makes PMM a band to follow. Great album! And if you ever get a chance to see them live don't miss it. This is not your usual ""local band""....always worth the price of admission. Wish I were back in Columbus to hear them more."
3,Okay,"It's a little frustrating after level 6, but if you enjoyed Jewel Quest, you should enjoy this."
1,Buyer Beware!!,"I bought this game for Christmas, only it doesn't work unless you have a processor of at least 800Mhz. I found this out the hard way, I have a processor that's a pentium 3 with 662Mhz. So if you buy this product find out all of the system requirements from somewhere else, because they aren't listed here on the product page."
4,Atlantis Quest,"This game is perfect for adults who show early onset Alsheimer's. My husband never tires of it and I have noticed an improvement in his level of concentration. He never gets bored with it, and feels excited to challenge himself to do better and better. I think nursing homes would do well to purchase this game for their entertaiment rooms. The grandkids get a kick out of it as well - maybe they want to see if they ""beat"" grandpa's score. It is good, clean fun. I prefer it with the sound off - but that might be because it is on endlessly at our home."
2,Was hoping for something different and a little more fun!,"When I purchased this game there were hardly any reviews about it and the ones that were on here all said the game was fun so I bought the game. Needless to say when it finally arrived in the mail I downloaded it on my computer and began to play.... only I didnt find it to be fun.... it was like poppit to me. It's a fun game if your into that kind of thing, but I was looking for something more then just puzzle after puzzle. I like the games when you are actually the character and are having to complete task.... like the laura croft tomb raider legend game. Anyway I completed the game only because I hate leaving anything unfinished and now it sits in my drawer collecting dust. I will never play it again. I found it to be very boring after so many levels of the same thing."
2,Just ok,"I tried out clippers right away when I got them. They where just ok, took a lot of power to cut through any branches of an size (1/4"" or larger) on bushes I was working on. They will probably work ok for clipping new groth this summer."
3,"Ignore the ""Air Filter"" description, this is the oil filter that matches the part number.","I cautiously bought this here, since my local auto parts store wanted 1 week and 3x the price for the same item. At the time of purchase, and this review, the description on Amazon is: ""FRAM PH8476 Air Filter"" This is however, the Fram PH8476 OIL Filter I was looking for. Same as the others I had on the shelf and works fine.If it matters to you, this model doesn't come with the rubber coating, regardless of where it is purchased, so the picture here depicting that is inaccurate as well."
3,Nice size.,"I recently bought this item as a gift.I was pleased with the size of the feeder given its price.The beads used on this product look a bit cheap, especially for a gift.The overall design is nice and it seems well constructed.I hope that it holds up.The packaging came a bit banged up, but the product was safely nested in Styrofoam."
5,All The Way To Lhasa,"Love this book, so does my Daughter. I've read it to her hundreds of times and I still enjoy the zen-ness of this book. Great twist on an age old tale."
5,Get this now before it's gone,"use that credit card as fast as you can. Ifo you liked Robotech, you need to get this collection before it's gone"
4,Great news for fans,It is a great treat for fans. Its just great to hear all those songs that made me rush home from school early
2,Wears Out,"This is the second one i used in 2 years. They rot out at the flange and the hanger bracket. They do have a guarantee, so remember to save your receipt! Still you must be willing to replace it often, and find an authorized dealer to replace it."
2,Dissapointing,"Promised so much, delivered a flyer for the use of professional fund managers and the use of his proprietry indicators. If only he had divulged a little more about the indicators he uses and a little less of the obvious - such as the idea that if you can make sure you are not in the stockmarket during the worst performing periods you should do better than if you have a buy and hold strategy."
2,"Like a bad movie, that you needed to finish","As a sole-proprietary trader, I found this too basic. He should retitle the book to ""why you need to market-time (but not how to market-time)""Geeze, what a disappointment! But, the good thing to come out of this was reading my own thoughts that I had come up from years of experience. He did a good job of summarizing my own unsubstantive knowledge. Maybe, I will find substance in the area of finance called ""market timing"" (not to be confused with asset allocation or technical analysis as it so often is) in some other book... Why did he get 2 stars? He is graded on a curve. I have read worse. If you are desperate for this book as I was, promise yourself to return it, if you don't like it."
5,"A Good Book, not a Cookbook","This is not a cookbook of recipes for the ""do it yourself"" investor, but a great book full of insight into the age-old argument between the ""buy-and-hold"" academic crowd and the ""risk-management"" oriented real-world crowd. Mr. Sosnowy gave investors fair warning ahead of time about the market debacle in 2000. I believe that his philosophy can help many other investors achieve ""Lasting Wealth"" in the years to come. I recommend this book highly!"
1,You Need Help,"This book basically says to hire a professional to handle your accounts. The use to the average investor looking for information on the ""hows and how nots"" of getting into and out of investments is minimal. I came away frustrated with this book."
1,They break easy,"They appear to be great in electronic noice cancelling and covering your ear to isolate some sounds too. They are very frim on your head and after some time wearing them they become uncomfortable. For great isloation i used ear plugs and then wore them and it was very quiet. I think the ear cups should be larger and softer to mould the ear more and subsequently isolate the external sounds better.THE MOST IMPORTNAT THING: The swivel that connects the ear cup to the head band breaks - it cannot be repaired. I would not buy this product again, for the price i expect better quality."
3,Just don't sit on it!!!,"This is the second set of Solitude's that we have owned. We really like the product so after we lost the first pair we bought another. This pair was sat on in the plane and a small piece of plastic broke off the ear piece separating the ear piece from the headset and now it is worthless. The electronics still work but when I called the company I was told that they have ""no extra parts available"" and don't provide repair referral or information. Not very customer friendly since now I have to order a whole new set. Think we'll try Bose this time."
4,Great history & insight,I liked that some of the less famous drivers got mentioned. Good history & some great stories.
2,Wan't Happy With It,"I didn't like this James Bond game as much as others in the past. It wasn't a traditional Bond game, the first person shooter that I was used to and liked was changed to 3rd person which I hate. The levels are extremely hard even on operative mode. I `m not very happy with it!"
3,It's Good,"I honestly love the game, many people say it is no challenge, but i would have to dissagree.if you actually try to get all the awards and everything, it seems almost virtualy impossible even with a players guide. none the less it is an incredible singleplayer game, multiplayer on the other hand is brutal, co-op is physically impossible, and the battle mode sucks. not as good as the other games but still pretty good."
4,Sophisticated and addicting,"This is a great shooting game. However, the one thing I do not like about it is that you cannot talk to people on the internet during a game. In order to talk, you need to buy the USB Headset which can cost $25-$40. If you have more than one online game, like SOCOMII or Champions of Norram: Realms of Everquest, than it is worth it to buy the USB Headset. If you own one of the other James Bond games, like Nightfire, then this game would be great for you. The multiplayer isn't great, but not bad either. It could use a little work and give you some more locations. Even though it costs $50, it was well worth my money. It will be well worth your money too. Send an email to blitzball18@yahoo.com with questions about James Bond or any other games or accessories."
3,"Best EA Bond Game, but not Best Bond Game, or best shooter!","Sure it is a great game, but not the best. ... The driving missions are tight using NFS engine, and the game has great graphics and shooter elements, but it dosen't match up to Goldeneye. ... The game has a lackluster terrible multiplayer aspect. ... But EoN is the best Bond adaptation, b/c its great presentation, but no it is not a better game! ..."
3,GOD THIS GAME [....],OKay the driving is insane which got it 3 stars its awesome but then the arenas are RETARDED. U never no what tha hell ur doing and if u thing runing around in the dark and u can't see and u can only use heatvision is annoying as CRAP u just randomely run around in the dark hoping u go to where u want. This game would be awesome if they made better arenas [...]
1,rating,i did not like it because it was boring and i did not like it because there was a guy who killed an other guy and then another guy killed him and it was boring and i thought this game was boring and it was boring and dumb.
3,Entertained game,"I don't like to write very much, but I can tell you that this game serves to be entertained for a while."
3,Average at best,"This first thing you will say about this game is that it would probably work on the big screen. The story line is tasteful, some lines are cheasy, but hey, its a Bond game anyway, right? However, the play control was extremely lacking, and it was enough to deter me from the game. I also didn't think it was making any ground breaking results either. It was almost too much like playing a cheap rip off of Splinter Cell or Metal Gear Solid 2. Not to say this game is not fun by any means. It was just one of those where I went, ""I've done this before in other games, so what's new here?""I only rented the game, and I am glad I did. If you are an extreme Bond fan I would recomend it. However, if you have played any other game of this genre, don't expect to be blown away. I wasn't at least."
3,"Not BEST Bond Game, not Better than Goldeneye","Sure it is a great game, but not the best. ... The driving missions are tight using NFS engine, and the game has great graphics and shooter elements, but it dosen't match up to Goldeneye (Shut up, reviewers, you know as well as I do that Goldeneye is MUCH better). ... The game has a lackluster terrible multiplayer aspect. ... But EoN is the best Bond adaptation, b/c its great presentation, but no it is not a better game! ...The worst part of it all is that EA is publishing Goldeneye 2 (NO! not EA again, I want Bond like before!). Oh well, at least there's TS3 to look forward to, but EA is making that too, let's just buy an XBOX and get PD ZERO."
1,Terrible!!!!!,"This game is terrible!!! Don't buy it. Nothing like Nightfire or Goldeneye. Mulitplayer sucks, Co-Op sucks, no codes at all, can't even play mulitplayer until you beat the first level of Co-Op, and even so, the multiplayer is awful, and you cant even play as Bond or anyone, you get four little jack off guys, whopee. No bots, no different multiplayer modes, no anything. Don't buy this game or you be extremely dissapointed like I was."
4,James Bond strikes again,"Well, one of the reasons this game is good is because of the graphics.And, you dont just look at your gun, you see your own character.You also get to go on missions with one of your friends, but there are only three chapters for 2-p missions.But they are very hard.Id give about 3 stars for 2-p.But one thing cool is that you get a cloaking device.Well thats all I have to say about this game.Oh, one more thing, you get to drive cars, motor cycles, and a helicopter.Well, Good Bye.:>"
3,I kinda miss the 1st person shooting.,"The great thing about this game is it's more.... well just better fighting and shooting. Even though you don't have 1st person you can punch, and just do cool stuff. I miss the 1st person but in a way I like this more. Well nightfire is also a good game but after playing this, it makes it look a bit crude. Well, anyway it is a new way of 007, and some players will not like the change, but it has pros and cons. it solves many problems that Nightfire/ Agent under Fire has, but also destryos what makes 007... well, 007!"
4,a nice read,"While shorter than Meyer's First Holmes Pastiche (The Seven Per Cent Solution), the West End Horrors is a much better book. Meyer still uses real figures (Oscar Wilde, Bernard Shaw, and Bram Stoker etc), which is silly and seems like a poor attempt at making Holmes less fiction and more reality. And while this volume doesn't have any action sequences like ""Seven Per Cent"", it is an excellent mystery that puzzles the reader until it builds to an intriguing and believable climax.One thing that the buyer should take note of is that this is not ""The White Chapel Horrors"" (Sherlock Holmes vs. Jack the Ripper) as many reviews have confused the two.The West End Horrors is a really well-written Holmes Pastiche. I am looking forward to reading Meyer's Latest Holmes offering, the Canary Trainer."
3,Doesn't burn all the way down . .,"This is such a wonderful scent! But I was SO disappointed that it quit burning with about an inch of candle left (the metal piece in the middle prevents wax going any lower). I know that doesn't sound like a lot - but since it burns pretty slow, it kinda is:) And since these candles aren't on the cheap side - every bit of wax counts. I won't be buying anymore and that's too bad because the scent is so nice."
4,Great Little Candle,"For the price this is a great buy. It burns smoothly without smoking The scent is strong without being overbearing. It does a great job of scenting a large area. I've purchased other candles that were significantly more costly and nowhere as good. My only wish is that it was in a more decorative jar. However, this hasn't detered me from stocking up on the item."
2,unexpectedly bad,"These candles do not smell like lavender AT ALL, they just smell perfume-y. I've been happy with other MM products, but these were really disappointing."
1,Possibly carcinogenic,"Use this product at your own risk. It contains BHT, which may or may not be a carcinogen. Probably not a good idea to inhale it. Because it is not a food product, the manufacturer -- Caldrea -- is not required to list BHT as an ingredient. They should."
4,"Real cool, versatile & stylistic (4&1/2 stars)",The soundtrack is fantastic with alot of arrangements from the horns & strings. And strong rhythm section. The title them was the Smash which been sampled by a couple hip-hoppers. Barry White (RIP) deserves this piece of work credit. One heckuva performer and one legend truly left us too early. This is a great score even I haven't seen the original movie of it. Long lives the Maestro and Overall Genius of Barry White.
2,Average,while I'm a Big Barry White Fan(RIP) this SOundtrack was pretty average&seems like Barry didn't bring the Goods fully here.the title track was catchy but after that it sounds like a Left-Over Project from other better Produced Soundtracks by Other Composers&Producers.Barry White brought the Musical Pain but not on this Set.
3,Maybe it sounded better in '74...,"Inasmuch as I am a huge fan of ""The Maestro"", I have to admit that the score to ""Together Brothers"" is one of his weakest compositions.Repetitive, unoriginal, and missing the sultry sound that so categorizes White's music, the score's only strong suit is the fact that the theme was later recycled in the 90's dance hit ""Come and Ride This Train"" by Quad City DJ 's.It's too bad that the remainder of the album is so forgettable.But, it is Barry; thus, I can't give him less than three stars."
1,A horrible movie,"I am still in dis-belief after viewing this terrible excuse for a movie. James Dean,was such an icon,seeing him portrayed by such an incapable actor discusts me. Casper Van Dein doesn't even attempt to give a good performance.He says his lines with no emotion. Diane Ladd is just plain goofy,as is Connie Stevens.(possibly laughable). I also hated the way Sal Mineo and Natalie Wood were portrayed.This film has no respect for the dead,and in return,should get no respect from the living."
4,Flawed but very enjoyable.,"Although flawed in some ways, in all I really loved this movie. It was authentic in its recreation of the Porsche Spyder accident that claimed James Dean. Great music and sound, especially in the flashbacks, race sequences and final scene. Casper Van Dien seems to be the perfect actor to portray Dean and Diane Ladd was great as the mother of Pier Angeli. Good date movie!"
1,CRAP!,"Casper Van Dien needs to go back to the monkeys,and stick to acting in ""Tarzan"" movies,as he cannot act his way out of a paper bag! Starring as James Dean,he is plain horrible,not to mention insulting to the legend of James Dean..and Diane Ladd? Well,she gives new meaning to bad wigs,phoney accents,and horrible acting! But we all knew her credibility was over,years ago,when she gave birth(discustingly graphic) to a dinosaur in that other horrible film,""Carnisaur"". Obviously,Ms.Ladd is desperate to take on ANY roll she can get these days! This film's negatives should be destroyed! POOR GARBAGE!"
1,very bad film,"This movie is beyond bad! It is one of the worst movies I have ever seen! Poor directing,and terribly acted.James Dean deserves respect,and this film certainly gives him none!"
1,a MESS!,"This is just a horrible mess of a movie! As poor as they come! A ""Z"" grade movie! The casting couldn't be worse,and the acting is so very bad! Casper is a terrible James Dean,just laughable.Diane Ladd was,well,rediculous,in my opinion.When she stomped her feet yelling,""no no go"",in that bad wig and fake accent, I fell off the sofa in hysterical laughter! The storyline is very thin,and the whole production is a flop of a movie! Not to mention the slanderous treatment of Natalie Wood,and Sal Mineo.Unprofessional! On a scale of 1-10,10 being the best,I give this film a ""ZERO"""
2,but the music is good,"i have to agree with the other reviewers for the most part this movie stinks. With the possible exception of Robert Mitchum the acting is horrid and the movie very inaccurate. James Dean was not madly in love with Pier Angelli and in fact broke off the relationship with her. In the movie the reverse is true. On the plus side the music, at least the songs by Gordon Waller are excellent if you like mid 50s music or are a Peter and Gordon fan. You may consider buying the soundtrack 'Race With Destiny"" if you can find it. I give it 4 stars, fron what i have heard from the movie."
4,Greatest Love Story Of all time,"I really enjoyed this movie, it helped ignite my love for Jimmy. I had never heard of Jimmy or Casper before I seen this movie, therefore I Originally had no bias what so ever, I did go on to read his biography and research him greatly after viewing the movie. Once done this I watched the movie again and I must say I still enjoyed it, yes I admit there was sum really odd things about the acting and portrayal of Jimmy however there was that intence look and voice that Casper Portrayed oh so well!!! (the name change for the us premiere was not well thoughtout)"
3,"CVD makes a good, if somewhat unbelievable, James Dean","I have recently purchased this video after first seeing it on Romance Classics. I have found the story to be somewhat plausible. Casper Van Dien seems to have done a lot of research in his portrayal of the skyrocketing '50s screen idol. Robert Mitchum, as George Stevens (not Cukor), still was able to zap the audience with his presence, even though it was evident he was terminally ill. His granddaughter Carrie (then Mrs. Van Dien) made an interesting and convincing Pier Angeli. Diane Ladd was at her nastiest since ""Carnosaur"" as the spiteful Mama Pierangeli. The only person who I found extremely unconvincing and untalented was Louis D'Alto. His performance as Vic Damone did not win me (or any of my friends who saw this movie) over. His singing (sans music) and acting was flat. This film may not have been Oscar caliber, but still convincing enough to bring the ill-fated young actor back to life."
1,A big time stinker!,"This film has got to be the single, most atrocious bio-pic ever put on film. I'm not exagerrating when I venture to say that it is one of the very worst films I have ever seen and I've seen many. This poor excuse for a movie focuses on mostly on the love affair between James Dean and Pier Angeli. The acting is awful. Casper Van Dien is laughable as James Dean. He tries but fails big time. Diane Ladd, who plays Mama Angeli, hits an all-time low. The competent, often excellent actress gives an amazingly terrible performance and happens to sport the single, most awful Italian accent ever in the history of movies. It's not just the acting that stinks but also the sloppy editing, the horrid direction, the stupid script and the laughibly lame songs that fill the soundtrack. This whole abomination has to be seen to be believed!"
1,"Poorly made,low-budget garbage","As James Dean's cousin,and a friend of Sal Mineo's,I can confirm that this film is not only poorly researched,but full of lies.But even as a fictional film, it could have served as entertaining, but this mess is so poorly scripted,directed,edited,and acted,it's a wonder the film was ever made.Definatly one of the worst movies I have ever seen.Casper Van Dein is laughable as James Dean,as is Diane Ladd's performance as Piere Angeli's mother.It is sad that an Acedemy Award winning actress,now accepts roles in such low-budgeted disasters such as this.She doesn't even keep her accent through-out the film,going in and out of character.Seriously,as a relative of James Dean,this is insultive.As a movie fan,It is a waste of film. Not even worth one star."
1,An insult to Jimmy!,"This film is extremely insulting to the memory of James Byron Dean, and attempts at presenting a ""cool-legend"" other than how Jimmy actually was. Bad, bad, bad stuff right here. Please, ... Casper? (I can't believe I can't get work acting (I look more like Jimmy than he does), this performance was pathetic and one-dimensional.) For a great and multi-layered portrayal of how Jimmy was check out ""James Dean"" starring James Franco (a role in which he won several awards). While the TNT film may have some factual slip-ups here and there, it does not romanticize and idealize James Dean. It presents Jimmy as a lonely boy with vast emotional problems searching for acceptance and love. (Which is exactly who he was)..."
1,shockingly bad,"I was very shocked at how bad this film is.Bad acting,bad directing,bad editing,bad writing,and the list goes on and on. Thumbs down! WAY DOWN!"
1,BOMB! Arguably the worst film ever made.,"I went into this expecting (at least) a halfway decent direct-to-video, or made-for-cable film; what I watched was a ghastly mishmash... poorly directed; poorly acted; poorly edited; just: poor! To anyone interested in Dean, this video is an insult (and to add insult to injury, the ""filmmakers"" dedicated the film to Dean in the end credits!!) And to think that this was Robert Mitchum's last film (and he does look very ill in the small part he played [as George Cukor] toward the end); that just adds to the travesty. Anyone looking to shell out the asking price to own this film: caveat emptor! Beware, at all costs!"
1,HORRIBLE FILM!,"This movie is the worst piece of exploitation I have ever seen..Casper's performance is ALFUL! Not only does he look NOTHING like Dean,but he makes weird constipated faces throughout the film,and emotes ZERO emotion.Dianne Ladd shows non of the talent she is famous for.Her daughter,Laura Dern,should have talked her out of this mess.Not to mention the disrespectful,false representation of the legendary SAL MINEO,and NATALIE WOOD. This movie is DEFINATLY the worst film I have seen,since ""Attack of the killer tomatoes"""
2,Cheaply made,"While lots of light gets blocked out, the elastic strap broke off one side within the first week. I had to knot it to hold it in place. You get what you pay for."
4,EA has lost it's mind,"Great game, but EA needed to add XBOX Live to spark any real interest from 2003 owners. I rented this title and the improvements are interesting, but not enough to get my $50. With all the other Sport and First person games going the way of LIVE, I cant think of one excuse for this title not to be. They missed out on the cash cow, heres hoping for 2005."
4,This game rocks!!!,This game is really addicting. There are so many different modes to play that I never get bored. The graphics could get better but I am just picking at the small stuff. Overall this is the best golf game I have ever played.
3,Multi-Player Tournament Mode Is Gone!,"Game is pretty much the same as last year's version, with one major exception. The multi-player tourney is gone, which means that there's no easy way to earn money with friends. This was a bad move..."
4,awesome if it's your first,"If you own 2003 then you will be a natural at 2004. It eliminates the learning curve. While this is an enjoyable game, once you have completed the world tour, the game starts to get dull. It is cool to play the PGA season, but it is not very challenging...finishing -40 or -60 is not very hard. You can easily get so far ahead of the field on the first day of the tournament, but you still have to play the other three days, with no competition it kind of sucks.The next game should have an increase if difficulty as the season goes on, not just be a little longer or difficult pin placement. Also, you are playing by yourself in the tourny mode, while quicker, the competition seems non existant.I' probably rent 2005 before I buy it!"
3,A dissapointing step down from 2003,"I became completely addicted to the 2003 version of this game. This new one doesn't seem to have the same polish as last year's. Turn the commentating off - it's just flat out bad (relative to 2003, anyway). Same goes with the music. Next year I will try a different brand if this trend continues. Save your $$ and just buy a used copy of 2003 or try something else."
1,The Tiger of 2004 in game form,"Players are not different enough cause you only get Tiger.I dislike how putting is done.Too many arcade elements for a ""sim"" game.CPU AI is not worth playing against."
2,"Great game, but spend your $$$ on 2003","I just picked up TW Golf 2004 and think it is a great game...BUT, and a big one at that, why spend the money when 2003 is 1/2 the price and there are not that many changes.So what is new in '04 - you can create a player with so many options, it is sickening. you will use this feature once, and never again.If you are someone that wants to open the game and play, then get 2003. If you want to mess around with designing the shape and size of your players mouth for 20 minutes- TW 2004 is for you...I also don't understand why they took away the option for 2 people compete in the tournaments. It was such a great feature on 2003, and a quick way to earn money.and why oh why did they not make it part of xbox live?Overall i would say it is a great game, but i recommend you save $25 and buy TW 2003 instead of 2004."
2,way too easy,The game is way too easy. It is very difficult to miss a fairway. Chip shots stop unrealistically quick. Putting simple as well. Graphics are great though. A good looking game but not realistic.
2,"PGA TOUR 2003, much better version","I was greatly impressed with Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2003. I could not wait for 2004. Well to my dismay, I found 2004 version to be 90% like the 2003 version. The competitors were pretty much the same. The designers were really lazy in that they could not even come up with new golfers or new clothes for the old golfers to wear. There are a couple new courses but nothing to write home about They used 90% of 03 then added 10% new for 04. The music in 03 is better, you can actually see the stats/yardage better on 03. They tried to add a few new items on 04 but is not worth spending money on the newer version. Stick w/ 03 and save 1/2 your money."
5,OSHA approved!,"I bought this for my wife as a joke to go along with her little pink toolkit... turns out this hard hat isnt a joke at all... its a real OSHA approved, ANSI standard, so on and so on, real Useable Hard Hat. I put it on and its quite comfortable too. Cant beat its price either!"
4,Work in style,"I bought this OSHA compliant pink hard hat so I could cut down the branches of my tree more safely. It has a Standard Slide-Lock suspension and fit is easy to adjust by sliding the plastic strap through the guide tabs. There is cushioning along the brow of the hat for comfort.The hard had is lightweight but looks tough and durable. It's pretty; but I also bought the hot pink version and I think the hot pink is prettier.Overall, a great find for me. I can do the job in style with full protection."
4,Pink Hard Hat,For the price this is a nice hard hat. It was purchased for a costume party and arrivedhere in plenty of time. Thank you
4,"Sometimes erotic, sometimes surreal","""The Shadow: Thirteen Stories in Opposition"" is an intriguing collection of short stories by Panamanian writer Enrique Jaramillo Levi. The collection has been translated into English by Samuel A. Zimmerman.Many of the author's stories have a surreal or fantastic element to them, and some deal with erotic themes. The best of the bunch are ""Water,"" the quirky story of a magician who kidnaps a teenage girl and trains her as his assistant; ""The Photograph,"" a kinky tale of voyeurism and brotherly bonding; and ""The Honeymoon,"" a bizarre story that is humorous, horrific, and sexual all at once. All in all, a collection well worth reading, especially for those with an interest in Latin American literature."
5,If you want to make a difference in your life,"I'm so excited! IF YOU WANT TO KNOW MORE ABOUT HEALTH ISSUES AND FOOD, FOOD AND HOW IT DIRECTLY AFFECTS YOUR BODY, MOTIVATION to get up and DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT(you know what I'm talking about), this is the best gift you could give yourself. I'm dead serious. Grab this book before it is truly gone...Susan Powter speaks up from personal experience and so am I."
5,Love these brushes,As a hairstylist I find these brushes indispensable. I have all the sizes and would recommend them to any other stylist or for individual usage.
3,Good Tuner - Bad Antenna,The tuner is great...works well...good image.But consider buying it only if you have 1GB or so of RAM..works with 512MB but occassionally gets stuck. The antenna leaves a lot to be desired..a pretty flimsy contraption at best. They could do with improving antenna quality.
4,What you would expect,"This was actually a good piece of hardware, it does what it advertises. I picked up a couple of HD channels, ppl have been complaining about the software but i used Vista Media Center which accepted it with no hassle. Though it does get hot after a couple of hours of use, but that's expected in a tuner."
3,great for what it does,"This produces very clear pictures and I really like it. But I don't know how the alternatives perform. However, the issues I've observed are:- gets REALLY hot and can't use for very long- works WORSE when you plug in the antenna"
3,product review,The Pro-Tec Athletics knee patellar tendon strap size medium was too small for a size medium. I am a woman at the proper weight/height ratio and a medium should do the trick rather than a large which would normally fit someone larger. I basically can't use the strap and just put it in a drawer.
5,Magic band,"We 65 year old runners sometimes need help. Having seen many others used this for knee pain relief, I figured I""d try it. I coupled it's use with leg strengthening exercises, and all pain is gone. I'm not sure if I need to keep using it,and the exercises may have been what corrected the problem, but why mess with success? I""d highly recommend the experiment. For the price, what do you have to loose?"
3,"Good, but not Great","This product came as it was supposed to and I was happy that this occurred because I have been somewhat skeptical of Amazon purchases in the past.I would like to warn all potential buyers of two very important things regarding this Patellar Tendon Strap:a) Even though I measured my calf/knee area according to the Pro-Tec website and ordered accordingly this product is slightly too big for me Note - ORDER A SIZE SMALLER THAN YOUR KNEE.b) This unfortunately is not the most firm patellar tendon strap I have tried on before, I suppose you get what you pay for however in the future I will definitely be looking at Straps that have substantially more strength in the product."
3,Okay product,"The Tendon Strap was okay. It has ended up more as a bother than a help. When I bend my knee at work, or even driving the car, the strap comes undone. No ones fault, just the way the product is when your legs a larger than what the designer allowed for with the size."
1,Infinite Stretching,"They used the wrong fabric in creating this patellar strap. The fabric that wraps behind your knees is too elastic. It gets skinnier with tension like a rubber band, meaning that it will lengthen, and you will lose tension. The strap width is 1.5 inches wide, but the rear part had stretched down to a half-inch wide after less than a kilometer of walking.Where did that other inch go? It stretched into the overall length, and with it went the tension.Patellar straps are relatively cheap (compared to full-blown braces), so I'm not crying a river, I'll continue to use the Mueller."
3,ok at first,"I got this for basketball as I believe I have developed jumper's knee (my knee gives out when I try to jump). When I first got it worked great. Really did do a great job at first. I felt great jumping, running, was able to go 100% and felt like I had gotten my legs back. However after no more than ten uses it began to lose its effectiveness. It was no longer as strong as when I had first used it. The inner piece that applies pressure to the knee got softer after a few uses and I found that I kept tightening it more to apply the necessary pressure and the size no longer fits the same. I got the med and now I probably could use a small as it had stretched. Good but not great. If it felt like I the first time I had used it everytime I used it then it would be great but it is losing its effectiveness and I am concious of my knee as I was before I bought this as my knee slightly feels a slight give if I push hard enough off it. But for the cheap price its acceptable."
4,Good but make sure you get the right size!,"It's not on the Amazon item page, but the sizes are as follow:Small 10"" - 12"" (circumference of the leg just below the knee)Medium 12 1/8"" - 13 5/8""Large 13 3/4"" -15 1/2""XL 15 5/8"" -17 1/2""I am a large in almost everything else so I ordered a large of these straps. But it was barely big enough, I should have gotten an XL. So you might want to size up a little."
5,It Works!,"I am really pleased with this product. I own the Nike and the McDavid's version of the runner's knee brace and this Pro-Tech far surpasses them on comfort and ease of getting the brace fit quickly. This brace feels very good and you don't notice it as you run. The Pro-Tech brace stays comfortable even on 26.2 mile run, and that is saying something! It does not cut off your circulation like the Nike one does and it far more easy to get a comfortable fit than the McDavid. I am ones of those people who will keep buying different brands until I am satisfied with the results. The brace does stretch a little after the first couple of uses but no big deal. This does not hinder the fit in any way. This brace has totally help eliminate the pain in my right knee. I still wear it on long or hilly runs for the added support. Hope this helps."
5,Wow!,"I have been suffering with severe knee pain for the last 4 months. I'm a fairly new runner and periodically have to take time off from running to ease the pain in my knee. Mostly, this pain occured after a run, to the extent that moving to and from a sitting position was impossible without support. Stairs weren't friendly either. So I did some research and decided to give this strap, based on the reviews, a try. Wow! I wish I had known about this sooner. Who knew a little $15 strap would solve my pain?? I'm back to running and feel no pain afterwards. I can even take the stairs at the gym back down to the lower level after using the treadmill with no discomfort. I'd recommend anyone with knee pain give this a try."
2,Good support but elastic stretches too much,"The main issue with this product was that because it uses elastic it stretches out as you play/run. I play basketball a couple times per week, and have had tendonitis issues for the last couple months. I find that this works well for a game or two, but that I constantly have to re-tighten it as I play. I don't know how it works for running, but would not recommend it for basketball or other sports that involve jumping. I ended up exchanging it and got an Ace knee wrap that doesn't use elastic and finds it gives me much more support as I run and cut."
2,Wouldn't stay put,"I think my leg may have been on the smaller side of what this contraption is made for because it just would not stay in place while I was running! I loved the straps small size and, for the first few minutes it would be of obvious help but it slid down my leg and required constant adjusting. I ended up returning it."
2,Compression too tight,I bought this as a preventative measure as I train for a half marathon. I've used other compression bands in the past and they were a good support without changing my stride. This band restrained my stride and actually caused my knee to hurt more than using nothing at all. I used it a couple times and now it retires in my closet permanently.
5,Lifesaver,"I was diagnosed w/tendonitis and hadn't been able to run for 3mos until I got this lil wonder....It supports my knee cap, I'm able to run! Great buy!"
4,Patella Strap,Strap has done exactly what it was bought for. Has helped the pain in the injured knee during athletic competitions.
4,Seems good so far,"I just put mine on. I felt instant relief on my patellar tendon. I've had pain for the last few years due to a patellarfemoral injury 4 years ago.My main comment is that the one I ordered (large) is slightly snug. I basically guessed what size because the amazon page for the product provides no sizing chart, nor does any other website. I find that to be pretty silly. But otherwise, seems like a good product so far."
2,Not that effective,I don't know that this brace is really doing much for me because there isn't much to it. I think it almost needs a top piece as well. I've gone back to leg weight exercises to strengthen my arthritic knee with better results.
5,Young Bryn Terfel still available thoorugh Amazon,"This CD is one of the best Lieder CDs i know. Bryn Terfel's voice is very fresh and beautiful, and his range of expression quite amazing. The piano playing is equally fine and fully matches the singing. It is my favourite gift CD, instead of party flowers to friends who love singing."
4,Masterfully Sung,"Terfel displays an understanding of Schubert that transcends most of the mediocre attempts that have preceeded. I highly recommend this C.D., it is a fresh, albeit different, look at this well-known cycle."
3,Very good--as a brief introduction to Sinatra's TV work.,"Yes, I agree with the reviewer who writes that the quality of the sound and picture on this DVD could be better.However, to be fair, TV was still relatively unsophisticated at the time. The TV lights beam down bright on Sinatra and his guests--but their faces are clearly visible and you can hear what they are singing and saying without any problems.This DVD is a great introductory collection of Sinatra's work with many of his contemporaries: Ella Fitzgerald, Lena Horne, The Rat Pack, Bing Crosby, Louis Armstrong, and more. This might be a very good DVD for people who want to see if they like Sinatra's work or who want to give this as a gift to someone they want to introduce to Sinatra's talent.One other note: the packaging includes no notes or inserts! You just get the DVD. Yet I recommend this DVD--but for newcomers to Sinatra or those of us who want to sample TV variety shows on a budget."
4,Xena cd volume 4,I'm a huge fan of this show. I have all 3 prior cd's. I enjoyed this cd more than the 1st because it doesn't have all the funeral durges of volume one. I like the Indian music. Definitely a cd of last season's (music) trip through India. If you're into it I suggest buying it here. I wish I did because I payed way too much elsewhere. It would've been even better if they would've added the theme song to this volume for the heck of it. In my opinion at Amazon's price it's a good buy.
3,Not as good a soundtrack for Xena as stand alone music cd...,By now there are four volymes of soundtrack music to the series Xena. This cd is maybe not the best to represent it BUT it do have a quality different from the e.g the first one: It is not directly Xena specific. In fact it kind of reminds me of 'Dead can dance' now and again. Good background music if you're reading. If you want soundtrack - buy the first cd! If you are a Xenite...then wait no longer - buy it too..along with everything else connected to the brand 'Xena'. :)
5,absolutely spectacular,"In the fourth installment of the XWP soundtrack, Joe LoDoca has really done it. Having a taste for world music, he has taken it here to the max. We get to travel from Chin, to Sibiria to India, all in one hour. This CD covers XWP's season four and a small portion of season three. The music which represents the setting for the episodes is influenced by various traditions, from east Asia to what I believe native American culture (in the northern Amazons' tracks). All arranged under the brriliance of this composer. When I first heard this CD, I was speechless, it just sounded perfect to me. This CD is recomended to anyone who is spiritualy oriented. Well done, Mr LoDuca!"
4,"If you've read this far, you might as well buy it.","If you bought the first and second soundtracks, you might as well buy this one too. Joe Lo Duca's composing just gets better and better. It's hard to imagine that this soundtrack is for a television show. Much of the success of Xena can be attributed to him...and the coolness that is Joxer."
1,Happy Jack,"Dudley Moore as ever a master at the piano.The cd is a must for anyone loving jazz that Dudley plays, his death was the greatest loss to jazz music you will ever remember."
5,Angel Symphony of Love and Light -Merlin's Magic,I love this CD. Listening to this music really helps me to relax. I listen to this CD when I practice tai chi and Nhu I which is a soft style kata in the style of Cuong Nhu.
5,Excellent reading,My wife can't stop raving about this book. It has helped us both in so many way. I would recommend this book to anyone dealing with this issue. God Bless.
1,looking for answers.,This book is not what i expected at all it was more religiousthen i expected.Its for people that are searching for answers through god.I thought it was more of infertility infomation.
1,more than disappointing,"i was looking for information on infertility, not christianity and god. misleading and deceptive, this book is hardly helpful or inspirational for the infertile. you want inspiration and information on getting through your infertility? take a look at the infertility survival handbook which has a great combination of the two without mentioning religion in overt terms."
1,Disappointing,"I could barely get through the first few chapters. The book is more of a religious book than a book on infertility. There are prayers and scripture throughout the book designed to open your eyes to God and trust Him in your quest for a baby. Although I was raised Catholic, I find this book to be highly annoying. I found the author to be completely over the top. She was obsessed with becoming pregnant and now she is trying to force her religious enlightenment on her readers."
1,Not What I Expected,"I'm sure this book is very powerful and helpful for some. However, be aware that this book does not provide any medical information but instead discusses the author's feelings and frustrations and how her faith in God helped her through infertility. The book is heavily religious. The few reviews I read did not provide this information, and I expected something different."
1,HOLY OVERKILL BIBLE THUMPERS!,"OK. I tried to be flexible getting into this book, but I don't know about the whole preaching part of it. What a waste of money. Glad I got mine used. I plan to sell mine."
5,The best,"All you losers who sayed this game sucks your wrong.You just dont know how to play it.The best part is making your own charecter and make him the best.It has alot of detail in Dynasty Mode with the player retiring and the draft picks and trades.And the retiring jerseys.This game is the best NBA LIVE game yet.PEACE,King JV"
4,Hope It's Better this year,"Im not all that excited about this game because it seems like its going to be just like last years NBA live 2003. Only thing thats going to be different is that they will have the new jerseys for the Nuggets, Cavs, Magic, & the Rockets and they would have Lebron James and Carmelo Anthony. It would be SUPER kool if they had a deep franchise mode just like Madden 2004. It would be one of the hottest games for the fall season."
2,Average Basketball Sim but NO 3-Point Shootout!,"EA generally does a good job with sports titles. NBA Live 2004 is a bit of a regression for the company. The game is servicable, the graphics OK and the gameplay average. But, coming from such a highly regarded video game maker this game should have been much better. For instance, the menu and navigation are confusing to say the least. Trying the Dynasty mode's fantasy draft it took me awhile to learn how to order my picks and positions. The absence of a 3-point shootout really takes away from this title for me. What EA did include was a practice mode which I couldn't care less about. Bottom Line, EA Sports NBA Live 2004 is not worth the money but maybe a rental. Hopefully '05 will be better. Not Recommended."
2,Bad,This game is very bad. I went and bought it and was surprised by how bad the controls. That is what probably makes this game not very fun to play.
5,more latin club mix 2000,"this cd is the best cd i heard in a long time, all the mixes are solid and have a really good beat and very danceable and good to listen to...im really into latin beats and rap music of coarse this being my generation and this cd has the kind of music i like; it has the latin beat with rap and i totally reccomend gettin this cd..you'll love it and your frenz will too."
1,not the real one,this is not the real soul makossa. stll waiting for the atlantic records one from 1972. will it ever be put on c-d. here is the tracks from the album. a 1 new bell.a 2 nights in zeralda.a 3 hibiscus.b 4 dangwa. b 5 lily. b 6 soul makossa.b 7 oboso. i live in new york city and i remember buying it at tower records on west 4th street. i was so happy to see it on c-d that i forgot to check the songs on it. man was i upset when i got it home and find out it was not like the album and tape that i have.do not be fooled.
5,Phantabluous Word guide book,"If you're like me and just learned what QWERTY means, then this guide is for you!! Microsoft's Word is quickly becoming a force in the world of word processing and you'd better jump that train before it leaves the station. I know how confusing it can be in the fickle computer industry but this guide makes sense of it all. With its 6""x6"" glossy photos and comforting prose, there's no need to fret. Michael Seringhaus' entire line of guides, from Adobe's Photoshop to Napster, are nothing short of a godsend. Get your copy today!!..."
2,The Thrill is Gone,The long runs in SSX3 are interesting and challenging but the sense of speed and pure fun of SSX Tricky are missing. Too many screens are so dark you can't see where you're going. The annoying interface forces you to endure tedious run-ups to the starting gate. 3 is for couch-spuds who want to put in long hours figuring out the short-cuts and hidden features. Tricky is the superior choice for players who want to have fun.
2,Not My Type of Game,"Picked this game up as part of a promotion. Can see how it would be fun, but it just isn't my type of game."
1,Not so good of a game :-(,This game was NOT what I expected it to be. I was thinking that it was going to be sooooo much better than SSX Tricky... but it wasn't. I am very dissapointed. The levels are VERY small and not that much fun. The riders aren't as funny or cool as the ones on Tricky. The layout of everything is better on tricky also. The players in SSX 3 dont start out with good stats like they do in tricky. This game is not worth it. If you are looking for a good and fun snowboarding game that will get you hooked FOREVER then get SSX Tricky. Dont waste your money on this game!
2,waste of time on xbox,"Now this is a good game, but its a complete waste of money if you have Xbox or Gamecube. On Xbox you could buy Amped 2 and on Gamecube you cn buy 1080 Avalanche. Buyit on PS2, not Xbox or Gamecube."
1,Not good,This game was NOT what I expected it to be. I was thinking that it was going to be sooooo much better than SSX Tricky... but it wasn't. I am very dissapointed. The levels are VERY small and not that much fun. The riders aren't as funny or cool as the ones on Tricky. The layout of everything is better on tricky also. The players in SSX 3 dont start out with good stats like they do in tricky. This game is not worth it. If you are looking for a good and fun snowboarding game that will get you hooked FOREVER then get SSX Tricky. Dont waste your money on this game!
5,An even more Tricky sequil,"This game is even better than SSX Tricky. The Mountain Design is great, there are even more insane tricks, and there is an awsome music sound track. The only problems of this game are only two players can play, and only the PS2 supports online play."
3,good game,"Unreal graphics, can do neat stunts. It's cool to be able to buy stuff from the store and wear it. Our kids love the game. I've played it a number of times also. It is a lot of fun however the music gets a little annoying and sometimes screen gets a little busy with all the rails, jumps, etc. Don't like the fact that you can knock down other riders when close to them. Also, some of the outfits for the girl riders are too revealing. Navigating to the different runs and lodge is difficult also."
5,Amazing story telling,"Although must of this book is planting seeds for stories to come later in the series, as usual Stan Sakai does an amazing job at telling the stories that you read here, making it incredibly interesting and absorbing. It can be a great jumping in point, since from this point on there are a lot of stories that will grow, however, and unfortunately with the Usagi Yojimbo books, I would recommend starting at the beginning, since it seems as a complete journey of the samurai, where we reencounter characters as one would if one was traveling in the same area for years. incredible storytelling and amazing art make this book a great read!"
3,Great alum gift,Very warm and cozy. The sole wears out too soon. Our UW extended family looks forward to this Christmas gift.
4,Great Mexican Homes,"Mexico its a country of extremes and contrasts, you could find some of the richest man in the world but also the poorest, some of the best things Mexico has to offer is its food, climate, culture and friendly and humble people, and last but no least great architects and amazing homes, please see for your self what this heaven homes from the mexican aristocracy!!"
3,Buy if you don't use docking or care for looks too much,"Pros :SturdyInside lining that prevents the case from hard-contact with iPodSeems to have some ability to absorb shock if droppedTracking control (or whatever it is called) to scroll through songs becomes less sensitve.Cons :Below average looks. Tosses the cool look of iPod into trash can.Difficult to take out and put it back. If you have a docking station that you use to play your songs in speakers, this case is a big NO-NO.Front silicon glass-like cover is not great quality but high ipod resolution and its bright screen kind of mask that.If you go for looks, no. If you look for a truck tier that guards your iPod, go for it. As for me, I am not too happy. I will continue to look around."
4,Great Protection for IPOD,This Iskin totally protects the Ipod from scratches and the navigation wheel responds without any problems. I wish the clear cover didn't scratch so easily and the lock button had a coutout to enable the lock button to function better.
2,Doesn't fit new 80 gig very well,"Like the heading says, this case barely fits on my new Gen 80 gig iPods, bulging at the seams and not totally covering the unit. I don't know what iPod this does fit well, but on mine, after literally hours of fiddling, it still is misshapen and awful. Nice clear cover over the screen, shame about the fit."
4,One Of Johnny's Best Live Sets!,"With alot of live recordings, the listener deals with terribly recorded music. The band might be on, but the person doing the recording is not. No bass, no drums, tinny guitar etc... With Johnny Thunders it's just the opposite. There are dozens of soundboard quality recordings available, but very few where Johnny is lucid enough to give a quality performance. This album, recorded at the Roxy in 1987, is rarity in that the sound quality and Johnny are both firing on all cylinders. The band features 2 of Thunder's former New York Dolls bandmates; the late Jerry Nolan (arguably punk rocks greatest drummer)and Arthru ""Killer"" Kane on bass. Any rock fan needs one Johnny Thunders live album in their collection and this one will do just fine.But let me warn you, once you hear Johnny...there's no going back.Rock on & R.I.P>"
3,Doped punk,"Has a few moments that are great, but the moments where he's slurred by dope give the understanding why he's not discussed in the same breath as Clapton, Hendrix, etc. Great choice if you're a fan, as I am."
2,Pretty Weak and Silly,"Lots of interesting ideas but an extremely weak plot. Barely worth reading for the ideas. Supposedly happens a billion years in the future, but the changes are weakly justified and, except for the scale of the Earth's having been moved closer to the center of the galaxy, could have taken place in a few thousand years from now. The climax is rushed and silly - Life as super-duper all-powerful force."
1,It just didn't connect with my mind's eye,"I'm a big SF fan, and it takes a lot for me not to like a book. But this was a truly painful read. With the story set in the far future, Benford's challenge was to convey aspects of the universe that lie well beyond our conceptual horizon, such as multiple dimensions, creatures based on magnetic fields rather than molecules, and the ""galactic mind"". In my opinion, he fails miserably; his prose is simply not literary enough to handle such difficult-to-put-into-words concepts. Nothing about the descriptions ""sing"". No grab-you-and-hold-you plot swings.In the Afterward, Benford writes that he might do a sequel. Hopefully it will be cowritten by a ""wow-can-that-guy-write!"" type author like William Gibson. At the very least, Benford needs a much more aggressive ""you-can't-write-that...it-just-doesn't-make-sense!"" editor. A lot of the shortcomings of this book might have been headed off by such.All in all, a real glad-I'm-finally-done-with-that-book! experience."
4,gregory benford,"folks if you like the hard stuff then benford is for you, with an imaginative mixture of theoretical physics and creative fiction, his books bound with possibilitys."
2,Round and round with no direction,"This book, like many Benford offerings seems to mistake confusion for art. The story line is weak and development is weak. Benford is, I'm sure a brilliant physicist, and my recommendation is that he stay with his day job."
5,Dolls R Supposed to be FUN!,"Ok... the review about girls staying home and making babies is actually SCARY! That screams a 3rd world mentality right there... Hello, it's the 21st century! AND it's a DOLL! Dolls are made for entertainment. Let's try not to read too much into toys people. It takes the fun out of everything.I haven't bought this one yet, but I plan on to. I used to read Archie comics when I was younger and this let's me relive my childhood. I personally think Veronica... and Betty... are beautiful. I just remember Veronica's hair being a bit wavier and her outfits more diva-ish... she is a spoiled rich brat afterall. Haha... Other than that she seems to be on point. They need to make an Archie so the love triangle will be complete."
5,SHE'S VERY PRETTY,I THINK THE HAIR MAY BE A BIT OVER DONE BUT EVERYTHING ELSE IS RIGHT ON. I LIKE THE MAKE-UP AND THE CLOTHES AND SHE DOES SEEM TO RESEMEBLE VERONICA FROM THE ARCHIE COMICS I REMEMBER READING AS A CHILD. I GIVE HER 4 & THREE-QUARTER STARS. (IT WOULD BE FIVE IF THE HAIR WERE BETTER.) SHE'S STILL A GREAT DOLL THOUGH. NEARLY PERFECT!!!!!!
1,Very satisfied with this seller's customer service,"I had a problem with the Veronica doll sold by MEGA Toyland (ASIN: B00081FP3I) but the seller addressed my concerns immediately and much to my satisfaction. I have deleted my original comment, but can't revise my star rating--would if I could."
4,It left a huge impression on me.,I heard this group while studying in France during the spring and was amazed that no one here in America had ever heard of them. They turn classic songs into a pumping beat that make you want to dance. That takes real talent.
4,I grew up on this stuff.,"Hey, it is kinda cool after having parents that would play the originals of all these fun songs when I was kid. Now it is nice to get back to that feeling of being a kid again with the songs being redone."
2,"Few thrillers, many fillers","I brought this CD about 2 years ago. I don't know what possessed me. I think it was the inane catchiness of Doodah. I hoped the rest of the album would be as fun and stupid as this. What I got was a few basic doof doof tracks and lots of fillers, including track 10, which was a tragic attempt at a ballad. The idea of the album (which is done by real musicians- how could they??!!) is a 60's style ""techno-billy"" sound. Standout tracks include Aisy Waisy and Witch Doctor and a cover of the Police hit Doo-do-do-de-da-da-da (because they pinched it from the Police). The rest is pretty mediocre"
1,Coaster,"""Witch Doctor"" is absolutely the WORST single I have ever heard. Every time this came on the radio, it made me want to spew.Absolutely worthless."
3,Fun read,"Good information and a fun read. Worth buying if you can't find it in the library, but if you have other end-time prophecy books, don't worry about this one."
5,A Great Little Puzzle,My four year old granddaughter is a puzzle whizz. I got this for her family as a Christmas Eve gift and she has done it several times since by herself. Sunout makes a nice durable puzzle.
3,Not much smell to it at all...........,"A faint smell; a nice cleaner - overpriced as the dickens. I thought I'd at least get a fragrant cleaner and was willing to pay the extra money for that, but it's so weak it doesn't do anything for the 'aroma' I'd hoped for since no one likes cleaning with those toxic-smelling cleansers, which is partly what I went this direction.I'll just make my own home-made non-toxic cleaners from now on and if I want a nice smell, I put that in myself for a lot less money and get what I'd hoped for with this.Still for people who don't have the time to make their own cleaners, I suppose it's a good alternative.I've used their home spray and candles; such a wonderful scent so I figured the cleaner would be the same, but not............:-("
1,FAUX GREEN - NOT NON TOXIC - SHADY COMPANY,This company fails to comply with disclosure of toxic ingredients and merely pretends to be green.
5,Love Mrs. Meyer's,"I have used Mrs Meyers products for at least three years. I am a housekeeper and all my clients love it and buy it for them selves. I use it a spray bottle for counters cabinets, Floors you name it you can use it. I have also had very good luck using it on carpets to remove stains. Like I said I love it and My clients do to this how I get so many referals by using Mrs Meyer's"
5,Love this stuff!,For some reason I have been stocking up on cleaning supplies and this one is my absolute favorite. It smells wonderful and a little bit goes a very long way. I filled up spray bottles with 1/4 cup cleaner and water and put them in every room of the house. They clean exceptionally well and I can let my daughter help me clean now that I don't have to worry as much about the chemicals.
4,Mrs Meyers all purpose lemon verbena cleaner,I love this product. I love the Lemon Verbena smell. I love that it is earth friendly since I have 2 children. I water it down 1/2 and 1/2. It can leave a film on some surfaces but I usually just wipe back over with clean dry rag. I buy this product all the time and I have given it as gifts for holidays to friends and family and they use it now.
5,Cleans and smells great!,"My husband and I recently spent the weekend at a lovely bed and breakfast in Vermont. Every time we entered the room, I just couldn't help but think how wonderful it smelled. I decided to try the lavender all purpose cleaner myself and am delighted with how well it cleans. I now have a great smelling home that reminds me of our get away! Just love this product!"
4,Very good product!,"Love the ingredients. Really like the packaging, price point and scent. My cleaning person alternates between this and the purple fabuloso cleansers mixed 1:1 with water. She swears that both are as effective as clorox or the other all purpose cleansers marketed. She also said that these go much further so they are more cost effective! She does prefer the scent of this one but said the Fabuloso is a bit more effective."
5,best all purpose cleaner ever,"I use this product for my cleaning compamy and my customers loved, I really recommend this product to everyone, the value is great and they delevery less than one week."
3,An OK Hard Case,It protected our Coleman Two-Mantle Dual Fuel Powerhouse Lantern (295) on our recent trip. The material is sturdy enough although I don't think it will last long exposed to the elements. I like that the lantern clicks/locks into the base to keep it steady. There is also room between the lantern and base to store extra mantles or small parts (matches?)The one thing I really hate are the locking tabs/slots on the lower side. It worked fine although I had to focus on what I was doing to lock it. It also seemed that it would only go on one way as if the tabs were offset.
5,Now a Collide fan,"I sampled some of the songs on this cd on amazon. They sounded good so i ordered the cd. I'm new to Collide's music but now I am a fan. This is a 2 disc cd. It has great remixes which range in sound from rock, techno, to remixes that put my in mind of Enya. The lead voice is beautiful. I'm very pleased with this cd and will be looking into other Collide albums."
5,Amazingly Brilliant!!!,"Collide must be one of the greatest bands ever to hit the gothic scene. The combination of Karin and Statik are explosive; indeed, Vortex is definitely their masterpiece of Remixes done right! As well as new songs that will demand your attention, highly note worthy!! Some of the best out there!Listen to the samples on this site just so you can say ""Yeah, I'm a smart consumer."" If you like any combination of Collide, you're gonna end up buying Vortex, it is most certainly a treat for the ears and the imagination."
5,stevie and albert,"Excellent Buy....Highly recommend if you like stevie ray vaughan and the blues of albert king. The DVD on my surround sound system was all I needed, but the CD in the car is an added bonus."
5,In Sesion(Deluxe Edition CD/DVD,"Must have for any SRV, or Albert King library ! When the master is awestruck with the student you know you have something special !"
5,cd blues,My husband and I both love the Blues and this CD is the most wonderful cd I have listen to.I would recommend this cd to anyone who likes the blues.
4,no talk just music please,"Great music but the talking breaks the spell. Tracks 2,5,7,10 should have been omitted from this album because they are just talk. Four stars because of talking."
4,Blistering blues!,"Some of the finest blues guitar you'll ever see or hear. And some of Albert King's absolute best stuff. Highly recommended for fans of Stevie Ray and Albert - or anybody who even pretends they're into electric blues. I like the song selection on the DVD even better than the CD - and all of the banter is truly inspired, as well. Albert is old school and he intends to teach the ""new kid"" who's in charge. Stevie Ray is a thrilled and thrilling student. There have been a lot of duets lately that have been forced or just plain strange. In this session - the two bring out the absolute best in the other. Also - should mention the back-up band - who are nothing less than first rate with an almost telepathic feel for what both guitarists lay down. Breathtaking - invigorating - the best blues album of at least a decade."
5,SRV Rocks,"I've had the raw footage of this show for years, but it was great to finally get a commercial release.The chemistry between SRV and AK is great. It's fun to watch these guitar giants trading licks and chatting about the blues. Highly recommended!VinceSRVrocks.com"
4,Great Blues; Audiophiles win-win,Just great considering the sittin' and pickin' style of production that is. Surround freak that I am I would have been happy with a good surround mix; granted that it would be deemed a waste by most. Six years and still in print; maybe SACD will make it. All the industry says that this or DVD-Audio is a waste of time and money...doesn't any of them see what we're paying for out of print stuff? I won't even begin on the stuff I may never be able to replace. Great SACD.
5,Albert King and Stevie Ray Vaughn,I bought this for my brother for Christmas who is a guitar player and he loves it!!! Would highly recommend for anyone who appreciates great guitar!
5,Awesome CD and DVD. Love it.,This is an awesome CD/DVD combo. I love SRV and this is a great addition to my collections of SRV Music.
5,incredible,"One of my absolute favorites....recommend to anyone who love the blues. I gave away my last one, then realized I couldn't do with out it. So I ordered a new one. Cant go wrong with this Cd/Dvd"
2,made light out of some people's genuine pain,"Although I agree with the premise that stress can and does cause physical pain and many chronic ailments, there are many of us out there with serious debilitating back problems, that can not be just ""willed away"" or minimized by meditation and breathing exercises. A small chapter at the end of the book owned up to some of the serious back problems that are, in fact, serious and would need special treatment sometimes (rarely) even surgery. I have a feeling this was inserted as almost an afterthought to prevent any lawsuits from anyone believing you can ignore your serious back problems and get right back to your previous normal life. Unfortunately that's not the case for many people out there who aren't just suffering from muscle spasms and stress."
1,Back Sense: A Revolutionary Approach to Halting the Cycle of Chronic Back Pain,"While the primary concept of stress and muscle tension being the underlying cause of almost ALL chronic back pain may sound sensible to some, those who suffer from chronic back pain may beg to differ.This book may be helpful to those who have an occasional muscular back ache, I don't think it's an effective solution to people with an injury based long term back condition."
2,Overrated,The entire book suggests that your back pain is caused by stress. That's it. No suggested treatment. Now you need to buy a different book on how to de-stress.
1,Hogwash Book reads like a Workers Comp manual on denying Benefits to hurt people,THe book tries to say back injuries are stress. I dont think herniated discs or annular tears heal in a couple of weeks. A Social Security Doctor just recommended me to read this. Even though my injures were hernaitons with annual tears. So even though he was aware of my injuries he still must think its stress related . WHAT A JOKE. BOOK STINKS
3,It's already been done,"This theory had already been proposed at least 10 years earlier by Dr. John Sarno in Healing Back PainHealing Back Pain: The Mind-Body Connectionand later expanded upon in The Mindbody PrescriptionThe Mindbody Prescription: Healing the Body, Healing the Pain."
3,Product Image is Wrong,"Product image shows the ""Daily Revitalizer"" that I was hoping to purchase. However, I received the Stone Tile Cleaner as advertised. Obviously my fault since I received what I ordered. If you are looking for the Daily Revitliizer, I suggest going to usastonecare.comI have used the Stone Tile Cleaner, it is a good product."
5,COME ON ITS FRANK!!!!,THE BEST FROM THE BEST AND THE EXTRA DISC ON WARRIOR YOGA IS AWESOME THIS PROGRAM SHOULD ADD ALOT OF EXTRA REVENUE TO ANYONE WHO TEACHES IT.
1,Problems,The CD#2 is wrong. There is a manufacturing defect. CD#2 is the same than CD#1. Should be replaced. I live abroad.How can be solved?
2,The start of Atari's downfall,"Atari fans had big hopes when Atari scored the home console rights for Pac-Man. Pac-Man debuted on the Atari 2600 in late 1981. Sales were very strong, but fans were disappointed in the overall product with its VERY poor graphics, constantly flickering ghosts, the ""wonk"" sound Pac-Man made when he ate a ""video wafer"", the bleeps and bloops when Paccy ate a ghost/power pellet/special treat, the weird layout of the maze, and the notorious and infamous Pac-Man ""death scene"" sound effect. Atari proved that the 2600 could have a good Pac-Man game the next year with Ms. Pac-Man, but Pac-Man on the Atari 2600 was the beginning of the end of Atari's reign as the Video Game Kings."
2,Not a good game but would make a nice drink coaster,"What Law said in his review pretty much sums up this game so I dont feel I need to add much. What Atari was making when concieved to market this pile of junk for a game I don't know. Yes as Law said there is terrible sound effects with the ""Wonk"" sound, terrible graphics and poor control execution, also the same map repeats itself over and over again. This game should be picked up by the U.S. intelligence agencies and used to torture people during interrogation. If you see this game say a prayer and walk away quickly because it is certainly from the Devil. The only reason I gave this game two stars was because there is some skill too it as the ghosts get faster and harder to escape, but that is being generous."
1,Dud,This seller did not leave accurate information. The game did not work. We ended up having to buy another PacMan from a different seller. You suck!
4,"It's not bad, but Ms. Pac-Man and Jr. Pac-Man is way better","This game had a rushed development and overproduction causing it to be a finanical failure despite selling 7 million copies making it the best selling video game ever for Atari 2600.What turned people off about this game was the graphics. The graphics looked nothing like the arcade version and are among the worst for an Atari 2600 game, even for the consoles limitations. This game is still playable and fun, but I'd recommend buying Ms. Pac-Man or Jr. Pac-Man over this, but it's still not bad. A big compliant is that the layout never changes after each level and the ghosts flicker a lot but it isn't a huge problem."
3,"Its good, but not a ""MUST HAVE"" .","Hello! Now lets see the graphics :Well some people say they su**ks. But im not gonna blame because they could only do SO much on a early 8 bit system.controles: Now ive found it hard soetimes to controle pac man (which makes it hard to play). But just make sure you press the joystick all the way.gameplay (set up): well Atari made this pretty good. Its hard to control pac man,ghosts are flickering but it does't mind me.I have 5 copies so I might sell one here."
4,The original and first pac man.,This is the first pac man on the atari 2600 and it became the most famous game ever. It is on almost every arcade machine and the joystick is a help to beat the game. The porpose of the game is to beat each maze by eating all of the pebbles without getting eaten by the ghosts. Each maze gets harder and harder and the ghosts get faster. This is a great game but it is hard and does not fit on most new tv's because it was made in 1983.
4,12 year old bionicle fan.,"I got this game for chrismas and I was very exited about playing it.I switched it on and the first thing I noticed was that the that the toa and the villagers look really different than they do in the movie and the toy.I beat the game in 5 1/2 hours.They make tou be toa Tahu in the start then Kopaka,and just from there you get the toa nuva,then you use Gali and fight all 6 bohrok kal with no help.Then Pohatu kills lerahk with no hand to hand fighting same thing when you use Lewa exept you're fighting Panrahk.Then you surf with Tahu and you have to get to Ta-koro before Kurrahk then the game kills Kurrahk you get the mask of light it puts itself on Takua and then you fight Makuta.Makutas way to easy for a bionicle as powerful as him.The game was fun and it was cool to use the toa but there is alot of things they could have done but they didnt.It certainly needs better graphics and more realistic characters."
3,good but short,This could be more fun if it wasn't so short. The game also freezes a couple times on my 360. Also the game doesn't have much story and some parts have no explanation as to what's going on.
1,dissapointment,"THis game has poor graphics, little gameplay, boring content, and does not deliver what has been expected. I had wanted a game that had all six toa in both forms but you never even see half the toas except in the movies, by the way the ones youv'e seen online, they're not on the game. I was able to beat this game in 4 hours. There were so many oportunites to make this game so much better but instead they went for the quick finish. i am extremely dissapointed in this game. i"
4,Very objective,"In my humble opinion, the most valuable thing about this book is that the author has a neutral point of view with little bias, which is probably not very easy for those live only through the morden capitalism society. It is hard to do justice to the forms of different societies, from the advanced westen capitalism countries to the transformed easten european countries to the still alleged-communism countries, without looking back into the history. The author, standing on the historical point of view, argued vividly on the pattern of the dramatic evolution of the short century. It seems to me that the first part and second part of the book are more clearly argued than the third part, probably simply because the third part of the history is not far enough for us to have a panorama view. But overall, the book is very enjoyable to read."
5,Great!!!,"This is a masterpiece, a modern classic. What more can you say about a book like this? After I read this one I was convinced: Professor Hobsbawn IS the best historian alive."
2,Well written anachronistic thinking,"Hobsbawm's Age of Extremes presents a marxist view on world history while marxism has proved to the world that it just cannot work. In that sense, it is a pity that prof. Hobsbawm, who is admittedly a prolific writer, invalidates any thesis he would have liked to present in this book by using marxist philosophy in writing history. By focusing on Russia as being the determining force of 20th century history, he presents a distorted view of what were the central issues in international relations in the 20th century, of which Russia was only one of several. Hobsbawm should read Hayek and then rewrite this book. For sure it would be better then and certainly more accurate."
2,I won't become a communist,I may not be an expert as I'm only 15 years old but here goes what I think about this book. It's Hobsbawm's view of History and it's strongly influenced by the remains of Hobsbawm's commitment to the communism I think this may have twisted his vision. This is very bad because so many people read the book and sometimes when you don't have enough knowledge you are influenced by the author's thoughts and his vision becomes your vision.
2,Not up to the standards of the other three,"Hobsbawm steps outside his area of expertise here (the 19th Century) and it shows. The relative lack of footnotes and references (compared to the earlier three books in the series) attests to that. Also, although this isn't the same scholarly work as the first three books, the writing style is just as recondite -- there are better, easier ways to get at the history of the 20th Century!His account of the role of the Soviet Union merits reading, if only because Hobsbawm is a Marxist, and so he has a lot of sympathy for the Soviets. With the Cold War over and the USSR dead, it's actually quite interesting to read viewpoints from the other side."
1,Marxist Propaganda,"This book is written by an avowed Marxist, and as such, neglects to mention the horrors of Soviet Russia. Not only that, Ol' Eric discusses how horrible capitalism is, even though it was only because of capitalism that he was able to publish this waste of paper. He does not spend much time at all on World War II, and has the gall to called Richard Nixon a horrible president (which he was) without heaping abuse upon Stalin or any other Communists. The book also glosses over most historical events and goes for the ""Big Picture"" of history. I hated this book. Until I read it, I actually enjoyed learning about history. Now I am not so sure."
2,"Truth in advertising, please","There is no question that Hobsbawn, who recently passed away, was a prolific historian and a gifted writer, but it seems less than candid for any review of his work, especially this one, not to mention that he was a Stalinist to the end of his days. He justifies the mass murder of tens of millions as the necessary eggs that must be broken to make the omelette of Soviet industrialization, even though every other industrial power managed to do better without the bloodshed. He justifies the Nazi-Soviet Pact and the invasion of Hungary. As little less gushing and little more candor would be in order."
2,A Task Light not capable of most tasks...,"This light is just ""ok"". This light is fairly bright, given how small it is, but its not a light for ALL tasks. The light would probably be fine for reading at night but not suitable if you are, oh lets say, working on a car or something where you really need a bright light.My biggest gripe is probably how uncomfortable the light actually is on someone's ear. It is not ergonomic by any means of the imagination. It seems like its not really built to fit on the ear at all. When you place the light over your ear it actually makes the light swivel practically into your eye ball, which is exactly where you don't want it. I would only recommend this light to people who plan on using it to read for short periods of time."
2,I-Sight Less Useful than Hoped,"I often work late in a office that uses timed motion sensing after 5PM, so I thought that rather than jump up like a wild man every 15 minutes to turn the light back on I'd instead put a small flashlight over my ear. In practice this doesn't work as well as I had hoped. The spot illuminated by this light is small enough to make it annoying to keep it on the subject of interest. The quality of the light is very blue, causing eyestrain if used for long periods. And the earpiece is somewhat uncomfortable and hard to adjust. On the plus side, the light is very handy for working under the desk when cables need to be moved, because it frees both hands and provides plenty of light to locate and orient plugs and such. And it's very handy to have a small flashlight in a dark office even if you don't hang it over your ear. I found it a worthwhile purchase even if it didn't turn out to be as useful as I had hoped."
2,Not a reading light,"There are some serious flaws with this unit. The most serious is that with the batteries inserted, the slightest bump - which means something as simple as tossing it into a laptop bag - activates the on-button and turns the light on. So there it is, draining away the cell batteries as it sits inside your bag.Second, it doesn't really fit comfortably on the ear if you wear glasses. It's awkward and falls off easily.Third, there is no way this has sufficient illumination to read with, due to the limited ability to direct the light where you want it to go, especially wearing glasses.UPDATE: I subsequently purchased the Kandle LED Book Light from amazon for my Kindle 1, and it works MUCH better. Far superior to this product!"
2,Not the best.,"If I hadn't distroyed the package, I would send it back. I wanted to use this to crochet at night, its a task light isn't it. Unfortunately, I can't adjust the light and direct it at my task. To aim the light at my task I have to move the entire light, and then it will not stay on my ear. It is good however to use in the dark if your lights go out. It is bright."
4,It works great!,"I work backstage and need to be hands-free when dressing actors. This is a focused light and works quite well. Only drawback is that the batteries don't last more and 1 or 1-1/2 weeks (8 shows a week), other than that it's just fine."
2,It provides light.,"Maybe it's just my ears, but this light rattles around with the slightest move. The area lit up is also very small, so it's uses are limited. I would not recommend this to anyone hoping to use it for reading."
5,finally,finally.....they come out with a James Bond game that is multi player and now i get to woop my friends .... thnk god they came to their senses to make this game.... this game is the best!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,"Sorry, Bond. Your games suck","Is it just me, or is that the 007 games have just been getting worse and worse since Goldeneye? In fact, with the latest addition to the Bond franchise, ""Everything or Nothing"", you could actually say that ""Everything"" about it is ""Nothing"". This game is just plain dumb. I thought when I just had herd about this game ""oh great! a third-person Bond game"". I was highly mistaken. This game has terrible gameplay, terrible controls, and terrible cutscenes. Bond fans, gamers or not, will be highly dissappointed with this game, because it has NOTHING compared to Agent Under Fire, and Goldeneye. This game's predecessor, Nightfire, sucked equilly as much, and if they make another Bond game after this, it will flop so badly that the entire franchise will go out the window. People tell me that it's ""my opinion"", but theyr're wrong. This is THE opinion. This game is a waste of time and money. DO NOT BUY IT!"
5,Simply Awesome,"i must say that this game was simply outstanding I love the storyline,the weapons,and the characters(including singer Mya & Nadia from Apple Pie). This game is similar to splinter cell as far as the smooth movement of the characters and diffcult of levels.Every level is very detail and layout perfectly. This definitely a must have for any 007 fan.Graphic - 10/10Sound - 10/10"
3,Bond's second finest hour,"I've only played the demo,but by the looks of it it's a good game.I've played 007 nightfire,now that was good."
1,Do not buy this game.,"Total dissapointment. Issues with freezing during gameplay and disk read errors cancel out any fun on the ice. Tech support was pathetic, and two days after buying went to EB games to trade in."
4,"Best hockey game bar none, but no XBox Live support","This game is the best hockey simulation on the market. There is a long learning curve, especially for ""advanced"" moves with or without the puck, but as one review says anything that's worth it is hard to learn. Once you learn the controls, it is awesome. Almost every setting in the game is adjustable, so don't get frustrated if you don't get it right away, just play with the settings. Dynasty mode is great, and so is the Stanley Cup celebration if you win it! There is no XBox Live support for this game, as with other EA titles, because EA and Microsoft refuse to play nice with each other in the online gaming market. Until they do, it's us the consumer that will end up getting screwed as usual. Get this game, but if there is no Live support in 2005 and forward, I for one will refuse to be a pawn in the MS EA power struggle."
5,Once A Marshal,"I was a little late in reading this one. Once Hell Freezes Over was the first Brandvold book I read, and that hooked me. This is a very good western and I highly recommend it. I personally liked Hell Freezes Over more, mainly because it focused on people held hostage in a small cabin during a snow storm - elements which I enjoy."
5,AMAZING CD. BUY IT NOW.,"Hope is an AMAZING artist. I've had her CD for quite a while now for promotional reasons only, but now that the CD is out in stores, it gives me such a rush. She is such an amazingly sweet person in real life, &totally awesome in concert. BUY THIS CD. You really wont regret it. She's awesome."
1,DON'T BUY COPY PROTECTED MUSIC!!!,ENCRYPTED MUSIC TAKES AWAY OUR RIGHTS AS AMERICAN CITIZENS. STAND UP FOR YOUR RIGHTS AND DON'T BUY THIS ARTISTS MUSIC!
5,Amazing,"Hope's cd is amazing. I totally recomend it!! ""who we are"" is such an amazing song, if youl like that song then you wont regret buying the cd."
4,"Maybe there is ""hope"" for the future of teenage pop music after all","If teenage girls aspiring to singing careers would try to pattern themselves after Ms. Partlow instead of Britney or Christina, teenage pop music might actually be headed someplace good for a change. Cute (literally), wholesome and full of innocence, she diligently brushes aside the stigma that affect many of today's popsters. Good singing, fresh-sounding instrumentation, no samples, and not the slightest hint of anything naughty make this an album that kids and parents should be able to agree on."
5,Hopeful,"Hope's CD is everything I anticipated! I love the style of music she does. It sorta reminds me of Brie Larson and Aly and AJ. I really enjoyed the cd! After listening to all the songs, I'd have to say my favorite song is ""I Believe in You"". Hope has an AMAZING voice!! This CD rocks my socks!!"
4,THERE IS HOPE!!!,"With such an elegant voice and a fresh face ,Hope Partlow is poised to become the next great young voice.Who We Are and Everywhere But Here are my favorite tunes .Plus she is only 16 and has many years of greatness ahead.Buy this one !!! Plus my two daughters love it also !!!"
5,I love this media player,"I got my Showcenter a month ago. We play a lot of our videos on it which we previously would have had to view on our PC.Our Showcenter is directly connected to our AP via an ethernet cable. The Showcenter server software runs on Windows and is quite good. It plays almost all of our videos, music and pictures. It isn't quite easy to put together playlists but otherwise the display is quite easy to use and flashy.I don't actually use the Windows software, preferring to keep all my files on a Linux server instead. There are three open source alternatives to the commercial software: Oxylbox, Open Showcenter and SwissCenter. Open Showcenter is my fav just because it is easier to configure. The other two have extra features so you can automatically get the weather, etc.All in all I recommend this, but if you aren't very computer literate you may have difficulties configuring it."
4,A Change of Pace,"I agree with what's already been said by the Amazon review. . . it's not the same as the previous two albums. To be honest, I was surprised that the second album lived up to the quality of the first Zero 7 album, because THAT one has to be the best chillout music ever made. (And believe me, that's saying a lot for me.)This new disc is decidedly more upbeat, which is a bit of a disappointment in itself. (I was looking for more stuff to take the stress out of my day.) But, I am always a fan of a band that is willing to take a chance and to grow, rather than stick to their standard formula. The music is good, even if not as expected. Roll the dice and give it a shot."
1,Disappointment,"When you fall in love with an artist you naturally want everything they've made. And even when they grow and try new things you open your mind to it, knowing that they've still got 'that sound'.... well Zero 7 has lost it. Too much experimenting and not enough focus. Album is all over the place and lacks stylistic cohesiveness. I bought the 'throw it all away' single that has a video and 2 b-sides as well. The only song that kind of works is that single. Otherwise, all other songs on album & b-sides are a folk mishmosh of odd sounding Carol King, Beatles and Mamas & Papas songs. I miss the soothing creamy vocals and how they were well proportioned to the innovative electronic music. If they stray any farther from the 'downtempo' style we all know and love, they will surely lose more fans."
2,hegmannreview,"This group's first 2 CDs were tranquil, soothing, smart, innovative and just darned interesting. In marked contrast we have Garden, their latest release. I have barely been able to listen to this 2 times, with plenty of skipping forward. This album, despite its name is full of harsh sounds, grating singing and some annoying song endings. I am saddened by this release, as we listen to their other CDs in our office regularly. Garden will be placed on the shelf, where it shall stay, save for moments of masochistic urges."
1,"awww, what a disappointment","i've loved zero 7 forever. their first two albums, are faaaantastic. this, however, was not. i don't like it b/c it's a bit different from their other two, i don't like it b/c i simply thing the songs are just overall too boring! i'm all about artists changing their style if they want, it's their music, but...i don't know, i could barely get through a couple listens of the entire album. i had to give up.(good thing they totally redeemed themselves big time, on 'yeah ghost'!)"
2,Very Little For Such Talent,"I was surprised when I purchased this album. Not as interesting as Ithought it would be. I found it boring. The only song I liked was""the Pageant of the bizarre""; it's truly Zero 7."
2,pales in comparison to earlier work,"The only song on ths album I find myself going back to is the instrumental ""Seeing Things,"" and that track isn't even representative of Zero 7. Simple Things is a far superior album with some excellent melodies and instrumentation. The Garden doesn't even come close. There isn't even a ""Warm Sound"" to redeem things like on the overall mediocre When It Falls. Avoid this one."
3,the kings of sub pop at it again,"This new Zero 7 album is a step in a different direction than their older work, though they still demonstrate that they have a firm grasp on the inner-workings of the sub-pop genre. This album features Sia and Jose Gonzales a lot - so it's more vocal and a little less electronic. But the vocal talent is well supported by the musical concepts of Sam and Henry. ""Throw it all Away"" and ""Crosses"" are the highlights of this album. I also highly recommend Gretchen Lieberum and her new album, ""Siren Songs,"" which is another great example of vocal sub pop. The thing about sub pop is that it's so easy to get wrong and lack energy - it's easy to form an amalgamation of sounds that don't have any meaning when they're put together. But this album shows that Zero 7 is still at the top of its game."
1,"Tepid, disappointing pile of poo - save your money","I have really enjoyed Zero 7's previous releases a lot and thought they were great in concert. I was looking forward to this release, but it is really a major disappointment. In deference to my respect for Zero 7's past releases, I've given this CD several listens, with the hopes that it would grow on me, but each listen merely reinforces my original opinion. This is not just a ""not good"" album; it is a BAD album. If I could give it zero stars, I would. With the exception of the first song, which is ok (in a relative sense), the rest of the CD is as bland as anything I've heard in a long time. The songs have no hooks, go nowhere and even good singing can't redeem bad songwriting. This is one of the most disappointing CDs I've ever purchased. I'm going to sell it to the used CD store pronto before too many reviews get published and there is no resale value for this steaming pile."
1,Deeply disappointing...,"I ran out and bought this cd the very day it came out. Then sat listening anxiously for something to stir inside of me. Alas, nothing. A few weeks later, still nothing. A month later, I tried again. I yawned... Then I got up and cleaned the kitchen finding that more interesting. When I first started listening to Zero 7, I was drawn, pulled, attached to their music. I got it, it got me--we connected. My friend Mel asked me the other day how this cd was and I let her listen to it; she yawned and said, ""I guess they've lost it"". Should they release another cd, I'd borrow it from the library first and then buy it only if I really love it. But this cd was deeply disappointing..."
1,Gone Commercial,"I used to be a fan, but the damn anti piracy front end software on When it Falls will not allow me to create a custom CD from my selected cuts. ANY musical group that bundles anti piracy software with their release will not get my hard earned dollar. The idiots at Zero7 have made a MAJOR marketing error."
1,Trash,"Heres a tip, see how much this goes for 2nd hand compared to the rest of there stuff...Then read this.1 good track (1st track) tries to sell an album.Download the 1st track and skip the rest, save your cash."
4,The Garden,"An interesting refreshingly new cd that is not in the mainstream of current popular music scene. Relaxing but exciting, pleasant melodies with great musical textures. I strongly recommend to anyone who has an enjoyment of fine music."
4,It needs a chance,"It seems there a lot of mixed feelings about this album. I think it is quite good, yes a departure from Simple Things, but different is not bad it is just different. I will admit at first I had mixed feelings about it, but after a few listens it really grew on me. I think it could be their best album yet. I do miss the vocals of Sophie Barker, but change is sometimes a good thing. It is nice to see a band move away from the more typical sounds of this genre. The acoustic guitars really add a nice touch. The most important ingredient is still here, the ethereal atmospheric sounds. If you keep an open mind and give it a chance you may really like it."
3,Doesn't approach early stuff (IMHO),"As a huge(!) fan of Simple Things and to a lesser extent When it Falls, I was excited to read other reviewers positive comments about The Garden. On first listen however, I felt that the duo had taken another step downward with this album. After repeated listenings I am definitely a bigger fan of this album than I was at first, but (sadly) I'm becoming more convinced that Simple Things was an accomplishment that these guys might never attain again. I hope I'm wrong and I'm still glad I purchased The Garden."
2,"Zero 7, what have you done?","The ethereal, dreamy, triptronic sounds that we fell in love with on Zero 7's first CD are a distant memory. I bought their latest CD with high hopes (never heard their sophomore effort), and was sorely disappointed. The opening tracks remind me of Steely Dan--ugh. And the rest is a mishmash of cheesy sounds and a much less sensual-sounding result. C'mon, Zero 7. It wasn't broken...why'd you have to fix it?"
2,Solidly boring,"2 1/2Although average, it is a consistent, high-brow mediocrity. The group continues to focus on production technique at the expense of creating memorable tunes, which initially brought them into the spotlight on their debut. Here, although consistently ""pleasant enough"" to suffice as background coffee shop fodder, barely anything sticks to memory and what does still comes up emotionally superficial."
1,Bury it in the Garden,"I gotta admit, this album really let me down. It doesnt have the touch that the others have. I was really looking forward to this and it didnt come thru for me. I wanted more of Sia and Tina and was really disapointed."
1,I agree totally with the 1 star guy....,"I WAS a big Zero 7 fan, but like many new artists of today they try to sway from their 'sound' too early in their career. What the hell is with this new album? What happened to their lazy Sunday, warm melodic sound that captured you? The vocals are just plain boring...none of the tracks really grab you. It sounds too detached and there's no 'soulfullness'The French band Air did the same thing with their latest album.WE WANT THE SOULFUL 70's INSPIRED CHILLOUT BACK. Not experimental masturbation test pressings.Yawn."
2,Not so impressed,"I love their first CD which is one of my all time favorites. but it seems like they stopped trying...the first song in this album is great, and just kind goes downhill from there."
5,The Garden,That cd is just touching and well made by Zero 7. Zero 7 is awsome and I am your fan also. Thank you for so much.
2,Wilted Garden,"The first track on this new album suggests that Sam Binns and co. are taking a cue from early 70s prog-rock/folk, much as OPETH did with their sublime, beautiful Damnation in 2005. However, the rest of the album retreats back to the soul/lounge styling of the first two albums, but with none of the gorgeous, swooning melodies they offered. The whimsical, kitschy instrumentals from Simple Things are gone as well, replaced by some flat, childish sing-songy pieces like 'Pageant of the Bizarre'. Even a mostly beautiful track like Throw It All Away is marred by an odd chorus. Very disappointing, especially given how great a find Simple Things was when it came out."
3,"3.5 stars, really","Very different from the other 2 albums. Not a lot of standouts. ""If I can't have you"" is my favorite song, I can't get it out of my head. Not sure that I like a lot of the vocals on the other songs. Still a good album in the chill genre. It works by having a singular vibe."
1,Disappointed,"The title should read, ""The Garden of Hell"". I loved the first album, the second effort was different but acceptable, but this is beyond description. I don't know what genre this would fall under, but alternative/fusion dance chillout or deep house is miles away from this effort.Binns and Hardaker should have stuck with the formula which had worked for them before. I expected a follow up to Waiting Line, Spinning, Destiny, but got nothing.I should have listened to the sample clips before buying this album, a practice I choose to avoid only for Zero 7. This effort is a major disappointment for me. I guess I'll stick to the first two Cd's and let this one gather DUST."
2,Elevator Music,"This is a boring album.The first song, Futures, is deceiving. It is a masterpiece of a song. It blew me away the first time I played it. The end of it is pure electronic bliss. I always turn up the volume here. The rest of the album is nothing like this song. It is largely lounge pop and accessible elevator music. It is not very engaging. It sounds like the well-produced work of a jam band that picked out ""best of"" selections in a long, groovy session. There are a couple of interesting sections and songs like ""If I Can't have You"", ""you're my flame"", and ""waiting to die"" are good songs. ""This Fine Social Scene"" is a close second to ""Futures"". It is very eerie and very good. Unfortunately, the connecting songs are filler. Maybe this band should stick to singles and wait longer between albums."
1,Where's the golf?,"Sorry Troon, but you put a snowman up on this one. What a big disappointment. I loved the other Eddie C. books... I always tried to read one as spring approached to get me in the golfing mood. But this ain't no golf book... and barely and Eddie C. book. I feel like I was duped. For others considering this as their next followup to The Green, The Foursome, and Scratch.... don't."
2,An Eddie Caminetti novel?,"While Barranca may be a ""good"" book, I was most disappointed with it. After reading The Green, The Foursome, and Scratch, I was willing to do just about anything to get my hands on another Eddie Caminetti novel. For all intents and purposes, this is not an Eddie Caminetti novel. Eddie plays almost a minor role in the story, and there's none of the depthy cleverness of the first three novels as it pertains to the world of golf. Troon McAllister (a.k.a. Lee Gruenfeld) missed the mark on this one."
1,Deep into the rough with no hope of redemption,"I have followed this series with passion. I have loved the three previous books. Each was cleaver, funny and deeply entertaining. For this book I had to struggle to keep reading it and had to put it down on several occassions. I have yet to finish the book! I have read about 80% of it and could not go further. Although some of the commentary about society and corporate sponsoring is amusing, the book was conspicuously lacking enough of Caminetti. I read the books because of HIM. If you want to write social commentary send an editorial to the newspaper or go on Larry King. I paid to read about Eddie and escape the issues of society. I hope that the next (if there is one) is stongly focused around eddie and his adventures. The earlier books were such good efforts that this was a HUGH disappointment."
4,A Different Take on Eddie,"I have mixed feelings about this one. The premise is great, and it starts out laugh out loud funny with a steady stream of the author's wry, tongue in cheek humor. About one-third of the way in, the cleverness slows down markedly and the story gets told. Finally, at the end, we get the real story that is almost preachy and serious.Don't get me wrong. I really liked this book, and I considered giving it a 5. The cynicism toward politics and the media are absolutely on target, but something about the changes of pace and the preachy tone took a bit of the edge off for me.The Green and Scratch are both better."
2,better luck next time,"could not wait to get my hands on this new mcallister book, the previous efforts being so entertaining & w/such superb character development. this one was all over the map as i guess even the best writers experience a ""hiccup"" now & again! certainly NOT worth the price of admission."
5,"Excellent, on all counts","I'm not enough of a critic to comment in detail, I just love to read and this book got to me in a big way, not the least of which was the number of my ""hot buttons"" that MacAllister was able to express a lot better than I could. It's a great story, filled with characters you hate to leave (even the bad guys), and just when you think you know what's really going on, you really don't. I'm going to read all of his other novels as soon as possible, with fingers crossed that they're as good as this one."
3,Good movie,"Film Name MANZIL MANZIL Banner NASIR HUSAIN FILMS PVT. LTD.

4,"Monster Magnet - 'Space Lord,Part 2' (Polygram International) 3-track UK issued CD single","Like I've mentioned before, I usually don't mess too much with CD singles. But this is a good one.From the space metal band's 'Powertrip' CD, this single has an edited version of it's title track ""Powertrip"", ""Space Lord"" and an OTHERWISE unavailable cut,the 'clean' edit of Monster Magnet covering MC 5's ""Kick Out The Jams"". Totally happening."
1,Not as advertised.,"Book was advertised as new for $123. It arrived with no cover, dirty, banged up spine, smudged, small size, and more text than photographs. No response when I emailed the seller. It's ridiculous. The book itself is worth $15 max. Published in 1998. Way over-hyped. I don't live in Maine anymore, but I'm 4th generation Mainer and the choice of photos is mediocre."

5,Gear Bag,"This bag is a must have if your kids are in sports. It is made of good strong, quality material. My boys pack it full with their sports stuff and it all fits!Another nice feature is it is a back pack so their hands are free. They love it!"
5,Really Compelling Stuff; They Get Into It,"Well, I was intrigued by a piece on war to start with, and not really familiar with Casella. And to hear music based on World War I newsreels fits in with my theatrical passions. I was mesmerized. Pages of War is worth the price of admission, and could provide the basis for a lecture on music and military tactics, it is so vivid. Program notes by Dr. Jurgen Thym are really helpful there. The Goetz Sonata is pure romatic drive from start to finish. Didn't know what to expect there. For listeners looking for something new that is both exciting and wonderfully performed and recorded, go ahead. Wish there was more of this kind of ""go for broke"" performing out there. Are you sure these guys are married?"
2,Sorry I bought it,"I was hoping to find good yeast bread recipes, but didn't. Their recipes used a lot of different flours that I probably would never buy. The book is not what I need and I am very sorry I bought it."
5,Great buy and gift,"This is a wonderful, easy to read cookbook. The introduction explains the specifics of celiac disease, gluten allergy and gluten intolerence. It describes the many types of gluten-free flours, including the sources, flavor notes, consistency and nutritional analysis. The recipes are straight-forward and very specific, there's no guesswork. I bought this for my grandmother who developed a wheat allergy as she got older. She has always loved to bake, so this is perfect for her to reinvent her recipes."
2,Wish I had not purchased,"I am writing a review to add to the others who have very neatly said what I think about this book: that it LOOKS like it will be a good book but when the recipes are followed, the results are quite mixed. Granted, there are a few good recipes in the book but you just never know which ones have been tested and which ones have fatal errors. Now that I own the book and can't take it back, I am very careful and make copious notes in the margins if I am brave enough to try a recipe. I need to buy some better gluten free baking books so I don't have to rely on this very flawed book."
3,What is book is about.,"This Book Is From The Forgotten Realms Box Set.This Book Is A Complete Guide To Campaigning In The Forgotten Realms, Including Two Introductory Mini-Adventures."
2,it's OK,"I got a Razr V3 phone earlier this year and purchased this charger/usb cable / data cd to go with it. The chargers are fine and the YSB cable works, but the 4.0 cd is out dated and does not work with my phone even though it says it will in the description/info provided by the seller. It was only $8 or $9 so for the chargers, it was worth the purchase, but if you're looking for the data cd so you can connect your phone to your computer, don't waste your money!!"
4,A helpful look into Musil's mind,"The fascinating man becomes clearer through the pages of his notebooks, which are uneven in their quality but ultimately rewarding. A must for Musil fans seeking to understand the mind of the genius."
4,Still one of the few to address ADHD in the workplace,"The update to Thom Hartmann's FOCUS ON YOUR ENERGY has been on the market a while now but deserves ongoing mention as still one of the few specific guides to address problems of ADHD in the workplace. ADHD SECRETS OF SUCCESS: COACHING YOURSELF TO FULFILLMENT IN THE BUSINESS WORLD tells how these behaviors can be adapted to successful, creative business solutions. Here he tells how adults who grew up with ADHD became successful in the business world - and chapters chart not just how, but pitfalls along the way."
5,A Stellar Record!,"I used to buy a ton of electronic records, but up until this record, there had been a large gap. The trouble was, so much of what I heard sounded unoriginal, and relied on trendy conventions, trends like microsound and glitchiness have gotten stale.This record stands out as a refreshing new direction in my listening. Integrating acoustic instruments and composition in a very eastern european/central asian sort of way, this record just oozes shuffley charm! How long has it been since you've heard a new record that made you want to tapdance? The record is extremely original, both in terms of composition, and instrumentation.This tasteful and original balance of originality and tradition is what makes this record worth listening to! Don't buy this if you are one of those serious types who likes to listen to somebody's science project Max/MSP patch. Or if you hate fun."
4,Very underrated!!!!!,This is better than nba live NHL whatever and maybe madden. This is about as close to real golf as possible. It gives you that golden tee feeling (that arcade game). It isn't easy which is good. The only set back is if you want to win alot of money you have to play a major tourny which takes about 4-6 hours. But its a great game and you should get it.
4,Love Unlimited White Gold,"Very rare CD. Lots of tracks not on other ""best of"" Cd,s. Going up in price, but still worth the money if you can get it.. Killer track is still Spanish lei! This is Barry White at the hieght of his success!"
2,A Disappointment,"I have been a Grappelli fan for years and this CD was a gift to myself. It has been a disappointment. When the focus is on Grappelli's violin, the CD is lives up to my expectation. Too often, however, the music is dominated by a ""jazz"" organ and deteriorates to a sound reminiscent of Musak. You will note that none of those segments are heard in the 60 second excerpts.I was excited when I ordered the CD. It was a surprising disappointment. I threw away the CD."
1,worst game,"this game was so terrible I stopped playing it after the first level, do not get this game it is a waste of money andit is a waste of time not only a waste of time, a waste of your life. Over all this game was a misfortune to have ever been made."
4,MOH: Rising Sun,"So, I got this game from a friend and he said i should try it out. Here's what I thought:Guns:8/10. Lots of different guns, with plenty of ear-popping sound effects. However, guns could have been made a little bit differently, slightly out of proportion in this game.Sound:9/10. Great music, lots of pops coming from incoming enemies, and realistic dialogue.Graphics:8/10: Some beautiful scenes in Pearl Harbor, The Temple, and a Bridge on the River Kwai make this game graphically gifted for the GameCube, but lip syncing is a bit off and the trees in the jungle levels look like they were cut out of green construction paper.Story line:9/10: Probably the longest in the series, however leaves you with a disappointing cliff-hanger at the very end.Overall:8.5/10 Great game with some graphical flaws and a limited-feeling range of missions. Definitely recommend for any GameCube user"
5,best moh game for gamecube,this is a great war game with great co-op play. i think the other two lack the co-op. you also get too shoot down enemy planes which is one of the best parts. the difficulty is hard even on easy but it makes it more fun. play all three of them.
5,Rising Sun Rocks!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I jst got this game a couple days ago but i love it. You have heard how it is short and easy well its not easy. I had to use cheats!. It is very fun though. The levels are great which make up for its shortness. This is the kind of game you play over and over and never get board. If you love the medal of honor games get this one. Its the best one yet!!
3,Any big battles?,Medal of honor rising sun is much less than it is hyped up to be. First off it is very very short and easy to beat. Also no major battles (Pearl Harbor isn't really a battle) with masses of soldiers are in here like Iwo Jima. Also their needs to be more of a squad unit fell to the game not this one man army destroying everything but their are pros. Easy to control weapons and etc... Just general fun. Mainly historically correct. Bonus objectives are good and so is cooperative mode. Level design was easy to follow with the exception of Midnight raid on Gundacal. Overall not as good as Frontline but solid and worth a rent or buy.
4,Great game but bad ending,"It was a geat game the whole way through grapics, AI, guns etcthe only flop was the ending sux you will think so to if you beat it. It left you thinking their should be another level thats why it got 4 stars"
4,History Without The Boredom,"Medal of Honor. The series is one of the best and most successful when it comes to dealing with WWII. EA(One of the best companies out there)always goes all out with this series. Not only that, it is realistic and based on fact and makes you feel as if your really there (thanks to the consulting work they do with Captain Dale Dye).All in all, MOH is still going strong and probaly will be 10, 15 years from now. Keep up the good work EA.FACT: Steven Spielberg created the series."
1,What happend to MOH????,"This game is TERIBLE with a capital ""T"". The player you are moves like molasses and you have horrible ammo capacity And RPM. THis game lacks realism and is very slow and borring i mean come on wouldnt you say MOH would be better off without this game????"
4,as good as it gets,it's beeter than frontline because of one thing only and that's the ai bots in multiplayer. BUY IT!
2,Not as good as frontline and dissapointing,"its not as good as frontline while the multiplayer is somewhat fun, it doesnt make up for the easy campaign mode which can be beaten in less then 10 hours. i can only reccomend this game to really big fans of MOH or just a weekend rental."
2,Not as good as frontline,"In 2003, i loved moh: frontline. so when i heard of a new moh, i went nuts. i coudn't wait. and i got the game, and I was so dissapointed. First, the story is incredibly dumb. you're a marine who has to find this japanese commander's gold. what does gold have to do with WW2? also, nothing changed from frontline at all, except for the new grenade button which is actually pretty useful. i cant say this game is really bad, but it is isn't as great as other WW2 shooters. the pearl Harbor mission is pretty fun, but it goes downhill from there. also, the missions can take you almost an hour to beat. It's just not that fun."
5,Awesome Action,This is a great action WWII game. It allows you to play the role of a US Allied Soldier while reminding you of the history behind that war.Challenging game too!!
3,Medal of Honor: Rising Sun,"This game is incredibly fun, but it is way too short. I beat the game after playing for only a couple of hours or so. The last mission leaves you with no conclusion and is a pretty ridiculous way to end the game. Where is the legendary atomic bombing of Huroshima and Nagasaki? Save your money and just rent the game for a few days."
3,Uh Yeah! Don't Know What Happend,"Well fist, I bought the game used after reading all the reviews. Good choice but i still felt a little cheated. I've played all the other MOHs, CODs, and BIAs just like everyone else but damn this game looks horrible but, i guess it is the game cube version, however thats no excuse. Suck it Soldiers! Make a damn good game you can be proud of....Am I LOUD AND CLEAR!The game to me still plays the same but if it doesn't make you feel like you are in a war and at any moment you could be killed by a sniper or piece of shrapnel then whats the point. Looking at the graphics like one reviewer said, ""Nintendo 64 graphics"" makes the whole game feel old and out dated"
3,A GOOD READ,"THIS BOOK WAS A GREAT READ... I CANT LIE IT TOOK A WHILE TO GET INTO. THERE WERE VERY INTERESTING PARTS BUT IT TOOK A WHILE TO READ. BUT ONCE I WAS DONE I WAS VERY SATISFIED TO HAVE PURCHASED THIS BOOK. I ONLY GAVE IT 3 STARS B/C OF THE SLOW PACE, IT TOOK ME A WHILE 2 READ AND I NORMALLY CAN GET IT DONE W/ IN A DAY"
3,And thats the way the cookie crumbled!,"This book had a good plot and story line, but it was just TOO fictional for me and had alot of unbelievable situations. And to be honest I really wasn't feeling Lady's character.This book was fast paced but had ALOT of speed bumps,I would recommend you pick it up from the library.The ending was ok but could have been better.Oh well!"
4,Just awsome,"I was blown away with this book. I even cried at the end. This book reaches out to everyone, whether your a Christian, or not, whether your young or old. To me this book was an insight in a lot of people lives that I can relate to. I just wanna thank Mark Anthony for writing this book. May God continue to bless you."
4,early takes,"""On the new premium quality Russian label Lilith, comes an astounding collection of early and rare takes (1970-1974) when LYNYRD SKYNYRD was only the name of the band's gym teacher. Amazing early versions of ""Free Bird,"" ""Gimmie Three Steps,"" ""Down South Jukin'"" and others makes for an awesome twelve-track attack that will remain in the annals of Southern rock. With liner notes in Cyrillic and a cardboard obi-strip on the left side of the digipack."""
2,Not impressed,"I've seen the comments on the other negative review of this book indicating that it's meant for adults - I don't see anything in the information relating to the book to indicate that, and my local library obviously didn't either because I found this little ""gem"" in the baby board books section. My toddler chose it, among others, to take out of the library. I wasn't aware that I had to check board books to make sure the content is appropriate before getting them out! My eyebrow raised at the penultimate page and I downright refuse to read it to her after seeing the last one!"
1,baby book about a hangover,"I read a review of this book and it sounded so cute and funny. A lot of my 1 year old newphew's first words were about food and he loves playing with kitchen utensils, so I ordered this book for him. It's great until the last 2 pages when the mom asks for 2 aspirin and says ""Now scoot. Mama's hung."" I can appreciate adult humor, but this just isn't funny. Great concept, poor execution.[...]. On a related note, he loves Baby's First Sushi Book."
3,Funny guy who was ahead of his time.,"Great writing (Judd Klinger, top feature screenwriter) and funny delivery from comedian Charlie Barnett (featured regularly on blockbuster cop action TV series, ""Miami Vice.""), but some of the interstitials were a bit sophomoric. Good time capsule for stand-up comedy. This guy greatly influenced new comedians like Dave Chappelle."
2,Confusing game board play,"Being a fan of Mario Party and Shrek Party, I thought Disney's Party would also be enjoyable. Unfortunately, I am irritated that I paid $40 for this thing. The game play is confusing and takes forever to set up and explain, the on-screen text (for the directions) is really hard to read and is extremely verbose.The mini-games are fun once you figure out how to play them, but game play is lame. You don't get to roll dice and move along a board. Instead, there is a little roulette that determines where you go. You have to play a bingo-style game with items and stars and there are these items, ""power notes"" and gems to keep track of (I can't even explain it in a way that isn't extremely confusing).Overly convoluted, confusing, poorly designed and difficult to read - stay away from this and get Mario Party (4 or 5) or Shrek Party."
1,Too Confusing!,"My family loves the Mario Party series and the kids can't get enough Disney. This seemed to be a perfect match.Unfortunately, it took over 3 hours for us to even begin the game after reading screen after screen of confusing instructions. Once the game started, it was difficult to figure out what was going on.There are so many layers to this game that don't seem to match up very well. Others have said that this game is great with persistence, but it's very difficult to keep a 4-year-old engaged in a game that us parents don't quite understand yet.I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone with young children or anyone who wants to pop in a game and start playing."
4,This is a great game to play with your kids!!,"My 5 year old daughter and my 10 year old son love this game. I sat down and played with it one day and have played it every day since. It took a little time for my 5 year old to understand the idea of the bingo card on the board game but once she figured out how to buy items, win stars in the mini game and place block items on other peoples bingo boards it has been a blast. This game is a lot like Mario Party only with the twist of the bingo cards. If you let the game run until after credits you will be rewarded with disney cards, there is no fast way to get to them but the kids enjoy looking through all the characters."
2,"Not a Mario Party clone, but could have been improved by it.","Disney's Party is, as stated in the title, not a clone of Mario Party. The minigames have more variety and are more skill based rather than button mashing or chance based, but the AI is cheap and merciless and the game has long unskippable scenes topped off with an insistence on tutorial every time you play. You can skip the tutorial, but still. The controls are good, but I just can't recommend this game. It could have been very good, but falls short. It's simply mediocre. Pass."
1,"Disney's ""potty""","AArgh!! Clean, colorful graphics cannot conceal how confusing and bizarre this game is. After placing the disc in and getting to the actual game, it was nearly 1/2 hour!!! before the ""game"" even began; endless, boring text instructions seemed to be all there was. I'm appalled at how awful most Disney games for Gamecube are but this one leads the pack in tedious, endless, vague tutorials. Time to flush this ""potty"" down."
3,Awesome!,"Only eight tracks though. I didn't finish listening to this CD, sometimes I don't finish listening to CDs that aren't really good. ""Concrete Schoolyard"" is the best out of all anyways. I really liked the mixes by Nu-Mark.-Raven-Symone Paradise"
1,Oooop,Don't even think this is good. The worst local hip-hop you heard in the street is better than this. This is awful. Just too bland. I tried to recycle my copy but the recyclers didn't want the scrap. Maybe the other J-5 disks are 5-star but this one isn't close.
1,Uniformly Horrible,"This EP contains 8 tracks over 22 minutes. Three of the eight tracks are commercials. The other five tracks are wack. This group has no production and no lyrical quality. The essence of being a good rap group is phat beats. This group has NO BEATS. Their verbal intros are so wack, so ..., its .... This is a very amateurish group. At best, they should be booked at a senior citizens center. I don't know who have been writing these other positive reviews but I wouldn't doubt that it is the members of J-5, their boys and their girlfriends.When I bought this CD, ... didn't allow us the ability to listen to some tracks. If you can listen to any tracks before buying do so. You will see that I am right."
5,positively phat,"simply, sick. J5 deserve all props they've been given across the board. This (and Quality Control!)is a package of conscious lyricism and phat beats that satisfy, whether your a hip-hop purist or just anyone with an open mind, respect for the ryhme (not the rap), and your own sense of time- pick up and feast your senses on this worthy production. Oh yes, and RESPEKT to the J5 crew, keep it real!"
5,Fresh 'n' raw......,"What a wonderful piece of work; short but sweet. These beats are real beats and hit home to all who love true hip hop. There should be another album coming out from J5 soon , or so rumor has it.... The rapping flows very naturally and the tunes are simply COOL. Buy it."
4,J-U-R-A-capital S-another S-I-C 5 mc's in the flesh...,"Jurassic 5 are dope. 2na is by far one of the best rappers right now. Although this cd is short, get it because it's good and not too expensive. I first heard 2na on a cd of this group called Ozomatli. His rapping style is so tight, and his lyrics just flow, it's rad. Buy this cd, and get the full length album when it comes out this summer too."
2,WAY TOO SHORT....EVEN FOR AN EP!!!,"As much as I'd love to give this EP a 5 star review, I can't. Jurassic 5 is an extremely talented group of emcee's, but I can't help but feel cheated by this EP. Out of the 8 tracks, only 4 are actually real songs. The other four tracks are brief, rather pointless interludes. When I paid $10 for an EP, I expect to get 8 actual songs, which is standard EP length. It's bad enough when an album is full of interludes, but it's ludicrious to put them on an EP. Still, I'll be looking forward to Jurassic 5's new, full length release this fall, which will hopefully contain more actual music from these entertaining emcees. NOTE: (I noticed that the amazon.com's track listing said that there was a 9th track called Blacktop Beat, however my CD doesn't contain that track)."
3,Mrs.Meyer's Lemon Vervena 8 oz Bar Soap,"Bought for my husband as he loves Lemon Verbena Soap bars, however, soap turned out to be not as fragrant & not as green toned as prior product (different brand). So will not buy again."
5,Lovely,I only use Mrs. Meyers soap (fabric softener and cleaner too). I first started using this soap when I went on a seven-day white water rafting trip--requiring a bio-degradable soap. I was hooked and have been using it now for a few years. The bar lasts a very long time and smells great. It is not too sweet or flowery. It is a fresh scent. I bought a case of 12 because I know I will use it. The lavender scent is also nice.
4,All natural goodness,"I picked up a bar of the Lemon Verbena on close out at a local store. I'm not a fan of lemon, but it was cheap and I like that Mrs. Meyer's products are not tested on animals and does not contain animal products. I'm pleased with this soap. The scent is not overpowering but is noticeable and pleasant. The soap is rather soft; it lathers up nicely, but the bar is used up quickly. Overall, though, it's a very nice soap especially if the bar is on sale."
4,Very cute,"This is adorable. I thought it was like a stuffed animal, but the wings are some sort of translucent-ish nylon or some such. That's ok which makes the wings light and the butterfly can ""fly"" well that way. Haven't tried it out on my grandson yet, but I like it!"
3,"Nice Pictures, Long Names","As an avid diver living abroad in the the vast Indo-Pacific region, I had a lot of interest in this book mainly since I was interested in knowing the English names of the marine life I was seeing. When I received it, I saw that there were nice pictures, but the headings under the pictures were almost all in Latin, with very few common names, unless they were extremely obvious ones. I'm not done picking through this book yet, but unfortunately, I am having a hard time picking the book back up, and trying to match my underwater videos to the pictures.I-a only-a eak-spa ig-pa atin-la!"
2,Little help for fish-lovers,"For casual fish identification, this book is fine, and it has tons of pretty photos of coral and other reef denizens. But if ""Hey, isn't that a butterflyfish? Pretty!"" is not enough for you, then having a single photo of each species (with only rare photos of female and juvenile forms and no text, for instance about how deep they live) will just not float your boat. . Depending on your destination, you'd be better off with the paperback ""Marine Fishes of Tropical Australia and South-East Asia."" Far more species, juveniles, terrific drawings and a just enough text to assist you with identification."
2,Deceptive,"This is not really a field guide. Rather, it's a general introduction to the various animals and plants found around coral reefs, plus colour photos (many quite small) of a representative sample. There are no species presentations, no keys. Frankly, the title of this book is deceptive!"
5,Great book,"As a diver and aspiring underwater photographer stationed in Okinawa, Japan, I have found that the pictures I take and want to identify are all in this book. It's great if you want to find out what fish/sponge/slug/anenome you took a picture of. Used my dive buddies for long enough, so I'm getting one of my own. Even though a lot of the names are italian, most fish have the common name. Definatly helpful if you're into underwater pics."
4,Indo-Pacific Coral Reef Field Guide,Best field guide that is in print for the Indo-Pacific Region. Used it to identify sea life on the Great Barrier Reef.
3,Ambitious but superseded,"I bought this book a long time ago, and while I still find it occasionally useful, I must also add it is quite superficial - many Indo-Pacific species are illustrated, but the accompanying texts are minimal, outdated or simply non-existent. To put it simply, it has been superseded by several newer titles devoted to the same area. Divers, underwater photographers and reef aquarium keepers should consider instead the more recent, complete, updated and infinitely better illustratedReef Fish Identification - Tropical Pacificby Gerry Allen,A Diver's Guide to Reef Lifeby Andrea and Antonella Ferrari andA Diver's Guide to Underwater Malaysia Macrolifeby Andrea and Antonella Ferrari - the latter, despite its limiting title, representing in my opinion the final word on Indo-Pacific critters, at least for the time being."
4,Indo-Pacific Coral Reef Field Guide,"This is the most comprehensive book we have seen, including fish, coral, underseas creatures and even birds and turtles! The pictures are excellent, but there is little description of the fish's habitats and behaviours, although MANY, MANY fish are covered! A thorough reference and one we'll use often when we are trying to identify what we took photos of!"
2,Not What I Expected,I found this book to be boring and tedious. It rambled and the characters didn't have any personality and I didn't find it humorous at all. I will probably read another one by this author just to give her a chance. But I was disappointed.
3,Good for the novice.,"This book is probably better suited for the average person wanting to know how to get their car REALLY clean. Pro deatailers may not get as much out of this as they would like. This book concentrates on what to do, in what order it should be done, and what products to use....and relies mostly on the directions on the products to give you instructions. The high points were the chapters on Wheels & Tires and Interior Detailing. I found they were the most detailed with the instructions given. This book also contains a chapter about Detailing as a Business. Gives the basics about how a detail business is operated. If you haven't read a detailing book before, I would recommend starting with this one before moving on."
2,The same old techniques discussed in other detail books,"Mr. Taylor has good general knowledge of detailing. How that knowledge would translate into information for experienced professionals is not clear. I can see an auto enthusiast gaining some good general knowledge from this book, however, the knowledge shared is both too general and lacks suffecient explanation. I still haven't found a book that truly shows how the professional detailers make a car into a work of art. Maybe this book comes close, but I was hoping for some honest to goodness tricks and insider techniques!"
4,"Slightly Better than David Jacob's, Chilton's","A ""newer"" book on autodetailing, pictures are actually well exposed and sharp. Better organized, helpful explanations, but again not enough for the novice. I.e.: says not to used silicon-based dressing on ragtops - why?"
1,No other words but Terrible!!!,"This is simply the worst ever single ever to be released on planet earth!!! Cartoons are just trying to cash in on young, gullable kids!"
4,Small book--big value,"A year with the Bible 2007 is an excellent guide for Bible study, if you use it properly. Don't expect to find commentary or devontionals. It provides a daily scripture selection, nothing more. It is an excellent guide for the mature Bible student who wants to keep a daily journal of readings, along his/her own thoughts and prayers on the readings. It is well balanced between New Testament and Old Testament readings and puts the user in several different Bible books each week.It is especially useful to members of mainline protestant denominations, such as Methodists, who follow the Episcopal Lectionary. All of the lectionary scriptures for the week are included, so that the user will read the scripture for the Sunday sermon in the preceding week. There are also some special prayers for various occassions at the end of the book. It is a huge bargain at less than a dollar a book."
2,Some things are best forgotten,"Two of the most mis-used terms in pop culture are the words ""psychedelic"" and ""acid"". I could do you an essay on how badly they have been abused by train spotters and marketing gurus over the years, but let's just stick to this CD.I waited a long time to acquire this and was it worth it? Hell no. Basically this is straight funky rhythms with distorted wah guitar solos. End of story. Oh yeah - and some of the most horrendous hippy lyrics ever written on the vocal tracks. It is similar in a lot of ways to the Electric Prunes ""Mass in F minor"", but at least the vocals on that one were in latin so you didn't have to cringe your way through them. I'm sure some ""psychedelic"" train spotters will get off on it for the guitar playing, but I only give it 2 stars because of the connection to James Brown and the overall standard of the arrangements.Sorry folks, but this one was best left in the can."
1,WARNING. Not compatible with XBOX 360,"If you have an original XBOX, Then don't mind my review, Otherwise DO NOT BUY THIS GAME, I bought this game when Yahoo Answers said it would work on XBOX 360, When it didn't, instead. i Get this Not Supported with XBOX 360 message, If you have original XBOX, then this might be for you, If you Have 360, DO NOT BUY!!"
4,It is great,I great the grafics are good but the steering is bad. It needs to have beter steering the car.
2,Broke,Really liked right up until I was trimming a branch and the one handle snapped in two.I'm really not that strong.
3,Miss the power gear,This anvil is OK. Works great. But I miss the power gear effect on it. Next time I will go for the one with power gear.
5,Worth the money,I paid $9.something for these. They work well and can cut some fairly thick branches also. Good buy. Goodbye.
4,Good thing I am not a bush.,"Ames true temper prunes so easy. The grip on the handle is very comfortable. Snip , snip, snip."
4,A great look at Industrial,"It's suprising to see K-Tel still in exhistence, and even more surprising to see an Industrial Compilation from them.. What's even more surprising is the fact that it's a great compilation. It covers almost the entire span including the rawer stuff from the early 80's (Einsturzende, Chrome, Throbbing Gristle) all the way up to the later 21st Century stuff (Apoptygma) Anyone who has been interested in Industrial has eventually gone out and looked for every band on this list. Here's an Industrial comp that represents the music and not a particular label. I would definitely recommend this to the younger tribe just starting out, or the older tribe looking for a quick nastalgia fix."
3,Industrial Ktel ???!!!,"Ktel with an industrial compilation ? Too funny ! The Industrial Gods were not smiling the day this disc was released. It's actually pretty good, but falls into the trap of trying to cover too much ground, thus making it rather uneven. A better place to start is ""Industrial Madness"" or ""Industrial Revolution"" Vol. 2 & 3. Just the Ktel name gives me the creeps...3.5 Stars."
1,not entertaining,"I will start off by stating that I had no idea what I was getting into, I had added The Secret to my instant Q some time ago and finally decided to watch it. For one, David Duchovny cannot act, the only thing he was ever good at was being Mulder. Two, creepy implied incest just does not do it for me. Not only was this the most boring movie of my life it was also one of the most appalling (and I have seen every Takashi Miike movie ever made). I cannot even begin to fathom why people are giving this movie positive reviews. The only thing I can come up with is that certain people just feel the need to like or pretend to like the taboo. Just because something is taboo does not mean it is cool or sexy or entertaining. Watching this movie was the biggest waste of my time."
2,Uneven and unsatisfying,"This film is one of those that takes itself too seriously and in so doing ceases to remember that movies are first and foremost about entertainment. If you want to show you have depth become a swimming pool and if you want to send a message go to Western Union.It began with a good idea, promised to deal with real human emotions and then became a disappointing cliche of PC whining, absurd plot resolutions and self-indulgence. Ultimately the emptiness of the plot is not the actor's faults, but rather that of the preachy and simple minded writer.Save your nickel for something worth buying."
3,Borders on Creepy.....,"While this movie doesn't quite cross the line (comes damn close), its hard to get past the creepiness of a Dad cuddling, and behaving in an intimate way with his daughter. The big revelation that the mom learns about her daughter is not so interesting. The daughter is nothing but a slut and druggie.Movie is just ok. Worthy of a rental, but barely."
1,too weird and awkward,"If I could I would give this movie half a star. What an awkward movie! I had no idea when I rented this from work(blockbuster) that it was going to be that awful. A lot of people before the movie came out were asking about it, so i decided to see it to see what the hype was about. I felt the acting was terrible, Sam the 16 year old daughter that the mother's spirit goes into plays a poor part as an adult. Frankly its just too weird seeing the daughter come on to her own dad.Although its not really her, its the mother. I turned this movie off aftering watching half of it. I didnt deem it worthy enough to watch the rest. This movie does not rent well at Blockbuster, at least the one I work at. There are far better movies out right now that you can spend $4.88 on. Please do not waste your time as I have."
2,"Sorry, but to be interesting, it needed to ""cross the line"".","For those who would not have bought it/went to see it if it had, fine. But it had to have extrmely good reason not to, not simply fear the audience would be limited. Fiction doesn't frighten/gross me out. But, then, I know the difference."
3,music?,"I'm a huge Duchovny fan, and he was great in this... it's definitely a very interesting film, and worth renting, imo.I'm wondering about certain music that was used in the film though-- specifically, what are the songs in the following scenes: a) when Hannah and Ben are kissing on the couch on their ""night alone,"" b) when Sam/Hannah asks Ben to dance with her, when she's in the nightgown, and c) when Sam/Hannah does the shot at the party.Any help?"
4,Wow!,"Why doesn't Olivia Thirlby get more jobs. Very impressive. She played this role better thatn anyone I could think of and I've been a Duchovny fans sine ""The Files""."
2,Lack of tournaments,Yes the graphics have been improved rather well but after A while this game becomes unchallenging.Unlike previous fifa's this one contains no european champions like tournament or international tournament. You cannot even play in the premier league tournament anymore with fellow players.This is the game for you if you like endless friendly games or the domestic cup games of small european countries.I prefer the 2003 set up.
4,FIFA 2004,"This is a must game for soccer fans and for everybody who is interested in learning about soccer. Have fun and enjoy! Best game on the planet! Graphic makes it super realistic. It's like ""watching"" a real game with the real players. Actually it's better, cause you're playing. Full of surprises for the lover of sports.."
2,"Good depth, but poor gameplay","First with the good. I loved how they added English 1,2 and 3 divisions. There are the lower Italian and Spanish divisions, too. The graphics are good, as are the stadiums.Now the bad. The AI goalkeeper, regardless of the team, is SICK. I mean, they block EVERYTHING. It becomes very frustrating. But your goalie, which is controlled by the cpu, is border-line retarded. Also, free kicks are IMPOSSIBLE, even with the best players. I've only made one. I've tried nearly everything, from different combinations of spin and power, and NOTHING SEEMS TO WORK.I'm hoping for improvements in 2005, but after this year's disappointment, I probably won't get it."
3,It needs to merge with world tour soccer!!!!!!,"The game itself is not bad, although it needs alot of work.i do believe that ea sports can do better or may be they are not trying hard to really improved it.World tour soccer and Fifa 2004 , ummmill take world tour.alot of the real moves are missing and the worst is thatyou can't even play a world cup!EA SPORT TOOK MY MONEY!!!!"
5,the best game on earth,"I just want to answer to the guy who said soccer is the worst sport on earth. If you don't like soccer it's ok, but if you say that a 14 yo guy is a star, as far as I know, he's not playing in Europe yet... so the first thing you should do is to learn about soccer before critizing it. And it's the number one sport in the world for its number of fans. If Americans don't like it it's not soccer's problem, it's America's problem who always try to go against the rest of the world, especially for the lack of culture in people like you, if you don't think so ask Iraquis..."
4,E3 Impression,"I was able to play FIFA 2004 at E3 this year in Los Angeles. I was impressed with the improvements over the 2003 iteration, and believe EA is quickly catching up to Pro Evolution in terms of solid gameplay."
3,A good deal,"$35 for 100 bits is a steal. The case doesn't snap shut, and the bits smell a kinda funny, but other than that they appears to be machined pretty well."
2,smuggy screen,The screen would have been great for the price but....there are stickers on the screens labeling the top and bottom. When you try to get the stickers off all the glue from the stickers stays on the screen and I have not figured out how to get it off without really messing up the screen. It is still usable but you have this blurry smudge up in the corner that keeps catching my eye.
1,Poor choice for protectors,"As stated, the adhesive used for the stickers is a very bad choice, it does not peel off and pretty much permanently stays on your screen. Stay away."
4,Nintendo DS Lite (Gold) Safe Screen,This was easy to apply to the unit. No smudges on the screens and the pen still responds correctly. Great product.
4,A must have.,"Easy to put on, even comes with a little squeegy(sp?) for ironing out the bubbles. Get this before scratching up your screen!!!"
1,Fatal Flaws of the Nintendo DS Lite Safe Screen,"The Nintendo DS Lite Safe Screen's fatal flaw is that the manufacturer affixed instruction labels to both the front and back of each screen. These labels were attached with an adhesive that adhered to such an extent that when pulled as instructed, the label tore, leaving paper fibers and, yes,adhesive permanently attached to the screens. This renders the screens completely useless. In addition, each screen is slightly warped. Because of the way the product is packaged, there is no way one could return the flawed screen to Amazon for a refund. Therefore I would strongly recommend that you not purchase the Nintendo DS Lite Safe Screen.Intec Safe Screen - Game console screen protector - transparent"
3,DS Screen Protector Mandatory!,"A screen protector actually can make the difference between a ruined DS and one that lasts for years. It all depends on the games that you play. If you play games like Harvest Moon DS and Lost in Blue2, the Touchscreen will be attacked by the stylus in an aggressive fashion. If you lack a screen protector, your screen can be ruined by diligent gameplay! I wish I had bought one at the very start... I never will use the DS without a screen protector again when playing games that actually use the incredible potential of the Touchscreen.Of course, if you are playing games that simply require an occasional tap of the stylus on the Touchscreen, you may not need a protector... The games that use the Touchscreen creatively require the protector."
1,Urban Sloth,"What a disaster. You apply the plastic protector to the video screen and then remove the sticky tabs from it. The sticky tabs are provided as a convenience for helping you place the protective screen. Easy enough right? Wrong. The tabs leave a film that you can't remove. As a result, you can't see through the protective screen to the game screen. The manufacturer states that this product will prevent your DS screen from being damaged. They never said you'd be able to see through it to the screen."
4,Make sure you have steady hands,This safe screen do a good job of protecting the DS Lite's screens. Make sure you clean your NDS screen well before applying the protective screen.
4,WORK'N THE BRAIN...OH YES,"I DEFINITLY HAVE SEEN AN IMPROVEMENT IN MY MEMORY AND LOVE THE CHALLENGES!DS LITE: GAMES: ""BRAIN AGE 1&2"" AND ""LEFT BRAIN/RIGHT BRAIN"""
2,This is not what you want,"I bought this and a t-mount to allow me to take pictures through the eyepiece. It works, it does what it claims, it's pretty well built, but the pictures are terrible. Even perfectly aligned and focused, your pictures will be blurry and sad. I will try to upload two pictures. I used this a few times and it has sat unused for two years now. I only used it on an old telescope, never bothered on my new one, so maybe you can get better results, but I wouldn't endorse it.I was able to reuse the t-mount I bought for this with a t-adapter and take great pictures of the moon using my Canon Digital Rebel SLR and some okay pictures of the Orion Nebula, but that was about it. If you want to take pictures of planets consider a webcam-type camera like the Celestron NexImage (it works ok) for $100 (and use software like Registax) or spend many hundred dollars on a good imager. You will NOT get good results with a consumer camera combined with ANY adapter on the market."
1,"Not a ""standard"" bulletin board",This isn't a corkboard-type bulletin board. You can not put push-pins/tacks in it. It is just a heavy cardboard material to put on a wall. The vendor was nice enough to return the product though.
3,Just a little side note...,"Joan Jett hasn't released too much new material in the nineties, but many fans may not be aware that she did front a group the group Evil Stig in 1995, and they put out a really nice record (in memorial to the Gits former frontwoman Mia Zapata). Check it out. Fetish is okay, but kind of a disappointment. We await something new from this legend - see her live and it's obviously she's still got it!"
5,Joan Jett Fan,I have been a Joan Jett fan since the early 80's and this cd is absolutely awesome. You will not be disappointed!
2,STILL the newest Joan Jett record!,"Well, any new fans of Joan's who want & need the latest thing she's done will have to be satisfied with this. A tasteless and somewhat slapped-together collage of sexy songs that just doesn't do Jett justice. Is longtime friend/mentor/manager Kenny Laguna happy with this new image?? I'm a hardcore fan from 1981 and I'm not."
1,The WORST OF JOAN JETT plus two bonus tracks!!!!,This cd is clearly one of the biggest ripoffs in the recording industry. Jett took a bunch of her worst songs and tagged on two additional new songs hoping that her audience (which hasn't gotten any new music from her since 1994) would buy it. While the two new tracks are enjoyable the rest of the album is tripe. (...)
2,Forgetish....,"Reworking old songs, an electronica sounding album, poor production and extremely weak lead guitar (due to the absence of Ricky Byrd). This is truely the end for Joan Jett. This album is for die hard fans only. Unlike Jerry Lee Lewis, this is ""all filler and NO killer"". There is not any comparison to this and her classic release ""I Love Rock & Roll"". I hope I am wrong, but look for Joan Jett to join the ""Essential"", ""Greatest"", ""Ultimate"", ""Remastered w/ Bonus Track"", ""Anthology"" has-been tour for cash in the near future."
2,Where's Wanna be your Dog?,I'm a longtime fan and admirer of Joan and her music but her new album is way overdue. This is just like throwing her fans a bone with a couple of new songs and unreleased live tracks......and speaking of bones......Where is I wanna be your dog???......that is one of the most sexual songs Joan ever recorded.....guess Up Your Alley is still selling well enough to leave it off.
3,Joan rocks like nobodies business,"This is a very good CD. I saw Joan & co. last year in Tuzla, where they played a lot of the songs ont his CD. (I agree with the earlier review, too, that WANNA BE YOUR DOG should be here!) Joan rocks like no one else. Some long time Blackheart fans appear to have been disappointed based on above reviews, but I hadn't heard her for a while, and this was enough to bring me back."
3,Nice Collection needs more new songs,"I already have this CD with 1 less songs from the Joan Jett Fan Club. This re-release adds ""Black Leather"" (live). While ""Fetish"" & ""Baby Blue"" (not the Badfinger song) are fine new tracks, Joan needs to get an full album of totally new material out. She has an album ""in the can"". All the fans know this. She just needs to find a distributer who will promote and distribute her. She has a new look and an even harder edge, but is still a great songwriter and performer. She has a very strong fan base but radio seems to like more feminine women with acoustic guitars. Joan was a pioneer for the female rocker. Fetish is a nice collection of tracks dealing with the subject of sex. She has never avoided this subject before and doesn't here. This collection ROCKS. But it could have benefited from the songs ""Just Lust"" and ""Torture"" also. why leave those off? Only ""Wooly Bully"" bores me. It's not needed. I can't wait to hear Black Leather (Live)."
3,Amanda Blake Betrayal,The movie would not play in my blu ray player and I have to watch it on my laptop. The movie arrived on time and I have no other issues with this product.Betrayal (UK PAL Region 0)
5,The Man has done it again!,Powerful new music from the Mojo Man himself. Its Henry with a whole new passion! Definately worth the wait! Anyone out there who is a Henry Lee fan should own this one!Visit the HLS website for new info on the man... www.henryleesummer.comOther CDs available: LIVE (2 cd recording of his fav live songs!)Coming soon- A NEW CD!
1,Wrong picture for title,This DVD seems to be a Black and White film and not the Telenovela as the picture shows.
4,Great series,"This is a great series. I like book 2 better than this one, but the images are still great."
2,"Failed, not repairable","This toaster started out working just fine, but after less than two years it stopped toasting bread on both sides. The customer service department informed me that the heating elements could not be replaced, so instead of a working toaster, I had another piece of junk for the landfill. I had hoped with the sterling reputation of the Dualit brand, the toaster would give us many years of service. The good old American-made toasters of the past are still around, but sadly do not have wide enough slots to accommodate bagels or today's larger bread slices. To replace the Dualit, I visited the thrift store and paid $7.99 for a Chinese-made toaster that is (so far) working well enough to tolerate. If it gives out, at least I won't feel like I got ripped off!"
5,Simply an outstanding & gritty book!!,"This book methodically moves through Peter MacDonald's political life, but offers a biting criticism of the hypocritical nature of American politics. How can it be, MacDonald ask, that congressional people can do what I did, and NOT be held accountable for their actions? This compelling question is often repeated throughout the book & does deserve serious treatment by Indian and nonIndian scholars alike. MacDonald also eludes of ""two standards of justice"" for American politicians, an undisputed standard that is clearly separated by color! This book is essential reading for those interested in the rise and fall of a modern-day Indian leader and the compromises he has made to maintain his political life."
5,Excellent account of Peter McDonald,"This book was great and very insightful of the Navajo people and the Navajo Nation. My family filled in the blanks and questions I had, as their all full blooded Navajo and knew of Peter McDonald. I enjoyed the book and learned alot."
3,Thurston john Moore cage and my cat Is an Alien,Excellent transfigured music. Thurstoned is raw and in your face taking you into a piano black hole there is something after that but my head is so jaded that I will catch it after a while.My Cat Is An Alien is better for my mind and ears and worth the $20 for its rarity.
5,Love You Leroy,"This band is awesome. The first 5 songs on the CD are full of that rhythmic zydeco beat that a 2-stepper loves. He has a nice blues tune on there also. Not as good as Leroy ""Live,"" but it is still great."
3,Eh...,"We have looked at it a couple times, but never has it been brought to me to be read... It was bought for my daughter for Valentine's Day."
5,Very interesting and historial,This was a very informative and interesting true life adventure. The author has an unique way keeping the whole book interesting.
5,Loved it!,"There's no plot here and certainly no white knuckle drama. The book is a series of essays, each chapter relating an event or way of life experienced by the author as a child growing up on the North Dakota plains during tbe early 1900s. From education to farm life to holidays, each was covered with love and humor. I felt like I was getting to know my own grandmother as a child. My only wish was that there were more photographs, but considering the time period it was wonderful to have a few."
3,Wasn't expecting a poem.,I didn't know Gene Stratton Porter wrote this poem. I was only familiar with her books which I had mostly read. It's nice to have them on my Kindle.
2,duped boobs,I was really excited when I saw this was going to released on dvd. because the vhs was just a fuzzy version. but to my dismay all the dvd is the vhs fuzzy dupe on a disc. not a studio or professional job. was very disappointed. I have purchased unreleased dvds and expected that. but not when you pay $22 plus shipping for some fuzzy work.with that said I wanted this movie becasue it is a funny satire 1970's style. full of familiar faces and boogey music. its like a old sit-com with nudity. and for that I am glad to own it. just wish when they announced the release they meant a new and clear copy. not just the same old thing on that vhs tape.
1,VERY POOR BOOTLEG FROM VHS COPY,Jef Films also sell this & their other boots on EBAY. 99 cents is too high a price to pay for this. A real studio should release this.
3,not quite that type of movie.,"This movie is not quite hard core porn, most of the sex scenesare implied. It is kind of funny because it has Linda Lovelace fromDeep Throat in it and also has Mikey Dolenz from the Monkees."
5,NHL 2004 Much better,A very good game better than 2003 version . I like the road uniforms at home this year . Seems to be faster as well . Havent played much of it just got it . I do like it and I think we'll make the Bruins cup winners !!! Way to go NHL 04 !!!
2,Good Options. Bad camera views...,"When I bought NHL 2004 I thought it was going to have the same camera angles as 2003 but I was totally wrong. When you are going up the ice and you are on the wall you can barely see the puck and the player is small.(action view) Going down is fine because the camera is closer but overall the camera view is dissapointing. The fighting is not easy to do and not as fun as in 2003.I did like the new options with the dynasty mode and the Elite league. I also like the way you can check with bruise control.Overall, I think that EAS put too many options into the game instead of sticking with better gameplay. While the options are better in this game, I would suggest ESPN hockey 2004 because of better gameplay."
3,Fun for a few minutes,"I saw this in the store years ago & loved it. Purchased on-line. It appears that maybe people had been playing with it too much in the store still strapped in teh box. Because the hydrolics didn't work correctly. We were able to fix it, but the car Bangs down hard each time. The loud clunking noise interferres with enjoying the song. It may have only been the one we received. Like I said, maybe played too much while strapped into the box. The hydraulics should be able to freely move in the display box to prevent this from happening."
5,Work of Art,"I enjoy reading books based upon Business like themes, and I must say that this is one that has completely stood out from the rest that I have read. I recently started my own business after 20 years of experience, and I must say that this book covers not only all the basic methods to start a business, but also to make it shine amongst the rest. It is practical and brilliant at the same time, and very easy to follow for anyone who has the motivation to start their own business. Pave your way to success and climb to the top, using this book as an essential tool."
4,Great tool for people new to business planning...,"I bought this book hoping to get ideas for rewritting my business plan for fitness and nutrition business, Seven Wellness. There are several ideas I pulled out of the book and have implemented into my planning. It's easy to read with a step-by-step plan.Wishing you the best with you business planning and future success,Chris Knight - Owner of Seven Wellness"
4,Good Book for those just starting out,"I bought this book for my son, he found the book very informative and helpful good for anyone who is just starting out"
2,Weak Center Speaker,"While the other speakers and sub woofer are fine, the center speaker is simply too weak and after a little use began crackling at times. Unfortunately, the center speaker is where most of the dialogue in movies comes from, so if it's weak the rest of your surround speakers don't matter too much. I returned this item as a result and upgraded to some nice Harmon Kardon speakers that cost twice as much but are worth it.Also, one other thing that wasn't a big deal but was a bit annoying was the auto on/off with the sub-woofer. It worked fine, but when it turned on and off it would make a loud clicking noise, usually at the beginning of a movie once the low frequency clicked in. Not a big deal, but worth mentioning."
2,Flat speakers = flat sound.,"I bought this for the COD game (PC). Why did I buy it? The speakers are all very flat and I didn't want to put larger speakers on my game table. All I can say is the sound just isn't that good and the subwoofer is below average at best. It is probably better to spend a little bit more and get better speakers for superior sound. Right now, Amazon has the Pinnacle Speakers SUBSONIX 5.0 for only $249. It is a steal and it is a much better buy than this Sony system."
3,Great for the price.,"Well worth the money, but I did need to upgrade the center channel speaker. It was because you had a hard time with dialoge in movies. The Sub is fine and the satalites are good so all in all it was a good deal."
1,"Biased, ill informed, and out of date","Mr. Milton's observations were ill informed and biased when he first made them. By the time he updates this book for today's audience, he's hopelessly out of date."
1,Misinformation,"The most biased anti-insurance book I have ever read. Insurance is a complex tool which can be great when used properly, and harmful if not."
1,"Boring, monotonous and rushed edition","Difficult to listen to and absorb the details of the narration, as it is done in a very rushed, unexpressive and unthoughtful manner. I would suggest Scourby or Waggoner (eBible) as much better, realistic and well-done editions."
1,QC is terrible.,I can't comment how it actually sharpens because I was never able to use it. The first one I received had a broken handle which was promptly returned for replacement. Second one had a severe curve to the sharpening surface. I was willing to try for a third but Amazon's policy on replacements revented it so I settled for a refund.
4,Diafold Ceramic/Extra fine,"I have several diafold sharpeners already, but I really liked theidea of having the ceramic side as well. Now that I have it, theceramic side is not quite what I expected. It's a bit rougher ( dueto the holes like the diamond side ) than I expected. It works well,but I'd prefer a smooth ceramic ( without the dimples ). Other thanthat, it works GREAT!"
3,Item arrived damaged,"As far as the actual screen goes, I am pretty happy with the quality of it. We use it in our main church auditorium (small church, seats about 70) and it looks nice, functions well and was much easier than painting the wall with screen paint. My only issue was like so many other reviewers, the item was slightly damaged right out of the box. I didn't feel like boxing it back up and sending it back because from a distance it isn't that noticeable, but it's disappointing to get a brand new item that arrives dented. I only gave it three stars because of inferior packaging."
5,Great screen,"Yes you are making the right choice. Bought this screen and love it. The smell of the new screen was pretty stong for first few weeks but got a lot better. Don't worry about all the technical stuff and hype that the screen people try to sell you on a more expensive screen the bigger the better and you just lower or raise the screen to accomodate for the aspect ration 4:3 16:9 etc... If you dont get this screen at this price you are missing out. Have a killer surround sound system with it and we have not been to the movie theater since, just rent the new releases and go home to our own theater. The popcorn and drinks are lots cheaper at home!!! LOOKING TO GET THE HOME MOVIE EXPERIENCE THEN GET THIS SCREEN!"
3,All that matters to me is the picture,"and the picture is great. I've got this paired with the BenqW1000 and it's wonderful. It was easy to mount, you have to provide your own screws and anchors and a level and a person helping you, but you don't need any special hooks or mounts as they're part of the unit. It can be tricky to get it to roll back up and it took me a few times to get the feel for it. It still sometimes doesn't roll up all the way. The most annoying thing for me is that on mine the bottom isn't exactly parallel with the top, it's an anal thing, but it bugs me. I let it go because the picture is so great and the price is so nice. It came packaged very well albeit in a loooong box and had no damage. I love watching movies on this thing."
5,Da-Lite Projection Screen,"This is a well-made screen that is easy to mount--though it comes without mounting hardware since there are so many different ways to mount it. It operates smoothly and provides a good, flat surface without any waves. The price makes it a good screen to start with since even a later upgrade will not result in a huge expense wasted."
4,Screen for gazebo,I bought this screen to mount in an outdoor gazebo to use with my projector for movies and sporting events. The screen was easy to mount and works great. The only thing that the 10' long box is hard to handle and during shipping the metal frame was damaged. There was not sign of the damage to the box and it was not until I got it open did I notice the dents. It wasn't worth trying to box it back up and ship it back. It still works though.
5,Exceptional,"This was a gift for my son, arrived in a timley fashion was exactley as desribed, he was thrilled, will definatley reccomend to others."
3,Something's wrong with the controler!?,"This game has the better graphic compare with other soccer games. That's about it. FIFA 2003 played better, in 2004 you have to push R button after you get the ball, otherwise your player will run slowly even if you push the control stick as hard as you can. But if you push R button then it's easy to lose the ball. Without pushing the R button, you are too slow for the opponent to get the ball from you, you can't be in control of the ball as good as in 2003."
3,FIFA'S SOCCER GAMES ARE STARTING TO GET BORING,I've played all fifa soccer games and I think that they don't offer something different. Maybe Fifa 2003 is the best of all the previous fifa's games but in the end is all the same. I bough Fifa 2003 because I'm a fan of Barcelona team and I like to play with real player's names. But I think that there are another better soccer games and I think that those titles deserves the license to create a game with real leagues teams and real players.
5,Much better than expected.,"At first glance, one might be inclined to think, ""Typical weird '80s movie"". But with a campy feel and the added bonus of Jane Kaczmarek (of ""Malcolm in the Middle"" fame), this moves to cult classic. A '60s greaser, Bobby, comes back after a fiery car crash to be a kid's guardian angel, and only if he helps does he gain entrance to ""uptown"" (Heaven). Powerful moments come when Bobby sees his '60s girlfriend all grown up. Surprisingly deep movie from what could've been just another hijinks buddy comedy."
4,Heavenly Kid.......................,Jason Gedrick was pretty funny about a geek who's shy and finds out that you can get the girl! Bought the movie and it's a family movie that everyone will enjoy.
5,Family Musicians Share,"This is a wonderful CD. My family has owned it for years and it is one of our Family Classics. The CD is like a slice of life musical day of a musical family, with Dad and Mom and 2 children (a young girl and baby boy?). It's like someone recorded their day without conversation. You get to see how a family in love with music lives with their children. There is a theme...a girl wakes up and wants a tea party. Listen to the audio clips, you'll see. Buy it, you won't be disappointed!! (if you're like me and hate the pop or mass market versions of Mother Goose). This is reall stuff."
5,Love the non-digital effects,I forgot how impressive these special effects were. I saw this at a Drive-In when I was a kid and it's just as cool now.
5,The best SMG album yet,I started listening to Sister Machine Gun in 1996 and have been a fan ever since. I didn't know what to expect with this album but I was totally surprised when I got it. This is definately the best SMG album yet. SMG albums have always fused various musical styles and [R]evolution is no exception. Definately music for sex and dancing!
4,Good Stuff,That first review was bogus. The CD is fine - it has all the songs you only get to hear at weddings.
1,Holy crappy wedding batman!,"Okay so this was given to me as a gift for my upcoming wedding... and HOLY COW... I wouldnt play this if my life depended on it-The macarena? Do you really hate your family that much?The dollar dance? I swear only the trashiest people in the world ask for money at their own wedding.Instead of buying this horrible album of the worst songs ever written, why dont you and your beloved put together songs you actually like, and enjoy the wedding.Just because everyone isnt doing the chicken dance doesnt mean your wedding wasnt memorable- people will instead walk away saying ""that was the classiest wedding i have ever been to""Its not a charade, its a wedding- this cd should be burned"
4,"Are you a fan? If so, this book is for you","I have followed leonardo's career for a while now. I feel that he is an amazing person with incredible talent towards the movie industry and enviromental issues that have plagued humans for years. This book was very useful in understanding more about the actor I encourage you to at least take a browse through the book, trust me you'll enjoy it."
4,"very,very good!","this book is full of quotes, pictures and info... it's just what a fan of Leonardo DiCaprio wants' to own... i really enjoyed reading it! chek it out!"
4,A bit hard to operate,"This is a beautiful puppet. I gave it only 4 stars, because even for an adult, it is quite hard to get the wings moving. But other than that it is a great toy and very realistic."
4,Good adaptor,"I use this to mount my Canon 40D to Nextar 8SE. It is simple to use, however, threading in the dark can be tough. I suggest putting this on first and then mount your camera.You must remember that the focal length changes with the removal of the eyepiece, therefore, you photo will not be as magnified. You will be able to photograph the moon with much clarity and the major craters and plains are visible.I give this a 4 simply because of the threading issue."
2,A waste of money,"This book basically goes through what the options are under file, edit, view, etc. The help menu in the program would suffice for this. It also does not go through enough examples of when you would use the options."
4,Overall a good CD however certain things where lacking,"I enjoyed this CD. From the isle of Eire to the climatic finale with Dayhak this music catches the soul and makes you feel weak at the knees. Joesph LaDuca has truly done it again. My only complaint was that there is still more music that has yet to be released. Even though we got to hear the Widow Twanky's solo we still have not heard the dance piece that made it famous in the last season. Also other things that were missed, like the death of Alchmene, and the funeral of Sarina right after Lucy Lawless's solo. these are just some to name a few. The lack of pieces reminds me of what John Williams does on his Star Wars soundtracks. Just leaves those little things out. Other than that a excellent CD"
1,publisher refused to sell answer keys to student!!!,writing is good but why don't you publish a solution manual for profit??? our instructor is lazy to provide any further material to students!!!
2,Not one of the best,"This recording is worth having for its inclusion of the Nielson, and Fischer deserves recognition for his advocacy of new music. Pianist Richard Zimdar's consummate musicianship also requires acknowledgment. Despite these salient points, I cannot say that Fischer is particularly listenable. His technique, while developed, does not reach the levels of artistry one would expect from a DMA in performance--particularly in the altissimo range; it is almost painful to hear so much portamento (that is, unintended scooping into and out of pitches rather than landing directly on them). Further, there is little to no evidence of musicianship in Fischer's performance. Compare to Mule, Bongiorno, and the superb if less-known Clifford Leaman (check out his interpretation of the Bassett) and you will find that this saxophonist has many superiors in every aspect."
4,Music Mixer is actually pretty good for a mere $20.,"I don't know why this has received such a bum rap. For only $20 you get the ability to transfer your files to your xbox. Sure, MP3s take longer, but WMAs are pretty fast. Make sure to turn your firewall off or open ports TCP 3074 and UDP 3074 if you are using the wireless adapter and a router.Also, the Karaoke is actually pretty fun. My kids and I hooked up the microphone and the xbox live headseat and had fun singing and then listening to the recorded performances. Most of the included songs are pretty bad, but there are a couple of good ones. The vocal stipper works OK too, or you can just sing along and not worry about it.Again, this is only a $20 set-up, not a $200 Karaoke machine. I think it performs adequately given the price. Yes the controls can be confusing but the ability to share music files with the xbox is great and I've gotten $20 of fun out of this."
1,Avoid; Pricey and Disapointing,"Terrible in almost every way. Not HD (as claimed), ugly UI, overpriced and poor quality karaoke tracks, difficult to use, and poorly integrated with existing Windows networks. This is a product that cries out for seamless integration with your home music library which the current Xbox deliberately avoids. The few karaoke tracks that are available are overpriced and not what anyone really wants to play with anyway."
3,Cool Fun - Cheap Karoake Machine!,"I have read some reviews that were terrible about the Music Mixer. I see it like this: If you want a fun add-on to your xbox for only $40, this is definately worth the money. If you are looking for a high-end karoake machine, this is not it."
1,a dj from Brooklyn n.y.c,I dont have a x-box my question is can I make music (beats) on the x-box M.M. or this a very expensive karaoke machine? I have asked every one about music mixer. and no one knows. Can I make music on it besides using the karaoke machine? is it like the MTV Music generator1&2/Music Maker/ejay Club World for playstation and I understand Playstation is coming out with a karaoke verision./..so is it worth it to get an X box for music mixer? I hope some one could answear my question?
4,SO AMAZON/AMAZING,THIS IS SOOOOOOOOOOOO COOL I WANT ANOTHER ONE ITS CHEAP TO.I THINK ITS REVOLUTIONIZING THE WORLD AND ESPECIALLY ME JUST LIKE AMAZON.COM IS ALL THE TIME.I LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONG FOR ANOTHER OR A NEW XBOX GAME CALLED METAL ARMS GLITCH IN THE SYSTEM.
1,Not insanely funny - not a comedy,"The single sentence description of this movie is way off target: ""...director Ron Howard's insanely funny comedy...""I believe the person who wrote this description hadn't seen the movie, but was basing their text on what they thought the movie would be like, based on the cast.It's not a comedy and it's not a good drama either."
1,Torture,"Let me start by stating that I love Kevin James and wanted to rent a comedy, which generally Kevin James provides lots of laughs (Grown Ups for example). What I got was almost two hours of misery. This movie is horrible. There isn't one funny line in this movie minus ""lady wood"" which didn't even translate to funny but just creepy.After two hours of this guy debating on telling his best friend or girlfriend about ""the dilemma"" it suddenly is wrapped up quickly and without any kind of ending. Nothing is resolved it just ends. There are great actors in this movie and all should have dodged this script!"
1,Zit-ent,"I couldn't eject this popporn fast enough. Howard has lost it. I had a feeling like you get when a centipede craws across your arm.........no, that is stimulating as well as creepy.This schlock is just creepy. It's more like drinking sewer water accidentally (not that I've done that recently). Actually, now that I think about it, it's more like toxic sludge that gets dumped on your soul. If you like TV this one's for you. ""Hilarious"" my bottom."
2,Not Funny,"I thought it would be a funny fun movie, but instead I got an angry movie that even makes the viewer feel unconfortable. My personal opinion is that they could have gone many different ways to make this movie funny, but didn't. If a friend has this movie, watch it (even thoguh I doubt they would watch it a second time). If you can't watch this movie for free, then dont waste your time or money."
2,Boring,"Not too much to write about this. This was a pretty boring movie.The trailer, as well as the categorization here on Amazon of ""comedy"" makes you think, well, that this will be a comedy. It really is not. Sure, there are moment where the actors are trying to throw in comedy, but, this is more of a drama. The main drama plot is okay, but, the deal with the engine is really technicaly lame.I'd wait for the price to get to $1 or $2 bucks (or go to Red Box) before I'd recommend someone watching this."
3,Pretty good movie.,"Nothing groundbreaking with this movie, but $5 for my iPad mini. Two of my favorite actors so I figured why not?"
2,It should have been better...,"this is on directv now and i was looking forward to seeing it. thought it would be funny. for the most part it wasn't. in fact it was quite depressing.i liked the fact that it showed a serious guy friendship and vv really had a true dilemma but the fact that the cuckolded husband was never held to account for his little trips to the massage parlour and that it contributed to her having an affair was really disappointing.kablooey! all the sudden that fat toad didn't love his wife anymore and didn't bother to TRY and save his marriage.not a happy ending(no pun intended), not a funny film."
3,Not a comedy but still ok,"The reason why I gave this movie 3 stars is because it's not what it advertises to be. I was in the mood for good comedy and based on the trailer, this was supposed to be one. Plus, Vince Vaughn & Kevin James, it had to be funny, right? No. There were a couple moments where I laughed out loud but the rest of the movie seemed more like a drama. 2 best friends in business together, one happily married and the other in a serious relationship but won't take the plunge. One friend witnesses the other friend's wife cheating and the rest of the movie is primarily based around whether to tell or not to tell. The story was a good one, acting was great with a talented lineup of actors, and I enjoyed the movie. But I wanted a comedy & was left disappointed."
1,Sad,"Sadly, I found myself wondering if I had lost my ability to sense humor during this showing. The cheater's schemes seemed too real to life, more depressing than funny, and Channing was so much better than the rest of the cast that, by comparison, it made watching the rest of the predictable and boring movie more like agony than humor."
3,Love Vince Vaughn!,"I am Vince Vaughn's biggest fan. This movie is funny and entertaining. After awhile in the movie, you just wanted to say...""alllllright...enough already"" It did get old and needed more material in the plot."
2,Such a Boring Dribble,"This movie is such a let down. I love Kevin James and Vince Vaughn and with the talented Ron Howard as the director you would wonder how this mess ever happened. I don't think I laughed at all throughout the entire movie,...and I *think* it's supposed to be a sort of dry comedy right? I couldn't tell if they were trying way too hard or just lazy with this flick. The characters chatter on for what seems forever, especially Vince Vaughn. I found myself daydreaming after about a minute into each of his long drawn out chat sessions (sort of like the annoying friend who never shuts up.) I think the writer of this film failed miserably when it could have been an adorable little comedic gem. Don't waste your time, unless however, you'd like something to help put you right to sleep."
3,Much Too Long!,"This could have been a much better film because it had a great cast. Vince Vaughn and Kevin James have a history of great comedy. Winona Ryder, who sadly we don't see very much anymore still is a talented actress. Jennifer Connolly was just plain wasted in this movie as she played Vaughn's love interest. The story of a guy who accidentally observes his buddy's wife in a compromising position was a good story line only it didn't really go anywhere and the constant scenes of trying to put things right were way too unrealistic and unbelievable! The screenwriters didn't come through in this flick! Too bad! It could've been a good movie with a lot of lessons learned and by the way, where was the comedy? I didn't find anything funny about this movie."
2,*SQUISH* Just Like Grape,"There's a scene inThe Karate Kidin which Pat Morita talks to Ralph Macchio about walking on the road; walk on either side, you're okay, but if you walk in the middle, you're going to get squished just like a grape. This movie is that grape.If it was trying to be funny, it wasn't and if it was trying to be dramatic, it wasn't. It seemed to be trying to do both and ended up failing at both. Bit of advice to the writer, paraphrased fromDead Again: find out which one you want it to be and make it that way."
2,Fight the temptation,"This movie is just all over the place and fails to pull off any of the tangents and come together and cohere into anything intelligible. Script writers and directors should hopefully try and at least follow one formula instead of trying to combine seven different formulas and pull none of them off. Cliche and poorly executed, resist the temptation and avoid this."
2,"Silly, wacky, pointless flick","I was more than generous in giving this ""movie"" 2 stars. I don't know why I continue to watch movies with these two main characters in it. They are always disapointing pieces of fluff. I did watch the whole movie which is why it got two stars,generally i would have turned it off half way through. The guys in this movies were made to look like idiots, and the womenbigger idiots."
1,Just to add another 2 cents...,"Not a comedy, not a drama, not interesting. 2 hours of boring silliness, and bad silliness at that. The whole character-tries-to-tell-someone-something-but-gets-cut-off by-the-other-person bit goes back to the 30s, and even then it wasn't all that swallowable."
2,not sure what to say,"It started off ok but then it got so boring and not going anywhere. I couldn't keep watching. How does it end, people? :)"
3,Better Vaughn than usual,"I really liked the early performances/characters of Vince Vaughn before Dodgeball and Couples Retreat etc. This movie taps into a little of that old Vince Vaughn, but not enough to make this a very funny movie. There were some funny moments, but a lot of this movie just seemed to drag."
3,Good Comedy Drama,"If you're in the market for a bizarre drama drama, look no further. Vince Vaughn in full stride with the ever calm and innocent Kevin James. Winona Rider and Jennifer Connelly play their partners and the four of them add up to a subtle, funny, touching drama on Friendship and its tribulations."
1,A COMEDY?,A real boring movie a comedy what a joke. Don't waste your money i sold my dvd the same day i bought it .Since Vince Vaughn was in the movie i thought it would be a good movie WRONG. Is this the best that Hollywood has to offer?
3,Better Than I Thought,This movie was better than I thought it would be.I'm not a big fan of Vince Vaugh but I liked him in this movie and Kevin James played the loveable nice guy.I thought it worked as a comedy/drama.I thought the acting was good and I liked the characters.Sure it could've been funnier and it ran a little to long but it is alot better than most movies I've seen lately.If your a Vince Vaugh or Kevin James fan or if your looking for something different than most of these movies Hollywood is churning out than you should see this.Better than alot of the comedies or dramas these days.
4,It was entertaining,"It was entertaining. Not the most hilarious movie I've ever seen, but I enjoyed it - which surprised me. I really like Vince Vaughn and Kevin James...."
2,Boring,"My boyfriend and I rented this movie the other night out of sheer boredom, boy, was that a mistake! There were maybe two scenes that made us laugh, the rest of the movie we yawned and just commented on how boring the movie is. I personally didn't like any of the characters, and the only one I felt some sympathy toward was Jennifer Connelly's. Queen Latifah had few lines and I think she was the funniest character in this movie. I am not a professional movie reviewer, but I would not recommend this movie to anyone unless you are planning to be bored."
3,COMEDY TITLE IS MISLEADING! 2 1/2 STARS!,"I'm glad I read the reviews before watching this drama because from the cover of the DVD which state this film is ""Hilarious""? I would have been disappointed. The film has a very depressing premise and tries to make some fun out a very touchy situation. James and Vaughn are excellent and both show they're up to playing more than a couple of goofballs. The problem here is we're so used to seeing them play goofballs that we keep waiting for them to do something......well, goofy!I did enjoy this flawed film, but probably wouldn't give it a second viewing. If you're looking to laugh a lot this film isn't going to cut it(although there are a few moments of fun), but if you like the actors and troubled romance films, then this one is worth a look."
1,Couldn't Finish It,The story line is depressing. There's just no humor in cheating or deliberating on how to break the news to a friend. And Vince Vaughn just really. isn't. funny. We turned it off after the disasterous toast about honesty. I have no idea how the movies ends. It wasn't interesting or entertaining enough to even care.
1,Indentity Crisis...,"When I was watching this film, I was recalling my own dilemma I experienced being friends with someone in high school who cheated on every girlfriend he had. The girls were nice enough, and thankfully the day never came when they jammed me in a corner to ask the important questions.After the film was done, it took a while for that old feeling to go away. My stomach was churning, and I wondered what I would have done in a similar situation.I thought I signed up to watch a comedy, but instead I viewed something that was mean-spirited and made me feel uncomfortable. Don't let the previews lead you to believe this is the Vaughn from SWINGERS or James from KING OF QUEENS. Everyone involved, from Queen Latifah to Ron Howard, are underutilized.The infrequent times when it tries to be funny are actually mildly amusing, but such as FUNNY PEOPLE, it doesn't know what it wants to accomplish.If the goal was to confuse and aggravate the viewing audience, then mission accomplished."
2,Not even a comedy,"There are some funny Vaughn lines. Other than that, skip it. Kevin James was a dissapointment. At least Jennifer Connoly is as beautiful as ever."
3,Not as bad as the many 1 star reviews would indicate,"I'm very surprised at the abundance of 1-star reviews on here. While this movie was no great shakes, it wasn't a stinker or a bomb by ANY means. It certainly had entertainment value, kept my attention, and I had a few hearty laughs throughout. If you read my reviews, you see that I'm actually a pretty harsh critic when it comes to movies, but this movie really wasn't ALL that bad!Yes, Vince Vaughn is a completely one dimensional actor. He virtually plays the same exact character in every movie. No need to beat that drum over and over again. You know what to expect out of Mr. Vaughn. I thought Kevin James delivered a decent performance in the co-lead role. Again, this movie isn't anything to write home about, but it certainly wasn't a 1 or 2 star flick."
2,"Okay, not good enough for Ron Howard","This story is just okay and not nearly up to the caliber of Ron Howard when he is at his best. Then again, he directed the painfully dull Dan Brown novel turned film whose name I can't even remember because it was so bad.I like the actors here too, but they needed and deserved much better material."
1,Ugh!,"This movie was terrible. I had high hopes because of the cast, but it turns out to be false hope. This movie was predictable and the characters were more frustrating rather than enjoyable. PLEASE don't waste your time or money! I don't need to say anything else, but I definitely expected more from this movie."
2,"not funny, awkwardly serious",pretty big miss here. few good rants for vaughn and not enuff outlandish behavior for james. the script is pretty much a total mess and the concept never gets off the ground and the supposed comedy often gets grounded by awkward and uncomfortable dramatic moments. I want my $2.94 rental money back!
1,baaaad!,"wow, this was the worst movie i have seen in years! how did this get released. does anybody proof these things? i threw the dvd away after breaking it in two just to make sure i did'nt watch it again! awful! it does'nt even rate anything."
2,THE GAME,This is a really bad game. I think Lego made it just to put the word Bionicle on a game. Many times the camera angles are bad and the auto aim really sucks. It is simply not fun. In many missions they just have the Toah running around collecting items for a pointless reason. And the controls are very bad. There is nothing for anyone here. Please ndon't buy this game.
2,kinda sucks,this game kinda sucks.its fun at times but also REALLY challenging at times. i got this game and i played it for awile and really didnt get anywhere. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME UNLESS YOU REALLY LIKE BIONICLE AND CANT LIVE WITH OUT THIS GAME!
2,Too easy for my 10-year-old,"Great graphics, but my 10-year-old beat it in three hours. That's not much fun for a $40 game."
1,I totaly agree with Dash Hofman!,"(I do have Enter the Matrix by the way and it rocks)This game was a huge HUGE HUGE HUGE dissapointment, I expected better of Bionicle. I've been a Bionicle fan from the begining, and I an severly dissapointed in this game. WARNING, DO NOT BUY,but rent it and see what I mean."
3,Great but too short - rent it,I am a huge Bionicle fan and have been waiting forever for this game to be released. I finally got it on Friday night and by Saturday afternoon I had finished it. There are only 6 levels and one easy boss level. I could have just rented it and saved the $40 for another game. The game play was great and the graphics were excellent. I really liked the racing levels. But lengthwise the game did not live up to my expectations. Its not that I'm great with games either. I haven't finished even half of all my other games. I'm disappointed because I was really looking forward to it and now it's finished already.
1,You're better off standing....Not a good a value,I purchased this product for our shower and to say I was disappointed would be an understatement.For $50 you would expect this item to be of a higher quality than it actually is. The various tube sections do not fit together well and the generic hardware pieces make it difficult to assemble. I didn't feel confident in the construction of the item and the wood seat was poorly pre-assembled and an enormous amount of wood filler was used to fill in the gaps.I still gave it a shot and found that after several uses the tubes fill up with a tremendous amount of water and when it is moved release a nice black color that stains your shower or tub. It also wasn't very stable in our shower.I wound up returning this item to Target and received a refund for the item and not the shipping.If I had paid $10 - $15 for this item I may not have been as disappointed but would have still returned it..Please look elsewhere for a higher quality product.
1,Terrible Bench,"Looks good but it stops there. After just a few weeks the coating that the covers the teak chips on and water gets under. The wood is not blac (mold?) Looks ugly, nothing to do but throw it out."
2,There are better shower seats than this,"There are plenty of problems with this to give it a low score. First of all it looks silver in the picture which is what I wanted. The description does not mention color which is stupid. It actually is white which doesn't match my bath decor. Secondly it is a royal pain to assemble - and I am a mechanic. Third, after only a month there is already rust showing on the legs. In short, do yourself a favor - spend the extra $20 and get one of the better models."
1,Shower Stool,So far I have not put this stool together. I built a hamper with a pull-out compartment with less trouble than I'm having with this stool. The directions are almost impossible to understand and there are no holes in the top to connect to the base. I'm at the point that I'm going to have to find someone to put it together.
2,Installer for Mac simply doesn't work,"By far the worst software installation I have ever experienced. There is no way that this product went through any kind of quality assurance--it simply does not install. Fortunately, by the fifth attempt, I looked at the Amazon.com comments for this product and found the steps for hand copying files that a previous reviewer provided (thank you!).Once installed, I found the product to be a satisfactory, basic introduction to French. I think that it is worth the price, at least, once you get it installed."
3,For when you can't sleep...,"This book does contain wonderful written accounts of clothing--clothing that I happen to know does NOT appear in pictures (the written descriptions, therefor, are the only evidence of their existence). It's furthered my knowledge of cotehardie decoration/embellishment in particular.But, my God!, this woman is BORING! I still don't know how someone could manage to take a topic I'm dead-interested in (I make 14th century clothing for myself and my husband) and bore me to tears with it. I haven't read more than about a fourth of the book.Some history scholars should hire ghost writers. Just because you can research with the best of them doesn't mean you can write a book that anyone else can read.Oh, and she's one of those uppity history scholars who doesn't bother to translate anything out of middle French or Latin. I'm so sorry I don't speak three languages like you do!Good material, dreadful presentation."
3,fashion in the age of the black prince,i would just like to say that i was extremely dissapointed with this book due to the lack of illustrations especially colour illustrations of which thier were virtually none. id have to say that i was decieved by the books lovely cover page.
3,disappointing...,"i tried out nba live 2004 cause of the updated rosters, jerseys and additions of Ming, Lebron James and Carmelo, but honestly, the game isn't or wasn't worth it. the game is so boring and dry, it's unbelievable. there is no crowd like there is in NHL 2k5, the music is boring and crapy, and the animations get real old real quickly.gameplay is hard. i hate that the defense is like a brick wall. you can't even drive in half the time because even the point guard can man up against you. offensive rebounding is hard and at times, bench players or guys who wouldn't normally do good all of a sudden are dropping 20 a game on you.i was honestly disappointed with Live 2004. the NBA Lives from Sega had more character than Live 2004."
3,Has up's and down's,"This game is pretty good. I am only renting it, though. There, are a few things I don't really like. First, the rating like stink, they gave LeBron like a 60,and Richard Jefferson a 67. Second, you miss to many easy shots (like layups). The graphics are fair, and the game is fun."
5,best basketball game out there!!,"NBA Live 2004 is so much better than last years version. It has better graphics and the crowd is a lot better. You feel like your really in the game! This game is a lot better than espn basketball, trust me."
4,"Great game, could be better","I skipped the 03 version of the game so EA could get their act together and while this isn't the best I think they could have done it is definately a big step in the right direction.My biggest problem with this game is certain plays, such as the post up move becomes almost a guaranteed 2 points every time once you realize how to fake out the computer, this holds true even on the higher level..Realistic game play and full control over the team and GM duties from start to finish make this game well worth it however some changes are needed for the 05 version."
3,not real simply a video game,"This is simply a video game there is nothing real about it.It is extremely easy to block shots.the computer is always faster then you, on fast brakes the computer catches up and pushes you altering your shot making you miss. But when you push them they make it.The positives are its very quick leading to fast breaks. Very fun when playing humans and if your arent a basketball purist it is fun most of the time. Game plays quick and smooth controls easy to master. If played on hardest level the game is some what of a challenge depending on the team you play and the talent on that team.so i rate it a 3 out of 5"
2,It's OK.......Can Be ALOT better!,"NBA Live 2004. A pretty good game. This is the second year i have purchased Live (2003,2004). I always had the 2k series. Live has a pretty good dynasty mode but, theres room for improvement. On Live you cant see whos got higher votes for the Rookie award. Also in dynasty mode you dont get people wanting to trade with you. You have to pursue them and they normally turn down your trade. The graphics are poor during gameplay and the game speed is crazy fast! It needs to be more realistic like ESPN Basketball. Also what is up with Ben Wallace's hair?!?! It looks like a pineapple and it never goes to cornrows like he wears alot. I HIGHLY recommend ESPN Basketball ove NBA Live 2004."
1,You called this Basketball?,"More like deflated ghettoball. This game lacks in afro's, and the roof is not being raised. This games sucks, NBA Jam is much, much better."
4,NIce step,"Last years game was a vast improvement over the one before it , this one takes it a bit higher .It has D. No more just the unrealisticdunkathone D is tough they actually bang.they don't even do in the real David Stern NBA. Great game great graphics and good move to dump the play by guys and get Merv and the Czar."
3,Cult Movie,"This is a movie for the hard core SF fan. It has a strong Heavy Metal feel to it. While some claim it steals ideas from Star Wars, there's one major scene which Phantom Menace seems to have stolen from it. There are also some elements of this story similar to Titan AE.It's enjoyable enough, especially when one has seen practially every animated or SF movie from the period, but one should not expect too much from it. This was not a big film when it came out but it has aged well. One must also remember this film didn't have a big name behind it and it isn't bad for a novice film."
5,A story of the triumph of love over lust,"This is one of the most quietly beautiful books I have ever read. Set in Chicago and the mysterious world of the Indiana Dunes on the southern shore of Lake Michigan, Rogers evokes the feeling of two very different landscapes with seamless prose as he tells what will undoubtedly become one of the classic American coming-of-age novels. I appreciated the maturity of this book, which tells the story of a young boy who lusts after every girl he meets while longing, deep down, for a more profound and lasting relationship."
4,One of Zoot's best.,"Zoot Sims never made a bad album, but he did make a great number that were merely very good. This one, however, is excellent. Sims, Peterson, and Pass all solo beautifully, and the bass and drum team of Mraz and Tate are behind them every step of the way. The two standout tracks are 'I Got Rhythm', where Sims follows an explosive Peterson solo with full-throated honks and excursions into his beautiful upper register; and 'Embraceable You', when Zoot proves that only Webster, Getz, and Hawkins can challenge him for beauty of tone. That said, there isn't a bad track on this CD, and it will give any Zoot fan -- any jazz fan -- a great deal of pleasure."
2,How's the picture quality?,"This is a pretty barebones DVD, but it is Widescreen... so is the picture quality good?"
2,6 million dollar man meets Mexican Village People,"I must be so far outside the age demographics for this movie that I'm willing to give 2 stars. My head says that it's a 1 star flick but I weakened and gave 2. There are some decent actors in this movie, but they are giving 2 dimentional performances as they sleep-walk through what passes for the plot. The action was just OK, the fight scenes (the reason I watched the movie) were poorly done. Special effects were not so special. Van Peebles is a much better actor than what he showed here. OK, he was playing a robot, but Arnold set the standard for android actors and Mario, handcuffed by the script, looks like he walked out of a 1950's SciFi B movie.If you can watch the movie on TV for free, give it a look. If you can remember the Nixon Impeachment, you may bail after the first 30 minutes.I doubt there will be a Solo 2 but given the ending, the producer left the door open so consider yourself warned!"
1,A one star rating on this movie is too much of a compliment,"This movie is nothing but a boring, unthrilling waiste of money. It's like an eclipse, people, it's dangerous to look at it directly."
4,Solo,"Solo is the perfect soldier. He is a master of combat in all its forms. He has no family. No friends. No birth certificate. No Social Security number. No medical benefits. If he is severly wounded, he will be abandoned by his commanders. No one will cry if Solo is gone. Who, after all, would shed a tear for a killing machine? Which is exactly what Solo is, the very best money can buy. Everything from the action to the acting makes this movie well worth it. Humor plays a huge role in this movie also."
3,Decent Sci-Fi action flick,"Solo, staring Mario Van Peebles, is not a classic. Solo, the film, reminds of Predator, another sci-fi action film staring good-ole Arnold, with the jungle setting and the army running around killing people. In fact Predator isn't much better, but that's another review. If you're ever bored, ya know, on a Sunday afternoon, like me, check this movie out. The writing is mediocre, Mario Van Peebles turns in a decent performance, the action is light, and the jungle setting looks really nice."
1,gods and goddesses of ancient egypt,"My disapointment came when I was mislead by the company because I was decieved. The book supposedly was illustrated to be a level higher than it was. I assumed this book was an adult reading and not a child's info-study. Because the book cost only $6 I will not ask for a refund; however, in the future I believe there should be better communications between the customer and the supplier. Thank You for your time and I hope in the future that we will be able to work better together so I will have a mutual agreement and purchase more Egyptian itmes. Thank You."
2,Chipped through stainless steel,"I bought this in 2009 and used only during holidays and large gatherings, less than a dozen times in the last 3 years. This last month I noticed a chip through the interior stainless steel at the inside base of the roaster. Very disappointing particularly for the price purchased. It is a nice looking roaster, but it appears, not sturdy enough for the work. I no longer want to use it."
5,Sort of a sequel to How to Read Your Opponents Cards,"Start with Mike Lawrences ""How to Read Your Opponents Cards"". Get comfortable with the concepts he presents. Then try this. The book presents a set of chapters each featuring a common combination, such as KJx.The reader will need to place cards based on the defenders bidding (or lack of it), and whats been played (and wahts not been played).The book really is about deduction and counting, not how to play a suit to maximize the number of tricks. Don't let that stop you from buying and reading it, its well worth the time and money."
3,Not what you might expect,"The title of this book misleads. One gets the idea that this book will attempt to show players the best a priori plays of the dozens (hundreds?) of key card combinations in bridge. Instead, we receive an in-depth analysis of 7 specific situations. Admittedly, most of these combinations will arise frequently, and Lawrence analyzes them effectively and thoroughly in various contexts. However, I was hoping to see a method to analyze generic combinations at the table quickly, one that would have use in more than only a few specific situations.Great analysis by Lawrence, a la ""Play Bridge with Mike Lawrence"", but not what I was looking for in a book with this title."
2,Nice...but,"Her eponymous debut is a favourite of mine. Clear, restrained, intimate and lyrical. I'm afraid, for me, ""The Embrace"" succumbs to the dreaded New Age cliches that make me the opposite of chill. Her piano is still as lovely as ever, but the production overpolishes, and verges dangerously on the muzak. Alas."
1,NOT WORTH THE WAIT OR MONEY,AFTER ALL THE WAITING THE LAST EPISODE JUST FALLS FLAT. THE ART AND STORY BOTH DO NOT MATCH THE QUALITY OF THE FIRST TWO VOLUMES. IF YOU CAN RENT IT OR BORROW IT FROM A FRIEND SAVE YOUR MONEY. I WISH I HAD.
4,A Classic in Thinking about Race,"When Coon's work was first published, racists claimed it justified their thinking about white superiority. The bigots didn't understand Coon's arguments, but his idea of multiple orgins of race has not held up. DNA analysis and other research techniques show that humans did originate in Africa (as Darwin guessed), spread out from that continent, and through natural selection, mutation, and genetic drift became the 'racial' populations that exist today.I recommend the book for historians of race; it is important in the evolution of thinking about race.ernestschusky.com"
2,NOT AS PLEASING AS EXPECTED,"FINALLY SSX3!!! Those were my words when I recieved the game for my bday this last october, I was and still am A HUGE fan of SSX Tricky which is definately on my top 5 games ever made, but when I played SSX3 I immediatly was dissapointed its on a Mountain! 1 measley mountain, SSX tricky was fun for having numerous levels with dif styles of locations like a wicked techno Tokyo track or the awesome City track, but in SSX3 its mostly all snow trax and more white mountains and more and o wait theres a pine tree! The game also lacks some seriously awesome characters u can only play if u get there cheat and play them under another character's profile. If you have never played The SSX tricky game this will be a blast but compared to SSx Tricky this game needed more time........."
5,Great,"Firstoff I was addicted to SSX Tricky. I love the SSX series. But, in this game it seems like the producers and stuff tried to be a little more....serious. They brought back some of the most boring characters from SSX Tricky like Moby, Elise and Zoe. So i'm kinda depending on the new characters to make it more fun. (Mac and Karoi are my favorites though...hehheh)Seeiah, Eddie & Marisol would have livened it up a little more but w/e. I love how the new game is set up with the GIANT mountain. I can not wait until i purchase this game. (No i haven't bought it yet...)No matter what i will always love this series and it game seems EXCELLENT w/ all of the graphics and tricks. I HAVE TO BUY IT AND YOU DO TOO!!!"
5,..........yes!!!!,"This game is great. If you enjoyed the first two SSX games, this will not dissapoint. This game is HUGE. Some of the courses are 20 minutes and longer - that's not to say there aren't short courses. There is an entire half-pipe as one run. So cool that the SSX designers expanded on the level-design.In fact, it seems like they took every aspect of SSX Tricky and bumped it up a notch. This is a fully-thought out, true sequel to the SSX series. I'm getting antsy just writing about it. I want to get out of work so I can go home and play! I don't think any snowboarding game is going to come close to the fun factor SSX3 delivers for quite some time."
5,Best game I have,"This is a really fun game. There are lots of things to do on it, like Half Pipe, Racing, and freestyle. There are a lot of different courses to go on, and when you've finished peak one, you go on to peak two, and then peak three. It's not too easy, and it isn't so hard that you get frustrated and don't want to play it anymore. The controls aren't hard to remember, like in some games. I would definately buy this game again, and it is great for most ages."
2,Not That Good,"I thought this game was going to be just like SSx Tricky, but I was wrong. I loved ssx Trickey levels, but ssx trickey levels are not that great. If you want a good snowboarding game then get SSx trickey not ssx 3."
5,Give It A Chance,"I bought Need For Speed Underground, Resident Evil Code Veronica X, and SSX 3 Out Of Bounds. I tried them all out and loved all of them except SSX 3 Out Of Bounds. So I decided to try it again and played it for about an hour and decided this is the best damn snowboarding game period. I showed all my friends and they said the same thing this is my favorite snowboarding game. It is easy to understand after an hour and the controls were always easy. SSX Tricky was the best snowboarding game and now this which adds another 7000 new things which makes this new addition the best damn snowboarding game because Stone Cold said so!!!. I reccomend this game if you like or don't like snowboarding games. It truly is the best."
5,SSX 3,"The people at EA did a great job on this game.It has better graphics than the first two SSX games,some of the controls are better, it has more clothes and junk and it has better tracks.It has the best soundtrack of any game I've played. Probablythe best snowboarding game ever."
3,Ok Game,I thought this was very fun game but I think the graphics could be like mario kart Double dash
1,The Description is Not Necessarily the Product,"My wife is a big fan of Phil ""the Power"" Taylor, perhaps the best darts player in the world. He is featured on the cover of the cd and in the video. So when the product description stated that this item included the video, I ordered it as a gift. Unfortunately, the video does not appear to be there. So Phil Taylor fans are probably better off going through amazon.uk and getting the DVD from there. I have not yet listened to the music, but at least the cover is great."
3,a good collection of short articles on creativity,"This book is actually a collection of short articles on creative thinking by several authors. Although Edward de Bono's, Peter Drucker's and Tom Peters' names were mentioned on the cover, they didn't contribute any articles except for some of their quotations. I find Deana Berg's article alone on the power of reframing is worth the cost of the book. She introduces ten possible and well-illustrated ways to reframe your mind to more options and creative ideas. I have always believed that reframing - or changing and multiple perceptions, to paraphrase Edward de Bono - is the key to creativity. The recommended readings and resources at the end of the book, are real gems if you are a first-time reader into the field of creativity."
3,watch for delivery costs and confirm,"The book is in good shape. It was the delivery cost that was a problem. It was advertised as a special with free delivery, but I was charged a delivery fee equaling the cost of the book. I also received no response to my inquiries about this."
4,So much help...,This book has been so helpful in my auditioning process. THANK YOU FOR PUBLISHING THIS!!
3,To much like a search engine,"First off, let me say that if you are a young woman in high school this is certainly worth your time reading, because that is basically who this book was written for. For the most part, this book does give the reader the basics of what engineering offers, but I think the book would have been more effective and entertaining if she either tried to limit her topics or increased the length of the book. I find that most of the book starts off interesting, gives you a vague glimpse and then spends the next 130 pages telling you where to go if you want to know anything about the topic, I thought that was the whole purpose of buying this book in the first place. In my opinion, this book is like Raymond Landis' "" Studying Engineering""( a book I did enjoy), without the depth. If you're looking for a book that's written with junior high-schoolers in mind, this book will give them a starting point with which to explore their interest in engineering."
5,"A must for those trying to figure out a career, and fun, too!","This book is a classic. I've been aware of it for years and have given out hundreds of copies to students as prizes. I am very excited to hear a new edition is coming out soon. This is one of those books that needs to get in front of high school students. Most have no idea what an engineer is, and after reading this book, they will not only have a clear understanding but will likely be inspired."
5,Very Funny Book,"I can only shake my head in admiration of Mr. Burnett's adventures. It must have been fun to get up every morning just to see what was going to happen that day!I read ""The Hat"" on the train and noticed people in my immediate area were looking around to find a) the person that was laughing so hard and b) decide if they should be concerned about some looney popping a gasket on the train.Definately a book worth reading."
5,"Funny, Evocative . . . Did I say Funny?","Dan Burnett has penned some of the funniest stories I've ever read. Don't start this book if you don't have time to read the whole thing, because you won't want to put it down.Mr. Burnett reminisces about his rodeo days--footloose and fancy free. A teensy bit intoxicated on occasion. And that's just what this book is: intoxicating. I bought copies for my brother, my sister, my kids, my friends--and they all loved this book.Don't miss out on some of the best Americana of the 20th Century!"
3,Not for real Opera lovers,"The introduction of this video is:""My favorite opera"", which clarify itself that it would not be a complete performance. And true, this video is a combination of biography of how she became an opera singer, told by the singer itself, Barbara Hendricks and a description of the personification of Norina, the main female role in the story which was told lengthily followed by several extracts of the music or arias in the rehearsals as well as of the performance itself. Albeit Don Pasquale is not the most popular opera of Donizetti,however watching and listening to this video, it is rather a disappointment for real opera lovers only to be able to watch and listen to only parts of the divine and melodious music which is also sung excellently and brilliantly by Barbara Hendricks and al. We would then wonder when a complete performance of this opera will be available in video, as we are convinced that Barbara Hendricks made this performance so witty, brilliant and maervellous."
3,A Possible Disappointment,"I should have read the one previous review before I ordered this. I also did not notice that the running time is only 60 minutes. As the lady who wrote the initial review said, it is just an interview of Barbara Hendricks discussing her performance. I have yet to view it, so I can't yet comment on the quality of the performances of her and her co-performers."
3,"Works well, but no better than the 18v","A little background - I have virtually all the 18v tools that DeWalt has made, including two 18v hammer drills. I have built numerous houses with their tools, and done countless remodeling projects. You could say I'm a fan!That said, the 36v hammer drill really hasn't impressed me. It is huge, so it doesn't fit in some spaces where the 18v will fit, and the power doesn't seem to be that much better. On the rare occasion that I need something more powerful than the 18v drill, I'm probably reaching for my Milwaukee wrist-wreaker (corded) or a 2"" roto-hammer.I really like the 36v line, and am impressed by the circular saw and recip saw. This drill just seems like a tool without a need. It rarely leaves my shop to go on a job, and I never use it at home either. It was part of a combo promotional kit, so I can't complain about the price, but I don't think I'd buy it outright."
4,A very good drill for that occasional need.,I am a HVAC professional and in my work there are many different drill needs on each job. I love the makita 18volt impact drill for the small screws on the furnaces and A/C units. I am a Dewalt fan and have the 18 volt combo kit as well. I bought the 36volt and use it exclusively for drilling anchor holes in brick and block. I also use it for paddlebit drilling of holes for pulling wire thru the joists in basements and attics. It has plenty of torque and the power lasts a long time. I highly recommend it to anyone that needs a powerful drill without the cord. The only negative I have with the drill is that it sometimes slips out of drill/hammer setting and has to be adjusted.
4,very strong drill,I bought this with a reciprocal saw on sale for 60% off and I have been rather impressed. The chuck never slips (as cheaper drills do) and the battery lasts for weeks. My only complaints are that the battery seems to suddenly run out of power with little warning (there is no gauge as competitors have) and it is quite heavy.
5,Great tool = Happy husband,"I bought this DEWALT as a gift a year ago for my husband because we needed to replace our old non-cordless drill. Needless to say he was very happy. I'm however am practically minded and researched several drill/screwdriver brand options and combinations. This was the best quality product for our overall house repair and hobby uses. It is well worth it to spend the money and get a DEWALT like this one, it will last you for years to come, which is not something you can say all that often anymore. We use our DEWALT on a constant basis! Get it!"
1,i thought this was supposed to be about wine,"this dvd has more to do with castles and tourist attractions than wine. i am studying wine, and they listed few grapes, few names, few places. i have learned more about french wine and grapes, and areas, and harvesting, climate, etc. from wine for dummies (the basic wine for dummies) than anything i saw in the 15 minutes i watched this dvd. if u are interested in seeing castles and learning about what kind of birds inhabit the wine growing areas of france, then this dvd is for u. if u are a serious student of wine, don't waste your time."
1,Just watched this DVD and.....,"What a disappointment. This DVD is little more than a sight seeing tour of France. Nice towns and inn's but not much more. Oh sure they stop and drink a little wine every night but not much more. If you were expecting to see your favorite Chateau or vineyard, forget it. There is nothing to do with actual wine making other than a small section on Bordeaux. Big waste of $27.00...."
4,Exploring french wine region,"I was looking for a full descriptif of each French region as well as good info on wine , that DVD did the job perfectly .Good quality image and adequate comments."
5,Peerless Pocock,"This book deserves a hymn more than a review: the Appendices that follow the Commentary on this seemingly minor speech contain the most probing, erudite, and insightful account of late Republican politics available anywhere. Written before the Syme-Gruen orthodox offered us an English-speaking variant of the Mommsen school's anti Ciceronianism, Pocock's book represents the last stand of light and sanity. Among too many wonders, the most amazing revelation is the role of Crassus. By demonstrating his systematic assault on the *concordia ordinum*, Pocock discovers a way to make Cicero live again."
3,Journey to the Far Side of the Sun,"Beware! A few of the reviews before me have told just a little too much about this movies plot. This movie deserves it's surprise factor to remain secret. A good Sci-Fi movie not supplemented with --too many-- special effects. This is more story line/plot rather than a great dependance upon visual effects to pull it through. Some of the rocket scenes are admiringly model-ish. You will grin when you see them. I viewed it last month and will probably view it again next month. A great twist included therein and a surprise & mournful ending. ---(will ANYONE believe his story?), JIM"
3,Like a 'Night Gallery' Episode with decent effects.,"There's some decent sci-fi metaphysics, but nothing that approaches the best Outer Limits episodes or even something like ""The Terminator."" Even for a camp / cult film there's just not a lot here to hang on to. It goes without saying that the characters are totally dull and lifeless. But the screenwriters did not even begin to explore the wonderful possibilities of their material. All in all, not very memorable. But, I'd snatch it up before it disappears again if this is your type of thing. Great sets and the feel is just perfectly 1969."
3,Good idea but,The idea of the movie to have 2 earths opposite-+ is good in a way.But the scenario is a little weekCan watch but it is not the best of Roy thinnes
2,Not as good with age.,I saw this when I was a youngin and I thought it was really cool. Now that I am older I didn't like it as much.
4,Journey To The Far Side Of The Sun,"I first saw this movie in Nha Trang, South Vietnam in 1969. The movie was out in the states and Vietnam at the same time. At the time it was one of the best Sci-Fi movies that I had seen. The special effects were ahead of their time. However, the modeling was a bit obvious. The storyline was very good. The prospects of there could be another earth out of the view of the real earth. We know better now because we have mapped the sun and if there was another planet like earth we would know it. Great movie!"
3,Wonderful cheese,"Wonderful cheesy fun!When I was a kid, the 1930s Buck Rogers movies were great adeventure fun. Today, this 1969 movie has all the same kind of appeal: Star Trek kinds of effects, opticals I associate with the 1970s, really bad science. (Please notice, I was closer to Buck Rogers then than I am to 'Journey' now.)If you have fond memories of the Twilight Zone, the weirdness will appeal. Not worth hunting down, but fun.-- wiredweird"
3,NEAT LITTLE SCI-FI THRILLER,"I would rate this project higher if it starred bigger names and better talent. I've seen better Dinner Theatre actors - in fact, I'm one of them. This project involves the discovery of a new planet that resembles Earth. NASA dispatches a team to investigate. What they find is something more like anti-Earth. And, like in CONTACT, upon returning to Earth, nobody believes them. But something is wrong - Earth is a little different from when they left. The differences are small but odd: familiar trappings like furniture, hairstyles, light switches, ... are slightly different, or moved a little bit. Creepy at times. The ending would make Rod Serling smile, and make you happy you watched. NOTE: the NASA stuff looks more modern than todays NASA stuff. No small acheivement for a 30yo film. Perfect fare for snowy afternoons (like todays)."
2,"Talky, Techie, Tedious","This opus from the very talented special effects workshop of the Andersons gets off to a good start. The premise is interesting-a duplicate Earth on the other side of the Sun. The effects, done with models and opticals,(pre CGI era) are amazing, particularly the launch pad sequences. Unfortunately, it falls into the same old rut as most British SF-too much chit-chatty talking, too much time spent on machinery close ups, and spiritless acting. A pity that a portion of the time spent on close ups of punch cards, flashing lights and countdowns wasn't reserved for plot development. The story just falls apart at the end. The ending, which I won't spoil, is not a clever plot twist, it is just inane. If you turn it off after the ship lands on the ""other"" Earth, you've missed absolutely nothing. Not nearly as much fun, or as digestible, as UFO or Space 1999."
3,"3.5, really...","A good, but slow-moving, fatalistic sci-fi thriller from 1969... sort of a pop culture Rosetta Stone between ""Star Trek"" and ""The Six Million Dollar Man,"" wherein a hidden, doppelganger Earth threatens our own, and all the space-racing might of the our species can do nothing to prevent the inevitable. Slightly strained, but worth checking out."
3,About time,"Took long enough to get the re-release. Good movie, but certainly far from great. It's predictable, slow moving, with no real special effects, but it is reasonably well done and certainly worth a few watches. Roy Thinnes is in fine form, and the plot although very predictable is still interesting enough to keep you watching it all the way through. Certainly a worthwhile addition to a sci fi collection at the sale price of $13.99. I wouldn't bother paying more than that though."
2,Its popularity most likely will fade with time,"This is one film that will probably only be enjoyed by the most ardent sci-fi film fan. By today's standards, the props, special effects and cinematography look so cheap and crude. Also, this film could have benefitted from a better screenwriter; just about anyone who watches this will be left ""hanging"" at the conclusion."
2,"In the future, everyone will drive Corvettes","For obsessive SF collectors only. How anyone could compare the quality of the special effects to 2001 is beyond me. Ridiculous plot, wretched acting, and myopic vision of future technology makes for great ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"" material. This movie would have been more aptly titled ""Journey to the Far Side of Uranus."""
2,JOURNEY TO THE FAST SIDE OF THE SUN,"Did anyone else notice it takes 3 weeks to get to the planet on the other side of the sun. That's 93 mil miles x 2.Took 3 days to the moon, 1/4 mil miles. So, say a mil miles is 10 days, roughly; plus there are variables like Sun's grav.10 x 93 = 930 days, or say, about 3 years.... x 2.6 years.That's some super rocket.Also, good thing on the other Earth they didn't speak English backwards like they wrote it, hahe. They would have, logically speaking.And can someone explain why when he tried to return to Earth, he could not dock as the craft pushed him away? What repulsive rationale was that? Must have been so that he could re-enter and crash into the rocket to make a big explosion finale (they were new then)."
4,Journey the farside of entertainment,"Journey to the Farside of the Sun is a classic of British sci-fi. I saw this as a kid and I loved it, I saw it again as an adult and thought it had all the wonderful touches, lots of lovingly built and filmed models, mediocre plot stiff characters, that a good B movie needs.This is Gerry Anderson pre-Space: 1999 showing off a bunch of great special effect (pre-CGI) and they are great!!It is not the best movie in the universe, but if you are a fan of old sci-fi, this is a must for the collection."
4,"Great, serious and ultimately groovy sci-fi....","This is one of the more serious 60's sci-fi with a great premise and nice twist to it. While some of the model work is a bit cheesy, some of it is downright excellent!! Well worth checking out.Too bad the DVD is bare bones, but I guess this means I don't have to upgrade from my bootleg DVD which also has pristine picture and includes a menu, chapter selection, a movie poster gallery and the original trailer. Shame on you Universal......"
3,"Selby's done better, but it's not a waste of time","I would suggest you read about every other Selby book before you choose this one, but on it's own, it's still decent. It reminded me of George Carlin in one of his nihilistic rants. Sure it rambles like hell, but if you skip a little here and there, it's pretty entertaining and funny."
2,Interesting twist,"I have to admit, I was pulled into the plot by the hook - a guy wants to buy a gun to kill himself, but because of the waiting period, he ends up deciding to kill other people as well.While there's more to the story than that simple one line, the writing is so labored it makes it hard to get through the novel. I have heard good things about Selby's writing (Last Exit to Brooklyn) but I now believe I should have started there. This was a turn off..."
3,Not his best work.,I have read plenty from the author and this was good but it shows more of the insanity of the main character than anything else. I love Selby and his works but this book could have been better in my opinion.
4,Excellent for lay leadership development,John Cobb has written an accessible and powerful book that will close the divide between the laity and seminary educated clergy. We all need to be critical theologians -- applying our core Christian beliefs and values to our churches and the world around us. I would recommend this book as a small group study guide for developing and enriching lay leaders in a progressive Christian Church.
2,Only Good For Beginers,"This book has some good tips for people who are brand new to the pageant world. But, if you have already competed or at least have some knowledge about pageants, this book is not for you."
3,Common Sense,"Initially I was very excited to have ordered this book as my daughter is about to enter her third pageant. The expectation was to find information that would add to her future experiences as a contestant. The book had many things that would've been appropriate for a young girl, perhaps a preteen. Most of the material was, in my opinion, common sense and hopefully taught by a parent as a contestant enters puberty. One exception was learning to use the ""walking sticks"" to improve posture. I thought that was ingenious. Learning to sit correctly was obsolete in my daughter's experience, since her interviews are done standing behind a podium. In that case, good stance would be an appropriate topic. I would've appreciated more helpful ""nuggets"" to help polish the performance of an older teen contestant, as my daughter is sixteen. To reiterate, a very helpful resource for a preteen upon entering pageants."
5,Good Music,"Nosleep has some heaterz on this cd Ghetto Icon, if you never heard of this dude you need to check it out cuz Nosleep is one of the best up and coming names in music."
5,WOW!!,"This CD will blow you away, their sound is hard to describe trying to match with their own originality and bands from the past, but let's face it, they are their own people and well they have their own sound and that is an incredible one. Buy this if you haven't, go out to see them and you could be looking at the next big stars, so make sure you get those autographs."
3,Xenophon's Anabasis,"I read this book after Herodotus and before Thucydides. I had heard about Anabasis from reading A History of Histories. The book has military lessons still taught by instructors at West Point.I think there might be several translations of Anabasis, and this one was a little hard to follow, perhaps because it adhered to the original ancient documents which have survived. I think I would have liked a cleaner narrative with footnotes (if any) at the end of the text, or at least the chapter (""book"").You will want to find appropriate maps when you read this edition (which has none). The 10,000 travel from Iraq thru Turkish Armenia to the Black Sea, and then visit many ancient ports and cities, back and forth. If an edition is available with such maps, I recommend it over this one."
4,brilliant story,"It's a brilliant story, an epic hard to be found in other forms of literature throughout the world. Enjoyable, readable.On a secondary note, I noticed the references to the absence of a movie. I'm writing a screenplay for this book, I'm an amateur writer in my free time and apart from poetry, fiction and short stories I'm interested in making screenplays from a few famous Classical stories. One of these is the battle of Marathon and the Anabasis itself. If you're interested my email is keltic_chi@yahoo.frBack to the story itself, I believe it's one of the few classical books that can be read by anyone, even if you're not particularly interested in the ancient world.Jan"
4,Movie of Anabasis,"While I have not yet read Anabasis, I intend to, and will revise this review when I have. However, there IS a filmed version of Anabasis. Walter Hill's 1979 `The Warriors' uses Anabasis as its basis. Heh...be warned, its not the Greeks and the Persians, but it IS enjoyable."
4,The Real Deal!,I confess that I have heard of this classic for years and never made an attempt to read it until recently. It is a classic because it has stood the test of time. It is an outstanding account of the Greek Mercinaries who fought with Cyris in the 5th century BC. Although it reads much differently than a novel it is much more fascinating when you know that the words are written by the man who really participated in this epic adventure and survived to tell his story. I highly reccomend it to anyone who is interested in classsical warfare of just likes a good adventure story of men enduring extreme hardship and winning the battle in the end. You will not be disappointed.
4,A Slower Pace,"Herb Alpert and the TJB are known for bright little instrumental pieces, heavy on the brass and often with a latin flavor to them. For the most part, this album fits in with that vision but there is something different about it as well. It seems to be a bit slower paced and more contemplative. The melodies are still beautiful and some are indeed fast or playful but the overall mood is a slower one. That being said, this album is still a source of joy and forms a pleasant background to my day."
4,"Very precise, easy to read, easy to use.","The first thing that made me want to read the book, other than the title, was that is was unbelievably short. After reading it, I was impressed with how much the information made sense and how easy it would be to try. I have a low class this year and decided to give the Whole to Part theory a chance. I was very impressed to see my students making connections after only one week. Many of my students do not speak Englis as a first language so I wasn't sure how well this would work. My students are enjoying learning to read this way and feel very successful, even my special education students. I will be using this information for a long time to come. Many teachers I work with have seen my success and are interested in reading this book and trying it for themselves.Thanks, Marilyn V."
1,It's a piece of JUNK!,"I purchased several of these at Home Depot, which are actually made by Melnor. I kept returning them for replacements as they consistantly failed to do their job. They leaked, water got into the battery compartment, and then they're shot. I will NEVER purchase another Melnor product again."
4,An enlightening journey,"This book was a wonderful, humorous read. I have previously read other books on the 4 personality types and this was an additional help. I even discovered that my spouse was a different type than I had previously believed. It makes his personality more understable."
5,Leave on the Limeliters!,This is Truly the Best of the Limelighters! No longer available on cd! EXTREMELY RARE! Even though its their best it is not on cd! Great listening music! Strike up the Band!
3,nice recording but still incomplete,"This recording of Newman's beautiful soundtrack to The Song of Bernadette"" is good as far as it goes, but the very soft chorale background music of the nuns singing in the distance, when Gladys Cooper is lecturing Bernadette about her doubts etc. and also in the final death scene of Bernadette, are still noticably absent. To me, these are the loveliest most spiritual moments in the whole movie. Were they ever recorded on some other version of the soundtrack before? I would have given this 2 record set a 5 star rating if these were on it. Buyer beware. Bo Biffa"
5,CURTAIN UP ON A THEATRICAL GEM!!,"The curtain has just gone up on perhaps the most historically significant collection of theater music. This disc contains the newly-discovered, very-first-ever recordings of tunes from ""Hello, Dolly!,"" ""How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying"" and ""Gigi""---tunes we all know and love, though no one has ever heard of the singer, a woman named Rose Marie Jun who, between 1957 and 1963, was paid for [every] track to cut these ""demos."" (It was a way to convince famous singers to record them on their own, before the shows actually opened. It was called smart marketing.) It worked; the 21 songs here have been recorded nearly 100 times by such stars as Louis Armstrong, Stevie Wonder, Perry Como and Bing Crosby. This is Volume I of a planned six-CD set. We'd start applauding, but we're too busy pushing the ""repeat"" button."
1,Pay money for a disc you cant use,***WARNING*** false advertisment. I thought I was purchasing the collection with all three discs and I refered to the product photos showing a box set with three discs. Was very dissapointed to receive just a third disc with add on levels you cant play without Duke 3d. Why would someone buy just a third disc they cant use without the other discs to play? Guess I will just bust out some more cash and buy Duke 3d.
2,Watch out... you could be missing a few things!,"I was not happy when I noticed only disks 1 and 3 were sent to me. Nothing else. Its pretty rediculous if you ask me to not get the collection when the description says ""COLLECTION""."
4,Pretty Good Collection,"It's great to see Vulture in figure form and the Lizard and Rhino are vastly improved from their earlier, less poseable counterparts. The only downside is the Carnage. This figure was already released separately. Sure, it's a new paint job, but a classic spidey villain like Shocker or Chameleon or Kingpin would have been better. Alas, maybe they'll be in the next collection. Will they ever make a Prowler figure? That'd be cool, right?"
1,Vinyl on CD,"Although it's great to see all of these songs together in a somewhat comprehensive package (except for Pal Joey's 'Hot Music' which has nothing to do with the 80's theme since it's a 90's Acid jazz track).The main glaring problem with this collection is that it's mostly culled from VINYL recordings, featuring pops and crackles on just about all the songs on this CD.These are NOT digital masters of the recordings, just someone putting their very used record collection on CD.I'm shocked that a company of Rhino's stature would release something of this poor quality.Who's sleeping on the job over at quality control there? Or was that position eliminated?.Avoid this CD unless you just really want to hear the tunes, no matter what the quality. Great idea, bad execution (a lot of that going around these days).And to the schelps over at Rhino; you're on notice."
3,Smells like fish food,This stuff smells awful... I'm still taking it. I'm not taking it as often as suggested though so I'm not getting the full benefits of the Spirulina.I have to hold my breathe when I take these though... it's an awful fishy/fish food smell... there is no taste going down though.
3,Blue Green Algae Amazingness,"This superfood was the only thing that has stopped my persistent eye twitching.Highly recommended; I take this daily, as I do red marine algae.I don't remember the last time I was sick.Try it!"
2,Absolutely disgusting stinche,"I cannot and will not ever take these supplements. Just opening the cap off of the bottle made me gag and nearly throw up. They reak so bad of rotten fish that I threw them out. Such a shame, since Spirulina has such great benefits. Wish I had known that before I bought them :( Oh well."
3,first time,"This is my first time taking this product. From what I've read in my research, it's very good."
2,Dull,"I recently ordered prints of Vincent van Gogh's ""Starry Night"" and ""Starry Night over the Rhone,"" and was very disappointed. I love the pieces for their vibrant colors (especially the way the big, bright stars stand out against the brilliant shades of blue).Sadly, the posters I received were very dull and drab. The vivid colors were muted, and the stark white stars were light gray. I threw both posters away, rather even than give them to a friend. (What kind of a gift would that be?) It was a sad waste of money and paper -- and a poor representation of two of my favorite paintings.I see now that both posters' prices have been knocked down to hardly anything. They're still not worth it."
3,Eh...,"It isn't quite what I was expecting. The colors are a bit dull and faded, not vibrant like I was expecting. Some parts are almost blurry and out-of-focus. But, for only a couple dollars, I can't complain too much. I'd only give quality 2 stars, but I give it another due to the low price. If you are looking at getting a print of the painting, I suggest spending more elsewhere for a better quality."
5,perfect for office decoration,"I bought this along with a poster of The Cafe Terrace for decoration at my workplace. (both were purchased from Art.com seller on Amazon).as with this one, it is beautiful and the poster shows the colors and detail in good accordance.but note: because the orginal artwork is bigger than the standard poster size, a little bit at the top is cut off. (but unless you are a devoted fan of Van Gogh, no one will notice).will most likely buy from this seller again one day."
2,Mediocre quality of the print,"I expected this poster to look better. A very low price should have been the sign that something was wrong. Unfortunately, the resolution is definitely below my expectation and the poster looks good only for far. When you approach it, the bad quality of print is easily noticeable. If they don't have a resolution high enough, they shouldn't print it in such a big size."
3,"Good, not great. Dull colors",The colors simply don't seem to pop quite as much as my colleague's Starry Night posterVincent Van Gogh (The Starry Night) Art Print Poster - 36x24. Not sure why. Colors simply not as rich as shown in the thumbnail. Buy from someone else if you want to be amazed every single time you see it.
2,No me gusto,"En realidad Este cd no me llama la atencion. Parese que a los artistas en este cd se le fue todo el talento... o algo asi. Puede ser culpa del productor. Dj Blass hizo algunos ritmos, pero en realidad no se que le paso a el tambien porque ha hecho mucho mas mejor. A esto le doy dos estrellas solo por el hecho de tratar. Luny Tunes y Noriega en Mas Flow siguen ensima de la competencia.Este cd es muy caro"
3,"Music ok, disc defective","Disc 1 of this set will not play to completion on some players. It stops near the end of the last movement of Quartet No. 3.I love the artistry of this group and think they bring out Brahms' intentions beautifully. It's hard to enjoy it, though, when you know your enjoyment will be brought up short."
2,not wht avartised,this is still cool but you only get 4 volumes not the full 7 i recmend if u realy want the complete colletion go to best buy and buy it for the $100
1,What?,"I was under the impression that this was the entire series. I finally, after many issues, got my set and unwrapped it, and my heart sank audibly when I saw ""Complete Collection I"". I popped the last disk in and lo and behold, it wasn't the full series afterall."
1,AMAZON = FAIL,"i placed this order on 8/29/10. every week i'd get an email, saying that the delivery date has been postponed a week. i'd have to go approve the change in delivery date every week or the order would be canceled.two complaints.1. what's taking so long? this five month delay is ridiculous and unacceptable.2. why do i have to keep approving the delay in delivery? the default should be that the order stays, and i may opt out. instead, i've had to approve a change of delivery date every week for five months. this is preposterous.i've called amazon several times and each time a foreign accented person would read from the same script, without doing anything tangible to help.i'd give amazon 0 stars if that were possible.AMAZON = FAIL.***** EDIT *****i just got off the phone with the fifth amazon rep in five months. she gave me a $25 promotional credit for my troubles, told me to cancel the order, and place a new order. we'll see if that helps."
4,honkytonk bluegrass and more,"Even without the famous, ruefully hilarious, Nashville-baiting title song, Murder on Music Row would be an exceptional excursion into countrified bluegrass. It is alleged that George Jones once considered a career in bluegrass, and in some ways Larry Cordle tells us what the Possum might have sounded like if he had. My idea of hillbilly heaven would incorporate a honkytonk with Jones's version of Cordle and Leslie Winn Satcher's ""Jesus and Bartenders"" (""Jesus and bartenders/ Hear it all"") on the jukebox. In the meantime, Cordle's own version will do nicely. First-rate songs and hard-driving yet tuneful instrumentals -- all in all, a reminder of just how good good bluegrass can be."
5,murder on music row,"shades of brisco darling . this cd should be in every blueegrass fans cabinet. the ky boys have really learned how to play like they do in tn. can't say enough about the picking on this cd, from the raging fiddle to the smoking mandolin and irish tones on the guitar. i'm sure they are all using black diamond strings."
4,"Vampire Mooose (yes, with three o's)","My brother just gave me a vampire mooose cd today and I am impressed!! This cd is solid, brutal metal with an almost melodic touch. Theres no filler songs. This is another cd where you just listen all the way through. Every track has its own unique touch like a different lyrical approch (a little FYI...if morgan landers from kittie was a guy he would sound like the vocalist from Vampire Mooose), a different style (track 1 has a tribal feel to it with the tom intro and track 8 almost has a latin touch and track 9 sounds like it would be featured on a sonic the hedgehog game.) This is a very talented band that shows a wide diversity of sound and excellent song writing skills. Its a shame not many people know about Vampire Mooose. But YOU know about them now and you need to buy this cd!!Best Song: Spiderman Vs. VenomOne Word Review: unique"
2,falls apart easily,"The house came apart within a few minutes of opening it. Also it folds as if you could take it along anywhere...which was why I primarily bought it, but all the pieces and dora figure fall right out of either the door or the opening above, so if carried by my child, we would loose the pieces right away. If you aren't going to take it anywhere, it may be worth it, but I am disappointed in it."
2,Not worth 18 bucks!,"My almost 3yr old daughter got this set last week for Christmas...and while I did not expect high quality, this thing is a piece of JUNK!!! The drop down back will not stay in place at all, if my daughter so much as shifts the structure a inch it comes out of its peg slots...and as for taking it anywhere, forget it, the thing dosent stay closed and even if it did the figures are small enough to fall right out the openings...For the price of almost $20, I expected a bit more...my review wouldn't have been so negative if the price had been a much more reasonable $5 which is about all this set is worth..."
1,you wont like it,"About the "" Victor PH-500 Pencil Holder with LCD Display, Condition: New"" : There is no icon for alarm on/off on the display. I'm pretty sure it has had the icon for it, but I doesn't show on the display. The numbers for month are also gone. It looks like a malproduction or a used pencil holder. Overall, I'm not satisfied with this deal. however, I'm not gonna take time sending it back to them."
1,Should have known better....,"I bought this despite the bad reviews because it was exactly what I needed. I thought I'd take my chances. Right out of the box, I noticed what appeared to be a smudge in the lower corner of the display which, upon closer inspection, turned out to be a portion of the ""liquid"" from the LED display pooled in the corner. It disappeared when I set the clock and placed it on my desk. A few minutes later I noticed that the date and time had reset to the factory original (1/1/1999 12:00). So I set it again, placed it on my desk and proceeded to place my markers in the cup holder. After a few minutes the info for the date, time and temperature disappeared, leaving only the headings on the display (MONTH, DATE, DAY) and the thermometer icon. I tried everything--pushing all of the buttons, taking the battery out, replacing the battery--NOTHING! I'm too aggravated to return it and will just add it to the list of things I had to learn the hard."
1,Lasts about 1 month,"What a cheap product. It worked fine until yesterday when I heard a snap while retracting it. After that, the tape would not retract any further. When I shook it, a small piece of black plastic came out. Don't waste your money on this product."
3,Very enjoyable with most of the BOND music you'd want.,This is similar but more comprehensive than another BOND collection on one CD by the City of Prague Philharmonic. These are good renditions but clearly not the orginals. I must ask if the Prague Philharmonic does not own a harp? It is glaringly missing in the Goldfinger themes and i am sure on others. That harp is an exciting and beautiful touch to the wonderful GOLDFINGER theme and its absents is unfortuneatly very noticeable. Also some of the other themes can even sound muzaky if thats a word(elevator music)It gets 3 solid stars good collection yet defineatly something is lacking.
3,Good book,"I liked the overall theme of the book of getting on the path, and enjoying the process without obsessing on the end result."
3,Mastery,"After the excellent 'Way of Aikido' I found 'Mastery' to be a bit of a let down. It didn't seem very coherent and took a whole book to say what could have been expressed in an article or essay. Considering this is based on an article the author wrote you can see why this would be. The ideas aren't especially original or new and if you've read other management or martial arts books then these ideas will have been expressed before and often in a clearer way. My advice would be to buy and read 'Way of Aikido' which is great, but you can miss this and not be too worried.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."
1,"Study, Work and then Study some more","This book is all about the art of working hard and then working even harder. If you don't know the meaning of work, then this book will spell it out for you. Life is all about spending the time to practice and working hard. Do you need a book to tell you that?"
5,"For Tennis, For Life","A wonderful book. I especially like what he has to say about being on a path. To paraphrase, if for every mile you travel the road becomes two miles longer, you are most fortunate. Ties in well with the ""Ten Thousand Hour Rule"" that Malcolm Gladwell writes about. Joel Herskowitz, Co-Author of ""Swallow Safely: How Swallowing Problems Threaten the Elderly and Others. A Caregiver's Guide To Recognition, Treatment, and Prevention"" and ""The DOUBLE Talking HELIX Blues."""
5,Mastery and Superperformance,"From studying mastery in business I can attest to the same pattern George describes in Mastery. Superperforming organizations become masters through discovering the Seabiscuit inside and letting him run. Mozart's quote captures it and to my mind, characterizes the coming transformation economy, ""Neither a lofty degree of intelligence nor imagination nor both together go to the making of genius. Love, love, love, that is the soul of genius.""Also readSuperperformance"
5,Homeostasis...Biology class right?,"Great book! I found a lot of interesting concepts in here including the concept of homeostasis (forgot about that one from Biology!), how the body eventually will automatically always return to its original state as a way of protecting itself and how that also applies to the mind. The topic of practice and muscle memory and why you need to practice over and over before your muscle memory kicks in to do a particular task before it becomes second nature. And the discussion on how America has become a society of immediate gratification, without the benefit of practice, commitment and mastery, the values that are lost in this lifestyle. The author discusses learning to love the practice and finding peace and satisfaction in your daily life."
4,A Simple Book on Patience,"This book hints that you need to be patient in order to master things. Nothing groundbreaking, but a good read as the book brings up some points worth paying attention to. You can read the entire book in one toilet session -- that's a plus.-KiSalem Beats"
5,"An Absolute Must Read For Any Professional, Musician, Artist, Athlete ...","Mastery breaks down the mystery of people who seem to have supernatural talent and endless energy. Leonard explains why so few people ultimately excel in their craft, and that ' mastery ' of anything is but an illusion. Think of public figures who never cease to stop learning and improving even if they are viewed as top of their game - Betsy Johnson, Jack Nicholson, prominent doctors, etc.I am an avid yogi/gymnast/dancer; I love all forms of physical activity. This book parallels it's ' lessons ' through physical practices, but extends to all facets of life."
5,A Life of Meaning,"I read this book as required reading for a college course called ""The Life of Meaning"". Basically a class on determining your calling. I thoroughly enjoyed this book as it very clearly laid out what it is to be a Master and called me out on those things I have only dabbled in. I highly recommend this book to those who are looking to understand what it is to be a Master on their journey."
4,Master of Mastery,"The title of Leonard's book should have been Mastering instead of Mastery. This fun, easy, fast reading book offers up intersting proverbs, great warnings of common pitfalls, what it means to aspire to mastery, and perhaps most importantly a guide to achieving the state of mastery (or the process of mastering). Although it sounds very ""new age"" this book is more a study of what it takes to succeed complete with potentially helpful tools than some spiritualism of the week trend. Overall - An inspiring read filled with insight and excellent suggestions for acieving long term goals and fullfillment."
5,The Path to Mastery makes life more rewarding,"First, you need to figure out your dharma. What do you love doing most? Then do it, and then read this book, Mastery. Being on the path no matter what you are doing is richly rewarding. Leonard explains how in easy to understand terms. It is another contribution from the East, put in western terms by the Master, George Leonard. George was at least a 6 degree black belt in Aikido when he passed a few years ago."
5,Love this Book,I will buy this Book again if it gets destoryed. George Leonard is a true Master in his own right!
2,Tedious and Trivial Trivia,"This book possesses all the narrative charm and warmth of a PowerPoint presentation. Unreadable, unfocused and often ungrammatical, this tedious collection of the most trivial of trivialities is recommended only for truly hardcore Wingnuts."
4,Great CD with re-recordings.,"Very nice cd with re-recordings by Skeeter of her most famous songs.Only problem i see is that the track list here is not right. This track list is from the digital MP3 download album which is also named ""The End of the World"".So now i'm a bit disappointed cause i was expecting all the songs that are listed here on the cd.This is the track list of the cd:1. The End of the World2. I Forgot More Than You'll Ever Know3. What Does It Take (To Keep A Man Like You Satisfied)4. (I Can't Help You), I'm Falling Too5. Set Him Free6. My Last Date (With You)7. Gonna Get Along Without You Now8. I'm A Lover Not A Fighter9. I Can't Stay Mad At You10.Am I That Easy To Forget"
5,Corman collection,"My husband likes this collection, he only wanted 1 of the movies but is enjoying all of them. It was a great price for the collection."
3,ROGER CORMAN COLLECTION,I ENJOYED THIS SET. A LOT OF STARS GOT THEIR START WITH CORMAN'S FILMS.THE STORIES WERE DATED BUT FUN TO SEE AGAIN.IF YOU'RE INTO ROGER CORMAN. IT'S A GASSSSSSSSS.
5,The Human Planet,"We always enjoy documentaries that cover topics to do with our world. We also love other documentaries regarding oceans, bird migration, evolution, meercats, space, mythology. We have not watched this dvd yet but it has been recommended to us by many people who are crazy for it. I know we'll love it too."
2,Human Planet disappointment,"This beautifully made movie was much more than I had expected. It certainly had the panoramic images I was looking forward to, but it also included a great deal of violence. I skipped though too many of the 80 stories to avoid the unnecessary violence. Okay, we all know animals kill other animals in persuit of dominence or for food. We know humans have always killed animals for a variety of reasons. But I am weary of the trend of permeating nature movies with a heavy dose of blood."
5,What a series!,I got this as a gift for my father (traditionally very hard to buy gifts for) and he loves it! This series is fascinating and beautifully captured. I recommend this and BBC's other series to everyone!
2,The sound track is broken in may places for the Blu-ray,"The picture quality is 5-star, but the sound tracks are broken in many places for the first two discs I have watched so far. The DTS-HD audio does sound terrific when it works. I checked the reviews and it looks like it is not just my problem. I have called Amazon, and I was told by the representative that he can not process the exchange until a week later (the system do not allow him to do it now).3/16/12 Amazon sent me the new Blu-Ray DVDs a while ago, I have a chance to play them lately. still same terrible sound track. I will keep the Discs, only for the pictures."
5,Breathtaking,"I am a huge fan of nature documentaries. Being a traveller myself and always longing to get to those hidden and raw parts of our world, this show allowed me to discover all over again how amazing, unpredictable and fascinating our planet can be and this time instead of watching mammals, birds, insects or plants we get to see people, living and surviving in the most unusual conditions.Camera work is stunning, John Hurt's voice soothing and stories fresh and sometimes shocking (hence rated 16). The bonus is last 10 minutes of every episode where crew is interviewed and all their hard work shown, it makes a great addition to the series."
4,Another good one by bbc,My family and I have enjoyed waching the other productions in this series and this one is just a good as the others.
5,you wont regret buying this.,you must watch this series. i don t usually leave reviews but i feel i have to this time. enjoy.
3,"More like, ""Arbitrary Planet""","I was very excited when this came out thinking that the ""human"" version of the traditionally kick-ass BBC productions would be my favorite. First of all, it doesn't live up to the production value of either Planet Earth or Life, two fantastic series. Moreover, the content is frivolous. I thought the premises of the vignettes would give fascinating insight into the human species, over-population, social and cultural impacts the planet; instead, it spotlights arbitrary stories of people who've found innovative ways to fish for food in unpredictable rivers and oceans and urban pigeon-taming experts. Somewhat interesting, yes, but such a teensy slice of human life. Perhaps some bigger picture stuff could have been added while the smaller stories would act as supplement. Disappointed!"
2,Animal cruelty?,"The images are splendid, of course, and you cannot help but marvel at BBC's technical achievement. Yet, somehow, as you travel through continents and environments, you soon start to expect a rather unpleasant pattern. At the beginning of each story, you find yourself wondering: 'OK, which animal are we going to kill this time, and in what clever way?' No, I'm not one of those animal-protecting nuts, I'm not a vegetarian, I'm not one to turn the blind eye to the killing that eating requires. But when you start dreading the next chapter because so many of them are painful to look at, you just have to wonder why you're watching this DVD. Honestly, weren't there other feats and achievements to focus on? The few stories that don't involve animal killing are so much more fascinating (fixing the mud mosque, crossing the Mekong on a rope, building amazing tree houses, tracking water under the desert, facing a frozen river to get to school...). That should have been the focus of the series."
3,beware of sound cut out,"This is a review about the sound quality only,the video is great.The sound in the jungle episode cuts out several times."
5,Love these documentaries!,Rented these on Netflix and enjoyed them so much that I purchased the dvd set. A must-see along with Planet Earth on Blu-ray.
5,A Must See Film,"Human Planet is one of my most favorite documentary films.For me, the film has both educational and entertaining values.Blue-ray pictures are awesome and the price is too cheap for its value.I like it much more than Planet Earth."
5,Beautiful & Interesting!,Saw the little snip of this on the internet and decided that I would like to see the whole set of DVDs. Have to say it is a very interesting with some great photography.
4,Interesting,"I enjoyed this video, but wish I could've seen more nature in it and less human stories. It's an interesting look at the human experience."
5,Great Documentary,Human Planet is probably my favorite documentary to date. It has stunning visuals and tells such compelling stories of human existence. Definitely a must watch!
4,Enjoyed it greatly,"Great imagery, stories, music.... Breathtaking sequence of imagesJust a little disappointed with the staging as shown at the end of each episode"
5,Eye opening and inspiring,"We normally don't watch too many documentaries, but this one was so intriguing that we just had to watch it. The cinematography was great, and the sheer variety of the different cultures causes one to pause and reflect on their own. We are now going to find and watch the rest of the BBC documentaries since this was so good."
5,Great product,"Fits well, easy to install, weathers the elements and enhances vehicle appearance. Order a set for my second vehicle and one as a gift. Thanks!!"
3,Well for everyone who knows accounting,"This is an auditing book for ones who know some accounting and want to learn basic and important aspects of auditing. Even this is not useful for introductory level, it can be still used for this purpose. Some of the examples are given from CPA firms and this makes the book efficient for later usage."
3,Interesting premise but...,"I was strolling in my local record store when I saw this album in with the soundtracks. The premise behind this album is that it is music inspired by the film, ""The Blair Witch Project"". The music is mostly electronic with some piano added. Most of the tracks are quite dark, as you would think they should be considering the film it is associated with. However, the music gets repetative quickly and interest in listening to the entire album will wane 1/2 way through. The opening track is quite good but the rest of the album lacks the mystery you would associate with a Blair Witch album. Recommended for Blair Witch fans who want to complete there collection of items. Not recommended for the casual listener who wants something new."
4,A personality sketch of Alexander the Great,"This edition combines great greek lives, but most will be buying it because of Alexander the Great. Originally intended to be published as one of his ""Parallel Lives"" series with Caesar, this short biography of Alexander is one of the three main sources used to derive what little information we have on Alexander. It is also the only history that survives that discusses his childhood. Not necessarily accurate, but Plutarch never claimed to be a historian. While not always successful, he does attempt to explain Alexander's complicated personality. A must read for Alexanderophiles."
5,This is a phenomenal book,"Missing Measures is a great book. Steele is a remarkable scholar. The book is well researched and written in a style that is easy to understand as well as being a very enjoyable book. It's of interest to anyone who enjoys poetry, formal or not. This is a great text in literary history/criticism. And it is important for those who want to understand the Modernist movement."
3,"Well-made and durable, but be careful","A well-meaning grandparent purchased this James for my son. The engine and tender are made of die-cast metal and the magnets can be used in both directions, unlike the wooden Thomas cars and engines. And therein lies the problem. All take along Thomas engines are NOT compatible with the popular Thomas wooden railway toys, meaning that this engine does not fit on the wooden track, and the wooden Thomas engines do not fit on track and playsets built for this James engine and his friends."
3,made where?,theese trains will hook up to made in usa take alongs by force of the magnet. however the magnet is a different shape and when they connect will not line up straight to remain on wooden tracks and always fall over.if using as an on the floor toy or take somewhere with ya toy then fine.
5,Pinto's Tales,"An excellant collection of short stories told in the cowboy way. Pat Schutz(Pinto) is a wonderfull spinner of ""windies"". When do we see Pinto's Tales 2?.Red Headed Stranger."
1,Don't work for a PS2 in a Sony Bravia Full HD,"I bought this component cable to play my PS2 (cause in the box said that it can be used to PS3 and PS2) in a Sony Bravia Full HD model KLV-40BX400. Unfortunately it didn't work because the picture appeared green. I wrote to Sony for some help and they responded ""Sorry but the PS2 don't work in LCD HD"". So now I have a useless cable. But if anyone knows how I can play PS2 to a Sony Bravia with component imputs Y PB PR I will be very thankful."
3,"Very good, but is difficult to conect and disconnected","Is very useful, but the only problem is that is very difficult to connect or disconnected, because every connector are made from metal and then slips. This is the only problem."
2,"good cable, bad design.","the cable works great, just to let all of you know. but the thing is the length you can spread the video cables from the audion cables is about 8 inches. if you have surround sound that is not running from your tv but another box then you are screwed because it doesnt reach far enough to plug into both. but if you dont have surround sound then i guess you should buy these."
1,ANGRY !,"Ive read on message boards that all ps2-ps3 AV output are the same along with their slim versions, but this cable doesnt fit in my PS3 Slim, i keep thinking should i force it? Risk my 2 month old PS3 slim by jamming the plug in? OR am i the unlucky one with a defected cable, the express shipping was like $10 too,,, now if i go call sony's customer support- id expect to pay for more shipping costs and time wasted to ship back for a refund which i dont even know if id get a shipping cost refund as well"
4,Works great with the Playstation 2,This product works very well with the Playstation 2 console. It's made the picture much crisper as compared to what it was with the composite cables! My only gripe is that the plugs are not very colourful (and thus hard to discern in low light) and are a bit difficult to insert.Make sure your television supports these cables before you buy them!
1,DOA,"I'm a techie and no matter what I did in the PS3 settings, this cable would not work. I bought it for analog gaming session captures. Unfortunately, by the time I discovered this, I had already tossed the packaging."
5,Great product,I bought these because the hdmi port on my ps3 went bad and sound kept cutting out. I got this and couldnt notice a difference in picture quality. Would rather use hdmi though.
5,sony ps3 component av cable,"Good price, good quality cables. I havent had any issues with this item compared to some of the reviews i read. I recommend it."
5,Just what I needed,"Just what I needed to use the component out connections on my PS3. I think because ""component technology"" has been around for a long time, many people aren't aware it's capable of 1080p resolution. This is what I use to capture video game play on my PC. I connect the component and optical audio out of my PS3 to theHauppauge Colossus PCI Express Internal HD-PVRcapture card in my PC. As long as your capture card supports 720p or 1080p, and the game your capturing is output in 720p or 1080p, you can record game play in HD using the component connections.Note: TheHauppauge Colossus PCI Express Internal HD-PVRcapture card supports up to 1080i, not 1080p. In my experience, capturing video game play is best done using progressive rather than interlaced. Therefore, I set mine to 720p when capturing games."
1,I got the lemon?,Ordered this cord from amazon and it only worked for about a week. Was playing NBA 2K12 and the sound went out. Reset the system and now the sound comes on but no video. Not the tv or PS3 because I tested with the old cord.
5,Great product!,"I had tried generic component cables with my PS2 and could not get any of them to work on my TV. I think it had something to do with the YPb(cb)Pr(cr) input on my tv and it's incompatibility with certain types of cables, or it was just faulty cables. I don't know. What I do know is that this cable worked like a charm. I have great picture for my PS2 to HDTV, and can finally play my ps2 games without wanting to scratch my eyes out.If people are having problems with getting certain component cables to work with their TV, definitely use this! Never had a problem installing it and I can finally play my games on my TV!"
3,S-video is better for a PS2,"I don't want to penalize it too bad because this cord is made primarily for a PS3. I got it for a PS2 though, because I saw it mentioned specifically that it will work with a PS2 and work well. I was disappointed. After comparing it with the S-video adapter I have for my PS2, there is no comparison. S-video looks better on the PS2. There is less color bleeding (none, practically). Fonts are sharper without making everything on the screen too blocky, giving the best of both worlds. With this component cord I was getting double-vision on a lot of things, and color bleeding. And if you're somebody who still plays some PS1 games on your PS2... forget about it. It looks terrible.If you're thinking about getting this cord for a PS2, don't do it. Buy an S-video adapter instead, trust me on this. And I tested this on both an HDTV and a flat CRT. Same results with both."
1,Not compatible with all PS2s,"I bought this cable so I can use my PS2 with my new HDTV. Unfortunately, the cable connection to the PS2 isn't even the correct one for my model PS2. I called Sony, and the rep looked up my model of PS2 and explained that this cable is not compatible with it. However, there is nowhere in the description or on the packaging that explains this. I've seen a couple other reviews like mine so I should have known better. I will say that the cables seem like awesome quality and would probably work well with the right system. I'd suggest calling Sony to make sure your PS2 is compatible with this if that's the system you plan on using it with. Hopefully Amazon will accept this return."
2,not the cable in the picture,"knnock off version dont buy its not sony! when i was buying this i thougth it was the official sony product, but what you really get is a cheap knock off version"
3,Excellent quality.,However it DOES NOT fit PS2 machines. At least not the one I have. Maybe the slim one?
5,PS3 component cables,"I have an old tube tv, with component input. I have conected this cables to my PS3, and you have no idea how improved the picture. Works perfectly and I STRONG recomend it."
5,Quality,"I bought a cheap no-name brand PS2 component cable, whose audio quit within a week.I replaced it with this so I can continue playing NFL2K5 until I die of old age, and it works great."
5,Great Piece of Equipment for my broken PS3,"About two years ago my PS3's HD output broke and I was unable to my HD cables. I decided to use my PS2 AV cable and have been using it since. However, it recently broke on me as well so I decided to find a replacement. Choose this one. Easy, affordable, and durable."
5,Its a Sony Cable,Its a cable so what more to I really need to say it works and that is that simply right.
4,Quality counts,"Originally purchased a discount component cable (sorry, don't remember the brand) at Best Buy rather than pay the Sony premium, but it didn't work out of the box. I had to put pressure on the connector to get full color to come through. The Sony cable is more expensive (online at Amazon cuts out most of the premium) but the manufacturing quality is higher."
5,Works perfectly,I guess a calbe should work or not work. Well this one works just fine and is has good quality cable and ends.
1,This should come with the PS3,"Isn't the point of blu-ray / PS3 high definition? This cable should come with the PS3 instead of the regular composite cable. That way, PS3 owners have the option of purchasing a composite cable if they desire a regular composite signal or an HDMI cable if they desire a higher-quality 1080P HD signal. I got my XBOX 360 nearly three years ago and it came with a component cable right out of the box, that way it was HD-ready from day one. I don't like having to purchase ""extra"" things that should be in the box, Sony. At least I got my PS3 for 25% off at Circuit City."
3,I found S-Video sharper than Video Component,"I have a non official S-Video cable for PS2 and for the PS3 I decided to buy the AV Component, even though it's good, the S-Video brings a sharper image, the official Component brings clearer fonts but a blurry image.This might be due to the PS2 besides the S-Video cable comes with an extra video cable (the yellow one) but this Component AV doesn't have the yellow video cable."
3,Horrible,The title speaks for itself. The output barely fits my PS3. I have to keep twitching them in order to receive picture and audio.
5,PS3 or PS2 Component AV cables,"Works as advertised - gets me up to 1080i output on my Playstation 2. Even though it says PS3 it does work on a PS2 just fine. GT4 and Tourist Trophy look awesome on my Sony 46"" LCD TV."
5,AV Component,This product worked excellent.It help me with the resolution in my standar TV.The colors and images of the PS3 are a lot better .... 100% recomended.
4,Pretty Good Cables,"Good cables for cheap HD option. Got mine about a year ago, worked fine for awhile, then a small problem occurred. The cable must have broke inside because occasionally if the cable moved too much, I lost audio and/or video and would have to move the cable around for awhile to get them back.The HD looks just as good as my MediaBridge HDMI and Sony HDMI do (my TV only outputs 1080i). Other than the problem that happened to me, its a great HDMI alternative cable at a reasonable price."
5,My kids love it,"My kids say: "" Oh yeah"". We love it Daddy. It fits well to port. We have no problem of getting a loose entry head."
3,a little old,this book is a little dated. Much more scientific research has been done since its publication. A few good points
2,A seemingly random series of inconsistent events,"This unusual fantasy novel started off well enough, with interesting characters, and some clever and cool sounding plot details. But it quickly degenerated into an almost random series of events in which the characters just didn't behave in a remotely believable way. So in the end, it was just dumb."
2,Nothing like the Harry Potter series.,"If you love the Harry Potter series, this is NOT the books for you. I was looking for a similar series, when I happened across this series. The reviews for the this book on Amazon, I now realize are misleading. Besides magic, this is totally different than the HP series. The chronicles of Chrestomanci is really a set of almost unrelated stories loosely connected by the person holding the chrestomanci title. I have read The first three books and two were utterly boring. I really only enjoyed charmed life. I was unable to ever get attached to any characters because they change from book to book. Also there seems to be no overall plot that connected each book. I thought that this was a poor comparison to Harry Potter, which is far beyond better than the Chronicles of Chrestomanci. If you are looking for a similar series to Harry Potter, look elsewhere."
3,Well...,"I don't know about you people, but don't you think Gwendolen is kinda bratty at the beginning of the book?Anyway, 3 stars because I have realized why this book was kept on my shelf for a year, unread and gathering dust. It is not as great as the other reviews claim them to be."
2,Huh?,This is rated 5 stars? This is one of the most boring books I've ever read. EVER!IAFAA. Inappropriate For All Ages.
5,She's Magic,The very best collection of Doris Day songs. It's about time that Sony Columbia started releasing more material. This collection shows how versatile Miss Day was. Great Ballads like the original recording of It's Magic - Big Band material like Sentimental Journey - Great show tunes like Doin' What Comes Naturally - Swing tunes like Shanghai - Great tunes from her films like April in Paris and Move Over Darling. One hundred per cent great listening. She is the best and she never sounds outdated.
3,Not quite what I was hoping for.,"I am a fan of Doris Day and recently saw her movie ""Calamity Jane"". I loved hearing her sing again, so I ran upstairs and ordered the CD. 90% or greater of the time, these reproduce CDs are great sound quality, this falls into the other 10%. The recordings are off slightly and I don't have that great an ear. They have a sort of muffled sound that adding volume to doesn't help. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, I really consider it a waste of money. This in no way reflects on the seller of the CD, they described the item accurately and shipped it quickly."
4,"Doris Day, Easy Listening.","I bought this CD from Borders. There are 2 CD's in this album, and contain Doris Day Hits from 1940 through 1970, incl. Lullably Of Broadway, A Guy Is A Guy, Pillow Talk, etc. I think that you will like it if you are a fan of Doris Day."
3,"Doris Day's Nice, but She's No Sarah Vaughan","I bought this collection because I read Sarah Vaughan liked Doris Day. Doris Day has a terrific voice. I didn't enjoy this compilation as much as I'd hoped, however. Some of the songs are a bit silly and dated. Even the better songs are inferior to other versions by Sarah Vaughan, Ella Fitzgerald, and Frank Sinatra. I like Doris Day fine, but if you like this I highly recommend Sarah Vaughan. If you're unsure about Doris, I recommend starting with a one CD compilation rather than two."
2,reminiscing with Doris Day,"I guess, I was trying to recapture some 'old feelings"" by listening to Doris Day singing her hits........I was a teenager and was a huge fan of Doris's in the 1950's. The music is dated...her voice isn't that great...I was prompted though, to get Calamity Jane from my library.....tried to introduce my grandchildren to this.....not interested, not enough action, bored with the singing....what a shame"
3,A Disc of the Historian,"What a wast for one of the greatest voices of the century. Who or What could have produced it? I adore oris ay, her voice, her acting and her movies. but this disc is not representative of the Doris Day of the 50]s and 60's. It is a history of her first ""bi band"" performances and then, the lesser know recordings made before she became America's Seetheart. Yes, ther are a few momentous songs(Lullaby of Broadway, Che Sera, Sera""nbut you have to listen to a batch of tripe to get to them Doris deserves a far better produced anthology; a collectionof songs that register her extraordinary talent. (Of course, this is just my opinion)"
1,Knitwits,"This is the worst book that I have ever read...ever!This book is about a boy named Charlie. One day, his ""mum"" tells him that she is pregnant. Charlie wants to get the baby a present. So instead of getting the baby something normal, like a rattle or whatever, Charlie decides to knit the baby a sweater. GASP! What if the kids on his hockey team find out??His next-door neighbor, Alice, finds out about his secret knitting and bets him $5 that he can't knit. If he can, he gets her skull collection. Yay. On top of all this drama, Charlie's mom is all ""OMG! I'm getting fat"" because she is/was a model. Oh, also his cat dies.Do not buy this book."
2,I was disappointed with this scooter cover,"I was disappointed with this scooter cover. I have a Honda Elite 110cc scooter. This cover doesn't fit it very well. But worse than that, the cover is kind of shapeless and it has no markings so it's hard to tell the front from the back. I won't use this cover every day like as I was planning to. I will probably only use it when I put the scooter away for the winter."
3,"Best Overnight Computer Bag Design, Defective Handle","I was looking forward to this bag soooo much after reading the reviews. Well, I received the bag yesterday and would have loved it if the handle functioned properly. The last stage of the telescope only worked some of the time. I tried WD40 but to no prevail. Good thing Amazon has a great return policy. I am re-evaluating an overnight computer bag choice."
3,Caution read before you buy!,"So I travel for work...a lot. This bag seemed to me to be the perfect answer after using the bacpack version for a while, which was killing my back. Yes i stuff it full, it's my office on the road. Now i've gone through three of these in just over a year(purchased and returned at an office supply store). The weakest part is the extendable handle, which i haven't had too much trouble with on this slightly newer model but quickly fell apart on my previous two. On my latest version the handle is still tough to extend but the seams are coming apart and the faux leather is ripping on the front. A good idea but poor materials and workmanship. Might do the trick if you don't live and work out of it but i would not reccomend for the serious road warrior."
2,"""Handle"" with care","Well, I have actually had this bag for 2 years. Over that time the handle has been a pain. Sometimes it extends and sometimes not. Try standing in the rain trying to battle a bag. The wheels also no longer turn properly. Finally a week ago the whole top portion of the handle snapped. It no longer is good for anything. I tried calling customer support. No luck. I would advise anyone out there against going through this. Stick with a smaller size of bag and obviously a different company."
4,Perfect!,"This was just the bag I needed for work. I used it as a carry on and kept a change of clothes in it just in case my luggage was lost (which they did!). It also holds numerous amounts of files and its nice to have a laptop bag for those quick excursions. All around, great bag. Well worth the money."
4,Good Purchase,This bag has plenty of space to hold all of your items. The best part is the second small bag for the laptop. Just take that bag onto the smaller commuter jets and check the larger bag.I would buy another one.
3,"Yep, broken handle.","I recieved this bag as a Christmas gift. Wenger replaced my bag under warranty. It's a lifetime warranty, so nobody is out of luck.These cases are expensive, so let's make Wenger put them right!My replacement bag isn't much better. I've found that if you snap the handle up quickly while holding the button, it sometimes will extend normally."
5,BEST WHEELED CASE EVER,"I checked out many cases in the stores. This is the only one I've, found that has all the space I needed, and all the features I wanted. The seperate laptop case (included) is a wonderful feature too. I'm in the insurance business, and use my case about 3-4 times a day. I'm very rough on my stuff, but this case shows no sign of wear and tear. I highly recommend this product to anyone, and by using Amazon.com, I saved about $50 bucks."
2,perfect computer bag ruined by cheap telescoping handle,"This bag has the perfect layout and assortment of partitions and compartments. The price was great IMO. BUT.....the telescoping handle doesn't stay up. You extend it, take a walk and the thing collapses as you walk along. The little spring-loaded buttons which are supposed to lock the sections don't hold - making it useless as a tote and too heavy as a briefcase. Too bad."
4,Well Organized Briefcase Holds All,Pros-- Holds everything one needs from home to office with space for more. The file compartment is sturdy and opens without tipping the entire case. The separate laptop case is handy for transporting it separately and storage inside the rolling case as well.Cons-- The expanding handle does not always snap into the full extended position with out several tries.
5,Laptop Case with Rollers,"Works very well.A 15 inch monitor in a 17 inch case provides extra carrying space for papers, etc.Wheels are very sturdy."
2,NOT in Stock DON'T bother to Order!!!!,"DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!!! IT's NOT IN STOCK!!!! Even though the seller RitzCamera is STILL selling this as ""In Stock"" it is NOT. It's very frustrating to spend the time searching for something online, finally order it and have your credit card charged, and then get a notice that it's in NOT EVEN IN STOCK and probably won't be for 30 days. WHY does Amazon allow this????"
2,Frustrated with Ritz,"After reviewing and searching on line and in retail stores ordered this case, I did not receive it when it was supposed to ship, called Ritz was told it would ship soon, later that day they sent an email out of stock. It took them 14 days to determine that. Now Amazon is recommending another vendor at an additional $10.00 price increase. I AM TOTALLY DISSATISFIED WITH THIS WHOLE TRANSACTION. Also try leaving negative feedback on the Ritz site just puts you in a big loop. This morning they finally listed this case as out of stock."
2,Beware: This is HUGE,"First of all, this computer bag is ENORMOUS! I could have used it for a weekend bag. Far too big for anything I'll need. Second, the vendor charged by $21 for shipping. So beware, what they lose on the cheaper price, they make up on shipping -- don't be fooled. Third, return process was such a hassle, it was almost cheaper for me just to keep this beast and use it as luggage rather than for work. Buyer beware."
4,Swiss Gear Patriot Computer Case,I love the case and it suits my needs very well. I am a road warrior and I carry a lot of documents and manual etc. The only thing I can say negative is that there is no optional shoulder strap. There are times that you just can't roll it and when that happens if you have the case loaded up it is not really manageable to carry it by the handle. I would definitely buy again and [...] was awesome
4,good,"So far so good,As the name suggest the swiss quality is promising.,My experience is limited to 5 trips a month. ..But I will definitely suggest them to my friends."
2,Swiss Gear rolling computer case,"The bag is self was very nice. Compartmentalized beautifully. The problem was the telescoping arm would not stay in the open position, kept closing up by itself. Plus the length of the arm/handle was not long enough for a 5'11"" person. I returned this bag and found another swiss gear style with 41"" handle/arm that works perfeclty."
3,"Great bag, TERRIBLE handle","I travel frequently for work (>80%) and I lug around a LOT of stuff, so I was very excited to find a bag that has enough space for all of my files, laptop and a change of clothes. However, I'm currently on my THIRD bag. Both of the first two I bought the handles completely fell apart on me - in the middle of a trip. UGH! I purchased at a local office supply store and bought the ""assurance"" plan, but now I just want my $$ back. It's too bad that the company can't give the bag a handle that lives up to the rest of the bag. Not worth the headaches and I'm currently looking to replace it."
5,Just fantastic,"This computer rolling is just fantastic: Very good quality, Strong and with a very big room to carry the laptop a complete mobile office and at least 2 day clothes. It's the best one. I have the Potomac model for daily use too."
3,The handle has major issues!,"While the case itself is sturdy and funtional, potential purchasers should pay close attention to negative consumer comments about the handle. I did not, and now regret buying this product. The handle is often difficult to raise and lower. It gets stuck in the up, middle, and lowered position. We have other rolling cases, by other manufacturers, where the teloscoping handles work great. I expected more from Swiss Gear."
3,"Great case, but with a weak spot!","The Wenger case lives up to its ""Swiss Army"" connection. Capable of carrying a decent sized laptop, and a portable printer, with power supplies, etc. And there is still room for personal items. A great case with a single flaw.Build quality is top notch, and well engineered, save for the telescoping handle. The latches thereon are apparently a weak spot. My wifes (a xmas gift) failed - of course - three days after the Amazon return time limit.Of course, it may simply be the case is capable of holding a heavier load than the handle can handle. (groan)"
3,extended arm is the tricky part,"Everything about the capacity and the strength of the stitching is well-made. Unfortunately, the arm of the bag pulled right out, so there seems to be some construction issues with this bag."
2,Broken handle,"I also had the handle go kaput. However, I contacted Wenger and got no response back. Have contacted them again... Still hoping for a response and replacement. Considering what I paid for this laptop bag, I expected it to last much longer and am very unhappy that I got less than 1 year out of it. I liked the bag very much which is why I gave it any stars. It has a lot of storage and is better than any other options I have seen, but is ridiculous to last this short a time for this price. This seller rips you off on shipping, too! $20 to ship a 5 pound bag? I bought it from the same seller a year ago and it was a rip off then. But like I said, it was the best option then. I would not buy it again."
3,"A good tool for historians, genealogists, etc.","Maps on a wide variety of subjects are included, fromnatural resources, elections results, Civil War tacticalmaps, settlement patterns, etc. Not flashy at all, nocolor maps, but useful nonetheless"
4,A couple bad apples,"This is probably Thursday's best album. There is some really great songwriting on here. The only problem is that Thursday is not a very consistent band. For every good song they have about 3 or 4 bad ones. The same problem is appears on ""Full Colapse"". But their latest album just plain sucks..."
4,Good,"This CD is very good. I went to see AFI in concert and discovered this band there. They sound different live, but actually sound better unlike many bands. This is a great band. A piece of information I picked up at the concert, the song Ian Curtis is about a gay guy they new who commited suicide, just thought that was interesting. Anyways, its a great cd."
3,I Just Have To Say Something..,"I haven't even heard this album. I like Thursday a bit. Full Collapse and War All The Time are decent Albums. Emo is far from my favorite genre but its produced some good bands. I just had to write this review because Adrian Davies wrote in his review that insted of listening to posers like Thursday we should listen to bands like From Auteum To Ashes, Atreyu or Avenged Sevenfold. Because those bands aren't posers right? HA! Have you heard the new Avenged Sevenfold? Its some of the worst crap i've ever heard. They're far from hardcore. They're closer to Good Charlote. Atreyu had to cover Bon Jovi songs becasue even that stuff is more authentic then their crappy catalouge. At least Thursday is honest with their music and there is passion behind their playing. Which is less then can be said about those fakes in Avenged Sevenfold. If you don't believe me, take a song like ""Paris In Flames"" and play it next to ""Bat Country"" and tell me which is more intence and ""heavy."""
1,dumb-ass posers,"this cd is so fuckin bad i cant even begin to describe it. the guitars sound whiny. note to the vocalist: sounding out of tune doesn't make you ""abstract"" or like robert smith, it makes you seem like you cant sing. these kids need to get some lessons for their instruments, beccause they cant play them at all. the drummer has some good moments and some of the songs (ian curtis and streaks in the sky) hint at something close to greatness, but its shortly ruined by those horrible guitars or that awful voice. what we have here is a bunch of wiggers who cant play for beans, like poison the well or my chemical romance or the used or some other poser band.please save your ears and your money for some real hardcore music like avenged sevenfold, from autumn to ashes or even a band like atreyu is better then this fake-poser ""hardcore""."
4,A very solid first album,"My friend is really into this band, but I wasn't that interested till I looked at their musical influences. I thought they had some good ones, so I decided to give them a chance. I really like this release. I've heard Full Collapse, Five Stories Falling, and War All The Time as well, and this album is my favorite out of all of them. Geoff is a very talented lyricist, and while the band can sound a bit same-y at times, I think overall, they're a talented band worth looking into, and I'd recommend this album.Oh, and this is for a previous reviewer, Brandon from Nashville, TN USA: I don't know where you got your supposed information from, but Ian Curtis was the vocalist of highly influential post punk band Joy Division, whom committed suicide in 1980. Just clearing up any confusion."
3,Thursday is a very talented band..but,"first geoff has an amazing voice and talent, but it's not meant to be used as is in this type of music. it's not for this post hardcore and a little less screaming would help. if you want hard music listen then dimmu borgir and if you like the light then listen to smashing pumpkins, but this melodic just cant cut those beautiful pitches he sings with those wretched screams. thursday has very well written lyrics and guitar always kept in 4/4. i enjoy talent the who but these just cant make 4 star material. if there was less screamin. back to the music, umm..... well beautiful guitar sheer brilance and great rythem but the drummer could use a few lessons if you ask me. if you like deftones, you'll hate this, if you like talent you must like it with acward vocals and omg the screams uck... if you like thursday this is the place 2 start."
4,Great but short,"This is the first Thursday CD I bought about 3 or 4 years ago. I fell in love with the band and bought all their albums. But ""Waiting"" really stands out from the rest as being truly raw and full of emotion. Geoffs voice is amazing and you can really feel him when he sings. Standout songs are obviously Porcelain, I love how they included violins on This Side of Brightness, and Ian Curtis and The Dotted Line are also great. If you are new to Thursday you should probably buy War All the Time first, then work your way back."
2,Replay,"The premise of the story was interesting, but the story itself seemed like a rehash of the Poseidon Adventure. This was very disappointing!"
2,MaxLite MiniBulb,I've had 2 of 10 bulbs burn out at 10% of their rated life.Disappointment!!I NOW HAVE 4 OF 10 BULBS BURN OUT. 11/09
4,Good product,"Personally, I bought this for use in my cosmetics--like shea butter hair mixtures and lotions. On first opening the product, the smell was quite disgusting (but I'm sure that this is how the product smells naturally). I never smelled aloe juice like that before. But, it still works in my products nonetheless. I can't tell the difference between it and any other brand. Aside from the disgusting smell, it works. I haven't tried drinking it and to be honest, don't think I want to. Yuck."
5,Daltin,Best CD ever. I never could find it in a store finally got on Amazon which made it so easy. Shipping & pricing good. Came in perfect condition. So Thanks.
4,What a life; What a movie,"I want to say that I really loved this book. The author takes us on one of the best adventure stories of human life that I have read in quite some time. Even though the central theme is his holocost survival he does not dwell on the subject too long, or I should say just long enough. His real adventure begins when he gets out. Learning to survive in the camps gave him the ability to achieve and become successful in life.I hope Hollywood picks this one up. I'd love to see it on the screen."
3,The Cap,"This book is a great insight into how the horrific events of the holocaust affected one man's life. Readers can better relate to just how terrible the holocaust was. The personal aspects of the book added a touching angle that reached out to readers. It also painted a picture of before and after the war too.The book was confusing at times because of the way it jumped around from one time period to another. However, it contained interesting and shocking stories from Frister's life. the book details his youth in Silesia and then his experiences in Nazi concentration camps. It also follows his life after the end of the war when he becomes a journalist in Poland and then emigrates to Israel. The Cap really showed how the holocaust changed the author. While he was not void of emotions, he became a hardened man due to the traumatic events he lived through.While his writing style left some to be desired, the content was very detailed, informational, and intriguing."
1,Trust the one star reviews,I'm running the latest Pinnacle Studio 10. This software crashes so frequently that I would seriously question this company's ability to stay solvent over the next couple years. My hardware and software exceeds all of Pinnacle's requirements. I have wasted hours due to quirky and irratic behavior of this software. I'm not going to go into excruciating detail here because there appear to be a LOT of one-star reviews. I've read most of them and suggest you do so as well. Trust the one-star reviewers. It's too bad there's not a no-star rating.
1,IF YOU LIKE SOFTWARE YOU CANNOT GET INSTALLED BUY IT!,"I WORKED AND WORKED WITH TECH HELP TRYING TO INSTALL STUDIO 9 PLUS THAT CAME WITH MOVIEBOX DELUXE.I HAVE NEVER HAD ANYONE TELL ME TO TRY TO INSTALL IT IN THE SAFE MODE. OF COURSE I AM AN IDIOT, SO I DID, AND OF COURSE THE INSTALLER STILL WOULD NOT FINISH THE JOB.THEY SAID YOU MUST HAVE A BAD DISC. I SAID I DON'T THINK SO.I HAVE A TWO HOUR DRIVE TO RETURN THIS JUNK TO BEST BUY."
1,Waste of Money,"I bought this software on the recommendation of a coworker. I have spent hours trying to get it to do anything useful, with no success whatsoever. I cannot understand how to import video from a file into the program. Nothing works. If anyone would explain how to do it, I would be very grateful. Thanks."
1,Frustrating and troublesome,Just to try and help others avoid the problems I've had. This programme has eaten hours and hours of my time. Not only with crashes but also sound problems and rendering freezes and all sorts. I've wasted hours with tech support and despite my best efforts and following all their long and arduous suggestions none of the 3 major problems have been solved. I simply cannot produce an edited movie with it. I'm just about to give up after 5 long hard months of persistence and buy a different package. My system is 3.4 GHz and 250 GB with 1024 RAM.
1,Dissapointed!!!,"I had high hopes for this software despite the poor reviews but alas, they were dead on. It is slow quirky and troublesome, even after installing the updates. I have given up and am now using Adobe Premiere which runs circles around this ""bottleneck"" of a product. On top of selling a bad product, they would not send me my rebate, claiming I neglected to send the bar code off the box which I did. I will never purchase another Pinnacle product!"
3,Bugs don't stop fabulousness,"I love the Pinnacle studio 9!!! I made a bunch of films with my friends on it, and they turned out very well. BUT, it seems to crash frequently. SO, I bought the Movie Edit pro 10, which seems to be better. I Would say that Pinnacle studio 9 would work much better if they didn't charge 20 $ a effect and debug it."
4,Works like a charm,"I read all the bad reviews AFTER I had purchased this software. I must admit I was going to return it before I even opened the package. Finally, though, I did open the package and installed Studio 9 PLUS without any problems. I have since made numerous videos with no problems worth mentioning. It did error out a couple of times during the editing stage but I have learned to save early and often. And considering the many hours that I have spent in Studio, the fact that I received an error only a couple of times didn't really bother me. So far, so good!"
1,Infested,"This is the buggiest piece of software I have ever owned. Multiple crashes under varied situations. I installed the 9.3.5 patch (even the installation was buggy), but it didn't solve the problems of repeated crashes during DVD burning. I have gobs of RAM and storage, as recommended. The manual even has troubleshooting tips for situation after situation like, ""Studio crashes when . . . "" Trouble is, the solutions don't work.I agree with a previous reviewer: Stay away!"
1,Rendering hangs,Upgraded to latest version (9.4.3) but unable to create a DVD as Studio hangs when rendering. No response from Pinnacle customer services. Avoid.
2,Freezes constantly,"I received a version with a video camera. I paid for an upgrade and regret it. I have had nothing but problems, and I substantially exceed the minimum system requirements. Capturing drops frames and I often have to capture in light version of Ulead Studio then edit in Studio 9. About half the time it freezes. One project I created freezes on the same frame every time. I can break out that part of the video and have no problem in writing that to a DVD file. But if I put the same clip in a project that uses several clips, it freezes. I am a professional computer troubleshooter and am very disappointed in this."
1,I thought it was just me,"I bought this software based upon the CNET reviews and sales associate reviews. I have a sony DVD cam...Pinnacle would not capture video from it. So I had to use the sony software to convert to MPEG, then import the MPEG files into Pinnacle. The rendering/DVD buring features are terrible. I used the cheap NERO software to assemble and burn my videos. I thought it was just my computer that crashes. Everything takes 5 times longer than it should with this program. I have newborn twins and I video everyhting. I don't have a lot of time to deal with editing...with thos program, I end up doing it in the middle of the night becasue it takes so long. Also, why do they have to charge extra for advanced features? Either include them with the package or dont have them...don't tease us. I was ready to buy a new computer becasue I thought that mine just couldn't handle video editing technology. I'm glad I didn't...it's c lot cheaper to buy a better editing product."
1,don't buy it! upgrade is a real pain!,"This is my first review ever. After struggling (make that wasting too many hours)trying to make the upgrade to Plus work, I am giving up. They simply did not test this product to get it right before shipping. The Serial Number in the box it came with doesnt work, then they say they have a work around, but that doesnt work either.Don't get me wrong, Studio is a good product, but honestly, I dont have the hours to put in to get their bugs out so it works. This is a terrible business practice. I have two standard XP computers and it won't work on either of them, I wouldnt do this upgrade if I were you."
5,Like a Dream in the Cuban Night,Peruchin Jr.'s work is transcendent. The most beautiful music I own.
5,A Crackerjack War Novel!,"The War Mountains is a great World War Two read, John Mannock's third in a row. American and British commandos parachute into the winter mountains of Yugoslavia to help Marshall Tito's Partisans head off the advance of the Nazi SS Division known as ""Handschar"" - a combat division made up entirely of volunteer Muslims! And it really existed! Just when you think you've heard it all... There's a lot of skullduggery with Hitler, Himmler, the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, and deeply buried OSS and SOE operatives, plus the usual great Mannock cast of slightly weird characters. This is a great novel, and you should buy it immediately. Sooner even!"
2,a letdown compared to Mannock's previous work,"I loved Iron Coffin and Sen-Toku Raid, but this book, while adequately written, just doesn't break any new ground or intrigue me in the least. It kept reminding me of some not-all-that-good action movie that constantly shows on TV with lots and lots of commercials.This book leads me to believe that Mannock is a great writer about the sea, but WORTHLESS when it comes to dry land!!!"
1,"Wooden, derivative",Some amazing plot devices that overlap with the film version of The Guns of Navarone.
4,Learn how to write Devanagari,"This is a book that teaches you how to write Devanagari letters. You will learn order of strokes to form all the vowels and consonants and also eight frequently used conjunct characters (consonant plus consonant).You will find in books or on internet many different methods to form Devanagari letters, but I like the method presented here. It is an easy and natural way to form the letters.My only objection is that there is no information on how to form consonant plus vowel combination. I still do not know how to write correctly for example ""ki"", ""kii"", ""ke"" or ""kai"". That is the only reason I gave this book four and not five stars."
2,"Not enough practice, but still a guide to stroke order","I was a little disappointed in this book because each letter appears only once (with 5 letters to a page). I much prefer Thomas Egenes'*Learning the Sanskrit Alphabet*. In Egenes' book, two full pages are devoted to each letter, with multiple squares for tracing, for writing on your own, and for coming back to each letter after a few days for practice. There are also practice exercises in the back, including opportunities to write complete words.Unfortunately Egenes' book is currently unavailable,and this book is only $4 and gives the stroke order, so it might still be a good option."
1,This is not history,"I am not sure how to describe this book, but clearly its claim to be ""history"" is really misleading. Whatever it is it is badly organized.The author seems to be trying to employ a sort of movie flashback system of relating history, but what the educated reader will get is confusion followed by boredom. If you are seeking to learn something of the history of Poland you are not going to get it from this volume. This is one of the worst books I have ever read whatever it is supposed to be."
5,Excellent,"Well written book, takes a very comprehensive look at the history of not just Poland, but the entire region, and the forces that shaped it. The narration is reverse-chronological, starting with the most recent events, and tracing them back in history. It's worth reading just for his thesis about Poland's history bein characterized by cycles of great idealism and great pragmatism - a paradoxical merger, but one that works to this day."
5,Books covers borders for pieced and applique techniques,"If you can't decide what kind of border to add to your quilt, read this book. It covers borders, from simple pieced to advanced appliqued designs. Find out how to make your borders fit your quilts. Sixteen patterns are included for pieced and appliqued borders. Whether you prefer beautiful floral designs, swags, or a dogtooth edge, these are just some of the designs included in this book."
4,Neat gift..,"I bought these as a gift to my son for Christmas. The magnets were expensive but he enjoyed them. My 13 year old brother loved playing with them too. Despite the cost, these magnets are quite fun and the magnets are strong."
5,my grandson loves them,I bought these for my 3 yr old grandson for Christmas and he just loves them! He played with them for hours! will be buying additional packs for him.
2,just ok,"i bought this activity kit because we already had the cd and i wanted to also have the lyrics. unfortunately, the 2 cds (the one we already have and the one from the kit) contain different songs. this cd is good, but not what i was looking for. also, the lyrics in the activity kit aren't complete and on at least 1 song, don't even have the lyrics in the language in which the song is sung."
2,not very good,"I bought this book on the strength of Cora Diamond's blurb on the back cover. I was very disappointed. Especially in his discussion of rule following, Brenner does not so much explain the relevant ideas as he paraphrases them. (An example: in his discussion of sections 206-223, Brenner imagines someone asking ""suppose different people respond in diffferent ways to the same order. Who is right?"" He answers, ""if there is an established practice among these people then the right way will mean the customary way."" The answer is a direct paraphrase of the text around section 201. But simply paraphrasing or extracting from the text gets us nowhere. If you already understand Wittgenstein, you will understand this remark. If not you won't. Either way, it won't much help.) Brenner's discussion of the private language argument is better. But there's still _much_ better expository material available."
2,Is the Basic Premise really his own?,A question to you all.Isn't Wit's basic premise about language and truth just a slant on Sausseurian linguistics with lots of blather and a critique of his (Wit's) prior incarnation in the Tractatus? (the tractatus being the single most pseudo and naive work in the history of phi in my opinion and Wit's first book.)
3,High-interest? Not so much!,"This book has many articles that can be used to compare and contrast, but they are far from high interest. My students really don't find a story comparing Elvis Prestley and Michael Jackson very interesting. There are some nice stories, but not very up to date for today's middle schooler."
4,Very tasty,"Decided to try this out with no information on the product or past experience with the company because I'm familiar with powdered soup mix in general and if this one specifically tasted weird I could probably do something myself to make it better.The soup is good. Four stars because the garlic and onion flavors are a bit strong. If you are on a low sodium diet, you'll want to steer clear, because the sodium content is pretty high. To be expected with a product like this, but you never can tell.Over all, I don't regret my purchase, and may even buy again in the future."
5,Best Broccoli & Cheddar Soup... EVER!,"I discovered this at the local Fry's (Kroger) supermarket (usually runs a little over $4.90/bag there) but is the BEST there is! Hearty, rich flavor, lots of little broccoli pieces and one bag yields about 10 cups of soup. I like to add a little parmesan and cooked chicken pieces to mine... AWESOME!! You know how every flavor of Campbell's soups all have that same ""taste""? Bear Creek will turn you back on to soup. I could eat this every day and never get tired of it."
5,Some good soup,Price per serving is three times more at the grocery so this is a real savings. The Bear Creek brand is NOT a thin watery soup and reconstitutes well from the powdered mix.
1,Bettie I LOVE YOU - But NOT this Film!!!,"Unless you MUST have anything & everything that has Bettie Page - STAY AWAY FROM THIS ONE! - The quality of snippets are OK, but no facts. And the Music they put with her is HORRIBLE, it doesn't match her dancing, they don't even time it to end with each dance. Betty Page: Bondage Queen and America's Pinup: Betty Page, both on DVD are a much better TRIBUTE to Bettie Page, and the TRUE connoisseur of Bettie will enjoy these. Don't BUY this tape it will only encourage the group that made it to make more!"
3,SLOWER PACE,"WHEN YOU THINK OF ARTY SHAW, OR TOMMY DORSEY, YOU USEALLY THINK OF FAST PACED DANCE MUSIC. THIS IS VERY MOOD MUSIC, TO PLAY IN THE BACKGROUND AT A PARTY, OR ROMANTIC INTERLUDE, BUT SADLY NOT A BOUNCE IN IT."
3,Music from poor downtown streets of the 60s and early 70s tehran,"Music with female vocalist characteristic of the poor downtown streets of the 60s and early 70s tehran. Its not complicated music, but has cute percussion and soulish (a la iranian) vocals. Includes ""Setareh"". The style of this music in Iran is known as: Laati!"
3,Why????,"I agree. I can't believe ""Gigot"" is not in this collection!! It was one of my favorite Gleason films!"
2,Oh my!,"I so love Jackie and continue to watch his antics where I find them;but I must say, this collection was really not what it could have been.I was very unhappy with the content quality. Please! Jackie lovers uniteand insist upon a product worth his weight, in gold, please! Just sayin'..."
1,Bait and Switch,"I was searching on amazon.com for the movie ""Soldier in the Rain."" This item came up #1. That movie is not on the DVD at all! Instead, what you get is a 1-hour movie made in 1942 and two 1/2-hour appearances on TV variety shows. I returned the DVD."
2,Gigot,Gigot was one of his best films. It was broadcast on Cinemax in the 90's and I recorded it on VHS. I too wish they would release it on DVD.
3,Not a fan of the orchestral arrangements,"While I love Kandia's voice and most of the music on this album, the tracks with the orchestral arrangements (and, for that matter some of the tracks rife with horns) ruin it for me."
4,explosive stuff,"Have read all Travis & co books I do not know how many times over, yet am buying new copies if one of the titles is lost somewhere. I cannot explain what makes me go back to the slip in Fort Lauderdale over and over again. There is something in Mr. MacDonald's writing that has me in its grip and I cannot pry me loose. Try it yourself - you have been warned."
3,"A light read, more character study than mystery","Travis and Meyer set out to unravel the accidental death of Meyer's niece and new nephew-in-law, and quickly discover it is more insidious than accidental.MacDonald's book is a fairly engaging read, more a character study of the criminal than a mystery. However, the investigators engage in a little too much pop psychology too early in the book, which accounts for the pace of the story slowing down somewhat in the last 1/3 of the book.,MacDonald is enough of a skilled storyteller, though, that for the most part, the book is a fairly fast and engaging read."
3,I can't get too worked up...,"about this book. If ""Free Fall in Crimson"" is the weakest in the McGee series this book isn't too far behind it. I enjoyed it more than Free Fall but it certainly has some awkward spots, especially plotwise. But you can't hit the bell everytime and MacDonald wrote a lot of books. That a very few weren't up to his usual standard is certainly to be expected. It isn't a bad book but it just isn't up to the usual MacDonald work."
4,a good mystery,I really enjoyed the book. The most interstering parts were when Travis was thinking about why he didn't want to leave Florida.He was thinking about the dolphins and the birds that he would miss. It felt like I wouldn't want to leave either. Another part I like was when travis and Meyers were walking through the shopping mall and the difference between the neardie teens and the teen who were playing the average vidio games. I almost cried. I was thinking about the teens from Colobine High School from Colorado. If those kids have hung in there they would have been the new elete. and the jokes would have been middle magement if that. I loved the part about how Travis was talking to the lady from a small town in Texas to find killer. I am from Texas and that how talk. It was really funny
3,Manga is way better,"Love Hina Again is better than the anime series. Christmas Movie, Spring Movie, and Again were my favorite of all of the animed series, but the Comic series, is better.The comics run for a while longer than the anime. Things are explained in more detail and I'd consider the manga's story much better than that of the anime.I'd say they swayed a little too far away from the original work while adapting this. But it's still pretty good. (So long as they didn't try to translate the word ""tanuki"")"
3,"Good, but..","All in all these 3 movies were good, but in my own opinion the drawing style for the three movies was just lacking a bit. Also, the story line wasn't as detailed as the manga series. The final movie, Love Hina Again, really got me irriated a bit. I thought it would, in a way, follow suit with the end of the manga, but the ending just leaves you hanging, which is irriating. I suspect that there probably is going to be another Love Hina tv movie, but I am not fully sure. I openly buy it, but I rather suggest to you all to buy all the 14 manga series. They are a hell alot better and you get to see more..you know..the stuff that Keitaro keeps getting hit by when peeking in the Spring Bath.."
3,hey it's ok,so this product is ok for allergy sufferers but just buy Allersearch spray if you want real relief.
4,An excellent Polish cookbook,"""The Art of Polish Cooking"" is an excellent Polish cookbook. There are, about, 500 very good recipes for almost any occasion. Also on the plus side, there is a good section on Polish customs and favorite menuses for various occasions. Also, there are many good recipes for cake and other desserts.However, there are only a few recipes for bread. There are no photos and not enough drawings of finished dishes.On the whole, I think this Polish cookbook is very good to excellent and offers many recipes for a reasonable price. However, there is a need to supplement this book with another that covers the areas missing in this one."
3,the art of polish cooking,"I was not too impressed with this cookbook ,the only thing that I really liked is the assortment of recipes for sweets."
1,Makes Me Literally Sick,"I don't know what the big f*cking hype is about this album... It's a mixture of nu-metal, rap/hip-hop, synth, and about 5% punk. Just because Tim Armstrong and Co. plus Brody from the Distillers are on the recordings does NOT make it good. But hey, these types of music are accepted in today's corporate mainstream music industry, so it MUST be cool,...right? WRONG! This is a mockery of everything that is good and pure in music. Musicians these days... (Shakes head in disgust)"
1,oh my god is this bad,"if you like this record (and are old enough to know any better) you're prolly a douche. No ammount of hair coloring, facial piercings or studded accessories will hide this fact. I hate to break it to you so harshly but it needed to be said."
1,Why Tim?,Rancid was my favorite band for many years...but...since the album Rancid and Indestructible...it change my mind...I just wanna remember rancid like the band who made the Let's go album and ...and out come the wolves!! (my favourite album...this album represent Rancid)!!Transplants Sucks!! Sucks!!I really deslike Blink 18...something guys!!Why Tim?
4,So Close,"Tim Armstrong is a brilliant individual. Musically this album is great and Mr. Armstrong is at his vocal best, but there is a problem. The problem comes in the form of Rob Aston. He has some good moments (Tall Cans In The Air, Sad But True, California Babylon and DJ DJ) but overall he brings the quality of this album down. Down in Oakland is a standout track. From the sound of this album Rancid's next venture should be amazing. Travis seems to hold his own, but his work is minimal. Matt Freeman and Davey Havoc are a welcome addition."
4,Good stuff,I was expecting a little more. I wanted more Tim Armstrong dance hall reggae stuff. It's good none the less. Allot of cool sounds and interesting melding. Still I was looking for more songs like DJ DJ and California Babylon. Armstrong makes this one worth your money. the only [bad] part is the other dudes singing. I don't see the charm in it.
4,Needs work on the lyrics.,"Don't get me wrong, this CD was pretty good, but some fo the lyrics are really stupid. All the lyrics are about are guns, dead people, and weed. In the very bad song ""Qick Death"" the lyrics sounded like they came out of an album by Sum 41 or the Kottonmouth Kings. This CD did have good points though. ""DJ, DJ,"" ""Sad But True,"" ""D.R.E.A.M., ""We Trusted You,"" ""California Babylon"", and ""One Seventeen"" were all songs turned out really good. ""Diamonds and Guns"" had good piano, lyrics, and drums, but the song gets old after you listen to it for a while. I think this CD should be sold only towards people 13 and up becausde of the lyrics in some of the songs. Besides some bad points in this CD, this CD is overall a great buy. Plus, it comes with a free poster."
1,WACK!,"Just when you thought the mall punk community was safe from ""I got more money than you / Our crew is deeper than yours... hip-hop, The Transplants make the idea of suburban Rancid fans speaking like Ja Rule a reality. Kudos to The Transplants for inventing the rap / punk genre. These guys are pioneers! Expect that gutter punk asking you for change in front of every show to be saying, ""Holla!"" in about two weeks."
1,Don't waste your time,"I am a big Rancid fan and went out and bought this immediately since Tim Armstrong was involved, but it is a total waste. Possibly two good songs but another ten that are terrible. Stupid lyrics and just a bad overall attempt for a record. The CD will make a nice coaster."
1,this cd,"sounds like a mix between the beach boys, crap and some sort of punk singer it is not worth the money"
1,goodness,"Sh*#, this is so bad. Save your money, you'll need it to buy good original music. These guys need help. Oh by the way, there's no such thing as punk music anymore so stop using that word, and to the guy saying they invented punk-rap, you should be locked."
1,this cd,"sounds like a mix between, the beach boys, crap and some sort of an excuse for a punk vocalist (if you could call it that)"
4,I liked it,"I liked it. It's catchy and listenable, especially good if you're running or driving. It's not a five because it really isn't all that good. Tall Cans in the Air and Diamonds and Guns are the best. Should really be a 3 and a half. I liked it, but I'm not just going to give out 5s everywhere am I?As to the person who said the singer needs singing lessons-- and then recommended Deftones-- lol if anyone needs singing lessons it's the guy from Deftones. Besides, this is punk and is just relaxed music so you don't need a great singer.I rented this from the library, but I think I might have bought it. Actually I just bought Whitmore- buy that as well.DEADBOLT"
2,Holla,"Dude, this cd is terrible. Rancid is okay, and blink and boxcar racer are good, too ( i have no idea where this rob joker who sings or whatever is from). Anyways, this is just a bad idea from the start. Rap-punk? Hard to believe that credible musicians came up with this and not some marketing guy. THe beats are solid, and the guitars are pretty good, too. But the rapping? Are you joking? And i thought Fred Durst couldn't rap. I guess now all the 12 yeard old Blink 41 fans will be walking around going, ""holla"" or whatever. You should just buy a rap cd instead."
3,It's at least better than Methods of Mayhem...,"Well, a rap-metal supergroup featuring Rancid's Tim Armstrong and Blink182 drummer Travis Barker is bound to raise more than a few eyebrows. So, is it any good? It depends on how you listen to it. The album's main flaw is that it's almost impossible to decipher whether or not the material is supposed to be taken seriously, or if it is all one big tongue-in-cheek joke. As the former, this album fails. There is nothing lyrically (or musically) potent enough on here to motivate or inspire. As the latter, this album is brilliant. It is basically embracing all of the cliches, forming a breezy and enjoyable rap-rock disc. No doubt, this CD is a good listen. And although it's not extremely intelligent or well thought out, it has great production and plenty of interesting samples put to use. I doubt this group will be around forever, but we can at least enjoy this album for the time being. It makes a good summer listen. Just don't think too hard about it."
1,Very disappointing,"After reading all the reviews here and on The Transplants website, I expected some exciting, new punk fusion sounds.Instead, I find this album boring and unoriginal. The only song I really like is ""Diamonds and Guns"". Unfortunately, that is the song I sampled before buying the CD."
2,POSERS!,"so i had to redo this entire review, because i just recently learned the definition of PUNK. This band roots off of the poser punk, long time sold out rancid. Now, im not knocking the good ol' days of rancid, like lets go and out come the wolves, those are classics, but indestructible is the sorriest excuse for punk ive ever heard! Anyway, this band sold out on its first album, not very punk rock of you ask me. Check out dead kennedys, or the adicts, now thats some kick ass punk that has been around for more than 20 years and has yet to sell out!"
1,a warning to parents,"the language is vulgar! i cannot believe they do not have an ""parental advisory"" on the label. my son recently asked what an extremely vulgar word was. he was even singing along to this word i thought since no advisory was posted that it was ok! please parents beware! didnt have a choice to put ""o"" stars or i would have."
3,Whoa... From Rancid 02 to this,"I dont know where to start about this CD besides I think Tim wants to be known but i respect that because hes my idol, well i didnt think that he'd be doing something like this after the last album Rancid put out and then Brody's and The Distillers release of Sing Sing, Death House. Well i am gonna consider this just THE TRANSPLANTS one of a kind. after all its a good CD im hoping to see a new Rancid CD hopefully.Jeff"
4,Not for every fan,"If you loved Rancid, and fell in love with Box Car Racer or blink 182, stay away. This is not punk rock. This is a mish mash of music. Ths CD is good if you enjoy music that is different.The music itself is creative. Not suprising, but considering what goes into it, you'll feel your jaw drop.Don't buy this unless you know you'll like it. Download a couple songs, and go from there. I like it, but know that not everyone will."
4,Not a Rancid album,"Don't buy this album expecting a Rancid clone or even a solid punk album. It is a fusion album that borrows heavily from other sources than punk. It's a definite change of pace for Tim Armstrong, not to say that's all bad. It lacks the urgency and energy of Rancid but it does grow on you. It's an interesting experiment and I'm glad that he found a side project to do this experiment in."
2,I wanted To Love it.....,"Bieng A huge operation ivy fan, I set out to listen to and love all of the music the band went on to make after they had broken up. I have to say, I wanted to love this album really bad... But the terrible truth is that it blows. really bad. it hurts me to say this, after all Tim Armstrong is in this band... But it seriiously sucks. A shame to... It's really a waste of money to buy this album. And if you are a diehard operation ivy fan like me, you'll feel terrible and ashamed that your favorite band went on to make this crap."
3,Better than I expected,"Well, when i first heard of this band i was immediatley interested becuz of tim armstrong. But when i heard Rob Aston was in it i was disappointed. i hate rap and i assumed it would completely ruin the cd. well i was wrong. sometimes robs rapping actually worx. SOMETIMES. other times his rapping, or shall we say screaming is unbearable. personally i think the album would be better without him, but he's not as bad as i expected. o and if you are anti-blink182, dont worry about it. travis is an awesome drummer and i cant deny it."
5,Awesome album!!,"I'm a fan of Rancid and even though i don't really like Blink Travis Barker is a wicked drummer so i decided to check this cd out.I wasn't dissapointed,this cd is amazing and unlike anything else i've ever heard.I haven't stopped listening to it since i bought it in April, ""Diamonds and Guns"" is constantly stuck in my head it's so catchy! Other hilights for me would have to be ""Sad But True"",""California Babylon"" and ""We Trusted You"".This is a great album check it out,also Rancid's new album""Indestuctible"" is awsome too."
5,another gem form the rancid pit,anything these guys do either lars and the bastards or transplants it just turns out to be awsome. djdj and one seventeen are good tracks hopefully new one will come soon.heard from their site it was already done
2,Weekend Project,"It sound like this album was written and put together all in one weekend. Overall I think its pretty poor but being a big rancid fan i cant help but like it enough to give it two stars. You can definatly see the influence of many Hellcat Record bands in this album... except the rap, I'm really not sure if I agree with that. But overall, the lyrics aren't very good and the riffs very repetitive. Some songs are kinda catchy but they will get old fast. I don't agree with people badmouthing Tim Armstrong though; it's good to hear different experimental musics from punks, its a change from the trendy skate punk rock of nowadays."
1,"Ok, Now this was seriously bad.","I was excited to hear the album after hearing abouyt the members, and hearing Diamonds and guns. I was SEVERELY disapointed. The rap made me feel uneasy, and I listen to thrash, all types of metal, and punk. I really felt tortured listening to this. It's a rap album with the exception of a guitar and drums in the bg. hardly worth listening to for that. I can usually stand rap rock, but this got on my bad side. The only songs I liked on this were diamonds and guns, and DREAM."
1,Transplants are lame,"I thought this was going to be a good modern metal/punk CD but it is pretty lame. They kinda sound like punk/wannabe rappers. The music is not good.I dont listen to the CD at all , I now know why the original owner sold it.......To sum it up ....It Sucks...."
5,Excellent Album,"This album is one of the greatest albums I have ever heard. Tim Armstrong, Rob Aston, Travis Barker, and special guests including Davey Havok from AFI and Brody Armstrong from Distillers, do a superb job of mixing rock, rap, punk, reggae, and metal all into one. Travis Barker from Blink 182 actually does a good job of drumming. And just because they have a Blink 182 member doesn't mean anything. None of the songs sound like Blink 182. As for the different style for everybody. For rappers, good tracks to listen towould be Tall Cans In the Air and D.R.E.A.M.. For punks good songs would be Sad but True and One Seventeen. For rock you have D.J.D.J. and Weigh On My Mind. For reggae fans you might want to listen to California Babylon or Down In Oakland. As for metal, the best songs would be Romper Stomper and Quick Death. All those great genres can be found in one song on the songs Diamonds and Guns and We Trusted You. To anyone I reccomend to buy this CD."
5,GREAT ALBUM,"tranplants, a side project of travis barker and t. armstrong combines essences of punk, hardcore, dance beat, and rap/hiphop. many say that it includes some metal, but that is plain bull, it's hardcore not metal, and that's easy to see by anyone who has ever heard the two. Anyway, all the songs are GREAT, except for D.R.E.A.M. which i think is just okay (after you listen to it a couple of times it gets pretty lame). As for the rest, i could listen to them over and over again for a couple of months (which i already have done)."
4,My Big Fat Head,"I really enjoyed reading this book because I could relate to the author. Jodi Blase told my story! I also shared this book with my 15 year old daughter. It helped her a great deal, too. She now knows that she is NOT alone, and that there is help for her, too."
4,My Big Fat Head: Being obessive with food,Why we are not in control of ourselves over food while being emotion or stress out?
1,Can I get my money back??!!,"This was a terribly written book. I had to force myself to keep reading it because I thought there just HAD to be something useful in it. And there was, I identified with some of the author's thoughts/feelings, saw myself in her words, but this book had no real substance to it. Save your money."
5,Great toy for toddlers!,"Whether or not your child is ""in to"" Thomas, these take along toys are great for toddlers. I believe any child 18 months old will love these little guys. The magnets make it easy for little people to hook and unhook the cars. I can't say enough good things about them."
3,great at first flush,"I just spent a week wearing the Sealskins WaterBlocker Socks in the Boundary Waters of Northern Minnesota. The first day they were great, no leaks, sweat wicked out, comfortably damp feet. Then as the days went on I ran into some layer seperation problems. By the end of the week I could just as well have had on cotton socks. As soon as you stepped in water over the top of the sock it was full of water and stayed that way all day long. I would still rate them an excellent hiking and shallow water sock, but for the deeper water we got into, they were not worth the money."
5,"Love the book, Debbie is an amazing woman",Debbie brings you right into her life. You are there with her every step of the way. I have read the book and listened to the tapes several times and enjoy it each time.
5,Different,I bought this for my man who grew up Jewish and is now Christian. So he got the best of both worlds. Very different.
4,Kit's Mystery Party Game,The game was well written and fun for the girls. I played the adult role to move things along. The costume suggestions were easy to do and really added to the fun for the party. My only complaint was the game went much faster than suggested on the box. We were finished in 30 minutes instead of one hour! The girls that participated were 9-10 year olds. They wished it were longer as well or had a second mystery to solve.
5,Silat Seni Gayong,This book is the first of its kind. Thank you to Cikgu Sheikh Shamsuddin for wtiting this wonderfully informative book. Congratulations on your success and best of luck to the gayong practitioners around the world.
3,Book on Tradition,"Most of the book focuses on tradition and custom. Further, most of the illustrations on actual technique are rather small. The illustrations regarding the history of Silat are much larger than the ones regarding technique."
2,Not up to normal Victorinox standards,"I'm a big Victorinox fanboy, I own a full knife block of Forschners, a bunch of Swiss Army folding knives, several Forschner kitchen tools (the can opener is the only one I've found that works, period), and two Swiss Army watches. I have to say, this peeler didn't live up to normal Victorinox standards. It's very awkward to use, and has a very narrow ""peeling"" window. Meaning you have to hold it at a certain angle for it to work. It's SUPER lightweight. Almost feels like a dollar store toy peeler. Went into my junk drawer."
3,small and light weight,Thsi peeler is very small and light weight. It is easy to slip and strike your hand that is holding the peeled object. I would not buy another one.
4,"In 2 years, I haven't moved past the Pasta chapter!","I love to cook, and my family loves to eat, but we don't always have time for that! Nick Stellino has a wonderful repertoire of quick pasta dishes, for which we usually have the ingredients on hand(or can come close enough). These aren't your typical spaghetti and meatballs pastas, but interesting, exciting, alternatives that my whole family enjoys (I have 4 kids from 8 to 15). I can't live without this book, and his others!"
4,Buy 2: 1 to read and admire + 1 to use in your kitchen,"The flavor of Sicily in: --clearly written recipes and menus, both elaborate and simple, with tips to insure success; --beautiful color photographs of finished dishes; --elegant two tone photos of Sicilian scenes; --appealing design using the muted colors of clay and of stone; --heartwarming stories of a loving Sicilian family for whom the joys of living and of dining well are intertwined ... as are all the artful features of this charming book."
1,AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!! This is sickening and depraved.,"This is not the raved about 70's miniseries. It is a bad film with a twisted ""re-enactment"" of the fateful night when 5 people lost their lives in what is still the most vicious murder and weirdest true plot ever to have taken place."
2,"Bad movie, but historical footage","I bought this movie, basically knowing it would be awful and I wasn't disappointed. All the reviewers on here are right (except the two that gave it 5 stars) -it is a horrible movie. BUT, I gave it two stars.Why, you may ask? Because I read the great book by the same name, and it was very cool to see the scene with actual footage of Spahn ranch. (burned down not long after), and to see the scene with authentic hippies.The rest of the movie is throw away. If you want a good movie, don't buy this. If you loved the book, or are very interested in the Manson trial/family and want to see footage of Spahn ranch, here it is. Be warned - you'll get five or ten minutes of hippie/Spahn ranch footage."
1,Save Your $$$$$,The best thing about this terrible movie is the packaging it comes in. I'm sure that has been what's drawn viewers to either purchase and or rent it.I would personally rather wait to see the 1976 tele-film re-released to video and Dvd in it's full length instead of the cut down European theatrical version that was released years ago by Key Video.
1,The Helter-Skelter Murders,"For those real True Crime buffs who love great documentries on this type of subject, be sure to have a pillow and blanket ready when you view this movie. I promise you will be alseep after the first few minutes of this flick. Still trying to figure out how to get my money back on this one. The problem with this movie is unless you have read books on ""The family"" and ""Helter Skelter"" you will be completely lost. I sure hope Valium-productions is not hoping for an oscar on this film. My advice is steer clear of this one folks."
2,Read the book instead,"the best thing about this video is that they use Charles Manson's actual songs that he wrote and sang. It's basically a sloppy re-creation of what happened that terrible night for those unfortunate victims. ""Helter Skelter""is a much better film, and very insightful. This actor playing Manson should be [isn't very good] in this version. Worth a look only for the ending murder scenes where they re-create it rather acuratly. But, if your looking for the whole fact based, square one starting story on the Manson Family -skip it."
1,Read the book instead!,"Incomprehensible and disjointed ""story"" about the Manson Murders. Film gets one star for a somewhat convincing recreation of the murders, but other than that it's all downhill. I was right outside the house where the murders occurred early in 1993, and the house used here is completely different. Dust off your copy of ""Helter Skelter"" instead."
2,"Read the book or watch, ""Helter Skelter, 1978""","Best thing about this movie, if anything is that they play Manson's actual music recordings on the film.That's interesting enough. Oddly enough the man was talented. Pretty descriptive re-enactment of the murders that hot summer night. They go into detail and everything. That part was probably researched. Besides the ending, if you make it that far, the beginning, and middle is a complete waste of time."
1,oh dear lord does this movie stink!,"1 star was the lowest rating, if there were negatives to pick from...this movie would get it. please don't buy this movie unless you're looking to torment someone and put them into a coma. this is the worst movie i have ever seen in my entire life. I'm just grateful I bought it for $5 off of eBay instead of paying the actual amount it's sold for on Amazon. ANYTHING else you can find on Manson would be better than this, I'm sure!"
5,The best self-help book ever,I opened this book and smiled cover-to-cover. Sometimes the simplest message is the best of all. I bought copies for several friends.
5,Need cheering up? Go for this book!,"I received this little book as a gift and I couldn't help but smile! The author doeesn't claim to be a genius and he doesn't claim that this book will change your life. It isn't intellectual stuff, it's only purpose is to make you smile and it works!! It's just a sweet book containing pictures of animals for someone who is feeling down. What's wrong with that? I am a huge animal lover and I certainly dont think the pictures are degrading to animals! Anyone who suggests this has probably never cracked a smile in their entire life and they probably never will!!"
1,Unfortunate changes,"The original was good, the black and white pictures were fun, but the colorization of the black and whites makes it look tacky and cheap. Also there is one picture change that I find unfortunate--the pig mounting the sheep makes the book ugly. Bring back the original."
5,Best Book Ever,"This Book, is great for cheering people up. It has so many nice pictures of animals to brighten peoples days."
5,wonderful absolutely wonderful!,this book is very well illustrated and can brighten anyone's day! It is fun for anyone of any age. It can even be entertaining for children. Its just wonderful.
5,The best book ever,This book is great for everyone & anyone- this one of the best books I have ever seen - great photographer work & a great story to go along - this book makes you smile.
5,Hilarious!,Great book! My little brother bought two copies at the airport bookstore on his way home for Thanksgiving. Animal facial expressions and gestures certainly remind us to laugh and take life a little less serious.
5,The Blue Day Book,"This book is sure to cheer up anyone who is having a bad day. Even if you're having a good day, it will make you smile and chuckle. The animal pictures are hilarious."
5,this book rocks,"everytime i feel like smiling, i read this book. the pictures are perfect and so is the story he tells....it is by far my favorite book on my shelf!"
5,great to give to clients and friends,"I love this book. It reminds me of how things really are good even in the midst of it seeming bad. I have found these to be great presents to give to both my friends and business clients. A short book, I find myself picking it up and reading it every other week or so. The pictures of the animals are so easy to identify with. :)"
5,Buy as many as you can - terrific gifts!,"This book is fantastic! What a terrific pick-me-up! I keep one in the office library for those times anybody needs a pick-me-up. (Instant smiles). Anybody who's read this immediately thinks of at least 5 people they should buy this for. It's a great gift (give one to yourself, too). Everybody has blue days. This book is the perfect antidote."
5,share this with everyone you know,"I was hooked from the first page. The pictures are captivating and the captions are insightful and hysterical. You definitely do not have to be having a blue day to laugh out loud at this book, or for it to touch your heart. It is amazing."
4,Blue Day Book,"This book is really great. There is only one picture that I thought was not necessary to make the book great and that was the anything goes picture. Other wise it was a little expensive ..., bur a totally entertaining book that I have enjoyed sharing and looking through over and over again."
1,The Blue Day Book - anniversary edition,The pubisher has ruined one of my favorite gift idea! This new anniversary edition is HORRIBLE with colors that make me think someone is color blind and/or on drugs.RJ Gabriel
5,Best Pick-me-up I've ever seen!,"I bought this book for the first time when my daughter was about 12 and it got us through some very bumpy middle school days. You just can't help but smile, then giggle, then burst out laughing out loud. By the time you get to the end it's hard to remember what drove you there but you'r glad it did. My daughter, now 19, needed a lift recently so I sent it to her at college. She told me she had read it to her 5 roommates ""kindergarten style"". It's a timeless treasure!"
3,Th Blue Book review,"The book will life anyone's day. Therefore, the object was to put a smile on a depressed person with this small simple book. However, the vendor who sold the book failed to stated that there was a handwritten note on the pages of the book as thought it was a gift for someone. Well the depressed person I gave this book to found this and then proceeded to chew me out because of it. There was certainly a miscommunication of product as advertized verses the book received."
5,Guaranteed smile!,The Blue Day Book is the best way to turn a frown upside down! I bought this book for all my girlfriends and they love it as much as me!!!Truly worth the purchase!
5,This book will teach you and cheer you,"I found this book at a thrift store. It is one of those books I will want to keep. The photos really tell it all even better than the words. It talks to you on every page. It already knows how you've been feeling and what your weaknesses, insecurities, work problems, and strengths are. It tells it all and makes you cheer up and take a fresh approach to life. The photos are worth a million words. It's no ordinary little book. It no ordinary little gift book. It just one of those gems of a book to keep on your coffee table and enjoy talking about and sharing with your company, or sending to a friend who is feeling a little lost in their life. It's a great book. Everyone should have a copy."
3,A bit too childish,"I think some of the photos in this are really cute, but most of the accompanying text was just a little too childish for me. I have found many more profound thoughts to cheer me up and help me build real happiness in ""Open Your Mind, Open Your Life: A Book of Wisdom"" by Taro Gold."
1,Poor,"Anyone with 5 spare minutes could have written the text for this book - I found it very cliche - I'll admit some of the photos are interesting - but really why would you pay money this. Cheap writing should be sold cheap and ""nice"" photos dont make a great book"
1,What a waste,What a waste... This book is a simple collection of about 75 black and white photographs of animals with childish little comments at the bottom of each page. It's like an expensive greeting card. It's a shame trees had to be killed to make the paper for this silly book.
1,Wide screen lie!,This movie was in Standard Screen 4:3 format not Letterbox format as stated on box. To much trouble to get this fixed.
5,Much better!,This memory card is so much better and more convenient than the internal memory which came with the camera... I am enjoying it a lot.
3,good card not what i ordered,"i bought a 256 kodak memory card from arnies supply, and what a got was a 256 kingston memory card. otherwise i am satisfied with the product and delivery time. kingston is good. would have been 4 stars if it was a kodak card. would have been 5 stars if it was a kodak card that came with something other than just the case and the card."
1,"Good idea, but poor execution . . .","This little gem was the poor product of a great idea - something small that will hang around the neck - perfect for the gym. It doesn't require some constrictive band on the arm, and it does not require a long wire from the waist that can catch on things. But it was designed and constructed poorly. It locks up often and, as with mine now, it is just impossible to access. I say it's a pity, because when it worked it was great. Battery life was poor, but I prefer that to having to put in new AA batteries all the time. I wish that Samsung had improved this product instead of abandoning it for iPod knock-offs."
1,Not Good MP3 player,This product was ordered and had to returned it twice and finally had to cancel the order and ask for a refund.
1,Player Does Not Power On.,"I've been charging the player for 4 hours, but it still does not power on. This is the 1st Samsung product ever to disappoint me."
1,Broke after two months . No customer support,"I used it for about two months before it completely locked up and no amount of formatting, flashing or resetting the player would get it to work.I called customer support and they told me to ship it to them and they would send a replacement out in 3 business days.( I have the emails to prove it)2 weeks go by and no player, so I called customer support and they give me the run around.They make you call three different numbers and then the last one just hangs up on you.I called them back and they gave me a fourth number to call, where you guessed it, I was told to call the first number.8OI called the first number again and after 20 minutes on hold they told me to call back tomorrow.This a true story and no I wasn't rude to them."
3,"Great overall series, but not such a great ending","I've really enjoyed reading Roberts' Landry Brothers series, and I was looking forward to this last book. And while I did enjoy reading it, liked the characters and romance, I had serious issues with the plot. The issues can probably be easily overlooked by someone who does a casual read of the book, but if you're one who really gets into the plot, likes to dissect it and put together all of the pieces, you'll notice that there are things that just don't make sense. There are details and twists with the plot that don't fit together, things that just don't match. It really takes away from the believability of the story and overall enjoyment. At least from the standpoint of someone who likes a strong, logical plot. It just seemed as though Roberts didn't plan very well or make sure her twists fit what she'd already written.Bottomline - good continuity of the series, good characters and romance, but subpar plot."
3,Handy 256 Page Medical Dictionary,"Easy To Use. At Your Fingertip Medical Guide. Efficient Format. New Modern Findings. Simple, Clear Language. New Revised Edition. Up-To-Date, Covering All Subjects From A To Z.This is a small-size dictionary with not too many words."
2,stay away from the pro-form 320,If you are over 190 lbs then i suggest you shop elsewhere for a better made machine. After using this model for a little over six months the left support foot beam cracked off inside the fly wheel. When I investigated the problem I saw that where the beam cracked was severely rusted also. Cheap metal. Bad design.
5,Such a fun book!,I love this! I've bought a couple copies here and there for friends after I got a copy for myself. I love it so much! It's so cute and pretty fun.
5,HUGE and detailed,"Quickly shipped. AND I can't ever complain about Folkmanis. Another quality and detailed stuffed animal puppet. I purchased this critter for my 11yo son over a year ago because he became interested during school - in Raccoons - and this one is almost life sized and allows for my son to express himself and learn more about the wildlife around us. The price is EXCELLENT for the quality. The workability is great, the hands/paws are highly detailed and the overall puppet it is really well made. This fellow goes on car rides, and sleeps with my son. Very pleased."
2,Disappointment,"The raccoon arrived on time, but looking like it had been stuffed in a closet somewhere or on the bottom of a dirty clothes pile. The tags were attached, but the raccoon definitely looks ""used"". A disappointment. The picture showed that it was a ring-tailed raccoon. The one we received had a dirty gray colored tail. It is a puppet, but it should clearly state that the mouth is the only moveable part. It has lifelike front paws, but they just hang limply. It would've been so neat to be able to move the paws as well as the mouth. An overall disappointment."
1,Choking Hazard!!,"Purchased this for my daughters for Christmas. I think it is very cute. It IS small..but i am ok with that. After playing with it for 3 or so days the top ""nipple"" part of the bottle has come unglued. Found my older daughter playing with the small nipple part. I quickly took it away and i will be throwing the toy away. Too bad- it should be made of one whole piece of wood."
5,Fun anime...,"Much like the first collection, this DVD set complete's the previous one. I am unsure why they decided to split the anime set into 2 different 'sets'. I think it may have to do with the volume of ep's but I've seen longer anime's condensed into smaller sets. Either way, the anime is excellent and the DVD's contain some extras too."
1,Doesn't even work!,"When I opened up, it wasn't sealed. No problem, I though, so I turned it on and pluged everything in. It didn't work however, It just showed a fuzzy blank screen, weird noises, even after plugging in the ear phone jack, and only thing you can do is turn it on."
1,Big fan of Slim Jims and jalapenos but this product blows,I'm a big fan of Slim Jims and love jalapenos but this product is awful. I opened a bag at my office and several of my co-workers said it smelled like dirt while others thought it smelled like grass (the kind that grows on your lawn). The taste is bad too - sort of a combination of dirt and grass - now I I have a good idea of what a cow's life is like.
5,Simply good,Atomic Kitten is simply good...they sing live pretty well...and almost all their songs are not hurting my ears.What else could I ask for?
3,Has some good material,"I honestly debated what to write about this book, as it's one that has some good material but which I don't like at times because of its negative attitude. Why have someone write a travel guide about a region where the author dislikes or is bored by so many of the places?On the plus side, it is a nicely illustrated and organized book which does contain a lot of valuable tips."
5,Gout Books,Bought these for my Mother. We both are very pleased. Great food ideas to help control gout.
4,Gout cookbook on DVD,"Again, this information was very basic but did help us get started down the road to identifying and eliminating those foods which can aggravate gout symptoms."
4,Strong but Heavy,"I guess you cannot avoid it, if it's strong and sturdy, it will be heavy. What you need to be careful is make sure the tripod you will mount it on is just as strong. If you are using a normal tripod, the extender will out weigh it. Make sure your tripod is just as strong and sturdy.The product itself is well made and does what it supposed to do."
4,Excellent product for my food photography,"I agree with the other positive and detailed reviews of this product here. I bought this extender to help me get higher up and over for overhead photographs of food. It has worked wonderfully for that purpose and has also helped overall for getting into tight corners of my small apartment where my tripod wouldn't fit before. It is quite heavy and the screw connecting the pole to the base loosens over time, but you simply have to tighten it again with your fingers and it's good again. I love this extender so much that it's become a permanent fixture on my tripod. If you're interested in seeing the photos I take with it, you can see my photography on my food blog: www.6bittersweets.com"
3,so havy,"Rarely I will find a tripod that support it, since this is a tool so much havy. It is a great part, but so havy"
4,Nice Feel Good Movie,"I would recommend this movie. It was a nice, feel good movie for a change.It was something the entire family watched & enjoyed together."
2,movie will not play,"it will not play the warning and the preface about a total of 1 minute of music and a still picture were all that we got ,by the way ran thru the total list of troubleshooting tips nothing applied or worked ..the trouble of returning and reordering was not feasable I do not have packaging or receipt it was given as a gift to a family member it is next to impossible to find a link to contact Amazon to explain and merely request a replacement maybe they will read this review and contact me was looking forward to seeing this movie so disapointed"
1,"No English Subtitles for the hard of hearing, only French and Spanish","We really wanted to watch this movie but the soundtrack background and quality of the sound make it impossible. There are NO English subtitles. I guess it was more important for the French and Spanish speaking people to be able to see and hear this movie. For us, it was not possible (sad). We could only give it one star because we didn't get to watch it."
3,Husband loved it,Husband loved the movie; I thought it was a bit too simplistic and left many gaps in the story line. Was rather disappointed after the buildup at the opening in the theaters late last year.
5,Outstanding video .....,It's a video that everyone should see.. To bad that it doesn't get more rave reviews... Keep the kleenex nearby..
5,Absolutely Awesome!!!,"A friend let us barrow his DVD and told us that we needed to get the Kleenex out before it started. We watched it with our familly last night. We had to watch it again today with the rest of the family. We have purchased our own copy and one to lend out to others. And yes, we needed the Kleenex........all of us."
3,"Okay movie, but lacks....something (?)","When I heard this movie was coming out, I was excited to see someone actually stand up for the rights of the people that fought to call a ""Holiday Tree"" a ""Christmas Tree"". This became a law somewhere back east by a City Governor, which is totally rediculous. He actually had the audacity to put a law in place to make it unlawful to call it a Christmas tree.You can't find this movie in stores, I had to buy it online. I have no idea why.When this movie came out, it was nice to see someone in power (here it was the local mayor) stand up to a few people in town that attempted to take it away. Add in a sad story of his lost son in action while in the military and you have a pretty good story.The downside is that the movie was far too predictable, and the characters seemed to lack the true drama. It was a low budget film, so I reviewed it as such. Not a bad film, but I've seen better."
5,KEEP CHRIST IN CHRISTMAS,This is a story that everyone needs to see. Thank all those involved in bringing this idea forward to remind everyone what can and should be done to keep CHRIST in CHRISTMAS.
5,Don't be ashamed. Be courageous.,I showed this to my bible study group the week before Christmas.We laughed and cried.The story combined the rights we have to worship freely and the reason many fought for us to have that freedom.
4,fight for freedom for all - not CHRIST-o-phobic,a great example of 1 person doing what is right for freedom for all. Too many Christians allow CHRISTophobic people to dictate a slanted interpretation of the 1st amendment.
5,An Amazing Video,"If you have not seen this video, it is definetly a must see. I have ordered this video and sent it to all my family members!"
5,A Must See!,A timely message. Wake up America. This movie will inspire you and motivate you to do something...and NOW!A must see for the entire family.
4,Nice message,"If you are looking for a blockbuster movie, keep looking. If you are looking for a movie that displayed the perfect Christian family, keep looking. This family was not the picture family that attends every Sunday and Wednesday and every small group. They don't read the bible and pray. This family lost their son while he was serving our country. They were distraught and frankly a little lost. Even though the patriarch served honorably, he had even lost some sense of patriotism. He became reminded of what he believed in and finally decided to take a stand for freedom again. This movie is more about reminding us to stand up for the freedoms that are being eroded by the politically correct, than it is about Christianity. But the message is a heartwarming one. Lets remember this nation was founded by protestants fleeing religious oppression. There is nowhere left to run, so stand."
5,Let's take back our country,It was a good movie. Got to my heart from the beginning. Glad to see people standing up for God and our country.
5,excellance,The movie warrents an Excellant rating......A message we all need to hear and heed in these days and I would fully recommend every citizen or otherwise to watch.
5,Great movie.,I hope everyone will see this movie. Our citizens need to see it and know that we were founded on religious principles.
2,"GOOD RECORD GUIDE, BUT BORING BOOK","The Rough Guide to Reggae is a good resource for starting a reggae CD collection. But it's not a very good read. Interested reggae fans should probably buy it. But if you really want to know what Jamaican music is all about, Reggae Routes - The Story of Jamaican Music is the real deal."
5,More information than you can assimilate,There is wealth of reggae-related information in this book. The discographies are fantastic. It is the best Rough Guide I have yet read.
3,NOT THE BEST BUT WORTH READING,"Of the three books on reggae I have recently read this is the second best. It gives a fairly good overview of the music, recommends albums from various periods and interviews a lot of former and current stars. It's not really a book for continuous reading but rather a reference work to be consulted occasionally. Overall a worthwhile addition to the growing literature on reggae - better than Reggae, Rasta, Revolution but not as good as Reggae Routes : The Story of Jamaican Music which is definitely the best book ever written on the subject."
2,"OKAY, BUT DISAPPOINTING OVERALL","I found the Rough Guide to Reggae rather disappointing. It looks good and promised a lot but was sort of disjointed. The authors know a lot about reggae but don't really have a good feel for Jamaica. It might be okay as a reference work, but it was not a real fun read and certainly not the defintive book on reggae it claims to be."
4,Delbert McClinton ultimate collections,"I personally don't like country music, but, this ws for my brother and he really enjoys this CD."
3,Not well designed,"The quality is pretty good, but it's kind of a pain to fit over over my camera and lens. It's too small to use with my Canon 200mm f/2. It has the length, but is too narrow to fit the diameter of the lens. They should have made the lens end larger. It would not only fit more lenses, it would make it easier to put the cover on all lenses. And it wouldn't add much to the weight, bulk, or expense of the cover.It's also rather bulky, because it's so stiff.I find myself using plastic bags more than this. They are easier to carry, since they fold up small, and fit more lenses.UPDATE: I recently bought theCamera Rain Cover For Canon Models with lens combinations up to 13"" long: XT XTi XSi 5D 10D 20D 30D 40D 300D 350D 400D 450D EOS 1Ds 1D 1V K2 T2 Ti XS Rebel, and find it much more useful than the Kata raincover. Easier to pack, and it fits my Canon 200mm f/2.0. And it's cheaper, too."
5,Excellent tool for the outdoor phtographer,Use this to shoot high school and pro sports for the newspaper.Allows me to keep right on shotting regardless of the weather!
2,Not good for rapid deployment,"Because I shoot news photos, and it is wet or raining a lot here in the Pacific Northwest, I've destroyed too many lenses and cameras in the course of my work.I'm sure this product might work well for someone who has the time to insert the camera into the rain shield (in a dry environment), and perhaps use it on a tripod -- perhaps like at an out door sporting event.But, for run-and-gun news coverage, I'm still looking for a product that is fast and easy to deploy."
4,good option,"bought this to take to alaska and ended up with sunny 80 degree weather the entire time. So the little I have used this, it has worked as promised."
2,Kata rain cover,"I found the product sturdy however very aquard and poorly thought out. The model that was recommended for my Nikon just didn't work for me, you have trouble accessing your lens and controls. Keep on looking there are others out there that realy do work and have reasonable access to both lens and camera.Brad"
2,Wait for VH1-Classics,"I think that you can fit more than 50 minutes on one DVD these days. They trick you into paying $35 by putting this documentary on 3 DVDs like you're getting more.Wait for it to come out on TV, which wont be long. Try to see it though if you like Hendrix though because it's a very comprehensive look into his life and even though it was obviously low budget, another reason not to pay 35 dollars, it covers a lot with great detail and was very ambitious. Great interviews from family and girlfriends, musicians, producers, and even Jimi's old football coac)and you get a lot of perspective into Hendrix as an artist and as a person. The people that made it were obviously big fans. But its not something you'd see more than once which makes it not worth the price."
1,3 minus 2 stars,"I am giving the documentary 3 stars because there is some good interviews and tells the story of Jimi Hendrix with a lot of detail. It was well put together by the film makers. But at the same time I am taking a star away for making a Hendrix documentary without Hendrix music and another star for charging so much for a documentary that is not much longer than a regualar movie. I agree with the other reviews that it is definitely worthwhile for a documentary and as far as documentaries it is one of the better docuemntaries about a musician that I have ever seen, but c'mon a Hendrix documentary without the music."
5,"Outstanding, essential Hendrix history lesson.",These people are crazy. This is a 5 star production. I have seen it a few times and am buying it to watch it yet more. Awesome Hendrix documentary of his life and his music. Great buy!!!
3,Not bad considering the so-called Hendrix estate wouldn't let his music be used,"First, don't buy it. You can search and find free downloads on the net. This is a pretty good documentary. My main problem is the fact that the people being interviewed were not identified. Sure you can tell if it's Pete Townshend or Jeff Beck or Chas Chandler. But some of Jimi's old friends or family members, you have no clue. You have to guess who it is. Same with some of the critics interviewed.Yes, it would have been nice to have his music and concert footage included, but you can blame the so-called Hendrix estate for that. Jimi would be appalled if he knew his music was controlled by people not even related to him such as his ""sister"" by marriage. What a joke. His brother is the true heir."
2,Truth in Advertising,"Like the Box says no Hendrix Music and No Hendrix performances. They werent lying. What a bore. Some good interviews though, especially from the Hendrix family. Nice to see Leon have his say."
2,Common Sense people.,I have no clue why my professor chose this book as a textbook. I feel like a lot of what was said in the book was common sense.
3,Kindle version - hard to read!,"I'll get straight to the point. The text was required reading for me and the many examples and anecdotes were useful in understanding the nature of program planning.However, the book features numerous charts and diagrams in each chapter, and the Kindle does NOT handle them well at all. Many are virtually impossible to read. The best I could do was read the charts on Kindle Cloud Readeron my PC, and even then they were not good quality."
3,Theory Good - Practical Not,"Theoretically complete, but doesn't help practically. You can learn about adult learners, but how to develop an actual program... I don't know, it's not enough!"
3,Book review,"This book is in logical order and is well written but it lacks visual aides and clearly labeled examples. For these reasons, it appears to be incomplete and hard to follow.I will be happy to review adult education text book or manuscripts for a fee."
5,"Engaging, highly rewarding reading for dedicated anglers.","In Profiles In Saltwater Angling, angler and conservationist George Reiger shares revealing and engaging portraits of such fishing greats as Zane Grey, Kip Farrington, Ernest Hemingway, Fran Woolner, as well as modern masters Lefty Kreh and Walter Fondren.

3,18 volt li-ion milwaukee battery,"A great drill but the batteries have a very short life,especially since they are not cheap to buy.so I would give the drill a 4 star rating ,because the hammer drill works well and the drill itself has good power.I wouldn't know hot to rate the drill overall,because I haven't used comparable drills."
1,"Battery 5, Milwaukee ZERO","This is the same battery Milwaukee was selling for $54.00 3 months ago!!!First they screw us with crappy overpriced NiCads that don't work for crap, then when they finally make a decent replacement battery they double the price on us??? I will never buy or recommend another peice of Milwaukee junk, and will replace my 15-20 Milwaukee hand tools with DeWalt as the batteries die off. SHAME ON YOU MILWAUKEE!!!!!!"
2,3.0 AH Li-Ion under perform 2.4Ah Nicads!,"3.0AH Li-Ion under performs 2.4Ah Nicads!My two Milwaukee 48-11-1830 3.0Ah Li-Ion run time is 30% less than my other two Milwaukee 48-11-2230 2.4Ah NiCad batteries! All four batteries purchased new and at the same time. Go figure, should be the other way around.Plus when put on the shelf for a few months, both Li-Ion batteries goes dead while the other two Nicads still have plenty of charge left. Discharge rate is unacceptable on those Li-Ions.Also when under extreme loads such as when a drill bit gets stuck in a hole, the freshly charged Li-Ions goes dead immediately. However, recharge time is pretty good, about half an hour.Milwaukee Li-Ions are over priced as I just purchased two DeWalt 3.0Ah batteries for $100 on sale but Milwaukee has better tools, IMHO."
1,No compatible with M18 impact,I never used this product as it didnt fit my impact. It says will work with all 18 volt milwaukee tools. That was probaly true before but now it is a lie. The M18 need a M18 battery
4,What happened?,When I baught this battery last time it was only $68. Now everyone wants to charge $100 or more. For that price buy the ni-cad 2 pack at $129. Great batteries only down fall is they don't have the gauge on the front that tells you how much power is left
1,"amazon says five year warranty, packaging says 1 year","well the battery functions ok, but i did notice that while drilling 1 1/4"" speedbore through 2x4 that the battery would stop the drill several times. that never happened with the ni-cad batteries. though these batteries do seem to last longer and are quite a bit lighter, i just hope that for twice the price these last more than the dismally depressing 1yr described on the packaging. Amazon needs to update there description of this battery so its not deceiving shoppers. because the v28 battery is only 10 dollars more and says it has a 2 yr free and 2yr prorated warranty, in addition to lasting longer than the v18"
5,Milwaukee 18 volt lithium,"Lithium batteries run time is longer. If you cut something hard or if the battery gets to hot it shuts down. With ni cad batteries the tool keeps slowing down. The lithium seems to run hard then just dies, its hard to get use to that feature. However each battery has a life indicator at the back of the battery pretty cool feature. Good batteries so far."
2,BATTERIES DON'T LAST ANY LONGER THAN THE NICADS,"i just bought an 18volt hammer drill let me tell you something I'm not impressed at all. If you're buying the drill because you think the batteries last longer than the NICAD that's not true, they are pretty much the same trust me on this i tested both of them and they were both new! all you have to do is try to drill some holes with a spade bit or a hole saw bit and see how many holes you can make very simple i got the same amount of holes with 1 1/4 hole saw take or give one or two holes!I BOUGHT THE DRILL FOR THE 5 YEAR WARRANTY NOT BECAUSE I LIKED IT'PS: I'm a contractor all drills are pretty much the same right now(MADE IN CHINA EXCEPT FOR THE BATTERIES SOMETIMES) just go with one who has the better warranty."
5,Longman Idioms Dictionary,"I would highly recommend this dictionary for intermediate and advanced non-native learners of English. I have been teaching EFL since 1983.The idioms are well organised and much easier to find than in a normal dictionary. The definitions are easy for EFL/ESL learners to understand.It includes both British and American idioms.It's not so big and heavy either, so it's easy to carry around.I use it a lot when I'm preparing my free English vocabulary email lessons.Paul Snookesenglish2U.compaul@english2u.com"
1,Too expensive for an EP tape.,"I'd advice anybody to stay away from this tape, even Bronson-fans. Don't get me wrong; it's a fine little TV-western, Bronson's good as always, it's a good cast in general, but the picture quality is not very good. -But that's just a minor problem. In fact, the tape's in the awful EP mode. -And at such a hefty price, too. Very disappointing, indeed. Shame on you ""Goodtimes Home Video"", for releasing something like this, at a price the double of what it's really worth. It would be nice if ""Amazon.com"" could note the speed-mode of the tapes."
2,At least they tried,"What this is is an attempt to edit two seperate episodes of The Virginian tv series into one story. The story line of two brothers (Bronson and Marvin) and the seperate paths they took would have worked better had there been smoother editing. It becomes most painfully obvious during the final five minutes. Beyond that, if you would like to see both actors in their earlier years, rent if possible."
2,A Not-So-Wild Western With A Whoops.,"Two episodes of the old Virginian series spliced together do not a good movie make.Boo-boo in the film (warning, the following is a spoiler, of sorts: The kid does not want his father to whip him, so he shoots his father with a six-shooter. The problem is the six-shooter wasn't invented when the guy was a kid.Whoops!"
3,"Kindle Users ""STAY AWAY ""","Nice book and content, thereof, informative, etc. But the CD contents of the physical book cannot be played on the Kindle. Yes the book can be heard orally, but the musical examples cannot be played on the Kindle version. Best to buy the physical copy and hear the musical examples of the text."
3,Fair Info,"Pretty superficial if you have a basic idea of what is distorton, reverb or tremolo. If a total novice, dead on.Alan"
1,NigmaDemus,"This book is pure fodder. A waste of time. The useful nuggets could fit on two pages. Why all the blathering? A book of pure examples like the dod book is much better. This stuff is available on the internet, and that's what's bogus. It's the same old tired bunk that made us look for a book with a title like this one. If you're new to guitar and have money to burn, this could truly be an introduction to effects and tone. If you read what's available for free, this book is worth about one dollar. Spend your time enlightening us rather than informing us. Even most beginners will be left unfulfilled, because when you decide to play electric guitar this all the stuff everyone tells you, and that you read. A book of just effect chains and settings would be much more satisfying. Will these publishers ever learn?"
2,Not much useful information,A previous review says the book is for beginners but even as a beginner I didn't learn much from it. Much more detailed information is available online without even looking very hard.
5,Great book,"I have been trying to find a non complicated guide to incorporating effects and setting my amplifer for the best possible sounds.This book is packed full with information about these subjects and much more.I really liked looking over famouis guitarists rigs, to see what players like Hendrix, Clapton, Van Halen, and others used in their rig.Great book and excellent audio CD< the songs and jams are inspiring and showcase the various tones and effects wonderfully.We need more books like this one!"
1,Waste of Paper,This is one of the most confusing and poorly written books around. The book is nothing more than witchcraft and craziness. I do not recommend this book to anyone.
2,Colored Water is More Like It!!!,"There was not any [sugar] thing in this book to make it interesting or tempting. Needless to say, I am very disappointed in Ms. Berry's third novel.The book jacket spoke of two friends and their journey towards acceptance by growing in life, friendship, and faith. What we got was Adel's story about her failed marriages and immature husband; then a total thematic contradiction with Ms. Lucy and her tiptoeing on the brink of self-destruction.Call it what you want Ms. Berry-hoodoo, voodoo, or psychic energy-it all comes down toevil symbols, vampires, snakes, and séances, all makings for a story with a theme I didn't want to read about.What do you believe?.....I believe Ms. Berry really let her fans down with this one."
