2,Not my favorite Anastasia book,"Anastasia's mom has to go out of town, so Anastasia is in charge. She thinks she can handle taking care of the house and her 3 year old brother, but she is sadly mistaken. Her dad is not much help.This is the most ridiculous and sexist of the Anastasia books. Although they make a big deal of titling the housekeeping schedule ""Krupnik Family Non-sexist Housekeeping Schedule"" it is pretty obvious that Mrs. Krupnik does all the work around there and that the rest of the family would be (and is) lost without her. The happy little ending is that Mrs. Krupnik buys a microwave and therefore is better able to do all the housework. Bull. Still a pretty funny book, though. It just offended my feminist sensibilities."
5,A View From The Other Side,"This book is for those who can handle that the white man was definitely not always the good guy in the white hat. After reading a few chapters, I thought, 'and WE called THEM savages'! Written by a white man, a judge no less, Brown's book tells the other side of the story quite well. No white hats for the white man in this book!"
3,"Dog's will eat them, but not their favorite!","I was so excited to receive this treat for my dogs....guess I was more excited than they were. They will eat it, but don't go crazy for it like they do other Salmon Treats. Not sure if I will purchase again."
3,Eh,"Annabel's stupidity could be excused if she were still twelve, but she's fourteen now, for Pete's sake! Granted, she's a reflection of many fourteen-year-olds today, but still. I don't know why Lucy even puts up with her. Speaking of whom, although she is sensible on overall, there are times when Lucy sounds just as immature as Annabel.Ben was more likable when he was thirteen. At fifteen (-and-a-half), he sure is dumb. Even if he's a jock, I don't believe he should be that dumb. The highlight of the book is really Wheaties. He reminds me somewhat of Adrian Mole.Plot-wise, this book is kind of lacking. The everyone-learns-a-lesson formula is not so obvious, but still doesn't quite work. I gave the book three stars only because I enjoyed things Australian. Oh, and because of Wheaties.Rachel Cohn clearly was thinking of a writing another book on the Steps, but if Annabel doesn't grow up soon and if Cohn doesn't make Ben a bit more complex than that, I highly doubt the next book would be any good."
4,color is actually hot pink...,"bought this for my son thinking it was red as pictured. It's actually a hot pink color. Shirt is great, color is not great for a 12 year old boy :-) Would have given it a 5 if the picture was a better representation of the actual product. Shirt is a perfect, comfortable weight for layering on cold ski days."
3,"Cracking the Ap Spanish Exam, 2004-2005 Edition (College Test Prep)",A good book - but would be better with more sample practice test questions and explanations for correct answers.
2,Peruse other guides before buying...,"Likewise in the previous review, PR's review of Spanish Language AP is far too simplisitc to adequately prepare you for the AP test. I 'felt' ready, but come test day (2004), the exam was much harder than anticipated.Received a 4, only because of a unusally interesting essay prompt and easy speaking section.*Didn't try any other study guide (so you may take this with a grain of salt), but felt this one didn't do the greatest job of preparation.Purchase for basic review of verb tenses, outline of test format, mediocre coverage of listening and speaking practice.(FYI Spanish is one of the hardest AP tests)"
4,AP Assessment is usefull,As any other assessment (evaluation) book AP offers me the opportunity to incorporate questions and imitate their style to my regular classes tests. The reason behind this is to provide the same or similar challenges to the regular or the majority of our students practicing equity and validating our mission goals in our school and the School District.
1,THE CURE FOR INSOMNIA,"this book is not worth the paper it is printed on.....a total snooze fest. the author spends paragraph after paragraph describing the most inate details ....seemed like he was trying to lengthen a short story to novel length....AND it didnt work. skip this one, try one of his others."
3,Love is a Decision - 2007,"I have read this author before and he continues to have some very good principles to share. This book is very good; for the traditional couple and family that existed at least 25-30 years ago. My partner and I have been reading a chapter each week and then discussing it. We would gain so much more from this book if it was updated to current life situations. We both believe that ""love is a decision""."
5,Powerful preparation for marriage,"As my fiance and I are preparing for marriage, I decided to read this book in order to best prepare myself. The book discusses many things that have been helpful, but in particular focuses on us men and the responsibility we are given in marriage. It shows how we need to step up to the plate and be there for our wives and families, and even tells us HOW to be there for them. My fiance read a few chapters and can't wait to read it after I finish up the last 2 chapters. We are both blown away by the content. Highly reccommend it."
5,Another Gem,"I've been to a couple of Gary Smalley's seminars and have read most of his books. Some can be redundant but this was has a lot of love and wisdom that just gushes forth. Definitely worth reading and re-reading. I'd recommend just about any relationship book from Gary Smalley, Michael Webb and John Trent -- my three favorite Christian authors."
5,A Must Have,"This is the book that my wife made me read before we got married 14 years ago. She and I are now over the marriage ministry at our church and have recommended this book to many couples. I've probably bought and given about 20 copies to people over the years. We love it, and we strongly recommend it to others."
5,This is the most life-saving book i have ever picked up.,"Mr. Smalley is a lifesaver. After my wife threw me out of the house and was adamant about divorce,i knew i had to do something. Fortunately my chaplain had a copy of the book, and after reading it i will never be the same again. The jury is still out on whether or not my wife will let me back into her heart and into her life, but at least i know how to handle the situation and all the emotion involved. Thank you Mr. Smalley"
4,Very Easy to Follow,This is one of the easiest books I've read on Organization. It has guides at the end of each chapter for you to follow. I would most definetly recommend it to anyone who struggles with getting things organized.
5,Excellent!,"I love this book. I had bought it for my Kindle and loved it enough that I bought 2 copies of it in paperback. I bought one copy for my best friend and the other for my mom. All 3 of us have learned some great tips! Each of us like different things about it, but we love the kitchen planning ideas!"
3,How Housewives can organize their TIME,"This book is geared very specifically stay-at-home moms, specifically Christian stay-at-home-moms. It is focused on how to organize your time and to prioritize activities so that your house and life are more pleasurable for everyone in them. It is not for your average person looking to organize their things, or even their life, as this book really focuses on someone who is at home, with kids, and whose primary responsibilities are cleaining the house and taking care of a family. As these are not my primary responsibilities, I didn't find much in this book that worked for me."
1,Singles Beware,"I haven't finished this book yet, however, I'm finding it very ""married with kids"" oriented. I'm a single woman, no kids, with lots to do. And it just seems like all of her ""cases"" and tips are geared toward someone with a family who is willing to help out around the house. What about the rest of us? How do we get organized by ourselves?"
1,Li'l Abner 1940,The video is defective as it plays half way through then starts over from the beginning. I spoke with the producer & he advised that the master in the hands of Amazon (publisher) is probably defectiveLi'l Abner (1940)
2,Not my cup of tea!,"Sorry, I could not finish watching this. The characters I saw were really close to the comic strip the action was less than stellar."
2,"Too Little Hamlet, Too Much Else","There were a few things about this version of Hamlet that actually worked for me, having women play Horatio and Polonius among them, and having Ophelia die of a drug overdose fit in well. Some of the acting was good enough. But this was obviously a low budget effort filled with effects that struck me as pretentious and that eventually became tiresome. There were too many overexposed backgrounds, too many split screens, and too many hotel hallways meant to remind us of The Shining. Finally, there was way too little Hamlet. I understand perfectly well that any film version of Shakespeare is going to omit some lines, but this one has omitted large chunks of the play."
4,Love this tea!,I do not usually have time to brew tea but these drops make it effortless.It tastes great and you can either drink hot or cold! Great product.
3,Eh.,"These plates are OK. They're better than the dirty, old, plastic tan plates that were already there, but they look very industrial. Like they would be in a commercial building. And they are smaller than the old plastic plates. There are now gaps between the plate and the wall that used to be covered. I personally wouldn't buy them again."
2,"Service was good, the wallplate is too brittle for words. Break in the center the instant you just barely tighten the screw..",Don't buy duplex outlet wallplates unless they are advertised as unbreakable. I bought a 10 pc bag from Amazon which don't break no matter how tight you get the screw.
4,Exactly What I Wanted,I have bought several black faceplates of late wit mixed results. Finding them locally has been a challenge to say the least. These outlet faceplates are exactly what I wanted and expected. Good quality and firm glossy plastic.
4,touch of class....,"My parents had recently remodeled their kitchen, when I saw the kitchen I noticed how bad the old plate covers looked. As a present I purchased them all new stainless steel plate covers. It really upgraded the look in the kitchen, unlike other areas of the hosue you really notice the plates because they're all at eye level. These cost more upfront but the look in the kitchen was worth it. For about $40 i am really happy with the overall look."
5,Lance's performance program,"I highly recommend this book. It provides some personal information about Lance which is interesting. More importantly, however, it contains specific training advice with detailed training programs for all levels of riders. The book also discusses nutrition and strength training for cyclists with more attention to detail than I have seen in other books on this subject."
2,not this book,This book could have been super. However just by Friel's and Eddy B's. read this if you are a pure newbie otherwise forget about it.
1,Pretty terrible,Severely lacking in useful content. Terrible writing style and only seems to mention Lance to name drop in hopes of lending credibility to the very limited training in the book or to suggest you buy services. I bought the book to learn something not as an advertisement.I probably liked Lance Armstrong less after reading this because I found Chris so bloody annoying.
4,Bested in Berlin,"I read this book ravenously and quickly digested its contents. Some of the advice-- especially his commenst about cycling in the off-season-- really hit home with me. But his comments about diet-- particularly laying off the sauerbrauten-- seemed excessive.Although I achieved great results by following the methods in this book, I did not quite obtain the results I desired. Maybe next year, jah?"
4,"If it's good enough for Lance, it's good enough for me!","While most of the text of the book seems to be written by Chris Carmichael, Lance's personal coach, there are snippets of ""What would Lance do?"". These are very helpful and inspirational to novices like myself, and cover such various topics as diet to weight training. I was referred to this book by the bicycle shop where I purchased my road bike. The salesperson who helped me had taken up biking later in life, like myself. He had made amazing progress, and attributed it to Lance's book. For those like myself, who are on the steep part of the learning curve, it's good to have an accessible role model (Lance Armstrong) by means of this book. Although workouts are sketchy, each type of training is detailed, chapter at a time. I am still in base training and not yet into the seven week programs, but am looking forward to applying the workouts in my training regimen."
1,Weak at best!,"I found this book to be a big let down and a complete waste of my time and money. As a long time cyclist I was hoping to discover some new and exciting ways to approach training and improve my cycling experience. I thought no better way to achieve my goals than from the training methods of one of the best cyclist of our times, Lance Armstrong. This book is for beginners at best, even then it's rather vague in areas with too little detail. If you own Joe Friel's Training bible stick with it! Don't be tempted by the title and name of the author of this book. I guess that's that I get for buying pre-order online."
2,Bummer...,"I was so excited when this book arrived at my door, but my feelings quickly changed when I began reading. If you know very little about cycling, I would say this book is a decent choice, but for anyone else it's pretty much a waste. I was hoping to get so much more out of this book other than a nice addition to my coffee table."
3,"Good, but could be better","First, the good stuff. I beleive that the theory behind the training is valid and effective. You get a very bare bones introduction to the training method with recommended schedules and training levels, but that's it. No explanation of WHY you should train this way as opposed to another. The first 50 pages or so are useless fluff explaining proper tire pressure and turning techniques etc. that anyone buying this book already knows. Overall a good book, butI would hope that any future editions make better use of the pages."
2,Not compelling,"This was an average horror movie at best. Although only from 1999, it felt much older in terms of camera quality, etc. All i can really say is that its average. The story just lacked a compelling punch to take it over the edge. The cast and acting was ok, but not that interesting. The music was boring. The story is ok, but also lacking punch. And so it goes."
3,Pretty good...,"Well, this is an interesting anime. First off, the opening theme and entire soundtrack is done with more of an 'ancient ' Japan feel that uses voice but not words as an instrument. That turned out to be far better than I'd expected. There's also a lot of perverted humor and nudity. The fight scenes are pretty cool, but always end in a Japanese-style duel in which the victor is always obvious. Some of the plot points are awkward, such as the mentioning of characters that never actually appear in the story. Kotetsu's mistress apparently transforms into a much younger woman for most of the story, but the fact that she actually did transform is only slightly hinted at. Readers of the manga would be able to understand a few parts better, but those unfamiliar with it should be able to enjoy the anime anyway. Kotetsu makes for a good evening rental, or buy it cheap."
1,Standard fanboy Drool fest,"This is the tale of some girl who along with a woman detective get to be exploited and objectified all on one, convient, little tape *s*.What about the story you ask? It's full of many repetitive elements: For instance an ugly, dorky, perverted guy gets his jollies by either looking up someone's skirt or being in the appropriate location to see the leading female characters constantly without their clothes ( he gets plenty of frontal views of the red haired one).This movie makes several attempts at humor which consistently fail miserably. This movie is also listed as being an action adventure but fails to deliver entertaining action or adventure. If it was possible to give this title less than one star I would have done it."
5,GREAT!!!,This is a really good video I would watched it again.It has a good story and the video is drawn well also.
1,MOOD SWING/88 LINES FINALLY ON CD,"Mood SwingTHE NAIL'S MOOD SWING with the original RCA version of 88 LINES ABOUT 44 WOMEN is now available on cd. Forget about Corpus Christi. It is an unauthorized release and has been disavowed by THE NAILS. Buy MOOD SWING instead.Marc Campbell, THE NAILS."
2,88 Lines Remastered on Hotel for Wmen,"The original 1981 version of 88 Lines about 44 Women has been remastered and can be downloaded, purchased on the just-released Hotel for Women CD. It is superior to the non-remastered original version available on Corpus Christi. Give it a try! --- David from The Nails."
3,Looking for a reply,"I am familiar with the song ""88 Lines about 44 Women"" and am curious to know whether the lead singer also performed in the late '70s or early '80s with a Washington DC band called Made for TV. That group had a single called ""So Afraid of the Russians"" and I'd love to know whether that or their album ""Spies Everywhere"" was ever reissued on CD. If anyone can help, I'd appreciate it. Thanks!"
1,Disappointing,"I had looked far and wide for the original version of 88 lines about 44 women, a song that harkens back to the heyday of my early 20's. This album contains 3 versions of the song, none of which can hold a candle to the original which received radio airplay back in the 80's. why did they have to go and mess with a good thing and why not include the popular version on the CD? I want my money back"
3,Intriguing,"I too was looking for the original""88 lines"",but had to settle for The 3 versions on ""corpus.""I thought ""Corpus "" has some good songs i.e( Lets commit a sin,Simple things). ""Mood Swing"" was a far superlative album,but if the vinyl's worn out ,""Corpus"" will suffice-the sound's still there"
5,The original KROQ version of 88 Lines!,"A KROQ Fan's review is misleading. The version of ""88 Lines.."" he's recommending on Richard Blade's CD is NOT the ORIGINAL, and certainly not the version that was played on KROQ ""back in the day.""""88 Lines..."" was originally released in 1981 on an indie label (Jimboco/Citybeat). The indie version was played on the BBC in England, KROQ in LA, KITS in SF and other westcoast stations, and it's the version included on Corpus Christi.The Richard Blade version is the later RCA re-recording that was played on most of the eastcoast radio stations in 1983 (like WBCN in Boston). (Incidentally, WLIR/WDRE in NY played both versions.) So, technically, CORPUS CHRISTI DOES CONTAIN THE ORIGINAL VERSION...and most definitely the KROQ version.The rest of Corpus Christi sounds like the third Nails album it was intended to be. Dark, gothic... Not for everybody, but damn wicked."
1,The Nails - Corpus Christi,"The 88 lines about 44 women is a cute, interesting song, and is why I bought the album. The rest of it is just aweful, though."
3,My Vampire Loser,"The quickest way to sumerise this - if you like Jim Bacchus/Darien Cain films, then you'll love this.I don't, but I appreciate that this is a better film, if only because these two have less to do with this film - Jim's moved to producer role, & Darien has only a small role in this - ...If you like women with fake boobs (there's one here who looks like she's upsized), and a succession of mild and poinless lesbian scenes, then this is for you.Our poor heroine is a bit of a loser, she screws a bevvy of women, drains them, then has an angst session about it.The finale confrontation is the only laughable moment of the film, and that's unintentional"
3,wouldn't recommend this movie.,"The scene's are weak..story plot is sucking wind.I've seen teens who didn't know what they were doing,act better than this."
3,Great Sets: 7 roadmaps to Spectacular Quilts,I was very dissapointed that Ms. Craig didn't include the pattern for the quilt on the cover but after many tries I figured it out for myself. You buy a book on line by its cover.
5,Easy to make decorative frames,Decorative Frames from the Crafts Library is a very good book. The frames included in the book are nice and very practical and the instructions to make each frame are very easy to follow. I would highly recommend this book for begining Crafters.
3,"So so, grip","The grip is ok. I have found that they only last a short time, about two months. I will be looking for one that meets my needs and is more durable."
3,French Record purchase,"This is an excellent record that we purchased for a friend who left the country. It would have been five stars, but the CD arrived with one corner of the case broken. We didn't have time to get a pristine copy."
3,A french record?,"I love the McGarrigle sisters and I've read fabulous reviews of this CD, but I was a bit disappointed honestly. For my taste there were about two or three beautiful tracks, and the rest wasn't quite my cup of tea, though perhaps it will grow with repeated listenings. I used to live in France and maybe my idea of French music doesn't quite correspond to this."
5,yes indeed,"juicy live blues cd! starting off with sam myers and anson funderburgh. sam on the harp and that voice that makes people turn their heads and go towards the stage. anson makes the guitar a part of him as he puts out riffs and solos that leave you in awe. both ron levy and grady gaines put on a good set. a nice variety of blues, makes you wish you were there when they recorded it."
1,Contains WHEAT & SOYBEAN OIL?!,"Seriously, how does a baby cereal touted as a good choice as a first baby food contain these big NO-NO ingredients?! How can it be labeled as ""single grain""? There's no reason ""oat flour"" should contain wheat... I bought this thinking I could avoid supplementing with probiotics & dha... should have read more closely before purchasing.. Forget it, I'm going back to simply grinding up my own oatmeal.. sick of over paying for 'baby' cereal anyways..."
5,"Great Product, but hard to find.","I love this oatmeal, and so do my kids, but recently its been harder to find. Wal-mart in all their infinate wisdom removed it from their shelves at our local store when they did their last store makeover. You can get it at Target, if they have it on the shelves. Since I found it on Amazon I just buy it by the case. My 1 and 2 year olds both love it for breakfast and I think its way better for them than regular oatmeal. I hope amazon never stops carring it. :)"
1,Not environmentally friendly!,"Unfortunately, Gerber is using tuna oil as a source of DHA. This is very bad for the environment - tuna is severely over-fished and people should not really be eating tuna at all. They should switch to a plant- or algae-based source of DHA. Until then, I suggest that you avoid this product if you care about the environment. By the way, a fish-based source of DHA does have a higher chance of being contaminated by toxic chemicals like mercury. This is one of the reasons why people seeking higher DHA levels in their diet have switched to plant-based sources such as flaxseed oil."
1,Not Vegetarian,As a previous reader commented this product does have gelatin in it. I called and Gerber said the source of the gelatin is pork.
3,Good product but NOT VEGETARIAN.,"This was the first container of rice cereal that our baby has tried. He took to it very well, and I thougth buying the DHA formula cereal was a smart choice for his development as opposed to the regular.Unfortunately, I realized just as the container was almost gone (and I had already bought another container) that this product has tuna oil, as well as gelatin in it. It is the source of DHA. It's my fault for not reading the label more closely, but I really would have never guessed that a single grain baby cereal would have fish oil in it! The formula we use also had DHA, but it is algae-based. Just wondering why this has to be from a fish. Gross."
2,Not such a Big deal,"Disappointing sequel to Monicelli's superb original, but amusing in parts, not a complete misfire. It is wonderful to see Mastroianni and some of his cohorts reappear, but the zing of the original is missing. Shame Claudia Cardinale and Carla Gravina don't make a comeback here. It may improve with repeated viewings so I will keep the DVD handy."
2,Don't be mislead!,"Don't be misled. If you are a fan of Aquarium Rescue Unit and think Jazz is Dead is for you...Be warned. Jimmy has a brand new bag...and it stinks. For those of you that love Jazz, don't expect to find any here. Unless you are a dead head searching for someone to fill the void left by Jerry Garcia's death...Jazz is dead is not for you. Save your money and give your favorite Miles CD another listen."
2,doesn't do the job,"Thought it would give my fingers and hands more grip, but it didn't do that.I think this product is for hands and fingers that are sweating, as in when the moisture makes some things hard to hold on to.For dry hands that are slippy, another product will likely be better but I haven't yet found it."
3,Is it really aluminum?,"This muffin tin is nice looking,but heavier than my other aluminum trays from Wilton. No where on it was a mention of material content or that it has a non stick finish. We'll give it a try and re-review it at a later date."
4,Works for me,"Cooler is well made and appears durable. Product shipped quickly. Plenty of room for meals for a 12 hour shift worker. I did not receive a water bottle with it. I like the cooler but will give the company a thumbs down for not sending entire contents of purchased item, and I will not buy from them again."
4,Great,I like the cooler back pack I would twick it a little bit so far as a couple more pockets but other then that it's a Great! Find for me
4,A Beefed Up Lunch Box Solution,"When I purchased this, I was looking for something larger than my conventional insulated lunch box. This pack easily lives up to that requirement, and more. There is plenty of storage in the main insulated area, enough space for lunch for several people. Beyond that there is a handy place to drop your water bottle in. There are several other outside pockets for all kinds of purposes. I normally pack my lunch, a twenty six ounce insulated thermos bottle, a Kindle, and various and sundry other pieces of equipment. It is not perfect, I would like a little more space on some mornings, but for most of time it is a great solution. I would heartily recommend it to anyone looking for something slightly more commodious than their current lunch box."
4,Rugged Backpack,"My wife picked this up for me as a daily lunch carrier since I tend to carry books and other items besides my lunch. It was a bit larger then expected but since I work in an art field no one seemed to make fun of it since some of them carry truly strange things. Although it's larger then I'd like it is good for what it is and therefore I recommend it.Pros:Rugged, thick canvas.Strong zippers, though plastic.Thick insulation.Plenty of zippered pockets.Large capacity.Good for a day trip on the trail.External bottle carrier.Cons:Cheapest water bottle ever made. Leaks. (You'll be replacing it.)Velcro on small side pockets is worthless. Should be magnetic snaps.Pocket inside main compartments lid is very awkward to use.Main flap has small velcro strip. Not a secure fastener."
5,I love this backpack!,"I have the olive green backpack which is an awesome neutral color; it looks good with brown & black. I bought it for a 4-day trip to San Francisco. I used it as a carry-on @ the airport, and I took it around during the day while I explored the city. I love the water bottle spot; I used that the whole time. (By the way, the package says that a water bottle is not included). The side pockets provide perfect, easy access to my cell phone & camera. The top zipper is great for snacks. I like that the bottom of the backpack is reinforced- it provides durability and makes it easy to clean. I used the key hook on the side the whole time, also. By the end of my trip, my friend had me carry her dinner leftovers since i had this insulated backpack.I love this pack because its features are truly smart & practical. It's very comfortable. I can't wait to go on more trips. Especially, I can't wait to take this to the beach. I think it'll make an awesome beer cooler:)"
1,missing strap,"it looks bigger than the pictures, which is a good thing. it is always better to have extra space than not having it. my only complaint so far is that the shoulder strap is missing."
1,leaks!1,"i was so pissed when i got this cooler, filled it with ice, and it completely soaked my car seatwhy cant anyone make a soft sided cooler that doesnt leak?"
5,Great Books,"Children of Gebelaawi is one of the greatest books of all time. Naguib Mahfouz is a writer with a profound understanding of the human condition. This book is a history of the world, an analogy of the lives of great religious figures from Moses on up, a moral history of immense proportions describing the strengths and weaknesses and foibles of humankind. Recent events in the Middle East render his balanced voice even more poignant. It is so sad, so ironic that he was attacked by fundamentalists a few years ago."
2,Lone Hero?,"This has got to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The only really good thing about this movie was Lou Diamond Phillips. Admittedly, the only reason I picked this movie up is because he is on the cover. I came very close to turning the movie off, it was just sooo ridiculous."
4,Lone Hero,"This film, common to most biker films, plot was actually done in true formLot's of action, explosions, stunts & a little western action as well. Kept my interest to the end."
4,The Wild One crossed with 3:10 To Yuma,"Standard story of a biker gang taking over a town, the story starts with bikers robbing a bar and injuring the bartender. The bikers tell everyone in the bar that if any one tells who committed the crime, the gang will take revenge on them and their families. - Some one did not listen; you know the rest of the story.Lone hero is an entertaining, low-budget variant of ""High Noon"", a modern day western featuring bikersIf you are looking for a meaningful cinematic experience don't bother you will be disappointed, if you're looking for an entertaining shoot 'em up, this is for you.To bad drive ins are a thing of the past, seeing Lou Diamond Phillips portraying a villain with a sense of humor on a huge screen in an out door setting would have been a real treat."
3,Not bad for a low budget movie,"Lone Hero - Lou Diamond Philips is a pretty good ""bad guy"" in this movie. Plot is a little weak, but fun to watch anyway."
3,Good for intuition and interpretation,"This book, is like having a physics proffesor tell u what is Quantum Mechanics, ""Forgets your a newbie Student"". It tries to bring u the basics but relies on prior knowledge of it ?! Allthough it is updated (unlike older QM books) and gives you a good perspective of the theory. The first 3 chapters are clear more or less ( Still with prior knowledge ) but the rest relies on very advanced knowledge. Not a good book to start with. Usefull if you have firm foundation of Quantum M. and want to contemplate the interpetation of it."
2,Another book about nothing...,"First of all, I had a feeling that i was going to purchaseuseless book. I just wanted to prove my theory and wastedmy money on it. Well, it's good to be a writer these days...Pick up some hot commercial name for the book, add a little bitabout everything and here you go - you've wrote a book aboutWeb Services! It's packed of some web links and some discussionof XML and SOAP and everything else what you can find in the kit from Amazon. All in all, don't expect to find anything usefulin this book. All you need is the kit and some examples from the Web. I'm planning to donate my book to the local library.good luck!"
2,"Out of date, not useful for non-programmers","I knew going in that this would not have much use for me... that's okay, one tidbit of information could pay for the book many times over.What i got was a rehash of the now ancient history (2003) versions of Amazon Web Services, and nothing useful from a pratical standpoint.I didn't expect to use the programing stuff (non outdate), but thought the author might throw in at least one example of someone useing this goldmine for a functioning task.I'm giving a 2 stars because it doesn't have some of the promised programing discussion, but recomend anyone looking to market books, etc to avoid this one."
3,Useful for beginners,"If you've never been exposed to XML or SOAP and using web services then this is a good book. However, it is by no means a comprehensive treatment of the subject. The reality is that if you download the SDK and spend a little time on the internet you can find all of the same information."
5,A good practical introduction to web services,Amazon Web Services provides good readable information; readers who have limited background in working with web services and the technologies involved will benefit. This is a great way to start learning about web services in general and Amazon Web Services in particular.
1,Hoy en dia cualquiera saca un disco.,"Hoy en dia cualquiera saca un disco.Despues se quejan los de la industria que estan mal, si siguen sacando cosas asi van a matar a la musica!"
1,Luis Miguel wannabe's - Tacky,"I think Luis Miguel its unique, by history, talent, production, composition, arrangements.After hear this CD I found that sounds Tacky and Cheap and the songs are really outdated for today's times.Luis Miguel es unico, por historia, talento, produccion, composicion y arreglos.Despues de escuchar este CD, lo encontre ordinario y de mal gusto, pienso que las canciones suenan como antiguas."
1,decepcionada,Sinceramente tengo que decir que esto es lo peor que he escuchado ultimamente en el genero.Su voz en llanto y las espantosas canciones que contiene el CD son insoportables para mis oidos.
1,Too Cheezy for me,"Too Cheezy for me, the songs on this album sucks. Cheezy & Cheap.need to say more?"
2,DeWitched!,"Stick with the original EWP, it's a great parody with some lovely ladies (especially Katie Keane a.k.a. Laurie Wallace) She's the best.....which is more than I can say for this DVD. If you could rent it somewhere go for that or find a dummy who bought it and borrow theirs, it's worth watching once...but if you own a Pioneer DVD player it may not work! It would not play on mine and all DVDs play on mine. There's a glitch with this Witch!"
2,Not what I was expecting,"I was very disappointed with this book. I wanted to use the ""meditations"" in this book for a church retreat I'm planning and felt that most of the prayers/meditations were rather sophomoric. There is one or maybe two that are lovely and I feel I can use, but I hate to have purchased the whole book. I'd get a hold of a copy and look at it before buying if I were you."
4,"excellent, though a bit highbrow","Found this book a bit heavy slogging in the middle, but really enjoyed the first and third parts. Wish she'd spent more time on Part One The Female Presence Today, but instead the majority of the book is Part Two on the Figure in Myth that spiraled into dusty details beyond my interest. That said, however, the writing is erudite, the scholarship superb, and the attention to the forgotten goddess figures all around us was just what I was looking for. Highly recommended."
2,Clean up is difficult and time consuming,"This will produce a quesadilla with just the right crispiness and is very easy to operate and inexpensive, however the clean-up is a pain due to the metal plates having so many grooves and raised surfaces. Additionally, the quesadillas it produces are quite thin with little filling. It is not possible to make a thick, heartily filled quesadilla. If one tries melted cheese will run out and spill on the counter top. Worse yet the melted cheese and grease will go in between the bottom metal plate and the plastic housing with no way to get it out except when it is stored on end (one of the advertised features) upon which the cheese and grease will then run out and onto the shelf or cabinet it is stored in."
4,Henry Fiol,"A delight, New York singer, arranger and composer Henry Fiol has a great voice. I cannot speak Spanish so the lyrics are entirely impenetrable to me. But the music and singing are wonderful. Their is a brittleness to the recording which gives Fiol's voice a tremendous clarity and penetration. The playing is clear, clean and joyous. If you love Salsa you will love this. Highly recommended."
1,popper a complete dud,"We were very excited to replace our old popper with this 6 qt fancy-pants popper that promised movie style popcorn. Only thing is, we tried it twice and it took over TWENTY minutes for it to pop a few kernels. And then it stopped and simply started to scorch the popcorn until our fire alarm reacted to the carcinogens. Obviously, lots of advantages to air popping as it doesn't include the requisite palm oil that microwave popcorn does, but this product is right up there with x-ray glasses in its many uses."
5,The other great record by Richard and Linda,"This is guitar playing and songwriting at their most menacing, and they well serve their purpose: this is great music about the bitter end of a love affair. This is the perfect soundtrack for two people falling out of love with one another. Don't let this scare you, though--this is sublime stuff. But be warned: this is not for the faint of heart; this music will sweep you to your feet. Once again, Linda's voice is a perfect plaintive counterpart to Richard's droll humor and jagged guitar playing. This is as good a record as was made in the 1980s."
1,Don't buy this on DISC!,"If this were a proper transfer it'd get five stars because this is indeed a great album, which is why I wanted to get a copy on disc as a backup to my lp. Well, the mix on this disc is awful. Thompson's voice is often placed far back in the mix and does not represent the songs as I've been listening to them for years. In fact, sometimes certain song elements seem to fade in and out for no apparent reason. Another reviewer said the Rykodisc Gold was a better version on disc. If that's true, then go get it, but don't get the one I did: Hannibal HNCD 1303."
2,nothing special,"I read that this was the ultimate break-up album of all time. It's not. I don't think it's a break-up album at all and it's certainly not the ultimate anything. The album is OK, but that's it."
1,Bad buttons,"I have four of these handsets, and two of them have many buttons you have to really mash to get them to work. I would not recommend them. Perhaps latter versions have fixed this issue. If it were not for the bad buttons, this would be an excellent phone."
5,Perfect addition,"My husband and I love the phone, so much so that we purchased another one for our newly finished garage. Good clean sound and works well. Never had a poblem with them, so when we needed another extension for my husbands garage - the choice was easy."
4,"Great voice, bad buttons","Great phone, good distance, excellent voice quality. The only problem is the buttons seem to have ""worn out""."
5,I love this phone,I had to replace 2 of my extentions because the keypads wore out. I love this phone. It's well worth the money. I'm sorry Motorolla has decided to manufacture only cell phones.
4,Intro to Judaism,"This is a really good book for anyone to get a general understanding of Jewish religion, its different movements, and its culture. I read it for a class I'm taking, Contemporary Jewish Literature, and it was a great introduction to the Jewish culture so that we can better understand the novels we're reading later. Goldman does a good job giving all the details of rituals and holidays without bogging down the reader. He also describes how many variations there are in the way Jews live out their culture without holding one movement above the other."
4,Fun stories by some new names to watch.,"Any anthology will have big names for marquee value-Fred Saberhagen here-but the reason to read them is to get a first glimpse of new talents you'll be seeing again, and this is a great collection for that. The idea of a SF/fantasy anthology themed around the prom is a kick, and these writers rebuff what you might call the ""Carrie syndrome,"" the stereotype of bookish types that never got invited to their proms and can only think about it in terms of bitter sarcasm and bloodshed. There are some gently funny and truly sweet stories here. Be sure not to miss Jenn Coleman-Reese's ""Memory and Reason"" in particular."
2,*JUST PRETEND THAT I AM MASHING THE KEYBOARD...ANY ATTEMPT TO CREATE A WITTY TITLE FOR THIS REVIEW WOULD BE WASTEFUL.,"Oh my goodness, I hated high school. Haha. Oh dear. I am SO glad that the nightmare has ended. This book was dreadful, a mess, a wreck, a disaster, a farce...the editor should have aborted the concept after the 1st tale. Haha. Oh, dear Lord, this is a terrible book. What a great reminder of the undeniably ludicrous and insignificant nature of high school. The prom. Haha. This book is a collection of every single reason that I didn't go. Hahahahaha Nancy Springer, you really REALLY tried, but this was plain silly."
1,Don't waste your money,"There were one or two enjoyable stories in this anthology, but most of them were a waste of time. A few were actually offensive, with done-to-death or tasteless themes, senseless endings and improbable situations."
1,Save your hard-earned cash,"These stories were ho-hum, nothing new or innovative. A few insulted our intelligence in this household. Better you should read the Heinlein juveniles over again--they're not really for kids. Or go find something by Connie Willis; she has collections of stories that are worth your time."
2,Beware,"The picture shows a 1 gallon bottle but what you get is 1 quart.Otherwise, the product is alright but I can get it from Lowes for the same price."
3,Neutral Buoyancy,"Book was well written. However,this book is more on the histroy of Scuba Diving from way back. Not what I would expect from it's title. If one wants to know the history of the spunge divers in Tarpen Springs, once again this is a good book. This book was written by a man that is posesed with sponges and the history of Scube. Little to no action. and the bugs on Long Island in the Bahamas are over whelming.If these are what you want to read about it is a good book. I was looking for some good infomation on diving in todays era. and maybe some action.NOT IN THIS BOOKIt will sit on my shelf and not be read like others I have read 7 or 8 times.Please Note, I am a scuba diver that has reached the level of Instructor, I know the sprot."
4,Excellent but....,"This is an excellent book, but be advised that it loses it's way occasionally. It has a little too much history about diving and not enough narrative, to my tastes. It is not quite as good as Water and Light - the best diving book I've ever read (though I have to admit to not have read that many) and a great book overall - but well worth reading. Another note of warning... it can be an extremely frustrating book if you are not going to be able to dive in the near future - so either read it right before a dive trip or be prepared to call your travel agent to arrange one after reading this book."
3,Not one of my favorites,"This book has two types of narrative: history related to diving and personal experience. I enjoyed reading the latter and not the former. Also, I found his style rather wordy. It's not one of my favorite books related to scuba diving. Others I enjoyed more were: The Last Dive, Shadow Divers, and Deep Descent."
3,Maybe Stories Better Told in Person,No doubt Tim Ecott has a treasure trove of diving experience and subject matter knowledge and while reading his book I kept thinking these stories and historical anecdotes would be much more interesting confined to retelling in person or by the author via radio. The book itself is a meandering collection of stories without drama or other particularly compelling reasons to keep turning the pages. I'd love to tune in to the radio show where I'm sure Mr. Ecott does a better job at probing the depths of his passion than the shallow retelling in these pages.
3,Kinda boring,"Can't say I loved it. I was expecting more thrilling stories about scuba diving, but it's more of a history of underwater exploration. Not that there's anything wrong with that, but it's not written terribly well either. There's a whole chapter on sponges; this is not riveting stuff.You know what bugged me for some reason? When he talks about those old-school diving helmets with portholes in them and guys pumping air from the boat - you know, like from Tintin? - he visits some guys who still use them, but he doesn't try it himself. Why not? Jeez, dude, get in the game."
5,Neutral Buoyancy,I have just purchased my second copy of Neutral Buoyancy because I gave my first copy to the Manager of the Central Caribbean Marine Institute. This book is a must read for anyone who dives or is interested in the sea. Each chapter is prefaced by a dive story which either moved me to tears or laughter. I learned so much from Tim that I just had to get another copy of this wonderful book. Thank you Tim!
5,Awesome Book,"Neutral Buoyancy by Tim Ecott is a very good diving book. Ecott gives a fairly detailed history of diving beginning with the ancient Greeks. He lightly discusses how diving effects a person's body (changes in pressure, decompression sickness, etc) and explains who the major contributors to diving were (nations and individuals). Scattered throughout the book are some of his personal experiences while diving.The book isn't designed to be technical. Instead it's interesting to read about the developement of the sport and Ecott's personal feelings towards diving. This book is well written, reads fast, and has great entertainment value. I read this book before I was certified just out of curiosity, and it motivated me to enroll in open water class.Two thumbs up."
3,To Live,it was just an ok movie. Rather drawn out at times and lacks attention getter. I would rate it as Fair.
5,"Sad and noble, and full of hope","To Live is the best Chinese film I have ever seen. It gives a wonderful view of modern Chinese history, with as honest a perspective as can be hoped for. It is honest about the hard times the Chinese have faced in recent years, but without the bitterness one often finds in narratives of this period of Chinese history. The sadness of the film was wonderfully portrayed -- strangely sad and hopeful. This is a film that invites multiple viewings. If you liked to be challenged by what you watch, buy this DVD."
4,Powerful piece that depicts the struggles of survival,"To Live takes place mid century in China just after the second world war. The story line follows the Xu family and the hardships that befalls them up to the late 60s and early 70s.It illustrates to what lengths people had to adapt and convert to in order to survive under Communist rule (especially during the cultural revolution). Old friends and even family had to form divisive lines between themselves in order to save themselves from possible prosecution.The acting and the interactions of the three main protagonists Li Gong, You Ge and Deng Fei are masterful and stirring. To Live is as good a film representing this time period as any other. Definitely an epic on the same plateau as Farewell My Concubine"
2,Disappointment,"This film completely butchers, rearranges, and rewerites an incredibly moving novel. I suggest that you read the book first."
5,A foreign film you will never regret owning,"This film is perhaps one of my favorites of all time. It is nothing short of beautiful, tragic, inspiring and extremely involving. If you are looking to add a classic to your foregn film collection, this picture is indispensible. Even for those of my friends who are not really into subtitles, it is always greatly enjoyed and well-received by all. Don't pass this one up!"
4,Excellent portrayal of working class chinese family,"This is a director who can portray the essence of Mao's china and the cultural idiosincracies that would be lost if he did not take the chances he has as a filmaker in Communist China. If knowing more about our world is important to you, we highly reccomend this movie."
4,Another Gong Li and Zhang Yimou success,"This film follows a couple's life from pre-communist era through the Cultural Revolution - a span of 3 decades. It shows us how these political upheavals affected the lives of the average person and what their daily life was like. The film delivers the powerful message of having to endure whatever life throws at you in a masterful way. Fine performances by Gong Li and Ge You. As usual, wonderful storyline and cinematography by Zhang Yimou (Raise the Red Lantern and Curse of the Golden Flower)."
5,to live the movie,i enjoed the movie.the movie came in great condition.delivery was on time. must see movie to see what life was like in china in the 1930's and up
5,SUBLIME,I dare anyone to find something to not like about this drama. I-N-C-R-E-D-I-B-L-E !!! 100 out of 100 stars !
3,Worth Watching...,"I'm a Gong Li fan, so naturally I'm watching all of her movies. Although I've enjoyed some of her other ones more (like ""Zhou Yu's Train""), I enjoyed this one more than some others as well (like ""The Story of Qiu Ju"" and ""Ju Dou""). It educates the viewer about several decades of Chinese history while focusing on one family's experiences through life. The viewer can either relate to the characters as husband & wife, and/or mother & father, and/or children & siblings. The viewer may also relate to some of the characteristics/emotions on display--like one's submissions to and obliviousness during addiction, one's willingness to sacrifice for others, one's guilt for not being able to do better by your family or for your family, one's sorrow after another's death...the list goes on. Overall, it's a good movie, and I'd watch it again."
5,Have kleenex handy.,"Wonderful movie, moving and poingant. Wonderful for classroom use in a World Geography or World Lit."
5,One Of Tosh's Most Well Rounded Albums,"This was Peter Tosh's first album off Rolling Stones records. Although it contains 4 recuts from older Wailers tunes (Don't Look Back, I'm The Toughest, Soon Come, Dem Ha Fe Get A Beatin') Tosh gives a new sound to them all. The famous duet with Mick Jagger kicks off the CD being the biggest hit on the album. Every song following it is a wonderfull additiion to the Tosh repretoir. The title track Bush Doctor is a great Ganja anthem. And the beautifull Creation ties up the whole package. This album continues Tosh's militant trend he established through his first 2 albums which is the reaon many prefer him to Marley. This is a brilliant I recomend this to any reggae fan."
5,EP demystified,This book is a must if you're trying to learn about EP - scientific reduction at its best.
3,Electrophysiologic Testing,Difficult and dry reading for the layperson. The Handbook of Cardiac EP by Murgatroyd is the best EP book I have seen yet. It has wonderful illustrations matched with tracings and easy reading for people other than the EP doctor.
2,Ayala's Angel,"I love Anthony Trollope's stories. When I ordered Ayala's Angel I thought I was buying the standard size paperback. This edition is larger (7x9"") which is less practical to carry around and the printing is of poor quality, smudged and sometimes hard to read. I'm going to stay away from this type of paperback. But the story itself is a great portrait of an idealist, a dreamer in situations unlike any one could find oneself at present. But then, Trollope is a wonderful escape into a world of romance, harsh reality and limited possibilities for women. And you can't beat the good ending."
1,Looks totally diffrent,"I looked for one particularly looking like this one on the picture, received white one you can buy everywhere for $4. PUT TRUE PHOTO."
4,Sakura Wars....,"Sakura Wars... a great anime, a great game. But... only 4 freaking episodes? The ending to the thing was horribly abrupt. But, that's the only backfire. So otherwise... enjoy!"
2,Sakura Battle?,"well what can i say? as anima goes this one one is just not that great.the characters are very generic(tuff girl,cute girl,girl with problems... blah blah)the animation is not bad and the voice acting isnt either the main problem with this peice of work is the story.What story? all these characters get together form a team to defeat the evil demons and...well thats it.they have ONE battle and its over.after 120 mins we get to see them form up to fight against the evil once?if this was the first part in a several part series i might have ranked it higher, but it seems to be a stand alone. think of it like watching the first 5 episodes of robotech and stoping there.no conclusion ,hardley any character development, very little action...hardly any story.stay away from this"
2,At least as interesting as an hour in an iron lung,"Ok, was I the only one who noticed the terrible job that ADV did of mixing the dub in with the music and sfx?(perhaps only on the DVD version) At times, just to hear what was being said, I had to turn this one up so loud that the music damn near deafened me when it kicked on. Other than that, not bad, but a little too cutesy for me. Somewhat interesting twist on the mecha type anime, but if it's mecha you're after, get Evangelion or Gundam way, way, way before you pick this little stinker up."
2,Not so hot,"Not so hot.I didn't feel the effects of Dong Quai, and I was disapointed; because I was really looking for Dong Quai to help me with my hot flashes. But no, it did not."
2,What?,"The only thing I have to say about this movie is that the sound quality is so poor that you can have the volume up all the way on your TV and still not understand what the people are saying. Putting that aside, the story itself is not very interesting either. The front of the video looks like it is a comedy, however this movie is not funny. The story, 2 lovers - they have an open relationship, one has AIDS and dies, He comes back as a ghost to haunt his lover, preventing him to have any more one night stands."
4,Simply entertainment...!,I figured it sounded like an interesting way to kill a couple of hours.... I enjoyed it more than I thought I would... I found it entertaining enough to sit through it without pausing for a restroom break.. And that's saying something..!!!
2,"An uneven film about AIDS, love and ghosts","Simon and Mark, a gay couple living in London, have an open relationship. Mark is a drag performer living with AIDS; Simon his his lover who sleeps around. When Mark passes away, Simon quickly removes every aspect of Simon from his life, tossing his clothes, boxing up their photographs and hiding Mark's AIDS quilt piece in the closet. This does not sit well with the spirit of Simon who returns to wreak havoc on Mark's string of one-night stands.The film as a whole is uneven. It kept jumping from being a movie about AIDS to a ghost story to a comedy to a drama to a soap opera, and was never quite able to hold my interest. The acting is marginal and sometimes overly melodramatic so I never really liked the characters. Add to that poor sound quality (I had the volume almost at full tilt but could still barely hear much of what was said) and a graininess to the film, and the movie veers away from its potential."
4,Must-read for anyone in quantitative finance,"The book is a collection of survey articles. Many of them are top-notch and exceedingly useful. Some of the topics are a bit off-beat, and relatively unexciting to me. Some of the topics+author pairings are extremely well chosen.I found around five to eight of the 23 chapters to be weak. The remaining are excellent surveys. The book is dated 1996 so the material is late 1995 to early 1996 vintage.The relevant chapters from this book are required reading for all my Ph.D. students."
1,Dumb,"Horrible Acting from the lead guy, and very dumb writing. I only made it through 1.5 episodes before ejecting in disgust (it was the scene the two investigators struggle to figure out where a guy might have been thrown off a building from. They both look at each other as the idea dawns... ""The roof!"" DUH! Maybe it got better, but I wasn't waiting around."
2,review,Am happy with video at this time however the plastic containing the box set was broken upon reciept.
5,csi fan,i love csi and work 12 hour night shifts which lends very little tv time. getting the dvd's all at once and being able to watch them at a convenient time for me is fabulous. ordering from amazon was quick and easy. thx
4,"Lacks extras, but still a great dvd for a great show","CSI is an excellent TV show. It strays from the usual police drama formula to focus on the people who solve the puzzle as to how crimes were committed. It rarely goes into the characters' personal lives, rather it goes into the crimes more. Many of the crimes are based on real cases, and the way the CSIs solve the crimes show that any piece of evidence can play an important role, and the clues can go into microscopic depths. The characters are likable, and some of them have certain morals that make some crime scenes difficult for them to solve without getting emotionally involved, which is also something educational about being a CSI. The DVD sports some fine picture and sound quality though its nothing spectacular. The extras consist of just bios, a brief music video and a short featurette which isn't very much. Still, CSI is a great tv show that is in a class of its own, and that makes the DVD worth purchasing."
4,People Lie... But This Complete 1st Season Never Lies!,"I heard a lot of good reviews, not just from critics but from friends regarding about C.S.I.: Crime Scene Investigation. It was showing in Malaysia 2, 3 years back and I never watch a single episode of it... until I bought the 1st season.All 23 episodes, all the characters involve, all the stories and all the great things that is worth getting and to begin with is this season. I am hook, and will be hook for upcoming seasons... and this is where you should start off with.Not much featurettes... but the best thing about it? This season never lies... go grab this season now."
3,"Great show, but....","Although CSI is definitely one of the best shows on television, this dvd is a little bit of a letdown. It's bare bones as far as extras go (which is not taking advantage of the dvd format as far as I'm concerned). There's no subtitles (I'm not deaf, but what if I was?). The price is almost twice as much as any other season of a network television show (most others range from $40-$50). I still think it's a great show, but they could've done a better job. If you really wanna see it, rent it. UPDATE: DO NOT BUY THIS. They are re-releasing this in the coming months with extras and in anamorphic widescreen format (like they did with all the other releases) so SAVE YOUR MONEY and buy the set they should've released to begin with."
5,Excellent show.......,"Simply, the best show on T.V. Each seaon is great and now you can watch your favorite episodes anytime you want. You'll get 24 episodes in the first season, including some of the best of the series.PilotCool ChangeCrate 'N' BurialPledging Mr. JohnsonFriends & LoversWho Are You?If These Walls Could TalkAnonymousUnfriendly SkiesSex, Lies & LarvaeI-15 MurdersFarenheit 932BoomTo Halve And To HoldTable StakesToo Tough To DieFace Lift$35K O.B.O.Blood DropsGentle, GentleSounds Of SilenceJustice Is ServedEvaluation DayThe Strip StranglerAll GREAT episodes."
5,great set,"this is a great set, the first year this show started is wonderful! i'm adding this to the other seasons i already have, to make my collection complete!"
5,CSI Rocks!,I purchased the CSI Complete First Season DVD Set for my wife as a birthday gift. We're both CSI fans and have watched all the broadcasts since they first aired on CBS. Last fall we moved to a location where over the air broadcasts and cable are unavailable. And we're not desperate enough to spring for satellite service. The DVD's of CSI are a godsend. Being able to watch all the great first season CSI episodes without commercials is as good as it gets. We'll be purchasing all the subsequent CSI season DVDs as well. It's a great deal for CSI fans!
1,Fishborne was NOT in season one,"Someone screwed up, fishborne was not in season one. Redo it, get your facts straight before listing. That is false advertising."
3,Fantastic !,I am a keen fan of American shows (and Las Vegas !) and this has to rate as one of the best and most interesting to come to our shores in a long time. Storylines are believable and the methods of detection fascinating. Brilliant cast.(...)
4,"Great show, but...","CSI is my favorite show and I realize that it's really gruesome, as the seasons progress, but there's just something about it that keeps drawing me back week after week. I just recently bought seasons 1-3 on DVD and I was really excited to start from the first epsiode and slowly work my way through each of the seasons(seeing as how I have to watch the old episodes on Spike and I don't know if I have caught every episode or not).When I watched the first episode of season 1, however, I was surprised at how grainy the picture was. It looked like they hadn't even bothered to clean up the picture before putting it on the DVD.It's an amazing show, has some cheesy lines that you just have to laugh and shake your head at, but I think they could've spent a little extra time fixing up the presentation of the DVD episodes. This grainy aspect, however, shouldn't stop you from watching it...it's still a show to check out. In later seasons, the show gets even better."
5,Great Show With A Wonderful First Season,"A friend got me hooked on this show earlier this year, in the third season, so I hadnt seen many of the older episodes. This set is great- it includes the best season of C.S.I. This show has great, quirky characters, dark humor, interesting forensic information, and intriguing whodunit plotlines.The best episodes are definitely:The Strip StranglerAnonymousSex, Lies, and LarvaeI-15 MurdersPledging Mr. JohnsonFahrenheit 932Blood DropsEvaluation DayCool ChangeWho Are You?To Halve and To HoldSounds of SilenceFace Lift"
3,"No subs, no buy","I can not understand what people at CBS were thinking when releasing this with no subtitles at all. I wanted to buy all seasons available as a present for my sister, who can't understand spoken English, so some kind of subtitles, preferably Spanish but I would have settle for English subs, were a deal maker or breaker for me.I know, I know the latest seasons released do offer subtitles, but what am I going to do? Have my sister watching the show halfway on?Hence, no subs, no purchase on my part. Not the smartest move, CBS, don't you think? Do you know how many sales you lost because of that stupid decision?"
5,Very good,"This was an engaging show. But what's really interesting is what I found after looking up another crime/murder show, BONES. This episode, 'Pilot' has the same name as the first episode in BONES, also labeled, 'Pilot'. It was just slightly funny to see that. I'm assuming that CSI was before BONES, so I wonder if they did it in almost a tribute. Because really, how many murder shows have season 1, episode 1, labeled as 'Pilot'. Awesome show, but not recomended for those who are scared easily! :)"
3,Excellent TV Series - Pity about the DVD,"There's not much you can fault with the CSI series. Clever storylines and most of all, an excellent cast (the very reason CSI: Miami will probably not make it past 3 seasons).The DVD however is surprisingly lacking for many reasons.1. Not in 16:9 ratio2. No subtitles (ironic since the lead character is almost deaf)3. Hardly any special featuresStill - the series itself overshadows a lot of this. I'd still recommend it."
1,This is the number one show on television?,"Based on how popular this show has become, I gave CSI a chance, hoping it would show me what all the hype is about. I must say, however, that if this is the number one show on television, I'm scared by the public's lack of taste. CSI, is without a doubt, one of the cheeziest shows I've ever seen. It makes MacGyver look like a compelling drama. If the ridiculousness of the storyines don't zap all energy from your body, the over-dramatic special effects will. As for its popularity, I'm guessing the show must have somehow captured ""Walker:Texas Ranger""'s old fan-base."
1,"Please, this show sucks!!!!!!!!!!!",I don't know why people are so cheerful about this crap. This show is crap. It hurts my head watch only 10 minutes of this show. This show makes detectives look like girls. There are so much better shows on TV. Please.
2,CSI the First season.,"CSI First season is very good, but it would be a lot better if all the episodes worked. I have looked at the first 4 disks and there were 4 programs which broke up and you could not watch them.Since I live in Thailand returning the set was not an option., but I am very upset that apparantly no one tested the discs prior to them going on sale.This will be my last video purchase here at Amazon...."
4,A great crime series,If anyone out there has anything negative to say about CSI..Well I just don't believe them. I can't imagine anyone who doesn't appreciate Gisham =]
5,CSI is awesome!,"I really like this show. If you like mystery and crime shows, CSI is definatly for you. Its interesting and seems fairly real, although there are many things that would not be true to life. I hope you buy it!"
4,"Love, love, LOVE it!","I have really become a big fan of the series, as I enjoy solving puzzles. I recommend it highly. My only complaint is that they included character profiles of everyone, including Brass and Greg Sanders, but not of George Eads's character of Nick Stokes. Otherwise, this is a total treasure!"
4,The first and best CSI,I only gave it 4 stars because I think the series got better as the show went along and by season 2 it was the best thing on TV and in my opinion becomes a 5 star series. Still my favorite show on TV!
3,The early shows were the best,"I have watched every CSI episode, and reruns, since it began. It's interesting to watch the early episodes and watch them solve cases without all the technology they use today. These older episodes focus more on solving crimes than they do now. Every time I watch one of the older episodes I realize how much I miss Grissom. I do think the quality of the DVDs are lacking. It would have been great if they could have produced them in high definition."
3,"Great series, but the packaging is horrible","If I could split up my ratings, I would give the series five stars and the packaging only one star. (When you're looking at buying a long-running TV series, packaging matters a lot.) CBS and Paramount should be ashamed of themselves for releasing a TV series with such poor packaging. I received several seasons of CSI, CSI: Miami, and CSI: NY as gifts and all of the ones I've opened have had the same cheap plastic packaging. Half of the plastic wraparound sheets (that make up the inner packaging) were cracked or shattered. The discs are also EXTREMELY difficult to get out--to the point that I fear that I'll break the discs before getting them out. It just seems like the manufacturer went for a neat appearance (yes, the layered plastic looks spiffy) and forgot the main purpose of DVD packaging. I'll probably end up buying a CD/DVD binder and throwing out the packaging. (For the Trekkies reading this, the packaging is worse than the ST:TNG ""green box"" set.)"
4,CSI needs subtitles,"DVD boxed set of CSI season 1, very high quality DVD video. Hardly any difference on a HDTV. Sound does not really work well, the dialog is rather soft together with no subtitles, the story can sometimes be quite hard to understand. ""Please add in subtitles in future releases"" is all I ask:)"
3,Luthers Works,"This was a gift. My son is a Lutheran Pastor and he needed :Luthers Works ---Pauline Epistles/1Corinthians 7, 15 for his library."
2,I.K.U. pretentious!,"This film was suppose to be a artistic ""destructuring"" of pornography, sex & technology. Instead, it just comes across as cheap, pretentious & involuntary comical. Also the film was booed at the Fantasia fest. Maybe it warrants a rental but not a keeper!"
5,An outstanding piece of crime fiction in a superhero setting,"Brian Bendis has a great grasp of pacing and character development inhis storyteling, and they shine through here. Powers is the story ofthe police officers charged with investigating crimes related tosuperpowered individuals; in this book, the death of one of the city'smost beloved heroines sets off massive amounts of mourning and anintense search for the killer. The dialogue is superb, parcelling outinfo in just the right amount, and Michael Avon Oeming's art is verygood as well, setting the mood and tone of the story. Plus, the tradepaperback includes sketches, a copy of the script to issue one, andsome other goodies. (At the moment,... this book listed as achildren's book. That is decidedly not accurate.)"
4,Superhero detective story,"The Powers concept is to write a detective story, with normal human protagonists, but with a twist: superheroes exist in the world. The target audience is the adult (or at least older teen) market; the stories are gritty, and action sequences are sparse. This story, reprinting Powers numbers 1 through 6, details the investigation into the murder of Retro Girl, the world's pre-eminent super-heroine. The strength of the story is the characters; the leads (the detectives) are great. The mystery itself (with requisite big revelation at the end) is only so-so."
3,Good but not Incredible,"""Who Killed Retro Girl"" is a good. The story, of two ""normal"" detectives that are assigned to investigate the death of a superhero, is interesting and generally well told, although the plot could have had more depth. The art goes very well with the writing style and is great. I'd recommend it, and look forward to reading the other books in the series, but do hope they live up to the full potential this idea has."
2,Tiny and boring!,"I got this product secondhand for $1.50 and boy am I glad I didn't buy it new at the full price! My daughter was 9 months old when I got it and sat next to it, hitting the baseball with her hand and ignoring the bat for about 5 minutes then moved on. When she was 11 months old and could walk she was already way too big for it and just ran around the house hitting things with the bat. The ""adjustable height"" only adds about two inches. Even if she was tiny enough to use this, I doubt hitting a ball in a circle with some annoying repetitive phrases would interest her very long.Save your money for the Little Tikes Little Champs Sports Center or Fisher-Price Brilliant Basics Baby's First Baseball. I don't own those but they look much better."
2,Too short...,"This was a gift to our son at 13 months old. He couldn't walk yet, but he was already too tall to really play with this toy. He has to kneel down or sit if he wants to play with it.The voice on our unit is kind of muffled and hard to understand. That aside, it's annoying to us that it only says 3 or 4 things over and over again.This toy is a dud for us. Even when we try to play with it to catch his attention, he is not interested. On the rare occasion that he does play with it, he hits the ball with the bat or his hand and the unit wobbles or tips over.I do think this toy might be good for a baby that has just mastered the ability to sit on their own. Perhaps around the 6 month age range."
3,Way too small for a small two year old,I would like the product for a nine month old because it is durable and would be very enjoyable. My two year old liked it but he had to sit on his knees to play otherwise it's a neat toy.
1,Oh No!!!,"This toy comes up to my ankle!!! It's so small, my daughter who weighs 15 lbs & is 12 months it looks too small for her!! It's really pretty boring, she doesnt really like this one at all!!! It holds her attention when the lights light up but, I get sick of playing with it... hehe i'm always playing with it to get her interested!! Not good for any age!!"
3,Item should be for 6-12months,"I purchased this for my 2 year old son, thinking the adjustible height would be big enough. However, the ""arm"" only adjusts approx. 2 inches. My son had to bat down at the ball and pretty much just used the bat to destroy the unit. I would recommend this only for a child younger than 12 months as my friend received this as a gift for her 15 month old son and again, it is too small for him as well. The lights and sound/music are a nice option, but for a younger child."
1,Should have checked the dimensions before buying,"Son is 15mo. and has very little interest in this toy. Even at his young age the toy is very short and can only be adjusted by approx. 1.5"". The toy often tips over if he swings at it and the sound interaction (single, double, triple home run) has nothing to do with how far the ball spins around."
2,"Toy too small, toddler tires easily of it",Carefully read the dimensions of this toy. It is extremely small. So small in fact that our 1yr is already too tall to play with it. He has to crouch down to swing the bat at the appropriate level to hit the ball.
5,My Grandson loves baseball,I purchased this item for my grandson's birthday and he loves it. I like it because the ball stays right there so he won't have to chase the ball all over the yard.
3,SO SMALL!!!!!!,"WOW! I was not expecting this toy to be SO SMALL! It goes up to my 1 year olds waist! When he hits it, it falls right over. However, he does like the sounds and lights. It is cute, but I would recommend this toy for a much younger child, maybe a crawler that can sit and smack it.."
3,It's Just Ok,"My son is named after my favorite baseball player, so he has received many baseball toys as gifts. This one was my least favorite. It looks adorable, but gets VERY OLD VERY QUICK! I don't mind the toys that makes noise, but this was just really annoying. My son of course liked it a lot more than I did, which makes me happy. The ball is just not stable enough to use with the bat, so he put it to other uses, and just spun the ball around on his own. It is already in our box to donate, this will not be one of those toys that I will hang on to for him, for when he has children."
2,What a Waste,"I purchased this toy for my grandson's 1st birthday. I thought it would be great for enhancing his hand/eye coordination, but he took little interest in the toy. He was already much too tall for it. It is not very sturdy becasue when he hits the ball, the tips over. It does not keep his attention. Almost a year later and her barely plays with it. Overall, its no fun!"
3,OK,Way to small i thought it would be larger so my toddler prefers to stomp on it instead of trying to hit the ball. It works better when he is sitting not standing since it is so short.
5,Swing & Score Baseball,I bought this for my 9 month old grandson. My 2 year old granddaughter seems to be playing with it more !!!! However my grand son has learned from watching her. All I hear is laughter ! Daddy seems to enjoy it too.
2,Not appropriate for over 2,"This product would be wonderful for my son except it is TOO SHORT! They advertise it is appropriate for up to 36 months, and my son just turned two and a half. The height adjustment is a joke, only lifts an inch up. The bat is too small for him too. If it lifted up higher and was more steady when hit it could have been a great toy. He enjoyed it for the first couple days and that was it."
4,Fun For Boys & Girls,"This is a very cute, fun toy that not only can be for toddler boys but can be for toddler girls. It is adjustable to different heights to toddler and so much fun for the little child. There is a fun loud ""announcer"" that makes this toy fun for the child. ""Play Ball!!"" & other fun announcements.I fully recommand this toy. You will smile and laugh as your child haves fun."
3,"Works well, but a bit dangerous","This warming tray works great, and literally saved my Thanksgiving! I love the feature that allows you to unplug the tray, and have it stay work for a few hours. However, I do wish it had some sort of rim, because it is very easy to burn yourself, either from transporting the tray, or even bumping into it while it is on your counter. It's not hazardous or anything, but you just have to watch yourself around it. The stainless steel tray came scratched up, and Amazon gave us a 10% refund. I'm so glad we didn't return it because our porcelain dishes scratched it even more during the first use. What really matters to me though is that it works, and will hopefully last. It is also HUGE, which is what I was really looking for."
1,dead after 18 months; warranty only 1 year,"I bought one of these Oct 2009. It stopped working after 18 months (power and ready lights come on but no heat generated). Which seems pretty poor service life for such a simple device. Also, contrary to Amazon's web page the warranty is for only 1 year."
4,Good Warming Tray,Just have to be a little careful with the hot plates. Great for keeping food warm and hosting! Work as advertised!
2,Not happy,"I was not happy with the product, the power cord did not work I had borrowed one from a friend and bought one we were having a large dinner party, and the new toastess power cord did not work, so I had to keep switching one off to plu the other one. I should have sent it back but decided I would just search for a power cord elswhere instead of shipping back, could have been just a fluxe but nevertheless it was a pain."
2,poor service,"The TWT-40 warming tray works as advertised and was used at many gatherings at our house. That is, until we lost the cord. There is no on/off switch, so you must unplug the unit to turn it off. The plug was lost and Toastess International would not respond to several attempts to contact them. They have absolutely no useful customer service. My advice is if you buy one and have problems; just throw it out."
4,gift,"shipment was made within 2 days of placing the order, very fast service, and the tray is beautiful. It was tried out on Xmas day and worked very well."
4,works well,Does the job well and performs as described. Easy to use and looks nice. Good value. I highly recommend it.
4,Food Warmer,I used this for a party and it kept the food warm. The cordless feature is good as it can be moved to another room or even outdoors.
5,Great Warmer!,"This was exactly what I was looking for... something large enough to hold several dishes, but small enough to fit on my dining room table. It is attractive and contemporary looking, heats up fast, and retains heat for over an hour. Can be used with or without the cord. Easy to use. Only downside was it mentioned that you must be careful when placing dishes on it because it can scratch, and it does, but it is still a great product and keeps food warm for over an hour. Would highly recommend it!"
4,Works well,"Heats quickly, stays warm unplugged, as advertised. We use a power strip with it to have a convenient on/off switch when it's just the 2 of us, but can remove strip & cord to serve guests so they can move all around table easily. Spills mostly clean up easily using ice to scrub if tray is still hot, but surface can be scratched more easily than I expected."
3,just what I needed,"It is heavy enough so it doesn't get pushed around on the table, I like that. It stayed warm about an hour. I'd have given it a 5 star rating if the on/off automatic switch would have worked. I have to remember to unplug it. If I could have found my receipt I'd have returned it for one that worked. It is what I needed though and I still like it and use it all the time."
2,Toastess TWT-40 cordless stainless warming tray,"I purchased this stainless warming tray about ten days before I needed it for a party. It arrived on time - but with a big dent on the surface, very visible, even from a distance. What a disappointment! It was too late for me to send back. This is the first time I've been unhappy with the quality of a product ordered through Amazon. I honestly think that the shipper was aware of this large ding; there was a lot of packing material; it seemed well-protected within the box. The surface of the tray was covered in a thin sheet of opaque foam-paper; I believe that it was wrapped after it was damaged because this foam-paper had no dent or mark at all. I feel duped!"
4,Can be used plugged in,"I just bought this item after reading other reviews and wanted to add information I was looking for at the time. I was concerned about it only staying warm for an hour - most parties last longer than that. I was pleased to read in the directions that this can be safely used plugged in over an extended period of time. The unit cycles itself on and off to maintain the proper temperature. It also can safely be used with a proper extension cord. Three 11X7 glass dishes fit on it with room to spare. Two llx7 and one 9x13 fits, but more snugly. The unit itself is very heavy. I have model TWT-40 and the cord does come off. Hope this info helps! Only reason I am not giving it five stars is because I have not actually used it for a meal, but I have had it plugged in and it got hot quickly. I see no reason why it won't be perfect for large gatherings and family get-togethers."
5,We use this every day!,"Don't save these warming trays for company ... we use one daily even ""just for us"" since my husband hates cold food. Now the whole family eats a little more slowly and our family meals seem a little more civilized! One caution -- we inadvertently left one plugged in overnight and blew it out, but others have lasted now for several years with frequent use."
4,Works great for Shabbat,"I bought this to use on Shabbat, the Jewish Sabbath when cooking is not permitted. I am using the tray as an electric blech (I also have it on a timer to conserve electricity), and it works GREAT! I took hot food out of the oven Friday before candles, placed it on the warming tray, and covered it with kitchen towels. The food was still piping hot when we ate 2+ hours later. Even better, the tray warmed refrigerator cold food to pleasantly warm-enough-to-eat on Saturday. I placed the dishes on the tray at about 8am, and the food was warm for lunch by about 12 or 1. My approach to halacha may be different from the norms in your community, so please take this just as ""been there done that"" advice, and consult your rabbi re: halacha. I can't comment on the product's durability, etc, since I've only had it a few weeks, but I am thrilled with how it works so far. It fits 3 9x11 pans easily."
5,handsome piece,It is exactly as it looks. Really nice piece. About the size of a half-dollar so slightly larger than I'm used to wearing. The compliments are many.
5,Om and Celtic Knot Charm,"I received this as a gift. It is really a nice size, not too big. I wear it everyday as it reminds of being one with my breath, feeling grounded and connected to all........"
3,3.5 stars- interesting electropop proposal,"I bought this album after continuously seeing a Miranda video on MTV in Mexico. Their music seemed very fresh and interesting. The album is pretty good, but not a unique, different proposal.The musical arrangements of some of the songs sound premature and a bit underdeveloped. Some of the songs make me feel as though I am listening to a new wave pop band at a high school party in the 80's.Interesting proposal, but in my opinion, there is still some originality missing. Maybe they'll accomplish this in their next album..."
1,cheap casio keyboards find a new home!,"This is a great CD, if your are about 10 and sponge bob is your idea of a role model."
5,Tammany Hall Scores Big!,"Tammany Hall's debut CD was well-worth waiting for. For anyone who has seen the band's club dates around New York City, you know the great sounds this CD offers. For anyone new to Tammany Hall, be prepared for an entertainment blow-out. Tammany Hall's sound is at once both brand new and simultaneously as comfortable as an old friend. Steve O's range as the lead singer makes every number ring. The bass work of Aron K comes across on the CD the same way it does on the club dates: you can literally hear his enjoyment and entertaining enthusiasm jumping out at you. Matt's lead guitar and Joe's drums combine to make every cut special. If you buy only ONE debut CD in Y2K, make it Tammany Hall's Getawayland. In fact, pick up copies for your best friends -- it's something you'll want to share ... and they'll be thanking you for it all year."
5,Gold Record waiting to happen....,"Non parlo molto bene in inglese e cosi scrivo in italiano...ho sentito questo cd e' per me era musica come se dice in inglese...meravigliosa...i tink you say marvelous..allora, avanti...spero che vengono in italia... i will be the line the first for biglietti... tickets..ne ho comprato uno e voglio ordinare 20 per regali...bravo e ci vediamo a ROMA..."
2,Not original,"Got this as a gift from a friend. Steve-O strikes me as a decent singer/songwriter; however, don't believe the (band's) friend's reviews/hype. The music is not bad by any means, but this is not a new, innovative or even ""original"" band. Think Matchbox 20 mixed w/Third Eye Blind--these guys would do a great cover of 'Jumper.' Anyway, not bad for a debut... but I prefer the original bands."
5,"I loved the album. My favorite song is,""Under My Tree""","I loved the album. It is my favorite CD. My favorite song is ,""Under My Tree"" I love it so much that I memorised it word to word. In my family everyone loves N SYNC. They are the perfect singers. If you do not like them, I suggest you go out and by the albums. Then I think your opinion will change. My favorites are Lance Bass and Justin Timberlake. Who's yours?"
5,This is one CD I don't mind my eight year old listening to!,My eight year old just loves these guys. I must admit their tunes and dance steps are catchy. I really appreciate the fact that these guys can sing songs that don't have to include vulgar language or use obscene body jestures in their dancing - thanks guys!
5,N sync are absolutly wonderful!!!!!!!!!!!,"This Winter Album is absolutly wonderful and so is n'sync!I love the song ""U Drive Me Crazy""soooo much.I also liked the new version of ""I drive myself crazy"",which is called ""Thinking of You"". The Winter Album deserves 5 stars all the way!!!!"
5,Works like it should no signal loss,"This thing works exactly as promised. I had to unscrew the bolts on one end to be able to use it how I wanted. Its on a powered monitor splitter converting the male end into a female end that can receive the rgb cable input from the cpu.Mine is actually yellow. It works great, I don't have any kind of signal loss (that's noticeable) and it was a good value."
1,Never shipped my purchase & never responded to our inquiries,"I purchase 2 items from this seller and never got my product and with requests to the seller to ship me my items, I never even could get them to respond. They just took/stole my money and did not look back! BAD SELLER! You have been warned!"
4,Does exactly what it says,"Works perfectly, solid construction and very low profile, dirt cheap.. Shipping cost more than the product itself!"
5,Original recordings,"A wonderful introduction to Iva's world. Each song is wonderfully written and recordrd and, unlike another review points out...these are the original versions and NOT re-recorded.There are NO Man Of Colours tracks as Iva felt they were too new at the time and deserved to be heard as a set and not broken up for inclusion on a greatest hits package.Any Icehouse purchase is worth it."
4,Down Underated,"When Icehouse began showing signs of American commercial breakout, ""Great Southern Land"" appeared. Originally released in 1989, it collected 10 songs from Icehouse's hefty catalog and added one new cut (""Touch The Fire""). It's interesting to hear how the band went from being a rather basic 80's synthpop band (""We Can Get Together"") to Iva Davies' solo collective ala Roxy Music or Steely Dan (""Hey Little Girl""). Davies' greeting card to his home continent, ""Great Southern Land,"" is also much more interesting than the corny ""Down Under.""The import version of ""Great Southern Land"" sports more cuts than the out of print US CD, and also replaces the overdrawn remix of ""No Promises"" with the album version, to the song's benefit. Fans of 80's music like Roxy, Fixx and Ultravoxx would do well to seek this CD out."
3,I don't think it deserves 5 stars,"This was the first romance novel I have read in all my life and am a little disappointed in it. This book didn't captivate me, it really didn't hold my attention or kept my interest. I mean I wasn't forcing myself to read it, but while I was reading it I couldn't concentrate on it for more than 2 chapters at a time and felt my mind start to wander. It's not a bad book, I've read much, much worse I just wouldn't rave about it and I certainly wouldn't give it 5 stars. I think 3 is fair."
2,'Charming the Prince' is charming and clever,"Different!!! If you're looking for something charming, cute, clever, witty, and downright funny, then 'Charming the Prince' is your read!! Not my usual read, but I enjoyed 'Charming the Prince's' much different scenario."
2,charming the prince,"I am a huge fan of romances. This was my first book by this author, and frankly, I was disappointed. The dialogue was predictable without being funny or even sexy. I am AMAZED that this got five stars by so many readers. Its historical charm (as has been noted by several reviewers) is poor at best."
2,Not a 5 star book,"Maybe I am just not into Romance novels. What ever it is I can honestly say I don't think the book deserves raving reviews. At least I wouldn't give it 5 stars. It's not a bad book, it had it's moments. But overall, it's not a book that I would strongly urge someone to read. I gave it 2 stars because that's what I think it deserved."
5,Historical Romance at it's best!,"Looking for a new kind of book to read, I picked up ""Charming the Prince"" at my local bookstore. As I do with all books before buying them I read the Prologue... and to my surprise, I found a seat in the big bookstore and kept reading!! I was 6 chapters into the story by the time I left the bookstore!!The story is enchanting and the caracters make your heart melt! I simply could not put this book down! This book was the first Historical Romance I ever had the pleasure of reading, and it got me hooked! I recommend it to anyone who is bored with modern romance stories. My copy of this book in paperback holds a place of honour in my library! A must read book!"
3,Shallow but sweet,"It's a sweet romance, in the typical vein of romances. A bit shallow, but I like the multiple fairy tale tropes woven into the story. For fans of romance and those looking for a funny, light read, I recommend it."
4,Charming review,"I liked reading 'Charming the Prince'. I read it straight threw and will look to read other books from this author. The reason I didnt give the book five stars was toward the end it became a little unbelievable. For example, Spoiler, he finds out she's been kidnaped and doesnt leave right away. I felt there was too much discussion going on and not enough action. He then doesn't take his men to help look in a search but he allows his children( oldest one is 13) to come along and help search. I also like reading books were hero's are more alphas and gruff. Where as this hero was not, but that's just a peronsal opinion. All in all, I like reading the book it was light and funny and worth the buy."
1,Absolutely Silly,"I have to admit, I wasn't a huge fan of Medeiros' before reading this book but I was willing to try one more of her books. I am even less of a fan now. This was one of the most ridiculous stories I've ever read. The premise was interesting and could have been great but the ""warfare"" between the father and the multitude of children was just TOO ridiculous. I don't mind suspending believability, but this book took it way too far. I found the love story aspects were simply overwhelmed by the silliness of the vast majority of the pages."
5,The best!,"Just the story idea alone is fantastic, but then written by the wonderful Teresa Medeiros makes it a true winner! Our hero has outlived many wives and has a huge brood of children making his life hell. enter our heroine, who at first wants to run but over time, wins the hearts of the hero and his children. I loved it! Classic, tender, funny romance."
3,"A cute, quick read","No real tension. No real character development. But a cute story. Not something I will re-read. Check it out of the library, don't buy it."
3,"Very cute, but not her best","I LOVE Teresa Medeiros - truly I do. But this book, for all it's poignant scenes, didn't grab me as much as some of her others. The love scenes lacked ""closure"" for lack of a better word. Not enough of them, and if they were trying NOT to have a baby then they weren't doing it right. Plus, if I read the name ""Mary"", ""Margaret"" or ""Mary Margaret"" one more time I thought I'd go nuts!"
5,"In one word -- perfect!! The man, women, kids and laughs.","First, I must state that I read this book in only a few hours (because I couldn't put it down)and that this is the best Teresa Medeiros book I've read. I have enjoyed them all but only this one made me laugh out loud at Bannor's children and his response to them. I also liked the way that the author planted the seeds for a future romance between two of the characters. Lastly, I would highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys romance mixed with humor because with ""Charming The Prince"" you get it."
1,A Waste of Time,No effort to make it even halfway historically correct. Silly interactions between the characters. The premise sounded good but the opportunity was wasted. Was supposed to be funny but was just dumb.
3,a very enjoyable read,I really enjoy this authors books. They are always full of humor and tenderness. I lookforward to each one.This one is the story of Lord Bannor who has a dozen children who are driving him nuts. He decides that they need a new mother and sends his steward to get him a wife. He comes back with a new wife alright but one that Bannor can barely resist. She is the beautiful Lady Willow. Lady Willow has been treated by her stepmother and step siblings like a servant. She is thrilled to get married and away but soon finds that all she is to be to her husband is a caretaker for his children. She sets out to change this and inlists the help of the children.Bannor cannot resist her and even though he fears making her pregnant wants her very badly. The love scenes are tender and make one want to sigh.I enjoyed this book very much and would recommend it to anyone who wants a light read for a rainy or sunny afternoon.
4,TOO CUTE!!,This book was just tooooo cute. Its a classical idea with a twist. If you like the Sound of Music and Cinderella then you'll love this. After reading many of her books I have to say this one has the best twist!
4,Charming the Reader,"This is the first Teresa Medeiros book I'd ever read. I was unsure what to expect, and found myself pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed it! Medeiros doesn't spend too much time developing lurid sex scenes, but instead they're rather tastefully done. And the writing is funny and delightful.Medeiros does lean a bit on fairy tales, I've noticed, but she plays with them, and mixes them around a little bit. This story starts exactly like any Cinderella story you might read, but moves far beyond that into a charming world of Teresa Medeiros's own making. I found myself laughing and crying -- sometimes simultaneously. Medeiros has certainly found an avid fan in THIS reader! Her writing is too delightfully charming -- excuse the pun -- to even attempt resistance."
2,Great potential. Next edition should be a blockbuster.,"The text gets 5 stars for the orientation, organization, and the on-line resources for the text. It describes exactly what you would want in an Applied Corporate Finance course. Unfortunately, I have to deduct 3 stars because the text contains too many typos and smple calculations which I specifically want my students not to make. This has been frustrating for my students, as well as myself. However, I am confident that when this problem is cleaned up, the book will be among the best Applied Corporate Finance text in the market. I strongly recommend a new, corrected edition."
2,Too elementary for any real users except new students,"The book covers a number of concepts in a broad swath; while the new finance student will get a decent overview with some applications, seasoned users will get the standard fare dished out in elementary finance texts. Not recommended for anyone with working knowledge of finance."
3,ok,"Four love stories from four of the hottest romance writers of today that center around Della's house of style. If you are a fan of Rochelle Alers, Donna Hill, Felicia Mason or Francis Ray, you will enjoy their short stories included in this anthology."
3,It was okay; could have used better editing,"Where was the editor? The situation of one story struck me as highly improbable. Another proudly mentioned ""Shriver's Row"" (should be Striver's.) Incidentally, mentioning these two blocks must be considered hip, every story except one either had characters living there or with office space there.Entertaining stories, but a second pair of eyes before publication never hurts!"
3,"Save your money, borrow the book","Four good writers from this genre but this anthology is weak . The best story is Felicia Mason I give this 4 stars: Truly honestly - a reverse Cinderella tale, rich middle class woman and working class man.A dilemma often spoken about in the black community but deals with this very well in this short story.Second best I give 3.5 stars - Donna Hill It could happen to you. The story of the owner of the salon Della. Good to read a story about love in the middle years!The rest 2 stars and 1.5 stars - Sweet Surrender/A matter of trust pretty average Cinderella type stories especially a A matter of trust had the most annoying simpering heroine.All in all a missed opportunity, the only consistent character was Della, each story seemd to have different staff working there which surprised me and no mention was made of Della's husband after the first story."
5,4 Great stories,"I must admit that this book was just as good as Rosies Curl and Weave. All the stories were good. I really enjoyed the first two stories the best, but the last two were good also. They were funny and could make any girl wish she worked in that shop, and just maybe a good one will come your way. Well if you haven't read this one, then go and get it."
5,A style of it's own,"I bought this book because it's a sequel to ""Rosie's Curl and Weave"". I wasn't disappointed in the book. Although, they are short stories they are very well written and has enough of a story line to hold your attention."
3,LIGHTHEARTED FUN,The tale of a hitman who picks up super powers that let him x-ray everything and read the thoughts of others. He starts by dealing with the fallout from the mob but the real focus is when an alien race employs him indirectly to assassinate the Joker in Arkham Asylum but Batman tries to stop him. This is mostly a lighthearted action piece that doesn't take itself too seriously. You should not either. ARTWORK: C plus; STORY/PLOTTING: B minus; DIALOGUE/CHARACTERS: B minus; OVERALL GRADE: B minus; WHEN READ: end of December 2011.
4,A very Solid Anti-Tip Solution,"I like these better then sticky tape and strap based solutions. I feel that they will hold much better in case of an earthquake or a climbing kid.A tip for installation. Be sure to separate the brackets from each other to take a reasonable amount of slack out the cable. It is not a big of an issue for the inch, but I used some 7 inch version and they could allow furniture to tip pretty far out before they would ""catch""."
5,Another great purchase,"This book arrived in New Zealand well packaged, undamaged and in better condition than I expected for a second hand book. My only gripe is probably not the fault of Amazon. Every purchase via Amazon takes an incredibly long time to arrive in New Zealand. Amazon do give an estimated delivary date but I fail to see how it can take 3 to 4 weeks to post items intenationally."
5,Excellent book for chiropractic students,"I used this book along with Mosby's Physical Examination book and easily passed my Physical Diagnosis class in chiropractic college. These two book also served as excellent references for Parts II, III and IV of the national chiropractic boards. I also found Dr. Leonardi's National Board of Chiropractic Part II Study Guide: Key Review Questions and Answers, to be an excellent source for the boards. I also found Leonardi's Part III Study Guide and Part IV study guides to be right on the mark. These books helped me with passing the boards. Bates Book is needed as a great building block for learning Physical Examination--Heart, head and Neck, Chest and lungs, abdomen etc."
4,Awesome Fragrance!,This fragrance from CK is simply amazing... my wife just loved it! Definitely a great gift item for any occasion...
1,Not worth it,"Beautiful prose, rhapsodizing over African scenery, written by a woman with the time and money to indulge herself in a trip to Africa. I was able to overlook some of the dated, what would now be considered politically incorrect, references and observations, but her matter-of-fact admission, about a quarter of the way through, that she has to beat her little dog, took the sheen off her so-called love of the animal kingdom. This is the only book I have ever thrown in the trash can."
1,This movie really sucks,"this movie really sucked, i don't know why anyone would buy or rent it but it was given to me on accident. the special effects could have been better done by a small child. i am fairly sure they used a cap gun in all the shootings, the acting was horrible, i have seen grade school plays that were far more impressive. don't buy or rent this movie!"
3,Good budget release of re-recorded hits,"This is a good budget collection if you want a sampling of Brenda Lee in certain genres. This series includes greatest Gospel, Rock and Country. But just be aware that these are the re-recordings of her hit songs she did back around 1996. She went back in the studio and recorded these with Owen Bradley so she could own some of her recordings. These recordings are very enjoyable but if you are looking for the original MCA/Decca recordings look elsewhere."
5,Nice towels,I really like these towels. I prefer them over dishcloths. They can be washed and used over and over again. I bought a box and am sharing with sisters. After reusing I still can give them to my husband to use in his garage work area. Very durable.
3,"must use premium butane, and even then..??..","I've had the windmill delta lighter for about a year and a half now, but probably used it less than a dozen weekends on outdoor excursions, usually in the alpine / snow. I have had to send it back for repair twice by now when the lighter stops expelling pressure. The ignitor clicks but no pressure can be heard coming out of the lighter as it should. After the first repair I filled it once with the standard Ronson butane again and it was working, but then I drained it and re-filled it with quad refined butane fluid hoping to avoid any future problems. Well the initial fill of low cost butane must have tainted it because it quit working again in short order. Sent it back for the 2nd time to be repaired, and have only used the quad refined fluid since. I hope that keeps it going, but time will tell. Needless to say, I dont have much confidence in this product."
4,works well,"This lighter is well made and is wind proof. I'm not sure about water proof but, is at least water resistant. I use it all the time on my canoe with wet hands w/o any problems. I have only had this lighter about 2 months and hope to have it for years to come."
3,Isn't windproof in winds over 20mph,When I got the lighter I filled it up and it seemed to work fine.Then I took it out sailing.It lights up the coil glows orange but it doesn't light anything. Turned it up to full and still nothing. Turned it down and then nothing.Went below and bang it worked and lights up - nice blue flame. Went on deck and nothing. Realized that in winds about 20mph the lighter lights but the flame blows out. Strange.
1,Windmill Delta Lighter,"Yesterday was the second time that I used the lighter. When the lighter is lit, it starts to sputter and the flames oges out. Your need to shut down and relight. At the price of this lighter, you would think that this should not be a problem. Very disappointing."
2,"Too much fuel, too little flame","This thing chugs fuel. I cannot understand why because it only generates the smallest of flames. It may not blow out and it may be rugged, but as a camper, I want a lighter that's going to carry a couple weeks of fuel and can help in wet light scenarios, not something that dies after a few uses and is difficult to use."
2,Dropped to 2 stars after 3 weeks.,"I read another review in which the smoker did not find it worked well lighting his cigars, it works just fine on my Arturo Fuentes's. I'd give it 5 stars if it held more fuel.UPDATE: I just updated my review and dropped it from 4 stars to 2. This thing is very hard to adjust to get a flame. Most of the time it doesn't have a flame at all, it just glows orange. I can hold my finger right over the glow and it barely gets warm.It seems that if it is at all cold outside this thing is useless. I was expecting much more quality for the price. Considering returning it before the 30 days expires. Or perhaps I'll just keep sending it to the manufacturer until I get one that works, maybe they'll get the message."
4,It works.,"Since I got it, I've never care the weather when I need to use it for smoking. Actually, I bought it for outdoor use but I have not got a chance yet. I'm lookin for it."
4,Feels like it will last,"Well made, and though all lighters like this are too pricey, this one is much less so.Also, kudos to Amazon's return policy - the 1st one came DOA, and return/replacement was impressively handled. Quick and hassle-free."
2,dosen't work,First it wouldn't fill up with butane.Then it wouldn't light.When I adjusted the flame and finally got it to light it wouldn't do so consistently.Then it wouldn't light when it was cold.As an emergency lighter to start a fire to save your life this is a failure.Buy wind proof matches.
2,Works great in high wind,Works great in high wind but flame width at such a high temp can be felt quickly on thumb while holding down fuel release.Uses up the onboard fuel quickly so if you plan on regular use during a weekend hike. You better bring refill.
3,Works well for less than 10 seconds at a time,I bought this lighter for emergency use starting fires (I do alot of climbing/backpacking). When I first got it I played with it adjusting the flame and whatnot and found that the metal button used to ignite it gets so hot after about 10 seconds its painful (even on a low setting!). I could also smell something like burning rubber/plastic coming from the inside so for kicks I used the medium setting with a glove for about 30 seconds and the parts around the button actually started melting!!! Luckily I got it at an REI store and they have the best return policy. For cigarettes this would work fine but for any use that requires continuous flame its just too powerful for its own construction!
3,Water Resistant,"I haven't had too much luck with water proof butane lighters. In fact, I have yet to find one that really works. This one lasted about six months. Got soaked a couple of times, dried out, started to function. Now the electronic spark doesn't work. It is water resistant, not water proof. It will work fine as long as you treat it under 'normal' operating conditions which doesn't work for me."
2,Buyer Beware,"Picture makes this thing look substantial. It is in fact quite small. It can be concealed in an average sized fist. In addition, the build quality is lacking. Its mostly plastic, the top hinge is also plastic and feels like it will be the first thing to break. Arrived unfilled - make sure to buy some butane at time of purchase. I think a regular old zippo would have been better for my kit."
4,light my lighter,"So far, have had lighter for 2 weeks and it has performed flawlessly. Wind has had zero effect on use."
3,Plastic Hinges Might Break,"This is a good lighter. And the rubberized exterior is nice. But the problem with these lighters is that the SMALL plastic hinge can easily break if you're not careful. I've been pretty ginger with mine, but it still wore over time. This item is a ""2 - 5 Year"" item, not a lifetime item.Just a word to the wise. Otherwise, I honestly think you're getting your money worth since the ""popular"" version is the same thing, and has the same problem ( small plastic hinge ). This is like 25% the cost."
4,Solid lighter,"The brand is no longer Windmill, its Ultimate Survival Technologies. This lighter is pretty solid, but I'm not sure about the reality of it withstanding 70-80 miles per hour wind. It is blown out pretty easily, but not as easily as a disposable Bic lighter. Will I take this lighter hiking with me? Yes."
2,Nice when new,"This product was fabulous for a year, but after 2 refills the valves were shot and it would not light. Not a particularly good value given that."
1,gas station lighter better. wouldn't buy,"this lighter is completely unqualified to be considered a survival lighter. a gas station lighter holds more fuel than this one and the flame is comparable to many of the torch lighters they sell for 2.99. out of curiosity i filled it completely full of fuel and lit it and ran out of fuel in 60 seconds! worthless! by the way, it only lights maybe 50 percent of the time on the first try."
1,I used this all the time and loved it for 3 months,"It is a torch, so it is windproof. This is a lighter I took great care of, showed off since it's pretty expensive for a lighter. I used only the best quintuple-refined fuel and NEVER had a problem with lighting or it going out pre-maturely. If I would have wrote this review a few weeks ago it would have been 5 stars (I loved it!)Now it doesn't light. Ever. I didn't even drop it and wasn't rough with it. (Although it's built to take a beating)"
3,CIGARETTE lighter!!,I don't smoke (for 20 years now). I did buy one of these a few years ago with the intentions of using it to burn ends of rope and starting camp fires and such. Well this lighter is job specific and that job is to light cigarettes... There is no real flame that shoots out of this lighter. It is more a cigarette sized hole in which you stick the end of the cigarette for lighting. About the only way to tell there is a flame is the wire inside the hole will be glowing red (in the dark a flame is visible). Great for lighting cigarettes in the wind but not much else.The lighter is made of plastic. It can brake.
2,"Works, yet....","The hinge is made of plastic,it breaks so easily.I can still keep it closed,with that metal hook thingy,hopefully it will stay shut and dry,when god decides to flood the Earth again."
5,Windmill lighter,"I purchased a similar lighter by Brunton from a different merchant. The Brunton unit was broken, right out of the box. The Windmill unit works and I've been using it for about a month now. No complaints."
1,really disappointed,"I bought one, used it for about 3 -months, and it stopped firing. I thought it was something I did so I bought (2) more(Not real smart!). Only one worked out of the package and the other one does not shut-off automatically. I got the other to work infrequently. I am part of a Search & Rescue group and had plans to make this part of our standard equipment. NOT!!!"
1,Don't Buy,"I have now recieved 2 of these lighers both failed within a day. I used the premium butane they recommeded, but the lighers only light a few times then failed to light. You would be better off with a disposable ligher."
1,Worked for 2 hours.....now nothing,"Bought this based the the reviews. Excited about getting it. Filled it up with suggested fuel. Great strong flame a first. Then after a few hours, nothing. I read on some of the other review sites of the same issues. Very disappointed"
1,"It's lowest quality there is, don't be fooled","I'm sure some of these do work and work well. Parts of the lighter are well built, but some critical parts aren't. Then again, that's the problem really, that only some of them may work well. Overall I rate this a one star because the product's features don't fit together well, nor do they match the claims. Parts of the lighter are well made and parts are the cheapest construction possible. Obsolesence is built into this product is my guess, and that causes premature failures.Anyway, I got one of the non-functioning units and took some time to discover just what the problem was. What I came across was low quality construction leading to multiple malfunctions (element and delivery mechanisms). It did work, but just a little. I used 5 times filtered butane (no cheap stuff). After a couple uses it just died a slow death.This lighter looks to be mostly a gimmic, not a daily-use or robustly useful tool."
2,Did Not Work When It Counted,"Bought this lighter new for backcountry backpacking emergencies. I tested it at lower altitudes before my backpacking trip and it worked fine. Last weekend far back in the mountains at 11,500' this new lighter did not work when I needed it -- the piezo element was either defective or broken. Fortunately, I had backup storm matches. Otherwise I would have been completely out of luck. This piece of kit will never find its way into my backpack again. It is unreliable, and expensive to boot. I would have been better off with a Zippo lighter."
5,NAFTA soul?,"I know bruce is canadian only because my best friend is in Penticton. I'm a musician myself and I spend a lot of time in Key West and listening to Bruces ""world music"" is nice. He's very global in the concepts that he plays in the form of ragas. Bruce is a nominee for my award of Favorite Canadian guitarist. There will always be Ian Tyson, Chris Rea, Sylvia Frica, Gordon and Joni Niel, but what differentiates Bruce from these peers is a literary resonance. I'm sure a lot of people would find him deeply hypnotic, and some would want him to foretell their future; he has that kind of cerebral knowledge of what you're hearing when you listen to him, like Yogi Berra said: ""Deva VU all over again..."". Bruce is a very serious guitarist whe hasn't been invited (that I know of) to record with Chet Atkins yet. But hey, Chet Atkins probably hasn't been invited to record with bruce either. This is a terrific product!"
5,Best Cockburn Release,"This is a live album and Bruce's very best. Nice sound and great quality. Poetic wonder, humble, inspiring, uplifting. A wonderful live album that one can listen to over and over again. Highlights - deer dancing round a broken mirror, all the diamonds, and well, every song on the album. MAD"
4,A satisfying finale.,"""A Time To Dance: Virginia's Civil War Diary, Book Three"" is the third and final installment in Mary Pope Osborne's trilogy. If you're look for fresh excitement and adventures, then you may be disappointed with this story. If you're looking for a continuation of Virginia and her family's life, then you may enjoy it. What kept my attention was Virginia's blossoming love for the theatre and writing - two of my passions. There is a lack of history in this final book. The story ends with the possibility of a fourth installment, since two new members will be joining the family. I recommend."
4,Wonderful resource for learning to pray the Scriptures!,"I really enjoyed this book. It isn't real long and it's not too heavy for the lay-person. Part I of the book consists of 10 chapters on such topics as Praying the Psalms, The Lord's Prayer, and Biblical Meditation. There is an excellent chapter on unanswered prayer, which is an important issue to address.The real goldmine in this book, however, is Part II, which consists of nine lists of specific scriptures to use in your prayers. There is a list of Psalms by mood, scripture passages on thanksgiving and praise, Bible promises, and also a Harmony of the Gospels type list that helps you meditate on the Gospels.This is an excellent resource on prayer for your personal library or your church library.Please check out my other reviews of Christian books and music."
3,Very Sweet,"This book is surface level at best, but it is very sweet for the new Believer in your life. Great Stocking stuffer, or gift for a friend. I found it a relaxing enjoyable book to read for one evening. Only 100 pages makes it a little short, but overall it's Decent!"
5,Excellent!,I paired these up with some good ceramic pads and my truck feels like new again. You can't beat the price either!
5,Nero's should have been,"I'll be brief: This is a fantastic album. I wish I could hear the lost Mercury recordings. This is one of my favorite albums EVER and that's saying a ton in my humble opinion. It is to this day in frequent rotation with U2, Zep, Hendrix, Police, etc. Damn shame industry politics kept this band from being realized."
2,does not work on computer with Flash Player 10,"I could not get the software to work on my computers since they all had Flash Player 10. I tried to install Flash Player 7 as the software suggested, but my computers would not allow this. You would have to have an older operating system (older than XP) for this to work, I believe."
5,THE AUTO ENTHUSIAST'S BIBLE,"This is THE reference for anyone who wants to visit the great auto museums of the world. Thousands have consulted this world wide list of auto museums and historic sites. Make your next trip both educational and fun. It's got everything you need: Names, addresses, telephone numbers and even descriptions of what you'll find. Couldn't be more useful to auto fans. The author is English, so don't be surprised by English spellings like colour for color. Still easily referenced by Americans."
3,ATV CABIN,Overall it is about six inches too tall. The cover is a bit too tight and straps on front and rear are not long enough to tie it down.
1,Prejudice dilutes a wonderful message,"Chapter ""Locking of Horns"", is quite unnecessary. I was put-off by the questioner's shallowness in posing a pedestrian question like ""..name the most remarkable man you have met"". This question gives UG (who is ever so ready!) a chance to cast his prejudiced views on JK."
3,It would have been better if Frank and Sammy had showed...,"This star studded compilation does pay a luke warm homage to Vegas. Mr. Las Vegas, Wayne Newton is featured in an early recording of ""Danka Schoen"". I bought this for Paul Anka's ""Times Of Your Life"" which has probably been played during every wedding in America for over 25 years. This was hard to find, especially if you don't want an entire Anka album. All the performers have one time or another left their mark in Vegas. Add a star when your in a nostalgic mood!"
4,Solid Representation of Good DJ's in the Past Two Decades,"Generally, I'm not a big fan of anything affiliated with MTV, but this disc is a promising sampler of a number of great djs from the past 15 years. The only disappointment is that Dj Shadow doesn't appear, but they got just about every other good dj on hear, so I can't complain. Best tracks: Showtime at the Dump by Peanut Butter Wolf, Cut Chemist Suite by Ozomatli, and the The Adventures of Grandmaster Flash On The Wheels Of Steel by Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five."
5,the Best C-D That I Own,"this c-d really got me into the dj scene. i picked it up expecting about 2 or 3 really good songs, but instead, the Whole c-d Was AWESOME. This c-d has to be one of my favorites of all time.you HAVE to get this c-d, i reccomend it for people who love to hear the dj's who scratch and make tight beats, some of the better songs are numbers, 2,3,7,8,9,10,12,&16.LOTS of really good songs"
4,Prayer Book,"This item is with me every time I pray, especially at church. It includes many common prayers and devotions. I have given them as gifts to family and friends. It is a great companion and a perfect size to carry in a shirt pocket."
2,"Cut him some slack,","Fresh from his breakup with Linda, RT seems to have staggered into the studio and cut loose on guitar. Band is pretty sharp too. If only he'd had some good songs written, this might not be his weakest solo album by far.Note: Some copies of this include the wonderful B-side ""Where the wind don't whine"", a much better song than anything else on this CD, and maybe worth the price by itself, at least if you already own all of his other solo disks."
5,Underrated Gem,"Coming from any other artist, this would certainly be rated 5 by most listeners. It's my favorite RT solo album. I think it's the closest to a live sound of any of his studio recordings. RT's humor slips through the gloomy facade that he cloaks himself in. At least give the songs a listen. You might like it too."
4,Good product - able to use my computer,"Works well, able to use it to recharge my computer and work on the charger. Remember to keep the car running otherwise drains the battery flat in about two hours.The additional 12v outlet is a boon and useful to connect other devices.The dealer took over three weeks to deliver it though they promised 5 day shipping and told us the item was in stock when ordered."
3,Unit had a metal rod as the FUSE,"I have had and used the Vector 150Watt inverter for several years now.This weekend hooked up a 59 watt seat heater to it for a trip. When turnedit on the unit ""hissed"", smoked, and started to go to flames in the car.Had to throw it out the window to stop it from burning in car. Luckily I wasin the driveway. When I examined it. The Fuse mount in the DC plug in had beenreplaced AT THE FACTORY with a metal rod to substitute for a fuse. What kind ofcrazyness is this? So be very careful and check your unit to be sure you havea real fuse in the DC connector neck.Dr. Ted J Cooper"
4,ogilvie home perm,Happy to be able to find product on line since can't find in stores. No complaints about product. Arrived in timely manner.
4,"Over, and over, and over, and over again","I had no idea what I was getting when I got this. I had just remembered seeing them on AMG as grunge, so I thought ""Hey, I better get this."" I was pleasently surprised. To me it sounds like a mix of the the Toadies and Cell maybe? I dunno. Kind of. Whatever they sound like, it is awesome. They definitely have a punky edge to them, but there is something more to them. I don't know what it is, but it makes them good. They are a little different than most of the other grunge bands out there. It could be that they are a little more melodic. I like how ""Boot Straps"" begins slow and then all of sudden becomes a punk song. The end of ""Liver vs. Heart"" is pretty cool. Even though ""Bag of Wood"" starts off like a ballad it is still quite a good song. Highlights include ""Wha'd I Mean To Think You Said,"" ""Feed Me,"" and ""Heinz Von Foerster."""
3,Doug sorely missed,"I must agree with the previous review: this definitely sounds like it was released by a Treepeople cover band. I normally wouldn't hold the absence of their most innovative songwriter, Doug Marsch, against the rest of the band, but isn't it delightfully ironic that the best song on this album, ""Too Long,"" was only included to make fun of Doug's songwriting style?"
2,Not a Useful Reference Tool,"This Thesaurus, although colorful and easy to read has far too few entries to be a useful reference tool for 3rd, 4th, 5th graders. Literally none of the words on my 4th grade daughter's spelling list (for which she needed to find synonyms) were in the book."
3,Not as many words as I thought there would be,"My daughter's teacher recommended me to get this book. But this thesaurus is very limited in words, or maybe my daughter's vocabulary is too advanced for this level."
2,Not worth it,"Had this for 5 yrs. works ok for deli meat, terrible with cheese. blade cuts uneven so meat ends up being cut on the diagonal. Lots of parts, all but one goes in the dishwasher nicely, still not enough to make me like it. plastic parts are not strong enough so that's part of the uneven problem. very slow too and messy."
1,Crap-ola,"What a waste of time and money. The 20% is purple and you can't see through it because it's foggy. I got the 5% for the rear windows. It's bad, too. the bubbles don't come out. I bought the self cling versions for practice, but I will still just save up and get it done professionally. It took about 1 hour to do 4 doors plus 2 quarter windows."
5,Great holiday read!,"You've got to love any book that starts with boys having a fist fight over whether or not there really is a Santa. At just over 50 pages, this is a quick, fun read. I liked that it wasn't centered around some horrible tragedy like so many holiday books. And it wasn't too sappy like a lot of Christmas books tend to be. Or too predictible, I was suprised a couple times. For a simple little book to cheer your holiday, this is a must read. I'm going to buy some for friends."
5,Excellent Customer Service,Got the chair in no time but the plastic housing that connects the back cracked. Contacted customer service they said no problem we will send you another one boom in 3 days it arrived and now I am loving my chair. Wooo HoooThank You so Much Jeff
2,flimsy and cheap,"The first three reviews on this chair looked great so I picked one up for my daughter. There is no padding in the seat, the chair is flimsy, and the material is scratchy to the skin. We are both quite disappointed."
1,No. Just no.,"As a fellow expatriate, I was ashamed to think that this is how people will see our world. Japan indeed is foreign, and I understand how the woman feels about being isolated. But the way to end the isolation where she is was to use the Internet time she had to look for information in her area. Getting out of her apartment, meeting people where she was and trying to understand the local customs goes a long way toward understanding and adjusting to a new place. Reaching out through email is great--I do it often--but a constant stream of whining does no one any good. This was a book that was a good idea spoiled.And if she thinks Japan is rough, heaven help her if she ended up in a real hardship post.This was a silly, slight book."
3,Disappointed,"I had this book in my TBR pile for quite some time, then was very disappointed. As someone who has traveled abroad quite a bit as well as lived abroad, I learned that the best way to endure is to make the best of every situation, and I do not feel the author did that. Through her eyes, all I learned was that she did not like it there. She needed to get out more. So what if her husband had to work. So what if she couldn't speak the language. How else will you learn? And with a military base nearby, as she mentioned near the end of the book, she surely could have found some people whom she could communicate with. Throughout the book she mentions writing this book and including pictures. Where were the pictures? Had she included some, maybe the reader could see things from her eyes. All this is, is a bound book of emails between two parties."
5,You've got to see this!!,"Natalie's albums are masterpieces. You can really get into her music by listening to them. BUT, to get the FULL experience, you MUST see her perform live!!I have seen her in concert a dozen or so times, and she has made me laugh, cry, and wisked me away to a place of pure peace and contentment with the beauty of her voice, and the emotion she conveys. When she sings live, her stage presence is POWERFUL. She mesmorizes me. This DVD is another opportunity to see the BEST----Mrs. Natalie Merchant. Don't miss it. You get to hear her tell the story behind each song. Her performance of ""Verdi Cries"" is particularly beautiful.No one can sing like her, and no one can move me the way she does."
5,Very thoughtful and entertaining,She gives a very nice story and background to each song and she doesn't ramble on more than needed. the songs were a great selection and also well played live. Highly recommend for her fans who somehow missed it. Even new listeners will like it. My 5 year old daughter really loves it too.
4,Sweet but Short,"I really like the performance, Natalie sounds great, the stories behind the songs are very nice, the band sounds great. Really, my only thing is that it is very short for a live DVD, only about 8.5 songs. I realize that is probably because it is from the Storytellers TV show rather than a ""regular"" concert. It would have been nice to have some extras, behind the scenes, commentary maybe. But anyway, the content that we do get is beautiful, it is what it is, and that is a good thing in this case."
4,Over all a very good concert,"Filmed in 1998 at the Manhattan Center in N.Y., this DVD has both a stereo and Dolby 5.1 soundtrack with very good sound quality.Natalie is dressed in a skirt and half-sleeve sweater for the performance, and the camera work is also very good quality.My only negative comment is that the concert starts with only the last minute and a half of ""These are Days."" The full-length version of this song is included on this extended cut, but the DVD goes back to the menu before the extended cuts can be played, even on the music only option."
3,CAUTION,This exam is not offered anymore (640-801). The new version of the exam is 640-863 DESGN so I would recommend purchasing the updated book for the 803 version as it would apply better tot he new exam.
1,How To Be A Carpet & Like It.,"I know I keep saying I like the older books better, but this one is an exception.Natalie Jones was a user, Josian Jones (not related) was a usey.Jo allowed herself to be used over and over again, even when she was hurt by some unknown force to her.She falls into what ever Natalie asks of her without thought. At one time she even questions her own easy to be used attitude.But when she agrees to go to an unknown place taking the golden gazelle, and Natalie's ring, pretending to be Natalie...I'd had enough, I put the book down at page 46.From the back of the book: 'Natalie Jones had got herself into a rather complicated and mysterious situation in Morocco-and somehow she persuaded her friend (she wasn't really Jo's friend, but a contemporary of Jo's sister Helen)Josian to take her place.This led Josian into a lot of adventures-with or without the disturbing Raymond Laurent!'"
3,An okay helmet bag. I'd rather get the usual kind,"This is a nice helmet bag that does what it is supposed to, but I like the one you get with your helmet better (the thin bag with a drawstring). This bag works well for keeping your helmet at home. It will keep scratches away from it (which the thinner bags wont). On the other hand, it is not good for taking it on the road with you. It is too bulky for that. Buy this depending on how you will use it."
4,Good bag,"This is a good, cheap bag.Holds both Simpson and Bell helmets with some room to spare.Soft, sheep skin won't scratch helmet or visor.Large zipper handle.Not a ton of padding, but enough as long as you are not extremely rough on it.Does NOT have room for HANS device along with the helmet."
5,great value,I saw the same product elsewhere for $10 more. The lining is nice and the zipper is sewn in a fashion that won't scratch the face shield of my helmet.
4,Nice bag for the money,Bag is big enough for hemet gloves and a sweater. Quality is appropriate for the price.
3,Lots of information but instructions not as clear as some other books,"I think ""New Complete Guide to Sewing (Readers Digest)"" and ""The Sewing Book: An Encyclopedic Resource of Step-by-Step Techniques"" are better books.They have much clearer pictures.This book is harder to follow. Some of the photos are not taken close up so you can't see what the author is talking about. The other books have much clearer step by step pictures and diagrams."
5,very handy,a very good reference book. detailed explanations to support memory lacks or skipped classes...!I love it and i feel confortable with it near to my table in all my new sewing adventures.you will not regret to have chosen it
3,ok,"the book did not have a lot of explanation for a sewing novice. if you need detailed explanation,then this is not the book for you. you'll need the sewing for dummies to break it down for you. this book is useful if you already have an idea of how to sew."
3,"Useful, but to a fault","Unless you're a skilled novice or intermediate sewer, this book isn't a useful resource for the very beginner. Take a class at your local community college or sewing store first, then check out this book... and buy it USED. But being a costume sewer, I've learned new and easier ways of doing basic applications, e.g. gathering, sewing collars and jacket linings, etc."
5,A wish come true for newbies!,"This book is so great! I just bought a nice sewing machine but have no idea how to use it. So I went to a bookstore and decided to buy this book for its colorful presentation. I learn how to use my sewing maching just by looking at the step-by-step pictures since they are all very helpful. The colors of the fabrics are presented in high contrast so that the difference is obvious. There are equipment section, pattern, basic technique and professional technique and some more. I recomend it!"
3,Goggles are good value,"As anyone who rides dirtbikes knows, the goggles go ""over"" the helmet. The little plastic tube that holds the strap to the goggles easily pops out of the strap, as soon as you stretch the strap. This was not a deal killer. I had my wife sew the strap to the goggles, instead of using the little plastic tube. Overall a good value. They're cheap enough that I wasn't put off by this little detail."
1,strap too small,"I never was able to use these goggles. The first time I tried to put them on over my helmet, the strap broke out of its hinge. The strap was wasy to small to fit over the helmet no matter how I adjusted it. I'll probably end up buying another strap as expensive as the goggles."
2,Misfiring and pretentious thriller,"The movie takes place on a single set, a floating lighhouse (the lightship of the title ) moored off the coast of Virginia .The vessel is captained by Klaus Maria Brandauer and he has a crew of four, plus his teenage son .All the above have their own deep ,dark secrets and grudges which are brought to the surface when the ship is taken over by a trio of escaping bank robbers ,comprising two lunkhead and disturbed brothers plus Robert Duvall as the monomaniacal gang leader .They become trapped on the ship as a storm rages rages outside isolating them still further from the outside world.This was done so much better in the 40's in Key Largo and the movie sufffers badly by comparison .Stiffly acted by normally capable performers ,this movie is ultimately scuppered by pretentious dialogue and a striving for ""significance "",.It should be tense ,claustrophobic and gripping but instead is slow ,limp and portentious .Avoid !"
3,No explanation,"I really like Violet Zaki, and enjoy her Self Firm Flat Abs DVD, but I am less impressed with this one. They jump right into the kickboxing moves without any explanation on how to do them, and run through them so quickly it's very hard to figure out how to do the move properly if you're new to kickboxing. About half of the workout is kickboxing, so if you're new to it or don't/can't do it, you're going to miss out."
4,Pretty good workout and really effective ;-),"This is a very good workout that I still do occasionally to this day. It will give you results if you do it often enough and it's fun to do so there's no problem.This uses three distinct exercise styles to give shape and burn fat off the three muscle groups within your tush. The cardio segment is also targeted to that area. The toning portion has classic lunges and squats with ballet-style pliés and relevés. This whole routine is geared to quickly burn fat and reshape your body. It's fun to do and motivating each and everytime you look at the stunning beach setting. That should get you thinking about swimsuit season. At the end of the dvd is a bonus ab workout that while small, will really help if you always tag it on to the end.This is really fun to do and enjoyable and before you know it, you've had a great workout that is bound to keep the fat off and tone up some of the major trouble spots we almost all have."
4,good video!,"Good workout for those over 40 like me. I am looking to tone these areas and none of the excercises are too diffucult. She does move very quickly from one move to the next and there is not a break for a drink of water, so keep the remote ready for pause...good for beginners looking to get back into a workout."
4,One of my favorites,"First of all I absolutely love this dvd. I work up a sweat every time (and am noticing improvement), and I enjoy the combinations and the fluidity of the routine. Violet Zaki is an excellent instructor and I intend to find another one by her, hopefully just as good. She works you with kickboxing, squats with optional weights (I tend to use 5lb weights), the dance for toning your hips and butt, and then finishes off with yoga. Personally, the yoga bores me, so I stop it there and go straight to the mini ab workout. As she says in the video, if you do the ab workout 2-3 times in a row, you'll get the most out of it. In a nutshell, I have a lot of fun waking up and working out to this DVD, especially because I think it's difficult to find any good ones. It's a great supplement to my bellydance workout DVDs =]"
5,"Barry Fergus Jones, CISM CISSP","This is the best single reference that I've seen on the subject. Kevin and Rebecca have assembled a guide that is eminently practical, superbly organized, and tremendously helpful. I reach for it every time I have a question on HIPPA. In fact, it's the only HIPPA reference I've used since I got it."
1,unenlightened,"I would have given this book a negative rating if it was available. Following up on the above critique. I agree that the above are nothing more than news articles (edititorials really), which were yellow journalism at the time and are very little more now. This book is of very little use to any serious student of Iroquois culture, as the author would mold our history and culture to fit contemporary political views and agendas. The term ""thnic Iroquois"" is especially ignorant considering the source, but I digress. The book provides an elementary understanding of true traditional culture and does not provide a compare/contrast of the handsome lake religion to the great law. I would recommend the book but I believe it would be a disservice to any serious student of Iroquios culture. Try Parkman, Morgan, John C. Mohawk, or even Fenton for a more balanced view!"
3,It was all good!,"I had to pick a book for an English project and so I checked this one out of the library. It was an ok book- but don't buy it first, check one out of the librrary or ask a friend to borrow their copy!"
4,Great Reference Tool,"We had to choose only one bible commentry to take with us when we moved overseas and this was the one we chose! It is a wonderful resource that adds something to our understanding of the scriptures whether for personal study or preparing messages. The background information it provides on each book are excellent and MacDonald gives the views of various scholars,not just one doctrinal bias. The only criticism that we do have is that the old testament is covered rather lightly."
4,Enlightening,"Very detailed commentary from a slightly conservative standpoint. If you read the Bible from a very literal standpoint, this book is for you."
3,Believer's Bible Commentary,"It is what it is, It an ok bible commentary.I am waiting for Parry Stone to finish his new bible commentary. That will be a great Bible Commentary!"
5,I love it,A fantastic way to study Scriptures. Clear understanding of difficult areasTrue to the BibleI recommend this to anyone wanting a better understanding of Scriptures in laymans terms
5,Clear and Concise,"Believer's Bible Commentary by William MacDonald is a very easy but concise maxim for the diligent student of the scriptures. It serves as a wonderful compliment to the Bible by turning complex study into functional and constructive comprehension. Its precepts are practical & down-to-earth expressions of general biblical truths and fundamental principles. By reading the Believer's Bible Commentary, one can understand the scriptures within his or her own experience. Some say that this commentary is too empty but I beg to differ. Careful analysis of this marvelous literary work will give the reader a transparent look into the Holy Scriptures, which will put his or her mind at ease. This is possible because MacDonald does a superb job keeping the interpretation simple and straightforward. I highly recommend this book to all students who enjoy the study of God's Word. Kudos!!"
4,Good Reference for the Bible Teacher and Student,"A good resource for the Bible teacher and student, MacDonald's insights are easily understood and applicable to everday living.The commentary has a helpful summary for each book of the Bible (introduction, authorship, date, background/theme, and outline) that helps the reader better understand the Bible. Also helpful are the maps, harmony of the gospels, messianic prophecies, descriptions of people and places of the Bible.If you are looking for a basic one-volume commentary of the Bible, I highly recommend it! However, if you are looking for more technical and comprehensive information, I recommend the Expositor's Bible Commentary, Barnes' Notes, among other sets - just depends on what you are looking for!A good supplement for the person who wishes to know more about the Bible and particular Bible verses."
3,"Stars for Kindle maneuverability, not content","The Believer's Bible Commentary is a wonderful Bible study assistant. I have no quibbles with the content; others have covered it more ably than I. My issue is with the Kindle edition. Be aware (as of early January) that the maneuverability of the Kindle edition is tremendously clunky. There is a navigable table of contents, but if you go anywhere else in the book from there, it's nearly impossible to return. It also doesn't seem to have been indexed yet, so searching for a Bible book doesn't seem to be available. And scrolling through 66 books is a pain! So ... content-wise, have at it. But beware the Kindle edition in its current form. I have submitted a tech-support form for this and asked for my money back if there is no way around the maneuverability issues."
5,Best commentary I have used.,"I have used this commentary for many years. And when I used to work in a Christian book store I asked people to compare this commentary with any other, side by side. They always purchased the Believer's Bible Commentary. I now purchase them to give to friends that need good Bible instruction and encourage them to get into a Bible study."
5,Believer's Bible Commentary,This commentary is extremely helpful. It gives clear understanding of the scriptures in simple English language. It compares the noted scripture with other related scriptures in some texts.Nice size print easy to read......I truly enjoy using this commentary. It has truly been a blessing to me for my everyday studying of the Bible!!!!
4,Good but needs to be supplemented,"This is a good one-volume commentary. It has some good insights in the Word and some helpful illustrations. However, it needs to be supplemented with other commentaries. It is dated and lacks some precision (e.g. in Psalm 23 he sees the cup, etc. as for the sheep rather than the imagery changing to a host which almost every scholar agrees with). Use some newer technical and expositional commentaries for the book you're studying/preaching through and this will be helpful."
2,Mixed bag.,"This commentary reads well, but it is shallow. Granted, in a one volume commentary you can't expect much depth. However, it is achievable by the likes of Wiersbe, Wycliffe Bible Commentary and others. I would rate this one as somewhat devotional, NOT scholarly or exegetical in nature. The writer comes from a dispensational, Plymouth Brethern background, so buyer beware."
1,Believer's Bible Commentary,I FIND THIS IS BOOK IS NOT WANT I THOUGHT IT WAS. IT DOES NOT HAVE THE SAME COMMENTARY AS THE HARDBACK I HAVE. IT IS A BAD BUY ON MY PART. TOM PORCHO
4,Good beat,Love their down to earth grasp of humanity in their songs. Would love to see them in concert. They keep rocking out more tunes.
4,INTO THIN AIR - DRAMA DVD,"""Into Thin Air"" is an excellent drama (based on a true story) of an Ontario, Canada mother and familily's wearing struggle to find thier son, gone missing enroute to a summer college classin Denver, U.S.A.Frought with difficulties in even getting police to list the boy on missing persons police computers and left to their own drive and devices. Following scant disconnected and confusing partial paper trails of cashed money orders that lead only to more confused mystery, the family finally hires a private dectective who makes the story of their sons disappearance and fate unfolds.Not a fast-paced nerve ride like most movies today, but a worthy view as the movie's pace while being viewed sets the same frustrating, trudging trying emotions they family goes through in their journey, but not boring. Just don't look for adrenalin here. Look for the realistic emotions, frustration, trying times and exasperation battled through by love-driven drive to find the boy."
4,Movie,"I love Ellen Burstyn and had heard it was a good movie. I wish the ending would have been diffenent. On a 1-10 scale, I give it a 8."
3,1/2 the meat 2x the money,"I also bought the Superlift 1105 Steering Pitman Arm, and it is way more beef, for almost half the price!"
1,What A Nothing,"Some interesting sites, but the script/dialogue is terrible. The mafia ""doll"" that's along for the ride is distracting to the whole idea of the tour. What innane comments! I would have dumped her in the Jersey Meadows within five minutes."
3,We Love Goomahs!!,"Don't raise your expectations too high for this poorly-made, B-acted documentary. But those details are exactly what makes it enjoyable to watch. Some of the behind-the-scenes details are memorable, especially the Satriales Pork Store facade and the pizza shop montage. John Fiore hams it up throughout, and goofs on himself in the process, but doesn't take himself too seriously and ruin the mood. Overall, good stuff for the diehard Sopranos fan, but don't expect Jimmy Gandolfini or Edie Falco memorable moments to show up much on this production."
2,"Okay, But Not Outstanding.....","As a Sopranos avid fan, I was very excited to recieve this DVD as a gift. From the moment I pressed play and John Fiore's ""comare"" Marie emerged from the limo, I wanted to throw my remote at the TV...ANYTHING to make her STOP TALKING! The reason I gave any stars at all was because they did cover basically all the sets from The Sopranos and gave some backround information. They also had some interviews from cast and crew members. If it wasn't for that, I would have turned it off, because Marie's overacting of an Italian girlfriend and her horrible nasally voice and excessive whining made me want to go ""whack"" someone!"
5,Very useful for option novices,"Just got the book a few days ago and finished reading it. It explains in detail how to go about selling covered calls - where to research information, how to identify suitable stocks/options. You can tell that the author had in mind to have the reader follow through and succeed in selling calls.I also appreciate the Excel templates on the floppy disk that comes with the book."
1,"Too much words, lack of structure, information and risk-awareness","One star down for the print quality - but you are warned, it is a plastic comb, quite overpriced then, though.Second star down for what has been mentioned by previous writer - emphasis on potential profit, too little focus on risk - I disagree that the major risk is lost profit opportunity if stock shoots up, this is misguiding and will cost you money.Third star down for amount of information contained - too many words and assumptions used, lack of evidence and unique information/ideas.Fourth star down for a style - it is written as a novel with one couple and their advisor - Max, The Guru... This makes it also quite unstructured.Summary: Dry as a novel and poor source of trading information. There are better novels as well as better trading books."
1,Disapointing!,If you know a little bit about options and covered calls then this book is a waste of money. Better tittles can be found.
3,Not worth the money,"I generally will not trash a book that is targeted at the novice but this will be an exception. First, I am a novice at options investing so should have been right in the middle of the target market for this book. Fact is, I learned more just searching the Internet while I was waiting for the book to arrive than I learned from the book. It is just too simplistic. All the knowledge contained in this book could have been conveyed in a 20 page pamphlet rather than this 300+ page puff piece with its wide margins and large fonts. A true disappointment."
4,Self righteous pablum,"This book, based on the reviews here, is self-righteous pablum with little factual substance. A better, book, one that I've actually read, is Chris Edwards - Downsizing the Federal Government (Cato)."
4,Explanation for What is Wrong in Washington,"Dr. Tom Coburn is a true hero for our Republic. With a Washington that is completely out of control, Coburn explains what is wrong. The bottomline is that people get elected to Congress and soon fall into line with the paradigm that its all about being reelected. They leave behind their principles and what is right and pursue what will benefit them politically.Coburn is a conservative Republican but he is also an independent. In this book, he details his experience with the Republican revolution of 1994 and how it went wrong. Basically, it went wrong because the Republicans decided it was more important to keep power than to do what was right. This is an important book and I recommend it for those interested in the inside scoop of how Washington works, especially spending and budgeting. However, if you're not a political junkie, this is not the right book for you."
4,breach of trust,"This is an excellent book. If you want an inside look at Congress and the workings of Washington, if you want to be mad or madder than you should be now,,,,,,,,, read this book. Caution Amazon is extremely slow in shipping products.......... most of the books I buy on line are shipped within a day or so. not so with Amazon.. Most books that I buy online I recieve within 5 days or so........ not so with Amazon.. so look for alternative suppliers"
5,This Book Changed My Whole Perspective!,"As a Christian Conservative, it was eye opening to learn what really happened after the election of 1994. This is truly an insider's view on the whole situation. What I found especially appalling was how the Republicans made sure that no single version of Term Limits could pass. Yet Tom Coburn kept his pledge of serving only 3 terms in the House.Ever wonder why Coburn, a Republican, keeps getting reelected in a heavily Democrat region? And he got elected to the Senate in 2004 in an election where most Republicans were getting booted out - He won 53% to 41% - a landslide."
5,Great Treat,"For dogs allergic to chicken, beef, venison, bison etc, these are a great product and my dog loves them and begs for more!"
2,Far better books available,"Rottweilers by Anna Katherine Nicholas (ISBN 0-87666-747-7) is an uneven book, not really suitable as an introduction into owning Rottweilers. Considerable space of the 125 page book is spent on breeding, genetics, and the care of the whelping female. I would think this of zero interest to a beginning Rottweiler owner. On the other hand, there is little attention spend on training.Far better is Urs Ochsenbein's book ""Rottweilers"". It's about the same physical size, although longer at around 150 pages. Ochsenbein details everything from puppy selection and health care to training. He gives enough information that can start an owner on a dog training path so that one might not need the services of a professional dog trainer, for basic obedience, at least."
4,ANOTHER POINT FOR THE BRITS!!,"This CD has not been out of my car since I bought it!! ""Testify"" is a soulful song thats the perfect first track. So many of the songs on the CD are perfect for us ""House Heads"" out there."
1,They can't be serious... I WANT A REFUND!,"I'm not sure why Hollywood thinks so little of children, that they would stoop to such a level. The computer-animation is amateur and aggravating to watch, the songs made my dog howl at the moon... my child and I could not make it through the entire movie. I would suggest staying away from this... looks cute on the outside, but the content proves to be a major disappointment"
1,Disappointing... Don't waste your time! Poor animation.,"If it were visually pleasing I could have at least put the T.V. on mute during the awful songs... unfortunately, the amateur animation which even my youngest pointed out is not worth watching. The video (which is only about an hour) should be avoided. B movies are fine for adults looking for cheesy action movies, but let's not subject our children to low-rent cost-cutting."
1,RIP-OFF! Cheap animation. Off-key singing. STAY AWAY!,"This poor excuse for a movie appears to have been made on some type of home computer! The animation was irritating, and I guess they didn't feel they needed singers to do the singing. Save your money. The book was O.K., but my child found the type difficult to read. Don't know what Michael York was thinking! RIP OFF!"
5,On-Pack Book Helps Reading Skills,"There's a top-quality, hard-cover storybook provided free with each video of this cute animated film which my son has read everyday for two weeks! The color illustrations in the book and the large print type make it easy for him to follow the film, and to figure out the words by himself. It's been a great tool for his reading skills, because he's excited to watch the video and follow along with the book. Although the animation of this video is not quite to Disney standards, my son and his friends don't seem to care and he has placed PUSS IN BOOTS at the top of his video stack."
5,Greatest DVD ever made,"I bought this DVD as soon as it came out, and have been introducing Dr. Steve to people ever since. A few episodes is usually enough to get anyone to really like this show (besides my mom lol), anyone who finds alternative humor funny should definitely buy this. 6/5 stars for John C. Riley at his best."
1,This is an abomination,"This show was an abomination upon the world, like someone had spread crap on a fresh, tasty virgin bagel, and had thrown it in the face of a 7 year old girl, and then after that, burning a Christmas tree with a menorah and then topping off the fire with Quanza decorations, then after that person dies, his grandson, Little Hittler, takes everything bad in the world, from running out of toilet paper, to shooting a pack of kittens in the face while they are napping with puppies, and puts it on a television show with a once funny actor. Seriously, if John C. Reilly is this desperate for air time, then he should just give up his career as an actor. What happened to adult swim, it's like they're letting anybody on their network nowadays. And John, Stick to real comedies, not something a 2 year old wrote."
5,I give this 5 wet kisses!,"Don't be a hunk, just by the dang BCB already ya Dangus! Loads of deleted scenes and extended scenes makes this worth every prenny you spend. This show will make you laugh so hard you'll empty your Spaghetti House all over the floor. You need to definitely CHECK IT OUT!"
5,It's just a bunch of hunks anyway.,"knock knock.who's there?your friend.but i don't have any friends.that's a joke from dringus and drungle comedy team.just buy it already, ya dingus!"
5,Worth all that paper money,If you can't find this tape in a drumster and have to pay paper money for it you should you dingus.
2,Heep does Aerosmith!,"This is Uriah Heep trying to keep up with the times. The music sounds like a dead ringer for Aerosmith's ""Love in the Elevator"" period. The problem here is, Heep was and is basically a 70's band. Wasting their talent on this sort of early 90's hair metal was not a good move. Heep was at their best when they did what they did best - 70's hard rock, heavy on the organ and bass, with mystical themes in the lyrics. The music here is not bad, for the genre - it's just not what we have come to expect from Uriah Heep over the years. You'll like this one only if you think Aerosmith (and Poison, and Warrant, et al) are the pinnacle of rock."
2,First track that's all,"When I came into a store last week, the song playin was just great so I asked ""who's that?"".The answer was Uriah heep, the song Blood on stone.I was very surprised cause I'm a Heep fan up till High and Mighty (plus conquest and Abominog).I was so glad to hear such a great song from a newer heep, i bought the cd.Well that's about it...one real good track and 11 or 12 fillers.Not bad, I mean those guys know how to make music but really uninspired.The one good thing I discovered was the singer's voice...that guy sounds good, I might try some new Live stuff."
2,Heep's weakest?,"I hate to criticise Uriah Heep. For one thing, they're always being piled on; for another thing, they're one of my Top 10 favorite bands. But after just listening to ""Different World"" for the umpteenth time in a vain effort to find whatever great it was that I'd missed, what can any objective reviewer say? This is a weak album. There are some decently written songs sprinkled throughout the disc, and some typically strong musical performances as well. But the production, the mix, and the general style are not suitable for Heep. I wouldn't have guessed this was a Uriah Heep record if I didn't already know it. It's not a terrible record, but it's not very good, and certainly the weakest release of Uriah Heep's long and satisfying career. Whatever you do, buy this disc last."
3,Wyrldmaker: Truesure or a Curse,"Kemen starts out across the worlds, the Wyrldmaker at his side. He does what no man has done, he lives through his suicide and faces worlds and universes that no other has seen.This takes place across worlds no other could imagine, with towers built from floating trees, and ships that sail on giant wheels across a desert plain.I thought the world building was outrageouse, and rather complex, which made it interesting, but the plot had a little to be desired. The chars were even more interesting. I would recomend reading it then setting it free from bookcrossings.com"
5,Perfect! Will not find a better price!,"I shopped around for an entire afternoon looking for a fuel pump for a dead 2001 GMC Yukon. The AFTERMARKET pumps were in the $250+ range and this same pump was almost $300 at O'Reilly's.You won't find a better deal, and its the OEM pump! Next cheapest were Rockauto and Partsgeek.com."
3,Description,This item said it would work on the FLEX Fuel model but it did not. Just an FYI when ordering.
3,it works!,"I have a super sensitive skin and I break out quickly! So far no break out, but it really dries my skin. I only use it 1-2x per week to see if it helps the dryness! Quick shipping is great!"
2,Nothing special,"I bought this after reading good reviews for occasional adult acne and specially to control the production of oil. I also expected help with first sings of aging (I am in my late 20's). I've been using it daily for a month and a half and I do not notice any difference in my skin, I have not gotten acne but my face is as oily as before and new whiteheads have appeared. The fine lines look the same. The concentration of Glycolic acid seems to small to actually make a difference. I would not recommend this, and definitely too expensive for a tonic that does not seem to be much different from a drugstore $8 one."
3,Movie Synopsis:,"An obvious spoof of the popular game show, Who Wants To Be A Millionaire, this take features a slew of sexy female contestants answering their questions in order to win not only a billion dollars, but also lots of erotic fun with sexy host Remis Phildin and co-hostess Bambi."
2,Did you like Eraserhead?,This movie is dark and bizarre. The plot is flat and predictable. The effects are laughable. It is a cross between Eraserhead and Attack of the Killer Tomatoes. It seems more like a high school film project.I recommend seeing it just for laughs.
4,I'm the music composer,"The release of ""That Little Monster"" and ""The Visitant"" on DVD is memorable. The marriage of film to sound creates an invitingenvironment that stirs the imagination, and leaves one wanting more."
1,Lynch-ian? Hardly.,"This wreaks of ""student film"". It tries too hard to be cute and quirky. Other reviewers compared it to ""Eraserhead"" and I have NO idea why. Eraserhead certainly didn't try to be cute. This film is also compared to ""The Twilight Zone"" series. Again, a body of work that one would hardly be described as being cute.Everything in this film screams - AMATEUR - and it makes me wonder if the other reviewers aren't somehow connected to this project. The acting is horrible. There are way too many shots done at weird angles, as if trying to be SO avant garde. Not. This is a joke, and a poor one at that. Avoid it. Especially if you are a fan of David Lynch."
2,SHEER TORTURE,"RT has more chops than the Omaha Steaks web site as is clearly evident on this release. Still, I cannot overlook the coughing, wheezing and sour vocal notes that permeate this album. This is a very poor performance that should have never seen the light of day. I think he ought to join the Bee Gees and take poor old Maurice's place in the band. He wouldn't have to sing that much and besides they even look a good bit alike. Maybe no one would know the difference.Small Town Romance should be re-relased under the title I've Suffered For My Art, Now It's Your Turn."
3,Fun and a little folksy,"OK, so I only paid [item price] at the used bin at my local store, but it was well worth it. This is a fun CD that I find myself inflicting on friends who don't find it as funny as I do. Mojo Nixon's introduces ""Levee"" with ""Ahhhhh! Robert Plant's a ...!!!!"" ""The Wanton Song"" sounds like good 70's porn music. Several tracks are taken seriously with some sweet results. ""Tangerine"" is even sadder than the original and ""Out on the Tiles"" will pull your face into a grin for three minutes. I pull this one out maybe 3 times a year for a week or so."
2,Busted,"An L.A. cop and a murder victim's father struggle with their realization that all women are prostitutes in this washed-out DVD of a middling 70s thriller. Burt's amusing flippancy in most scenes undercuts what elsewhere tries to be a morally murky drama, and long romantic scenes dull the thriller pace. The picture's blatant misogyny doesn't help matters.Most of the scenes are set bound so except for Burt's sweet ride we don't get much period flavor. The whole thing plays like a very foul-mouthed T.V. episode and the vulgarities are so plentiful and tin-eared that even by today's standards they may shock.Amid some rank overacting, Eddie Albert as the affable but venal villain clearly steals the picture."
2,"Good Message, Poor Movie","I like these types of movies, and saw the DVD on sale for $9, so I gave it a look. With Burt Reynolds and Catherine Deneuve being movie legends I figured what did I have to lose. Unfortunately, the movie really misses the mark and is not very good, except for the message. Slow and predictable, it reminds me of a bad Frank Sinatra's movie.Robert Aldrich, who did a masterful job on ""The Longest Yard - 1974"" was the director, and he and Burt were the film's producer. The film really needed a good producer and it might have been better. However, it was great to see Deneuve in a U.S. film and the DVD quality is very good."
2,Watching this movie reminds one of how bad an actor Burt really is/was,"Would you believe there was time I thought Burt Reynolds was a good actor (Sharkey's Machine)? But even in ""Deliverance"" I didn't think he was that great. I just keep seeing him as ""The Bandit"" driving around, making an a** of himself, while being chased by Buford T. Justice (Jackie Gleason). I also realize how bad an actress Catherine Deneuve was when I watched this flick. Beautiful and gorgeous, but terrible acting.Burt kinda' plays his old Dan August part in this movie. The interaction between Reynolds and Deneuve borders on hilarious; when they're trying to be serious. Seriously.It must have been that period of time when acting was different. Even Paul Winfield comes across like he's doing a reading at an audition. His scene with ""The Albino"" is terrible (i.e. stereotypically laughable).Ben Johnson and Eileen Brennan contribute to this slow, laborious undertaking in establishing the plot. Ugh!"
2,A real con job,"Slow, murky and joyless, Hustle has little to recommend it.Burt Reynolds and Paul Winfield are dull as dishwater (dirty dishwater just about sums this movie up) and the plot - about a dead stripper and her war Veteran father - is about as exciting as watching paint dry. The whole thing could have been wrapped up in a (very) average episode of CSI.Catherine Deneuve is cute as Reynolds' hooker girlfriend, and I had fun pretending to myself that Ernest Borgnine's police chief was the same character as the one he played in The Poseidon Adventure. Yes, Hustle was that boring: I had to make stuff up for myself.There's lots of gratuitous female nudity too, so add sleazy to the film's credentials. But most of all, it's just a bore."
3,What might have been...or not.,"Those born in the Reagan years may not realize that for a brief shining moment in the late 1970s, Burt Reynolds was the most popular movie star on the planet. Just prior to that, in 1975, he made this movie, and gives a creditable, serious and even moving performance.If he had not grown the mustache and played up the good old boy shtick and annoying high pitched laugh, he may not have been Numero Uno for those couple of years, but he might have been taken more seriously and made better movies.Perhaps not. This is the man who was first choice to play the Jack Nicholson part in TERMS OF ENDEARMENT and opted to do STROKER ACE instead.In any event, this is a good example of gritty, bleak 1970s movie making, when mainstream Hollywood flicks could be dark and even have an unhappy ending. In 1976 ROCKY came along and changed all that.A little dated, and a less than crisp DVD transfer, but worth checking out."
3,The acting was great,"The performances in the movie were amazing, especially Govinda's and Tabu's.It's not often you get to see Govinda in a negative role, and that is why his performance was so awesome. Who would have ever imagined Govinda as a psychopath.And Tabu was great as usual, although she could have used more screen time."
2,Trailer was better than the entire movie,"After watching the trailor, I was expecting a great mystery, but was very disappointed.In fact I nodded out a couple of times"
3,Not as good as I expected,"When I bought this book, I was looking forward to reading stradagies on how to make my sparring better. I am currently a 1st degree black belt. I like to watch Sparring competition, and I also like to compete. But I wanted to make it better. When I saw this book, I thought that it would give you some good tips. As I went through it, I only found out that it did have some things to help you. But the things were for beginners. All of the advice they gave you was just common sense. This book did not in any way help me in my Sparring training. But, I do reccomend this book for those who have just began Sparring. The book does have good pictures. And gives you a workout plan that you could use."
5,WOW...Awesome!!,"I own this television and its great! Great picture, great brightness and was one of the most affordable plasma TV's in the market. Its been about 5 months since I've owned this and I've very happy. Highly recommend it."
1,Lackluster DVD,"This dvd in my opinion is not very good. The scenes are totally pointless. You would only like this dvd if you had no idea of what gos on in the streets.. This would be like taking your camera with you while you go chill and not doing anything special. The concert footage is terrible and there aren't any videos. The bonus cd is ok I guess, but not worth it all."
4,For the fans,"This DVD is a great DVD for the fans of Kurupt (and the DPG*), it shows them (The DPG) backstage at conserts on the Puff Puff Pass Tour, it has some consert fotage, but DO NOT BY THIS DVD LOOKING FOR CONSERT FOTAGE if you do you will be disapointed. If you want consert fotage I recomend The Up In Smoke Tour DVD (it dosn't contan mutch, if any Kurupt).This DVD has great music and fun scenes.The Bonus disc (whitch acording to Fortress DVD**) is limited is worth the prise buy it self sence it contains unreleased Kurupt tracks.* DPG is the ""Gang"" of musicians (including Daz, Snoop, Tray Deee and more) witch Kurupt belongs to.**Fortress DVD is the company that released this DVD"
4,This is the right size,"We purchased several mint molds when we purchased this, many of them only made 4 or 6 mints at a time. But this one makes a stack of them."
4,Kitchen for kids,"This is a nice cookbook for kids with plenty of recipes for desserts and a few main meal recipes too. Photos are included with every recipe which is nice to see since so many kids books typically use illustrations or nothing at all. It would have been nice to see more savory dishes instead of so many sweet recipes.I purchased this for my 13 year old, wanna be chef. She enjoyed the book & it was easy for her to tackle recipes on her own."
3,Too many desserts,"This was a nice cookbook, but it has too much of a focus on desserts and not enough focus on cooking healthy foods a child will enjoy."
2,TOOOO Sweet,"Very disappointing... 3/4 of the recipies were for sweets. I was hoping for real meals that were easy and healthy, as well as tasty. I would not recommend the book."
1,Yoga After 55,"This was a complete waste of money. It was made for people 85 and older sitting in their wheelchairs in a nursing home rolling their shoulders and wiggling their fingers for exercise. It had very little, if anything, to do with yoga. It also was not 60 min long, as advertised. I am very, very unhappy with it.I only gave it one star because the field had to be filled with something."
2,This is an exciting cd that you will want to own,"This cd is one that I stumbled onto at the record store. I had never heard of Chris Peacock before. I am sure the people who live in Washington State know his name very well, for this is where he performs his magic.To talk a little bit about this cd, I would like to begin by saying Chris sure is a master of the piano. He plays in a very natural style with great command of his songs. He does not try to show off, but delivers a grand perfomance.The only dark spot I can bring to your attention, about this cd, is the song selection. I thought it could have been better. Chris plays a mixture of classical and popular songs. I feel like this was probably a mistake to mix the two venues.I will plan to buy more of Chris' cds in the near future."
2,the Strategy Guide is a VERY big disappointment,"I was very disgusted with the prima Strategy Guide for silent hill. The book lacked the complete list of the games weapons, it did not explain what some items do, also the maps did not tell you where all the items were. Prima also did not tell you how to get the katanna or the hyper blaster and did not even mention how to get a hidden ending. So for any one that wants a silent hill strategy guide don't get this one."
1,No secrets?,"Hey where are the secrets in this book? How to see the UFO, the hyper blaster and the sword. This book dosen't even list them."
3,"Not a bad basic book, but not detailed enough.","This book is not bad until you get to the puzzels. It cannot solve puzzels for anything. If you just wanna get through the game, its OK. But if you wanna get complicated, save your money."
1,FOR CRYING OUT LOUD I DONT EVEN HAVE THE BOOK!,HOW IN THE WORLD DO YOU GET THIS BOOK!? I HAVE BEEN SITTING HERE ON MY COMPUTER TRYING TO FIND OUT WHERE TO GO!
4,Great Sytsem,"I've been using this system since 2005 and really like it. Though I've learned some things the hard way, like not mounting the wireless sensor directly to a metal surface, I really like the system. It has already saved my house/possessions once. I like it enough to be looking for another two wireless remotes. If anyone has one or more, please email me at jlauren@myadvantageplus.com. Also if anyone else is still using the system and needs some remote sensors, email me. I have a few extra. DIY Jerry"
3,socialism,"Mr. Stuart Chase as always presents a well written case for his root position of Government control of the nation's economy, without using the ""S"" word. Some of his earlier work ""new deal"" used by FDR as a basis his socialist economic policies on. A good study of the mentality behind socialism. I would also recommend ""The Road Ahead"" by John t. Flynn 1949 with additional insight on Mr. Stuart Chase"
3,Pasa,"Este diccionario pasa. Sinceramente me gusta mas la tercera edición (The Collins Spanish Dictionary Third Edition). El Collins Spanish Unabridged Dictionary, 8th Edition es muy bromoso y no tiene muchos términos tal como la palabra ""bromoso"". No lo recomiendo para el uso de traducciones amplias."
1,Not worth 1 $,"this is a big hardcover book but will not rest open while reading. Although this is common nowadays (due to a cheap binding methods and cheap paper) it's a big inconvience if when looking up a word in another spanish book for obvious reasons.Also if you're American like I am good luck looking up english expressions, ALL the english here is British. On the Spanish side there are some noted regionalisms, but i think for the learner its best to learn the stanard Spanish usages only (believe me you wont have any trouble understanding Spanish in other regions of Spain or the Americas.) I think this shows a racist mentality on the anglo-saxon publishers part: devide el mundo castellanohablnte while uniting the english world."
5,Better than store bought,"Compared to permanents given in shops today, Oglivie is by far the better permanent. The before and after perm treatments helped make my gray hair curly and shiney and not dried out. Amazon has quick and reliable delivery."
4,Good start.. Now let's hear more.,"This debut effort from Martin, Bhatt, and Schrader is inconsistant and messy but shows a lot of promise. I actually remember hearing Bhatt and Schrader doing some work about 5 years ago and you can here their style even if the genre has gone from rock to industrial and dance. I'm curious how much Martin actually contributed to this CD since the guitar work is spread pretty thin.Not a bad first CD, but I'd like to hear what these guys will do next. More dance? More rock? Something else entirely? Bring it on!"
2,Skip this one.,"Madeline, Madeline's Rescue, and Madeline and the Gypsies are all fine books, but Madeline's Christmas is a dud. It doesn't have the same cadence as the others, and the plot is not as appealing."
2,MADELINE'S CHRISTMAS DOESN'T LIVE UP TO BEMELMAN'S OTHERS,Madeline's Christmas was a disappointment. Stick to the other Madeline tales!!
3,MADELINE'S CHRISTMAS,"The book with printed story and pictures is excellent, deserving a 5-star rating. The CD, however, seems totally inappropriate for an audience of 3- to 6-year-olds. The combination of English, French, and French accented English is more confusing than enlightening. The CD content goes far beyond the content of the printed pages, adding to the confusion potential. The print-audio combination might work for some older children, but the story is most likely to interest younger ages."
5,Neat!,The story is great! The book comes in a plastic case with a CD and it is all really nicely done. Perfect for a gift.
5,Great book,"A Christmas gift for my 4 y/o granddaughter who not only loves her Madeline doll, she loves the story that goes along with her. Long after Christmas, she still likes the book read."
5,Arsonists Get All The Girls,"excellent band with a swell name. i don't see how the previous reviewer could call this cd boring, even if you don't like it. the sound is completly progressive and it flows. a lot of the time when a band tries to get crazy it's not fluent. it's butter. this is the best hardcore band out right now, as well as the best cd of it's genre."
2,medio-CORE,"I first heard this band a few months ago through my cousin. While visiting my local FYE store, I decided to give it a go seeing as how there was nothing else appealing to me.I can best describe their sound as See You Next Tuesday and The Number 12 Looks Like You mixed with The Locust. I like SYNT, but despise The Locust and #12 Looks Like You.This cd is borderline boring. I can't say I'm a huge fan of the vocals, or the electro-grind parts. The sticker on the front of the cd compares them to Despised Icon and The Red Chord...ARE YOU KIDDING ME!?!!!? Those two bands are far superior to this band. Arsonists Get All The Girls just take the -core sound and add electro grind parts to it.This cd is utter poop. Stay away."
5,Best Childs Book on the Life of Jesus Christ,"This book has long been out of print - now back in print ! This is a Classic book on the life of Christ. This brief sketch is written in a plain, continuous narrative. Is is suitable for those who don't have the time and resources to pull together all of the books and papers of scholars who have written volumes on the remarkable life and death of Christ. This volume has Great Old Illustrations by the German Master Painter and Print maker Heinrick Johann Michael Ferdinand Hofmann who was born in 1824 and studied in Holland, Belgium, Germany, France and Italy. He took up residence in Dresden, where he was Professor in the Dresden Academy of Art. His artwork was purchased by the government for the Famous Dresden Gallery of Fine Art. His artwork still hangs there today. Great gift for anyone wanting a short concise story of Christ. This book is good for any catechism class or any bible study group."
5,Incubus Are The Best Band In The World,"Ever since I purchased the Morning View Sessions DVD I havn't stopped watching it. I love the music and the extra footage of the band in their house is really cool. The concert is brilliant and they play a really good selection of music. The songs consist of some off their albums Make Yourself, S.C.I.E.N.C.E and of course Morning View. If you like Incubus and you have a DVD player I stongly recomend this DVD to you. The concert is a small gig in New York. Its not really a typical Incubus concert as the crowd just sit there and the band contain themselves more than usual. I have never been to an Incubus concert as I live in New Zealand and Incubus have never been to NZ but the day they come here I will go to their concert without a doubt. Anyway back on to the subject of the DVD they play all their best songs and it is the most brilliant DVD you will ever own - BUY IT."
5,Incubus Plays Just For You,"This DVD primarily consists of an Incubus concert that aired on cable, along with extra behind the scene footage and the original video version of ""Wish You Were Here."" Technically the sound and video quality is great, the interactive menu is fun, the subtitles for the concert reveal the lyrics! I love to watch this DVD because it's like having Incubus playing for you and a few friends in an very intimate and mellow setting. It may not satisfy more hard core fans but it's a wonderful addition to an Incubus collection and a great introduction for those who don't know Incubus' work and/or assume that they don't like them."
5,Best Concert DVD To Date,"This is without a doubt the DVD to own if you wanna see how 5.1 should sound and how digital video should look. If you own an HD TV and have a 5.1 system you must have this. The crowd has been minimalized. Whoever directed this did a fantastic job, you get to see a little of what every member is doing throughout a song. Incubus mixes up the set list a lil too putting some old favorites in there (Glass, sounds great). This is the best concert DVD out right now"
4,INCUBUS,"Great dvd with a lot of their best songs live, plus behind the scenes of recording the album and such, great stuff!"
5,Excellent DVD,"The show in NY featured on this DVD is great! The extras were fun to watch too. The concert in Orlando on the 28th was amazing, buy the DVD and go see a concert! Enjoy!"
2,Don't buy it unless you like live stuff,"I bought this thinking it was going to be totally dedicated to the Morning view album... BIG DISSAPOINTEMENT! It's NOT! It's a ""stupid"" live concert.I know I will come across negatively, but for one I'm not a huge fan of Incubus and I only bought this because I thought it was 100% related to the album which I thought was quite good.....I don't go for live recordings generally and what a dissapointement to find that this had nowhere indicated on the packaging "" Live performance"" "" concert "" or anything that could possibly indicate what this truly was. What a joke.Not to exagerate but this has to be the most misleading dvd I've ever bought in my life ( shamelessly I own about 130 DvD's of just about everything ).Don't waste your money unless you're really into incubus."
1,Buy the wrong DVD,"Although a lot of people said it is good, this DVD may not attract other people. What I am looking for is a beautiful song. But the title and the cover of this DVD is much more beautiful than the concert. I think I bought the wrong DVD.I couldn't conclude the music is not good. It is just not my style. It may be amazing for many Incubus fans.To me, I just feel the DVD is very noisy. When you place the order, please check on the web about the Incubus and make sure you understand you are going to buy.Enjoy it."
5,Amazing!,"This is an absolutely amazing concert dvd. I am a long time incubus fan and i love it. I think it has the best version of ""The Warmth"" ever recorded and Brandon's vocals are dead on for every song. Even if you're not an incubus fan, you will be after watching this. Must have!"
4,great,"This dvd is a small concert in new york. The set list is very good with most songs from the morning view cd. also make sure to check out the extra stuff, also very interesting."
4,Some really hot moments!,"While I love Misty Mundae, I really thought the hottest scene on this video was before Miss Mundae even appeared. Mia Copa is the beautiful and sexy vampire, and there's a scene near the start where she brings home a lovely female tourist who delights in taking her picture. Mia talks to the woman as she removes her clothes, and I just found it incredibly sexy. As the woman begins fondling her beautiful nude body, Mia warns her that she's playing a very dangerous game. Needless to say, it ends up with Mia biting her. Still, it was a very hot scene while it lasted. Misty's later scenes were alright, but that one was the best. And then, later still, they add a guy and it pretty much goes downhill after that."
4,Erotic Vampire in Paris,this was not only a good story but it has some very sexy scenes with misty mundae. also some very interesting behind the scenes with misty on her first time in paris.
3,"Where was ""Paris?""","Paris was not featured in this film; however the city was, and some beautiful shots, I might add. It's soft-cover porn. Lovely, Misty Mundee has an erotic-nerdish quality about her that is both entertaining and unique. Great movie for both men and women who find a sexual relationship between two lovely women erotic. The plot.....what can I say, it's lame, not scary, and the only actress w/ real potential is Misty. Let's be honest. People don't get this movie for intellectual stimulation or sensation of fear. I watched the whole movie once and now, only replay my favorite scenes when I have little to do and the wife and kids are away."
1,Waste of Money,"50 cent got everyone all hyped about this album and its GARBAGE. I thought it was going to be a good CD since Technology is a hit but, Justin and Timberland made that song!Just like he said on BET, he doesn't care if you "" steal it or download it just listen to his music"". So, my suggestion is to download it and buy Kanye West's Graduation CD."
1,50 better be worshipping his producers,"This album is complete crap. I wouldn't even buy it, much less download it illegally. 50's lucky he has hot beats on the album, because that's the ""only"" thing he's got going for him. I can't stand songs that have hot beats, but weak lyrics! Crap like this is turning me away from the music I love...I can't completely agree with the idea of hip hop being dead, but its definitely on its death bed right now. Only artists like Common, Jay Z, Nas, and (potentially) Lil Wayne is keeping it alive...Folk, I'm close to never touching a radio again!"
1,embarrasing,"""I dont even gotta rap now, life is made"" -50 cent. apparently, you dont have to put out good music anymore either. 'get rich...' was a solid album, but everything hes put out since then has been worthless. what separates true talent like lil wayne from watered down sesame street rappers like 50 is originality. lil wayne juggles words and keeps you guessing about what hes gonna spit next, while 50 seems to say the same rhyme on each track with a different beat in the background. its not surprising kanye killed him in record sales, since kanyes new material is actually worth listening to. this album is beyond bad. the beats are for the most part horrible. the hooks lack originality. lyrically, this is one of the worst albums of the decade. at times it sounds like he let a third grader write the songs. its disgusting that this guy can put out such a crappy album and still sell millions. wow."
2,50 Sold Out! He Got Rich and Stopped Trying!,"This album is 50's fall from Hardcore Rap grace. I think this album is merely a shadow of Get Rich or Tryin. Kayne has moved past 50 in is authenticity and that pains me to say because I ""was"" a big 50 fan. I think 50 needs to sell his million dollar mansions and move back to NYC to find his roots again. He is too far far from reality. Sorry 50."
4,Better than The Massacre,"No way near his debut album but an improvement on The Massacre. Lyrics are not that good, its all about murdering people and doing ladies, but there's a good beat to the album. Ayo Technology is the best song in the album although its an album which you can listen from beginning to end without skipping any track. All in all not a classic but a good album anyhow."
1,My opinion as fan of 50's first 2 albums.,"Get Rich Or Die Tryin is a classic!The Massacre is part classic, part trash.Curtis is ALL TRASH! This is a wack album in every way shape and form!50 is obviously targeting the same audience as P Diddy, d4L, and Jermaine Dupri. That would be simple minded stupid people who know nothing about hip hop! You want real hip hop, check the new 9th Wonder cd, or the new Wu Tang Clan album when it drops. This ""Curtis"" album is a disgrace 2 hip hop!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Heard it all before...,"Hey, if you like the old 50 albums, you'll like this one. If you are expecting performer growth and a taste of something new you are not going to like this album. It is not as good as his older work, but similar to it and some songs sound like extended versions of some of his old hits. His style hasn't changed, he is riding on the popularity of his name, I'm a big G-Unit fan and I like the CD, but disappointed that it lacks that G-Unit edge that makes you want to listen to a song again and again. Maybe I'm crazy for expecting something more, but 50 seems to sound more like his music before he was popular than something new (or even the 50 sounds that made him popular). If you're looking for music, Kanye has a new CD. If you just want a carbon copy of the 50 old style buy this one."
3,Man Down,"Contrary to what people have been saying, this album is not complete garbage, but definitely not up to 50 standards. there are a few highlights, but for the most part it seems like 50 just got lazy. The biggest flaw on this album is the production, who picked these beats? And the Dre tracks make me question if I really do want ""Detox"" to come out. But the tracks I do like are; ""My Gun Go Off"" sounds like the 50 of old, but it's just a teaser. ""I'll Still Kill"" is a good track, Akon delivers a nice chorus. ""I Get Money"" is the only classic track on the album. ""Ayo Technology"" is the only crossover attempt that works. ""Movin' On Up"" is another track that reminds me of the old 50, but the 3rd verse is kinda weak. ""Straight to the Bank"" & ""Fully Loaded Clip"" are good songs, but they just don't bang like 50's old stuff. So, here's some advice, get the few good songs from iTunes, and go pick up Kanye's album."
4,Go get the album and stop frontin!,"This album if hott. People have been listening to so much bad hip-hop music for the last 4 years that they just dont know how to recognize good music anymore. It's 50 at his best so I dont know what else people are expecting from him when this is his 3rd solo album not counting the Get Rich or Die Tryin' Soundtrack. What makes the album great is that you can ride to it and not have to press forward. ""I get Money"" & ""Ayo Technology"" dont make the album because every other track is just as good depending on what you wanna lsiten to at that moment. The album is good music, it's hood, its gangsta, it's 50!"
2,Mediocre Album. Honestly.,"This album has a few gems early on. ""My Gun Go Off"" & ""Man Down"" for example. The song with Akon is a slow down in momentum. ""I Get Money"" is definitely a highlight.... SCRATCH THAT!!You know what? Put it this way. I like 6 songs out of 17. And ""Amusement Park"" ""Peep Show"" & ""Fire"" are HORRIBLE TRACKS. Easily in the worst songs of the year category. Once again 50, you disappoint, but the sad thing is, I'm not disappointed."
3,3rd time NOT a charm...,"this cd is pretty disapointing. this is coming from a big 50 fan. AVOID this, GET KANYE WEST. i got it and its NICE. 50 got his money, he doesnt care if it flops...hes already made over $1,000,000 TODAY(sept 11th). all he cares about is that he is getting paid and HE IS.im just HOPING that some of these songs start to wear on me. his last two albums were CRAZY... now 5 singles are already/have been out. theres 1 or 2 nice songs, and the rest so far is not the 50 i know.just feel disapointed...thats all. and i am a HUGE 50 fan..."
4,Clean?? Not really,"I was almost upset when I got the CD and it came up clean when I put it in the pc. This is not true though, with the exception of one song that is says it's censored on the case. You'll bob your head to most the tracks, there were about two or three I too much didn't care for. To each his own."
5,Outstanding CD,"I usually don't like lyrics with dirty words, but I relly like this CD. I heard it a few time online and there are several songs I love. I usually buy a CD for one or two songs and rarely find a CD in which I like moajority of the songs. K. West's got nothing on 50!"
1,I Should Have Known It Was Horrible From The Cover Art!,"I bought ""Curtis"" and ""Graduation"" By Kanye West thinking that both albums were going to be hot.....I was dead wrong when it came to 50's album! There were honestly only 3 songs on his album that were worth listening to. Those songs in my opinion were ""Ayo Technology,"" ""I Get Money,"" and ""Straight To The Bank."" Kanye won this fabricated war all the way. People don't waste your money!"
4,"4 stars, no more no less","Not really looking to get into debate, like I see others have when concerning ""curtis"". I don't know whether its because 50 is so contraversial that most of us pay attention to everything he says. I think he thrives on saying whatever it is he thinks will get the attention of the people, whether it be attacking a credible rapper like Jadakiss, or the whole kanye thing. Regardless, the fact is it works. 50 and kanye are totally different artist that look to accomplish different things with their music, so I can see why some people are having a hard time comparing them. I listened to the whole album and didn't get bored. Thats an easy four in my book. I was more impressed than disapointed with almost every song. An album that I could listen to over and over for the next year and not get bored is an easy five, which I wouldn't say about ""Curtis""(""Get Rich or Die Trying was definatly a 5."
4,"Not Bad, Not Great","First off, this CD isn't that bad. It sucks compared to Get Rich Or Die Tryin, and is comperable to The Massacre, but it isn't nearly as bad as some people are saying. The good songs are ""I Get Money"" ""Ayo Technology"" ""Come and Go"" ""Follow My Lead"" ""My Gun Go Off"" and ""I'll Still Kill"". The mediocre are pretty much all the rest. Eminem and Dre are the reason this CD isn't as good as it could be. Their lack of originality and creativity is astounding. Dre's beats are lazy and Eminem continues his downward slope into tarnishing his legacy with mediocre songs and lazy flow. Overall, this CD isn't bad. Actually, I am playing it more than Kanye's, even though Kanye's is slightly better. 50 Cent's new cd ain't bad, but it could be a lot better."
1,"Do your self a big favor, throw this out the window.","Please do your self a huge favor and buy any albums from project blowed or battle axe records more than worth your money and stop filling your head with the worst kind of garbage which this or any other commercialized rap/music has amounted to including kanye west, maintstream hits the gutter for me out my window the cds go and down into the sewer drain they flow."
1,50 keeps going downhill,50 cent has gone so far down since Power of the Dollar its ridiculous. That is actually still one of favorite CD's. Of course Get Rich or Die Trying was another great CD from him but I have no idea what happened. Even the beats on this CD weren't that good. Obviously the lyrics were terrible. Please listen to his earlier music if you are a 50 fan... both Guess Who's Back and Guess Who's Back Again.. Power of the Dollar... great CD's. All I can say is thank god he's not beating Kanye in record sales.
2,UMM what happen to you 50,"get rich or die tryin was solid album now why are you makin pop songs and claimin your the best hip hop artist out there, I GET MONEY great track but whats the rest of this bs amusment park??? u alreayd had magic stick and candy shop. idk why but u did, stop with the same stuff? i havent heard kaynes yet but prob should have listen to that first. if ur a 50 fan thats cool i mean he has some decent song but not hip hop so dont trick hip hop fans, on buyin this album when justin Timberlake came harder than u. JADA, STYLES, NAS, and JAY put some music out ASAP. please.""Yeah, you got a felony, but you ain't a predicate Never the King of New York, you live in Connecticut""wnat some real hip hop cop TERMANOLOGY, SAIGON and JOELL ORTIZ"
2,curtis,before i my download the said it was uncut but after the download i play the music and it was the clean version. good mjusic but i wanted the full effect with no breaks.
2,Nothing else to talk about,"Just like the title says, ""Nothing else to talk about but killing and money. People getting tired of hip-hop being just a vehicle to make money for these no-talent rappers. 50 cent latest is not a good investment at all. I'm selling my copy back to FYE."
2,"Well, I am not pleased. No hating but...","I took a few listens to this album, and found it to be lackluster on the lyrics and on the beats as well in some areas. 50 is back on the same old tired lyrics and subjects which further adds to the blah factor.This is not what hip-hop is about, and it's not 50's best at all. I have never been a full ""50 fan"" but this is his worst album. Perhaps he should honor the bet he made and not make any more solo albums. No hating here, but guys just download this album, I would not suggest buying it. You will be upset."
1,N**** Please !,"if i could i would give this curtis crap negative 5 stars, being in the military overseas i dont get to much amreican music, but i listened to this and i was shocked at how much crap this guy has been putting out lately, i was a fan when get rich or die tryin was out, after that he fell of and starting talking like he was that dude, now look at him he is straight garbage. i bought the graduation and it bangs"
2,just regular,"come on fifty, if your gonna be a gangsta rapper you gotta come harder than this, same stuff, compared to the old 50 this guy stepped his game way down, some of the beats r cool but he is saying nothing, i rather listen to one of his old mixtapes"
2,Not what you expect even for a mix-tape master,"Not sure what 50 is presenting here...I wanted more, he is so capable of more with his potential, but it just does not come out here."
1,Severely Lacking,"I don't know why 50 thought he could challenge Kanye and win. This CD lacks originality and substance. Same old recycled beats...same old recycled rhymes...same old rah rah shoot em up fake gangsta bull****. My thirteen year old nephew can make a better demo than this. I think the main problem is the collaborations...Timberlake, Timbaland, Robin Thicke???? Last time I checked two of those three couldn't even sing. But anyway, Akon's presence on I'll Still Kill was the only decent part of this mess. So, is this retirement thing still a go? I sure hope he was serious, because I don't know how many more of his boring tracks we can stand to hear."
1,One listen was too many!,"I have purchased every 50 cent album that has been released to date. I have never found him to be a good lyricist, but have always found the albums entertaining. The beats were always good and the flow of the album always seemed flawless. This album seemed flat almost all the way through. Obviously his life has changed greatly since the start of his career, I wish his writing would advance as his career does. This album is the same old story over and over and over and over again. Plus the flow seems stale. I honestly don't think I will even give this album a second listen. Boooooooooooooooooooooooo!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Extremely Overhyped!!!!!!,"I have never written a review before for the mere fact that most products can speak for themselves, but I couldn't hold back after listening to this album. I agree with the majority that Get Rich or Die Trying was amazing, a classic and Massacre was a strong 2nd album. Curtis however is horrendously unoriginal. I could only jam to two songs: Ayo Technology and Peep Show (that's only because Eminem put it down). Every other song is about his teflon vest and the different ways to murder. At least in the past you could bop your head to the beat.Anyone that gave this album over 2 stars is just a groupie and doesn't know music. Unfortunately 50 is highly successful at marketing and will probably outsell Kanye which would be a grave injustice to the industry of Hip Hop. I was duped into buying the cd and absolutely regret it. Don't fall for the hype!"
1,"Oh my God,?","What the hell happened with this project? Absolutely the worst album I have heard since, well the Massacre, 50 what happened, Im not a fan of u, but I did respect u, but dam, I wasted 10 bucks on this thing, I am a very unsatisfied customer."
3,disappointing,"""I get money"" is such a hot track and its by far one of the best of the year (only beat by the leaked lil wayne tracks like ""feel like dying"" and some kingspade songs from their new cd). but forget the rest of this album, its garbage.""21 Questions"" was by far the worst track on his first cd, which was otherwise a perfect 5/5. unfortunately no one seemed to have told this to 50 but it got him some radio play so he decided to make more songs like it (akon and justin timberlake?) on his 3rd cd.the real banger on the album is ""I get money"", and after that there are a couple decent songs like ""fully loaded clip"", but for the most part this is trash.3 stars for 1 song."
2,Wasted potential,"I was a little worried that this would be mostly filler like The Massacre when the singles Straight to the Bank and Amusement Park came out, but I was excited when I Get Money and AYO Technology were released- if it was all like these two it would be much better. I was disgusted by Peep Show- I deleted it and replaced it with the far superior collaboration You Don't Know from Eminem's The Re-Up on my computer. Robin Thicke was wasted on this- Follow My Lead sharing an album with Amusement Park and Peep Show was even more hypocritical than 21 Questions sharing an album with P.I.M.P. He should have released this back in May and spent the rest of the year bringing back the sound from Get Rich or Die Trying for his next album."
1,easily the worst,"50's album is terrible. ""Get Rich Or Die Trying"" is a classic in my eyes and I am not even a 50 Cent fan int he least bit. ""The Massacre"" was bad and this is the worst album of them all. Besides many of the songs beats sounding similar, his lyrics are average at best and he's so repetitive with what he says. Money, killing, being 'gangsta,' hoes and more money. Typical rap today."
3,jus keeps goin down,"I'm like 50 come on man wat happened??This is album is pretty much ok which fits my rating 3 out of 5.I noticed the difference of all of 50's albums, the first album Get Rich Or Die Tryin was his best, then his second album The Massacre was the second best, and his recent album Curtis is the third best. I notice this pattern going on its like he is jus gettin wacker and wacker by the day. Get Rich Or Die Tryin was really crazy, was his best and then coming to The Massacre was really good. But Curtis is more least then really good its jus not better. Even 50 said one time that he created a ladder for him so each time he does a new record or album he knows himself that it gotta be better than the last but its just not what i see from him in Curtis. I think lookin at this pattern if he does release another album after Curtis i think there is a big chance that its goin to suck more than Curtis."
2,"Curtis, better than The Massacre, but still no where near Gettin' Rich","Curtis, is better than his last CD, The Massacre, but still does not come close to Get Rich or Die Tryin'. If you have to choose between 50 or Kanye, without a doubt, go with Kanye."
1,SHUCKEEEED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I rushed out to get the cd because of all the hype. Even saw him on Kimmel talking up the cd a waste of money in my opinion. Still love him but the cd was not the ""50"" I remember from the beginning."
1,the mike tyson of rap!,"Didn't dude dis Ja rule for singing and having a bunch of R&B singers on his album? This guy is the Mike Tyson of Rap!!!Once a great part of rap history and now every release is worse than the last. And on top of making lame music now the dude calls people out ,gets thrashed in sales and then cries like a school girl when he loses.I had respect for him because he had some burners on Get Rich and was a beast on the mixtape circuit but now,like Tyson, he has become irrational and emotional when he loses a battle.Now he just wants to quit. Nobody is responding to his dis records anymore and his sagging sales accordingly.I guess he'll always have more than a few fans but with the sore loser role, he just lost one."
3,Got Rich...No longer Tryin',"I listen to ""Curtis"" and I get the impression that 50 Cent isn't hungry anymore, so he doesn't rap like he used to. Maybe now that he's rich it's hard for him to connect to the streets; his mansion out in Connecticut is a long way from Southside Queens. From now on there should be a platinum limit on gangsta rappers. Once you've dropped a platinum album you can no longer rap about gangsta s****, cuz at the end of the day that's not the lifestyle that you live anymore. I'm not gonna lie and say that this album is garbage, but it definitely isn't his best. Maybe if he hadn't dropped so many singles before the album released I'd feel different. The best songs on the album are already singles ""I Get Money"", ""Straight to the Bank"", ""Amusement Park"", ""Ayo Technology"".Top 3 tracks(that aren't already singles):1. I'll Still Kill2. Curtis 1873. All of MeBottom 3 tracks:1. Fire2. Touch the Sky3. Fully Loaded Clip"
3,"Ok, nothing great.","Bought this cd on release day. I had been a fan of his ""Get Rich or Die Trying"" album, but wasn't too impressed with ""The Massacre,"" apart from a few good songs.I was extremely disappointed with this cd at first. I found it extremely bland and nearly unlistenable. After listening through it once, I literally shelved it till a few days ago. Upon a 2nd listen, the album is actually pretty good. I'm not sure what made me change my mind, but I now listen to it a lot more often.It's nothing special, but it's not terrible. 3 out of 5 is what it gets.Now, for a real cd, check out T.I.'s ""Paper Trail"" if you haven't already. THAT'S an album."
3,not bad but not good enough,the only thing wrong with this album is its just like the first two. every song is about the same thing and its time for fifty to go in a new direction. if some one else would of droped this album it would get better reviews.
2,Disappointment,Ive been a 50 fan since his mixtapes. This album is nothing like his past he strays away from the club beats that basically made him. I cant believe he challenged kanye knowing how weak the album was. I listened to the album then a couple days listened again but i just cant seem to get that bob your head feeling. I honestly dont think he gave it his best on this album and if he did then i guess i wont be buying any more future albums.
2,what happened man,"damn man, it seems every album he comes out with since get rich or die tryin has gotten worse, get rich was the best album, i still listen to that ish even to this day, the massacre was aight, not as good as his first but okay now he got his 3rd album and it dont sound that good to me, i can hear the difference in his voice. i can tell he got his money right this time just by listening to his songs but somthing seems to be missing in these songs, he talks aboult materialism alot in his songs, (hell, 2 of his singles thats out now is straight to the bank and i get money, i like the latter a whole lot better) and of couse he talks about the thug in him. it just dont sound as good 2 me as his first album or even his second album did. i still like dude because he got that business mind and he is about his money but i wish he can go back to his fisrt album roots."
2,I thought I was the only one,"I never liked 50 cent. I dont know why maybe because they made a movie about his life or MTV plays only the sugar coated, teen friendly songs he sings. The first four songs are really good, surprised me. Then he sings with Dre and you think it would be a classic, wrong. Its repetitive and boring. Then a duet with Justin Timberlake? What the hell is that about? Talk about a gangster. Robin Thicke? Skip. Then a few good songs then a duet with Eminem. A very embarrassing and forgettable song by two good artist. Then Nicole Scherzinger duet? Are you friggin kidding me? What was 50 smoking? The rest of tracks are alright but nothing stands out. I cant believe that I bought this cd. The first four songs are good but the bubblegum hip pop duets are stupid. Cd is a mixed bag, he should sing solo. Thats when he does his best work."
4,G-Unit's Leader,"Curtis Jackson aka 50 Cent has taken his solo act to another level. C'mon, people! Whether you like 50 or not, this album is very interesting to me. 50 Cent's still ""getting rich and die trying."""
1,His Worse and more to come,"50 Cent is wack.His first album was a classic and after that he has followed in Ja Rule footsteps the same guy he destroyed. He has nothing else to offer to the game. only thinks of himself and thinks he is the best MC in the game when he's not, he's not even the best in New York or in his own crew G-Unit, Lloyd Banks flow is better. Go away we need real hip hop back.1 Luv I wish i could give this half a star cause i didn't even buy it i could tell it was that bad , the only song that was hot was I Get Money."
1,"If Hip Hop Is Dead, This Is What's Killing It","This is really genuinely poor stuff from 50 Cent, a rapper who's career can be charted from gaining attention on the back of criticising other people, to hopping on the back of Eminem and riding him all the way to the bank. There's very little in the way of discernible talent here.Yet again, we have an exercise in lame self-indulgence and adolescent fantasy, as we're expected to spend our quality time listening to a man who thinks owning a large arsenal of weapons is some kind of credential.Hip Hop is not dead - there's some really good stuff out there, but you're going to have to look past this kind of tripe to find it."
1,Album cover says it all.......,"He was thinking, ""D**n, Game ruined my career."" When those two broke off from each other, The Game annihilated 50 on his mixtapes. He made a lot of people open their eyes to what 50 had become......a gimmick. Don't get me wrong, ""Get Rich or Die Tryin"" is a certified classic. But like Game says, ""50 got rich and stopped tryin"" and it really shows on this album. I'm glad I heard it before even thinking about buying it, otherwise this review would've been a lot uglier. It goes to show.....when you build your career on beefing with people (50 vs Ja Rule, Fat Joe, Jadakiss, etc), sooner or later somebody is gonna take you out. Funny, 50 has become the exact sort of artist that he used to make fun of Ja Rule being (singing on hooks, wannabe love songs, pop hits, etc). I guess what goes around comes around......"
1,Nursery Rhymes is this is what 50 has become?,"The only rapper to do nursery rhymes and do it well is Nelly.I enjoyed 50's first cd and ran to buy the second when it debuted,I should have slowed my roll.Wanksta had a catchy beat and that was about it.So,I listened to a friend's ""Curtis"" the third cd and when did 5o need the likes of Justin Timberlake and Timbaland to duet on his cd's???Mary J Blige????Yeah and he had the nerve to twist lips about JaRule on J.Lo's single...how absurd!You have got to be kidding me...this cd has nice beats but rapping about money on almost every other song gets little tiring and boring.This CD is nothing but a big fat YAWN..........."
2,Disappointing - Not Enough Dr. Dre input!,"It seems like 50 is slowly drifting away from Dr. Dre's beats and input. This album suffers from that. Unlike Eminem, 50 Cent can't be successful without solid, focused production that only Dr. Dre can provide. The only super solid songs on this album are the ones that Dre produced. Purchas with caution if you're a Dre fan."
3,Good effort; lacks energy of the first two,"I think that Curtis by 50 Cent is a good effort, but it lacks some energy. The first two albums he made had the beats and attitude. But about 70 per cent of this album is strong, while 30 per cent have a certain weakness. The standout here is Fire, a sizzling number that he did with Nicole Scherzinger and Young Buck. The next standout is the tornado heavy and catchy I Get Money. The numbers with Dr. Dre and Eminem are good. But some other numbers wear thin with his tiresome thug themes; it gets old really quick. He really made this album for the clubs, because many tracks are dance heavy, even in the middle of the CD. He didn't do this to score major hits. I don't think he pushed himself enough on this album like the other too, but this album has a good chance to sell in the millions."
3,Above average.,Ok so I'm a huge 50 Cent fan I'm down with whatever it is 50 does. This CD is a solid effort I think he just kinda rushed. He probably had a garbage cd about to drop got scared had it pushed back 3 months so he can rush and make somthing happen. 50 is way better lyrically than what he shows on this cd. But I still listen to it alot I like it but again huge fan I can see where a casual listener could say this is trash. It's a even mix of hard core gangster rap and pop. Lyrics weak. Hate to say it but Kanye wins this battle fair and square.
3,Middle Of The Road,"Its a tough cookie this album, i was expecting an awful lot from it as 50Cent has always delivered on his previous outings. Im not saying this album is bad, i just had a sense that something was missing. A good few standout tracks but nothing to set it apart form the other music in the charts. Good for a casual fan but it wont win him any new fans."
1,Disappointing,"Nothing new: Fiddy is still a killer, still wants to shoot you, but now he brings in all his famous friends and the CD still sucks. This album is so bad you'd have thought Tony Yayo was the artist. Compare this to Game's last album and you will see what Fiddy once was."
1,Wow this is trerrible,"I love 50 cent but this album is bad. Same old unimaginative junk. Cars, Women im rich and your not so listen to me tell you. Its cool the first time but im over, buy kanye if you want something your ears wont fall asleep to."
3,A REAL REVIEW,"Okay, Get Rich Or Die Tryin was 50's best work. However, I think that this album is better than the Massacre. I bought both Kanye's new album and 50's album and in my opinion 50's is better. Let me explain why. Kanye's new album is nothing but samples. Take the ""old"" songs away from Kanye and what do you have.....a weak rapper. Listen, I am not a huge fan of either of these two, but I do think 50's album is better and that is saying a lot. Honestly, rap is on the downside and the rivalry that these two stirred up is good for hip hop and the culture that I love."
1,PLEASE STOP KILLING HIP HOP!!!!!!!,"With Graduation by Kanye West, Curtis by 50 Cent and American Gangster by Jay-Z the nails in the coffin of Hip-Hop are being firmly hammered down.The fact the people can find any redeeming features in any of the tracks contained on these appalling Albums is beyond me. All I can do is list some real Hip-Hop Albums that prove that quality lives on and mediocrity simply falls into obscurity.TUFF CREW -BACK TO WRECK SHOPN.W.A - 'Efil4Zaggin'HEAVY D - BLUE FUNKMAIN SOURCE - BREAKING ATOMSSON OF BAZERK - Bazerk, Bazerk, Bazerk"
3,What a bummer,"I can't stand 50 cent anymore the only reason I got the CD was for the Justin Timberlake song,hahhaha"
1,Wankster,"So the minstrel show is back, in all it's black-face glory, pimpin' stereotypes, a languid delivery of mush-mouth diatribes, faux-gangsta stereotypes, and as if originality is the real crime, basking in the `keeping it real' cliché's plump with pedestrian skills. Not to mention a fat coward (he reneged on his promise to retire if Kanye beats him via soundscan). Wankster, indeed. My grade: C-"
4,I like it!,"This album may be different from his previous two, but he's still the same 50 Cent. The only thing I didn't like was the fact that most of the album was leaked, yet much of the song never changed. Next time he promotes an album I want to hear a completely new album, not half a new album and half of songs I already heard on the radio and streets."
5,Ferrari Is Back In The Building.,"I was really surprised when i heard ""Curtis"", And this is the hardcore 50 cent that i been waiting to hear since GRODT, not that soft ""Massacre"" album. Anyway there's alot of hating to this cd, And haters just like 50 said: ""I'm laughing straight to the bank with this. Moving on with the record from begining to the end, It's no classic, but it's a great comeback. Song's like ""Movin On Up"", ""Man Down"", ""Touch The Sky"", ""Come & Go"", ""Curtis 187"", And people are hating on this album while kanye is making that dumb robot song mixing hip hop with techno how lame. Between this and Graduation, The gorilla beats the teddy bear. Graduation was so weak lyrically kanye blows, I respect him alot better as a producer, And thats final."
2,a compendium of theories,Poor book really I tried to use it but I lost six months the main strengh is that the book is a compendium of theories so you can get some ideas however the book is a tribune of the two authors' theory it is not a very objective course on growth theory check the next Daron acemoglu book it is betterEdit your post:Poor book really I tried to use it but I lost six months the main strengh is that the book is a compendium of theories so you can get some ideas however the book is a tribune of the two authors' theory it is not a very objective course on growth theory check the next Daron acemoglu book it is a better and more balanced view on growth theory
3,.......provocative and insightful,"This is a book that keeps on giving long after you put it down. Many of us know we abhor discrimination and intolerance, yet fail to understand our lofty ideals are perched on a wide ledge of privilege. Why do people in the ghettos burn their domains? Why haven't more cases of equal opportunities for African-Americans been realized? What is a concerned white person supposed to do? Which is heterosexuality - a default or a choice? Why does the work of individuals in the caring professions become devalued as they strive to meet society's most prominent altruistic goals? This collection of provocative suggestions has the potential to reframe our debates about current issues in the American experience."
4,"Still, The Reigning Princess","Yolanda is back! The theme of this latest offering is gratitude and victory. It is no secret that within the last few years, Ms. Adams' marriage was challenged and even though the challenge, Yolanda expresses her victorious faith here with a fervor and vigor that only the Holy Spirit can grant. She accepts production help on this CD from Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, as well as ""Big Jim"" Wright. Sure to catch your attention is ""Victory"", ""Be Blessed"", ""Tonight"" written by and featuring her ""homeboy"", Kirk Franklin, the inspiring ""Lift Him Up"", featuring dear friends, Donnie McClurkin and Mary Mary and last, but not least, one of favorite songs (originally performed as a duet in the mid 90's with Crystal Lewis), ""This Too Shall Pass."" Yolanda has given us many passionate projects over the years, but this one paints, for you and I, a more definitive picture of what exists in the heart of the reigning Princess of Gospel music."
4,Great CD,"This is an excellent CD. Yolanda's voice powerfully takes flight on every song. The songs are great and the music clear. I gave this CD 4 stars only because it wasn't what I was looking for and I wanted others who were looking for the same thing to be aware. I wanted something with a more stirring contemplative quality. This one has faint flavors of it here and there but not enough of it to meet what I was looking for.This is a powerful praise CD that encourages folks toward Jesus with soaring testimony and thanks. If you are looking for praise music then this is the one for you. However if like me, you are looking for something that digs a little deeper spiritually try some of Yolanda's other CD's."
5,Great CD,"This Cd minister to your heart, mind and soul in more ways than one of what you need it to do. I hate that I waited this long to purchase it but it still a wonderful Cd. My favorites are victory, day by day, its gonna be nice is a favorite. I don't think that you will regret purchasing this cd because better late than never. God had to place the song in my spirit in a dream before I purchase the cd it relaxing and very peaceful in so many ways."
3,Oldie But Goodie,Ha! I just had to get this tape in my library. It's not a great movie but I thought it was back in the day. You don't get to see the monster until the end but it's definitely amusing.
2,Weird,"The movie was ok, the story line was presented ok, if you like really weird horro its a good watch."
1,Not worth a Watch,"I am fairly easy to please in the horror genre, and I have sat through some real turkeys ( in the opinion of other people) and yet I find that this so-called horror film is the only one I can easily say has no redeeming qualities.Even as good as Cassavetes is, he can't redeem a really horrible script, and I don't mean so horrible its funny kind of ""horrible""... this is just not entertaining, not scarey, and just a plain waste of time.This film thoroughly deserves any and every negative comment about it. Do not waste your time, even if you like straight splatter films, this film is just a waste of time."
4,the ultimate impaler!,"what a story! a monster runs amok through a small town destroying women with his love tool. You would think Troma would have come up with this one except I know that it is an actual(supposedly) story in the bible. In a flashback scene the monster makes some monks airborne as he rendevous with a tied up naked witch and we get to see one big inward ""thrust"". This movie could have been a joke but because of john cassavetes dramatic support ensuring tension from beginning to end, good effects including the creepy devil monster, and plenty of unexpected scares, you get a unique film experience. The film score brilliantly complements every scene. Naked women's asses also complement with two very nice ones that I can remember. The only thing that bothered me was it ended too soon and left us hanging. 16x9 picture from elite is very nice."
4,It's always refreshing,"It's always refreshing could see a good scary movie using your imagination from time to time, instead grafic, gore violence like today's movies."
2,Kindle Version Editing Terrible,"The mistakes are so distracting. If anyone at Amazon wants to check it out, I bookmarked a large number of obvious mistakes.I don't know how these books are being translated to Kindle but I do know they are not being translating well."
3,Odd low budget black comedy shows technical promise.,"Connie Sprouts rents what has to be the most disgusting hotel room on the planet as a safe haven to harbor her 'offspring.' Turns out she is not quite human and is a fugitive from a greedy corporation than wants to use the alien lifeform hiding in her body for military weapons research.Technically the movie is strongly made, well photographed and visually mounted. Where it fails is in the acting, which ranges from promising amateurishness to flat out horrid, and in the screewriting, which is unfocused in its exposition, fuzzy in some of its characterizations, and jerky in moving the story forward (perhaps this was a originally a short subject expanded to feature length?). Those interested in a Basket Case type scenario with plenty of off the wall humor might find something to like here, those wanting something a little more disturbing and/or frightening are going to have to look elsewhere. Recommended to fans of the out there, but no one else."
5,Outstanding Story in the finest Irish (and American) Traditions,"""Oh, Play That Thing,"" is the followup to ""A Star Called Henry"" and is entirely complementary to the first part of this three part trilogy. I can't wait for part 3. The characters in these first two parts of the trilogy are unique but oh so fitting to the best (and worst) of Irish and American cultures and mythology. Love the tie in with Louis Armstrong, New York, Chicago, and other places (not to spoil the story before you read it). Roddy Doyle has a great ear and ability to write dialogue fitting of places and time. He combines the toughness of life with the greatness of life in people who live it fully and then some. Really enjoyed this book, and before it A Star Called Henry and can't wait for the next and final in the trilogy."
1,Not a good follow-up to the first book in the series,"One of the reasons that I read series is because I hope that the author will keep the same voice from book to book. In this, 'The Last Roundup' series let me down. Only once during the first one hundred pages, did I sense the same voice: when Henry Smart is interviewed by the immigration agent upon his arrival to America. Actually, the writing style in this book reminded me of another book about the jazz subculture in the 1930s, Half-Blood Blues, which I also abandoned. Too bad."
2,disappointing sequel,"Very confusing and unbeleivable sequel to the wonderful A Star Called Henry. I enjoyed the section when Henry was with Louis Armstrong, but the rest of the book did not live up to the quality of A Star Called Henry, and it was often hard to follow what was actually going on. I frequently had to back up a few pages because I thought that I had missed something. I made myself finish the book but honestly, I did not enjoy reading it and I was glad to be finished. I hope that the next book is more focused and that Doyle goes back to the style of prose that made me such a fan of Henry in the first place."
1,Oh Play That Thing,"Was very impressed with this Author's first book, ""A star called Henry"", which contained historical value and a good plot. This book was rubbish in my opinion."
1,Roddy Doyle misses the mark,I was very disappointed with this book. I have read almost all of Roddy Doyle's books and lovedthem. This book is so disjointed and confusing that I could not follow the story line. The characters were undefined and random so you never really connect with any of them. I stopped reading toward the middle of the book. Ifigured that I gave it enough of a chance. I would not reccomend this book.
3,Worth a read,"This was an all-around good read, but not as great as ""A Star Called Henry."" Also, you have to have read the first book for much of the second to make sense. If you like Roddy Doyle it will still be an interesting read."
1,Hated It!,"The first book was not great, but at least good. This is so dreadful that I couldn't even make it through it. Nonsensical plot, Non-existent plot, Nothing plot. Those terms all describe this one. This isn't worth reading; whether you've read the first one or not. Doyle can be so much better than this!!!"
2,A big disappointment after the brilliance of A Star Called,"I read and loved Volume 1 of this trilogy and it inspired me to leave my first ever review on Amazon.What a huge disappointment this book was after the brilliance of A Star Called Henry. The plot seems to miander aimlessly though Henry's new life in America with the author using every opportunity to offer some hidden meaning to his words through over artsy pros. It's possible that some deep thinking English majors might like this approach but for me it was dull, difficult to read and monotonous.If you have read A Star Called Henry, I highly recommend you give this follow-up a miss so as not to spoil your impressions of the story."
4,Great food for Goldfish,My goldfish love this food but the only problem is my fish sometimes have trouble eating it because the flakes are so big. But besides that my fish love this food and it stays fresh for a long time.
1,shocked and not pleased,"Was very unhappy with game. Since Truth Be Told was so wonderful, I assumed this game would be also. WRONG!Would have sent it back but it wasn't worth the effort.Was the first thing I ever ordered from Amazon that I was unhappy with."
1,Better than nothing... barely,"This is a poorly written book that seems to miss the fact that it is aimed at beginners. As mentioned in other reviews, the author attempts to add humor to his writing. That can be a good thing when done correctly, but is frustrating in the wrong context. Near the beginning of the book, his advice for the reader having trouble with the project is something like ""wave a dead chicken over it"". Could be funny, unless you're desperately trying to figure out what went wrong. There are many typos in the book (though I don't think I've ever read a programming book that didn't have at least one). The use of poor quality black-and-white photos also doesn't help, especially if the color of a wire is important.I think most readers will learn something from this book, but it is still a poor investment and not the best choice for those trying to learn microcontroller programming. Save your money and shop around."
1,A big disappointment,"I was very excited about this book after reading the first sample chapter. However, the rest of the book seems that it was rushed to press. The text contains many errors, important concepts are inadequately explained if at all, and many of the pages are simply code listings found on the CD. If I had not asked for the book as a gift, I would return it."
2,"Great promise, mixed results","I purchased this book and ""Embedded C Programming and the Atmel AVR "" by Barnett, since feedback went both ways. I must say this book appears rushed, has some crucial errors (especially for first timers), typos, poor layout in places, and a weak index. However, it does tie into the WinAVR compiler, and for those that need help there, the book is useful. All examples use the ATMEGA 169, as expected. Barnett's examples mostly use the 90S8515 (some ATMEGA 163), with the CodeVisionAVR compiler."
5,wealth of info - even without background,"I'm a mechanical engineer without background in electrical engineering or software engineering and this book literally provided me with a wealth of valuable information beyond just the AVR Butterfly doing some great tricks. Some reviews seem to suggest the book is unclear, but before reading I literally barely understood what a bit is, and Pardue illuminates all of that with examples that you implement right away. I have a mechanical background, but the stuff the book deals with is ubiquitous and helpful all over.Yes - you have to read and think and re-read, but C and microcontrollers are complex inventions accomplish a huge variety of tasks - which you'll actually be able to start doing with this book. I recommend it."
4,GRIM,This album magically impressed me by the clarity of the lyrics and the deep sensual drums. A must listen to for those who are not impressed with rock
4,Great debut album,"On the Ass Ponys scale of Rock, this one ranks in last... but that's fine by me as this is one great band. There is not one bad song on any of their albums so this is a must have to complete the collection."
3,"Define ""young person""......","I got these stories to listen to with my son who is 9 and likes to listen to biography in the car. Although I enjoyed them, he really wasn't old enough for them yet. I'm guessing that he'd be ready for these stories about 12 or older."
4,Buy it elsewhere,Don't buy it from Amazon. They want you to pay for 2 day shipping or say it won't get there until after Christmas. Buy from Barnes and Noble. Same price and free shipping gets it to you in 4 days. Stay away from Amazon!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,This man should be President,Great Book! I leave this on my coffee table and refer to it almost every night. If McCain doesn't run in '08 I'm writing him in.
2,"Good seller, o.k. book, questionable author...","The book shipment and packaging was great. The condition of the book was just as expected. The seller delivers as promised. The book itself is a joke... John McCain is just another liar, as are the others in DC. He didn't write this book, his long-time aid did. I don't think I'd buy this book, again, but I'd buy from the seller."
2,Cannot read this material to a child!!,"I was excited when ordering this book. I planned to read the stories to my granddaughter, who is llThe wording of the stories is not in a form a child could understand!! Surely McCain could have written the stories that he instructs parents to ""read these to your children,"" with words children can understand!! I am a college graduate and had to look up some of the words. The idea is great, the product isn't."
5,Excellent...Timeless Book for Generations.,"I originally got this book for myself which is signed by Senator McCain and I enjoyed it so much I wanted to share it. I bought one for my friends with families, young and old. Everyone loved it! I am really excited that I found it. It's a great gift for anyone. I have been asked where I bought it so other's could also give it as a gift. You'll find quotes and stories from many prominent people like Benjamin Franklin to Mother Teresa. I highly recommend this for everyone!Character Is Destiny: Inspiring Stories Every Young Person Should Know and Every Adult Should Remember"
4,Yes breating technique is important,"I started taking yoga last month and started to learn about the importance of proper breathing. Dr. Weil perhaps overplays the ability of proper beathing to prevent illness, however, since breating is something you are always doing, you might as well learn the best techniques to make you feel better."
5,Informative and compelling,"This book provides an extensive account of contemporary research in the field of learning and individual differences. Although somewhat dense and directed at an academic audience, it provides the reader with a feeling for the many points of consensus and controversy surrounding the elusive concept known as intelligence. Marvellous (though tough) reading!"
4,Great for all ALW fans!,"Not a typical Webber musical, but still it is worth it. ""Whistle"" sounds like it is from the old Webber ""style"" that brought us Joseph and other ""simpler"" musicals. The story however, is just as powerful and as moving as any another of his works, even though the music isn't as dramatic or developed. One thing that does take some getting used to is the amount of dialogue that was included on the recording, and the accents used somehow just don't work. Other than that, it is worth it and I give a ""thumbs up"" recommendation."
3,Did anybody else notice this?,"Did anybody notice that Tire Tracks... and (i think) English Girls from Song and Dance are THE SAME SONG! I am not sure if English Girls is the right title, but if you own the cd, listen to it. Some songs are remakes of old ones. I hear a lot of melodies from Aspects of Love and Cats in this musical. I thinks Andrew is running our ot creativity."
3,The story is better than the music,"I was very excited when I saw this CD because i am a big fan of Lloyd Webber's work. However, when I began listening to it I was a little disapppointed. There are some good songs on here but most of the music is derivative of other songs he's previously done. It sounds very similar to Jesus Christ Superstar, Starlight Express, Song and Dance, and even Martin Guerre (which he didn't do). Marcus Lovett was a poor choice for lead actor. His voice isn't very strong and I feel that he ruins every song he sings. The story is compelling and because of it I actually enjoy listening to the CDs. I would really like to see this show on stage to see how it's translated. I have a feeling that I would like it more if I could see it as well as hear it."
4,Great music!,"This is a really great soundtrack. The songs, while still have that Lloyd Webber sound to them, have a real Steinman/meatloaf sound to them. Not your usual Lloyd Webber musical. I really recommend this album."
3,Great Music! Southern Accents?,"I saw the show in D.C. and was blown away. I waited for a disc for a while, because the show was shelved for a bit. When I saw that the show went back into production in London, I knew that the disc would come out soon. I have purchased it.., and with the exceptions of the horrible accents, the music is still there. I just can't wait for the Broadway recording :)"
3,Welcomed but lacking,"I finally bought this soudntrack and I recommend it far above the pop album with Tina Arena. This is a good soundtrack. The plusses: ""A Kiss is a Terrible Thing to Waste"", ""No Matter What"", and ""Annie Christmas"". The minuses: the horrilbe attempts at a southern accect and the straight- no soul ensemble nubmers. Mr. Webber has a few great original tunes here. It leaves you wanting more. Tunes like ""If Only"" and ""Whistle Down the Wind"" are somewhat repetive and makes you wish that the music went somewhere like in ""A Kiss"". Overall, this is a welcomed endevour to an Andrew Lloyd-Webber fan. I recommend fans to purchace it. But ultimately, we need to wait till it comes to America and it's revamped."
3,"Some good songs, but the dialogue is painful","Lloyd Webber's title tune is excellent. It's aplesant score, butI would have preferred in away from the dialogue. The Southern accents seem overdone. It is also necessary to read the booklet before listening, otherwise you may not realize that ""Swallow"" is the main character and not a recommendation. I never want to hear the name ""Ay-moss"" (Amos) in my life again."
1,Never received item,I rated the item low because I have not received this product yet - I hope I will in the near future
5,One of Andrew Lloyd Webber's Most Touching Works,"As a musical theatre and Lloyd Webber fan, I was very anxious to hear the cast album of his latest musical. 'Whistle Down the Wind' has a very lovely, parable-like story, and beautiful music. The performances of everyone on this album are very good, the singing is fantastic.The accents are mostly overdone, but it's not like Americans do a good job on British accents.The best thing to recommend this musical is the music. It is lush, powerful, and very different from Lloyd Webber's other shows. Don't miss out on this album."
5,Andrew Lloyd Webber musicals don't need reviews!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"You can say I'm an Lloyd Webber genius. But if you think his shows are good this one is just as good. I have seen the only two productions of this show. I saw the try-out in Washington D.C. in 1996 at the National Theatre. It was great!!! That wasn't even the real production. Then, I saw the World Primiere of it in London at the Aldwych Theatre on July 1, 1998. The set design was incredible!!!!!! The set was unbeliavably creative. The score was typically great for Lloyd Webber."
4,Some of the prettiest songs ever...,"I have to admit that the accents are bad, and that the songs are repetative, but there are some songs in this musical that are some of the sweetest I have ever heard! I tremendously loved ""Try Not To Be Afraid"", and I havn't heard one person do it justice! I love the haunting harmonies in that song, and the beautiful vocal range of The Man. Another song I loved was ""Whistle Down the Wind"". Although, I am not too fond of Lottie Mayor singing it. I saw her live, and think that she is much better that way. There are some songs, though, I am not too fond of. These include ""Wrestle With the Devil"", ""Safe Haven"", and ""I Never Get What I Pray For"". I seriously thought the show started out a bit hoky, but I understand that they had to set up the conflict of religion into the plot. I like this show, I really do."
5,AMAZING!,"Alright, the thing that bugged ...me when I first heard this musical is the bad southern accents. Makes you want to pull your hair out. If it wasn't for the AMAZING music, I probably would not have given it a second listen. After the second or third listen, the accents become more and more bearable. Then without warning, it starts to sound just right. Anyway, besides the accents, this has got to be on the top 3 of Andrew Lloyd Webber's musicals. ""Phantom of the Opera"" and ""Evita"" (movie version) are the other two. The music is very catchy and brings tears to your eyes, the same time it makes you smile with the perfect dissanant harmonies. My favorite songs are, ""Tire Tracks and Broken Hearts"" and ""A Kiss is a Terrible Thing to Waste."" Makes you want to jump up and sing your lungs out. This is a great, great, great, great musical and you need to reward yourself by listening to this masterpiece. Andrew, please do more like this....please."
1,"Well, I read the book first so...","...maybe that's why I just couldn't take the musical. One of my problems is that Swallow is, really, just too old to believe that the man is Jesus. And the other children, at least musically, are marginalized. We don't get a good sense of their characters through this CD. For those of you who complain that the plot is pointless, the original M.H. Bell novel might clear some of that up. For the musical, a lot of the original clarifying points were lost...And the accents ARE pretty bad, huh."
2,Ack... eject!,"You see the name Andrew Lloyd Webber and assume it can't be horrible right? WRONG! When I put this CD into my player I was horrified. Some of the music was ok, but most of it was awful and cheesy. The London cast putting on southern accents are really bad. The lead character Swallow, has a voice made for a high school production, but not a soundtrack like this. This is not typical ALW, Musical Theater, or good music. This is good milk gone sour. I do however like the voice of the character Amos (pronounced in this CD as AY-MOSS) which is why my favorite song is ""Tire Tracks and Broken Hearts"" I suggest this for collectors, and ALW fans, but don't expect the normal, this is a new rock-christian ALW."
1,zeek didn't like this cd,"the music in this soundtrack is gorgeous, the voices are refreshing, but the story bothers the heck out of me. what was andrew loyed webber saying with this play? i am a big fan of webbers art, i consider him a genious as far as music goes, but as much as i like the songs in this cd (like Whistle Down the Wind, and If Only) i don't like to listen to something that bares such a fowl and obviously negative view of God and christianity. if that doesn't bother you, than i guess this cd is a great part of a collection, but as for myself, i can't listen to it anymore."
4,i wont speak for the other reviewers,"but every time this film is shown at a theater, i always see it because i love to find out what makes a poet a poet and what creative processes they use to make poetry...jim carroll's segment is good..he has one of those reading voices that you could pick out of a crowd...amiri baraka does a masterful job with his tribute poem to larry neal and bob marley called "" wailers "" jayne cortez's "" i see chano pozo "" is musicially brilliant.bukowski's segments are cool, but it would've been nice if he had read a poem...he's okay as a poet. but there's no mystery to his work...its too easy to ""get""..."
2,I expected more,I expected more. I purchased this film along with Slamnation and Fooling with Words. The film barely kept me engaged and the poetry and performances were lackluster. Fooling with Words gives a more comprehensive look at the craft with poets that are not relics of an age almost forgotten. Slamnation is a must have and will wake you up from the coma that Poetry in Motion might cause.
4,Fun game with the right people,"This game adds in a lot of missing words that really make the game a lot more fun. The only downside to this pack is that there are a lot of cards that have ""&"" as the word. They aren't the best, but are useable. Overall though, if you like the original Party Box, this makes a great add on to it."
1,Bad & Worse,"Our whole family loves Apples to Apples! We know each others' judging tendencies, so know whether to select a literal or metaphoric parallel, or a funny or ironic card. We passionately argue our positions or we pander, whichever wins the round.We were excited for this expansion pack, having played our other cards into predictability. But these are so awful! My wife described using them as being on 'a forced march'. Most of the cards are pairs of words, e.g., Surf & Turf, Chicken & the Egg, The Birds and Bees, which are virtually worthless juxtaposed against their supposed counterparts: Dazed and Confused, Bright and Shining, Short and Stout. Mom, Dad, two college-age daughters and a middle school son all thought the expansion pack to be worse than irritating.We are so disappointed, because the original cards are so creative."
3,Expansion box cards all too similar,If you love this game - do not buy these cards unless you intend to incorporate them little by little. The cards all seemsed the same.
3,A little disappointed...,I am a huge fan of Apples to Apples but this expansion pack was a little lacking in quality red cards. Too many X & X red AND green cards. The original deck is much better than this expansion deck. With that said if you play this game a lot you'll want to have more cards so buy this deck and cull out the cards you don't like then combine decks...that's what we've done and it's worked pretty well.
3,"Good, but just not the same","I had the original game for years, and once the expansion came out I was excited to have new cards, and although it gave the game more words/options, the choices were just not as great as the first round. Still my favorite game and worth the money for any serious A to A player."
4,Superb power metal from a legend in the making.,"A fantastic act,Steel Prophet,formerly known as Hard Prophet,combine the best of Iron Maiden,Priest,Fates,into a white-hot melting pot dominated by sheer power,precision,intelligent lyrics and,as this album inspired by Ray Bradbury's famous novel demonstrates,very ambitious ideas.We'll be hearing a lot more from this amazing West Coast power act!"
2,Misleading description,"The description for this product caused me to purchase it after 90 days of getting inaccurate shipments from HP. Once I received this item from the seller I informed him that it was inaccurately described. To date, I received neither a response or refund of my $10. I know that's a small amount but the frustration of trying to get the appropriate item from several vendors unsuccessfully cost me more than $10. I finally found the correct cable from Cables To Go for $30, wrote a commendation to the supervisor of the exceptional customer service representative that took the time to care about my request. Sometimes good customer service and honesty can be hard to find."
4,In the pantheon of films from British comedy's golden age,"Terrible special effects (witness the pixilated intertwining of automobile radio antennas,err... I mean car wireless aerials)actually improve this Ealing films gem. Seemingly more off the cuff than Kind Hearts and Coronets and without the social commentary of Man in the White Suit, but beautiful in it's own right. The scene with Alfie Bass sitting bewildered as a small time burglar required to become an instant pavement artist is one of my favourites."
4,Get your geegaws here,"More than just a movie for Audrey Hepburn fetishists (yes, she has one line at the beginning), this is a smart, short, comedy, with all sorts of clever scenes, including some hilariously ironic scenes involving the police. Alec Guiness is perfect as the nerdy bank clerk who dreams of the perfect heist, and all the supporting characters, even the bratty little girls, are perfect. I especially liked the ""auditioning"" of crooks in the search for new co-conspirators."
4,What we want is not always what we dream of...,"A retired bank clerk retells his life story of how he reached his goal of riches for a stranger in a bar in Rio de Janeiro. When he was bank clerk he meticulously oversaw the banks gold bar production and transportation. Eventually, he intended to steal this gold whenever an opportunity arose. One day a man moved into the same building in which he lived and the man's profession seemed to fit into the bank clerks dubious plan. In addition, he traps two accomplices for the plan and they put the plan into action. However, something seems fishy as the story unfolds. The Lavender Hill Mob is a well performed dark comedy about the theft of a hefty sum in gold that brings the audience to ponder the film in retrospect."
2,Not Watchable,"I'm a huge movie buff, love Alec Guinness, and enjoy offbeat comedies, but my kids and I simply couldn't get into one.Aneil"
1,Sweet but dull,"I never caught this on late night television or was willing to pay the more expensive price for the video elsewhere. Now I'm stuck with a sweet, but VERY dull video. And no, I don't care for graphic violence and much prefer comedies, but this movie just dragged on and on and on. I never laughed out loud watching this, but have to admit I did smile a few times. I was also disappointed in the quality of my video not only because it jerked around quite a bit, but that it wasn't even ""sized"" for television viewing. I am wondering if any of the other titles I bought, ""Kind Hearts and Coronets"" and ""The Ladykillers"" will be any better."
5,Classic Understated Ealing Comedy,"THE LAVENDER HILL MOB is an extremely short film - only 71 minutes long - but within that time it is a masterpiece of economy. A classic crime caper involving a bank robbery, model Eiffel Towers, a trip to France and the (expected) unraveling of the plot (due to censorship restrictions), it is most fondly remembered for its performances. Alec Guinness is masterful as the apparently mouse-like bamk clerk Holland, with his silver-rimmed spectacles and hunched shoulders; complemented by Stanley Holloway as Pendlebury, a timid in character as he is imposing in screen presence. Charles Crichton's direction in a gray, bomb-damaged post-war London is masterful; the film is a wonderful piece of social history."
5,LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?,"If you are looking for a challenge on your treadmill, this is the excercise program for you. I read one of it's reviews before I purchased it. I thought that the individual who worte the review was exaggerating. To my suprise, she wasn't! This workout (...)...in a good way though! I love it. You work all parts of the body, and towards the end, they even have you do some push-ups, crunches and finish up with stretching."
4,Good Ideas for Varying Your Treadmill Workouts,"Good video, but I had to adapt it to my level, because it starts out pretty fast. Even beginners can do the video if you're willing to keep your treadmill slower than the video goes until you get the hang of the exercises. The video includes some exercises with weights, various stepping and skipping, various up and down moves with the incline on your treadmill and short slow jog sprints."
4,"It takes the ""Humdrum"" out of using your treadmill.","Extremely challenging. While using my treadmill, I'd tend to become bored within twenty minutes or so into the workout, not with this video. This video is interesting, motivating and intense. Some of the moves require time to become familiar with but that's the interesting phase of it. The video takes the beginner, intermediate and advanced users abilities into consideration. Try it out, and if you don't care for it, what's the worst case scenario. Selling it to someone else to sample?"
5,I Know Funny!,"As a cousin of the late, great Henny Youngman, I know funny...And this, my bubbala, is it!"
3,"Excellent, but only in spots.","Overall, I was disappointed with this book. The book was too short, and even then seemed to have been padded. About 1/3 of the sayings were great, but the others should have been replaced by much better ones."
4,A worthwhile read if you want a basic overview,"This book is worth reading if what you are looking for is a basic overview of some basic homesteading concepts. It's great for working out a ""big picture"" plan but comes very short on details.The exception to the above comment is the chapter on alternative water systems, which is rather in depth. But, of course, you will still need to do quite a bit of extra research before implementing any of the ideas therein.The author presents some good ideas and concepts in an easy to read format, the illustrations are comical and fun, and the chapter titled ""Elaine's Chapter"" is a priceless gem of whimsical, down to earth, practicality.All in all, a book worthy of receiving a 4 star rating."
5,Perfect Spinnerbait box,"This is the perfect box for my spinnerbaits that fits in the bottom of my main tackle box. My main tackle box is the split top type with three bait shelves on one side and four shelves on the other. I can easily set the Flambeau Spinnerbait box in the bottom and turn it so it's up against one end of my tackle box. This leaves me with a little over two-thirds of the rest of the bottom to put my soft plastics, smaller containers, etc. Just what I was looking for but could not find at the local stores."
5,so far working really great,"I recently purchased this in hopes of being ""regular"".I take this along with Probiotic eleven.I have tried a lot of different products and they either do not work, work for a while and then stop, or they give me stomach aches and the runs.Taking this with the probiotic eleven (I might not even need the probiotic anymore) has been great so far.I go to the bathroom 6-7 days of the week now, sometimes I have gone more than once a day. You don't get the feeling like you have to go to the bathroom or you will shit yourself either like some other products. It is easy on the stomach. It doesn't make you want to use the bathroom all day long either.I find myself not having to really strain to get it out either. It comes easily to me now. I go usually once a day and have a nice BM. Sorry if I am blunt, but I am being totally serious and trying to be helpful.I love this and recommend it for people who have trouble going to the bathroom everyday, constipation, etc."
5,Frank Sinatra,This was bought as a gift and was found to be very enjoyable. Highly recommeded for anyone who likes Frank Sinatra.
5,Sinatra's Best Swinginest Ever!!,"If not only because it's classic vintage Sinatra at his best, consider the brilliant orchestra arranged and conducted by Nelson Riddle. Recorded with the Riddle orchestra because Billy May was in Florida, Billy asked Nelson to make it sound like Billy May. When Billy heard the master tapes he said,""man, that sounds more like Billy May than Billy May"". A tribute to two of the 20th century's greatest is this swinginest album ever by Frank and Nelson. No other team produced more listenable and classic works then or now! Even my original LP still gives me chills when I listen some 45 years after it's inception!"
5,favorite Sinatra album,"This was the album that got me hooked on Sinatra 25 years ago when I was in my early teens. Maybe it was the cover showing a very hip Sinatra about to travel with a pretty girl to an exotic location. Maybe it was the absolutely perfect choice of songs (with the possible exception of ""Blue Hawaii"" which doesn't do it for me.) How many songs allow you to travel the camel route to Iraq or savor Autumn in New York? They truly don't write tunes like this anymore. Maybe it was the sparkling and witty arrangements by Billy May who proved on this album he could write strings as well as uptempo pieces.Whatever it was, I have listened to this album hundreds of times and never gotten tired of it. You won't either. With its mixture of swingers and ballads, this is the perfect album to get someone listening to Frank."
3,Frank Sinatra vinyl,"It came a little bent because of the way it was packaged, but since I'm not a collector it didn't bother me too much. If it had been done a little differently it wouldn't have been a problem. I'd say this product would be for a Sinatra fan but not a collector as it is a 2009 edition."
2,poor choices,"Of all Sinatra's 14 albums for Capitol this is the worst- or, least best. The album art is a shocker,and Sinatra's choice of material and arranger lacks his usual judgment. He did few themed albums- the choice of material is limiting, and dogs like ""Autumn in New York, ""Isle of Capri"" and ""Blue Hawaii"" are only there to fulfil the travel motif.I don't believe he ever sang those three again. His version of ""Moonlight in Vermont"" is bettered by his live Melbourne concert, and the ""Great songs from Great Britain"" has a superior ""London By Night"" Kipling's lovely poem ""Mandalay"" is butchered by Sinatra. It can be sung in mess halls by drunken soldiers, but not by cool hipsters who use slang like ""cats"" and ""broads"" for men and women. Sinatra is in great voice- I believe he never sang better than in the late fifties- but even the tempi are all over the place here. Sinatra's and May's nadir."
3,Fine work,I never really cared for most of the selections on this album but Come Fly With Me is so good it saves the day.Buy if you have extra money.
4,Frank Flys Sky High,"With his 1957 Come Fly With Me recording, Sinatra continued his theme based album concept - all the songs on this date are about travel. The arrangements and lyrics capture perfectly the mood of the country in 1957, somewhat sleepy, comfortable, dreaming of getting away, the concern for the massive problems of race relationships about to erupt remaining tucked away in our collective subconscious. And that's probably the point with Sinatra; he had that elegance that could make you forget about whatever travail bothered you or was about to bother you. Even the album cover- a perfect rendition of a TWA turbo prop Constellation- harkens you back to an era when it was simpler, if not altogether safer to cast your fate to the wind and get on a plane and go somewhere. But just when you thought it was safe to snooze through this collection, Sinatra almost screams ""Hey, pack up, let's fly away."" OK Frank. Take me where thou wilst."
4,Good&Laid-Back,I really enjoyed this set.very Laid-Back&happening.Now I do Prefer Other Albums a Bit More but this Set has cool Arangements&Frank Sinatra is very cool here.I got alot of His Albums&The Man could Really Phrase.He was something else.
3,Fairy Tales,"I do like this book but I really didn't think they needed a third edition, when the second one is perfectly fine.This is the book to get for these classic wonderful fairy tales that we all have grown up with.There the few stories that many people know all over the world and something that we all can enjoy, no matter how old we get."
5,Stories For Children?,This is a very interesting collection of fairy tales. It has the popular forms and ones that I've never even herd about.I found the omitted tales thrilling and very disturbing. It amuses me how scholars and historians say that fairy tales are damaging to children.When modern day writting is much more sever.
3,Shortened Versions,"ok so im still proud to have the brothers grim collection, but i went to read Rapunzel which was my faveorite growing up and it was barely 3 pages long. I expected it to be a little different for such a cheap price for all the stories, but it just kept skipping the plot with Eventualy, however, but... and it just wasnt as magical. I think i'll still be able to enjoy most of the stories since i havent read most of them before, but.... i'm disapointed"
5,:>,"These are actually quite hillarious! So many are quite random and seem to make no sense, and will provide hours of laughter for all you bored people out there.Forget Disney--these are uncensored and not apologizing to anyone. And little kids will get used to them. It's not an especial problem to all you new-age ""don't scare the children!"" types. Besides...you can talk about them with the kids afterwards;)Ah, German fairytales:>"
5,Gift,"This was a gift for my daughter. I had bought it for her when she was a little girl, but it was ruined by water. She was absolutely thrilled that I found one with the same cover picture."
5,"Amazing, enchanting, scary, fun, violent, gruesome, etc.","I am presently having a ball going through these fairy tales which were collected by the brothers Grimm over a century ago. These 200 tales are enchanting, scary, lovely, fantastic, grisly, etc. Some of these tales are definitiely NOT for bedtime reading for youngsters. They will frighten children. That makes them great reading for adults! There is nothing else like these fairy tales in print. Buy these books and read a few each day. They are thoroughly entertaining."
4,Wonderful way to explore classical fairy tale literature,"As a child, I remember reading these fairy tales all the time. Now as an adult I am able to read them the way they were written. I do not recommend these tales for small children, as some are quite graphic and can be disturbing, but for an older audience or teenager this is a great way to get back in touch with your childhood and explore how these tales were meant to be read"
1,"Horrid book, with way too much fasle information....","This is one of the most horrid books I have ever read. There isn't any factual science based conclusions in the book at all. If parasites were responsible for all forms of cancer, then why would only this author come to this conclusion? It's a hoax even to homeopathic remedies, and I enjoy using natural methods for everything. I'm glad I only borrowed this book and didn't buy it. If I could I would have given this 0 stars, but 1 is the lowest. If you also notice 90% of the reviews on here are BEFORE 2007, which is odd because the book was published in 2007? Did someone rig the reviews here? That would be my guess after reading them. And as another reviewer stated, I took a further look into the author and realized that criminal actions were taken for previous ""scams""/hoaxes by this author. I wouldn't waste your time even borrowing this book. :("
1,If it sounds like a duck ...,"Yet another nonsensical tome by ""Dr."" Hulda R. Clark (She is NOT a medical doctor. She has a Ph.D. degree in physiology from the University of Minnesota, and a naturopathic (N.D.) degree from Clayton College of Natural Health, a correspondence school.)Briefly, she claims that cancer, AIDS, and well, just about every disease there is, is cause by parasites that can be eradicated with a low-voltage device known as a ""Zapper.""I am a ardent believer in alternative and complementary medicine, but in my own humble opinion, ""Dr."" Clark's theories are pure quackery.Before wasting your time or money on this or any other books by ""Dr."" Clark, I would suggest you visit http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/Cancer/clark.html and read Dr. Stephen Barrett, M.D.'s detailed and insightful article titled, ""The Bizarre Claims of Hulda Clark."""
5,I like this movie,This movie was the best brucelee flim I ever watch.Its betterthen the other lee films I watch.This movie was a master piece.It is a action packed movie. If you want a good movie withaction you want this film.
5,"Aight, no doubt one of Lee's Greatest!","Bruce Lee was The Dragon, Bruce Lee was the greatest martial artist ever! His technique better than every GREAT martial artist there is: Jet Li, Jackie Chan, Billy Han, and Tommy Lee. Notice I didn't say Chuck Norris or Steve Blackman, since they are posers. Not only is Bruce Lee quick, well, he's awesome. His kicks were faster than what the camera's framerate could handle, and his punches were a blur on screen. This DVD not only gets the video quality a little better, but has very good extra features that the VHS versions don't have. Watch out for Jackie Chan and Sammo in the movie!"
4,Enter the Dragon - One of Bruce Lee's best,"Bruce Lee's first and only American film, ENTER THE DRAGON is amazing. It has a good plot, and good dialogue and actors, but it's Bruce Lee that makes this picture so enjoyable. His incredible martial arts techniques will blow you away! Second only to RETURN OF THE DRAGON, this is a must-own for any serious Martial-Arts film fan."
2,Too over-rated for what a clearly poor movie,"I didn't say that I dislike Bruce Lee, but I found that this movie lacks his charisma and aura. When I first watch this video I expect a lot of action, but the most exciting fight scenes only come 50 minutes later. Before that we just see Bruce walking, smiling, have a flashback and the introduction of other unneeded heroes.Having two other characters (John Saxon and Jim Kelly) playing good guys had reduced many spaces for Bruce himself. Without those two we can see more of Bruce kicking, fighting and flying.To name 'Enter the Dragon' as the best martial arts movie is too misleading. For those who like to watch real and pure martial arts I recommend other Bruce Lee films (The Chinese Connection and The Way of the Dragon) or Jackie Chan films (Wheels On Meals or Dragons Forever)."
2,Only one good scene,"Thanks to this ... were ""The Game Of Death"" never finished by Bruce. The only scene worth to watch in this one is Bruce's incredibly fast backhand when he competes with Bob Wall. Otherwise its a bad martil arts movie and doesnt even compare with ""Way Of The Dragon"", Bruce Lee's best."
4,Enter the Dragon,"I dont like when the bars are covering the movie and I can not see the whole screen, but the movie was awsome."
5,Betta Bruce,"What can I say when it comes to Bruce Lee! Any chance to see him more clearly should be taken and HD does it nicely; I could catch blemished on is skin and all those somewhat blurred close ups come to life. Still can't quite catch the path of his blows on slow mo, but somehow HD really makes a difference."
5,The entire video was great!,"This video is great to own in that there is a bonus disc which focuses on the life and career of the starring actor, Bruce Lee.The bonus disc has a special feature which documents his life as well as his son Brandon's. Both are now dead (Brandon died in 1993 - just 59 days after his 28th birthday - whilst working on ""The Crow"" and the resulting said film was released the next year as a tribute)."
3,Kung Fu King,"I bought this DVD to show my Grandson (age 7) the best martial atrist to ever live. Bruce Lee is the one everyone else copied and wanted to be like. He is so fast and powerful the human eye cannot see his moves and Bruce was a perfectionist and did more for the martial arts than anyone in history. Most ""karate"" films were cheesy and unbelievable (flying in the air and whipping twenty guys at once as they take turns attacking of course) Enter the Dragon actually tries to have a storyline and attempted to legitimize these kinds of flims. It is very dated and when watched after all these years you see all the ugly holes in it from awful acting to foolish looking fighting BUT I recommend fast forwarding to watch Bruce do his thing and you will see why he was and still is the Best!"
4,It's Bruce Lee. 'Nuff said.,"What can I say about this movie that's not already been said? It's a great one, with Bruce Lee at his finest. Great cast, great production. Blu-Ray brings the movie home like you've never see it before, and the extras that come with it are marvelous. Highly recommended to any Bruce Lee or martial arts movie fan."
5,Best of the Best,"Enter the Dragon was purchased because I have been a huge Bruce Lee fan since age 16, when he blew me away in 1973, ironically, I came to love and admire him only months before his death in July of 1973. I can recite most of the lines from the movie by memory, having seen it from start to finish 100s and 100s of times, I've lost count. Never in my wildest imagination would I think that one day I would be able to own my very own copy of this fantastic, action packed feature of the ""Little Dragon""..Bruce Lee in Enter the Dragon. I also purchased the soundtrack from the movie, and had numerous posters of my kung-fu hero. Anyone who compares Bruce Lee with today's action-stars e.g. Jackie Chan, Jet Li etc, is comparing apples to oranges..not even close. Although I do so admire these stars, they just aren't comparable to Bruce Lee, He stands alone, and always will. I will never get tired of watching Enter the Dragon to this day now at age 50+, best of the best."
5,Where is the theatrical version???,"In general, I like movies that are extended edition, unfortunately I like Enter the Dragon better in it's theatrical edition. Most movies that were released multiple times normally included extended and theatrical versions but not in the case of ETD. ETD Blu Ray was first released on 17 April 2007 and then again on 15 Jul 2010 but no theatrical edition either."
4,Great film is so old now its scary,"God, this fine martial arts film was made all the way back in 1973--the american civil rights movement had just ended and everything was big hair and polyester clothes the world over! That's the world this movie is set in (had it just been made a few years later--like 3-- it would be so much less datable). Perhaps Lee's death was itself the true end of an era (at least in Asia)! The film is a fine action packed spy thriller with Lee reruited by the government to go after the very bad man named Han--a man who happens to also be responsible for Lee's sister's death--how's that for coincidences? John Saxon is a great supporting cast member playing Roper, a man who crosses Han's path on his own time!"
5,The Best Martial Arts Movie of All Time,"This movie is my favorite of all time, and we will never see another person come close to Bruce Lee... ever."
2,favorite movie -> terrible master,"I was really looking forward to Enter the Dragon on Blu-Ray. I had the vhs, laser disc, dvd, and now blu-ray. Unfortunately Warner really jumped the gun. the video has hair balls, specks and missing frames. Sure it's sharp but why couldn't they get the film out of a cleaner can. I'm really disappointed."
2,Played poorly,"I don't know if this disc was not prepared correctly or what, but it did not play well for me."
3,"OVERRATED, but a great movie !","The artmartial sequences are amazing, Bruce is getting better and better as an actor. THis clearly showed how he was improving and what he would accomplish if Death hadn't come to his way.But technically is still an inferior movie, a kind of ""B-class"" movie, and only die-hard fans don't see it. As the plot, I prefer his older movies, like ""THE BIG BOSS""."
2,Not ALL THAT,"Sure this movie is a classic but lets face it. Its the bad acting that kills it and the lack of real substance to the story line. If this movie came out today people would hate it. The Karate Kid out does this movie and what does that tell you. Luckily, Bolo Yeung and The crazy old man with the bear claw find work later on in a real good movie Bloodsport."
4,ULTIMATE KUNG FU CLASSIC,"ENTER THE DRAGON Two-Disc Special Edition (Warner) is not only the best Bruce Lee movie but the best Kung Fu film (sorry, Quentin). It's been 30 years since Lee's untimely death andfor me, he's still the ultimate martial arts action guy in the movies.This double disc has several compelling documentaries that examine Lee's life and skills. A special treat is previously unseen footage of Lee in action.Disc Two includes John Little's feature length biography Bruce Lee: A Warrior's Journey with a meticulous reconstruction of Lee's intended cut of The Game of Death."
4,Wow!!!,"I bought this already loving the movie, but hating the ""grainy"" poor quality that comes with being a 60-70's film ,etc. The film looks Awesome in Blu-ray!! If makes the film that much more enjoyable."
4,No copying allowed.,"The definitive Kung-Fu spectacle,the definitive Bruce Lee.Many memorable scenes,including some great fights,and those over-the- top Bruce Lee squeeking and screeching sounds! This DVD presents the film in it's correct ratio-(2.35:1),the picture is superb,considering the films age.Only very slight grain is evident,on rare instances.The sound also is superb,i heard no background noise,hissing,or distortion problems.Some great extras on this DVD also,make this an absolute must for any fan of Bruce Lee/Martial Arts.overall,4.5/5."
4,"Taking its Age into Account, Pretty Good Transfer to Blu-Ray","I was impressed with this transfer to Blu-Ray. Resolution was great, although colors and detail not as vivd (due to reproduction from old film). Still, better than some of the newer BRD releases such as Legend of Sleepy Hollow (stay away from that one)."
2,Good Movie Bad Transfer,"This has the worst HD transfer that I have ever seen. Many of the scenes looked like bad internet video with visible pixelization. Already have the DVD, don't bother with the blu ray."
4,No Game of Death extra on Blu Ray,My blu ray is missing the Game of Death extra. All the other extras are there. A little bummed it's missing that one extra.
5,A classic martial arts action film!,"There is only one reason to watch this: the iconic Bruce Lee at his best in an English-language film. His other previous films were released in Chinese but this was his introduction to the American film industry. Here he takes on the evil and fallen Shaolin Temple trained student now a crime lord. The plot is decent but the action scenes with Bruce lee steal the movie. Sadly, the quality of the film has not been improved much but watching Bruce lee dish out justice with his now-classic noises is pure action fun. Side note: John Saxon fakes most of his moves and still looks like a novice American wanna-be. Mr. Saxon does add some light humor with his role."
5,The quintessential martial arts flick...,"If you consider yourself a martial arts movie fan, then you have to have seen Enter the Dragon. This is the quintessential martial arts movie, hands down, bar none. For starters, the mythology surrounding events that occurred (supposedly) during the making of this movie are outrageous (Bruce Lee getting his hand cut during one of the fight scenes with Bob Wall, extras supposedly challenging him to spar/fight on the set, etc). And, there are so many great one-liners in Enter the Dragon (especially those belonging to actor and martial artist Jim Kelly). But besides that, the fight scenes were way ahead of this movie's time. Props to Jackie Chan, Tony Jaa, Donnie Yen, Sammo Hung, and yes, even Chuck Norris... but Bruce Lee was and still is the king of the Hong Kong martial arts action movie genre, and this is his crowning achievement."
5,Wataaaaaaahhhhhhhh!!!!!!,This movie remains one of my favorites. The movie follows Bruce Lee to an island fortress where he has been sent to participate in a shady martial arts tournament and take down a druglord. The movie is excellent for being as old as it is. Lee delivers an awesome performance in his last feature film. I would recommend this film to any action or martial arts enthusiast.
3,Not a bad film...,"This is by far, Lee's best movie, not because the fighting scenes are the best (they aren't; in fact, this is one of my least favorite Lee films, in terms of the martial art action) but because, -as opposed to all of his other films- the plot and acting and actors are actually...pretty good. The story is interesting as well. Still, not enough action and a little overrated. Lee's most awesome fight scenes are his action scenes in Return of the Dragon and Chinese Connection. (Though, the LATTER film sucked royally, in every OTHER respect)."
3,Average Conversion,Enter the Dragon is one of the classic Bruce Lee films. Having been filmed way before high definition was invented clearly comes out in the lack of sharpness and vividness of the colors. Newer movies filmed in HD come out much better such as Planet Earth from BBC. Overall average in terms of HD. Movie itself I would rate a 5.
1,no instructions?,"It appears to be a VERY simple device. Plug in your devices to the appropriate places, then push the button for which device you want to use. However, it doesn't work!!!!!! And there's no power switch, so...???"
5,i just cant belive how people can question this man,"If any one is after the real deal, here is a book for you! People out there (the critics) giving this book a bad rap and saying how Pauls techniques is so basic and bla bla bla, first you have no clue and dont understand how important inforamtion like this is when there is no rules and how rare it comes around, Im giving this book 5 stars and a must in any ones collection, it will wake you up to reality and send you down the right path. good work Sifu Vunak(bbj is not the answer --- there is a good section for you guys its called KINO MUTAI wake up and smell the coffee)"
2,"Smart guy, Mediocre book",I got my money's worth with the tidbits. I have absolutely no doubt in my mind that Mr. Vunak knows his stuff. Somehow the book's a miss. Good state-of-mind stuff. Only place I've read about chewing on your opponent. Didn't care for the techniques offered.
2,Cheap Little Chopper,"This little chopper, ""Nutone,"" now made by a third party, is not worth buying. We had the older Nutone in-counter power unit and food processor, which worked well. This chopper almost tore itself to bits when we first tried to use it: its assembly is fussy and its parts are not robust. Its capacity is too small as well, it will not even handle a whole onion. It does not perform any other food processing, like shredding cheese or slicing vegetables."
3,Solid supplements,"3 1/2This would probably be the one to purchase after getting his three excellent official releases, as it contains some inferior or alternate material so as to be a collection of b-sides of sorts. But Drake's skills as a singer/songwriter/guitarist, even in simplest form, are still a wondrous talent to behold, and TONR contains enough acoustic grandeur to stand aside his masterworks."
4,As good as the other albums,"I've recently discovered Nick Drake and when I bought his first album, Five Leaves Left, I never thought I would buy this posthumous release made of all the studio outtakes available from his brief recording career, plus a few home recordings. But after having bought the three ""regular"" albums, well, I just had to have this one too because his music is so great, both depressing and healing. And this album is as good as the three others. Most of the songs are acoustic ; ""I was made to love magic"", the only one who actually was arranged with an orchestral backing, is wonderful. Listen to it. Listen to Nick Drake's music."
2,"Received 4 perms, no packing and busted box of Perm",I like the product and have been using it for years. I've ordered off the internet a few times before and the boxes of perms were always packed well enough to not get broken open in shipment. This company put about 8 packing peanuts in the bottom of a box of 4 perms and one perm box was smashed. The perm solutions were all over the other boxes and ruined salvaging anything from the broken box. The cost is not worth returning and the time and effort in contacting the vendor and complaining.
5,Spectacular,"I purchased two copies of this book. The photographs are strong and captivating, followed by awe inspiring stories from a variety of backgrounds. It is a perfect gift for any woman in your life."
1,"Great Animation, poor transfer","The animations on this disk can be had on the ""super jewelcase"" version of this disk. The video transfer on this particular disk is awful. Buy the DVD with the guy in the red spiral on the cover, the animations are the same, but the video transfer is far superior."
5,Great Animation!,"Many of these animation shorts are among the best from the past 25 years. The video transfer is very good, but they all have an aspect ratio of 1.33:1. Worth getting just for The Cat Came Back."
3,"entertaining, but...","While this has some classics (The Big Snit, The Cat Came Back, etc), and is one of the best collections of Canadian animation, it's also a re-packaging of existing collection under a different title, leading me to buy a collection i already had."
1,the worst club record in rap history!,"Geez what can I say about this record. awkward sounding beat, vomit inducing lyrics and the most retarded hook you'll ever hear. To make matters worse there is even a female response to this assbackward track(why? somebody please tell me why?) called chic-o stik. These fools cant rap, their beats sound like cheap background music for Atari games and their beef with Dem franchize punks is the lamest rap beef in rap history(yes even lamer than Nelly vs Chingy)! How their wack album went gold is proof that insanity is a reality. F*** Dookie4Life!"
1,Leon Redbone - On the Track,"The only song I like on this cd is ""Saving My Love For You"". It's a classic."
5,learn to sign,I have a daycare and we watch this video several times a week. The kids love this video. Even the one year olds watch it with great interest. The kids have already learned so many signes. Very well done.
3,Not as good as Vol 1 & 2,"I absolutely loved Vol 1 and 2 and my 3 year old and 1 year old ADORE these dvd's. When I viewed Vol 3, I was disappointed that the music was different and not as catchy. And it did not hold my children's interest as well as the first two. I thought this one was too slow and I am sad that the creators messed with a good thing."
4,Fast service,I received this dvd very fast! It was in great shape! This signing time is a little outdated. Not as fun as some of the others.
2,"ok, but there are better","I decided with all of the good reviews I would try this series, and I have to say, it's pretty disappointing compared to others we've bought! The ""Baby Signs"" series is much better at getting and keeping my 2 1/2 year olds attention, it's just all around more fun... so are the Baby Einsteins DVD's. I would only buy these for kids over 5."
3,comment of the item,"Actually,volume 3 it's okay,since i'd been using dvd for sign language,our class been learning lots of words already and i purchase another volume 1 so its getting backward,however the 2 dvd that i purchase still usable for my son 2 years old."
2,little fast for learning,It is an entertaining DVD but is a little fast paced making it hard to follow. I would not have purchase the product if I had viewed it prior to purchase.
3,Okay DVDs,"They were okay DVDs, good for kids and even adults to watch. I bought them for 2 6-year olds and they liked them well enough, but were not overly impressed. However, I think they are a little too pricey for what you receive. I think $9.99 should be the maximum price for these at today's rates."
5,Totally recommend,"Love it, love it, love it! The 'Signing Time' series is wonderful. Fun music, songs and sceens. Our son is 19 months old and has been signing basic signs since about 12 months. We first bought Baby See 'n Sign (don't waste the money) and he wouldn't even pay attention to them. I couldn't even stand watching them, extremely boring and a lot of the signs are not correct ASL. Then we went to 'Baby Signs'...excellent, great for beginners, easy for babys to relate to Bebo the bear and the characters, however not enough signs on each video otherwise I would have kept buying them. I decided to try the 'Signing Time' series and he really enjoys watching them. He even does the sign and says the word with Leah & Alex. He will watch a whole video. I really like the review section for my husband and I because we don't always get to watch the entire video (cooking dinner etc). I plan on buying the rest of the videos."
3,Something to think about,"I was surprised to find the negative review on this DVD. They brought it back because it signed ""Candy"", ""Cookie"", and ""Ice Cream""!I just want to say this. I have a child with autism. These DVD's have greatly helped her to communicate with us. Having signs that are motivating for her to use is important. If a child can ask for a ""Cookie"" that is very powerful for a 2.5 yr old.In the beginning, I don't think I could have gotten my child to sign ""Liver""... ""More Liver Please Mom."" or ""Lima Beans"". You get the picture. Children learn when it's motivating to them. I'm not trying to put the other reviewer down. I just felt the need to address an important subject. I am suprised that she didn't see the 'value' from her child's eyes. They could have learned a whole new language."
5,My dd made up a sign to ask for this!,"My husband and I are not big on letting our daughter watch TV, but we checked these out from the library. She is 14 months old and loves them to death. I like them because they are live action, not annoying, and great for learning. She has picked up several signs from the videos, and the other day came in and pointed to the TV while shaking her hands up and down! Honestly, some of the songs are not that great, but the video of other kids doing signs is priceless, and they make it really easy for everyone, even parents, to learn signs. If you want to learn some basic ASL, I highly recommend all the videos in this series!"
1,New depths,"Before I heard this album I was convinced that MacGowan's minor(!) drinking problem never would damage his music, considering his earlier accomplishments. This proves me wrong. From start to finish this is the kind of garbage I'm embarrased to own."
3,STU MEAT SAYS,"good cd. shane macgowan after the pogues. not as good as the snake but still really good. first 4 songs and song 15 are absolute best, and then everything else decent."
2,Rather corny,"The decline continues. Generic tunes and trite, self-conscious Bad Boy lyrics. Silly and more than a little pathetic. Shane MacGowan was a real talent, but it would take a superman to survive both his self-abuse and an uncritical audience that'll evidently eat up anything he puts out as long as he lays on the usual cornball mush-mouthed blarney. People can talk great Irish poets, but right now Shane is neither bard nor seer. He's just a sickly has-been coasting for fans -- aging, gullible and belligerent -- who greet tales of the I.R.A. the way teenage metal heads greet evocations of Satan.More than a little embarassing."
4,GOOD READ FOR CRIME BUFFS,THE BOOK GIVES A GOOD INSIGHT TO THE HISTORY OF THE LAPD.....IT LETS YOU INTO CRIMES THAT HAVE HAUNTED THE AREA FOR YEARS AND GIVES YOU AN APPRECIATION TO THOSE WHO HAVE TO WEAR THE ACTUAL BADGE.
4,Dated but that made it all the more interesting,"Definitely a dated book. But from Jack Webb's writing you can tell he was an accomplished person. The book is riddled with crime stories as it explains the varies levels of the 1950s Los Angeles Police Department. It's not quite like his docudrama Dagnet series, yet I almost heard his voice as I read. The story of the Black Dahlia was by far the most interesting and I can see how introduction writer James Ellroy became fascinated with the case after reading about it in this book. I found myself looking up documentaries that covered the never-solved Black Dahlia case. (Found one by James Ellroy as a matter of fact that offered a plausible answer to whodunit).If jack Webb were alive today, I would truly love to meet him to discuss this book."
4,Sit Back And Enjoy,"Very satisfied with my purchase. Finally something not made in China. A true American Icon. Only drawback, all episodes were from the 1930's. Would have liked to see episodes from the 1940's and 50's."
3,Hopalong Cassidy A True American Icon,"Buenas transparencia de las primeras peliculas. Aunque paresca raro me gustaria que algun dia colorizaran algunas. La recomindo , buena calidad de imagen y sonido."
1,Deceving title,"While the exercises in this box might be good exercises, the title is deceiving. Even some of the basic beginner pilates exercises (The Hundred, etc.) are not given in this set. If you want to learn Pilates this is not the item to do it with. If you want a set of exercise cards to use, this might be a fine product."
1,Disappointing,"While I thought this was a great idea when I bought it, it has failed to live up to expectations. The 'how to use' instructions are inadequate and it lacks clear and logical organisation. I have been doing pilates for a while, so I am not a beginner, but I found this absolutely impossible to use and very frustrating. Big disappointment."
5,Awesome Study Book,"Ive just recieved this book from a friend,and it is simply filled with the wonderful names of Jehovah.If you want to know Him,you just have to get this book.It is just awesome!!!Thank you for letting me share my knowledge of this book."
2,and a half,"As someone who LOVES to draw but is BAD at it,I bought this(or perhaps one of the versions of it)desperate for such a book..one that teaches you to draw.This is really for kids though,with few pages and a very quick,amateur lesson in how to draw.By all means buy it for kids,it isnt bad.But for older people looking to learn to draw,this isn't the one!!However, adults could still buy it if they cannot find any other.I dont want to give people the wrong idea that this is a dweeby book because its not.It IS good for the ages it is aimed at."
5,Classic,"This is truly a classic within the so called Industrial genre.""Further"" combines hasrh power-like noise strucute, with dark ambient drones and ambience, and for even more depth throws in minimal, yet deep meanings lyrics. An amazin release from this San Fran based band, a cd to dream to, to read to, to..do whatever you want. If you like this cd, check out Gridlock's side porject, Dryft.."
2,A disappointment,"What more can I say. These hymns are such a part of my history that when I heard this CD, I was sorely disappointed. Too much tinkering. Amy Grant has such talent, it's too bad she blew it with what could have been a slam dunk with a more straightforward treatment."
2,not as good as legacy,"it's ok if you love country mucis mixed with hymns.it's the continuation of legacy but it's definately not as good as legacy.It's ok i guess, nothing ""WOW"" about it though."
2,Creative....Not,"I would have to agree with ""Okie"" that Amy's stuff is not nearly as good as it used to be. In fact, her creativity has gone downhill dramaticall in the last 7-8 years. When she was married to Gary Chapman, I know the relationship was rocky, but he was the flint that sharpened her musical steel. Now, she has become a little vince clone."
4,Hymns With a Modern Touch,"This is an enjoyable CD which takes some old hymns and gives them a modern touch. For the most part, the update is a country sound.Amy Grant has a voice that is superb. She gave a very good performance on several of these songs. In particular, I like her versions of 'Rock of Ages', and 'Abide With Me'. She has a great sounding version of 'El Shaddai' on here, but of course this is not the only CD of hers where one could find that.For those who enjoy a modern twist on old hymns, this is a worthwhile collection. I would also recommend the recent CDs by 'Passion' and 'Jars of Clay' which have also done that."
4,Soothing sweet sound,"I purchased this CD for my husband but Amy Grant's voice is soft and at a level he has trouble hearing, so I put it in my car player and enjoy it thoroughly while driving. It is a soothing, sweet sound to listen to while driving."
3,Amy Grant Rock of Ages,It's okay; just not as good as previous one. Wish there were more with Vince Gill.
3,Grammy Award for this Album....,"Although this is NOT my favorite Amy Grant album BY FAR...I have to respond to 'Christian Mom's' review....which I think was way out of line and quite misleading. Just to note, 'Rock of Ages....Hymns and Faith' just won the Grammy Award for Best Gospel (Southern, Country) Album this year...so, obviously it can't be that bad....this record doesn't appeal to me musically, but many (including the Grammy committee) seem to really like it and see the talent and soul pt into this."
2,"Too Much Vince, Not Enough Amy","Amy Grant's albums used to be ground-breaking, fresh and innovative. Not any more. She has lost her identity to Vince Gill. How sad. What more can I say?"
2,I really do miss the old Amy,"I did buy this CD hoping it would be similar to Legacy. . .where there were a few country-fied songs.However, this CD is full of them - right from the get go. I am not a real strong fan of country music. I was a fan of the music Amy did several years ago.So, I figure after a week of listening to this CD, I might get used to it. But why should I have to get used to it?"
2,I Miss the Salt and Light Human Amy,"Lead Me On, Heart in Motion, House of Love. These songs spoke to imperfect humans, trying to achieve something greater. This and Legacy panders back to her preaching to the choir days."
2,Not Good Enough,"Amy lost much of her Xtian fan base when she defected from Gary Chapman to Vince Gill. This album is not going to help her regain what she lost, because it sounds too much like Mr.Gill. Granted, he is a pretty good instrumentalist and a tolerable singer, but not a good producer; not even the great Brown Bannister could rescue this album from the Gill influence. Coupled with the dismal sales of her previous 2 albums, this one does not bode well for Amy's musical future."
5,A great way to start or end the day!,This is simply wonderful gospel; comfort food like gingerbread cookies or homemade macaroni and cheese. Listen to track 2; this one alone is worth the buy...
5,"Amy has done it again with ""Rock of Ages!""","The leading lady of Christian music has done it again! And what a gem, just a beautiful album over all. In these times of life when we need a reminder that we are loved by Him these songs bring us peace and remind us of just that, they have since the early 1800's. I love the feel of this album you can't label it as just having one particular type of sound, because in the 13 tracks there is something for everyone. Regardless of if you have heard these hymns or not they will move you, and be great inspiration. At age 21 I had never heard a few, and so what a blessing it is to be introduced to them by Amy, just like I had on ""Legacy"". Thank you Amy, for reminding us the music began so many years ago in the words of these hymns."
4,Solar stone destinations,Fantastic trance album. Dance music has been a bit tedious of late but this double cd album has been a breath of fresh air. Particularly like the final track by Solar Stone. Keep replaying it all the time. Good for those serious chill-out moments.
2,No. Not so good.,"This cd did not impress me, and thats sad cause I'm a HUGE fan of the trance genre. Lame, repeative, and songs I've heard before in various cd's before this one (there not even decent remixes)."
4,Fine Companion to Unhalfbricking,"Joe Boyd's sleevenotes explain how most of these excellent songs never made it onto albums at the time: he was keen for Fairport to explore their Englishness, and so they did on ""Leige and Lief"" and subsequent albums. But before developing as pioneers of British folk-rock, Fairport showed an uncanny knack for infusing their own individual style into songs by the likes of Joni Mitchell and Leonard Cohen - and of course Bob Dylan. Throw in some Everly Brothers, Johnny Cash and Gene Clark, along with a couple of Fairport originals, and you have some wonderful songwriting talent here. Add to this the lovely singing of Sandy Denny and Ian Matthews, both great individually but together, sublime - and you have a brilliant album which bears comparison to ""Unhalfbicking"" and ""What We Did on Our Holidays"". Highly recommended."
3,For fans of Fairport's singer-songwriter period,"This is a pleasant but non-essential souvenir of Fairport Convention's early days, when a large part of their repertoire was covers of American singer-songwriter material. The recordings were made for BBC radio broadcasts. Ten of the twelve songs are cover tunes, of which two (Dylan's ""Percy's Song"" and Joni Mitchell's ""I Don't Know Where I Stand"") have previously appeared on Fairport albums. There's some Leonard Cohen, some Everly Brothers, a little Byrds... A highlight is ""Some Sweet Day"". Of all the Fairport albums, this one has the least connection to the band's later folk-rock sound.(1=poor 2=mediocre 3=pretty good 4=very good 5=phenomenal)"
3,"They're trying to be ""hip"" and global, but don't ""cut it""","I can't really put into words why, but this CD to me comes off as a bit ""goofy"", like a group who's trying to do all that pan-world stuff that's so in now, and they try to do it with a somewhat experimental edge, but it just doesn't work. In a somwhat similar vein of music, I find Conspiracy Theory's Thievery Corporation (or is it vice versa) CD to be much more ""cool""."
2,Lesser effort from TU,"If you heard Transglobal Underground somewhere, or heard OF them, and want to try out their music to see if you like it, my advice to you is this: rush out and get ""Psychic Karaoke."" Then get ""International Times."" Both are exciting, exotic, multifaceted and over all thrilling albums that will make you dance, trance, whatever. Two examples of the TU folks at their best.""Rejoice, Rejoice"" is not such an album. The other reviews here pretty much sum it up: there are a couple of strong tracks, but most of the music is uninspired, sophomoric, even irritating - especially when compared to the towering strength of the aforementioned two releases. You'd have to pry my copies of ""Psychic Karaoke"" and ""International Times"" out of my cold, dead hands before I'll give them up. As for ""Rejoice, Rejoice""? After a few listens, I sold it on eBay."
3,"You've been there: 22 kt gold, frankincense, the henna party","A mix between Euro-disco, rap and calls to prayer. Like chant, at times; is it transgloabal or desecration for commercial ends? It will make you move, but so will alot of other things. Over all, enjoyable, makes you want to break out those old posionous Clove cigarettes and get down."
3,handle edges too sharp,"There is too many sharp edges on this knife.. I was expecting a sharp blade but not a sharp handle... There is no radius on the handle edges. Besides this, it is a good quality knife."
2,Serious issues with knife,"I am surprised this has not been addressed. I purchased this to replace a cheap Husky knife I purchased from Home Depot that kept getting jammed after a few weeks time and would not close. On this knife I had three problems: (1) Whenever you unfolded the knife to use it, you had to watch not to cut yourself on the blade, so you had to open it from a very particular hand position and angle or you could easily cut yourself. (2) The clip atop the blade is loose, it does not 'snap"" in in some fashion so as to secure the blade very well and would often swing open at certain points when usign this (3) When I went to make my first blade change I COULD NOT close the clip no matter how hard I tried. I had to return this item to Amazon. Simply could not use it at that point. I had had it only about 3-4 days.I gave it two stars only because it seemed like it had nice potential - it had good heft, nice polished wood grain handle, otherwise this was a one-star experience to me."
5,Love it!,Love this knife. Already own one but wanted another for back up in case I ever lost it. Cuts great and is easy to refill.
3,"Great knife, but some problems","I got this knife for my husband for Christmas after carefully research. He loved it for the first couple months until the screws that hold the belt clip on the knife fell out. Some of the other screws followed suit. This really is a great knife, bar the whole ""screws coming loose"" thing. He got the Bessey PVC knife for Father's Day and is thinking of gluing the screws in somehow so they stay in."
5,Nice folding utility knife.,"I bought this utility knife thinking that it would open with one hand. Kind of does, if your hands are the size of King Kong. Very tough to open with one hand. And you definitely need two hands to close it. Otherwise, it is very well made and will stand up to years of use. Very easy to swap the blade as well. Great product."
5,best knife i have ever owned!!!!!!,i use this to trim the bark off the canes i build. it works GREAT and it's pretty too boot!!!! very good product!!!!!!:>))))
4,I'd buy it again,"I work in a physical environment and needed a blade I could retract with one hand. I also had to meet the safety requirements on the job site (no pocket knives). The blade changes out easily. I use it for cutting fire blanket, plastic and of course boxes. I gave it four stars because of the weight."
3,Almost Perfect...,"Heavier than most knives of this type, wich to me is a plus.The only thing I don't like is the blade changing system.Lifting the lever sliding the side up is not the easiest or safest method.Other brands (Husky..) use a pin that you push in then simply slide the blade out, and a new one in.That is much better.Other than that I like it. It only holds 1 blade at a time..."
2,"It's solid, and it cuts stuff, but...","...I wouldn't buy it again.Heavy (good and bad), solid feel, woodgrain looks nice, etc. The quick-change mechanism is exactly that, and solid/tight when closed. Those are the good points.There are two main reasons I wouldn't buy this knife again. First, the lockback design. In the age of liner locks (release with your thumb for one-handed closing), it makes no sense to manufacture a knife with the lock release on the back. I never grab this knife because it takes two hands to close it. Second, and this is a MAJOR design flaw, when the knife is closed, you can squeeze the blade assy closed further and the blade edge actually contacts part of the inner frame, nicking the blade. This is a huge oversight and completely unacceptable.But hey...it looks nice sitting in my toolbox."
3,"Solid build, but can cause issues","When I first bought this knife, I was extremely pleased with the solid build quality. There was nothing bad to say about the unit, until I dropped it on concrete one day. Granted, this isn't a manufacturer defect, it's just a problem I caused, but the edge that landed on the concrete became rough and, when wearing the knife on my belt, the rough edge would rub against my pants and start tearing a hole into them. I've since changed to a Bessey knife with a PVC handle. Same great build quality, but none of the rough edges from inevitable abuse."
1,item came used,"The item seem to be used... oily, fingerprints, sticker on blade handle and overall looked dirty. It was a waste of time to return and wait."
1,Broke while cutting up the cardboard amazon box it came in...,"I've owned a TON of utility knives in my search for the ""ONE""...sadly, this wasn't it and I'm dumbfounded by all the positive reviews here on this site. This knife lasted all about 5 minutes and literally broke the first time I used it -- cutting up the Amazon box it came in. The head on the bolt that holds the body of the knife together sheared right off and now it's a wobbly/useless mess. I'm too busy/lazy to fuss with the RMA to send this back, so I'll retire it to my drawer of other misfit utility knives. I can also confirm that this knife is way too heavy to carry in a pocket all day. FYI...my current go-to knife is the Stanley 10-816L matched with a Bucket Boss 54042 knife holder, but still looking..."
5,The best utility knife,"I have been using this knife while finishing my basement. I have it on me at all time during this endeavor. Its uses are many. It feels very rugged and its weight make gripping it and cutting easy. After using cheap unergonomic knives, this one feels great to grip. I highly recommend it."
4,taste like popcorn,"My baby's more than one year old. he don't like its taste, though i hope he can eats them, for i bought 4 cans. maybe it just eats like popcorns and has no other chedder taste."
5,My 9 month loves these!,"I like the veggie dip and the garden tomato flavors best but I think my little one would eat any of them. He loved the puffs and now the crunchies. They are a perfect size for getting him to feed himself but they can get messy. Even when they get stale, he loves them. It's a good snack for him and definitely a little overpriced, but Amazon has them cheaper than any store in my area. And I'm as a first time mom, I'm a sucker for any baby related foods that seem healthier than what my nephews are eating."
3,Great product but I don't like the packaging,I love these and my 8 month old loves them but I don't think the product canister does a good job of keeping them fresh. It seems like they go stale VERY fast. I don't think the baby cares but since I eat them with her it bothers me.
2,too much salt and WAY too much garlic,"First of all, I have major issues with children's snacks that are so full of sodium.I have to admit, my son loves these. What is not so great is the two or three days of garlic breath I have to endure afterwards. Was it so necessary to add garlic salt to a toddler snack?"
1,DO NOT DISSOLVE-CHOKING HAZARD,"Great in theory...healthy, organic, etc. ... however, this product does not dissolve in babies mouth NOR in Mommy's mouth. My child, 7 months old, put one in his mouth, he has two teeth, tried to bite it, it did not break...he then sucked one for about 2 minutes then ... just like a kid...placed another in his mouth. Reminding you, the reader, I was right there when this happened...he began to choke! I lifted him out of his highchair, turned him around, did the Heimlich maneuver on him...he blew one out and then I pulled the first apple wagon out of his mouth. On a lighter note, he's fine, prefers the puffs and whole grain cereal...but the dog couldn't even chew these!!! We do, however, have friends, with a baby girl...same age...and she loves these!!!Happy Baby Gluten-Free Organic Puffs, Sweet Potato Puffs, 2.1-Ounce Containers (Pack of 6)"
1,Too hard to eat!,"Gerber has an amazing line of products for babies and toddlers, but this product is a miss. The Wagon Wheels are extremely hard. They do not dissolve at all in the mouth. I had hoped they would be similar to the puffs Gerber makes (only larger), but they are nothing like them. We had to toss these. I was scared my child would hurt her teeth or choke."
3,Some are too big!,"My son is now 9 months old, he has been eating finger foods for a few months now. We first purchased the Gerber Graduates Mild Cheddar & he loves them! They do just melt in the mouth, perfect because he only had 5 teeth at the time. The only negative I have for these is some of the puffs are fairly large! If I give my son a handful of them, he stuffs them in his mouth, so the larger ones make me nervous. I ususally cut them in half. My new find would be the Target Up & Up brand - they are fairly cheaper & they are all the same size (perfectly smaller) So from now on, I will be saving a few bucks, and using those!"
1,"Great product, but look for a better price elsewhere","My 10-month old loves these! They are helpful to teach him how to eat and relieve pain from teething, too. Look around for a better price: I was able to find a great deal at my local BJ's club: a mixed 6-pack for $9.99. At the supermarket, they are $2/can.Whenever we go out and run errands, I make a snack container for him. I mix a bunch of different snacks together and let him choose what he wants when fussiness ensues. He always chooses these or the Dr. Sears yogurt melts."
2,Too hard and too big,"I bought these for my almost 9 month old twins. I was totally shocked by how hard these wagon wheels were. I bought them thinking they would be like there other products, soft and safe to eat. While I can break them up into little pieces to eat that defeats the purpose I could just give Cheerios for a fraction of the price. I have to say i dont feel comfortable giving them a whole one to eat, they put in there months and they take forever to dissolve. Big miss on Gerbers part for these items."
5,Grandbabies love em,"My grandchildren love these. Their faces just about light up when I pull out one of these cans. I do have to split it up though or they struggle, both want the can and all the wheels."
3,good but strong taste,"My twins are 11 months old and they will eat these, but the taste is somewhat overwhelming like ranch dip. I wouldn't recommend this flavor but I would recommend the product (I thought it would taste more like veggie than dip... my mistake). My 5 year old eats them better than the babies. The whole family likes the taste of the cheese ones, they taste like cheese puffs. I will stick with the cheese next time.Good finger food, but watch your baby if they don't chew well. One of my twins takes too big of bites and has choked on these before (and he has 8 teeth!)"
2,Very hard to chew,"My daughter chews/bites almost everything. But this snack is pretty hard to bite. The size of the wagon wheel is so big that it just goes entirely in her mouth that she can hardly chew. The texture is like that of a hard pita chip. Unless your crawler has all the teeth, I am sure he/she would not be able to eat this.The taste is also not that great compared to puffs and maple cinnamon crunchies."
1,Choking hazard for toddlers,"My daughter, nearly 16 months old, nearly choked to death on these. She has had them many times before, but one got lodged in her throat and it quickly turned into an emergency. I never expected this from a product that is supposed to break up and is recommended for crawlers and babies as young as 6 months. Thank God my husband is an EMT and was here."
2,Scary!!,"I personally don't like these. My daughter tries to shove the whole wagon wheel in her mouth and then proceed to choke on them. She's 1, so its not like she can't chew. My daughter apparently doesn't like biting things and would rather just shove the whole cookie in her mouth. For that reason, I won't buy any more. I have to constantly pry them out of her mouth."
4,Gorgoroth's aim avoids cliche,"Gorgoroth's key objective is emotion. On ""Antichrist"", their concept is based around the mysteries of medieval metaphor, through melodies and (now) lengthy opuses reflecting a romantic touch to the dark ages. This would turn into cliche by lesser artists, but Gorgoroth make it beautiful. The sound production is fuzzier and less distinct than on their previous release, percussion is ritually repetitive and vocals now and then form a clean chant, all in order for this band to broaden their horizons in sorrow-filled music. Initially seemingly aimless, this disc turns out to be a masterful, almost baroque-inspired piece of dark art."
5,Great.,"Kenny Rogers Is 1 Of The Best Country Music Singers Of All-Time. His Number 1 Hit ""Through The Years"" Crossed Over To The Pop Charts. I Like ""Love Will Turn You Around"". ""Lady"" Is Another Classic Balled. This CD Is A Must Buy."
1,explanation please,"I just received my cd. My problem is: the track listing you wrote on here is different than what's on the cd. Mine starts with ""Love will turn you around"" and goes to ""You decorated my life."" The song i wanted, ""Have I told you lately,"" is not on mine. I purchased the disc based on the track listing here. Please explain."
1,i have never heard a worse-sounding CD,"This sound quality on this box set is HORRID, like it was recorded thru a microphone near a speaker. From a Canadian company called OnQ, it is labelled as using a UV22 encoding scheme to preserve original high definition sound. It's anything but."
4,AIR DOOR ACTUATOR,"GOOD SERVICE, AND GOOD PRICE, BUT BE AWARE THAT THIS ITEM IS NOT FOR MANUAL TEMPERATURE CONTROL UNITS. APPARENTLY, DORMAN DOES NOT MAKE A UNIT FOR MANUAL TEMPERATURE CONTROL UNITS."
5,"Great video, brief and to the point lotto stratagies.","Great video, brief and to the point lotto stratagies. Covers several lotteries including Lotto649 and 6 to 9 number lotteries too..."
5,Fly me to the Moon,"I first heard Matt Monro many years ago when I was much younger. On dates I would dance to his music, his voice is just like velvet and he can make an evening unforgetful. I would love to find some of his music, but don't know where."
1,Disappointing with photos that aren't that good,Unfortunately this book is quite disappointing. About 30 years ago or more another book entitled IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF JESUS was published in Israel and is far superior. Many of these photos are wasted space. An Arab man with a camel is not going to give me an indication of the Holy Land during the time of Jesus. Many of the great Holy Sites are not in the book. Buyer beware.
5,Quotations Buff Loves It,"I am a fan of quotations and have always tapped into these simple, but profound wisdoms to enhance my life. Beyond a doubt, this author has meticulously selected some of the best. His noting the benefit of applying these to your own personal aspirations really hit home with my belief that they are personal tools, not just entertainment. I would highly recommend this book, not only to those who enjoy quotations or write speeches, but to all who would like to improve their life by tapping into the great wisdom vaults we all should treasure."
5,A must-have for TMBG fans,"It's fab, it's quirky and really a must-have for anyone interested in one of the silliest, talented bands of all time!"
1,I have purchased and received 2 defective copies!,"I love the music on this CD! Unfortunately, I cannot enjoy it! I have purchased 2 copies through Amazon, one used, one new. Both copies were defective. The sound quality is unacceptable! It is garbled and full of static! How can I get a good copy? Are there MP3 downloads? I am SO MAD!!"
1,"You can get all of theese songs off of ""Dial A Aong: 20 Years Of They Might Be Giants""except 2",...............................
2,What is this?!,"I've been a fan of They Might Be Giants since the early 1990's, and I own all of their major releases, plus a couple not so major releases. I picked this CD up last night having not ever sen or heard anything about it before and thought ""Oh yay! New versions of some of my favorite songs"". Boy was I wrong.These aren't new versions of old songs, these are old versions of old songs. They are the exact same recordings I already own scattered across several CDs, there is absolutely nothing new here.I'd have been fine with this if I knew what I was getting, but there was absolutely no indication on the packaging that these were all old recordings."
2,This friggin' sucks,"What the frell. It's another frellin' compilation. They Might Be Giants can't be bothered to get off their arse and do anything new except for a baby's album, so they are rehashing old material again (If you want a half-decent compilation, get the Dial-A-Song 2 CD Compilation - more great material).Seriously, there's nothing new here. Go buy ""Dial-A-Song"""
3,Why?,"I can't figure this group out. Obviuosly they are a kids band, but I love a lot of their songs. It is just the ones never compiled. Why do we get the light shines song, which is not catchy or clever, don't let's start, which sucks, hotel detective, a loser of a song, boss of me, which I hate, bangs and all kinds of their worst material. I guess my recommendation is to get the albums and have fun treasure hunting."
4,No new tracks,"This has no new tracks, it is not designed for existing fans of the band, it is for you to make new fans with!!As that, I think it will do pretty well, considering it has some of everything.A good introduction to the band, 4/5."
2,Another Best Of (after the Dial-A-Song compilation) of TMBG,"Well, if you've never bought a TMBG CD before, this one could be really nice for you! It's a perfect view over the wide and funny range of TMBG.But if you already own some CDs by TMBG (maybe even the Dial-A-Song compilation): why buy this? It doesn't contain ANY new song, not even one or two new songs, no, just NO new song... Could this really have been the wish of the 2 Johns, or was it just an idea of their record company? But why then in May, not for Christmas? I just don't understand it..."
3,I cannot find any information about virtual machine. --,"this book shows the good example of beginning course book about computer system. However, I am sorry that this big book cannot provide useful information about its title.If you already know compiler and computer architecture, reading this book make your time wasted."
2,"Quite a entry level book, no much useful information","If you are a beginner on computer technology, this book may provide some good information. Otherwise it is little value for a professional programmer. The book also can be much shorter. Don't know why it list all those source code. Kind of wasting paper."
5,My people die for lack of Knowledge,"The over all message of this book, is called Freedom!This book is a must for every Christian that seeks to knowMore about the Word and how it can set you free.Ask, Seek, Knock."
3,SOLID DEBUT,"Trisha Covington is just one of those artist who came onto the music scene and disappeared just as quickly. The album is good, but got little promotion. With the right promotion, Trisha would've been one of those female artist that would've stayed around for a long time. Her first single got a lot of airplay but it wasn't enough to put her onto the scene. Overall, good album, bad promotion."
3,"Nice single, never heard the cd","Never heard the cd? Why am I writing this review? Well, I have spent the lat year trying to remember the name of the lady who sang the song, ""Slow Down"". Finally went to onehitwondercentral.com and found out it was the lovely Trisha Covington. The single ""Slow Down"" was one of my favorites and bein a teenager in the 10th grade at the time, the video was as well. I never got a chance to hear the cd, but based off the lackluster success of it, it couldn't have been too good. But the single was off the hook."
4,"Small, but Great Collection","Like many, many other pick-ups of Ernie, this offers hymns with backup that includes the San Quentin prison choir, the Jordanaires, and a mixed choir of professional singers and friends. Great to listen to, but ends too soon. Maybe more of his work will be rereleased like Johnny Cash. Ernie sang in a day when people recorded albums not just singles. Its a shame that more of his work isn't available, but until then decent collections like this will have to keep us satisfied."
3,ho-hum,"This isn't a bad book. It isn't a good book. It just seems pretty standard issue. There aren't any surprises in the story line and I found the artwork to be somewhat stilted. However, if you're a fan of magic and mayhem, check it out."
4,Very good but a little pricey,"This is a great CD to begin to learn sign language with your children. It teaches commonly used basic signs, and is just the right length, and has just enough activity, to be just right for our 2 and 4 year old grandchildren's attention span. I would be a little happier if it had two short episodes on the CD instead of just one. Contents are very good."
5,Signing Time Vol. 2 is great,My son really took off using signs once I bought the videos for him to watch. I tried for months to teach him on my own. He picked up more words at a faster rate with the videos. I recommend them highly!
2,Not what I expected...,"I had bought my daughter (now 15 months) the 2 videos of ""My Baby Can Talk"" and she loves them. Since there is not a third part I thought of ordering one from this series to try it. She just didn't like it. The format is not as good as the other videos. Maybe if I had used these series since the beginning I could say something different, but my daughter and I are still in love with ""My Baby Can Talk""..."
5,The Signing Time Series is awesome!,"You have to get this DVD just for ""The Silly Pizza Song"" if nothing else! The truth is this whole DVD series is top notch and keeps getting better and better.I find this DVD series best for children at least 12 mths. + and the children who like it best seem to be 18-24+ The production is top notch, the songs are catchy, and Rachel, Alex and Leah are wonderful on the DVD's. For younger children 6-24 mths. I always recommend The Treasure Chest: Toys and Signs, but for children older than that the Signing Time series can't be beat.I currently have volumes 1-6 and have 7-9 on the way and never hesitiate to recommend these DVD's to anyone!"
5,You can't go wrong with Signing Time!,"Teaching a young child sign language can eliminate temper tantrums, boost their IQs, enhance their motor skills, and of course it allows them to be able to communicate with deaf children and adults. So if you're going to put forth the time and effort to teach your child a language with these kinds of advantages, you want to make sure you've got the best teaching resource that there is today. And that would be SIGNING TIME! Your kids can ""come and play"" with Leah (who is deaf) and Alex (who can hear)in their magical treehouse where they will learn American Sign Language in an easy and fun way. Leah and Alex, along with Leah's mom, Rachel Coleman, model all the essential playtime signs (please, thank you, your turn, my turn, etc.)that a child needs to communicate. Combine that with fun, original songs written and performed by Rachel and colorful, attention-grabbing animation, and you've got a recipe for success!"
4,My son loves it!,"I purchased this DVD for my one year old son. He loves it! I play it for him once a day and each time he sees me put it in, he lets out this excited little scream. It was money well spent. I will have to say that the lady running the show drives me a little bit crazy, however, I think the more current DVD's she has put out are a little less annoying. But as I said, my son loves it no matter how annoying she may be to me! I would definitely recommend purchasing it!"
2,A little fast for learning,It is an entertaining DVD but is a little fast paced making it hard to follow. I would not have purchased the product if I had viewed it prior to purchase.
4,Great set of videos,"My sons really enjoy signing time. They make learning signs fun and Rachel does a nice job of explaining the signs and why they are signed that way.It's definitely geared for kids, I had a hard time getting past Rachel's enthusiasm and pushed smile, but my kids love it and we've enjoyed watching Alex and Leah grow. I definitely recommend these sets of DVD's for kids."
4,"very convenient, but rather pricey for just Vaseline...","Although Vaseline Lip Therapy has the phase ""advanced formula"" on the tube, the active ingredient in the product is listed as 100% ""white petroleum USP"". Lip Therapy is really just Vaseline in a tube.As most of us already know, Vaseline is pretty effective as a treatment for chapped lips. Lip Therapy is convenient to carry, with a well designed applicator that is comfortable to use. Of course if you do a cost analysis, even at about a dollar, you are paying a premium price for just 0.35 ounces of Vaseline in a tube. With the shipping charge added in, buying from Amazon would appear to be too pricey an option for most. The four star rating is for the product, which can probably be found much cheaper at your local drugstore."
4,decent read,I like the short chapters and the related articles in the back. I also find the various inserts of real-life examples good for comprehending some of the heady jargon that isn't so obvious.
4,Very Wordy! LOL!,"This book is great, but at the same time it is extremely wordy. It would be nice if it had more examples, case studies, charts and graphs rather than mostly words to convey messages. Personally, I am more of a visual person, so for me, this is over the top."
3,Mislead,"The condition of the book was listed as new but it definitely was not. There were highlights and markings throughout the book. It was actually in good condition but like I said, definitely not new."
3,Strategic HR Management,"The provider sent this out immediately - I thought I might not get the book in time for class but it was at my home in just a few days. I give the provider 5 stars for efficiency and timely delivery. I wasn't expecting the book to come from a company in Maylasia. The only problem that I've discovered in the book - and I have not asked classmates if their book has this - but there were quite a few typos in the book. Since these go through substantial editing, I wasn't sure if I had gotten a copy of the final version of the book."
4,Worked for our nursery,"Overall fabric color, pattern and quality nicer than anticipated. Quality of upholstry mediocre, some visible stabled on corner of chair back. Dimensions of chair when utilizing the rocker (which need to be listed with the product!):Height of Arm - 23"" from floor to top of armHeight of Back - 33"" from floor to top of chair back (not high enough for an adult to lean head against)Depth of Seat -22""Depth of Arm - 30"" from front to where joins chair backShipping experience was good, arrived 1 week faster than scheduled. While box had a significant hole in it, no damage to inside chair.Very easy to assemble (less than 10min)."
2,"Incredible fabric, but....","What we did like....The fabric on this chair is nothing like the picture, it is far more beautiful with great texture. It also comes with the stationary legs for the chair if you want to change them at another time....nice thought!What we didn't like...the back of the chair only came up to the bottom of my shoulder blades. I realize I am tall, but we were planning to use it in the nursery and figured that we would want to fall asleep in it occasionaly without our heads being able to bend all of the way backward due to lack of support. When the rocker arrived the box was torn and had a hole in it. There was a small scratch from the exposure to the ""outside"", but we were willing to get over it. What we weren't willing to get over was the damage done to the arm of the chair due to the back of the chair's placement for shipping. It was completely worn down and the padding permanently dented."
2,Moderate to Poor Quality,"The chair is very low; the facbric (after two weeks) is shifting on the cushion, making it look cheesy. Not going to last ~ ultimately a waste of money"
2,"Hard, Small, Does Not Rock on Carpet","I purchased this rocker with the matchingCarolina Cottage Upholstered Jacquard Ottoman, Green. The chair is very easy to assemble. The chair back's fabric had a large discolored stripe on arrival. The manufacturer sent a new back within two weeks. Some stapling is visible on sides and bottom of chair.The chair does not rock on carpet. I called the manufacturer to make sure I had the runners positioned correctly, which they were. Also, the back is very short, coming just short of my shoulders. The seat and back are far too firm, even for someone who likes a firm chair. Overall, it is attractive, but uncomfortable."
1,Cottage rocker,Chair had a large mark on the back cushion. Not what I expected.Would not have purchased this chair if I knew it was so small.
3,Not really a rocking chair,"The chair looks nice, with decent upholstery and apparently good workmanship. It's a large, heavy, solid product. It comes with four peglegs and two rocking attachments, so you choose how you'll use it. We bought the chair specifically to use as a rocker, but on that count, it fails miserably. It barely moves at all, no matter how much effort you give it. We have a carpeted floor, so we put a heavy plastic mat beneath the chair; the mat makes no difference. You may have slightly more luck putting it directly on a hardwood floor. My advice is to get it if you want a stationary club chair, but pass on this if you're looking for a rocker."
4,Very Happy With This,"The Carolina Cottage Club rocking chair fits perfectly in my livingroom. I love the fact that it can be changed from the rocking chair to the standing chair easily and quickly, simply by removing the rockers and screwing in the 4 legs. Actually, I was pleasantly surprised when I found the 4 legs included! Friends who have sat in the chair were also quite comfortable. -Amazon Verified Purchase-"
2,Mission Impossible and Get Smart previews!,"These two episodes give us sneak previews of Mission Impossible (not just a couple of space bums) and Get Smart with the mission premise in Strigas and Mandy/99 in Never. If you must get this tape, get it only for the two spy series that eclipsed this show!"
2,Little more information required.,It is missing information about who were the actual thinkers on whose views the theory Postcolonialism is based.
5,A peacefully mellow stringed performance!,The perfect adult relaxation to end a long day at work. Great for all adult ears!!
4,Kaira - Peace,"This solo album by Toumani Diabate is really a nice piece. However, it has a very different feel from Toumani's other popular recording, New Ancient Strings. Kaira is more earthy and raw sounding, whereas the acoustic used to record N.A.S. allows some echo, which really changes the mood. Kaira has no echo at all. But this does not make it unworthy! The music is excellent, especially the second track, Jarabi, my personal favorite. Overall a very good rootsy kora recording, with very nice pieces."
5,"Beautiful, delicate, and elegant!","This dress looks even better ""in person"" than it does on a picture. It is really delicate, the ivory color is a beautiful golden shade - a perfect flower girl dress! This one will definitely turn your little beauty into a little princess :-)"
4,I Like...,"This CD is such a terrific CD, which makes me frustrated that yet again, just because this CD isn't a ""PoP"" Cd, it hasn't gotten it's just desserts! It seems that only the artist that ""cross-over"" ever get the recognition and admiration from the ""pubic"", therefor leaving terrific R&B;/Soul/Gospel left in ""fame limbo"". When you strip away the band/music of a lot of these new singers, it just show that their vocal abilities are ""lacking"" compared to a lot of artist in the above mentioned genre's. Come on people....lets support these guys as they are truly worthy of much love and adoration!!!Rick"
1,"""PICTURES and DESCRIPTIONS CAN BE DECEIVING""!","The ""Unique Arts In Ground Copper Birdbath"" sold by Amazon.com LLC, was a ""HUGE Dissapointment...Not what I ordered at all. The picture doesn't even come close to what I received, and what I received doesn't even work together, as the birdbath holder does NOT hold the birbath dish correctly!! I left a VM for Unique Arts, to give them a chance to fix this problem, and they NEVER called or emailed me back!! Also, the description of this birdbath is sooo deceiving, as there is not 1 part that is ""Solid Copper""Unique Arts In Ground Copper Birdbath. My suggestion....""Stay Away"" from Unique Arts, based out of Wisconsin:(("
5,Best birdbath available,"If you are looking for an excellent birdbath, this is the one. Others that are made of resin or cement become covered in mold and the paint is toxic and wears off.This birdbath is quality all the way and the copper bowl prevents bacteria, mold, and fungus from growing on it. The copper bowl lifts out easily to empty and refill with water. The artwork is simple and elegant. The bird appears to be solid brass. The base that is inserted in the ground is heavy metal and hammers into the ground easily providing very steady and straight support. We love it."
3,Been a long time.,"The concept: ""11 struggling young bands interpret some of LED ZEP's most bitchin' tunes"". The excecution: pretty good, for the most part. Nothing is great, but nothing is awful, either. All the performers come up with different interpretations of these classic songs, some more succesfully than others. The most interesting ones are a rap version of ""Black Dog"" and an acoustic version of ""Rock and Roll"". Zeppelin fans who are interested in hearing new interpretations of the band's songs should give it a listen."
1,Buy Encomium instead,"Based on the Amazon preview, I'm really glad I didn't waste my money on this album. Geez, it sounded like a bunch of 16 year old hacks destroying any classic Zep song they could find. I didn't hear anything new or challenging in the songs. Just a challenge to get through the mangled noise. This goes the same for the second album in this series. Why they felt the need to make a second album like this is beyond me..."
4,'bout time!,"OK, this is one of those albums (along w/ The Pointer Sisters' ""Priority,"" Tony Joe White's ""The Real Thang,"" Moby Grape's ""20 Granite Creek,"" Terence Boylan's ""Suzy,"" and Hamilton Camp's ""Here's To You"") that I've been eagerly awaiting re-release on CD. I'm one of those who freely admit that I thoroughly DETESTED Led Zepplin (even though, when I was young, I had to perform several of their songs in various ""band incarnations"") - I mean, I would LOVE to hold Jimmy ""Junkie"" Pages's head under water till he admitted that Jeff Beck was 10 times his superior, and Rob't Plant? Oh be serious...that hideous falsetto of his reminded me of Frankie ""Grease"" Valli. STill: a rap version of ""Black Dog"" is freaking BRILLIANT, as is the rockabilly version of ""Livin' Lovin' Maid."" Get this CD - and, OK, I'll be ""fair,"" here, I can't wait till some ""artists"" do the same thing to the Stones..."
3,"The good, the bad and the beauty","A quite convincing bad Ice-T plays the boss of a gang that plans to rob a luxury liner on a Pacific cruise. As it happens most the time in such movies, there is a good guy too: Dylan Walsh plays a security guard who fights them. But there is more troubles for the passengers, as the ship has a damage...Even though i personally found 'Final Voyage' not as spectacular as for example 'Under Siege' or 'Die hard', i liked it and found it quite entertaining. Dylan Walsh surprised me with a really good performance, Erika Eleniak is as always: not that much performance, but yet so cute and certainly more than just decoration !"
1,One of the worst movies ever,"You know how airlines, aside from Quantas, don't show in-flight movies that involve crashes or hijackings?Well, a ferry that I was on in eastern Indonesia showed this film, centered around a hi-jacked sinking ship, which was pretty funny considering their ferry system is plagued with sinkings and the country is also plagued with terrorists. The programming director for their ferries must be a true nihlistWhat was even funnier was that the movie was subtitled in Thai, which meant only people that could understand English or read Thai would follow what was happening.The best moment of the movie was when the terrorists hi-jack the sinking cruiser and my travelling companion, who is English, commented, ""What are these guys, Irish?""This comic relief was the only thing that made the ferry trip tolerable. I don't think this movie would be tolerable in any other situation."
2,WALSHED AWAY,"I like Dylan Walsh. His boyish good looks and ability to throw off some clever lines has been a part of most of his movies. However, in FINAL VOYAGE, Dylan is merely window dressing, along with lovely Erika Eleziak in this muddled, confusing and ultimately ultraviolent mess. Ice T is awful as the hedonistic leader of this motley crew; Claudia Christian is gorgeous as always but looks she belongs in another movie. The obvious differences in what ship was being filmed are glaring, and while it packs some interesting action, it ultimately falls into the B movie, subdivision. Oh, Rick Dicommun as Jasper saves the movie with his comic relief."
1,2 hours of my life I'll never get back,"I can't describe how awful this movie is. I'd give it no stars if I could. It's like the makers have never heard the word ""continuity"" before... or plot... or knew anything about character development, let alone ANYTHING about ships. The only parts even remotely redeeming were the shots taken on board the Queen Mary."
3,A bizarre comic fantasy ...,"During the '30s, René Clair was considered one of the cinema's most stylish innovators and satirists... Now, however, both the 'poetic realism' and the exuberant humor on which his reputation once rested seem shallow and dated...A critic, and a poet and actor in the serials of Louis Feuillade, the young Clair aligned himself with the French avant-garde of the '20s... Indeed, his silent work may be seen as offshoots of the Dada movement: his debut, ""Paris Qui Dort"" (""The Crazy Ray""), was a bizarre comic fantasy in which a mad scientist uses a magic ray to render the city immobile; only a group of strangers, safe atop the Eiffel Tower or in a plane, remain conscious to search for the culprit and bring Paris back to life..."
5,Must Have,"If you grew up on 80's glam metal like I did, then this is a cd you must add to your collection. The rarities alone make this a must have."
4,Instant Karma's Going To Get You,"Note: Cantonese with English subtitles.'Running On Karma' is a rather strange, off-the-wall film dealing with the harsh reality of karmic debt, or pay-back as understood within Eastern Philosophy.Starring two of the most popular Chinese actors/actresses in recent years, Andy Lau and Cecilia Cheung, director Ka-Fai Wi and Johnny To weave a somewhat muddled, non-linear tale involving two nice people with the great misfortune of being hampered with bad karma derived from a previous incarnation.This film is something really different that you'll either love or have absolutely no idea what's going on. Give it a try, you might like it!"
5,Two classic Steppenwolf Albums in one!!!!,"I just ordered this and cannot wait to hear it again! I had both albums and I wore out my vinyl copies years ago, and have been waiting for the cd! I have been a fan of Steppenwolf since the olden days, and their music is as fresh today as it was then."
2,Not enough bubbles - switched and tossed the bottle half full,"I personally wasn't pleased with this product. I cannot speak from the other scents as I have only used the Lavenders scented from this brand. I put the amount on the bottle in the flow of the water and used my hand to splash around in the water to build the suds and unfortunately it didn't produce a whole lot. On top of that they went away very fast compared to pretty much every other brand I have used. The smell was pleasent and I did appreciate that. Unfortunately, after about 2 weeks use my daughter developed a rash all over her lower body - literally the rash line stopped right around where the water line in the bath tub usually sits on her skin. We went several days ruling out any and everything that could have caused the issue and it came down to the bubble bath being the last thing on the list that could of caused it.Others may enjoy this product my myself personally it just wasn't worth it and we switched to her old bubble bath."
5,Great for babies with eczema,"Based on an article we read, we tried this out for use with our son who has eczema. It seems to work pretty well - doesn't dry his skin out during his bath. We are already on our second bottle!"
4,good product,I've ordered this product 2 times now and just placed an order for 2 more. This bubble bath makes a nice amount of bubbles and isn't drying to the skin. I have a 3 year old daughter and we haven't had any issues with infections or irritation with this bubble bath. We tried Cali baby and Burts Bees and didn't like either of those at all. Little Twig gets my vote for the best bubble bath!! The only reason I'm giving 4 stars and not five is the price. $15 for bubble bath is a bit much.
1,Buyer Beware,"Note that the item pictured is not the item that you are ordering. The model number T1692C is for the 2 way speaker and the item pictured is the 3 way, T1693C. This is still a good price for the 2 way and I got mine within a week or so from teracing12. Anyway, its too much trouble to try to send them back and argue with the company. Guess I'll just have to remember that if a deal seems too good to be true then..."
2,Out of Date,"The CD-ROM that comes with this computer contains an old version of Red Hat Linux, version 6.0, as opposed to the latest version 6.2. It didn't have the drivers for my newer computer, so I purchased the 6.2 box, and this really is significantly better. Since the book just covers 6.0, I've found the Red Hat documentation to be more useful than it. Even if this book were up to date, it is still poorly organized and incomplete. I just purchased the book Special Edition Using Red Hat Linux, and while it is lengthy, it covers 6.2 (with CD-ROM) and seems quite straightforward."
1,Lakoff simply doesn't get it!,"Lakoff would have us believe that conservative thought is based on a strict parent Idealogy.Wrong! Liberalism is. Consider this; In a strict parent house one must abandon their individual freedom of choice for whatever the parent thinks is best. The child gets a allowance and shelter but in turn loses many of his rights. This what Socialism and Liberalism does. Conservativism on the contrest is a free thinking parent, who realizes that children have to learn from there mistakes and that, when nesscary, they should step in for guidance."
1,You won't get the truth about Islam here.,"This man is on the payroll of Saudi Arabia and by Palestinian Business men who hate Jews and the West. He is the Middle East's puppet. Beware of this mans writing. He is nothing but a shill for the Jihadis. You will find no truth here, only the fifth column. Georgetown University should be ashamed to have this man on staff."
3,Interesting but disappointing,"This book came highly recommended to me in understanding the basics of Islam. Although I DID gain some understanding, I found it too dry. It did not fire my imagination and I got the creeping sensation that Mr. Esposito was an apologist more than shedding light on this complex religion. He does not provide enough concrete examples behind his theories and I was left to wander what he meant by several of his observations. I suppose this book might be required reading in a college course on Islam but it left me dry."
2,Book leaves somtihing out....,"I only give this book 2 stars because it does not give the true account of Mohommad's life. He had sex with children - that is a fact. Read the Hadith, it plainly states that mohammed had sex with girls at least 7-8 years old. If he were alive today he would be arrested and put in jail. I would then call mohammed a pedophile pervert.Why dont we hear the truth about islam and not this watered down version?"
5,The Straight Path: A Great Read,"Islam: The Straight Path is an excellent, accurate primer for the non-Moslem who wants to an accurate, academic, yet ultimately readable introduction to this largely unknown religion. Most Americans have no understanding of Islam and fear Moslems because of the disturbing misinformation spread abroad by hate-mongering voices. A billion Moselms live in peace. We are now seeing the rise of a small segment of dangerous fundamentalists that have threatened world peace. An accurate understanding of this great religion is essential to approach the world situation in a rational fashion. This book provides a first look."
5,"Very, very good and very rare now...,","This was my first purchase from amazon.com; I was quite pleased with it. This album is no longer available in any format now; whether CD, cassette, or LP. I wanted the vinyl LP version of it, and I was only able to find it here. The record is in very good shape; There are 11 songs on the album including the minor hits ""Monday Morning Secretary"" and ""Woman Without A Home."" In addition, the Statlers give their own ""group"" sound to Tanya Tucker's ""Delta Dawn"" and Bob Dylan's ""I'll Be Your Baby tonight. The most intriguing thing about this album are the string arrangements, the most interesting being ""I Want To Carry Your Sweet Memories (to my Grave)"". For a 1972 release, the stereo sound quality is very high. All in all, a good album and if you're a Statler fan like I am, you'll definitely want this LP."
3,Kinda Creepy,"We bought a lot of the melissa and doug large wild animal plush...this guy has an odd expression and overall appearance...and he sheds a good bit too, leading to my kids coughing up fuzz"
5,Terrific!!,"I have never found a sports bra that I could jog in without hurting. I have always been large breasted (DD) and figured I would never find a bra that would support me. Well this one is it!! It's comfortable, but so supportive. The straps are adjustable so they don't dig into your shoulders. You won't be disappointed."
2,Fits Well But Bottom Rolls,"Fits well, does not hold breast in place and the bottom seam rolls.Feels uncomfortable. You have to keep unrolling all day.Straps are nice."
4,great runner,This sports bra has been a really great running bra. I am sad it will be replaced but the new Juno seems to be a bit more stylish. I would recommend buying some of these before they are all gone. I am a 34 D and will not run in any other bra.
2,dislike,I bought it because Im large chested and the elastic band keeps twisting and curling. Not happy with the purchase:(
1,Don't understand why people like this bra,"After hearing all the great things about this bra, I bought it for running and was excited to give it a try. Boy was I greatly diappointed. This bra is flimsy and did not provide any support. I'm only a 36B, I don't know how anyone larger could like this bra. My old Champion bras give much better support. I returned this bra, the material was thin, provided no modesty coverage and had no support. I can't see how it's rated to be a high support bra for running."
3,Light support,"The only reason I kept this bra is because the tags snapped off while I was trying it on.I only use it for yoga and stretching -- activities that don't involve bouncing. In a 40DD, it does nothing to stop bounce. Since it gives you uniboob (I just expect this in a sports bra), they do bounce together. Maybe that's something.It is very soft and pretty comfortable. I like the ""flamingo"" color. As other reviewers have stated, the band does roll up, which is not great.I tried four different Moving Comfort bras. I also ended up keeping the Maia bra, which I like much better than the Fiona. Still, none of them offer the support I want. For high-impact activities, Enell is the only one I've found that keeps the girls in place. It's ugly, but it works."
1,Ridiculous and incorrect sizing,"I wear a 34D bra, and ordered this in the same size. The bra was ok in the band measurement, but the cup size was a B, at most. It was ridiculously tiny and also weirdly centered. If your breasts grow out of your sternum, I suppose this will work. This was definitely not a size D or C bra. It was labeled 34D but in actuality must have been a B to be this tiny. Returning. Disappointed. All 3 bras I bought from this brand are going right back and I am never buying from them again. Stick to Nike, Under Armour, Adidas."
4,For the bold,"This bra seemed very well made and was comfortable. The fit was nice as well. My only issue with it was the lack of substance in the cup area, which is common with sports bras. I was hopping for something with a little more padding though so as not to expose a nipple bump."
3,Some Elastic issues,I really like the support of this bra- I have no trouble at all when I am running in it and the straps are really comfortable. The elastic at the bottom had already started to roll up at the end of the first day I wore it though. I am afraid that I would not purchase another one because of this issue. The band seems to be poorly made to last unlike other sport's bras that I have used.
5,Best Bra Ever,"Awesome sports bra for high impact sports. I highly recommend it. I run alot of miles and this bra keeps ""things"" where they should be and so far, knock on wood, no chaffing. :)"
5,GREAT SUPPORT,"I love this bra I am a 36 D and I feel very supported in this bra on my long jogs, short runs, aerobics, and yoga. Fits perfect, wears well, washes well (I hand wash and air dry), very comfortable, and gives a good silhouette. It does minimize my chest size a little but not very much and the support it gives is worth it."
2,Um what support?!?!,"I'm so confused. I thought this was a supportive sports bra for C's and up??? I needed another sports bra for my high cardio workouts, and contemplated buying this for the longest time (I have previously bought a moving comfort racerback bra that I love but is now no where to be found) and seeing that there was over 300 reviews figured it would be awesome! Bought my regular bra size, which fits great and I love the non-racerback/velcro straps design, but here's the thing. When you say a sports bra is supportive, I'm thinking supportive under the bust and it keeps the ladies from BOUNCING. One of of two ain't bad right? It's definitely supportive under the bust, but the bouncing? I was simply trying it on and jumped up a down a couple times, and I couldn't handle all the bouncing. Oh and it's barely lined! So beware! Because if it's cold in the room, others will definitely know. This is definitely going back."
4,Much Better than expected!,"As a runner who wears a 32DD bra I'm always on the hunt for a comfortable yet supportive athletic bra. My favorite brand is pretty expensive so I thought I would try another that seem to get great reviews. When I received my Moving Comfort Fiona bra I did not have high hopes that it would live up to my expectations. The bra did not look or feel like it would do it's job but I decided to give it a try. Much to my surprise, the bra did exactly what it claims to do. I had great support with little movement and I did not feel like my lungs were being constricted by the band. I love that the bra does not need to be pulled over your head (traditional band with hooks) and that the straps are adjustable. The straps do tend to be on the thick side which could bother people that don't like their bra to show through their shirts and you always get a bit of a uni-boob but if you can get past those ""problems"", it's a great choice for runners."
4,High-impact support,"This bra does offer a great deal of support for the active exerciser. I was unsure of sizing, so I got a C-cup for my normally B to C-cup frame. The 3-hook back closure fit snugly and the adjustable straps made up for my over-compensating in size--the was NO movement on my first workout after getting this sport bra.Another reviewer mentioned that the back began to curl up on her ""Fiona Bra"", same here. I suggest for anyone experiencing this problem , adjust the back hook to the next loosest setting. I think the curling may have happened from too much pulling. The adjustment made a difference for me.Bottom line, this sport bra is comfortable (if not very cute), and keeps the movement to a minimum when I work out. I'd recommend it for anyone with a cup size of B,C,D."
3,It does give support for size of C/D,"This is true to size, as I am between a C and D and it's fit is pretty good. I run everyday for 4 to 7 miles on treadmill. The back bottom is curling up and not holding down. YOu see the inside white part starting to fold up, don't like that. This happened after only 2 wears. I will say it's soft and does give you support that you need. Not sure how it holds up long term? We will see....I am not sure I will buy this again, I am still searching for the perfect one."
5,Fantastic find.,"I wear a 32E. I have searched a long time for the perfect running bra. I spent probably two hours trying on all the so called ""running"" bras at Dick's Sporting Goods. I was nearly in tears at the end of that shopping disaster. Every brand they had in various sizes. Addidas, Nike, champion...... yadda yadda. Nothing worked! The smalls were too tight at the bust with cups spilling over, the mediums would either be too loose at the band or too tight on the bust, and the larges were tooo large. or the straps would be too loose and not adjustable. I tried everything on. None of them delivered the promise on the tag. Feeling defeated I left the store empty handed. I decided to try Amazon as a last ditch. I was skeptical about buyin a bra. The Fiona is a perfect fit. It has perfect coverage. It has phenomenal support. Perfect for running. It does more than any other bra ever has. I love love love it."
5,Sports Bra,This is the most comfortable sports bra I have ever worn.What I like about it is the straps are NOT criss/cross your back and are adjustableto your shoulder. Also the closure has 3 hooks and is adjustable as it ages. It washes nicely and fits like a standard bra but has the support needed for the active woman.I am disappointed in the shoulder straps on this bra. The elastic as it wears causes irritation to the skin...Would not buy again...
5,BEST BRA EVER!!,"I purchased this bra for my grand daughter and she absoltely loves it!! She likes to sleep in bra's and she calls this the best sleep bra ever!!! It is very comfortable. It also doubled as a regular sports bra, therefore, you feel secure when running, walking, biking, playing basket ball, socker or any other sport that you like! Yes, I would purchase this one again in all the colors!"
1,Awful!,"I wanted to love it..all the glowing reviews gave me immense hope. Seriously, I don't understand the attraction. Wish I had returned it, instead of giving it the chance it didn't deserve. :(It's awful!!1. Offers very little support and zero bounce control.2. Flimsy. No structure whatsoever.3. A limp, shapeless piece of fabric.4. Cups are strange and loose.5. Bottom band shifts out of shape in the front, turning and twisting.6. It's very noticeable under tee shirts.I measured carefully, per instructions. The result was my usual bra size. That's what I ordered and it's so oversized! The cups seem huge.Bummer."
3,Moving Comfort Fiona Bra,There was not enough support in this bra for me. Color and style was cute. No lift and very little support. Total uni-boob. Sent this back.
5,Best fit for high impact support,I love this sports bra by Moving Comfort. The adjustability in the straps assures a customized fit. I use this for running and it provides great support!
4,Soft but better for cool weather than hot summer days,The bra is very soft and comfortable; I love the adjustable straps. I may have gotten one size too large because there is a bit of a gap under my arms but it doesn't bother me. My only concern is that it is fairly heavy and may be too warm for exercising in the summer.
3,Support and comfort...but not as much as I had hoped,"I'm a runner, fitting a regular bra between a DD and DDD, depending on the manufacturer. I ordered the 34DD, and I think it fits me well, without any flubbing or smooshing (than typical). However, I didn't think this had the support that others are saying it has. Could just be me, but I asked a trusted friend to give me her honest opinion, and she felt I still had a lot of bounce going on. Comfort-wise, I felt fine, but she said as an observer, she was surprised that it didn't offer better control of the bounce and shift when I moved. So would I order them again? No, probably not. Is it comfortable, nice material, well constructed? Yes, I think so. But I've worn others that offered better control."
5,GREAT SUPPORT!,Great sports bra! Great for now ( active and 6months pregnant) and Im sure will be great later for higher impact fitness activities. Very comfortable.
3,Sizing is off,"I'm sure I'd like this if it was easier to get the correct size. I ordered a 30DD, I'm in between that size and the 32D and thought that since it's a sports bra a little small wouldn't be bad. Not only was the band tighter that I'm used to with a 30, the cups were also too small and my breasts were coming out of the top of the bra! Now I have no idea what size to get to make sure it fits. I love the pricing on amazon, but I'm going to have to find a store that carries those sizes (good luck) and try a few on or order a bunch of these and have to return what doesn't fit. Too much hassle! Is it really that hard to have consistent sizing?"
3,Comfortable.,"The Velcro straps are very supportive, the bra is comfortable, soft and lightweight for the support it provides. However, the bottom band slips."
5,great bra!,"I just ran a 5k and had absolutely no problems with this bra. It worked great! I normally have to wear 2 compression bras and a tight tank to keep things under control, but not any more. It's true to size, no rubbing issues, fits snugly but not too tight and no uniboob. I am super happy with and will be recommending to my fellow runners."
3,Moderate Support at Best,"I wear a 36D and I found this bra true to size and very comfortable. What I did not like was the support was not great. When I got it I tried it on and did a few jumping jacks and I was bouncing all over, no better than the inexpensive bras you can buy at any discount department store. In addtion the material is quite thin and my nipples showed through, not somehting I would want happening at the gym. I returned it. I would not recommend this for anyone who is doing high impact sports."
5,Perfect!,"This is exactly what I was looking for. Excellent support for larger busts. Fits great, very comfortable. Super supportive. I would purchase again and recommend."
3,Supportive but still lots of bouncing,"This sports bra is excellent in the support department. I love the fact that the straps are adjustable, although even at their shortest setting they are still a tad too long. The main issue is that I'm a 38D, and I still get a lot of bounce, even during a spin class, which would not be considered high impact. Overall it's a decent bra, but I'm still looking for something more effective."
3,nice colors!,"I like the colors and I like the velcro adjustment on the straps. The band is not as hefty or sturdy as I would have liked. It rolls over onto itself. In addition, It feels loose even though it is brand new."
5,"Good, but not for really high impact","I usually prefer a racer back sports bra because I find it offers better support for high-impact activities like running. But now I'm pregnant and my bra size is changing frequently, so I like the adjust-ability of the Fiona bra. It fits well, washes well, and has adjustable back and shoulder straps. My biggest complaint is that doesn't offer quite enough support for running/jumping, but is otherwise great for walking, biking, elliptical, etc. (I'm a size C). Overall, a great bra for the price but not great for really high impact.**** Update to my review -- I bought another Fiona with a smaller band and bigger cup size, and the fit is much better. Works great for running and interval training, still a little bounce with jumping."
2,It hurts sometimes,I have another sports bra like this but this one is not very good - the way the straps are built rub against my inside shoulder. Also the back end adjustable strap is too clunky and also rubs. No way I could wear this for a long run - which is why I bought it as a marathoner.
4,great for running,This is a great bra for running. The only problem I had with it was the straps rubbed a little.
3,Truthful opinion,"I purchased this bra based on all it's fantastic reviews. The truth is the bra is just okay. It certainly isn't the worse exercise bra I have put on, but its not the best either. I am a 38F and I truly have a big bust. My boobs flops when I exercise and not only does it hurt but I am a bit self-conscious of the visuals. ;) This bra did not stop the flop. It did smash them in a bit to reduce it some. The straps were comfortable as well as the overall comfort of the bra. I exercise 1 to 2 hours daily and I need a super reliable bra and this one just isn't it. I won't purchase another one and my hunt continues. If your exercise routine isn't going to be a medium to high impact you might find the bra great. Yoga and pilates would be fine. Jogging, fast walking, aerobics, cross-training... definitely not especially for those gals whose bust is larger."
2,Review,"It's not like the picture at all. I expected firm cups and more contouring and shaping and it is not. It is just like a soft cup, wireless bra. I wanted something that supports my breasts so that I can move, like run, or jump rope, but it does not do that. I am returning it :-("
3,This is a nice bra but not phenomenal,"I was excited to order this bra after reading the reviews. It is great quality and has fantastic support, but it really, really flattens me, almost to no cup size at all, and I wear a D. It seems to run small. I had to reorder in a larger size than usual, both cup size and around. One of the straps is driving me crazy with itching but I cannot figure out what it could be since the straps seem perfectly smooth. For running it would be ideal since it holds a woman in so much."
2,"trouble with quality, and no cup!","Although the design is good (adjustable straps and Three plush-backed hook-and-eye rows on band, as described in Product Features), but the material used is something that gets malodorous just in 2-3 hours. I have other brands I can use several times before such a bad smell is felt! So it's not my body problem, but the quality.And there's also no cup as described in product features! Honestly, I spent this much for getting these cups. Actually this was the distinguishing feature I was craving, and it made me happy when I read here that it has cups. But when I received it, there was no cup!So I feel it has really been a waste of money."
3,Good compromise,"I usually buy Enell sports bras, and have been looking for a less expensive alternative. I researched reviews in running magazines for bras for large breasted women and this was one of the top picks. The price point was great, the bra is comfortable, and fairly supportive for DD cups. I followed the other reviewers' advice of going down one size in both band and cup and got a good fit the first time.There is more movement than my regular brand, but this will work well for shorter running sessions or combination activities that are high impact only part of the time. I am personally not concerned with ""cute"" since I always wear a t-shirt or tank over my sports bra, but the Fiona comes in a variety of great colors for those who give such things more consideration.The Fiona is a good compromise between performance and price."
2,A bit disappointed,"I was a bit disappointed with this bra, as a 38D I didn't find it supportive enough for my sports needs. I found the Juno much better."
2,Not enough support,"This bra didn't offer enough support for larger cup sizes. I'm a 36C, and I run and play soccer. I've tried many different sports bras and this one didn't come close to supporting my chest while running. I felt the material was way to stretchy to prevent ""bounce"" and keep everything strapped down as a good sports bra should."
2,It didn't fit well,"I didn't like this bra as well as the other one I had bought at the same time (same company, different style), it fit different and I didn't like the Velcro straps. I returned it."
4,"The best I've found for small band, large cup size women!","I'm usually a 34DD but wear a 32D in this bra to ensure that nothing moves when I run. Started with a 34D and had to return, not snug enough. Comfortable, adjustable and durable. You can throw them through the washer and drier with no problem. My only wish is that it had the ""racer back"" so it didn't scream ""sports bra for busty girls"" so loudly from the back!"
5,Great Support,"I was hesitant to purchase a sports bra off the internet without trying it on because I do have rather large breasts (40C), but I was pleasantly surprised with the fit. It is true to size and looks exactly as pictured. Even though you do get a uniboob look,you know this bra is doing it's job with the great support it provides. The velco straps haven't posed any problems, but I don't quite understand why the maker just didn't use conventional adjustment straps. I will purchase another one shortly in a different color. Highly recommend."
4,Moving Comfort,Pretty Happy with this sports bra. Even happier i didn't pay the original/full price of $50.The fit looks great on! One of the best and it doesn't give you a uniboob. hahaI feel like there could be a bit more compression--- but the adjustable straps are a HUGE help. Would probably buy again.
4,Comfort and Support,"Fits perfectly (I'm a 32D) and is comfortable. Support is moderate and sufficient for most exercise activities. My only complaint is that the fabric doesn't dry quickly, and thus will feel wet for hour(s) after working out. All in all, a good buy for the price."
1,not a high motion control sports bra,This sports bra offers minimal support. I bought it based on reviews and that it called itself a high motion control/ high impact sports bra. I went jogging in it once and hated it.
4,"Very supportive, but the elastic left me hurting",This bra is great except that I am a marathon runner and with the longer distance runs the overly ribbed elastic rubs me raw around my rib cage. If the elastic was smooth this would not be a problem. I will use this bra but only for shorter distances.
4,"Good - yes, Great - no","This bra in a nutshell in my size 44DD:Pros -- very full coverage, nothing spilling out from any side.- soft, comfortable material.- sturdy, very little jiggle.Cons -- my nipples show through- uni-boob- rolls up a little bit in the backSide note: I am nursing my baby and while the Velcro straps do make it easy to unhook the strap, but it isn't the easiest to reattach.Overall, this bra is better than most, but If you are looking for perfect, this is not it."
5,Happy Nursing Mom,"I am a nursing mom but need to start doing more activity than just walking. I bought this sports bra based solely on the reviews of its support, but was very happy to discover that the strap construction allows it to be a nursing bra too! Two fabulous products in one. GENIUS. One glitch - I received a larger size than ordered, but it actually fits well, so I can't complain."
5,Best sports bra ever,"I love this bra for ashtanga yoga. I'm petite and a 34DDD, but all the sports bras I tried were heavy and bulky and the underwires stabbed and poked and rubbed when I did complicated yoga poses. I decide to try this in the 34DD (the closest I could get to my cup size) and it works! The support is super, but it's so smoothly constructed (with the velcro-adjust straps) that it feels like I'm hardly wearing anything. No matter how I bend, stretch, or twist, it's comfortable and never binding. If you are unhappy with the sports bras you've tried, this is a truly different option. The other Moving Comfort bras I checked out didn't work for me, but I own three of the Fionas and wear them for Zumba, jazzercise, yoga, and belly dancing. It's even pretty enough to wear as a camisole under a sporty top or hoodie."
4,Work well for my workouts,This is the second one I bought. The first one worked well for me for my workouts and when I am out hiking. Very comfortable.
3,Moving Comfort Women's Fiona Bra,"Moving Comfort Women's Fiona Bra Review: It's just ok. While it is a very comfortable bra, I don't feel it is good for running or high impact exercises. I bought it for jogging based on the reviews but only use it now for low impact exercises or walking. I'm glad I bought two different bras so I could ""test"" them out because this one didn't work out the way I had hoped. But like I said, I still use it around the house and for low impact exercises. The material is high quality and it is very very comfortable."
5,Very Comfortable,I looked all over town for a comfortable sports bra in larger sizes. No luck. I finally looked on Amazon and found this bra. It's worked out great. It's comfortable for yoga and gives good support. I ordered this in black because I was so happy with a white one I'd purchased earlier.
3,"Comfortable bra, medium support for C/D cups","This bra was advertised as high support for C/D cups on the Moving Comfort website. Well, it's fine for gym or floor exercises, but it definitely does not stop the bounce or headlights if you want to run in it. Also, I found the velcro straps on the front annoying - they strap towards the inside, i.e. your skin, and I keep feeling the bumps. Size wise, the sizing was good, I ordered what I normally do in VS. It has a back hook closure that's easy to take on and off. In the end I did not keep the bra because of the front velcro straps, but mainly because of the material. The material is the kind that snags easily on nails or anything else, and I imagine it will pill horribly in the washing machine. It is not the smooth kind of fabric, it's kind of soft and fabricy to the touch but in the wrong way."
4,Very pleased despite the Uni-boob!,"I have the Maia and now the Fiona. I am typically a 42DD but I got this in a 40DD. I would pick the Fiona over the Maia any day! I'll add that my breast tissue is not dense at all, very soft and very hard to get it to stay still!Pros:Very good support! I was uncertain about trying yet another wire-free bra but I'm impressed! I get more support from the Fiona than the Maia.Very comfortable! Big points here. I found the Maia to be quite uncomfortable.I love the front adjustable straps.The band is sturdy and stays in place.Con:Major Uni-boob! Maybe it's because of my particular breast tissue, but I almost laughed at myself when I put my tank on and looked in the mirror. The Maia looks much much better under clothing. But, I don't want a Sports Bra to look pretty I want it to hold me in place while being comfortable enough to want to wear it."
4,Great workout bra,"This is a great workout bra. It has plenty of support, dries fast, and the adjustable straps are nice. If a person is in between sizes I would suggest going up a size to ensure comfort around the rib cage."
2,Not if you need support,"I've been looking for a new sports bra and when I researched this one, it sounded like just the ticket. I'm a little over 50 and wear a 34DD. The bra is well made and comfortable, but there really isn't much support. It may be enough for a younger woman or someone with small breasts, but it didn't work for me at all. Darn it, I loved the green!"
4,Great for larger women,Great bra for larger women. I ordered a size down so that it would be tighter and really keep me in place during running. It works great and is very comfortable. Fits well too!
5,Great sports bra!,"I just had a baby and wanted to start up my workout regime again, but because I had a baby, my cup size increased and I needed more support to get through my workouts. I love this sports bra! It is adjustable so that I can get a snug fit and not feel as though I'm flopping around when I jump or run. The material is soft and comfortable and allows for me to wear nursing pads as well. I definetely recommend this bra to large busted women."
3,"Good, but certainly not great","I am a 36 D and have had a very hard time finding a sports bra that can control the bounce I get from running. I read up on the types of bras that are best for my size, and the encapsulated variety were described as the best. This bra was described as such and as an added bonus it had adjustable straps (I always have issues with the straps being too long), but, although the bra helps some, I don't feel like it really qualifies as an ""encapsulated"" bra. It's still hard to breathe a bit with the bounce on my chest, and especially hard to talk without gasping. This product just wasn't all that I was looking for. In order to control bounce as much as needed you would probably need to wear two.The search continues for an adequate sports bra."
4,Great sports bra,"This is the most comfortable sports bra I have worn, yet it is also very functional. I wear it for running and find it minimises bouncing very effectively while not being at all constricting. The velcro adjustable straps threw me off a little at first, but I like them so much more than the slide adjusting straps. Once you have got them at the length you want, they stay! The reasons I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 are minor (and more to do with my way of rating things). The material is quite thick. I do not find it hot, but the bra is very noticeable underneath of what you are wearing. I don't really care about this when I work out, but other people may."
4,satisfied,"Style had been recommended as a nursing sports bra b/c of the strap style that fastened in front, allowing you to pull the front ""cups"" down, similar to a nursing bra. While the strap style allowed for nice custom fit, I found it cumbersome to use on a regular basis for nursing, and just went with lifting the sports bra from the bottom. But strictly as a sports bra for a DD size, I think it's pretty good. Very comfortable, decent support. I don't know if a bra exists that provides the kind of support I'm looking for!"
3,Sports Bra?,"This is a very comfortable bra and I love the straps, but I would not consider it a sports bra. To me, you don't want any movement at all (or minimum) with a sports bra. I bought this because of the great reviews, but I will be sticking with my Champion until I find something better."
4,excellent support,"When i first got this i thought there was no way it would keep the girls under control. However i was pleasantly surprised. Excellent support even through the most high impact workouts. Only reason i didn't give it 5 stars was it does give you a little of the uni-boob syndrome so i usually just wear it around the neighborhood, home workouts."
5,Very Happy with Quality and Support,Its hard to find a good supportive sports bra that doesn't feel like I'm totally restricted. This does the job. It is comfortable yet very supportive. It also is easier to get on than over the head sports bras. I am very happy with this purchase. I used this bra for running and it definitely works and is definitely well worth it and is a great price!
4,I REALLY like this bra...,"Cute bra with a good, snug fit. I worry a little about the velcro on the adjustable straps eventually wearing out...but only a little. All in all, a GREAT bra for the price!"
2,"Not bad, but not good","I was fairly disappointed with this bra. The materials are good quality and construction is clean (no weak seams, loose threads), but bounce control wasn't optimal and some of its ""features"" actually hurt a bit. I usually use two fairly cheap compression sports bras and can achieve minimal movement with them. This bra felt like 1.5 of those bras and cost about 2x more. The straps are looped through a slit at the top edge of the front of the bra and are secured by Velcro. You adjust them by unlatching them, pulling them tighter, and reattaching to the Velcro strip. This system is far inferior to the normal sliding adjustment most bras have. The straps dig into my skin at the point of attachment, and by the end of a workout those two spots on my chest are really sore.Pros:Good materialsGood constructionCons:Straps hurtStrap adjustment system is badBounce control is just so-so given the price"
3,Not as good as the reviews stated...,"I bought this one and the Moving Comfort Maia bra. The other one is far superior to this one. First, I wear a 32DD and it feels really tight around the bra line, which is odd because all my other bras of that size fit fine - including the other Moving Comfort one. Second, the straps on this fall off my shoulders regularly, even after I've tighted them. I have small shoulders, so it happens with regular bras, but this is not good for a sports bra. Finally, this bra gives me clevage. When I'm working out, that is the last thing that I want to show off. Although my boobs do not move at all during the workout, based on the other reasons, I would buy the Maia over the Fiona anyday."
4,No Bounce!,"I gain and lose weight regularly so it's extremely difficult for me to find bras that fit for more than a few weeks at a time. This style is quite flexible. With adjustments to the straps and the three rows of hooks, I jumped from a 36D down to a 34C. I like the smooth surface under T-shirts. My only complaint is the corduroy-like ribbing around the rib cage. I wish it were smoother."
2,Not true to size,"Bought this sports bra in a 32D based on reviews that said it is ""true to VS sizes"", but I did not find this to be true. My VS size is 32D, but the cup size on this bra is huge. I plan on returning it, but I'm debating going down to a B or C cup size (it's really that big). Chest size fits perfect though. I do love that it functions like a regular bra with the back closure since I do the ""sports bra hop"" to get out of my other MC bras. I just can't give it a better rating because I can't wear it in the size I got."
5,Great deal,It offers comfort and high impact support for larger sizes without a lot of fuss with wires. I use it for horseback and it is all that I need.
4,Great bra for larger busted women trying to do serious cardio,"I love the infinite adjustability of this well-constructed sports bra- it washes up well, and is pretty durable, and dries quickly (I recommend hanging it). My only complaint is that the band under the chest needs to be wider or more ridgid, as it tends to bunch up or fold in half. This vendor has a very high price for this bra, as I normally pay far less at Eastern Mountain Sports. I wouldn't buy from this vendor again, but this is my third Fiona Bra and I do think it's the best sports bra out there"
2,not true to size,"not the same fit as others of the same brand, model purchased the same size. Factory defect? You tell me. ran larger than normal"
3,great support,This Bra fits true to size & provides great support for running. I would not recommend it for large chested people because it will give you the dreaded uni boob!
4,Great bra for the big chested!!,"I recently started running on a treadmill and was in need of a supportaive sports bra. I am a 42D and have never had luck finding something that held the suckers down, until I found this one! I love the adjustable straps and it holds them in place so I can run without having to hold the ladies down with my arms!! So glad I found this!!"
1,Size,"It was small in & tight u would need almost 2 sizes bigger,I'm a 38c but this was no way close,"
3,Uniboob,"I ordered this nicely made bra after reading the reviews. I agree it was good quality, but I had to return it because it was too small. I ordered a different product and love it. It separates and lifts the breasts. I did order one size up since it appears that what you have to do with the sports bras."
5,Great for nursing mamas who love intense workouts,"My daughter is 9 months and I have been nursing her the whole time and plan to go for about a year. I started working out 6 weeks after she was born. I do a lot of plyo, HIIT workouts and running so need a lot of support. So this whole time been on the hunt for sports bra with great support but would be easy to nurse in if I had to. I finally found one this is great price, great support and with the velcro straps easy to nurse her if necessary."
5,Best Sports Bra So Far...,"Since there like as not will never be a perfect sports bra for those of us that were built with a smaller ribcage and larger...ahem...chests, this one comes close. The velcro straps are comfortable and it's nice to be able to adjust them depending on what kind of a workout I am doing. Same thing with the band. If I'm doing higher impact, I just tighten the band and I feel well supported. I thought if anything, the cup size ran a little small, but that may just be me. I generally wear larger than a D, but I was able to fit most all of me in there! I also think it's more comfortable than a racer back."
5,Love it!,"This is a great bra for the price! I need a lot of support for high impact workouts and this bra really comes through. I love that it has a wire to give me some shape, and it's adjustable."
3,Sports Bra,The bottom rolls up a bit and makes it uncomfortable. I bought a better one in Kohl's made by Champion.
2,No molded cups,"I love this bra, it's made extremely well and i was excited to find it in my small band but semi-large cup size. But I returned it, bcuz the only reason I chose this bra was because the description said it had molded cups. It doesn't. I tried it on and had MAJOR ""poke thru"" and that's just not cute. I'd never leave the house like that so Unfortunately I returned it. had it had molded cups (like the description said it did), I would hve kept it and it would hve been easily a 4 star, maybe 5."
1,Disappointed!,"If you are larger in the bust area and do high impact aerobics, this bra is not for you! It doesn't look good either. It does not create a separation between your bust. I thought I had finally found a good sports bra, and once I received it in the mail and tried it one, I was so disappointed."
3,Elastic band too tight,"I'm 5'7"", 140, B cup, and like 20% bodyfat. I wear a small/medium everything. I bought this in a medium, and the elastic band is so tight it makes breathing while I am running even more difficult. For me, it seems like Moving Comfort has a very, very tight band on the bottom of all their bras.When in doubt, go a size bigger."
2,everyone knows how cold you are!,"this sports bra has okay support, however there is nothing to cover up how cold you are... The adjustable sraps are weird, I guess you could get use to it, but the straps are secured with velcro which if I remember correctly from the 80's does not last very long."
4,Glad I purchased,"I wasnt sure about this bra when I opened the pack - I am used to underwire or at least moulded cups, and being a larger than average size, was concerned I woudlnt get the support I needed for running. However this bra really does give a LOT of support for the C/DD (and probably higher) sizes, unlike normal bras.There is no padding or wire, its very flexible. I think the best bit is you can adjust the bra straps FROM THE FRONT (THANK YOU whoever added this feature)It also flattens you out a bit, which I like as I dont like having people watch the girls bouncing as I jog.I never thought a crop top style bra could work this well and I am considering buying a few more (if only they came in flesh tone colour)"
4,Noticeable Improvement!,"Switching to this bra made my runs much more comfortable! It's not perfect, I still feel like there are better bras out there. For the price though, it is fantastic!"
2,not comfortable for me,"I found immediately after putting it on that the adjustment velcro on each strap was very uncomfortable. They are located in the front of the bra, and felt like two big bulges pushing in underneath each side of my collarbone. I have heard great things about MovingComfort, so I don't think it means their other bras are unpleasant. I just found out that this one wouldn't work for me."
2,Runs big,"I bought this in my normal size 38D but it is too big. I will keep it anyway because I don't want to hassle with an online return/exchange when I am not sure what my correct size should be in this bra. I have to wear this on the last set of hooks and put the straps up as high as they will go, then it is okay for strength training and low impact cardio, but the fit is still too loose to support high impact activities. The other thing I don't like is that the material is very slippery, so it is hard to fasten the hooks. On a positive note, the colors are beautiful. I got the mojito, which is a nice bright green. A lot of sites only offer basic black or white, so you may need to shop around to find the pretty colors."
3,this bra ain't perfect -- but it stabilizes comfortably,"This was my first Moving Comfort purchase, and probably the most I'd ever spent on a sports bra. Was it worth the price? Overall, yes. It's a soft generally well-designed bra -- I like the inventive velcro on the ends of the straps. The wider area of four rows of hooks in the back and the width and padding on the shoulder straps avoid digs into the skin. Same goes for under the arm area. There are two drawbacks to this bra that could be easily remedied. The primary problem is with the ribbed band that runs the bottom length of the bra -- the band itself is good, but it needs to be anchored to the fabric behind it -- to the front of the bra. I find this part riding up under my breasts a great deal, but I've yet to find a bra that doesn't do that. The other issue is just a by-product of stabilization: the great 'uni-boob'. Is there a way to help with separation? this problem has caused a heat rash to develop between my breasts."
1,Don't waste your money,"I usually don't take the time to write reviews, but I don't want anyone else who is looking for a supportive sports bra to waste there money. This bra offers no support at all! I bought this bra for my daily walks hoping it would offer me average support. All I can say is that It offers NO support at all. I can say that It is comfortable, that is if your looking for a bra to wear while sitting on the couch. However if you actually need support because your active, KEEP on looking this is NOT the bra you want. People who gave this bra positive reviews must have implants or have never had children ."
3,Not a lot of bounce,"I love the color of this sporty bra. I got it because I hate pulling sweaty sports bras over my head after a good run. It provides a lot of support and compression, but It also is smaller than what it states. I am a 36C and usually wear my bra on the tightest setting, but with this bra I have to be on the last set of hooks. Also, the cups seem to be smaller than a standard C. Just a heads up to anyone who is on the larger end of your cup size.The only thing I hate about this bra is that the band that runs under your breasts rolls up. It isn't wide enough to hold itself in place and/or the smaller sizing on everything else throws that out of whack. I hate this so much that I considered sending the bra back after I had worn it once."
3,Rolling Along,"I usually am very satisfied with Moving Comfort bras. This is the first time I have ever tried the Fiona model. It was great compression-style support, but I could not get the bottom band to lay flat in the back -- even when I first put it on and hadn't moved around yet. It was very obvious because I got the bronze color and the lining is white. It showed under my shirt and was uncomfortable as well. I would not purchase again."
3,Just OK,"This bra is great for low - moderate impact workouts. It in NO WAY stops bounce! However, now I can just wear ONE bra for easy workouts instead of 2, and they come in cute colors and a wide range of sizes."
3,A little disappointing. :(,"This is my second Moving Comfort bra. The first one I bought about 3 weeks after my daughter was born. At the time I was a 36D and purchased the Juno style bra. It was awesome.. until I finally settled into a size 34DDD. Ugh. So, this Juno bra became too loose around the band, which is where most the support in a bra comes from. Although I LOVED this bra, I couldnt find it on Amazon and decided to go with the Fiona because of the rave reviews. Unfortunately, it didnt hold up to the expectations I had. The band and straps hold alot of support, but the overall bra part was just like any other Champion sports bra. It seems to be just spandex and not much for support. Also-- it doesnt have alot of padding and you can see nipples-- my pet peeve! No one needs to see your nipples when you workout! ha. Anyway-- I will go back to buying the Juno bra in my correct size next. I am a marathon runner and need all the support I can get. I now use the Fiona for yard work."
1,'Nipple Show',"To start off, I returned the Moving Comfort Fiona Bra. The material is very thin (2 layers thin). Fiona has absolutely NO nipple coverage. There are no 'cups' in this sports bra. Secondly, yes it does have adjustable straps, but they are velcro and fasten under the straps. I like to do a mix of excercises, but mostly cardio. I tried doing jumping jacks with this sports bra on. It offerd moderate support, the ladies did some bouncing. I didn't feel like there was enough lift or support for high impact activity. I am a 36-38C and ordered a 38C. It had an ok fit. Not too tight, but not too loose either.(That is with it fastened as tight as it would go.) If I were going to keep it, I think a 36C would fit better. Overall, it is fine if you don't mind nipple show, a few bounces, and the velcro straps. If you want compression and minimal bounce, take a pass."
2,Not true to size,"Seemed well built, but not true to size order bigger than you are. cup size OK but around smaller than regular bras."
1,Bra review,This style/make of bra is not for a full figured woman. There was no support at all for a 44D/DD size. Needs more padding/support.
2,Great color but not as described..,No molded cups.. so this can not be a high impact support bra.. it's ugly w/ o cups..color is as shown..
2,Fit small & no padding,"I read that this bra fit small but I didn't really expect it to be as small as it was. I wear a 34C on the loosest hook so I ordered a 34C and when I recieved it, I was disappointed to find that it didn't fit well at all. I could do it up but it wasn't comfortable. Reading other reviews, I thought it would have more padding then it did. Even though my boobs were pancaked, due to the fact the bra was too small, the bra still showed headlights. The adjustable straps is a great feature but I don't think I'll be ordering this bra again in a different size."
2,Too constricting for me,"For me, this was way too tight. I've never had a 40D bra be this tight. I'm all for support but this was just constricting and uncomfortable and so I'll send it back. I'm really disappointed because if it were just a tad bigger in the band I would have kept it. I'm not quite sure how this can be considered a size 40."
5,BEST sports bra ever!,"This is the best sports bra I've ever owned. I now have two, color watermelon and black. The fit is perfect and it holds everything still so that no matter what level of exercise you are doing, there is no movement. The style is also very attractive so you could wear them alone without a top over it. I own other sports bras that are considered higher end but they don't even come close to this one."
2,Very disappointed,"I bought this bra after reading all the great reviews and have to say I am very disappointed. The bra is very well made and fits comfortably, although you have to take care to get the velcro on the straps lined up perfectly to prevent it digging into your shoulders. If I was just wearing it for walking it would be fine, but I wore it to a Zumba class and it was anything but okay. First of all, I was bouncing all over the place. The worst part though was that when I took it off after the class, I had never seen such a wet bra. So much for the wicking material. Even my old compression bras keep me drier. In short, not for high impact and not for women who sweat when they work out."
5,fiona fits!,"I won't put a video of me wearing the fiona bra with less bounce, but it's pretty great. The straps are easily adjustable and the texture is silky so it doesn't cling to your tee shirts. I own several, and love them. Its not a bounce-proof, but a significantly bounce-less bra for horseback riding, skiing, and every day wear."
3,ok for larger sizes,"bought the white in 40dd and it holds them in place well. Its tight, but i guess its suppose to be, doesnt offer any separation at all but then again its a sports bra. Its better than most ive tried for larger women, the only part i really dont like is the bottom band rolls up."
4,a great bra but could be better,This gives so much support without putting too much pressure on my neck and back. Wish it has a little bit more padding. I was running a half marathon in a chilly morning and my nipples showed even with the bra and a long sleeve shirt...awkward.....
4,Great purchase,"Very happy with purchase. Nice to have a sport bra with a little support when you're smaller chested, one that doesn't make you look totally flat. Although it says seamless, it does have seams but not right down the middle front, kind of on the sides, but not a problem for the other benefits. Very comfortable."
4,"Great support, watch the sizing","This is an excellent bra for high-impact activities, even for the well-endowed. But watch the sizing carefully. If you want as little bounce as possible, you may need to go down a size in the band and/or the cup. I did both, so I wear a 34D in regular bras but a 32C in Moving Comfort sports bras. This gives compression and support for things like jumping jacks, jump rope, running, etc. My favorite feature is the velcro where the shoulder straps meet the bra. Excellent for adjusting!!!"
5,Pleasantly surpised!,This is a very good bra for jogging because everything stays in place while moving. The Fiona sports bra is also comfortable enough to wear while lounging around the house or sleeping. I was a little surprised that the support is so good because the front of this bra uses velcro to adjust it the shoulder area.The design is so good that I wound up purchasing 3 more.Just remember to to fasten the hooks when washing with laundry. Sometimes I forget to do this and on occasion the hook got stuck in the dryer or another article of clothing.
4,Great support!,It is a great bra and provides great support for running. I am very happy with this product
2,Not the same Fiona Bra that it used to be,Two years ago I bought this bra for my grand daughter who plays volleyball and she loved it because it gave her good support and no bounce (38DD). The new lining isn't as good as it once was and therefore she wanted me to return it and look for a bra with more support. I am disappointed with the changes to a once great sports bra.
1,Waste of Money,"There is nothing good about this bra. It doesn't move, true. It flattens, true. Does it do that well?NO!!! To use a common metaphor, the headlights are still on and visible. If it worked for others, I'm glad. Me? No! Wished I had returned it."
2,Heather's Review,"I would not recommend this sports bra. After trying the Maia and Juno, I was very disappointed in this sports bra. The straps are kind of bulky and didn't line up very well. I did not find this sports bra to be very supportive and it seemed awkward to adjust."
2,disappointed,"Mia bra has so much more support. Didn't realize this one did not have underwire. Gives you a uni-boob. Thought I'd try it to see if this was any cooler but it isn't. Would not recommend this for any high impact aerobics. Mia does not let you move an inch & keeps you from having uni-boob. Wish they would come up with a seamless version, though. But, this is better than a regular bra for sports & it does hook in the back. One thing to be careful, though, is the velcro strap adjustments. Get them precise or the velcro will rub your arm pit area."
4,I like the uniboob,"It keeps me out of the net playing volleyball. I've had the misfortune to only be able to find it a full cup size smaller than what I should wear. Talk about compression, no, I repeat no bounce at that size. I'm going to try one that's the right size next and it probably won't work as well. But, at least I will be able to breathe.I both love and hate the straps. They're thick and supportive with a wrap-around velcro strap that is adjustable. Occasionally, the velcro comes undone after a long rally.. it's totally fun to fix that wardrobe malfunction on the court in front of everyone. ""Wardrobe time-out, anyone else?"" The straps stick out like a sore thumb on a tank top, but if you're like most, you'll sacrifice for a bra that really does the job.The other thing I don't like is the seam that runs down the sides of each of the cups. They show through a tighter t-shirt! That said, please don't discontinue the bra. I can't live without it."
3,not too well-designed,"The sizes of these bras run a bit small. The seams can scratch your skin slightly. My main complaint is that the inner bottom band curls up and over the bottom of the front of the bra from underneath, so you're frequently tucking it back under. This could have been avoided it they'd just stitched it together better."
5,Great for nursing mom's!,"I love the support and comfort of this bra. Also, very convenient for nursing moms as the straps are Velcro. I will continue to use this bra after I'm done breast feeding my daughter as well."
4,"Great, supportive sports bra AND you can nurse in it!","This bra is awesome! It fits great and holds me in well for circuit training, strength training and cardio. It doesn't hold me in quite as well as the Maia for running, but I am still very happy with the support. I bought it one cup size smaller than I normally wear because I really wanted support. I have a 9 month old and I am able to nurse her in this bra if we have to run errands after the gym. The adjustable straps are awesome! The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I still bounce a little bit when running and jumping. I would definitely reccommend this to anyone that needs support, but doesn't want as much restriction as the Maia. This was my first Moving Comfort purchase and I now own 3 of their sports bras. I go to the gym 3-5 times a week and am training for a 1/2 marathon. I don't think I will ever buy a different brand of sports bra now that I have discovered Moving Comfort!"
4,Comfortable support,"I wear this bra to run in and am very pleased with it. The ""girls"" enjoy comfortable support and I don't feel like I'm being constricted. The back clasp can be a little frustrating, so I've solved this by just clasping the bra in front of me, then sliding it 'round back before slipping my arms thru the straps--less of a wrestling match than doing a behind-the-back hook-up."
3,"Comfortable, but not enough support for larger cups","I was excited to try this bra based on all the great reviews, but am disappointed with it. While it does run true to size and is very comfortable, it definitely is not a high impact bra if you are a larger cup size. I'm a 32D, and the first time I wore it to do a high-impact workout, I had to go change into a different bra since I was bouncing all over the place.Since this is labeled as a ""High Impact"" bra, I am giving this three stars.The Moving Comfort Juno bra is more expensive, but that one is a true high-impact bra for larger cup sizes. I love that bra, and will most likely pick up a few more."
2,it's ok,"At first I really liked the bra, it definitely holds my DDs in place, but it puts SO much pain and pressure on my shoulders. I only wear it in moments of desperation now :("
5,The best sports bra for the larger sized runner,I have gotten 5 of these sports bras and love them all. I finally went a size up to (C-D) to criss cross the straps in the back (adjustable velco on front of bra straps) so I can wear them also with my racer back running shirts and this makes the fit very snug but comfortable. I have chafed a little on the longer runs (5-10 miles) under the lower bra band in the front when I criss cross the straps in the back but apply a little sports glide on my skin before the run and problem solved! The Fiona Sports Bra in my opinion is one of the best made support sports bras on the market that is both comfortable and well constructed to last. Almost a complete no bounce bra with soft and wide straps that don't dig in or pinch and moisture whisking is excellent even on long runs!
4,It's a decent sports bra....,"As a 36 DD, I was thrilled to see that there was a high impact sports bra out there for big chested women that had great reviews and I bought it hoping that this would be the bra to stop my chest from bouncing everywhere. While the bra does support me, I wouldn't say it is the most supportive. For me, this bra would be great for low impact exercise (like yoga, pilates, etc), because it keeps me in place. But I would not recommend this bra for high impact exercise unless you wear another bra with it. I ordered the Maia as well and when I put it on top of the Fiona, the support was perfect and there was minimal bouncing. So overall, I would say that this is still a decent sports bra because of the price (much more affordable vs. the Enell), its comfortable and the bra runs true to size, but I wouldn't count on this bra to be a high impact one if you are big chested."
4,ALMOST...the PERFECT bra!,I absolutely LOVE this BRA! I have a fairly large chest for my size and I have recently gotten into running. I noticed that it was hurting my back and the other bras were so hard to get on and off that it made it difficult when I was running relays to change them. This bra still gives me the same support but without the headache of getting it on and off! I would give it five stars but I don't like how the holes around the straps are not really reinforced with strong stitching or something to make them a little stronger so I do worry that with the amount i use this how long it will be able to hold up...but it has been over a month...almost two of every other day use and is still doing well...we shall see!
2,Not enough support,"Bra fit well, but it didn't provide enough support. When I tried it on, there was as much bounce as if I were wearing a regular bra--not a sports bra. I would not recommend this bra for high or even medium impact sports."
2,"Good brand, bad design, total uniboob","I own two Maia's by Moving Comfort so I tried this one out when I found it on sale. It doesn't have underwire, I had total uniboob. The band at the bottom wouldn't stay put, it kept rolling up a bit. I bought a 38C, the same as I wear in the Maia, but the weird uniboob look is just too unflattering. I may try wearing a regular bra underneath, but I never do that with the Maia. I wouldn't wear it unless my other two aren't clean."
5,Support Support Support,"This is my favorite sport bra. The way it is made is genius - the adjustable straps loop thru the bra instead of plastic clips. Plastic tends to wear out and break, but this bra does not. Love the colors too. The best support for high impact workouts. Awesome price!!!"
5,Great sports bra that gives all the support you need,It was difficult to find a bra that would provide the support I needed for running. Although I don't run more than 6 miles all the other sports bras I found still allowed movement which I found terribly uncomfortable. The fiona has no underwire and is super comfortable and keeps everything in its place. I'm definitely buying more.
1,Expensive uni-boob,"My Moving Comfort Cara works beautifully for yoga, running, and backpacking. When I tried to order another Cara, the seller sent a Fiona instead. I tried it out to be fair. Unfortunately, it felt like a grudge against my breasts: choking them like some $5 sports bra. I am young, have never had kids, wear a 32dd; yet this bra made me ""look like a flat-chested grandma"" - a friend's description. Harsh but accurate."
2,"so,so","I can't see how this bra is any better than much less expensive ones that pull on over your head, in fact,not as good. I stiil had the same old uni-boob problem and they're still bouncy, only more in tandem. It didn't seem as secure as the pull-on types. I ordered a Glamorise Sports bra at the same time which is bulit more like a regular bra, only with enhanced structural details. It was much more secure, very minimal bouncing, and without uni-boob."
1,Uncomfortable,"I bought this based on past reviews but am disappointed. It is extremely difficult to get on and off. I read earlier reviews commenting on this but thought how hard could a bra be? Well, it is difficult to fasten once on and even harder when you are sweaty. It also cuts into my arm pit on my left side. I have never spent this much money on a sports bra and regret doing so."
4,Awesome Bra and fits great,This bra feel great and fits great. Perfect for any activity and does not slide or chaff. I will buy more for sure!!!
4,Good road Atlas at a fair price - it does the job.,"Country maps on double page spread of US, Canada and Mexico. Each state/province covered on double page spread. A few cities are also shown in detail, but only sufficent if you intend to drive thought the city, not to find your way locally. All distances in Canada shown in kilometers, with a conversion chart to miles being provided at the front of the Atlas."
1,I hate this book.,"I am five. (This is typed by my mom.) I do not think this book is for me. No! No! No! It's terrible because they tie a snake's tail in a knot. And, an elephant tromps on his tail. And, I hate it because snakes are my favorite animals. It's not nice. Pythons don't eat leopards or pelicans. Someone read it out loud today at school. I think it was very terrible to choose such a horrid book. Don't buy it!"
4,A good book that teaches the importance of honesty,This is a really fun book that my mom read me as a child. It has good pictures and the words are not hard for a child to understand. I would recommend this as the perfect book for parents and kids wo like good bedtime stories.
2,Yawn,It probably reads better in print. The audio has a juvenile intonation. Not recommended for in- car use if you tend to fall asleep at the wheel.
2,should have been a series of articles in the New Yorker,This material would have been perfect as a series of four very interesting articles in the New Yorker. Unfortunately it was combined (under a theme that was a bit of a stretch) and over-expanded to fill the pages of this book.
3,Strange,"This book is well written but a bit strange. Mr. Pollen bases his premise that plants manipulate mankind into shaping their future because of man's 4 desires. My son had to read it for college, so I picked it up. It is quite a ""green"" book with lots of progressive ideas."
1,"Great Idea, Horrible Result","Mr Pollan had a great idea for a book--evolution of 4 different species of well know plants from the plant's perspective as influenced by humans. There's about 30 pages of good information to this end. The rest is horribly long and painful unrelated tangents that he clearly enjoys writing about, but have absolutely nothing to do with the subject. For instance, in covering apples he talks for freggen ever about John Chapaman, aka Johnny Appleseed. Who cares about Appleseed's sexual frustrations with a potential 10 year old bride??? Who cares about his love of sleeping in hollowed out logs, or on the snow if sleeping in the log would disturb some insects??? If you're ridiculously bored and don't mind reading about random garbage you might like this book. If you're looking for enlightenment on this subject or like a well executed book, don't even think about this one."
4,Enjoyable Read,"I read this book over a weekend, and found it thoroughly enjoyable. The author does have a distinctive style, chatty with a tendency to go off on tangents. Not to everyones taste but I liked it.Some reviewers have noted that the science could be more rigorous. That is what pubmed is for, this is pop-science, written by a journalist, and one is of the better offerings within the genre."
3,The sections about cannabis and the potato are best,"Pollan writes about the co-evolution of plants and humans. We think we may be manipulating plants by breeding and selecting for certain traits, but Pollan tries to make the point that these traits that so please humans are part of a very clever evolutionary strategy. Pollan looks at four plants: the apple, the tulip, marijuana, and the potato. The sections about cannabis and the potato are best, as there is some interesting discussion about the nature of consciousness-altering chemicals and genetic engineering, respectively. In fact, the potato section is a nice companion to Fast Food Nation by Eric Schlosser. Unfortunately, Pollan neither makes convincing arguments nor reveals anything extraordinary about our relationship with these plants. Too often, he digresses with philosophical talk about the difference between the worship of Dionysus and Apollo. If you're wondering what that has to do with plants, that's my point."
5,Fascinating reading,"I have had this book since 2003 and loaned or recommended it to all my friends. It is a great story that I zipped right though.Pollan's writing is informative and pleasurable. Second Nature & Botany of Desire provide an interesting perspective on our relationship with other living things in the garden and larger natural world. His insightful observations about nature and biology will ring true for many, especially organic gardeners."
5,New Perspectives,"This is a thought-provoking book that you'll want on your reference shelf so you can refer to it again and again. I guarantee that after you read this book you'll see every successful plant (or animal) in a new light. You'll understand why there are more dogs than wolves on the planet. When your dog gets you to fondle its ears because they are so irrisistably soft, or you can't resist the sweet taste of a ripe strawberry, you'll remember the book's lessons about tulips, apples, marijuana and potatoes . . . and you'll wonder if you are being manipulated by your dog, or those red strawberries."
3,Readable copy and interesting hypothesis.,A long book on botany if you are up to it. For a more compact and lively study try The Story of the Apple.
4,Fascinating perspective on plants and people,"Michael Pollan has written a terrific four-part look at the relationship of plants and people. He examines four human desires - sweetness, beauty, intoxication and control - and plants that have satisfied those desires - the apple, the tulip, cannabis and the potato. He includes philosophy and history, retraces Johnny Appleseed's route, and has a frightening tour of commercial potato fields in Idaho (you may never eat another french fry after you read this section!) All in all, a fascinating and educational look at the relationship of people and plants."
5,A fascinating discussion of the relationship between plants & humans,Any fans of Henry Hobhouse'sSeeds of Change: Six Plants That Transformed MankindandSeeds of Wealth: Five Plants That Made Men Richwill enjoy this book. His conversational writing style and inclusion of interesting anecdotes reminded me of John Mc Phee'sOranges.
3,Not Bad,"I didn't get drawn in like I did his other two books, but I learned a lot. That's what I can count on with Pollan."
5,a desirable book,for the sensuous gardner. A wonderful book; well written & well resaearched. Informally informative. beautiful.
2,What's all the hype?,"This book needed severe editing to remove redundancies. His point of view is eye-opening, and could have made a fascinating article in The New Yorker magazine. Time and again in each chapter, the author repeats the same anecdotes and snippets of information. His editor should be ashamed. I am irritated to have wasted time and money on this book."
3,Interesting but flawed,"I found this book interesting but it had some notable flaws. In some places his background research was poor. When he talks about cold blood dinosaurs (they weren't) and that sugar hypes you up (it doesn't) I wondered what else he had wrong. I also found that his writing was colored as what I perceive as his political perspective of the world. What was most disappointing though was that he never answered his central question, how plants had used humans to make themselves more successful. He talks around it some but most of his book is how humans modify plants for their own use. Still, if you keep the faults in mind it is still interesting. The section on the apple appealed to me the most."
2,Nuggets of information buried in an avalanche of opinion,"Michael Pollan had a great idea, but the finished product just does not live up to its promotion. Much of this book is filler material. He takes four plants and gives different historical perspectives on them, some more successfully than others. Perhaps the least interesting for me was the chapter on Tulips. The most interesting was his final piece on the potato.Would I buy the book again? No. Would I recommend it?Only if you are prepared to be bored by about half the material."
2,Too much information,"Started out liking the chapter on Apples, less the next and so on. It seemed like I was getting the same story in each chapter only more elaborate and wordy."
3,THRIFT STORE QUALITY,"Its your basic perfesser lecture with some interesting anecdotes, that is, navel gazing. I'm donating my copy to the Saint Pia Zadora Thrift Store."
4,The Botany of Desire,"WOW! much more information than I ever thought I wanted to know. Just when I thought I had it figured out BAM there was so much more to hear. Certainly not a fast read, just jammed pack with info."
5,Love Michael Pollen,"I saw Michael Pollen at a seminar at Tech and have read ""In Defense of Food"". His books bring a very different point of view to the way we should look at food. However, Living in Texas, I am surrounded by many closed minded people and unlike the mass consensus here, you don't have to be a democrat to look at food in a more constructive way. He doesn't tell you how to eat or what to eat, just gives his point of view."
4,Good backround,"I read this after reading ""The Omnivore's Dilemina"".It's good. The tulip frenzy has been in the news lately and this has an interesting write up about that.I also really enjoyed the write-up about apples! That's a bit of American History I didn't know about. I think it's a good read for someone interested in food."
4,A Treat.,"Michael Pollan's writing style is unusual, but engaging in a chatty, ""round the table"" type way. The content is broad and diverse. Pollan is comfortable going lateral, deviating readily to highlight some unusual aspects of the material being explored, and just as readily leading the reader on, to consider other interesting dynamics and perspectives.I would encourage anyone interested in the Biology / Ecology type areas, and teachers in particular, to consider this book. I believe it definitely encourages one to consider fresh perspectives on (and a greater respect for) the interactions between mankind and our plant world.(It is a book that I have already added to the ""Must Read"" list for my Gifted & Talented students at High School.)"
4,"Short, Sweet, Insightful","I was continuously amused and enlightened about many things in this book; suffice it to say I dog-eared quite a few pages as I wanted to go back to re-read certain passages for the perspective, perhaps for the phrasing, or for the knowledge.Humans certainly have the desire and the ability to bend nature, but a good lesson learned in this book is to let nature be itself, even as you make it do your bidding!"
3,Science Lite - Rambling with a few gems,Michael Pollan's The Botony of Desire has both strengths and weakenesses which is why I gave it a score of 3 stars. The strenghts include the story of Johnny Appleseed and the use of apples for cider prior to the use of apples for eating. The history of the apple in Asia was very good. The strengths also include the story of the Irish potato famine and the perils of monoculture. The weaknesses include a rambling lazy style that might be great for a relaxed vacation reading experience but is annoying if you wish Pollan to get to his point and move forward.
2,Not very informative,The book's research is rather questionable. Too simple. Too limited in sources. Too much of the author's own idea or guess work. If you read it as a story book then it is not too bad.
4,Good Pop Science,"Although this book deals with come scientific issues, it does so in a very accesible manner. The basic topics presented are how and why certain plants have been domesticated by man. The twist is that the why covers not only the why from the human point of view, but also that of the plants. As the book points out, not all plants are willing to be domesticated (the common example for this is the oak tree), but those that are have generally enjoyed an abundance unknown by other plants.Four case studies are presented, with each of them illustrating a different reason for man's domestication of plant species, and a particular species that represents this desire. I found the first (Desire: Sweetness;Species: Apple) and last (Desire:Control;Species: Potato) to be the most interesting in the book. The last one in particular raises some important issues and tough questions regarding genetically modified food."
4,"Witty, Engaging, Educational","THE BOTANY OF DESIRE has a nice mixture of science and history regarding the four plants under discussion: The apple, the tulip, marijuana, and the potato. Pollan is an informative writer with a beguiling writing style that often had me chuckling to myself. One of the reviewers wrote that there was too much 'personal' stuff in the book, but I don't agree. The personal information is a big part of what makes his writing so engaging."
2,"Interesting Ideas, Boring Read","The Botany of Desire presents an innovative way to think about how plants have propagated. The ideas are fresh, but, unfortunately, too few for an entire book. This subject matter would have been better served in essay format. The history presented about the tulip, rose and potato is fun and interesting--worth the read in these parts, even though one has to wade through the interspersed philosophical musings of the author that are reiterated one too many times in (dare I say it?) overly-flowery language. The self-deprecating, blushing tales of pot smoking experimentation were silly and not worth the time to read. Honestly, I cannot recommend this book unless you want to be bored most of the time while reading it."
1,Poor.,"I expected good things from this book, and I gave it the benefit of the doubt. But Pollan's argument isn't new, and it isn't persuasive. Most of it seems like a contrived effort to come up with a book. I think I could forgive even that if it were more entertainingly written. Would I buy this book again? No."
1,It fell short of my expectations.,"Pollan's prose was simply dull and his points were predictable. On the whole I found that the book lacked originality. Would I buy the book again? To be perfectly honest, no, it came up short of my expectations."
2,This book personifies plants and makes all kinds of false statements,"Plants don't make an evolutionary decision to throw their lot in with humans. Evolution is about the random mutations that occur and the survival of the fittest. This tries to pass itself off as science but what it really does is mislead people into believing that the result was planned.True that it does encourage you to see things from a different angle, but it doesn't make any valid points in the direction of how plants ""plan"" their future...."
5,Great Read,I can't stop telling people about this book. Entertaining. Educational. I bought the book a year ago and it sat in a stack I planned to get to...big mistake...looking forward to starting his current book and I hope he's writing his next one.
2,Style over Substance,"The writing style and amount of information in this book bring it down. That is unfortunate because the topics are and should be very interesting and easy to write about. As other reviewers have said, the author talks about 4 plant species: the apple, marijuana, the tulip, and the potato. The information on the does not run that deep - at times it seems like he did some Google searches and cobbled together the facts into a story written at a middle or high school level. To make matters worse, interspersed within the information on these topics Pollan has inserted many annoying personal thoughts. I eventually found myself identifying and skipping these paragraphs. It is as if he didn't think the plants themselves are interesting enough on their own."
5,botany of desire,"one of the best books i have read. o.k., there are many great books. still, this one is perfect and there is nothing like it. if you are remotely interested in plants, this is an excellent book to read. a fresh perspective on an ancient concept. i bought this particular copy as a gift for a friend. an incredible read. you haven't read it? read it. really."
3,Nature from a different perspective.,"An interesting, although not totally novel, perspective on the success of but four plants: apples, tulips, marijuana, and the potato, all of which hold a prominent place in our history. And all have an interesting story to tell, however, that story could have been told in much fewer words as Mr. Pollan's writing becomes a little tedious. Aside from that major fault I found much to learn here, about the individual plants, and their effect on our history. I admit though to be unconvinced with an allusion of conscious design provided the flora. I've noticed this consideration given by other authors, and wonder if it isn't it's own form of mania."
3,How Plants EvolveTo Make Themselves Attractive,"After reading the Omnivores Dilemma and In Defense of Food, I looked forward to reading this one. I knew it had been written earlier and was about the natural history of plants, but I enjoyed his other writings and found them insightful so I didn't much care what it was, I'm a Michael Pollan fan. So, this turned out to be a quirky look at the history of how the Apple developed in North America, how the potato evolved and impacted Ireland and is being genetically modified today, how pot has gotten stronger as a result of the war on drugs and how the tulip evolved. Fun, funny and engaging not unlike Simon Winchester. Though, while Winchester is the proper old Englishman stumbling across interesting topics, Pollan is a stoner speculating about how plants evolve to make themselves attractive to humans for cultivation."
4,A book remembered after all these years.,"As another reviewer said, this is a book remembered after many years. And to my regret I got rid of my copy many years ago. I liked the characters and the part where he doesn't changer her tire for her but tells her just how to do it is priceless.A good read."
4,Speed improved with Sony R1,"I have an Epson P-2000 photo viewer which does not accept Memory Stick Pro media even with the third party CF converter. In order to download photo files into the P-2000 directly, I need to use the CompactFlash instead of using the MemoryStick with my Sony DSC-R1 . The writing speed of using Kingston 100X 1G appears to be faster than using SanDisk Ultra II 2G CF (to flash the internal memory) but still much slower than using any memory stick Pros I have. Followings are the timing I recorded.For Raw/Fine mode, from shutter released to memory flushed, approx:SanDisk MS Pro 2G: 6.9 secSanDisk MS Pro 2G Ultra II: 5.6 secSony MS Pro 2G: 5.6 secSony MS Pro High Speed 512M: 6.4 sec (slower than normal Sony MS Pro, strangely)SanDisk CF 2G Ultra II: 10.3 secKingston 100X CF 1G: 8.2 sec(for fun only)original Sony MS 32M: 30.4 secAll of the above Medias were purchased from authorized dealers (B&H;, J&R;,[....]I would give it 5 stars if it matches the MS Pro's performance."
1,Junk,"This, so called, home theater system will work only with your DVD player and is not capable of being used while viewing your cable TV. After several hours (frustrating hours) trying to make this JUNK work I called the 800 number supplied. While everyone was courtious, and being transferred several times, I was told this was not TV capable. Why would anyone buy this?"
1,Cannot connect it to a TV,If you would like to watch only the DVD this is a good system. Be carefull it does not have a connector to the TV so you can't use it for watching the movies on your cable. The other disadvantage is that it can only work with the DVD player supplied with it.
2,Dissappointed,"I was under the impression this was a wireless surround sound sytem, The only wireless part of this was the back speaker."
2,Limited Use,"I ordered this product with high expectations. In addition to having a home theater for my DVDs I planned to run my television audio through the speakers. However, there is NO AUDIO IN jack with this product. Thus, moments after setting it up I had to repack it and ship it back to Amazon.I also thought 'wireless' to mean 'wireless' and that description influenced my purchase. However, only the rear speaker is actually wireless.Lastly, one week ago the product was USD199.94. That is what I paid. Now I see it is USD20 cheaper. If you are really keen to have this limited system, wait a while. Maybe the price wil keep dropping.Also, I paid USD199.94, and I see that today is"
2,not happy,"You get what you pay for.... more or less. The sound quality is very bad. The speakers are what you'd expect $5 speakers to sound like. 500 watts is an total misnomer. Its more like 15W-20W or about what you'd expect out of a $30 boom box. When playing a cd or dvd, there's no display on the front to know what track you're on. It only displays ""DVD/CD"" or FM/AM station. The rear wireless speaker has a constant buzz. when you turn it on or off there is a loud ""crack/thump"" as the amplifier turns itself on. Its very light, and seems very cheap. Everything from the cables to the speakers are the cheapest you can possibly get.What's good: ease of setup (everything is color coded). The video part of a movie is good. Having 5 sources of sound in a room is nice.Overall, I'm torn. I'm not sure if I should return it, or keep it and buy a few nicer speakers for the front 3 channels.BTW: If you are going to buy it, please, please don't pay more than $100 for this. look around."
3,A bit wordy,"I needed this book to get through the game but there is so much to read...I had to up the time on my screen saver between moves. Also, there is an extra level in the game that you may partake in only if you get all the secrets. Well....if you notice, in London on the Aldwych level, there are 5 secrets in that level yet only 4 are listed in the guide. I made it through the whole game and collected all the secrets in the guide yet with cathedral key in hand, I couldn't enter the bonus level. Drats! So.....I took my time in that level once again and I found it (the fifth secret)....maybe I'll share if you really want it and can't find it. Only now, I'll have to play the whole game again to earn my bonus. Sigh."
1,"Not a helpful guide, at all!","This guide was not helpful. The instructions that tell you where to go are definatly... NOT CLEAR! An example, ""Jump down and grab the ledge"" When you actually have to: Shimmy left, Jump down, turn right, THEN grab the ledge. I actually give this guide 0 stars, but I couldn't do that... Don't waist your money on THIS book, it's useless! Just try to find a walkthrough on the net. It would be 100% better than the Prima(r) Strategy guide."
1,NOT A HELPFUL GUIDE!,"For the most part Prima guide books are very helpful, however (and that's a big however), this guide book falls short. There are many omissions (for example, a very important secret is nowhere to be found) and the narration and screen shots jump around and are not easy to follow. I do not recommend this book at all. Save your money and go online if you want more a comprehensive walkthrough."
3,"GREAT, if you've beat it!","The extremly hard content and often mixed up pictures makes this a hard to follow book for beginners. Unless you have already played and have advanced to other levels, I suggest not going to the book right away. Or at least read the book a few times before proceding."
3,"GREAT if your a pro, not as good if your not!","The book is great if you have beaten the game, maybe, 3 TIMES!! Otherwise, you'll probably be lost by the 9th page. The pictures help, but sometimes are not even correctly corresponding to the level! Many errors are in the book. Overall, the book is ok. I definitely recommend reading the book about 3 times BEFORE you start playing."
2,Solid but surface is very fragile and will chip!,"This stand looks great and is super heavy and sturdy. Unfortunately, the sturdiness does not extend to the top surface of the stand. Placing the TV on the stand caused the surface to crumble and pit in places, which detracted (quite a bit) from the sleek and groovy look that I was aiming for. I have a black stand, so I filled in the white marks from the chipping with a black marker and it looks okay from a distance. But really, there is no excuse for the fragility of the top surface -- I was really disappointed."
3,My Ventura Stand has Measles,"I ordered this wonderful retro TV stand, Ventura TV stand Black. I recently discovered a bubbly texture on the surface. I have photos too. I have the normal wear and tear but this looks like measles!!!!!! I really like the design but greatly disappointed about the wear!"
3,Nancy Friday it's not,"The Finzes' tribute to Nancy Friday's groundbreaking and endlessly fascinating series is entertaining, but clearly these ""real confessions"" have had more than a little editorial help from these writers of ""dozens of erotic novels."" Even their clumsy attempts to provide some psychological context for the stories is straight from Friday's outline.Allegedly taken from respondents to newspaper ads inviting people to discuss their fantasies, they read more like excerpts from Penthouse Forum than the voices of the contributors themselves. Make no mistake, some of the material is hot, and a mainstream audience may find their boundaries stretched by some of the voyeurism, exhibitionism, and group sex, but if you're looking for authenticity, read My Secret Garden or Women on Top."
5,The best Angra album to date? Why not?,"Many people criticize this album in not been better than their previous ones, but it all depends in the type of fan you are. I think musically this is the best Angra album of all (including the new album Rebirth). Angels Cry and Fireworks are almost in a tie, but at the end, I think this album is the winner. They have written before better lyrics than the ones of this album, but the music is so awesome that it totally makes the album worth of greatness. I think the ""musicians"" Angra really step of a notch with this album. After hearing Rebirth (which is still a good album) I found out to myself that they went to their old style again, and their probably wouldn't be another ""Fireworks"" type of album again. If you are a Power metal fan, (not a typically Angra fan), then this is an album you just have to buy."
3,Not as good as their other albums,"Well as it would be expected from Angra this is a very good album,yet it was disappointing to me because I expected them to deliver something more impressive than this. After holyland one would have thought that the next thing they would release would be truly grandeous,but this wasn't the case. this album has some great guitar based melodies,and leaves the progressive feel of holyland and inclines itself twords a more rock-like ambientation,it's more of an Iron Maiden-Joe Satriani combo than the power metal style that Angra demonstrates on Holyland or Angel's cry. good but nothing out of this world."
3,Dissapointing,"Although Angras 3rd cd ""Fireworks"" does have many good songs on it... It seems they have broken away from their brazilian sound that made them so popular in the first place... I can understand that a band wants to experiment with new things and so fourth and i support that notion.. But what was very dissapointing about this albums was the fact that most of the songs on here are very boring.... It seems like the album is lacking direction in the music.... this cd is the reason Angra split up (but later reformed) in the first place.... if you are just deciding to listen to angra pick up Holy Land or Angels Cry and avoid this album unless you are a Die Hard fan or are an avid collector :-)"
2,Should have been a Classic!!,"I presently only own two Angra albums at this point (this one and Rebirth), and I only have one thing to say...""THANK GOD FOR EDU FALASCHI!!""Fireworks should be a great album but it is marred by the horrendous voice of Andre Matos. The best thing Angra ever did was loose this guy. The songwriting is strong and the guitar playing is exceptional but each song is held back from being a classic due to the off-key and amateurish wailings of the lead singer.The production is awefully flat as well (surprising since Chris Tsangarides handled the production duties!) This kind of music desperately needs strong/dramatic production to work correctly and the mix on this one is not up to par.HOWEVER...the album does grow on you after repeated listenings, so if your a fan of the band you may want to pick it up for the musicianship. Just imagine what this album could have been if Falaschi handled the vocals instead!"
4,Compiled by people in rem mode. Good but a bit hazy,"This is clearly far better than the US Eponymous greatest hits. It is also more expansive. yet, while there are a number of great REM tunes, it just misses from being a five star affair.First, it gives each album the same weight of consideration. Murmur and Document deserve more than three tracks each. Where are ""Catapult"", and ""Disturbance at the Heron House""?Second, the choices made are good, but odd. ""Carnival of Sorts"" is picked from the debut ep but no ""Gardening At Night"". ""I Believe"" is picked from Life's Rich Pageant but no ""Superman"" or ""Begin the Begin"". Where is ""7 Chinese Bros."" from Reckoning. There was room on this disc for four more numbers.What this group needs is a remastered expanded best-of covering their IRS years. While this is the best choice, it could have been a little bit better!"
2,Bad sound,"While the more recent R.E.M. comp, ""And I Feel Fine,"" suffers from booming, compressed, in-your-face sound, this relic from the early '90s is bad in a different way: the sound is trebly and bass-shy. Unfortunately, the best-sounding comp of IRS-era R.E.M. remains ""Eponymous."" I say unfortunately because it has only 12 songs and is missing a few tracks I love, most notably ""Pretty Persuasion."" Oh well."
4,REM: The best of from 1988-1993,"This is a 16 track CD release of the best of early on REM. It includes hits like 'Perfect Circle', 'Talk About The Passion', 'Fall On Me', and 'The one I Love'. This is specifically for the lovers of the early REM. There are some great songs and material here however the songs from the late 90's were the best for REM.For the die hard REM fans."
2,I Returned It The Next Day,"I bought this product to replace my old Sony SLV-D300P dvd/vcr combo thinking that it would be more compatible with my Toshiba TV than the Sony. This was not the case, as the remote that comes with this dvd/vcr combo DOES NOT CONTROL THE TV AT ALL! There is no way to program the remote to control anything other than the dvd/vcr player. If you buy this product, be ready to use your TV remote or put in some extra money to buy a universal remote. In addition, the user interface of the player is horrible - much worse than my old Sony. I returned this the day after I bought it and exchanged it for the Sony SLV-D370P, which includes a remote to control the TV and has a great user interface. I gave this 2 stars because for the few minutes I used it, the audio/video quality was fine and the product has DIVX playback compatibility, which was one of the reasons I bought it in the first place."
3,"Everything is ok, but the remote suck.","That's right I said it. Finally someone has the guts to tell you the truth about the remote. Toshiba must have a great laugh as they go to sleep every night knowing that they made the worst remote scheme ever.1. The remote is too small. They've cram all of their remote function and it suck.2. Buttons are too small. What is this remotes for, children?3. Damn this thing. I hit the power button, I also hit the eject button and now I'm cleaning water off the floor.DAMN YOU TOSHIBA. First Pearl Harbor and now America's carpet floors."
4,Great DivX Support,"I was looking for a second VCR/DVD for an extra TV we have and chose this unit as it seemed to have good DivX support, which I was interested in playing with. Well, the DivX support has turned out to be rock-solid, playing everything I've thrown at it in countless formats burned on DVD-R, CD-RW and CD-R. Its never failed to decode a file. I've moved the unit to our video room and we've been enjoying it ever since. It is true the quality of playback of the VCR isn't great, but its good enough for my child's videos. In addition, the remote isn't too fancy, but the unit has excellent controls accessible from the remote for controlling things like picture size, jpeg playback, etc."
4,So Far so Good,"I really haven't had this unit long enough to give an in depth evaluation of this product. For me it was somewhat difficult to set up. However, I have always had problems setting up VCR's throughout my VCR buying history. After consulting with a knowledgeable friend on how to kick this thing into gear, the unit appears to work very nicely. Once you understand the total setup, it is quite easy and simple to operate. I gave this a 4 star rating because I believe this VCR/DVD combo will do just fine. The only negative is that it will only record to the channel you are watching. For the price however, I can live with that."
1,"If you plan to use this for more than 6 months, don't buy","I bought two of these units, exactly one week apart. I liked the first one so much, I bought a second one for the family room. 6 months later, almost to the day, the DVD drive on the first unit stopped working (I had to take the thing apart to extract the trapped DVD). One week later, on the second unit, the VHS tray began seeing a tape even though none was loaded which meant I couldn't load a real tape. So, 6 months after buying two combo units, I now have one DVD player and one VCR."
1,Terrible Quality,"After less than a year of limited use, the picture changes from color to black & white. The problem occurs intermittently, and it is completely random. I did not purchase an extended warranty plan because for something less than $100 it seemed silly. But after limited use for something like this to happen just screams out 'JUNK' to me."
4,Don't Judge This Book By Its Cover,"This is actually a fantastic, highly original zombie novel. Don't let the dumb cover art dissuade you. I seem to be in the minority here, but I think this is Bryan Smith's best novel, overall. I really wasn't into most of the other 'fan faves' like ""The Killing Kind"" and ""The Freakshow"", but this book is really a lot of fun for horror fans. If you're looking for a great, different take on zombies, this is must read."
1,Simply Bad,I'm usually a fan of everything zombie related but I have to say this book wasn't a good read. The writing was stifled and the storyline lacking.I found myself pushing through the pages just to get the book read. It was then added to the goodwill pile. It really makes you wonder how some stuff gets published.
3,Pretty good,"I just finished reading this book, and I enjoyed it. It wasn't great, but it was still a good read, especially if you like zombie fiction. My actual rating would be three and a half stars, but Amazon doesn't let you give half stars, and I didn't think it quite earned four stars. Some other reviewers have mentioned the abundance of metaphors, and they do have a point, it was a bit distracting at the beginning of the story, but he lightens up on them by the end.I also enjoyed the character of Melinda, she's one of those characters you just love to hate. I would like to see a sequel so that we could find out what happened with the Erin character."
5,Good old fashioned fun,"I really enjoyed this book. It was a good old fashioned horror romp, dealing with one of my favorite monsters: Zombies. It was a very quick read, the plot progressed at a very fast pace, and I read it in one day. I would definitely recommend this book to any Laymon or Keene fans."
1,I don't expect much from zombie books...but COME ON,"I enjoy a good zombie book or movie, and I don't expect much more than to be entertained. This book fell short of even that. The characters are bumbling, mind-numbingly stupid morons, making it difficult to care if they end up in the clutches of a zombie or not. Bryan Smith's fixation on the Goth character, Melinda, and his attempts to convey sexual tension are embarrassingly poorly written. What could have been dramatic scenes end up falling flat and are non-events. By the last page, I wished the entire town would just end up dead already, so the damn book would be over."
1,Amazon really needs to allow negative star ratings...,"I couldn't make it past the useless prologue and first chapter. Everything was so heavy handed, it was completely absurd! The painful info dump in the prologue. The overly-complicated descriptions of mundane things. The lengthy and tiresome internal monologues loaded with passive verbs. *sigh* Very painful. I mean, he even refers to a ""mysterious stranger"" as an interloper for cryin' out loud!I remember some silly little description of leaves being blown across the sidewalk like the voices of the dead straining to be heard or some other silly nonsense. Okaaay...we get it. It's a novel about zombies, you can stop hitting us over the head with that fact and just get on with it!Really, just pick another novel. Any novel. I don't care if it's a non-fiction instructional about underwater basket weaving. Buy it instead of this crap."
2,A dud of a novel,"As cheesy as the cover is, the innards are even more cheesier. Talking zombies, poor descriptions and dialogue. Where was the editor? Did he even read this book or buy it because it was a zombie book? I'm giving it two stars for effort. Even the plot didn't hold up well--a scary book makes people rise up from the dead. Adn who does the book belong to? THE DEATHBRINGER! It should be titled the DEATHGO-AWAYER."
2,More like an episode of Buffy then a Zombie Book,"This book had some good stuff in it but the whole magic mojo didn't set well with me. For some reason I never felt frightened reading this book like I have with other zombie fiction. Don't get me wrong Bryan Smith does a pretty good job of describing action sequences well and had a nice full circle to the story but the book, the reaper, and some of the random scenes like the hippie encounter and serial killer scene I could have done with out.I do lke that the living dead where hard to kill but the supernatural theme for some reason made it seem like a Buffy the vampire episode...or maybe a season finaly.And as a disclaimer I like Buffy."
1,WARNING! BUYER BEWARE! HORRIBLE SERVICE!,"This ""company"" is a JOKE--one month after placing my order I have still only received half, when the whole order should have come before Christmas--my seven year old son is SO DISAPPOINTED!!! And I have had to email them constantly to only get a three word response, with barely an apology! DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS AWFUL COMPANY! Even if you have to spend a few dollars more go somewhere else--please do not waste your time and risk the disappointment!!"
4,Strauss is brilliant and articulate and difficult (as always),"Leo Strauss collects essays from a novel perspective in this volume. I bought this to read about his take on Maimonides, and esp. his Guide for the Perplexed. He supplies context and continues his work of explicating the complex thought f Maimonides as only he does.I like it."
4,Very thought provoking,"This book could be better organized than it is -- sometimes it seems Epstein wants to give us a complete, systematic statement of his life's work as a legal theorist, whereas at other times he seeems content to think of this book as a series of loosely related explorations or essays.The organizational problem explains why I can't give this five stars. But I can enthusiastically give it four. The critique of the positivistic jurisprudence of H.L.A. Hart (pp. 50-54) puts more of value in five pages than many authors can put in a whole book!"
2,Very irresponsible seller,"I am very surprise how irresponsible the seller is: he offered his product and then after the product was not available he has never contacted me or answered my e-mail when I have asked him to remove the order from my list.I did not put 1 star only because I personally do not use the word ""Hate"".So he has received 2 stars only because of my personal believes but not because he deserve any stars at all.Very Irresponsible seller."
1,Please look to the excellent mezzos for the best music money can buy.,"Over the past ten years, I have been asked to listen to albums of what the public has been misled to believe is classical vocal music (such as this one) because those who have purchased the albums have thought I would appreciate them as I am a singer. This album and the others by this singer are not opera, nor are they classical. This singer is pop. I have held my tongue and waited for this trend of popera to pass, but it isn't and I'm vexed at the comparison of singers such as Ms. Jenkins to legitimate voices.If you are looking for some truly exceptional music by singers who have actually been on stage in an opera outside of grad school, try Stephanie Blythe, Vivica Genaux, Susan Graham, Jennifer Larmore, Ewa Podles and more I'm certainly forgetting. This CD is misleading many people about what opera really is. Ms. Jenkins would never sing the role of Carmen on stage, and should not be recording it."
4,Good but why get rid of 3 of the songs that are on the UK CD,This is a very good CD.I do not have the US version but I do have the UK one and this version does not have three of the songs that are on the UK one.
1,????,"Voice is OK, but not a concert-opera class mezzo. Sings and records mostly cheesy material. Has merchandized herself toward the non-intellectual market. Reminds me of Lawrence Welk or the King Family Singers. Don't waste you money."
4,It's about time this was rereleased!,"Of the contemporary singers of Weill's music -- there are many and great ones, too -- Dagmar Krause posesses a voice closest to Lotte Lenya in quality. I suspect it is an acquired taste for some, but an instant favorite for others. On this recording, she mixes the popular, well-known songs with a host of lesser-known songs that are also deserving of attention. As a whole, this is a valuable disc!"
3,It's very simple,"From 1973 till 1994, Ferry had 9 recordings. To make a best of, I bought all nine, used for around with shipping, $50 and with my little recording studio, made my Best of Brian Ferry, and it's just fantastic. I am doing these a lot these days to the fact that most artists, or the companies that own their music are usually, lousy compilators. They should do their homework. Anyway, it's worth it..."
5,Secrets of Masons?????????,"In comparison to the other DVD documentaries about the background information of Angels and Demons this one falls flat, but the section regarding Fremasonry is quite interesting.Either the Mason's are extremely stupid or extremely scary.Like Dan Brown, I understand it to be the latter! The spokesman defending themasons from conspiracy theories,(and oddly enough protecting some political big wigs) happens to be the nefariousJames Wasserman, do a google on this guy, he is a member of OTO, and a follower of Aleister Crowley, a satanist(claimed Lucifer was his guardian angel) and a man who was thrown out of Italy for sacrificing, orphaned boys.The other defender of Freemasonry happens to be (like the antagonist in the novel), an Arab, and a government proponent of neoconservative ideology to Arab nations.......uhm, like do the math"
1,Fiction trying to explain fiction.,"This video tries to ""correct"" Dan Brown's novel. Unfortunately, based on history and the Bible both are inaccurate. If you're really interested what's behind the secret societies read ""Rule by Secrecy"" by Jimm Marrs. From a Biblical perspective read ""The Dark Side of Freemasonry."" If want free info. there is a good lecture by Prof. Walter Veith on ""Secret Societies"" available on youtube or amazingdiscoveries dot org."
2,Prelude To Da Vinci Code,"This is a break down of Dan Brown's novel Angels & Demons with part II on Freemasonry. Aaah not so hot, a basic rehash of all conspiracies linked to religion, secret societies (illuminati), artists (Bruzinsky?Rome?) and scientists (Galileo). But could be used as foreplay for his knew movie Da Vinci Code now playing in theaters."
1,the worst blindside album of all,"i love the first release that blindside had put out, so i had highly anticipated the release of ""a thought crushed my mind"". It's sad to say that i was totally let down. This is one of the worst cd's ever released by any band. The boys from blindside take a stab at hard/core and it's a disgrace to a good genre. This cd says to me, ""We're trying really hard to be a hardcore band but don't know how"". To me it sounds like a buch of noise, not music. If you like choatic music, get system of a down, not this cd. If you just like blindside pick up there other releases but stay away from this one."
1,UAAAHH?,boy this stuff is pure garbage . Jesus is gonna be right here rockin to that stuff YEA! WWJD ? Trash it! Come on guys just go secular and get it over.
2,Though it was the Silence Blindside album.,"I really liked Blindside when I was younger but this album in particular is before they found their melodic rifts & signature vocals. But for $3, I'm not complaining."
1,Another waste,"The vocals are mediocre. They've been done to death. Another scream for no reason then sing. How can you feel any emotion attached to a song when the screams aren't synched up to anything meaningful?Aside from that, the guitar was ho-hum. Forget the vocals for a minute, they can sing pretty well for a couple of songs. Try and block out all the vocals...what do you hear? I hear mediocrity. There is nothing new to the music itself. While trying to make the guitars sound heavy, they have instead regressed into mind-numbingly simple.Blah, I say! BLAH!"
5,BLINDSIDE's BEST SO FAR,this cd is awsome start to finish and is even better than the first cd it's way heavier and more structured than the first cd if you like Christcore with a twist check out this cd now
3,Could have done better,"This album, to me at least, was a dissapointment. Blindside changed their music way to much, for rap-core type to screaming heavy metal. Most of the time you cant even understand what they are saying, and that takes away from its quality. Some songs, on the other hand are really good, such as King of the Closet. Not the greatest of all cd's, but if you really like them, go ahead and buy it."
4,Tyler's Review,"This is a pretty good cd if you are a fan of harrdcore music, but it isn't as good as their first. The track I liked most would probably be King of the Closet."
4,What is Blindside?,"Blindside's new album is definitely more aggressive and out of control than the first which is a good thing. The vocals for the new album are completely different than the first. The only complaint I have is that some of the album felt kind of repetitive. The song ""Nothing but skin,"" is a masterpiece in it own right. ""King of the closet,"" really sets the tone for the whole album. Great album."
4,yikes...,"blindside. a band that i don't know that much about. i saw them play with project 86 and p.o.d. last year and the kids from europe tore it up. still, i wan't all that impressed. i have seen many bands tear it up live but when i got the cd, i was less than impressed. anyway, i was in nashville a few weeks ago and my friend was rockin' this cd. unbeknownst to me, it was the new blindside disc. ""king of the closet"" is the scariest tune that i have heard in a while. it makes the disc worth buying -- that song alone. however, the tracks are somewhat poorly produced (especially considering that it is on solidstate/tooth and nail). i expected a little more from this disk, but it is still good nonetheless."
5,THE SWEDES ARE BA-ACK!,"This album is exactly what it takes to quench your thirst for fast and furious hardcore, and its Christian hardcore at that. From the ripping vocals from christain, to the heavy guitar riffs from simon. This album doesnt slow down much either, and just when you get a breather from a few all but silent moments, you get a loud ""back of the throat"" scream right in your ear! Get this album, and get it now!"
5,hardcore fans: buy this cd,"One word: spectacular. Blindside's innovative use of orchestral stringed instruments (bass, cello, violins) is unconventional, but perfectly timed, and complimentary to thier unique hardcore style. Not all of their songs are full of melodic violins, however. ""Vow of Silence"", ""King of the Closet"", and ""Act"" (to name a few), demonstrate Blindside's ability to really rock. Hard. Overall, this CD is excellent, and one of my personal favorites. I highly recommend it to any hardcore music fan."
1,hmm.. how do i say this gently....,"The only emotion I find welling up in response to this group's ""sound"" is dismay... dismay at the dreadful rendition of ""Hotel California"", one the the greatest songs of all time and an Eagles masterpiece, and dismay at the possibility of such a talentless group ever getting their work on a marketable cd (is it really marketable, have any copies been sold?). I mean, seriously, in this day and age of free music downloads, would anyone in their right mind think to purchase such a heap of cacophanous discord? I suppose if one listened long enough to these ""songs"" one's mental capacity might actually devolve to the point of thinking this was good stuff!! ughh"
3,"State of Grace II not the ""bang"" that SG I was...","I was so impressed with the quite forcefulness and spirituality of SG I that I couldnt wait for the 2nd release. After reviewing SG II, I am a bit disappointed personally. I love almost all of Paul Schwartz work, however this one just had the feeling of ""trying too hard to be something that it was not."" Not nearly as ""powerful"" without being overbearing as SG I was... but I'll take it for what it is... metaspiritual new-age relaxing music. Until next time I remain...WCJ"
4,A Pleasant Recording,"I really wanted Grace I instead of Grace II but I was able to pick this one up at a bargain close out price so I went ahead and acquired it. There are some highlights to this CD that are quite fulfilling but I would still recommend Grace I over this one. I final got Grace1 myself and have listened to it extensively I no longer feel that it is better, they both are about equal and both have highlights and low points."
1,FLOUNDERING IN THE DARK,"I might not be the smartest person in the world but I would like to know how people can write a review on ""State of Grace 2"" by Paul Schwartz when Amazon fail to provide any details about the album in question.With no point of reference, such as:How many tracks are on the album.The name of the tracks.Clearly Amazon can't be bothered to provide that basic information in this instance let alone a 30 second snippit.Unless you are Paul Schwartz fan who blindly buys anything and everything by the artist then clearly this album is for you.As for the rest of us - until I see it in the shops I'll reserve judgement.... and I'll bet you will too."
4,titles of tracks,"For those who need the track titles, here they are:1 magnificat2 turning to peace3 curación (sunlight on water)4 stabat mater5 quia respexit6 fear not7 et misericordia8 suscepit israel9 ave maria10 gloria11 let meeasily obtained from paul's web site, http://www.paulschwartz.com which also has full bio, photos, tour dates, lyrics and audio snips."
2,Formatting Issues!,"While it seems like a fine collection of poetry (though the selections were made in 1918), the line breaks within each stanza are not preserved in the Kindle edition, which is a pretty big problem. If you're patient, you can get some good reading out of this, but the formatting is big hurdle."
5,This Book is Amazing,"The book When She Hollers is fantastic. I found it in my school library back when I was in high school and I kept it for myself because just by reading the back cover I knew I had to have it. It reminded me so much of my life at that point and it gave me the strength to keep going just like Tish did. I'm now in college and I dealt with my abuser, too. Tish's story kept me strong and allowed me to finally gain the strength to tell. I'm so thankful for this book and I think any teenager who is being abused should read this... or every teenager for that matter because it's really insightful."
3,Beware! This book may be disturbing to your children,"This book was assigned to my daughter's class (12 year olds)and they were suppose to read and discuss it in a group. I do't know many 12 year olds who would willingly discuss the subject matter in a group (esp. a mixed sex group). My daughter got 16 pages into it and came to us very upset so my wife and I read it late that night. This book is very powerful and can be very upsetting to kids. I feel it is too intense for 12 year olds. I would not recommend it for young adults unless you as a parent are willing to read this with your children and discuss it. Be prepared for it troubling your child. It talks of another abuse victim committing suicide and no one believing the victim. It also contains very explicit language like: ""He F***s me!!""."
5,A good book,"This book is exellent! Voigt does a wonderful job of letting you into the mind of Tish, a seventeen year old girl who was sexualy abused by her stepfather. Since I am an amature writer and an excessive reader, I could see both sides of the ending. As a writer, I thought the ending was good, and left the person at a point where they could think and reflect, with the satisfaction of Tish's determination. But as a reader, I am angry at the author for not describing the confrontation between Tish and Tonnie (her stepfather). I sugest it to readers age eleven and over, for I, in my opinion, did not find it all that disturbing, as I have read in almost every review and anybody else that I have discussed the book with."
