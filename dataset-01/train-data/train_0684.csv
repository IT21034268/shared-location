1,Innumeracy redux,"..... If you think Talbott has proven his thesis with data and numbers, you show yourself as a Class A math and economics dunce. This book will persuade those who already believe, but if you want sound and reasoned analysis you won't find it in this text."
1,hasty generations and fallacies,The book contains many hasty generations and fallacies. It's the beginning of 2008 and the rates are at the record low's. Real estate is still a very appreciating asset(unless of course your fico is in the 400's and you've got a hard money loan)
1,setting the record straight,"The back flap of this book includes these words: ""Are you among the millions of Americans who lost thousands in the tech-stock crash of 2000? Do you wish somebody had said something about the dangers of staking your future on overpriced, risky investments?"" The fact is, there were at least two best-selling books that warned of the pending crash in tech-stocks BEFORE it happened-""The Internet Bubble"" and ""Irrational Exuberance."" Be nice if you could do a little research to get your facts straight on this kind of thing!"
2,"Bad advice, bad person",Mr Talbott actually suggests in this book that you either sell your house or buy put options on Fannie Mae... and that is after he convincingly shows that house prices only ever go up...That is both stupid and unAmerican. No wonder Goldman Sachs fired him.Verdict:Ignore
4,As a homeowner/Real Estate Investor,"As a home owner in the most expensive housing market (SF bay Area) this book scared me to death. As a Real Estate Investor who would never dream of buying investment property in this state, for a variety of reasons, I'm excited about the opportunites coming my way. This gives me time to get experience and training in buying foreclosures and REO's. If what the author says/predicts comes true there will never be a better time to buy properties at a bigger discount (less than wholesale) and rents should actaully stay the same or go higher because the people that just had their house forclosed upon have to live somewhere, ie rentals. Keep it positive by paying down the mortgage take profits later.Biggest thing I learned was to be smart about your debt and debt leverage. Pay down the mortgage as much as you can. There are very fews bad things that can be said about having too little/no debt."
5,Midwest Fiddling at its Finest,"This is the finest collection of Lyman's recordings that he ever assembled. Each tune shows his mastery of the instrument, and the years of dedication devoted to mastering it. It's only a pity that Lyman didn't record more of his work."
5,Innocence.......I think not,"Jane Mendelsohn's INNOCENCE is an inrtiguing novel of horror. A young girl named Beckett just moved into Manhattan after her mother's death. The first person to even talk to her is a guy named Tobey who introduces her to the three most popular girls in school. The next night they are found dead in what looks like a triple suicide. Her father meets the attractive school nurse and they get married. At first Beckett thinks that Pamela, the nurse, is just a normal step mother. But when she starts finding bolood and getting akward stomach pains she starts getting suspicious. Her boyfriend Tobey is attacked in a bathroom at a diner and sent into a coma. From then on Beckett has to fight for her life even if some people she cares about are murdered by her evil step mother. In the very end it turns out to be a brutal battle of good versus evil. Beckett overcomes Pamela so she can never bother anyone in Manhattan or the world ever again."
1,A terrible second novel,"Please. This is the same author who wrote I was Amelia Earhart??? How is that possible? If you like books about female middle-aged vampires preying on virginal but menstruating girls for their blood, you will love this one! I did finish it, but only because I had agreed to read. If you don't believe me, read the hilarious short review in the New Yorker, last week in August. A terrible book, one I wished I had never read. It is allegorical and that is the only reason to read it. Other than that, it reads like the movie treatment (and a bad one at that) that it was to begin with. Beware second novels...especially ones that had been earlier regected. There is probably a reason why!"
2,Innocence,"First and foremost, I disliked this book by the choppy one paragraph and 3 spaces approach to the writing. One page chapters along with the choppy writing style made everything feel short and forced. The story itself was dramatically bland. Nothing held my attention and it the plot never flowed well. The characters were not well rounded and I was left with really only knowing the main character, Beckett. By the end of the book I was so irritated by the lack of details and explanations with things that I almost put it down. I guess I probably should of because the end fell short of all expectations I might have had. Also, drinking tea made out of tampon teabags was super gross and made the whole thing even weirder and less enjoyable."
2,Complete Disappointment,"When I started reading this book, I thought the different writing style was interesting and might add an extra dimension to the book. Yet, besides having to decipher the conversations taking place in the book, since no punctuation was used, about 3/4 through the book I realized I knew nothing about the main character. I reread the jacket of the book, which boasted a ""heroin you won't soon forget"" and almost laughed out loud. I made myself finish the book, hoping it would redeem itself, and I was greatly disappointed at the end. It seemed like lazy writing, and it left no lasting effect with me, like good writing should."
3,Innocence Twisted into Descriptive setting.,"This book is gothic. I chose this novel for a class read for a topic for coming-of-age. Not much to it for sure. Beckett loses her mom, gets her period and experiences some death in her life.Some of the descriptions do not relate to the stories at all. The author tries too hard to make us understand what Beckett is going through. The author uses too much similes to give us vivid description which she is good at. The story itself is not contriguing. It does not seemed to have a acme point(when she figures out that her step mother is not what she thoght to be?)The author tries to give forshadowing points but,she gives so much you know it has something to do with Gothic and Fantasy.J. Mendelsohn repeats hard with the ""blood"". Each ""blood"" seems to be meaningful in Beckett's life.I give 3 star because the story was below the average lineBut some of the language she used was good."
2,Fluff and not even good fluff at that,"One of the most inane books I have ever read. About the only positive thing I can say is that it took only 3 hours to finish. I had to run out and buy a real book with some substance right away after reading ""Innocence"" and finding myself shaking my head in disbelief. I thought I saw early potential a few times so I stuck with it, however the farther into this story I got, the more I read just to laugh at the story line. Really bad. I was luke warm about ""I was Amelia Earhart"" but now this author is completely off my list. Who has time to waste on a book this bad?"
1,Oh Those Poor Trees!,"This book is one of the worst that I've ever read in life. It doesn't have any person that you want to learn more about, in fact, by the end of this novel, you'll be glad Beckett finally shut-up. The novel seems to be writen in some horrible attempt at poetry at points and lacks a plot. In fact, it is not until near the end of the novel do we learn anything about the storyline. For a book that seemed to gain praise from many, it makes me sad that the trees, that were used to make this book died in vien. Do yourself a favor and stay away from this book. I'm just glad I only paid a doller for it."
1,No one should pay for this book!,I will not repeat what others have written here about this book... but I've really got to say it. THIS BOOK IS THE WORST BOOK I'VE EVER READ!
2,"oh, the angst of being a poor little rich girl","There's not much to like about this book. The narrative is purposely disjointed, supposedly to mirror the mixed up state of mind of our narrator. Unfortunately, it's hard to feel very sorry for her since she doesn't seem to have it so bad. She's haunted by visions of bad slasher films with blood, bats, gore, ketchup, and has to be put on medication to get by day to day. Getting her period only seems to make things worse. There's a slight love interest with Toby, but there's so little character development that it's hard to care what happens. Overall, this book was tiresome to read and depressing as well. I did not think the writing was very noteworthy either. The only good thing is that it's not very long. Other than that, I can't think of much to recommend it."
1,"God, that was awful","This is maybe the worst book I've ever read. It was horrible, trite, and totally unredeeming. Please don't make the same mistake I did by wasting money and time on this book.If the author was trying to make some impossibly deep statement on young girls in society today, she should have picked some other vehicle than this silly, stupid tale of vampires. I don't care if they're real, or in the head of the protagonist. It all ends up with the same conclusion - this book is awful and so silly in the worst way.Every page found me stunned that it could get worse. But get worse it did. If I have to read the phrase ""menstrual blood"" that many times again in a book, then ...And for the love of Pete, stop comparing this book and Beckett to Holden Caulfield. To compare this writing ""style"", and this book to J.D. Salinger's masterpiece of how it feels to be adolescent and alone is incredibly far off base. Sure, they're both written in English, but any similarity ends there."
4,Chilling!,"I had no idea what to expect when I picked up Innocence. I was confused at first then really got into the book. Beckett is our unusual heroine who is adapting to a new school and move after losing her mother. She stumbles into a dark conspiracy and must fight for her life. The story was really twisted but enjoyable. At times, though, I had to reread several portions to keep up."
2,A little too deep?,"This book thoroughly confused me. Call me shallow...but I just did not understand. The characters didn't seem to be developed enough for me to understand anyone but Beckett. I am a big fan of contemporary poetry and this book just didn't have that spark with my imagination. It's just too vague for my tastes. I can't tell if it was all just a dream, or if certain parts even happened...If anyone would like to explain it to me...you can email me @ Theater_girl@excite.com To people who haven't read this book yet....I don't recommend it, unless you're a big fan of bloody things and vagueness..."
4,"Cheesy song, but talent is obvious","Although this song is a bit gimmicky, it is obvious that this duo has some musical talent. Jemma has a wonderful voice!"
5,Awesome Regis Song,"This is the hit of the summer. I loved it. This is a song for the the Tv Smash ""Who Wants To Be a Millionaire"" Jack & Jemma did a great job writting a hit song for the show. this could be the new Macarena. A Definete buy"
1,Someone make the BAD MAN stop,"As if ABC has to air this show almost every day of the week... does that mean we'll now have to endure this on the RADIO.There hasn't been a CHEEZIER attempt at cashing in on a blind lemming trend since the dreadful ""PAC MAN FEVER"".And if I have to attend a WEDDING that plays this slosh, I'll walk out.JUST SAY NO!"
3,Okay,"I didn't like this book as much as the other Daisy books. It was still entertaining. I have been reading these books pretty much in order, so I wanted to finish it, but it did not hold my attention like the other have."
3,I made a mistake,"Hello, Please take out my review. I was wrong. Galapagos Islands info is great, I just looked for it not carefully enough.My apologies."
2,Dissapointed,"I tried to find an article on Galapagos Islands, it showed a poor quality picture and one paragraph of text. In order to expand the picture I had to switch CDROMs. I could not find any history of the islands, climate and animals. It's not what you expect from Encyclopedia. Finally I went to a web site britannica.com and got more than enough on the subject, much faster and for free."
1,HEADACHE,I was dissapointed with this software. It crashed my computer within minutes of installation. What I was able to see of the program looked great but as I said it was very short lived. A subsequent disk we got crashed as well. I won't be purchasing this software again.
2,Huge disappointment!,"Henry Morton, my favorite Bow Street Runner from ""The Thief Taker"", is back again. However, this time I was not intrigued by the mystery he is attempting to solve. The mistress of a count is found dead, having been tortured by thumbscrews. Napoleon has been captured and is being held on a ship in Plymouth Harbor after a lengthy war with England. People on small boats flock to catch a glimpse of him. As other murders occur, Henry is sent on a long chase to capture the murderer.Maybe I am not enough of a history buff to keep the loyalists and royalists straight in my mind. Or maybe I just didn't care enough about the characters or the plot line. Either way, this book was a chore to finish. Perhaps that is why it didn't even merit a hard-cover publication."
4,when the mark twain prize was being given posthumously to,"GEORGE CARLIN,there was an alter if you will,or at least a small display on stage,as his family from the balcony looked on and the finest comedians of our age paid their loving tribute.In that display, prominantly in front was beer cans on the moon .Nuf said.willywy thanks you."
3,Just buy 'Sanders Truckstop' and skip this one.,"This record just did not make me laugh near as much as the amazing 'SANDERS TRUCKSTOP'. If you are a die-hard Sanders fan, like I am, you will want it (BEER CANS ON THE MOON) for your collection, but it just didn't impress me very much."
1,Caveat Emptor,This is not a complete version of the original LP. It is sadly truncated and missing at least one key track. Beware.
2,shameless Jeep/Mopar brand promo,"Not worth your money. It reads like a paid advertisement. Spends way too much time talking about how great the new Jeep vehicles are and how important it is to use geniune mopar parts. Very little actual reference material for the DIY enthusiast or wannabe serious Jeeper. What little reference there is, is for CJs. Seems like something they would hand out at a Jeep dealership.I don't agree with a lot of what this guy says. What's this about only needing 33"" tires at the largest? For me, bigger, sloppier obstacles = more fun = need more traction and clearance = bigger tires.Take my advice - aftermarket parts are almost always the way to go for price, warranty length, and reliability - don't get your parts or accessories through Chrysler/Mopar if you can help it.I recommend Jim Allen's books, such as the Jeep 4x4 Performance Handbook. Much better intro to Jeepin'."
2,To all TJ/YJ owners,"Even though the newest edition says it has been updated to include up to the 1999 model, information on the YJ/TJ Wranglers is slim at best. It is only two stars for all YJ/TJ owners. This is s true CJ or classic Jeep owner book and has much info on those models. A lot info in this book is too basic. It needs severe updating for the newer models. I would rate it a four star for any CJ owner."
1,Useless book,"Just about the most useLESS book I have ever bought. The coverage is way too broad and general. There are little to NO specific areas covered. Just general information that can be obtained in the owners manual that comes with the vehicle. All in all, not even worth taking to the throne room."
2,Does not live up to its claims about Grand Cherokee coverage,"This book is well written and easy to read. In parts it reads like a factory representative trying to sell Mopar parts. What I found most disappointing was the very few pages of material dealing with the Grand Cherokee ZJ chassis. There are a couple of sales literature type pages for the Grand Cherokee and an attempt to introduce the 2005 Grand Cherokee as being the most and greatest. The author's failure to provide meaningful data on Grand Cherokee engine performance, suspension up grades, discussion of the F/R disk braking system, or other performance type modifications is a great disappointment. The CJ and other ""Little Jeeps"" are covered in detail and with considerable attention to what is and what is not safe to do with them."
5,Excellent Book,"A wealth of knowledge written by not only an expert on jeeps, but a good writer as well. The information included is a must have for anyone who wants to work on their jeep."
5,Thank you,"thank you so much, the book was great, the shipping was fast, thank you thank you thank you!!"
1,You can find better ones,"Not a good book, not specialized in anything, when it actualy get to the poind of the explanation/suggestion it direct you to a local dealer (well thanks a lot)try the ""The Jeep Bible"""
2,talking clock,I ordered this for my grandmother. This clock would be great if it was louder. My grandmother has both hearing and vision problems. She stated it was not loud enough for her to hear. If the person using this did not have hearing issues I would give it 5 stars. It works great except for the volume issue.
5,Great Product,"My 86-year-old father has Macular Degeneration, and has a very difficult time reading calendars and clocks. I bought this for him for Christmas, and he loves it! It is easy to use, and he got a big kick out of the female British accent. The only drawback, is that he accidentally hits the alarm switch now and then when he picks it up, but it cab covered with some tape. They should make one without the alarm."
2,Too many birds,"This is the first Carmen McRae CD that I have bought. Initially, I liked the idea of a theme CD where all the songs are about something. However, after listening to it, I find that there is a real ""so what"" quality about it. So they're birds. Big deal. There's nothing here that really stirs the emotions. And Carmen's voice lacks depth, although she has a good range."
2,"It's good, but not...","If you are looking for do-it-yourself abortion information like I was, this is not a good book for that. It is a history book. It's good, but not an abortionary (abortion dictionary)."
4,Exactly as pictured,"The strand is exactly as pictured. I didn't give it 5 stars, because I thought the nacre feel on my teeth would be the same as a real pearl (since they used the same pearl material). I always rub pearls on my teeth to see if they are real, a trick I learned from a jeweler. So, having said that, these are along the quality lines of Majorica and other nice costume jewelry. I wanted a gray pearl necklace, and this faux version will suffice until I save up for a real one. The knots between each pearl add a nice touch, there is a nice weight to the necklace, and the clasp is nice (albeit sterling silver). Nice for the price."
5,Perfect,"This is a very strong, well built hub. I'm more than happy with the quality. Thanks for a great product!"
3,"I love Weather Report, don't you?","I think the playing and arrangements are very good. Everyone does a great job. It's just that Scott Kinsey was not born Josef Zawinul! However, in every note and harmony, in every melodiy, he pays homage to Zawinul and his progeny. It's cool. Joe is older and he's not releasing nearly enough of his own music. At least Kinsey and his guys can slow it down. Joe's forgotten how to do that in favor of his Afrocentic hyper-beat stuff.Scott Kinsey has sooo much going on. I just want him to tap into him... 'Nuff said."
5,Good Company to purchase CD's from,I bought three CD's from this manufacturer. They are all great. The words and music match and are very close to the real tempo and speed. My friends were shocked how easy it was to sing these songs without getting off track with the music or words.
2,"It's 60, not 90 Minutes (like it's supposed to be)",(Please see my review of theDVD editionof this title.)
4,Two things worth mentioning,"1 - The book description given above is wrong - it was written about a different book by the same publisher. This book takes place in a fantasy setting - kings, princesses, warriors, outlaws, etc. (ETA: This refers to the original publisher's description, which has since been changed.)2 - This book is a sequel to the novel ""Savage Surrender"" by the same author."
4,wild kingdom,"wild kingdom is an entertaining tale set in another realm : women raised to despise men , to enslave them and abuse them .a beautiful king and a handsome warlord fighting to the death , with the princess as the prize...love , lust ,passion and desire...glad for the happy ending.SANDRA REIS."
3,Solid story of sisters,"Olivia Hunt, trying to make movies in Hollywood her way, suddenly learns her little sister, living a Donna Reed life in her hometown, has cancer. Written as a series of letters.Good women's lit."
4,The True and Outstanding Adventures of the Hunt Sisters,"Olivia Hunt is a Hollywood producer in LA and the older sister of Maddie, just diagnosed with leukemia. Throughout Olivia's letters and emails we follow her life; work issues, personal issues, and dealing with Maddie's illness.Olivia is five years older than Madeline and has always had a caring function in her life, whether it's camping out overnight or making up stories of ""the True and Outstanding Adventures of the Hunt Sisters"" to help her go to sleep.At times, she resents the attention she has always had to pay to her sister, and now her sister's illness forces her to confront her feelings and makes her realize how much she really loves her.I found this book to be touching, at times humorous, and at times sad. The format of being told only through Olivia's correspondence was unique and interesting. Be sure to read the author's notes at the end!"
5,"Fast, easy to read very well written and touching","I know I will love a book if it grabs me from the first page. The book is written in letter format. Very well written, very touching, at times humerous book. Loved it."
3,"Great read, TOO much F---- word","This book is slow starting and the hooks you. The story is sad, funny, heartwarming and really really good. BUT the totally unnecessary and very frequent use of the f--- word add NOTHING to the story or the book. Disappointing. I hope she thinks before using it so much in her next book."
3,"Well, hmm.","First, a confession: I find epistolary novels extremely tiresome and more than slightly contrived. Second, yet another confession: I've only read about 3/4 of this book. Third, however, I've vascillated between finding it slightly amusing to downright tedious. Did I mention mawkish, too? I've found myself skipping entire sections -- something I haven't done since I realized that, in my post-grad school existence, I really don't *need* to finish a book I don't like -- with the fading hope that it might get a wee more compelling, a little more sophisticated, and a modicum less... well... self-consciously outre and whiny. Now, despite this rather tetchy review, it's not an *awful* book, and the author does show great promise, but it just ain't for me."
2,Terrible,"I could not relate to Olivia, the main character, at all. She came across very one-dimensional and shallow. She is extremely self-centered and the author presents very little balance to that.Am I supposed to feel sorry for her when she has no where to live as she carries her $700 pair of shoes?I just cannot get behind a story with seemingly no moral, no point, very little plotline who highlights a superficial woman that bemoans her life for trivial reasons."
4,It was like reading someone elses mail,"If you like letter writing and reading, you'll like this book, but you need to fill in some of the blanks between the letters. Just keep your eye on the dates and places that the letters are written. She is not as good a letter writer as the Woman of Independet Means tho. Need to develop the characters a little better. Our book club enjoyed it. Much discussion on relationships!"
5,Encore Encore..... Bravo Elisabeth Robinson,From the minute I started reading page one of The True And Outstanding Adventures Of The Hunt Sisters till I finished the book I was moved by the relationships and the great love between the sisters. It was heart renching to read and yet moving at the same time. Maddie and Olivia forge a relationship which is thrown off balance at time by Maddie's illness and Olivia's since of dispair at not being able to help. Maddies illness forces them closer together. Also added to the mix is Michael Olivia's ex. I would highly reccomend this book and and waiting for Ms. Robinson to write her next novel. The Book takes twists and turns yet in the end Ms. Robinson proves ' SISTERS ARE SISTERS FOR LIFE.'
3,A little manipulative,"Easy to read. But there is an obvious manipulation on the part of the writer, and a bit too self serving. Has a bit too much of a Hollywood way of playing out."
2,Couldn't finish,"I got suckered in by this book by the praise on the cover. I hate when that happens. It fell far short of expectation and I quit halfway in. It's very one sided, written in one voice in one letter after another. The problem: I never once believed this character would in a jabillion years go to the trouble to do anything as old-fashioned as writing long detailed sing songy letters. Tedious."
2,Not very engaging,"First of all the letters format was just ok but I really found it boring to always hear it from Olivia's point of view and it was never in real time. Everything was always being dictated to you after the fact. Second I never really connected with the characters. They were quite dull. Even having a younger sister myself did not give this plot more emotion. I was quite glad to get through with it and move on to something better. I was hoping it would be a book to recommend to girlfriends and my sister but I doubt they would like it. Basically it was not uplifting or depressing, sad or happy, just neutral."
2,Journal format,I did not like the format this book was written in. I found it very boring. In fact it's the first book I haven't finished in TEARS! I gave it to someone else.
4,"good book to laugh, cry and think","I read this book on recommendation of a friend. I am usually not a fan of books written in the letter/fax/email style.Also the beginning just didn't strike me as something I would like from the ""Hollywood"" girly girl.But I was wrong, her delving into her sisters life and taking on responsibility and seeing things change, yet not completely loosing herself is well done. Everyone should be so lucky to have a sister like that."
2,Long Winded-Boring,The book contained so much ranting. Does not keep you involved in the story. What a waste.
3,Enjoyable and informative,"I found the description of her sister's experience with cancer very eye-opening as someone who's never had someone close to them go through it. It told me a lot but in a very enjoyable fashion. I was annoyed by all the reviews in the front cover that talk about what a great hollywood book it is, when I found it more of a book that talks about coping with illness, but in an engaging and light way. I also found the back cover description misleading. The letter format was enjoyable if you don't take it too seriously. I thought of it more as a clever way to show insight into the way people talk differently to different people than that they were literally letters she sent."
3,A Bunch of Letters + Sisterly Love = A Great Story!,"Nobody's perfect, and Olivia Hunt is a humorous and witty reminder of that! One letter from Olivia and you will fall in love with her style, her cunning, her wit, her sincerity, (or lack of)and her occasional appetite for a good argument! Her funny, emabarrassing, heart-breaking, and foolish adventures will make you laugh and cry throughout. A satisfying read."
3,I Need More,"I mostly blame myself for buying this book (yes, I fell for the cute cover and title--shame on me).When I opened the book I was disappointed to find that the book consists entirely of emails, faxes etc. When I read, I read--the way I eat a steak and not a steak sandwich. This trick has been done before with such authors as Meg Cabot and Celia A'Hearn. The only difference is Robinosn is an accomplished writer, and I look forward to a true work written bu her, a novel with paragraphs, dialogue and character development."
1,Mindbendingly Mediocre,"This is the story ( told in typical chic-lit conventions) about a creepy movie producer feeling guilt after the loss of a sister who she treated badly for years. The writing has quite a bit of nastiness and is mocking towards others, and is filled with second-rate plays at poetic metaphor. The format of presenting the book by way of one letter after another letter after another letter after another letter (all by the same person, by the way, and all with the same one-sided misery and sarcasm) finally wears one down. Most likely what we have here are a group of Robinson's actual journal entries, and/or copies of late night emails and letters she wrote during a period of upset, anger, and guilt-- now pasted together and rehashed as a ""book."" The best part of the book was the marketing. Second best part -- the cover."
4,sad but not sappy,"Heartbreaking but not at all sappy, this story of sisters is smart and funny. Ms. Robinson's cynicism is refreshing. Her take on Hollywood is interesting, and the honesty with which she creates her main character - letting us see her not-so-pretty thoughts - makes this book a cut above."
2,Didn't live up to hype,"I was anxious to read this book. Loved the cover, title and hype, but the book was dull. I stopped reading 20 pages before the end. I didn't care about the characters, the plot was so-so and the prose humdrum. It's a wonder how the author garnered so much prepub publicity. It's hard to believe it had had anything to do with the quality of the book, which was a midlist title at best.Want to read a book that lives up to some of the buzz? Try GOOD GRIEF by Lolly Winston."
2,It Helps When The Publisher Pours All Its Money Into Your PR,"For all the hype the publisher paid into and the sentimentalized reviews of ""you'll laugh, you'll cry""... when it comes down to it, the writing is hackneyed and amateurish. Quick fast sentences. Cynical nasty comments. A personal bravado about the main character's (ie, the author's) brilliance. This is most definitely no example of great literature. The letter format is also not as unique as the reviewers are attempting to pretend. It's been done in a more striking and literary way in other books-- as, for example, in The Color Purple. Last year's Ella Minnow Pea also gave the form some excitement. This is EZ reading and EZ writing. There is a show-offy quality to the author's name dropping of celebrities and a paint by numbers use of plot. Yes, you can read the book in a day. But the same can be true of People Magazine."
3,3.5 would be a better score...,"This is a touching novel, and I did have trouble putting it down, but at times the letter format gets old. I found myself longing for deeper character development. It's hard to glean that from this series of letters no matter how well-written and humourous they are."
4,"Entertaining, but the format does grow tiresome","Any author is certainly taking a risk by writing a novel soley in the format of letters written only by one character. It can be done successfully (try reading Fair and Tender Ladies by Lee Smith), but it can also run the risk of having a one-sided, self-centered feel as it sometimes does here. It's not that our main character is without merit. She's witty, smart and ferocious in her sister's defense. Some of my favorite letters were the one's written to her sister's medical team; the kind of letters we have all wanted to send, but never had the guts to. I did however find myself skimming through many of the letters, and I do agree with the other reviewers who noted that it just did not seem plausible that a globetrotting movie exec would be taking the time to write lengthy hand written letters. 3.5 stars"
3,Good by the end,"I bought this book after having gone through some loss in my own life. I was hoping for a deeper story. Although the book does go through the loss of someone while they are still alive (albeit dying), it seems to end abruptly. I felt that the humor throughout it was too forced and that the main character was so self-absorbed. Nonethless, the ending was redeeming and brought life back to this book."
4,An unexpected source of inspiration,Don't let the letter based style of the book deter you from reading it. I read this book fully expecting to become disinterested half way through because I expected a choppy format and the tragic tale of a dying sibling. Instead I found that I could not put this book down! The characters were engaging and real. The contrasts between the main character's life as a Hollywood producer and her best friend a suburban career mom were insightful. But the best surprise of this story is the inspiration and drive that was inspired from the main character's relationship with her sister. It made me wish that people really wrote letters like the ones in this book! ;-)
4,Polymorphous Peversity,"This novel is pure surrealism in prose. Blake is a dangerous, fast and loose running kid - falling out with his school masters for raping a sportsfield, failing at a series of jobs, he finally finds transcendence from the sterile bonds of society by stealing a plane and crashing it into the Thames at Shepperton. Believing himself dead, he undergoes a transformation and finds himself melding and soaring with the dormitory suburb of Shepperton (Ballard's hometown). Like some kind of winged messianic creature, he transforms the town into a surreal paradise with vines dripping from suburban street properties, and mysterious tropical plants blooming in the cornices. With his mercurial sperm, he mates with the entire town, flora and fauna alike, both possessing and dominating the climate, treating it as his plaything, leading to an apocalyptic and transcending climax: a complete fusion of the self with nature."
3,Mat science,The book was a little over priced knowing that there are already 2 newer editions. also when i got the book a lot of the pages were wet. the handling and shipping took longer than i expected. how ever the book has the topics that i need to study the newer does not chnage too much only the problems in back have different numbers or are slightly different.
4,Good Text,Very good book for material science introduction. Gives an overview about all different concepts. I think every materials engineer should have it
4,Great Tool,"Great introductory book. It built upon many of the concepts I had learned in my General Chemistry couses. Having previously worked in metal fabrication, I now learned what the metal specification numbers meant and why some types of metals are harder or softer than others."
3,"Okay, not great","Materials by Callister is a detailed, yet verbose book. I used it as a textbook for a 1st year Materials course at university, and while the book contains a lot of detail, most of it is contained within great slabs of written language, often without the aid of diagrams.This may be fine for senior undergraduate or postgraduate students, but for beginner students it simply isn't the way to teach a subject. My suggestions for future editions would be to tone down the language to a more basic level, and to include more diagrams to aid the student in conceptualisation."
4,Good/Great Textbook,"This textbook is nice in graphics and concept questions. However, I think that the text can be confusing at times. And as always, I wish they had MORE answers in the back of the book."
3,Material Science and Engineering,"The book was in excellent condition and I paid a good price. However, it was not what I thought it was - being a question and answer style college book. However, that was my fault.Still glad I bought it though"
2,Unbelivable,"I bought the game Fly. It took a very long time to learn how to play and even longer to install it. It's quiet good after all that, if you read the whole User Manual which is 288 pages of small sized letters and complicated notes you have to remember or at least remember the page number. If you don't the only way to move is if the gust speeds are high. Then your flipped over! Otherwhise, this game is a bomb. I don't recomend it. Now the graphics are good, but they're installed seperatly. It's okay to get, if you have .5 GB to spare. Same thing with the maps."
1,Overhyped.,"I expected a lot more from this game based upon the hype and box graphics. The graphics were OK, but performance was poor, the UI was clunky and it didn't seem to do a good job of modeling the physics of flight. (I was running on a 500 mHz G4, so I don't think it was a CPU power problem). Falcon 4.0 is much better (although very complicated to learn)"
1,Reved on hype,"Mr Tichy's book has a catchy title and an interesting cover. It also has..no, that's about all it has. Books containing anecdotes about leadership always run into the problem of being unoriginal. The combustable metaphor cannot save this book from being quite pedestrian. Try 'the art of leadership' if you want a book that hits quick and leaves a scar of wisdom"
2,Leadership for lightweights,"Even for an audiobook, this book is long-winded and insubstantial. There are no good ideas to be found here. There's nothing inherently wrong with the concept of creating leaders at every level of an organization, but his thesis does not reveal anything profound about leadership. And Tichy's examples don't seem well-chosen: he's obsessed with Jack Welch and GE. His treatment of Howard Gardner's Leading Minds is particularly bad considering that Leading Minds is a leadership classic. For those dissapointed with this book (as I was), I suggest Leaders: The Strategies For Taking Charge by Bennis and Nanus. It provides very good strategies for building a compelling vision for your company."
5,Group Facilitation,We're using this book as part of a leadership development program. 30 copies were sent directly to me on time and in perfect condition
2,"A dissapointing, simplistic approach to complex issues","I grew increasingly bored and disappointed with this book the more I read. Early in the book, Tichy seems to say something important, and I read with great interest. Quickly my enthusiasm waned, as I realized that many of those he cites as exemplary, such as Eckhard Pfeiffer at Compaq and Dick Notebaert at Ameritech, are not the great success stories he makes them out to be. Pfeiffer was booted out of Compaq and Ameritech is now merging with SBC. Perhaps it's an occcupational hazard with authors of business books that they risk seeing their best examples of success go down in flames shortly after their books are published. In any case, this one is skippable."
2,"Good anecdotes, but ultimately lacks substance","This is a difficult book to get through, not because it is complex but because it lacks depth. It's like eating a grain of rice at a time - it takes longer to get anything out of it than you are willing to get through. The anecdotes are fine and were the most useful parts of the book, but ultimately the book's original ideas failed to inspire.One thing that drove me nuts is the number of times the author used the word ""leader"" per page. I get it: this is a book on leadership, the nurturing of leaders within an organization, how companies who foster the development of leaders perform, and the importance of recognizing someone's leadership potential (see, now I'm doing it)."
2,Not what I expected,"""The Leadership Engine"" is a 'rapid-read' book but is to basic for my needs. The contents merely touches on leadership topics and fails to provide enough information to be a valuable resource."
2,Real difficult to work with,"The magnifier works, but by using the same hand to squeeze, the magnifier moves on you and then you lose track of where the hair is... very difficult to manage."
1,very awkward,"The magnifying lens seemed like a good idea, until I tried to use these tweezers. It gets in the way so much that I just moved it out of the way to use. I wish there was a way to get the tweezers out of the plastic casing so that I could use them without the magnifying lens."
3,Another good one,This next book in the series picks up right where the last one ended. It shows the hardships of their life in the North in a realistic manner that everyone can relate to.
3,Janette Oke book 3,What can I say? I haven't got to this book yet. I'm still reading the first book. I'll probably get to it after Christmas.
4,Nice read,I liked the book for the most part. It was slightly annoying at times though with how the main character never progressed in the life she was living.
5,wonderful,Thanks so much for the # 3 book.I recieved it promptly and enjoyed it.Will probaly pass on to my daughter.
3,Still disappointing,With the introduction of Elizabeth in book #1 I enjoyed the simple life she was showing and treading along in her new areas of wonder but...When Comes the Spring was a follow up of a lot of crying. When Breaks the Dawn follows with the crying and whining. It became tiring and I was hoping she would finally pull her chin up and cope better but it just didn't appear she was made for the area.
5,"Delightful, beautifully performed music.","I serendipitiously came across this CD while looking for something else, and after listening to a few excerpts, I found myself entranced by the sounds. I have to admit I had never heard of Milladoiro before, but I'm totally sold. The beautiful Celtic sounds, stamped with an unmistakeably Spanish flavor in many of the traditional Galician numbers, is simply entrancing."
2,Short shelf life,"Our latest Coleman stove was only 2 years old when the regulator wouldn't allow the canisters to attach to it anymore. Apparently from other reviews, the part that goes into the canisters gets bent after a while and has to be replaced. Our old stoves lasted about 25-30 years apiece with no problems until they finally developed leaks in the tubing. The new regulators are a problem for everyone, but apparently other brands of camping stoves are no better unless you want to spend about $500 and have a heavy, bulky stove. So, we purchased two more regulators so we will have a spare when the first one fails and not have to cut short another camping trip due to a bad part. Cheap, cheap, cheap. China, China, China."
2,Coleman Stove Pipe,"I needed this replacement because the original propane stove pipe's threads wore out. Coleman recommends, and I agree, that the canister should be removed when not in use, thus increasing the number of times that the threads get used. However, it seems that the pipe's threads are not as hard as the steel propane bottle's threads and thus the wear factor is high with continued use. I will continue to use caution and care on threading a propane cylinder into the pipe's fitting, and, of course, making sure that I do not cross-thread the unit. Perhaps Coleman could up the quality and hardness of its pipe's fitting to lessen the wear factor."
2,manufacturing engineer,"Plane and simple....the regulator connection to the grill dont fit.... ( regu. connection is too small. This regulator is none adjustable.I entered the make and model of my table top coleman grill, amazon came up with this regulator. Its totally the wrong one.. Really... how does that happen, how do i return it for the correct regulator???Colin hungry in Wisconsin...."
2,cute...but they run small,"These are really cute, but don't believe the size charts, they run small! I wear a 6 at old navy and thought based on the size chart here that would translate out to a medium...I was wrong! These were so tight on my hips that it was uncomfortable. I figure that I need at least a large for them to fit right...oh well, at least they were super cheap so I didn't waste much money."
2,Decent Sound but poor quality,"My brother and I have been playing trumpet now for many years. We both have used many mutes, but this one seemed to be the best deal for our personal collection. The Mute works great for about one year, but then falls apart. There is no piece to hold the cup part on, so after awhile, the straight mute stays in the trumpet, but the cup part falls out."
3,There are better options,"For being able to be used as both a straight mute, a cup mute, and even a wah-wah effect mute, this is one of the only options. However, the corks have a bad habit of falling off, and the tone created is not the most desired. Buy if on a budget, but if you can spare, there are better brands for straight and cup mutes"
2,Not the answer to all your credit card problems,"As an employee of a major credit card company, I was very excited to see if this book really supplied the information any credit card user needs to know. Don't misunderstand me, I am on the consumer's side. The problem with this book is that doesn't really tell the consumer the most important things about interest rates. Credit cards aren't about interest rates. There are more twist and turns a company can use to make money on you besides the interest rate or finance charges. This book barely touched this subject, and actually encouraged the reader to look for the lowest rate card instead of saying,""Don't worry about the rate, you shouldn't carry a balance anyway!"" Its a good book for understanding your rights as far as disputing credit card charges and understanding credit law. I wouldn't recommend the book if you are looking for all the answers, this book only answered a couple of the many questions surrounding credit cards."
5,Thank God for this book!,"I've had a very hard time with a debit card transaction recently, and it's still ongoing. If it weren't for the fact that I bought this book when it was first published (1999) and read it cover to cover, I might have a harder time still, and be unable to prove my case in court. The techniques within the book--keeping records of who, what, and when; knowing what your rights are and how to go about defending them; be polite while doing so--have helped me very much over the past three months. Phew! Strong's book is a jewel to be gripped tightly and passed on from generation to generation. I am definitely making this a must-read for my parents, brothers, and sisters, too!"
4,Stand up for your rights against credit card companies,"The author presents an adversarial relationship with credit card companies. Along with presenting explanations on how these companies operate, the author presents steps needed to resolve problems with a credit card user's account and the ways these companies try to foil the user. A pretty decent book on a subject near and dear to all our hearts."
1,This battery is not charging at all !,"I am unable to charge the battery, it is defected !Although it shows that I am giving 1 star, it's only because it's not allowing me to give 0 stars !"
5,Heavy Angels,"Being from Australia,It is almost impossible to imagine the music landscape without The Angels.I saw them at least three times as teenager,and for whipping a crowd into a state of frenzy with great music that is also possessed of intellect these guys are nearly impossible to better.Why it is that a band as good as The Angels does not make it any bigger is one of those mystery's that cannot be solved even more so when you are faced with a catalogue of music that is so potent.Buy this and i am sure you will want more,A great,great band anywhere that you may hear them.Ian."
4,It's a very sad story,I love the way O'Henry writes his stories. He's really skilfull in touching peoples souls in two pages or so.
2,Correction on Review of Texas Forts History,"Upon re-reading the book's section on Presdio de Los Adaes, I did find the a few sentances relating to the history of the fort on page 41. I want to correct myself and clarify that the book does have some text related to the drawing on page 42. It is not enough to satisfy my own desire for historical information.The book also presents a nice overlay map of historic Fort Stockton and its present location in the present-day Fort Stockton, Texas.I would also like to state that however disappointing the book was to me from my own historical scholar's viewpoint, ""An Illustrated History of Texas Forts"" would be nice reading for those who are interested in a less-detailed history of the state's forts. It would be good reading for those buyers who have a casual interest in Texas fort history and would suffice as a nice gift for them."
5,Excellent,"I liked the product, very good quality.I recommend it.Very good to care.Very quick in responding to requests.very quick dispatch.products are economical."
3,good side bad side,".. There is some very cool photography here, especially of implantation and the early weeks of fetal development. There's also a lot of boring non-expert talking head stuff (this expectant couple loves to tango!!), and disappointingly little science. The cursory handling of meiosis is as complex as it gets. Regarding the advertised new take on the gender politics in the fertilization story: yes, they have eliminated the whole 'mighty sperm penetrates the egg' narrative, but the alternative introduces its own new gender based anthropomorphism of these single cells ('the egg is guarded by watchful chaperones...')It also features a strangely abrupt ending - it says something about the last 2/3rds of pregnancy being uneventful ..) and then pretty much cuts to the end. So, buy it if you want to glean the 6-7 minutes of cool photography, but don't expect much more."
4,We thought it was okay for our kid to watch,"Honestly- I think I liked the original better, but uncertain ifi would show that version to my child. But- We watched this with our 7.5 year old after he came home and described snake reproduction, learned from a book on reptiles at school. I felt momentarily uncomfortable with the birthing scene at the end. This, the image of a human head emerging from female genitalia was not recognizable to him (he thought it was her stomach) and required a brief explanation. It wasn't easy for me, but parenting requires being the grown up sometimes, doesn't it? The scene seemed brief to the former version and seemed less painful for the woman- at least in my foggy memory of it. Some kids might get bored, but our son is into science/nature shows and this fits right in with those interests. Too young? No- he's not. In fact this is a good time to be discussing sex & reproduction- when it is nothing more than factual material and a little bit gross, too :)!"
5,Monk-Key Business,"Madsen's Monk tribute (""Sphere Essence"", Playscape Recordings) is nothing short of spectacular. He may have exhausted the physical and conceptual limits of piano jazz with this effort. Without exception, his interpretations are fresh, energized and powerful. Getting beyond Madsen's overwhelming display of technical proficiency, I found each track deeply musical to the point of being hypnotic - and always true to Monk's original concept.The recording is A+ from the perspective of sound fidelity, too. The listener is placed in perfect proximity to the piano, which is perfectly in tune and sounds like it must be the world's finest instrument.With ""Sphere Essence,"" Madsen has raised the bar on Monk interpretations so high that they are likely never to be equaled, nor the attempt made to do so."
4,Great children's book,"The basic writing style and simplistic plot in this small to medium sized book was perfect for my two children, ages 5 and 9, to comprehend. My youngest one, Peabody, would love a Jimmy Streets talking doll! I hope there is an illustrated version of this book on the way."
1,No good ideas,"I didn't think there were any good ideas in here at all. You can come up with better games based on Bible stories on your own.For example, for 2-3 year olds, the game for David & Goliath was write on 2 pieces of paper the words ""Big"" & ""Little"" and then have kids find the big and little stuff in the room. Instead, tell the story, then have an adult be Goliath and the kids each get 5 marshmallows to throw at Goliath. It teaches the story better and is a physical game."
2,"Games for Infants, Toddlers & Preschoolers","This book has a couple of good games but, I was looking for more activities for Toddlers and Preschoolers which were not very many good ideas."
3,HMMMM....,"I think Mya's got a great voice, and she knows how to ""make you dance"", as one of her tracks boasts, but when it comes to slow jams, she's got a lot to learn. What's up with all that ""I hope you die, I hope you die..."" in that song? She's got psychotic tendencies, but she knows how to jam!"
5,"She can sing and, can dance","I think Mya is one of the best girl singers out. I think Mya's style is great and different. She sounds different from Brandy, Monica , Aaliyah. Mya keep doing good"
3,I thought it would be great....,"I thought this cd was cool but I was a little disappointed with the variety in the songs. They weren't as good as I thought. Nothing against Mya, she's a VERY talented artist, but I thought she could have been more grown up in her lyrics. She seemed like she was talking about the same thing in every song. But the cd is still very cool and I would still recomend it."
1,Myas not that great,"Mya's album s**ks. She can't dance,she defintly can't sing,and she can't write songs.She self centered and her music reflects that.Like ""if you died i woundn't cry cuz you never really loved me"" how much more concited can you get.She has what sounds like a puffy sample in track 4.in it all about me she has some lines loudly and some u can bearly hear and that is not a good combo. the balads s**k. This is what i think but many people agree with me. If you wanna get a good album get domething by Mariah Carey,brandy,N 'sync,mase,or shaina twain"
4,Da Bomb!,"I really like this cd by mya. My fav songs are ""If you died I wouldn't cry cause you never loved me anyway"" and My first night with you. I'm going to her concert and I think this album is awsome!"
4,Mya is movin up,"I really enjoyed this CD. My two favorite songs are It's all about me and Movin on. My first night with you is sweet and make you dance is pretty cool too!! To all the people who wrote negative vibes, If you can't say anything nice, don't say anything at all. She is my twin and I can't tolerate cheap shots."
4,GREAT DEBUT,"I've always been a fan of Mya. I think she's one of the most talented female artist in entertainment today that is overlooked. Not only can she sing but girlfriend can dance. I'm glad that she's now getting into the acting scene. This us surely her best album to date. FEAR OF FLYING and MOODRING are solid albums but cannot compare to her debut. If Mya gets the credit she deserves as an entertainer, she will be unstoppable."
2,"::Shaking Head:: Mya, Mya, Mya, Mya...","Average, run-of-the-mill, and rushed: these are the words that describe Mya's self-titled debut. There are a few stand-out tracks, but mostly filler. The album loses it's luster, vibrancy, and life after a couple of spins. It's one of those CDs that (after a month) will sit on your bookcase and collect dust. Recommended if desperate."
3,kinda sorta snoozing,"This CD is kinda slow. Nothing really stands out about it. The only songs I really enjoy are Movin On and All About Me. Maybe over time, the others will grow on me :)"
3,Mya-No One Does It Better,"This album is smooth and hot I like it! Some of the songs on the album are generic but with songs like ""Baby It's Yours"" how can ya go wrong!"
5,I LOVE MY CD!,"I bought this cd last year and I love it. Not to many people knew about Mya and I loved it. My favorite song is ""It's all about me"". I love the beat and all. Every other song on the cd are great also. Mya is awesome!"
4,"Great c.d, JUST ONE THING BUGS ME...","Hey! I enjoy Mya`, don't get me wrong, but the one song I cannot stand is ""KEEP ON LOVIN' ME"" Hey, isn't that ""ALL ABOUT THE BENJAMINS"" in the background? Other then that, I love the c.d."
1,"Sorry, but this CD was not good",This CD was very disappointing she only had a couple of good songs on here...this cd has been collecting dust the day after I bought it. I hope the next album will be a whole lot better than this one.
1,Save your money.,"I thought this was a great idea at first. And it did work for a while. But then the teflon coating wore away very fast and the pancakes began sticking and burning.The only good thing I got out of it was the little pancake pour spout. It does make perfect pancakes. If they don't stick, that is.I was using it for scrambled eggs. But even that use is gone. If you want good pancakes that don't stick and burn, get a small farberwear frying pan. Costs less and NOTHING sticks to it.The commercial for this goes *You flip, but they flop.* Sorry guys. But perfect pancake is a flop. :(*Wal-Mart couldn't even sell the set at $4.00 because no one wanted it.*"
2,Bored already,"I stupidly listened to AMAZON reviewers compare this to 'Tortoise' and say Tied and Tickled Trio surpasses their talent. Well, whoever wrote that review certainly isnt a musician, and i would never be their friend because their advice had me pick this album up. What begins as something perhaps interesting slowly begins to dawn on you that the time signiatures are in 4/4, and this is of the more sophmoric avant jazz groups out there. you simply can't compare this to 'tortoise', 'savath and savalas' or 'e.s.t.'. Morr music usually is correct but they missed the boat on these guys. Their other album ARC is barely better, but after two or three listens, its a no-go. Bo-ring."
5,Indispensable,This is a truly indispensable guide-- I keep one at every site where I work (I am a primary care nurse practitioner). I highly recommend it for any health care provider!
4,All the ID answers you could ever want,"The sanford guide has a wealth of information in it, but it takes some time to become familiar with its organization."
5,GORGEOUS,These are top quality and absolutely GORGEOUS!! I get great compliments on them and they dress up a table so nicely. They clean really good too. Can't go wrong with these Lenox Napkins as far as I'm concerned.
1,Color not as displayed; stickers difficult to remove,These are not the pretty taupe color shown in the picture but instead a somewhat putrid pale yellow. Each napkin has a sticker attached as part of the packaging. The adhesive used for the sticker is very difficult to remove causing much of the sticker to remain on the napkin when you try to remove it for the first laundering.
3,Almost great,"I love the cards, but need to know what is on the inside of the cards. The message is very important to me when I send cards, and I feel like I'm missing half the card."
5,"Solid, heavy, nice finish","These switch plates are excellent quality--the nice, heavy ones. The finish is really nice, too. My old funky kitchen looks a lot nicer just by changing out the outlet covers and switch plates. The satin nickel finish doesn't scream ""look at me"" but coordinates beautifully with the stainless steel appliances."
5,"Wonderful product, wonderful price!",Very good against cat smells! I feel I will buy this product again in the future. I hope this company never stops making this wonderful product!
2,Does not clump well for multi cats,I have two cats and scoop every other day. Super scoop works better and traps odor better. Something about the Multicat just doesn't clump together as well.
1,Doesn't block odor,I have two small kittens and this litter doesn't hold up. Doesn't block odor and makes a mess when the kittens exit the litter box. Particles are all over the outside of the litter box. Will never order again!!!!
3,Watch the sizing,"Contrary to what another reviewer stated, I did NOT find that the sizes ran big. If anything, I would say the opposite. MEASURE YOURSELF FIRST! I wear size 10 clothing and ordered a medium. (I am 5'5"" and 5-10 pounds overweight.) I should had ordered a LARGE! I often have this problem with anything made in Asia but this was made in Mexico. (Is anything made in the USA anymore??)"
2,Disappointment,"As advertised, this is light, fairly easy to put on (you just wrap it around yourself and touch the ends of the velcro to one another). Please note that it does NOT fasten with hooks, but just this huge strip of velcro. However, as I wear a lot of knits, this item is going to be of no use -- there is a 5 x 7"" strip of velcro just sitting there across my tummy waiting to ruin my clothes. I've spent the money now, and will have to try to find something else. As I said, a disappointment. Strange that no one else has mentioned this. If you wear knits, do not purchase this item unless you plan to wear a whole additional layer of clothing between the support belt and the knit clothing."
5,OUTSTANDING,"Ordered and recieved it in much less than advertised shpping schedule, and this during the Christmas rush. I have enjoyed the cd and would recommend it to anyone."
2,Boring,"Every song has the same cadence. I mean every song sounds the same. The musicianship is great. But throw in a slow song every now and then. Instead, buy ""28 Dulcimer Classics"" by the Nashville Dulcimers at Amazon. Its cheaper and a better selection of tunes played by experts."
5,A Joy of Listening!,"Besides an excellent slection of music, from the contrapuntal brilliance of Palestrina, Tallis, and Gibbons, to the sensuous emotion of Schutz and Leo, this recording features the beautiful sound of the Voices of Ascension; I had not previously heard of them, but have come to find they are at the top of the worldwide choral landscape. Their delicate balance and wonderfully smooth sound challenges even the Tallis Scholars in the performance of Renaissance music, which, more than the music of any other period, requires these two attributes. They demonstrate their vocal virtuosity in pieces like ""Hosanna to the Son of David"" and ""Exsultate Deo"", but also their ability to gently blend in works such as ""If Ye Love Me"" and ""Ave Verum Corpus"". This album surely ranks among the top of current Renaissance recordings."
4,A great beginning album of Renaissance music!,"This CD is well-executed overall, with some of the more well-known treasures of the Renaissance period, as well as some composers that are not as often mentioned. It contains a wonderful variety of songs. The singing is done very well,although it is not my absolute favorite. My one complaint is that it does not include any of the texts, nor does it really seek to do justice to the history behind these pieces; perhaps it was limited by a tight budget. All the same, I most certainly do not regret purchasing this CD. My favorite track is the first, Palestrina's Sicut Cervus."
5,I have the book and DVD,"Ok. If you don't have the DVD with the book or vice versa, you will not recieve the full benefit of learning to play classical guitar on your own.This book will not replace a classical guitar teacher but it will give novices plenty of important information to build a foundation with classical guitar.The DVD stresses sitting position, hand position, and notes on a scale.The DVD referencing from the book also has a play along duet with Scot Tenant the instructor. So you will learn sight reading, counting, rythm, and musical notation.The book will not give too much detail on fretboard layout, scales and an encyclopedia of chords. And it will not discuss the Theory of Music such as circle of fifths. You will discover those things later.Its an excellent book/DVD for someone with no classical guitar background or any music background."
3,Nice Job,Using this book has helped me to rule out or include winter species I wasn't sure about in the Portland area. You need a picture type bird identifier with it.
4,Must read before Infinite Crisis but..,but unfortunately isnt done justice when it comes to wrapping this all up in Infinite Crisis. I shouldve just stopped at this book and given it an ending in my head.
4,The Lead Up To Infinite Crisis,"I haven't read the other tie in books to countdown to infinite crisis but they actually seem like tie ins to this event. This book has the main part of the other story where Superman and Wonder Woman fight. They mention the other books like the war with thangar and the society of villains but they aren't expanded on. I enjoyed the book a lot and my only real problem with it is that I don't understand why Batman was keeping track of the other heroes, even though I don't know a lot about him I really liked Blue Beetle and surprisingly Booster Gold (The only other story I read with him was 52 where he was a jerk) Another problem is that the little intro makes it seemed like you missed something important like you walk in a hour to a movie and you kind of have to catch up to what has happened. This is a very thick book and despite my nitpicks its really good."
5,Dang Good!,"SOme say that this is not 'easy' to swallow if you're a causal reader. Well, of course not. You have to read 4 more books in order for you to understand the whole scope the entire narrative.But I like this book, and how Batman is portrayed. Paranoia at it's best, and the downfall of a legacy/partnership is hard to read, only because it's total chaos..in a good way."
5,UNIQUE RESOURCE FOR YOUTH MARKETERS!,"Now THIS is the kind of book I've been looking for. Something written with businesspeople in mind. Well organized, full of case studies, just the right mix of stats. Not only is this the only book of its kind, trust me -- I've been looking for this type of book everywhere! -- it even has a stamp of approval from top execs at General Motors, Best Buy, Sony Music, etc. Fascinating book that is both highly educational as well as a great read."
4,Amazon versus Xerox,"When you gotta have it, you gotta have it. However, we found it cheaper directly from Xerox.Please recycle - the manufacturer makes it easy."
4,Content is better than the papers,I was pretty disappointed when I just received this book. The papers were kind of like newspaper. Maybe that is what paperback means. But the content is so interesting and thought provoking that I couldn't put it down. I would like to recommend it to my friends.
2,Disappointed expectations,"I bought the book because of the back cover promise of ""a beautiful book that lifts the spirit,"" written by a professor of Italian fiction and poetry at Johns Hopkins. What is M. Scott Peck doing as the authority on page 4? The renunciation of Dante comes on page 7, ""One day, while lecturing on the Divine Comedy, I looked at my students and realized that I wanted them to be kind human beings more than I wanted them to know about Dante."" If the book had been written as an essay for the etiquette section of a men's magazine, my opinion may have been positive, but I was simply not expecting a lightweight book of dos-and-donts.According to the forward, ""Civility is a wonderfully effective tool to enhance the quality of our lives."" If you are looking for life quality enhancement tools, this book may be for you."
4,Very good book!,"To be quite honest I had to buy this book for a class we are required to take for graduation called Exploring Diversity. Quite frankly I would never have given this book a second thought without taking this class. This book is so very informative, well written and teaches all of us that even though we may think that we are diverse beings without prejiduce of any form, step back, look and think again. This book will teach you about yourself and how to be the person you strive to be."
3,"A good, humorous diversion. Fun!","Eddie Murphy is a very funny guy, and he holds this movie together. He depicts the famous Dr. Dolittle, whose claim to fame is that he talks to animals. Not just SOME animals, but to ALL animals. As if they all talk the same language--English, of course.The movie is apparently a frank propaganda piece for Earth First! but that's okay, because it is still funny and good entertainment.The villain, a timber baron of course, brags that he took on the Democrats and so he should be able to handle Dr. Dolittle-- implying that he is a Republican, for certainly all Republicans are villains and all villains are Republicans.Even so, it was a funny movie. One must simply ignore the green garbage message and enjoy it. As someone recently said, ""A rattlesnake loose in the living room tends to end all discussion of animal rights.""Joseph H. Pierre"
4,Who says sequels don't get better?,"As a 19 year-old with 3 younger brothers, I would say that it's worth getting this movie just to watch the hysterical reactions of younger kids. Thing is, I found it almost as funny myself!Surprisingly, this turned out to be better (in my opinion) than the first Dr. D.There are times when the actions of the animals don't seem to fluidly match their speech and intended emotions, but hey, it's to be expected. As is typical with a movie intended for the younger generation, there is plenty of bodily humor, though some of the narrative almost borders on the adult when referring to sex. It never goes overboard though, and while it may never become a classic in the sense of the book, you'll end up with a contented sigh by the time the film comes to an end."
4,Funnier than the first one !,"I liked it better than the first one, and frankly not too many comedy sequels can topped the original. Eddie Murphy is charming as the Doctor. In this, he is trying to save the forest from being chopped down by nasty developer. The performances are great and enhanced to the movie cuteness.The DVD is fine, several extra features included. The picture and sound quality is about average nothing to complain about. Overall, this DVD will delight your entire family. REcommended."
3,average movie,saw this movie in theater in my opinon wasn`t nearly as good as dr.dolittle. Still a lot better than others.
4,Good Family movie,Good movie but the first is still our favorite. Still s great clean movie that you can enjoy with your kids
3,THEY SPEAK THE SAME LANGUAGE,"This is a moderately entertaining film that is fun for the whole family. It features Eddie Murphy as Dr. Dolittle, reprising his original role. This time Dr. Doolittle displays an interest in environmental issues, as he tries to save the forest by playing matchmaker between Ava, a bear in the wild, and Archie, a circus bear who has gotten soft and is trying to get used to living in the wild. Ultimately, Dr. Dolittle is victorious over the corporate expansionists who sought to decimate the forest.There are some very amusing moments with the animals. There are also some funny moments as Dr. Dolittle tries to cope with his sixteen year old daughter just being a teenager. Much to his delight and surprise, however, it turns out that she appears to have inherited his unique ability to communicate with animals. Still, this film is simply not as good as the prequel."
5,Doolittle does it again!,"We loved the first movie, so when the 2nd came out, it had a lot to live up to. It was as hysterical as the first... very well done! A ""must"" have!!"
3,Dr. Dolittle 2,"The movie ""Dr.Dolitle"" was a movie directed by Steve Carr which both childen and adults will like it.It was a very interesting movie because a doctor call Dolittle was able to communicate with animals.Dr.Dolittle had to make a type of endangered bear to give birth in order to save the forest where many types of species of animalss lived in. But at first, the male bear was anti-social not romantic and do not know how to survive in the wild, it was very playful and likes to sing songs which sounded terrible. So it was long before they began to fall for each other, as the female bear was actually attached.The movie was very funny when the male bear was climbing on a broken tree branch, which had a bee hive. He just wanted to fulfil the female bear's wish in being a courageous bear. Dr. Dolittle advised him not to climb.Andwhen the bear reached the top,the bees in the hive stinged them.Overall, I would give the movie 3 out of 5.1h and 28minPG"
3,THEY SPEAK THE SAME LANGUAGE...,"This is a mildly entertaining film that is fun for the whole family. It features Eddie Murphy as Dr. Dolittle, reprising his original role.

2,Mildly Entertaining.,"This is another Family friendly movie, that my 3 littlest ones just didn't take to. About have way through, 2 of the 3 were asking to put on Homeward bound instead. There was a lot I liked about this movie, but my family voted with their feet and remote control. They are 6 to 10 years old."
5,Hebrew-English Concordance to the Old Testament,Outstanding help with the NIV Exhaustive Concordance. It really helps to see how a word is translated throughout the NIV and therefore to understand the fuller meaning of that word.
4,Gorgeous Wall Feature,I had this poster matted and framed for my baby's first Christmas present. The colors are fantastic and the subtle Winnie-the-Pooh Characters tie it into the rest of her room. It's unique and beautiful.
5,Still great listening 36 years later,"I still have the original albums and many of my friends have been lectured to (by me) of the essential nature of the song ""Cold November."" That Delbert McClinton song in particular that has served as antidepressant, sense-of-humor recharger since I was 21 1n 1972. They're all great!!"
3,untitled,"i purchased the album the day it was released and was highly dissapointed. the material seems more like a follow up to an all america rejects cd. it's good but definatly not what you would expect. it lacks the energy of the bands previous release start static. stand out tracks are memory, crying, champagne, and what you say. she's the blade is an okay track but repetative. back to california isn't very good, and the rest of the cd is too emo-ish.i suppose if it would have been a good effort if it had come before start static, but as a follow up isn't what you'd expect. there are no tracks as good as your the one, stuck in america, daddy's little defect or how does it feel. if you liked bouncing off the walls again or pretty girl (the way) beware because it doesn't resemble anything on this cd."
5,this one definitely does not disappoint!,"sugarcult's new cd is a little less pop-y, which i personally am very glad about! i can directly relate to most of the songs, which i love! they definitely tapped into a more serious side and musically they still rock! i always get worried when bands come out with their follow up albums, but this one does not disappoint. they changed just enough that it is not boring but not enough to sound totally different. i love this cd!"
2,ok i suppose,"Being a huge fan of Sugarcult in the past, I find this cd very disappointing. They've gotten out of their sort of edgy style and gone for a much more pop punk sound. This cd is too sell-outish for me to really enjoy it and I really hope I don't start hearing all the little 13 year old girls that ""looooooove Simple Plan soooo much"" obsessing over Sugarcult as their new sell-out band of the month."
4,Better than the previous release,"After being burnt out on Sugarcult only a few weeks after hearing their first release, I bought this thinking ""Memory"" was going to be the only worthwhie songs. I was wrong. I really like a lot of songs on here and I'm glad I bought it. I only gave it a 4 because it seems like I've heard some of these songs somewhere before, and as much as I like Sugarcult, this isn't exactly groundbreaking material."
4,a very good CD,Palm Trees and power lines is a good transition CD. If you liked Start Static you may like this CD. In my opinion it is more grown up and meaningful. This 12 track cd has extra tour footage and Ringtones. I just got it a few hours ago and i already love it!!
4,Sugarcult goes back to their roots,"Sugarcult's new cd hits harder then their previous start static while still maintaining their reputation for addictive hooks. Sugarcult's new album has an edgier sound on their sophmore album with parallels to their first ep ""wrap me up in plastic"", which include deviations from the anthematic singles off their first record. Their new cd has diverse sounding guitars and a more apparent rock inffluence. If you loved the pop aspect of their first record you won't be dissapointed, you can still sing along and bounce ""off the walls"", but for listeners looking for growth and maturation on their new release, you will find that too. Definatly worth checking out."
2,Not so Great,"I was expecting huge things from this album being a suguarcult fan. But i majorly disspointed. This cd with a exception of a few songs is very bland and boring. All the songs sound extremley similar. It sounded like one big song with a few exceptions. I think suguarcult is should stick to more catchy upbeat songs then slower songs, because thats what they do best. Maybe this cd will grow on me more but i highly doubt. Hopefully suguarcult will come out with a better cd next time. Later."
3,Ok cd....but nothing new....,"I have to say this cd is an improvement from their last, which had too many slow songs but it's nothing new. This cd starts out with ""she's the blade"" which basically sounds like any other pop-punk band out there and is nothing new. Number 2 ""Crying"", I really do like because the sound is solid and I like it when Tim kinda screams at the end over and over, that's cool. This cd does have highlight songs like, crying, champagne, and counting stars. Those are the best songs. I can't stand #4 or #10, which are really annoying songs that don't truly fit on this cd. This cd is ok, and is better than start static, so if you're into pop-punk, you'll like it, I'm pretty sure you will. enjoi."
4,memory...great stuff,"ill give the ""4 stars"" to ""memory"" and ""shes the blade""..the rest isnt that great,,but hey, Start static was good!"
5,Palm Trees and Power Lines: Are 2 cds better than one?,"Sugarcult's Palm Trees and Power Lines is more of what Sugarcult fans love. Even for those who have never heard of Sugarcult, it's still a really good CD. A must have."
3,"Its no ""start static""...","but its still good. Maybe its just because I like the poppy stuff better, but in my opinion, they were hit just slightly by the infamous sophmore slump..."
4,Palm Trees and Power Lines is a smash,Sugarcult's new album Palm Trees and Power Lines is a great cd. i love listening to the new sounds of sugarcult. The cd is alot mellower then there first. With this one they have mature with there music. I have alot of favorite songs i love to rock out to and there are some songs that you just listen to when your in a relaxing mood.
4,Pretty good,"Well if you were expecting another start static, this isn't it. Sugarcult has kind of gone more rockish now that the ""pop-punk"" fad has died away. I see a resemblance of their older cd, wrap me up in plastic. There is only one faster song but the slower songs and harmonies as heard in memory are very catchy and likeable. After a while the songs start sounding the same too. I actually prefer start static but if you hate pop-punk music, you'll probably enjoy this cd a lot better. To compare this to another band, compare mest's destination unknown to their new self-titled cd. Thats about how start static and palm trees and power lines works out. Overall I would still suggest buying this cd."
3,"Sugarcult ""Palm Trees And Power Lines""","""She's The Blade"" 4/5""Crying"" 4/5""Memory"" 5/5""Worst December"" 3/5""Back To California"" 3/5""Destination Anywhere"" 4/5""Champagne"" 4/5""What You Say"" 3/5""Over"" 3/5""Head Up"" 4/5""Counting Stars"" 3/5""Sign Off"" 3/5""Palm Trees And Power Lines,"" the sophomore effort from rockers Sugarcult is a little dissapointing. This is not to say that the album is horrible, it's just not great compared to their amazing debut, ""Start Static."" There are more slow paced songs on this record, which is not the band's strong point. Highlights include ""Memory,"" ""She's The Blade,"" and ""Champagne.""Overall rating: Three and a half stars."
3,Interesting complex/winding storyline without an obvious end,"Intriguing how the story unfolds from an oddly spellbinding accident to a more psychologically complex plot. It was good, but not great."
2,The story didn't leave anything to me.,"Too bad... This was one of a few books I got to read on my Christmas vacation. I was hungry for good stories, but this was a disappointment. The first chapter is fine, but the rest of the story is highly unrealistic."
2,Plodding and over didactic,"Parts of this book are very well done - certainly most of the first scene is. But overall this book is weak for two reasons. First, it simply spouts too much theory and scientific philosophy - all or most of which seems to have been culled from popular science books and magazines. It's fine, it's reasonable, but you can find better in the New Scientist or Scientific American. This goes for the main phenomenon of the book: the psychological complaint from which the Jed character suffers. Second, the style is tremendously bland, as if color and wit are somehow beneath this author. Overall, it's a plodding and unstylish read, with too much borrowed material. There are plenty of better novels around."
3,Wonderful writing&#65533;mind gymnastics,"The beginning of the book is beautifully written. The vocabulary is a real treat. There are lots of words with more than one or two syllables...nice for a change, eh? It's a compelling scene, this balloon accident. But then it gets kind of boring...pedantic literary stuff. Made me contemplate reading Keats, though. Fortunately, it's short enought that you aren't making an extraordinary commitment. Just get in there and enjoy the mind exercise...gives you a really feeling of superiority to those who are selecting the insulting best-sellers. The famous British humor doesn't seem to surface until the very very end....and I was waiting for it."
3,"you know you love this book, dont deny it","""Enduring Love"" works fantastic most of the time when protagonist Joe Rose is in action sequences, battling off the advances of a psychopath, but slows down too much for this reader when it goes into lecture mode, as the author often does in all of his novels. All in all I enjoyed it, and mildly recommend it. Great premise, great characters, just gets a little tedious at times."
5,For those who doubt the plot,"I wondered by some people rated this book with just one star, and it appears that one consistent criticism is that the character and plot seem - ""unbelievable"" to paraphrase the comments.It appears these critics didn't read the appendix.The syndrome referenced in the story is well documented. A case history, which I assume is valid although not referenced in the notes, shows the basis of the story.Clearly the amazing thing here is how bizarre our behavior can become when the brain doesn't function ""normally"".It turns out that the story is merely a reflection of life, albeit life that most us would never encounter.For my own opinion the five stars says it all - masterful."
4,Wonderful work by the great McEwan,"You simply can't go wrong with any fiction by the supreme English writer of the day, Ian McEwan. Though not quite as good as ""Atonement"", this one was terrific and is short enough that it can be read in two or three sittings, as most of his works can be. I made it a point not to read the jacket beforehand, so the plot was a surprise. McEwan in all his books uses ""love, faith, and suspense"" to weave a wonderful tapestry. Thanks to him."
4,Good Read,"""Enduring Love"" is well-written, and the story is unique. It's plot-driven, but not a page-turner. The lack of a highly sympathetic character decreased my reading pleasure.That Parry's syndrome involves his faith may be thematically important. Perhaps McEwan is hinting that like Parry, those with religious faith are investing energy in an object with no reciprocal interest."
3,It's Fatal Attraction !,"It's clearly not as great as most reviewers said. Not because of the style : it is as usual straight and sharp. The opening chapter is memorable, the shooting scene in the restaurant vivid in the economy of details and words. Nevertheless, the story shows no big surprise to the reader : you get what you expect. The relationship, as complex as it may be, is déjà vu. Not to mention the highly predictable conclusion. Being an admirer of McEwan's work I advice you to read The Comfort of Strangers."
3,It took forever for the narrator to tell this story,"I read it because it was situationally compelling but I wasn't interested in the narrator, his girl friend was a bit too self centered...and the bad guy was a boring bad guy. Only a few things surprised me. Then, the appendix I found so much more interesting. I liked the case study with just the initials and the 'Sergeant Friday"" narrator. The case study was like watching a really good stripper who reveals nothing. The story from the case study did not put life where it was intended. If you are going to take us on this ride, give us an interesting narrator."
4,Here's a Plot Twist and Surprise...,"Whoa! Here goes a first chapter that has you gasping at the edge of your seat. Yikes! Then there's a fatal attraction 'of sorts' with some additional spice to a story filled with curiosity, mayhem, suspense, attempted murder, love and more. I think it has a lot of psychological thrilling moments. What a clever and very 'well-written' novel. This was recommended to me by Trina Owens, a very sweet English Schoolteacher that I met on the island of St. Lucia in April 2004. I'd definitely recommend this one. I bet it would make a great movie, too!"
2,Disappointing,"I purchased this book with an air of expectation and indeed it started off very well. But the menace implied just didn't eventuate, and I must admit I skipped big chunks of the text. Overall I was very disappointed."
4,Enduring Love by Ian McEwen,"Enduring Love focuses on the mad obsession one Jed Parry has for his victim Joe whom he meets whilst also witnessing and trying to prevent a ballooning accident. What follows is a fascinating and chilling tale of deceipt, love, neurosis, betrayal and an overwhelming sense of disbelief on all sides. The narrator Joe, takes us with him on his range of emotions and we feel profoundly sorry for him as he is treated with an increasing fear by those around him.. Ian McEwen's writing is superb, I found myself unable to put this book down and I also found myself pleading his case and feeling the terror and frustration that the pursuer evoked. I highly recommend this book and hope you enjoy it as much as I did."
4,A interesting quick read.,"A very interesting and inventive quick read. Oftentimes, your own confusion about Joe's sanity becomes indicative of his own declining mental state. This is the third novel of McEwan's that I've read and have yet to be disappointed with one of his books. His writing has been consistent and thought provoking, which is an excellent ingredient for a safe recommendation."
4,wow,"This is only the second Ian McEwan book that I have read but it certainly won't be the last!!From the mesmerising first chapter, where I was literally breathless, until the very satisfying and surprising conclusion I could think of little else. My mind was constantly thinking of possibilities that could have caused the dilemmas experienced by the extremely lifelike characters. McEwan has a way of drawing the reader in to become a silent bystander as the story unfolds. His descriptions are so realistic that at times I would re-read his phrases just for sheer enjoyment. This is a book to be savoured..not a fast read but highly recommended."
1,Don't waste your time,"I totally agree with nelson's review of this book. I didn't like the narrator, didn't care what happened and found all the characters to be boring. I can't recommend a book where I feel nothing -- neither love nor hatred -- toward the characters."
1,rave reviews for this book?,"I started this book with an open mind but just could not finish it. It is one of the worst books that I've ever picked up. How did people get past the ridiculous premise? I found myself (unbelievably) laughing through most of the beginning. In addition, there's nothing particularly engaging or noteworthy about McEwan's writing.For those who are looking for a well-written, thoughtful novel, I would think twice about this book."
1,A pretentious dinner party of a novel,"Insipid. A passion play for a culture that dreams of building shopping malls on the moon. Without strength or wisdom. Ponderous and crippled when it imagines itself tense and well-paced; banal and fatuous when it would have us believe it profound; sentimental, yet unmoving. Not only does form far outstrip meaning today, but meaning has been deleted - made an ""unconcept"" - as an uncomfortable reminder of more earnest, intellectual times. Here, meaning has been purged and replaced with a wicker puppet, and we're too dim to spot the difference. This is latte literature. We're given words for the eye, not the mind or heart. Cultural Newspeak, purged not only of ideas, but of the capacity even to frame ideas. This is a pretentious dinner party of a novel."
1,Did someone say vocabulary ?,When a writer uses the word palimpsests to describe some scratched-out then re-written pages in an address book he should be spanked.
1,objectionable,"The whole story is that the author (who is reflected in the protagonist) attributes untenable amounts of tragic weight to an accidental death. He then infers a great moral deficiency in those who might have saved this person but were not willing to do so when their own lives seemed likely to be lost in the process. This is not just the usual over-blown socially-correct lip service most people offer in the face of a tragedy. This is a humanist to the bizarre extreme. At the same time, he also has no regard for animals. I can't think of a worse person and more objectionable view of things.The writing is very good, but the values of the protagonist are so offensive that most people I know have put the book down without finishing it. The book won accolades, but consider their source, the same who lauded ""Disgrace"" by Coetzee. Unless you are as squalid as the author, it's probably not your kind of story."
5,A very entertaining and highly intellectual mystery,"This is a major work of fiction. It is developed around an unusual medical syndrome and the story line follows a true case history. But the author is masterful in giving us an eminently readable, total engrossing mystery with a zinger of an ending."
3,Joe's sense of personal failure,"The most interesting thought in the book for me was Joe's sense of personal failure. I share this and had not really realised it until I read the book and understood his disappointment at not being a ""real"" scientest. I too share his obsessive behaviour sometimes when under stress and I identified strongly with this.The best scene for me was the balloon scene - after that the rest of the book was good but not at the same intense level (rather like the beach scenes in ""Saving Private Ryan"" compared to the rest of the film.)One final thing that I loved was the fact that I live 10 mins drive from where the balloon scene took place and I know EXACTLY where it was supposed to have happenned. I love my home town and surrounding area and am very proud to have come from there so this was an extra treat."
5,Extraordinary and compelling,"Intellectually this is the most satisfying contemporary novel I've come across. Plotwise the piece is not perfect, but the eloquence of the underlying theme more than makes up for the minor narrative blemishes. The book is bound to be controversial because it makes a forceful (though never heavy-handed) case for reason and logic in the face of the unpredictable and often profoundly dangerous and unfair vagaries of emotion. It gives a very compelling literary form to some of the thorny issues raised by our scientifically informed understanding of human nature. Very, very highly recommended."
3,Simple-minded Plot but (obviously) well-written,"I read McEwan's ""Enduring Love"" to compare it with ""Amsterdam"" since the New Yorker said that E.L. should have received the Booker rathen than Amsterdam.I'm not so sure. Granted: about half of ""Enduring Love's"" chapters are crushingly well-written (the rest are all good to outstanding). But what I didn't like was the E.L.'s Plot and that fatuous Happy Ending...where did THEY come from, some flabby focus group or the book's assigned ""nudge"" publicist?Lamentably, the story's denouement is all-too (snore, huh?) predictable. But, in the event, the outcome of the story is meant to satisfy the shabbier impulses of society, it's the deviant -- and ONLY the deviant -- who pays."
4,McEwan makes me want to drink Lager. (Pun!),"This is the first McEwan I've read and, Good God, was it worth it. Fantastic plotlines, right from the first chapter and it did not stop there. With marvellous description and development of character, McEwan takes you on a spiralling roller coaster ride that leaves you exhausted in your armchair. I am definitely going to buy more of this fine fellow's efforts."
4,Suspenseful and odd,"This was an incredibly strange book; the word strange perhaps being an understatement. This book stays with you after you read it, buried somewhere beneath the surface, which I'm assuming is a phenomenal accomplishment for a novel, but ultimately off-putting for the leisure reader.Don't be mistaken; I thoroughly enjoyed reading this novel. The characters were remarkably real and absolutely unreal at the same time. It's an incredible book in the way that it makes you feel so flabbergasted afterwards, but also leaves the reader slightly disconnected from this odd reality McEwan has fashioned."
4,A CREATIVE CLINICAL STUDY,"A beautifully documented case report inspired by the author's discovery of de Clerembault's syndrome. (Perhaps he became aware of this entity when Stephen Speilberg's stalker was apprehended a few years ago.) With this rare psychiatric condition as the skeleton McEwan produces a ""monster"" of a story. His imagination, his broad knowledge, and his understanding of human psychology enrich a simple linear plot line. McEwan is a creative thinker and a clever writer. Each book is a challenge and an entertainment."
5,Outstanding in so many ways.,"I'm astounded that there are reviewers here who disliked this book so passionately! I was absolutely enthralled from Chapter One and didn't put it down until I'd finished. What a terrific study in how tenuous life's conditions are, among other things. Not only was this an outstanding story of suspense, but also a story of how one's life can change in an instant and what the implications of those changes can be. A large part of the narrative being the ""if onlys"" and ""what ifs"" that we all have experienced.What grabbed me from the beginning was the eloquence of this author. His language flowed in such a way as to really set the scene and bring you into his embrace. This was the first novel of Mr. McEwan's that I've read, but I assuredly will being going back for more."
4,"Disturbing, yet fascinating","As the story unfolds, one is drawn into the struggle of the protagonist to free himself from a seemingly impossible situation. A good story with many twists and turns."
3,Easy to read but not as gripping as its made out,"Some books bore you so much you can't possibly read past the first chapter, others you can't put down. This book was neither. I finished it easily withiout getting bored but the whole story line seemed a little lifeless. Several blurbs describe the book as gripping and horrific. Its nothing of the sort. An accident occurs and a man starts stalking the man character, but its all over before the main character even manages to decide the stalker is even dangerous and he is never described as so. Read this novel if you want to fill in time or find out about what im saying, but don't expect a gripping read!!!"
5,Stunning,"I couldn't put this book down, and it still haunts me. The story is compelling and the prose is lucid and gorgeous. I've grown very bored with contemporary American fiction, so this novel, along with books by Julian Barnes and Jeanette Winterson, was a literary oasis for me."
3,Doesn't quite produce,"The beginning chapter was compelling and I thought he would expand on it, but the plot didn't have much to do with the profound events of that chapter. After reading awhile, it felt like the beginning was contrived just as a plot technique when it was really the best part of the book. I got tired of Joe and Clarissa's wordiness, and how the author would just go off on tangents that weren't very interesting to me. There was a scene at the end that seemed ridiculous but at least it made me laugh out loud (buying the gun scene). The ending was very unsatisfying. Clarissa did not act in a believable way, especially as her character is supposed to be kind and caring--a poorly drawn female character.I enjoyed the first half, but it really went downhill."
1,one of the worst books I've ever read,"I hate when someone gives me a book as a gift. Then, I feel obligated to read someone else's choice. When life is so short, and there are so many books this feels like a terrible burden. I usually refuse to do so on principal.Out of boredom, I broke this rule last week and read this book which I got for Christmas. I will never break this rule again.It was gripping in an irritating sort of way. There were many times it was suspenseful and I couldn't put it down, but the many climaxes were very disappointing. And the characters were HORRIBLE. I didn't like any of them and frankly, I hoped that bad things would happen to each of them."
5,I loved this book!,"This is a must-read for Ian McEwan fans, and a wonderful introduction to the author for those unfamiliar. The book is warm, well-written, meaningful and beautiful. I won't forget it soon."
1,not happy,"I did not get the product i ordered and it cost me $2.68 to return the item, plus the aggravation of waiting for the wrong product and returning it and an unhappy child. It took over 30 days to get my money back. I will not order on line again."
4,Charlotte's Web Pig Wilbur,Wilbur is soft and cuddly. He was smaller than I expected. It is a very cute pig.
2,It is a tiny tiny pig,"It is about palm size, much smaller than I thought. It may be worthy of $5, definitely not $20."
3,pig,"I love pigs, but i was disappointed to see that the pig wasnt pink as the picture displays it. I like pink colored pigs."
5,Adorable Wilbur,"I bought 2 Wilburs, for my 2 nieces, to go with a Charlotte's Web DVD. They absolutely loved their present!"
4,my favorite book!,"this book is amazing! unbelivable stories, gothic pictures, all around the best book i have ever read! the title says it all, journal of a ghost hunter. great read for anyone who's into paranormal investigation or just likes a good bedtime story that will make the hair on the back of your neck stand."
3,Coarse and hard to play balanced,"This shaker is big and heavy. This is not for studio play, but more for live performance. The sounds is coarse and powerful and is really hard to get it smooth/soft. It is more challenging to play this as well because of the size, if you are playing it horizontally, you have to be very careful not to tilt it too much on one side since you will lose the balance since the beads are all over the places and the sound tone will change. You have to play it hard and loud. The construction is sturdy and it actually looks good. So there you go. Depending on what you want, this may be good for you. If you are looking for a softer sound, for studio setting, looks elsewhere."
3,Heavy,Somewhat bulky and difficult to get a finessed/subtle shaker sound. Most appropriate for loud music requiring vigorous percussion--not really what I had in mind.
4,great sound!,"at first i was debating whether to purchase it or not, but i finally did and found its sound to be nice and rich. It is also my first time using a shaker but its one of those learn instantly things... another thing that i really liked is that its really balanced no matter which way you hold it. Finally i would like to add if you plan on using it in the studio go for it me an a pal of mine recorded a song with the shaker pretty far away from the mic and it sounded really good. Great when jamming and or performances and great when recording what else can i say its really good."
1,Hate it,"I didn't even finish reading this book. I tried hard to, but I just couldn't. I wasnt able to focus enough energy on it."
2,Texas Outlaw,No true plot to this book...it just drags on and on...I finish every book I start but this is a tough one!
2,couldn't get past first chapter,I could not get passed the first chapter of this book. It just did not peak ky interest at all.
1,Not so much.,You don't ever have to kill an animal in a book to make a point about a certain character. There 're other ways to describe how evil a person/character is.
5,Great start to a steamy series!,"This was my first read from Adrienne deWolfe and after reading ""Texas Outlaw,"" I bought the whole series. There was a lot of heart and humor in this series. The females aren't the typical romance story characters. All the women in the series are strong, independent and have made choices in their lives that they aren't proud of. These stories show how their love for the right man changes all of that."
5,Wonderful plot!,"I absolutely loved every bit of this story. It was very fast-paced and full of intrigue. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys a good, fresh romance."
2,Long and boring,"Ugh, skimmed this one. Long and pretty bad! I feel that the free kindle books are free for a reason - nobody could fathom paying for it!However, I would like my time back!"
3,Not bad,The language and phrases were a bit hammy at times but overall not a bad read. A little different spin on a traditional romance.
5,Texas Outlaw,Great book! This was another book that I did not want to put down until I had finished it. I enjoyed the characters and the storyline.
4,Texas Outlaw book 1,Really loved this western romance. Loved the whole plot and romance of this story. Can't wait till I read another of her books.
4,Yee haw,"Crooks, Indians Marshall s and soiled doves - what more could you want in a western story. It is an exciting tale. Enjoy."
2,Not like her other books,"I enjoyed some of her other books, but not this one. I stopped half way through, & I NEVER do that. Dark & depressing, & without much interest."
3,so-so,"Not one of my favorite early Wolf regencies. I must say I never thought of the Guardian when I read it, but I can see some similar themes: childhood sweethearts; separated; heroine marries someone else; other guy dies, hero comes back. The hero is too mean to the heroine for my taste."
3,Early Version of the Guardian,"This is an interesting book to read if you're interested in the evolution of the author. You'll see many themes/characterizations that the author used in the later (and better)work, The Guardian. Some key differences: the hero is a much nicer man in the Guardian. In The Scottish Lord he ""cheats"" on the heroine twice that we know of and probably many more times during their long separation. The heroine is presented as a very strong woman, but in the end she forgives the hero far too easily and ends up seeming very weak."
3,review of features,"This book is missing an essential index.In order to find a particular shortcut, one must thumb through page after page, reading all of them until the desired one is found."
2,A bad album,They sound too old.......too old in this album. It reminds me how grandparents behave to children. They don't have the passion and energy they had in their youth. Only for Motorhead collectors
3,Almost...but not quite!,"Another nuclear blast from the original bad boys, and it still rocks! Motörhead can still deliver the goods, and the title track of Snake Bite Love should become another instant classic. Too many weak tracks on this one, but well worth owning. I went to see them on the tour, and even the weaker material sounds great live."
2,If my ears were eyes...I would poke them out!,"I love Motörhead as much as the next headbanger but this album should be considered armed and dangerous! And don't get me wrong I like most of the later material as well as the classics but if you want to listen to this you might as well listen to a toilet flushing over and over again, which would be better.This album is for diehards only(which I am by the way)! Do your self a favor and save the money to see them live when they come around. If you haven't seen them yet, don't wait because Lemmy's blood is slowy crystalizing into pure cocaine and he doesn't have long left. Besides it's always a good laugh to see Phil Campbell the ""Human Blowfish""(If you've seen them you know what I'm talking about).Long live Lemmy!"
2,Motorhead's Worst To Date,"This album is heavy, but there are no memorable tunes here. I hope this doesn't mean Lemmy and company are over the hill."
1,Lemmy should retire,"It's too bad about Motorhead. I used to think that Lemmy was the ultimate rocker and that he would go on forever, but Motorhead hasn't released a decent album since ""March or Die"" and this one is the worst ever. It is absolute slop and nothing but noise. Not one decent cut at all. If Lemmy wants to get back in zone, he needs to find Eddie Clarke and Phil Taylor and get rid of the bums he's playing with now. Remember the jamming on ""Overkill"", ""Bomber"" and ""Ace of Spades""?....well, Lemmy obviously doesn't."
2,Stop tickling me,"Back in the early 70's they made some really cheap horror movies some just had blood, others had zombies and more impressive bugs. One of the more noticeable titles is Kiss of the Tarantula (1976) with a $200K Budget. It stared Suzanna Ling in her only movie; so this is one for your shelf so you can prove you saw here.Susan Bradley (Suzanna Ling) was raised in a mortuary which adds to the ambiance of the story. She is shunned by her mother, coveted by her uncle, taunted by her so called friends, and well you get the picture.Her only recourse is to unleash here furry pets on pet-a-philes and those that pet -turb her. Will she get away with it?I do believe after wading through the whole film with my finger on the fast forward button that no one actually got bit.For the DVD curious the version I watched had DVD extras there were just leaders for similar films of the time like ""City of the Dead."""
5,My wife's favorite,This product is only available locally in a 1.7 ounce bottle and that size here costs as much as the larger size that I bought online. Happy with the product and didn't have to leave the house to make the purchase.
1,Broken Bottle!,"One of the perfumes came out broken, I haven't even open it, it has the plastic wraping and everything it came with, but there's perfume comming out of the plastic, enough that it damaged the wood cabinet where I put it!!!"
3,Mountain songs as old as the mountains,"The recordings on this album are pure Appalachian and Ozark folk music nostalgia, with the guitars played in the unique style of Jimmie Rogers and A.P. Carter. If you enjoy listening to real ""old Fashioned"" mountain ballads performed by real mountain folks, then you'll enjoy this album."
2,"""A"" for effort...","This album is a momumental improvement over the utterly negligable X-Factor ('94), but is still subpar coming from the genius of Steve Harris, Dave Murray and Nicko McBrain. The two tracks worthy of the Iron Maiden name are ""The Clansman"" and ""Futureal""; the other six songs are so-so, which places them well ahead of The X-Factor album, but nowhere near the level of Somewhere in Time, Number of the Beast, Killers...well, you get the idea. Get it if you rever Harris, Murray, and McBrain as demigods as I do, otherwise wait until they get rid of Gers and Bailey (rhythm guitar; vocals) before buying another Maiden ablum."
3,It was Good but not Awesome,"Ive been listening to Maiden for a long time now, and this is their eleventh album. I thought that this was a good album but I was not blown away by it. All the songs on this album is pretty decent accept for one, and that is the second track. I thought the music was pretty good and Blaze is a decent singer although he is not as brilliant as Bruce. I still think that Maiden can do better than this."
5,"A good album, let me explain...","You see, every CD you buy is going to have a couple of tracks on it that you don't like, and since Iron Maiden only puts 8 or 9 tracks on an album, the ratio of good songs to bad songs os smaller. However this is a great album. If this is Maiden distilled of its vitality, then I can't wait to hear Best of the Beast. Best songs: Futureal, The Clansman, The Educated Fool. Worst songs: Como Estais Aigos, The Angel and the Gambler."
1,Garbage!,"This cd is one of the biggest jokes of the '90's. What happened to Maiden? This albumn sucks! BUT, BRUCE AND ADRIAN ARE BACK WITH IRON MAIDEN!; as of Jan. 1999! Bring back Iron Maiden from the '80's!"
2,Welcome Back Bruce!!,Great Music as always! Terrible vocals; though it is a slight improvement over the singing on 'X-Factor'. Welcome back Bruce and Adrian!! Bring back the Iron Maiden of the '80's. Up the Irons!
1,This is not Iron Maiden!,"English: This new band with Blaze should not be called Iron Maiden. The Iron Maiden era ended with ""Fear of the Dark"". This is a sad moment in the history of metal.Japanese: kore wa Iron Maiden ja nai zo. Iron Maiden no jidai wa Bruce no saishuu arubamu ""Fear of the Dark"" de owatta.Spanish: Es pura pendejada llamar a esta CD ""Iron Maiden."" Sin Bruce, ya no existe la banda que se llamaba ""Iron Maiden""!"
2,Weak,"Very weak album, just that, but fans that call themselves ""real fans"" will always say it's great..For your information, this was the lowest-selling Maiden studio album of all times!"
2,YOU DIDN'T SPEND ENOUGH TIME AUDITIONING SINGERS!,"Blaze's voice is flat. It cannot live up to the galloping range of the guitars and the tight arrangements. The band still has the fire but you should have spent more time searching for a new singer before you came out with Virtual IX or The X Factor. Even a singer from an Iron Maiden tribute band (in the spirit of Judas Priest finding ""Ripper"" Owens) would have rejuvenated the band's post-Bruce performances. Bruce may be a hard act to follow, but you certainly must come up with a singer with more range than Blaze if you want to keep Maiden alive."
2,Iron Maiden is suffering without Dickenson and Smith,"I have been a fan of Iron maiden since 1981. I was fortunate enough to see them on their first tour of the states with Judas Priest and Whitesnake.(They had just released ""Killers"") This was my personal favorite line-up.Bruce Dickenson was a very nice replacement for Paul Di'anno and kicked ass on the next few albums. After Adrian Smith left,maiden has not been the same.Dickenson leaving was the final straw.I have nothing against Gers or Blaze but they will never match the power of maiden in the 80's.Steve Harris is my hero and the best bass player in metal, but maiden needs to find that old magic and it's not happening with this album.This is the worst album that they have recorded in my opinion.The songs are cheesey and have a ""pop metal"" feel to them. Wake up Steve!!!!! Eddie Rules!!!!!!!!!"
1,From bad to worse,"I just can't get into Blaze's voice either. The album seems to lack the inspired songwriting of earlier albums like ""Piece of Mind"" and ""Powerslave."" Iron Maiden survived the transition from Paul Di'Anno to Bruce Dickinson, but Blaze...I don't think so. I still think Steve Harris is one of the best bass players in the world, but for the Iron Maiden sound (I hate to say this) Bruce Dickinson's ""Accident of Birth"" with Adrian Smith nails it."
2,"OK, but not in the class of Iron Maiden's best releases","Whatever happened to IM after Seventh Son ? This one's better than Fear of the Dark ... but, that's not saying a lot!!IMHO, after their golden era (the debut album through Seventh Son) they seem to have become just another metal band."
3,Better than 'X Factor'...,"...which isn't saying much. At least with this album, someone told Blaze to sing on key. I felt the songs were much more powerful and meaningful on 'X' even if they were badly sung. But there are some of the songs that are just as powerful (See 'The Clansman' especially on the Rock in Rio)."
4,It was Great but not Awesome,"Well I've been listening to Maiden for a long time now and Virtual XI is their 11th album I believe. I feel that this particular album was Great but it didn't blow me away. I really liked the first song Futureal, but the second song Angel and the Gambler was kinda stupid, and the rest was pretty good. My favorites were, futureal, Lightning strikes twice, the clansman, the educated fool, Don't look to the eyes of a stranger, and the last one. It is definitely alot better than their last flop X-Factor. It is not their best album to date but it is worth buying."
2,"Some decent moments, but the album is too restrained","I love Iron Maiden but something is wrong here. I think it's Steve Harris. Perhaps he just isn't letting everyone do their thing. Track 2 is awful. Further,the drums on this album are all wrong and the guitar work is weak--well below standards I've come to expect from this metal machine. Whatever happened to heavy riffs? Someone should force Steve To listen to Pantera's the Great Southern Trendkill to hear some real guitar work. Blaze is not the problem. Maiden in future efforts need to let down their hair and just play"
2,Sorry guys.. i just can't get into it...,"I am very sorry, but I just can't enjoy Virtual XI as much as I would like to. I just can't get into Blaze's voice, it's just not right. The music is pretty much what i've expected from you guys, but, I regret I will be trading it in. My last official purchase before VXI was Fear of the Dark, and it shall remain so. Thanks for 20 years of excellent music gang! I own ALL the rest and have seen you twice in concert.. thanks again!"
2,Outclassed performance by Iron Maiden,"Let's face it: Maiden was the greatest. Maiden is authentic, never sold their soul (except for the horrible song ""Wasted Love"" of Fear of the Dark) always had a magnificent stage performance, has always fought hard. But the ""Mi,Do,Re"" compositions of Steve Harris are gone, hard to swallow nowadays, mainly when you compare it to the old days of Adrian Smith and Bruce Dickinson. Maybe the return of these two guys will take it anywhere near their potential. And, please, get rid of that lousy guitar player, Jannick Gers!"
1,"BAYLEY AND GERS--ONE DOWN, ONE TO GO!","Yes! Bruce and Adrian are back, and just in time, as ""Virtual XI"" was just another spadeful of dirt on the mighty Maiden metal coffin. Blaze can go back to ""singing"" for Wolfsbane and, as far as most self-respecting Maiden fans are concerned, Janick can go back to playing sessions with Fish. There isn't a good song on ""XI"", and anyone that says differently has been justifying something they can't change. Otherwise, I'm sure they would have! Maiden doesn't need a ""three-guitar attack"", they just need Dave and Adrian to re-weave that familiar 1980s Maiden magic. Up the Irons!"
3,Weak,"Sad to say I found the 1998 releas of Iron Maidens Virtual XI their weakes release since Killers. The album just does not seem like Iron Maiden. Yes, there are some good tracks on it, but it seems obvious that Blaze Bayley got another idea of how to write a song and sing it than Bruce Dickinson, and that marks this album. Lightning Strike Twice and Como Estais Amigos are both good tracks and Lighting strike... sounds a little bit like the old Iron Maiden that we knew.Virtual XI is an ok album, but it is just not Iron Maiden, something is missing..."
1,ultra-bland rehash of previous material,"No energy, no momentum. It was a disappointment given that my expectations of the ""CMC"" Maiden were not high to begin with. Just going thru the motions. This is old Maiden distilled of all its vitality."
1,Crap,Blaze Baily is an absolute loser. Iron Maiden should just lay down and die. What an absolute let down. Where's Bruce when you need him?
4,Back to their 80s sound,"Iron Maiden proves with the brilliant 'Virtual XI' that they're still there. With a sound more bright than in 'The X Factor', Maiden seems to look after its eighties sound, sometimes with a deja-vu feeling (hopefully with Blaze's powerful voice). But, for all its credit, this album is still a little step back from 'The X Factor' where Maiden tried some new path for their music. Maybe they didn't dare as much this time, but flying as high as the sun can prove dangerous."
1,Fursrating,I don't know if I like the product or not because I haven't gotten it yet and it has taken almost a MONTH to get .I know I like Kendra products but I will never order it off Amazon again.
1,A Waste of Time,The material presented in this media has little to no value. A mere 3 - 5 minutes actually is spent delivering the content and the remaining hour is mere self-promotion. The DVD is largely a wast of time.
1,Don't buy it!,"I too thought this press was heavy duty enough to handle the simploe task of press tortilla dough flat. On the first press on this ""high impact"" plastic press the base broke cleanly in half with a noise my husband and dog heard while standing outside in the yard! I bought it at Safeway where it is advertised as a new product."
1,Do Not Buy,"These are not the package shipped, photo doesn't say not actual product... i was shipped box without a bead chain... which was the whole reason i got them for the case/beaded cord for work [I'm an electrician and want clean ear plugs easily accessible on my person..] I'm very dissatisfied because how hard is it to find or even TAKe a correct picture as a retailer... Generally im always excited and happy to get my package... until i saw the low quality case WITHOUT a bead chain."
1,Doesn't form a seal.,"Bought this pair of earplugs as a replacement for some sound earmuffs that broke. Having had more luck with ear plugs in the past, I arrived at this low cost option. I was sorely disappointed. The plastic was hard and didn't form a seal in my ear at all. The case it comes with is very difficult to open, too. Sorry, MSA, I'll think twice about purchasing from you again."
1,Not as shown,"Picture shows clear plastic box with chain but what I received was a different box without a chain. I ordered this product mainly because the picture showed the chain, which I though I could attach to my hardhat. Bait and switch?"
4,x-large 950 elk skin gloves -finger too long but nice quality,"Index finger is way to long on the left hand by 1"". It's the same length as the middle one or longer on this pair. I have big hands with long fingers so I don't think its me. The skin is good and thick. The Tag Says ""Sewn in America with import or domestic materials"". Chinese elk? No- Must be the elastic or stitching thread. Other than the finger length I think these might be really amazing gloves. -Waiting for the replacement from Amazon."
5,Great Book- Read It,"When I started to read this book, I don't think I could ever put it down. This book was my all time favorite book. Sammy Keyes and the Hotel Theif I think will be the best series I ever will read. It's great for the whole family. You will enjoy it from the start.Molly D.11 years old"
4,Sammy Keyes and the Hotel Thief,One day 12-year-old Sammy Keyes is dying of bordom when she decides to take a look through Grams binocolors. And what does she see across the street in the Heaven Hotel? A man with a brown beard with a pair of black gloves searching through someone's purse! When he looks up what does Sammy do...? Wave! After that she tells the police but they don't care much about her sighting. What does a super slueth such as Sammy Keyes do in this situation? FIND THAT THIEF! This a must read which will surprise at the end more than your little brother can scare the daylights out of you.
4,Mysterious Sammy...,"I really enjoyed reading this book. There was a lot of great descriptions of the characters. I just had to keep reading the book to see if Sammy found out who the hotel thief was. I was on my toes the whole time. From the time when Sammy saw somebody stealing things from a hotel room, until the time when Sammy found out who the mysterious thief was, I loved the book. Basicly, I think that anyone who wants a good kid mystery to read, they should read Sammy Keyes books by Wendelin Van Draanen.By: Abigail"
3,HOTEL THIEF,"I like this . I would recomend this book to people who like to read mysteries because there is a hotel thief in the story.The characters that were in the story the most were Sammy, Gram , Marissa. The book also tells about Sammy and Marissa's first day of middle school. And she was getting into alot of trouble for doing something to the girl . She talk about two officers named Borsch and to another officer who they call tall and skinny ."
5,A twisting trining book,Sammy Keyes is a normal girl but not life.Sammy is bored so shelooks at the Heavenly hotel because shes never been.For she see's isvery exciting.
2,No better than the $7 version at walmart,"I have purchased countless numbers of these umbrella strollers over the years for my 4 daughters. I bought this one hoping it would be more durable. It isn't more durable in any significant way. I was sewing it up after just one week of use. However, the frame seems to be stronger. Overall, I am very disappointed for the price."
4,Not A Bad Stroller,"My daughter has used this stroller for several years with her dolls. The wheels, fabric, and frame have held up well although the stroller never seemed to fold up properly even when new. It's fine for pushing/carrying dolls and accessories and will take normal wear and tear but the frame will bend if an overzealous sibling decides to sit in it, as expected. Not a bad stroller."
4,Sturdy little stroller for special babies,"I bought - or rather .. funded the purchase of this stroller. I didn't pick it out. Chloe tried several strollers and buggies and settled on this one. Chloe is 38 months and petite. She has the large carry bed also and hangs it on the stroller along with a little diaper bag when she goes for walks around the farm yard. The wheels must be very sturdy and tough for the terrain she travels. She takes it to the grocery store and on concrete too. She is quite attached to the stroller and her baby. I'm glad she picked a good one that holds up. I would hate to have it break during play.A little cup holder for the mama would be appreciated during hot weather, but all-in-all this is a great product. My neighbor's cheap stroller broke after one week, and we are going strong. A metal frame and better fabric are worth the extra $$."
4,"Great stroller, but....","This stroller is great, but you can buy these types of doll strollers at the big box stores for less money, and they are exactly the same. I am embarassed that I stressed over which one to buy last Christmas, because they are all the same. My two year old loves this one in the house, and so we bought her a cheaper duplicate for playing outside, and they are the same."
3,Difficult to zip up,"It took a lot of time zipping the bag up. Definitely not as easy as sealing a ziploc bag (which I was expecting). Once I got over that hurdle, everything else was a breeze. Very useful bag. Holds a lot of dresses. Great space saver and clothes preserver."
3,more dfficult than the regular bags,the hanging bags are more difficult to work with than the large or extra large bags - difficult to fold into suitcase but are useful for moving.
1,Awful bag,"I bought this due to a previous review. I have a wedding dress that I needed to store. I was able to get it in along with the slip that I wore underneath. Got the bag completely zipped which is hard and time consuming to say the least. I attached the vacuum and sucked all the air out. Put the hanger top back on and I heard air leaking.I adjusted the top and hung it up. Still, the air continued to leak. We took the hanger top off and laid it flat. Came back less than an hour later and all the air had returned.After inspecting the bag we noticed a minute hole at the very top where the plastic hanger is attached. The plastic is very flimsy and thin. I would not reccommend this bag to anyone. It seems that the pressure when sucking the air out combined with the poorly designed plastic at the top rubbing against it punctured the thin plastic. Do not buy this even at $11 it is a waste!"
2,Space Bag,"Kept suction for a short period of time, older models were better quality, eventually even the hangar broke while the older of the same is still fine."
1,"These bags are just a scam, right?","I put my wedding dress in this thing, sucked the air out, put it in another garment bag, and placed it in storage. Within a month it was full size again. I don't believe that I'll ever see a space bag that works."
3,Where can I GET this?,"I have been looking for this item for months. Hanging space bags are great. I've used many of the shorter hanging bags for suits, tops, and skirts. The Space Bags mfr has apparently discontinued the longer length in the hanging vacuum-seal bag, but I don't understand why. I would LOVE to be able to compress my long wool winter coats during the summer for more room in the closet. The shorter hanging bags are just not practical for calf-to-ankle-length dresses or instep-length gowns or for dress slacks that I don't want compress with a horizontal fold. PLEASE tell me where to find any new old-stock, or if another company is making them. Thanks!"
3,Mark Wigglesworth conducts Shostakovich,"Mark Wigglesworth is a competent Shostakovich interpreter, and shows some excellent skills in the Shostakovich Symphony # 5; I wish there were better consistency in his conception of the Symphony's structure -- it would make for a more coherent and convincing argument of his view. Understand that there are some excellently expressive and heart-grabbing moments here --and the BBC National Orchestra of Wales play their hearts out for Wigglesworth; but some of the tempi are (in my view) varied where there seems to be no rhyme nor reason for doing so. For my ears, the Rostropovich performance on LSO Live and the performance by Maxim Shostakovich remain in a class by themselves."
4,"its a movie, it was good","have not yet watched it. Just finished the 6th season and this movie is next, before 7+8. cant wait to watch this weekend."
1,"I REALLY LOVE 24, but...................","I Bought every season of 24 and will buy season 7 tomorrow (opening day). As I fan I was geeked at the coming of this movie. I was soooo disappointed. It didn't have that 24 feel or pace. Slow moving, plodding, lack of action. Jack against terrorist? No. Save the world? No. Nukes? No. CTU? No. Action? No. Slow, plodding, boring??? Yes, yes, and yes. On a 1-10 I give each season between 7 to 9. I would give this movie a 2 on a 1-10. Also, totally NOT necessary to transistion the last seasons. Can I get my $24 dollars back? Still love 24, but redemption has no redeeming value. Peace."
1,24: Redemption (Two-Disc Special Editoin + digital copy,"This film does not have english closed caption, only spanish, which was a big disappointment since my husband needsclosed caption to understand because he is deaf, so we didn't watch this movie. However, the gentlemen that I bought it from was most wonderful as he allowed me to open it, check it out for english subtitles and when it didn't have them, I returned the moviue to him and he refunded me my money along with all shipping costs back and forth."
1,24:Redemption,This product is falsely represented as having English and French subtitles. That was the only reason I bought it. SORELY DISAPPOINTED
2,Missing something the series has...,"I've seen every season of ""24"" and was delighted to see there was more to the saga I had missed and got to feel the rush of new ""24"" again...but this doesn't have the same feel as the show.I felt it was a watered down version of the show. Predictable, boring, no real great action or suspense.I couldn't believe it...I had my girlfriend watch it with me and it was her first time seeing the show and now she has no interest in seeing more.The series is rewatchable, this is not. If you can save your time but if you're like me you'll just have to see for yourself."
2,Why 2 disc #1?,"I don't understand why there were 2 discs #1 in both movies I ordered. I thought it was a mistake, but both movies had 2 duplicate discs. Did anyone else notice this?"
3,24: Redemption,"Quality of product great and shipped almost immediately.A 2 hour movie cannot be compared to the season series. Somehow a story based on 2 hours of real time in Africa seems stretching the concept of ""events in real time!!""But nonetheless still enjoyable...and flowed into season 7 nicely!"
2,Not a Great 24,Just did not like this episode of the 24. I have many more episodes of the years and this 1 episode just had nothing to it.
1,24: Redemption,What a rip off.This movie sucked and it cost $8 I could have had a real movie for that much.
2,24 Redemption lacking intensity.,"24 Redemption provides an intro to the 7th season, taking place between 3 p.m. and 5 p.m. in Africa. It provides an introduction to some of the key players in the upcoming season, and adds a little context to what will take place there. It's also a chance to see Jack Bauer outside his normal element (i.e. not facing imminent death every second). Beyond that, however, it adds little. Don't run out and buy this thinking you'll be lost without it or missing a key ingredient for season 7. This movie-length episode lacks the energy and intensity usually found in 24. You also won't see any of the supporting cast you are used to. This is strictly for diehard fans who have to have all things Jack Bauer. Everyone else will be at least mildly disappointed."
4,A Good Filler Between Seasons,"This two hour movie is long overdue for 24 fans. As last season was cancelled totally due to the writer's strike, it seems like it has been forever since Jack Bauer was doing his thing.The movie itself is ok. It has some pretty good action. There is not much of a storyline, but it is only two hours.Jack is terrific as always. He is helping a friend out at an orphanage he runs in Africa. There is a civil war in progress and the children are targeted. Enter Jack Bauer and watch out bad guys.Any fan of 24 should probably watch this movie to help bridge to season seven. Presumably there are some parts in this that will help one understand the new season better when it starts in January."
5,A must read for military personnel,"This book has what it takes to help anyone, from beginner level to advanced, to improve their run time."
2,Does not attract my cat,"The product was received quickly and well wrapped. However, I am disappointed that this spray does not interest my cat in the least, though she does love catnip treats. I had hoped this scent would encourage her to use a scratching post, but she just shows no interest whatever after spraying it with this spray."
1,Disappointing,"Unfortunately, my two cats paid no attention to anything I sprayed with Super Catnip. They seem to prefer dried catnip."
2,A few more pages would make all difference.,"I purchased the book to learn more about breathing exercise.The book cover each subject very well by telling you how to do all the exercises in the book,But it fails to give guidance needed to understand why you are to do these exercises. A few more pages would make all difference. Or the use of a Zen master to help guide you"
5,Great Book!,"This book rocks. I picked it up and it was so full of spiritual and martial art information that I just couldn't put it down. Scott Shaw's knowledge is totally vast, like one of those old masters you read about. Read This Book! Everyone will gain something from the experience."
5,TrU49erFaN,This purchase was easy and fast. I was very satisfied with the product and how fast it got to my home.
3,Not the best choice...,"After reading reviews about this, I thought this book was going to be very good. But after getting it home, I learned it had nothing in it I actually didn't know. It seems like something a 9 year old would read. It had totally corny stories to support things and anything in the book could have been told to me in a more mature way in any of the magazines(...). I'm a freshman in high school and I wouldn't recommend this to anyone over the age of 10. Look elsewhere!"
1,Doesn't work - needs driver,"There is a driver needed for this cable, and it didn't come with it. I can't find a specific one anywhere, so it's pretty much useless. The drivers on the Nokia site don't work; Windows 7 doesn't recognize the USB controller, and I tried it on an XP machine, with no detection whatsoever. On the other hand, it was cheap and arrived quickly."
5,New version,"This software Landscape vision has a new downloadable version that is much better then the cd one. More options, bigger screen, no changing your grapic setting anymore. Let's you import any image too. I both the first version and liked it, but I needed more options so I upgraded to the next version, and I'm really liking it. Check out their site www.landscapeyourvisions.com"
1,Defective Zipper Pulls,I bought this product 9 months ago and only used it on 2 trips and the zipper pull broke off on one of the zippers. I can't find Delseys phone number or company address because they took down the contact us and customer service information off of their website as of 1/08/2008. I had to find their address via the Better Business Bureau and still can't reach them. Dont buy this luggage unless you want to use pliers to open your bag.They are not honoring their warranty.
3,"Lightweight, good looking, but not durable","I bought the entire set in blue and it's great for travelling on the plane because it's so lightweight (can pack more stuff). Rolls really well and the bright color is easy to recognize in the mass of black luggages on the carousel. Unfortunately, the first time I took the 25"" luggage on the airplane to Canada, it ripped at the seam at one of the bottom corners. Note that I did not overpack as I had to keep it under 50 lbs. I don't know if it was mishandled by the airline or if the luggage is just a bit flimsy. I have travelled abroad many times and used even cheaper brands of luggage that had withstood the airline handling. So I am a bit disappointed in the durability as warranty does not cover 'normal' wear and tear from airline handling even though it was my first time using it."
3,"I liked it, but.....","I really liked this luggage, especially the weight and the amount that could be packed in it. However, recently on an extended trip, the extension handle would not work (i.e. extend), making it basically a useless piece of nice luggage. It is hard to describe how hard it was to carry luggage that you are accostomoed to rolling. I ended up leaving the luggage behind at that stop on my journey. I don't know if any others have had the same issue, which I have never had with any piece of luggage, no matter how cheap or expensive."
5,Delsey Rocks,"This is the lightest, sturdiest luggage I have ever owned. I especially like the stand/handle on the bottom which make it easy to pickup."
1,Cheap Internal Frame,I had this bag for exactly one trip before it broke. The wheels folded in as I was leaving the airport. Upon inspection I found the internal frame which is made of cheap and brittle plastic to be in about a hundred pieces. Materials for construction are thin and brittle. This bag will not hold up. Avoid.
2,Delsey Helium Fusion 25 Expandable Suiter Trolley,"This bag may be good for the occassional travler, but I returned this suitcase because it did not appear sturdy enough to withstand the rigors of frequent travel. Additionally, the expandable suiter feature was a disappointment and not as well designed as other luggage at a higher price point. I purchased this bag for my wife, as I already have a Delsey Suiter which I paid more for. The higher priced Delsey I have is fantastic and it withstands frequent travel. The purchase of this bag validated that old cliche', ""you get what you pay for"" and I found that saying is certainly applicable to luggage. I suggest you invest a little more money and buy a better, sturdier suitcase, because it will last longer...."
1,Broken zipper pulls,"This is not as lightweight as I would have thought. It weighs about 10 lbs empty.After using this suitcase for a year, 3 of the zipper pulls are broken so it is no longer usable. Very disappointed in this piece of luggage."
4,True Shopper,"I usually get Gucci, Coach, Cartier, and other brand name purses, but my cousin bought this for me and I found it pretty fitting because I am a true shopper! This fits a lot of my things and it costs way less than my shopping spree of purses. This cost less than 50% of 50% of the price I spent on my Louis Vuitton crocodile make-up bag that can only fit a few of my lipsticks!"
3,Attractive and Whimsical but not Well-made,First birdbath was broken in half inside the mailing container. Used gorilla glue to fix the second one when the metal receiver end for the rod broke off the bowl. It looks great though!
3,"OK mug, but leaks","I am a huge cubs fan, so when I saw this cool mug, I was really excited. The mug is great, except that you have to keep it upright because it leaks."
5,Ethereal,"This is an excellent cd to purchase if you'd like to experience Darby & Tarlton, but don't want to pay 80 dollars for their 3 cd's which include their complete recordings. Songs like ""Frankie Dean"" (a version of ""Frankie & Johnny""), ""Lowe Bonnie"" (in the ""Henry Lee"" family) and ""On The Banks Of A Lonely River"" are immortal testaments to American folk music. The guitar playing by both men is excellent, and the singing is better than that of just about any Old-Timey duo I can think of. If you like Grayson & Whitter, Burnett & Rutherford, or Frank Hutchison, buy this cd!"
3,Not what you would expect.,"Well, if you're expecting a classic southern rock album, this isn't it. In fact, there's no southern rock at all to be heard on this album. So if you're into this music, this album won't do.As a AOR/melodic rock album, it isn't too bad. I really like the duet on 'Closest thing to heaven' and 'Saturday Night' (although it doesn't even come close to the original by Dutchman Herman Brood). There isn't one song that really makes me go 'WOW', but only 'Private Life' is really annoying.Not a great album, but not as bad as some people would have you believe either."
2,Makes Vertical Smiles sound good. For collectors only...,"This really is a Ricky Medlocke solo album as no original members of Blackfoot are on this disc. I'm sure the name Blackfoot was attached more or less for marketing purposes. If you're familiar with Vertical Smiles, then this record is even more ""commercialized"" complete with keyboards and less than spectacular songs. In fact, this one makes Vertical Smiles sound like a good solid disc. Two stars because I'm a fan of Ricky Medlocke's music, but this one is really only for collectors."
1,WHAT HAPPENED?,"I GAVE IT A STAR BUT YOU CAN ADD A MINUS TO THAT. NOW I HAVE READ THE OTHER REVIEWS, WELL YOU BOY'S SOLD BLACKFOOT SHORT. THIS IS IN NO WAY ANYTHING LIKE THE BAND BLACKFOOT. I AM SO SAD. NOW THE MAN CAN SIGN, BUT THAT IS IT. IT SOUNDS LIKE I WAS READY TO WATCH FOOTLOOSE. THERE IS NOT A SINGLE SONG THAT SOUNDS ANYTHING LIKE THAT ASS KICKEN GROUP. ANY OF YOU ALL WHO KNOWS BLACKFOOT AND WROTE THE OTHER REVIEW HAVE BEEN SMOKEN CRACK. WHO PAID YOU FOR SUCH A GOOD REVIEW. I WANT TO KNOW WHAT THE F--- HAPPENED?WELL DISCO IS A LIVE AND WELL WITH THIS ONE AND YOU CAN DANCE THE NIGHT AWAY, ROCK MY ASS. AND BOY'S WHO WROTE THE OTHER CRAP, I WILL MEET YOU ANYWHERE, ANYTIME TO BUST YOUR ASS FOR SAYING WHAT YOU DID, DON'T HOG THAT PIPE, YOU ALL HAVE HAD ENOUGH. DOWN, REALLY DOWN ABOUT THIS ONE, MARTY"
4,Awesome!,I was very pleased with this cd. I just wished it had more songs that I really loved but overall I am pleased with my purchase.
4,A Psychological Thriller with Richard Dreyfus,"Richard Dreyfus is always exceptional at portraying all characters - but he especially does well at portraying attorneys and psychologists. Here he is a psychologist brought in to work with a boy who's witnessed his parents being murdered. The acting is top notch. As good as Dreyfus is, it is the boy actor who steals the show.This was a very interesting story. It has disturbing elements, so it's definately not a family movie. But I like pyschological thrillers, and this one kept me engaged. It never drags. I recommend it."
5,Bland Romantic Movie with Bite,"The movie was bland, and seems like a lifetime network movie reject, but yet it has an undeniable edge, because of the ending, and also the actors in the movie. rachel blanchard and dj qualls elevated this movie to five stars because of their superb acing abilities."
3,"Impulse Buy, but Worth It","This CD is testament to many things: 1) the failure of McLaren to make anything like a decent investment in his band's sound equipment, 2) the importance of having a competent bassist for any rock band, 3) How Johnny Rotten had to struggle to develop his voice, 4) How powerful that voice could be, and 5) the genius of the Stooges (""No Fun"" is the highlight of the set). If you're a Pistols fan, this is worth the aggravation. But you should be familiar with ""Bollocks"" already, to know what song it is you're listening to..."
5,"Hilarious, even to a non-golfer","Simply one of the funniest books I have ever read.It is hard to write humor-I know, I have tried. And it is even harder to makes golf funny to a non-golfer like me.But this books succeeds, in spades. While I am not a golfer, I had trouble reading some sections, as my eyes were tearing so from laughing. I also highly recommend his ""Art of Coarse Sailing"".Highly recommended."
3,Was not thrilled,"An average album!!! Did take to this album much! Not in the same as Time Together, which I also bought and loved!"
5,Excellent.,The album is great. It is a real must. It is a very soothing album. His silky smooth voice has not changed since I first heard his songs in the 80's.
2,Two to three good cuts,"Don't know what happened here--been a serious Mr. Franks devotee since Art of Tea but this one is like going to a Woody Allen movie lately--its no Manhattan or even Annie Hall--but its still Michael Franks--besides, 'we still need the eggs.'"
3,This one is a bit odd...,"This smells like Raid bug spray when my wife first sprays it on... neither of us care for that bug spray smell. Yet, after about an hour it mellows out to a really nice ""non-bug spray"" scent that we both like. So, it ends up _good_, but it starts out strange! Won't be trying this one again, it's okay... but not one of our favorites."
3,ok,It's kind of cheaply made. One of the fasteners on my box doesn't line up perfectly so there is this friction every time I open and close the box. I would go for something a little better.
4,leviathan,leviathan: if you like the thing you will love the leviathan.just the right amount of cheesey one liners and lots of funny special effects
3,Kind of old but still fun,"I saw this film 18 years ago and I was scarred, Now that I saw it again I found it not bad. Effects now seems kind of cheese but have nice tension."
3,ok but not great,leviathan is one of a wave(no pun intended) of underwater action movies that came out in the late 80's and while another alien rip-pff this is ok if you get into it. miners on the ocean floor find a sunken russian ship and it's safe. in that they find a flask of wiskey and drink from it. what they don't know it is some drug that changes you into a creature of some kind. not great but you may enjoy it in right frame of mind
2,Doesn't live up to its ambitions,"This is a special effects movie from 1989. Considering its age, the special effects hold up very well. However that can not be said about the plot of this movie. There first half of the movie starts slowly and it attempts to build supsense until the monster arives. Unfortunately the monster itself is so preposterous that its arrival only brings a major let down in the plot. The extended chase sequence is straight out of 'Alien' but holds none of the emotional tension that 'Alien' succeeds in providing.This is a movie that tried to replicate the success of 'Alien'. It is really just 'Alien' placed underwater with none of its suspense."
4,"Come on people, this movie was not that bad","Listen, I am not saying this movie was on the level of alien, but let's get real. It was not as bad as say, a Carrot Top movie. Well acted and some good special effects make this a very entertaining movie. Give this movie a chance and I can guarantee that you will be surprised. Enjoy!"
2,The biology and physics errors destroy this movie!,"Q. What happens when you try to mix elements ofAlienwithThe Abyss?A. Nothing good.Some infectious agent that ""parasitizes"" humans and turns them into monsters from the deep that grows at an astounding rate and requires no energy and nutrient intake while growing. Divers don't get the bends from an emergency ascent after many days living under the ocean in deep water. There must just be standard air instead of any special deep water habitat air mix. Pieces of the habitat just seem to fall down inside for no good reason.I found myself just wondering who was going to live, and who was going to die. I had one right and one wrong guess.Yawn."
3,80's Alien rip off that isn't too bad,"Since the first two Alien films, there have been countless big budget and low budget thrillers that take the formula of the previously mentioned films and make it so contrived that there is hardly a shred of originality left in the idea. Leviathan is close to being an example of this, and while it's hardly original in it's plot, the cast, effects, and set designs help it stand above other derivative drivel like Deep Star Six and other Alien rip off's to come out of the 80's. Peter Weller, Ernie Hudson, the late Richard Crenna, and Daniel Stern are among the crew members of a salvage crew who find a submerged Russian ship. After Stern's character treats himself to some vodka found on board, he is transmutated into a slimy and hungry creature that is soon picking the crew off one by one. Not original in the least, but it has enough going for it to keep it from going overboard into complete absurdity."
2,Alien meets Abyss meets crap,"To my surprise I actually enjoyed the first half of this movie. But once this poorly made fish creature began appearing while devoring half the cast, the movie transformed into an exact clone of Alien and I lost interest. Peter Weller and Ernie Hudson are the bright spots in an otherwise routine monster film with an unbelievably stupid ending."
4,Good Visual Effects Movie,Leviathan unlike the Abyss was one of numerous underwater thrillers that had good special effects but needed more work on the script. Peter Weller played a good part but should've stuck to playing Robocop and Richard Crenna who played Doc has never been the same since First Blood in 1982. But all in all A great film.
1,a total dud: survival of the best looking,"I made the mistake of asking a group of friends to see this in the theatre and was embarrassed that I wasted all of our time. I know there are some who like it, but we found it so insipid, so unoriginal, and so unbelievable that it was not even funny enough to laugh at.The story is that the Soviets were messing with genetic engineering, experimenting on a crew with spiked vodka. Rather than creating homo aquaticus, it made men into monsters that want to kill everyone else. Not only are the special effects laughably bad, but the acting is indifferent at best.Don't bother."
4,Solid and dependable read,"Mark Billingham has created an excellent character in Tom Thorne, the policeman filled with issues both professional and personal.In this novel, Thorne is sent to investigate a kidnapping case where the son of a retired senior policeman has been taken by parties unknown for reasons unknown. Immediately Thorne has concerns about the behaviour of the kidnapped son's family and the story unfolds from this point.The author tells a good tale with a number of riveting moments, maybe let down a little by the conclusion to the story which I found a smidgen complex and far-fetched but as always with a good writer, it isn't the mystery itself that is the reason you keep buying their books, it is the interactions of the main characters.One of the strongest elements in the book is the sense of loss that Thorne has for his father and this is done exceedingly well.I would recommend the books of Mark Billingham if you like Ian Rankin, they both can tell a top story."
4,A good read.,"Captain James Winters is accused of committing a murder he didn't commit. His own agency seems set to take him down for this crime, and it's up to the Net Force Explorers to prove that he didn't commit the crime of murder.This is an excellent book that kept me interested throughout the story. There isn't as much action as other Net Force books, but the story is good and there's enough action to keep you reading.This one is worth the money, buy it today, you won't be disappointed."
5,AWESOME SLEEVES,"I used them with perfect Fits from KMC and they work GREAT!!! I love them, I will never buy any other combination of sleeves again. would recommend to any and all MTG players"
5,INCREDIBLE!!!!!,"Rickey Godfrey's cd Soul Sensations is absolutely the best cd anyone will ever own. From the very first song to the last, they are all a hit! The man is unbelievable, so talented, and will make you fall in love with this cd right away. This is a must purchase and if anyone ever has a chance to see this band perform live, GO!!!!!"
4,You can't be serious!,Wink is the illest rider known on the east coast. The video is a must have for any sportbike rider. The skits are funny as hell. Ruff Ryders Ride or Die!
2,What Haapened?,"The only track I really like on this album is 15 the last one. The freestyle was hot but that was it. ""Watch who you beef with"" was okay. I expected more from CAN."
4,Redemption Granted,Bis' rocked the mic till the chords frayed the grill sprayed with spit off the top off the brain. 2000 BC will forever and shall remain . the undesputed champion emcee in the game. production is ill while lyrics they stay the same. battlen and threats to be slain. and thats the thing that kept it shy from 5. althogh the cd is mos definatly worth the 12.99. take this advise wise and purchase 2000 BC so canibus can eat. peace
5,2000 b.c.,"canibus has busted loose. for those reviews i read on several online rap sites, which dis this cd, you guys are ridiculous. first of all, with the first track c quel, canibus opens with a raw beat with a mixture of old lyrics going on two verses at a time. not only is the idea brilliant, but it comes off incredible as well. from this point on you will realize that the entire cd is blazing and there is truly no one who can rhyme better than this cat. although the lyrics aren't as good as his debut, they flow real well with the beats. standout tracks include 2000 bc, c quel, and 100 bars. A definite must buy and if you don't cop it, you are definitely not a true hip hop fan."
4,4.5 Stars on this lyrical joy ride!,"You've got to go back to 95-97 to appreciate the lyrical brainstorm Canibus has been given to the hip-hop underground. DJ-Clue, Tony Touch, Flex, Doo-Wop and many other DJs have had there mix tapes Lyrically Blessed my Canibus. This is one of the very few all around true MC. This kat can rhyme on a level above all other MC's. Not sence KRS-One has anybody had the skill to free style off the top of his head for an entire show. This CD is much better than the last and should be copped just because of his battling style. Rakim appears on one of his joints and they rip that track to shreds. This kat is the logo and bluebrint to a real MC.oNe"
5,raw and crazy!,"canibus iz bringin it raw for one of the tightest albums of the year! the beats and lyrics r tight... overall this is a great album! much better than i expected from him!well, now well see if LL's G.O.A.T. can live up!"
3,"Amazing MC-ing, but weak beats & too much repetition","Some of Canibus's lines are pure genius like ""I tear down mic's and put an 'out-of-order' sign on 'em"". His track with Rakim is gory as hell and he matches Rakim's wordplay pretty well. But Canibus is kind of a one-trick pony as an MC, and his style grinds on after a while. But I still give him props because that one trick that he has is better than 90% MC's out there entire careers! Also the newcomer Journalist delivers two great rhymes, especially on ""Die Slow"" - I'd like to see a solo record by this guy. But the beats are kind of weak overall, and the album loses its heat about half way through."
5,WOW !,This albumn is amazing!! I absolutely love it! Every song is great! This is rock and roll at it's best; a classic! Buy this albumn!
3,Worth a listen,"I'm a huge B.O.C. fan, I think. I've seen them five times, I own every disc, etc. With that said, I bought the disc and it is pretty good...I just wish there last album had been the phenomenal Imaginos. There is a fantastic (superb, moving, awesome) review here by someone who almost made me want to buy the disc again! -- But I still feel it is inferior to most of their other work. ""Damaged"" and ""Harvest Moon"" are great, though. Perhaps some of my dislike is due to the fact that for FOUR years B.O.C. was playing two songs off the album in their concerts, and stating ""this is off our new album, it's coming out this summer"". Well, four summers later it came out. Do yourself a favor and buy Imaginos."
4,BOC- The Golden Age Of Metal,"I've been stuck in the cold gray light of dawn for ten years. The only sight of the real world was a CD called ""Bad Channels"" 1992. That record, let me stay un-damaged till I heard ""Heaven Forbid"". Dharma's riffs on this CD has reminded me why I'll always be a BOC fan. I hope the next disk is coming soon."
3,Not as good as their other Albums,"If you have every other BOC album then buy this one. If you don't ,spend your money one of their other classic albums. I think this album was alright, but I much prefer their older stuff."
4,Great lost album,"I am an avid follower of BOC and did not know about this cd. This cd was produced during the period that I consider was when BOC were not at their finest. But after playing this album I was surprised that I really liked it. Then the cd grew so much on me by repeated playing that I highly suggest all BOC fans get this great cd. You will not be disappointed. the opening song ""See you in Black"" is classic old type BOC to me. There are many gems on this cd and I love the last song on this cd which is a live version of the song ""In Thee"". BOC fans this cd is a must!"
4,"another cool boc cd , heaven forbid!","This one has the band produce a much stronger cd than they had since 'the revolution of night' in 83. It's darn good imo and the next one is even better! I can't say there is a bad song on this one and I bought it off the shelves in the late 90's. The cover is very strange , and it made me hope that someday they'd do a song about zombies! Anyways if you are fan of melodic metal then you'll enjoy this one. It's less poppy than their later 80's work so it's more solid too."
4,Solid!!!,"Quirky, dark humor, lots of guitar, just what you'd expect from BOC. Eric Bloom sings like he means it and the band is pummeling. Best BOC in years."
4,Still a believer!,"This CD is a very welcomed addition to my BOC collection. I hadn't really tuned in to any of the last CDs and Heaven Forbid was a nice surprise. For me, this is a very different BOC CD. I think its a very strong album and does justice to them. I'm very happy they didn't go mainstream like so many bands do. Also, I'm glad they didn't stick with what made them great, not that that is bad, but it shows, to me, they are still looking and searching within themselves for their own type of music and its still developing. I think they do a great job. Another trademark of BOC is when they put out a CD the whole thing is strong not just one or two tracks. This CD lives up to that. I give this CD 4 stars because I was comparing it to the BOC music I grew up with and you can't compete against that. Standing on its own merit, its a 5 star CD. By the way, BLUE OSYTER CULT ROCKS!!"
5,BOC Only Gets Better With Age,The critical acclaim this CD received was well deserved. As someone who has many (but not their latest cd's) this was a pleasant surprise. Nice balance of hard rock and melodies. Loved it !
5,"YET ANOTHER CLASSIC,ITS THAT SIMPLE","A classic return to one of the worlds great rock bands.fun,intelligent rock music that only b.o.c can do.for me one thing,s for sure my god definitely rocks and has got me spinning this constantly. FANTASTIC."
4,SURPRISINGLY CURRENT YET TO THY SELF LOYAL,"Whenever a band releases a new recording on the heels of their anthology, I'm always suspicious. So I acquired this CD with an amount of caution and trepidation. It's in the drawer now. He's singing about""X-RAY EYES"". I think he can see me. I'm frightened. I think it's Freddie. I'm awake but having nightmares. I'm ""DAMAGED"". I love it! STARLA SAYS ""Steal It!"". 4 0f 5 ain't bad."
4,"Listen to it, You will be surprised!!!!!!","Heaven Forbid, BOC's First album in 10 years pleasently surprises by kicking butt on almost all cylinders. Harvest Moon, should be a top 40 hit but never will, No radio station dares play much BOC, there are seen as either to much of an INSIDERS band or to obscure to have written anything good lately. I BEG TO Differ, You will Love Harvest Moon, You will not be able to stop singing Damaged, the Real world's lyrics will not stop running through your head. You Will Love this Album. And when your ready to Switch tracks & speeds Try Power Underneath Dispare or See You In Black The band will & I repeat will AMAZE you....."
4,Wonderful Tales of Love & Tragedy,"I will admit up front that I am an admirerer of the Old Regime. I found Mr. Radzinshy's book fare and moving. He shows Tsar Nicolas in a more humane light in both his personal life and as Tsar of all the Russias. Mr. Radzinsky has not taken up the mantle of Tsar bashing or walking through the rose garden of Tsar worship. He has created a picture of Tsar Nicolas that is most human and tragic. He demonstrates that Nicolas was not as imcompetent as most hack historians would have us believe. If we see the Tsar in his time he comes off no better than the democratic west, but much better than many monarches that have been praised heavily by revisionist historians. I like the book and highly respect the author. I believe it will be invaluable to future historians as the most objective, so far, life of the Last Tsar."
5,Too fine for words,"I began my review with the phrase too fine for words, but I suppose thats an oxy moron in reading. Indeed though it is a spectacular accomplishment, from the beginning, ""We called it Atlantis"" that lost Russia. Mr. Radzinsky Chekovs succesor pulls the reader immediatley from his own world into a lost long white night of sledges on runners and pastel palaces and a beautiful haughty girl married to a small sweet man who lived only to please her. The story darkens these two unfortunatley hold the lives of millions in their hands an empire falls and a magic fairytale Russia dissapears into legend. I'm not a good enough writer to be able to adequatley describe this book, I can say that it will haunt the reader forever."
4,Take a trip down history lane,"A book with more than enough details to make a Romanov history buff happy. A small problem I have is the author's flowery and at times grandiose writing style, which occasionally detracts from the history and facts presented. Then again, he is a playwright. Not to mention the book is a translation from the original. All in all I would still rate Robert K. Massie's work on the subject as supreme, but this book is nevertheless a great read."
3,Forgiveness,"Jackie Kennedy Onassis was the editor for this book - so said the author in an interview for a two hour documentary called ""Jackie."" He mentioned forgiveness as a key part of this book - no one has mentioned it in the reviews. I have not purchased the book because I read the reviews and this was not mentioned. Would someone like to comment?"
1,ignorance shows.,Bemuses me why a premium priced author does not realize the word bemuse is NOT synonomous with Amuse. or at minimum his editor...assuming anyone proofs ANYTHING anymore. How can I trust the publisher to have gotten other details right...things i wont catch
3,Good read but not great!,"Alas, I wanted so much to become obsessed with this book, since I am obsessed with the whole Romanov legacy. However, Radvinsky's style left me frustrated. He throws in his personal opinions throughout, he dwells too much on details instead of sweeping us along on this horrendous tragedy in which the Tsar, the Empress and the five children were butchered. Paul Massie's extraordinary, Nicholas and Alexandra, is still the greatest book on this subject ever written. I'm re-reading it now for probably the upteenth time and never fail to be hypnotized by the wonderful flow, details and descriptions created by Massie. The Last Tsar is still a must-read. but it can't galvanize the reader like Massie did in his towering achievement."
4,"Good insight into the lives of Nicholas, Alexandra & family.","This book will teach you a lot of good information about tsarist Russia, in particular about Nicholas II's reign. The book is exhaustive in its research on the subject, and talks about Nicholas' relationship with Russian citizens, Rasputin's influence with Alexandra and the last days and death of the tsar and his family. However, it is hard to follow all the twists,turns and names that Radzinsky includes. Who did what and why, as well as how the tsar died, who might have lived and what was done with the bodies becomes tedious and a little difficult to follow. Otherwise, this book is readable, informative and entertaining."
3,It's OK,"The history is all there in detail. Very interesting, particuarly if you are into tzar history like I am. However, the book is really hard to read. It usually takes me no longer than a week to read a book, but this one actually took me almost 2 months."
4,the new ice princess!!!,"what a wonderful surprise!!!,emilie done soundtracks about the land of ice and its creatures.even if u have a flu,or allergic to all coldness of wintery nights,you'll warm to her lullabies.some songs are instrumentals but i would love to think it more like emilie trying to capture the essence and spirits of all artic/antartica.think bjork,that stina girl and you'll get what i mean.the lyrics are really poetic.if u are a fan of all non-mainstream or to nurse that irritating flu,this will do for warm winter darkness!"
4,Great Live Album....,"I bought DLA not knowing how it would sound. I thought that it would be similar to Live in the Raw, IT IS NOT! It is 10x better and you get 2 CD's with this set. Blackie Lawless and Company out did themselves with this show. The best HONEST ""LIVE"" album that has come out in the last 10 yrs. You will not be dissappointed."
5,Best Wasp yet.,I saw their show in 97 and the album captures the intensity of their music perfectly. Even better than Live in the Raw.
1,KINDLE EDITION IS UNUSABLE DUE TO MISSING ACCENTS AND DIACRITICAL MARKS,"The Kindle Edition of Naughton's Czech, an Essential Grammar is useless. Despite multiple downloads and discussions with Kindle customer service, the book downloads to the Kindle without many accents and diacritical marks on the letters -- for example, throughout the entire book, ""R"" with hook/hacek -- has no hacek. Same for ""r"" -- no hook/hacek. The same holds true for other letters with hooks/haceks. Thus, THE BOOK IS USELESS IN ITS CURRENT FORMAT. Without the accents and hooks/hacky, one cannot learn the language. I speak Czech and can see that all the accents are missing, but a non-speaker or learner of the Czech language would not know this, and thus would learn many, many words completely incorrectly. THE PUBLISHERS NEED TO CORRECT THE KINDLE VERSION OF THIS BOOK."
5,Charitable Institutions Guide,"The Guide to Gifts and Bequests is a reference work designed to provide donors, attorneys, accountants, bankers, and foundation officers with the basic information about the purposes, programs, and people of voluntary institutions. With this information, donors and legators can better select charitable institutions suited to their philanthropic objectives. It provides a range of information to help donors make informed philanthropic choices. -- excepts from book's preface"
2,Warning Case on Cap is not removable,"Pros: It has a clip, protects screen and mirrored area of sansa express.Cons: The casing for the larger portion of the sansa express is two pieces and is easily removable. However, once you put the case on the cap, learn to love it b/c you will not be able to remove it ever again. Since you can't take the case off the cap, dust,etc builds up inside and makes it difficult to clean.Called sandisk and they do not offer/sell replacement caps for the sansa express.I would not recommend this product unless you don't mind that it is not removable."
1,World's Worst Transation!,"I could not believe my eyes when I received this package, what I got! There was just one lobster tail and it was one of the smallest lobster tails I have ever seen! I could not believe that I just spent 12.99 for a baby lobster tail plus an incredible 20.00 for shipping that they charge you. I tried to contact costumer service through phone but all I ever got was an answering machine. I tried to contact them through emailing customer service, but no one ever responded back! So I was gypped out of over 30 bucks and I'm mad."
5,This is essential reading for everyone.,"This book contains essential information for anyone who would prescribe, use or research oral contraceptives. As a physician, I have found this book to contain all of the necessary information required to make a truly informed decision about oral contaceptives and other similar medications. This information is either ignored by the general public, but usually buried by the pharmaceutical companies in technical jargon that the average person finds impossible to understand. Mr. Wilks' book cuts through all of this and presents all of the information about these drugs; their risks, side-effects and complications, in an easy to read format that cannot be found anywhere else. Professionals and consumers alike will find this book extremely informative and probably more than a little disturbing, as the truth about these drugs is seldom told."
2,Such a shame,"The first book, Forge of God, was a true masterpiece. This sequel however is less than worthy to be called a sequel. The story it self is not very interesting, therefore I will not mention it. The characters are ever so wrongly put to words, most of them are children, it's mentioned quite a few times, but none of them acts like children. Sure they might be last children to have seen Earth, but is this a reason to have them act like grown-ups? I think not, they act illogical and one dimensional.A shame, the first book was truly enjoyable, the second book wasn't even a true sequel."
4,Afghanistan: A military history from Alexander the Great to the Fall of the Taliban,Excellent book that informs the reader about the country and its military events. US Army issues this book to some Soldiers deploying to Afghanistan.
2,Less than expected,"An interesting first few pages on Afghan Ethnicity and Alexander the Great's conquest, but then very confusing and haphazard. I trugded through Ghengis Kahn et al, but then I skipped to the British adventures. I found these to be a rehash (in too many details) of many other, better written sources. I am struggling through the Russian invasion but I am getting as bogged down as they did. There must be a more readable history of Afghanistan out there somewhere."
2,Average read with some modest insights,"I had read this book on preparation for deployment to Afghanistan with the Army to give me a better sense of the military history of the country. The book is a slow read and only gives some modest insights, but it is not tightly written. The history does not flow well or evenly in the writing. Instead, the book seemed more like a collection of random short stories somewhat strung together chronologically than a well woven story of Afghanistan and its people. On the whole, this book was just not as helpful as I thought it would have been as an officer preparing for an Afghanistan deployment. Once getting here to Afghanistan, this book did not give me any unique insights into Afghan military history that I couldn't have found on my own."
2,Unenlightened View of Military Violence and its Futility,"Mr. Tanner tends to repeat the details of battle with an unenlightened attitude that allows him, all too often, to glorify battle and its associated carnage and death. While a careful and reasoned reading of the tragedy and gore represented by the exploits of Alexander the Great makes the folly of war clear, the author of ""Afghanistan - A Military History"" never seems to see that himself, or be aware of the inappropriateness of his glorification of war. His point of view seems dated.I have only read the first couple of chapters, and with the way in which the topics are presented in a pro militaristic way, I may not finish the book.I commend the depth of research, but the author also tends to speculate too much, drawing his own conclusions that sometimes seem less than fully substantiated by the evidence cited."
5,Detailed and Highly Readable Analysis,"This is an excellent work and is a must read for any serious student of Military Studies. Although some would point to his errors of spelling certain place names, this point was covered in the ""Preface"" to his work as the Author acknowledged the differences in opinion on correct spelling.This book is highly readable history, comprehensive in its coverage and fair-minded in the way it is conveyed.As a side bar, be sure to have a very good geographical map or maps of the area of Central Asia before you begin.A must readDr. Terry TuckerCombined Security Transition Command-Afganistan"
3,An Incomplete Military History,"The subtitle of Stephen Tanner's book about Afghanistan describes it as being ""A Military History from Alexander the Great to the War Against the Taliban."" However, there is a serious omission.It is now known that the Roma, known pejoratively as ""gypsies,"" were driven from their homes in northern India during the first 25 to 30 years of the 11th Century. A largely warrior class in their native country, the Roma were forced on a long and tragic diaspora by a series of 17 raids led by Mahmud of Ghazni, the first sultan of the Ghaznavid dynasty in Afghanistan. Described on one website as ""a zealous Sunni Moslem,"" Mahmud looted northern India of great riches, drove out the Roma in the name of Islam, and annexed the Punjab in 1021.Perhaps for future editions, Mr. Tanner might wish to collect this information from modern Roma scholars such as Dr. Ian Hancock.Chris Frazier"
4,Informative work,This book gives brief information with certain details about Afghanistan from the past to present time. Most important thing is world giants fights for their own benefits not for Afghan people. It was seconder issue hundred years ago and still is.Omer Tarzi.President of Mahmud Tarzi Cultural FoundationGrand son of Sardar Mahmud Tarzi/ 1st minister of F. A. Of Afghanistan
2,Premature and lacking detail,"For starters this book prematurely declares that the Taliban has fallen. Even now in 2007 the US is dealing with the Taliban. Second this book describes various battles and wars, but doesn't give any context. There are very few maps and he gives no context to where places are and how far apart they are. I was very disappointed with this book."
2,Initially Entertaining.,The first 70% of the book was entertaining if only a shallow overview. The last 30% read as if it had been written in a hurry. Even more annoying was the author's injection of options stated as facts with nearly no references.
5,"Great gel,","The best gel in the world is no longer produced (Matrix Twisted) so I'm on a quest for a new one. This one provides great body and shine, is very light and seems to be absorbed by the hair. It doesn't do what Matrix did (you had all that and could twist and spike your hair while it was still soft and touchable), but a good styling paste can fix that.I don't think this gel would hold a style on it's own, but with a paste or wax it works very well."
1,this movie stinks!!!,"This is the most unrealistic movie I've seen with horrid special effects. There were some effects that were good but they went too far overboard on the dramatics of things blowing up, people falling from heights, and of course explosions. The best thing I can compare this to would be the original godzilla, only godzilla has better effects, and was more believable than this movie. I could only watch 1/2 the movie before I had to shut it off. If you still have a morbid desire to buy this movie do yourself a favor and rent it ..."
1,Horrible,"I had to give a star. This movie isn't worthy enoungh to have a star. The plot is unrealstic, the start of the movie has nothing to do with the rest of the movie. Scenes are unrealstic, it's just dumb and waist of money I don't know why I rented it. The cover of the movie looks cool and thats it."
1,This Movie [Disappoints],"The Story Line is Bad, Terrible Acting, Bad Script, Very Unrealistic, I would have given it a 0 star if that option was available. It took me two days to completely struggle through the pain of watching this movie, and I rented it. Unless you want to see how the fire services do not operate do not buy this movie!! BTW, the back cover of the movie case explains a total different movie and is completely unrelated to this movie."
5,its X-Com what more could you ask for?,this is the perfect culmination of the original trilogy and i must say it is a must buy for any X-commer or strategy fan. X-com will go in my book as a game with one goal but infinite possibilities. next to master of orion 2 this is the meaning of replay value. thank the heavens for microprose.
3,F 50?,These were great frames untill the -1 fell off where is read F-150.Now my rear frame reads F 50.
1,WARNING,The Kindle Edition referred to on this page is not the Peter Oswald translation. Not sure why it would be treated like that. Bait and switch? Or just digital ignorance.
3,"At Last, A Worthwhile Mainstream Poetry Anthology","This is the first poetry anthology published by a university or commercial press that covers just about the full range of poetry, as I know it. True, in many areas (e.g., pluraesthetic poetry, or poetry that mixes expressive modalities such as visual poetry) it's twenty or more years behind the times, but when you compare it to such duds as David Lehman's Wilbur-to-Ashbery ""best American poetry"" anthologies, which are forty years behind the times on all fronts, and the Norton thing on ""post-modernist poetry,"" which is only within twenty years of the times in its inclusion of specimens of ""sprung-grammar poetry"" (my term for what most people refer to as ""language poetry""), it's hard to fault it for that. Hence, I recommend it to all serious readers of poetry"
4,the mixtape legacy continues,"In the latest installment of the mixtape series, volume 5 continues the tradition of sick handles and unreal dunks, but offers nothing new to the bball public. The music for this mixtape is tight, but the dvd doesn't offer as much extras like the Collecter's Edition DVD Vol 1-4. This is a good buy for those who like to collect the mixtapes, and those who have never seen the and1 mixtapes before.PS-Keep your eyes peeled for the girl with ankle-breaking crossover in vol. 5."
3,"Been there, done that...","I own the DVD of Volumes 1 - 4 collected and now Vol. 5. I can't say which volume is the best, but 5 isn't it. If you have never seen any of the And 1 Mixtapes, pick this one up to see some sick handles, dimes, and dunks, but if you've seen And 1 Mixtapes before, there is nothing remarkable here."
5,MUST HAVE FOR REAL BALLERS,"If you have ever seen any of the other And1 mixtapes and liked them your collection will not be complete without Vol. 5 because they have all the and1 players plus some new ones that make the DVD interesting. Skip, Hotsauce, and AO are still killing defenders and the dunkers are still doing awesome dunks especially main event. So go ahead and get the tape and you want regret it. Its one of the best yet."
3,"Same old, same old","Nothing really new here, maybe a move or two. If you have the older volumes it's not worth buying this one."
2,No Surprise This Book Is Out Of Print,"Written by Thomas William Simpson - the kind of moniker only an author would use - 'The Editor' is, quite ironically, in need of an editor. My paperback copy clocked in at over 360 pages of poorly written dribble. There's a lot of filler here, and over a hundred pages of redundant material could be excised. The author needlessly writes the story as though it were an excerpt from the main's character's journal, a literary device Simpson probably employed as a way to hide his poor writing skills.Though its billed as a horror novel, 'The Editor' mainly focuses on the dysfunctional romance between a grieving man and a middle-aged blind woman. There are very little thrills to be found here. The title hints at the book's final twist, that of an unreliable narrator. The twist doesn't work as it contradicts everything that came before it. By ending the novel with a such cheap shock, Simpson negates whatever investment the audience had in the characters."
2,"Poor book, poor writer, poor Ellen","Well at first you will think that is an excellent book, I can't tell you why I finished the book it really doesn't worth it, nevertheless the finish of the book is excellent but you can imagine the end when you are at half of the book. The main story could be written in half of the pages of the book and when you reach the end you just can't believe that the police and all the people who lived with Adam didn't know what he did.Poor Ellen and all the women that have to live like her."
3,PREDICTABLE,"the author writes with lots of prose and because it is not original becomes wearing. the plot - was easy to figure out and that was way before the halfway mark. I cannot give this five stars because it reminded me too much of The Year of the Widow by John Irving. maybe there was supposed to be something ""ironic"" about the title and the main character actually revising accounts - this is a old method that did not work, because this book was not tight, nor suspenseful. It was drawn out with definitely not enough character development."
3,Profound Thinker,"Merton readily admits that the content of No Man Is An Island is rather simplistic. So it follows that most of the content seems elementary. Additionally, he frequently lapses to vague ramblings of general topics, like hawks hunting--always circling without so much as flapping a wing, but never swooping in to strike. The electronic format leaves much to be desired, what with the frequent grammatical and spelling errors (e.g. ""five"" or ""fives"" should be understood as ""live"" and ""lives"" respectively).However, he demonstrates profound wisdom and provides a few choice gems regarding some major tenets of the Christian faith."
5,Affirming Human Potential,"In the time when nationalism and self-interests are becoming the ""family values"" of this century, Merton offers a sharp criticism of believing that communal responsibility is no longer a value for Christianity (or humanity for that matter). Insisting that all persons are connected through a spiritual reality (later colored in Christian theology of the Holy Spirit), a concern of the ""other"" should be a dominant concern for the Christian. Though some are concerned they might not be praying enough, studying Bible, etc, Merton affirms that the second part of this equation is devotion to humanity and its welfare.Unlike prior Christian theologians that place dominant concerns to man's latent ability to overcome original sin, overt obsessions with sexual sin, and need for a return to those ""horse and buggy"" realities, Merton offers a differing view of Christian principles that empower the individual towards co-creating with G-d while affirming humanities potential for good."
5,"Not Just for Catholic Christians, This Book Is for Everyone!","I couldn't put this book down and have grown to love the writings of Thomas Merton better than some Protestant books I own. His words speak elegantly of the love of Christ, the beauty of His Church, and many other deep spiritual truths. His books were not merely written, but inspired every step of the way!"
4,Good.,"I bought this for my friend as a wedding present. He really enjoyed it. It is hard at times to get through because of the content, but an over all good read."
3,No Man Is an Island,Book opens one's mind to think of their life. There are many deep truths that are given to the reader. Sometimes is heavy reading for the normal reader who is not familiar with a theological viewpoint.
3,An Enjoyable Read,"I will start by saying that I picked up the book out of curiosity, I am not a Christian, and have no background in theology. Having said that, I enjoyed this book.It is engaging and well written. It is also a relaxing read as the subject matter is essentially the proper way to love, hope, have faith, and give charity. I think that the author's view becomes clearer over the whole book and through repeated readings. He has a strong vision that is well worth understanding.Though I liked the book, I felt that I was reading it as an outsider. I think the book is directed at spiritual co-travelers and it would probably be truly enriching for someone on a similar path."
1,"OH, NO WAY IS THIS FOR REAL !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","Wish I could have rated this 0 stars. HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE, and did I mention itsH O R R I B L E !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I have 2 other Amira Mor DVDs and can attest to them being absolutely awful as well. (thankfully they were a gift from somebody, so I didn't waste my own money on them)This woman CAN NOT DANCE TO SAVE HER LIFE ! Her rhythm is awful, the way she dances is more like a stripper, not the art form that bellydance really should be.Amazon carries some wonderful videos put out by Natural Journeys, such as the Veena & Neena videos, and the Rania videos. Buy those instead, you'll be glad you did. Don't waste your money on Amira Mor garbage."
3,Not current,"While there is a great deal of information that is helpful, the 2006 edition is not current. Out of date information includes; IRA contribution levels and long term capital gains periods. Furthermore there are mistakes in several explanations of the exam questions. You definitely will need another resource that is current.Believe the warning and disclaimer that the author and publisher give. Perhaps Amazon should include that on the sales information page."
2,This book is full of mistakes,"Be careful with this book. It is loaded with errors. I have tried to contact the publisher but got no response. Some of the errors are blatant and some are not so obvious. For those with no prior financial knowledge, this book could mislead you and cause you to get some answers wrong on the test. I suspect the reason for the errors is because an updated edition was not fully proofread."
1,"Outdated, Save your money",This book is so outdated that the customer support reps are not contracted to help you with it.The software that comes with the book is not supported by current editions of windows.The regulations tested on the series 7 change regularly and this book is not current.Save your money.Save your money.Save your money!
3,"Ok, but there are better ones out there","This book can help you but some of the info is outdated,I recommend the Dummies version over this one."
2,Buyer Beware: CD-Rom does not work with windows XP,And you won't know it until you get it. I was depending on those tests. The book is ok so far.
3,Good style...,"When I listen to Slaughter & The Dogs it reminds me of some proto-punk bands like the New York Dolls, but when I hear them live they are on their own way, I mean, they sound as fast as they can. (For example, Live At The Roxy Club). Boston Babies has been covered by G.B.H. which is a humble tribute to them.Great punk band with a few records to count on."
4,Very Nice and clean.,"Just got this today and I'm very pleased. Sturdy construction, draws slide easily.Positive:It comes with soft padding on the inside, which is very nice because you don't have to go out and buy the non-slip stuff, spend time cutting it to fit, etc. Very nice feature which I wasn't expecting.Negative:You have to have the top lid open in order to open the bottom draws. Not hard by any stretch, but a little annoying. I'm going to figure out someway to disable that.It's a great box for the price. If you can't go big or more expensive, it's a terrific tool box that will be used for years to come."
2,latch and handle buckle easily,"At first I though this would be a heavy duty tool box but when it arrived, i was a little disappointed at the build quality of the box. I found the handle to be very weak and not a safe way to carry this box once filled with my tools. The two front latch does cannot handle the weigh and will buckle with very little stuff inside. I would consider a different box if you are a mobile person and require frequent moves. If you just need it in the garage then this might work for you.Instead I went with this one from sears which seems more reliable and sturdier.The Craftsman 26 in. Power Latch Tool Box"
4,Good drawer tool chest,I really like this tool chest. I could not come even close at this price anywhere that I looked. I transfered my tools into it and the drawers still open on the rollers easily. Thanks for a great price on a really good product.
2,Ugh,This dark ambient stuff just isn't for me. This album has some high points but is of inconsistent quality even within tracks to be worth struggling through.
4,Decent edition,"The Kalmus editions are reproductions of the 19th century Bach Geselschaft edition. Because of these, there are some (not many) note errors, the ordering of pieces is not up-to-date, and there is some alto clef. However, if you are looking for an inexpensive edition of the Bach organ works that is fairly decent I would highly recommend this edition."
4,DataLink,Understanding of transmission modes of the information - important moment in in our life! Thanks!
3,Probably not the best,"After looking for a garden cart, my husband and I chose this one. It is not constructed of the best material and was difficult to put together. Now that it is together, I find it quite heavy for me to pull."
2,Swisher 7-cubic foot garden cart,"Disappointed in the quality of the Swisher Garden cart expecially the axel which was deformed on one end and should never have been shipped with the unit. Also, the wheels are too far forward and should have been placed back a tad for better weight distribution. On the positive side the unit was easy to put together although the instructions weren't always clear. If you're looking for a cheap garden cart then this is the unit for you."
5,diorama success!,"My daughter used the Schleich African elephants (male) to make a beautiful diorama for her Grade 3 science ""habitat"" unit."
5,The Game is good and it worked fine but....,Buyers should know that this is the UK version of Zeus and will not work with the US version of the Expansion pack. Otherwise this product works fine and I have had no problems.
3,just simple stuff,"Very mediocre musicianship but very entertaining. If this band could have just been a bit more skilled, they could have really took off. Worth a listen, but don't go out of your way."
1,LIFELESS MELODIES THAT ARE NOT UP TO EARL KLUGH STANDARDS.,"I SAW EARL KLUGH IN CONCERT LAST SUMMER. I WALKED AWAY FROM THE CONCERT GLOWING WITH THE MELODY LINES STILL PLAYING IN MY HEAD. THE MUSICIANSHIP WAS TREMENDOUS. THE PLAYERS WERE TIGHT. YOU DIDN'T WANT IT TO END. I COULDN'T WAIT FOR HIS NEXT CD. WELL, THIS SOUNDS LIKE A DIFFERENT ARTIST. THE CD IS LIFELESS AND BORING. HE USES HIMSELF AND TWO OTHER PLAYERS FOR MOST OF THE CUTS, THUS THE SOUND IS NOT FULL AND RICH. NOTHING SOUNDS UNIQUE. PASS ON THIS ONE. I WISH I HAD."
3,"Not Now, Not AGAIN","I'm a great fan of Earl Klugh, and a great fan of Roberta Flack, but there comes a point when we start to wonder. This is nice music, worthy of purchase, but . . . and it's a big But . . . are we challenged? Earl, are you challenged? We will stick with you, Earl . . .and we will have confidence that more will come from your great talent. More and better. Praise!"
2,Standard affair..,"Contrary to what one of the reviewer said, this disc *is* run-of-the-mill smooth jazz. There are no big surprises here, just another Earl Klugh album. If you like his other stuff, then by all means get this one too."
1,Harmful product!,"I was very dissappointed in this product. I chose it over other cases because I thought it looked more durable and of higher quality. I was wrong, after insterting my brandnew ipod into the case I noticed a lot of lines running vertically down the screen, I though that the case was just dirty so I removed the ipod and found that THE CASE ACTUALLY SCRATCHED the ipod. And not one or two scratches, dozens. I thought this was very ironic considering why I bought the case in the first place; don't make the same mistake as me!"
4,"If you were a fan of the 2nd season, here lies redemption...","This is closer to what the 2nd season should have been, with evil villains and a few questions answered. Is it as good as the first season? No, not even that close. Is it much better then the 2nd? Yes, and well worth watching again.While I can not recommend this to everyone, if you could watch season two without grumbling (much) then season 3 will probably be a light at the end of the tunnel. If season two was complete garbage and turned you off the series completely, I'm not sure if this will bring you back."
5,LOVE IT,Was a great addition to the first two seasons but I would like to find the fourth season. Very unhappy the series ended!
5,slight confusion,"i am an avid Heroes fan but i am wondering if i am the only one confused about one small thing. When season 3 finally started i was so excited. as we all know the premier was slow in coming, but about 11 episodes in, the opening switched for saying volume 3 to volume 4 but there was never a season finale and no break between 3 and 4. As the season contined through the now volume 4, i began looking for volume 3 so i could order it but the websites all said the show was still that season!! So with the finale being yesterday and as usual had a preview of the next season, my question is how many people are going to be confused on whether we are about to be in season 4 or 5?? Somebody fix that please!!!"
3,Bad first disc,"The first disc was bad. I start viewing it and except for the first part, I could not view the last ones. The other disc were good. So I rate it 3."
2,Not as great as I hoped,"I purchased this for a friend for Christmas. Unfortunately when the box set arrived it came damaged from the trip. It wasn't shipped in a very protective way so the corners of the box set itself were pretty messed up. My friend did get around to watch the DVDs till about a month later, everything seemed fine until he got to the 3rd disk which would begin to play but then would constently skip and freeze. We tried this on at least 3 different DVD players with the same result. Later I emailed them about this and recieved no response. I wasn't too happy with them or the product."
3,"a""little"" bit constructed",a little bit constructed. If the writers have trouble to find a character an old one revive. But still ok.
3,Change Heroes to Sylar,"The ONLY reason I gave this crappy, nerd soap opera 3 stars was because of SYLAR. He is the only good thing about this show (kudos Zachary Quinto) and thank God this season was full of him. The first half was a combination of terrible and just OK. I am a big fan of letting that stupid Claire just DIE; her and Pertrelli's mom. The best part was that you saw that Sylar was made that way and that it was Elle and Noah's fault; the worst was everything else. The second part was a hot, terrible mess; but there were lots of Sylar activities. I have never watched a show where I wanted everyone BUT the bad guy to die; the only thing that came good out of this season was learning that there can be a villain that almost wins. However, I do believe that we have Zachary Quinto awesome acting talents to thank for that."
1,Never Got it!,I ordered this product from a seller (Electronix) through Amazon and I never did recieve it. I hope they kick Electronix off their site! Amazon has been great in helping me get my money back.
4,On time and in great condition,"my product showed up on time and in great condition order was handeled with great proffesionalism, would use thier service again"
1,just ridicilous,"Even if I bought season 3 heroes blu ray format, I'm very bored when I'm watching the episodes. Everybody was planning something in a very strange way. Brothers were killing each other ? which was very weird. My mind just didn't accept the events in the episodes although I find very good the series supernatural, sarah connor chronicles."
5,Heroes DVD,"I found season three of Heroes very interesting, the characters all seemed to reverse their positions, if they were bad before~They were good this season. All in all, a great DVD!"
1,What was One My Favorite Show. . .,"Heroes was the most exciting show in years. Finally! Then the end of Season 2 and ESPECIALLY Season 3 ruined the entire experience for me.I will treasure my Season One Box Set, but I will save my money for quality TV on DVD- which does not include Season 3 of Heroes."
4,Sesson 3 Heros,This will turn your Heros upside down.Lots of change and different directions.some character changes.....You have to see this to understand season 4.
3,Inconsistent Characters,"Even with an interesting new premise with ""Villains"" against ""Heroes"" you still come to sense that this show didn't know how to craft a good story for its characters. Constantly we have to watch characters flip-flop worse than any politician in a heated race. Peter, Sylar, Hiro, Mohinder, Claire, Noah, it doesn't matter who I label because essentially every character makes ridiculous decisions that feel forced for drama's sake and overall doesn't even create an interesting pay off."
2,Not the correct Episode,"Love Heroes - disappointed can't find this episode. Everywhere I have looked episode 16 ""Building 26"" is being replayed as episode 17 ""Cold Wars"". It's the same here too, only difference is you're paying for it here."
5,Great comeback from season 2,Heroes season 3 has all you would expect from the show. If you liked season 1 then you're going to love this one. I know season 2 was not as good as it could've been due to the strike but this season completely makes up for it. Season 3 is great all the way through. A lot of questions are answered and of course new questions arrive with the awesome cliffhanger ending.
2,heroes love it,very good but the cd s arrived with a problem on the number 5 who get scratch. hard to read in the dvd player
4,this season is ok,"Season 3 started slowly but most of us heroes fans were so desperate after a 9 month vacation(due to the writer's strike), that we took what we could get. the writers have not been able to recapture the magic of season 1. they keep bringing in too many new characters that just takes away from the harmony of the original cast. one of the plueses of this season is that sylar has a bigger role and they finally figured out that angela petrelli could be a major player. i love the show as a whole and will be around for season 4, 5 and 6 hopefully."
5,Heroes - A Clear And Present Danger,"I watched the television series, Heroes"", and liked it so I bought the series dvd!! I bought two seasons of the of the series!!"
1,my shipment is 5 days late and I don't know how to contact you.,I am not sure how to find you. My shipment was posted to arrive on the 18th. It is now the 23d and it has not arrived. :( Is anybody out there to contact me?
2,complicated,"a) huge scratch on disc1, amazon sent replacement quicky, thanks.b) story is a bit complicated & not exciting as before."
1,Replacement DVDs never received,"The first set of DVDs received were defective. A follow-up email promised to replace them promptly. That was November 2. To date, the replacement DVDs have not materialized, and my credit card has been charged."
2,"Boy, I sure hate to give this low rating...","I have so enjoyed the series up to this volume. I love the stories of how people are waking up to their inner ""giftings"" and the struggle to find their place in this world. It's a now message for this generation - a harbinger of things to come. Lost people looking for redemption is never a false story.The twisting of heroes and villians is way overdone. I can't deny the relevancy of the Heroes' struggle with darkness. ""Am I a hero or a villian?"" ""Am I living up to my gifts?"" These are great questions and it used to be uplifting to watch each character's struggle with their brokeness. The main failure of this series (volume 3) is that the story now completely blurs good vs. evil. Calling a bad guy good without redemption is a false story.I simply can't enjoy the story anymore. Hollywood frequently twists good and bad, but this is excessively dark. Our world needs affirmation of goodness - especially in the dark times."
4,"Strong start, but a weak finish",The storyline at the beginning of the season was great. Halfway through the season the storyline changed. So far the second storyline is not as good. We'll see what season 4 has to bring
4,I really liked the series.,"It was good to see the episodes that I missed. The transition from villain to hero was interesting. Sadly, there is no season 5."
4,Perhaps gone on too long,"Few series can continue for more than two seasons without experiencing problems. This isn't quite the same level of quality as the preceding two seasons, but it's still worth watching."
5,As good as I hoped,"I just recently got into Heroes because a friend of mine wouldn't shut up about this show. I bought the first 2 seasons on sale here at Amazon. I fell in love instantly with season 1. The characters are great, casting is good, and the way they tell a story is fantastic. Season 3 kept the love alive very well. I love the villians being added more and more, Sylar had a great struggle in this that I liked to see, although I don't think it should have been such quick changes to his personality, it makes him seem weak in that respect. I can't wait to see season 4 episodes, I hope they start having all out wars and we see the public react more. I guess I will have to wait and see. If you are a Heroes fan, this should be a no brainer for you, if you are not a Heroes fan, go back and start season 1 again and watch till your eyes bleed, you will learn to love it too."
3,no glue?,"the dvds were great, not scratched or anything. they were brandnew, but all of them fell outta the box b/c i guess they forgot the glue? the little plastic sides that are actually glued to the cardboard....yeh, it was kinda of a pain, but i have a hot glue gun so itz not that bad, it was just unexpected so it annoyed me. lol."
3,need tighter script,"ok show. but, only ok. not as good as the first year. the little girl who could find people - that the policeman adopted - was suddenly gone. boom! and no one noticed? not even her adopted father? like ""chuck"" on Happy Days"". a show like this needs better scripts [than most shows] to be as good as ""regular"" shows because of its ""si-fi"" ""super-hero"" story lines and characters. when a show like this makes ""blunders"" they show up more than they would in a more ""regular"" t.v. program. i could name more ""blunders"" but other reviewers already have. P.S. strangely, the acting seems to be really good in spite of the flaws."
4,Still Good - Recommended,"""Heroes - Season 3"" did start somewhat weak, but picked up around the middle of season. As in previous seasons, there are multiple plot threads running concurrently and it is now easier to see how many of them are interconnected due to more familiarity with the core characters.The strong collection of actors are a great asset to this series and really helped to retain viewership through the slow second season and into the beginning of season three. When the plots and scripts are good they really make this show worth watching.We enjoy watching Heroes on DVD since it gives us flexibility around our family schedules. This is a good release and the DVD extras provide some decent insight to how the episodes come together.Recommended for fans of the series.CFH"
5,Wit and Wisdom. Grizzard at his best!,"Ahh...who couldn't like Grizzard? Except if you're a Yankee ;P Wish he was still around to write more. It's the only book of his I read (and won't be the last, I assure you) and I already miss him."
4,Just one problem . . . .,"This is an excellent set over all, and if you are reading this you probably have the first two anyway and are already into the series.My one beef is that two of the episodes on the last disk have BOTH audio tracks in English!! Admittedly I only know a smidgen of Japanese, but it's tough listening to the characters using different voices."
2,One of the worst,"1. The animation is horrible! The first season had better animation than this one. There are many scenes where it looks like they just painted some manga scenes and tilted the screen a little (when Ukyo hits Ranma in episode 1).2. Most of the episodes were rushed stories and pretty much the only episodes that were Manga episodes were the ones in the first two DVDsBuy this DVD if you want to collect Ranma merchandise, but I don't suggest this to be your first box set (it was unfortunately mine). Buy the Random Rhaphsody set, its theme song is great (the name is Zettai part 2) and the made up episodes are funny."
5,A Must Get Set for Ranma Fans - Enter Ukyo,"If you are a Ranma fan this is a must get set. For one thing it continues on from the 2nd season and introduces the very cute Ukyo, another Ranma fiance and an important character in future episodes.There is much less continuity in this season compares to seasons 1 & 2. Some of the episodes are very weak and don't really build on the overall story. However, there are a few very strong episodes must see episodes that reveal very interesting details about the background of key characters such as the relationship between Happosai and Shampoo's great great grandmother. Some episodes are a must see just because they are simply very very funny."
4,Riveting questions,"""This text gives a general description of the properties and characteristics of survival models, and statistical procedures for estimating such models from sample data. Several approaches and applications are considered, including those of actuarial science, clinical survival studies, epidemiology and reliability engineering."" With plenty of worked examples and answers albeit without solutions this book is useful for those studying, survival models, their estimation and application to mortality and other decrements."
5,If you took the Java Language Specification ...,"... and boiled it till only the essentials remained, this is what you'd get. There is no other book as concise and yet as complete. The 2nd edition covers Java 1.5 which addresses the concerns of some other reviewers that it might be outdated. Another reviewer compared it to K&R, which is a good comparison. You could very nearly write a Java compiler based on this book. Companion books include the ""Java Language Specification"" (Gosling, et. al.), and ""Java Rules"" (Dunn)."
1,Insulting,"The title alone is a slap in the face to all serious belly dancers. On her website the video is described as thus: ""will teach how to do a sexy improvisation that will mesmerize your lover and encourage passionate experiences you've only dreamed of."" This seductress image does nothing to help our dance form. If Amira really loved this dance, she would not insult it by making a video like this.Once more, it doesn't even accomplish what it says it will. I showed her supposed seductive dancing clip to my boyfriend and all he did was ask ""what is she doing?"". I told him she was seducing him and he just rolled over and took a nap instead of watching the rest. The dancing is so bad I don't think anyone could get off on it unless they REALLY used their imagination, or had a thing for bad dancing. You can see her performance here: [...]"
2,Not at all what you think,"I have only played the CD 4 times and now it doesnt work. Plus when it did work... it really wasnt all that great. YOu want a workout and a great CD, Get Temple of Jehan Ultimate Bellydance fitness workout."
2,Contemporary Joe Cocker,"This 1997 album from Joe Cocker represents for him a new label, a new position as his own executive producer, and most importantly a settlement into a modern adult contemporary production untouched by the dating elements of his late 80s' and mid 90s' releases. Unfortunately, Across From Midnight is packed with largely unmemorable material, lacking not only in modern or well-known song selections, but most importantly in punctuating interpretative quality."
5,Love Rock and Roll!,"Joe Cocker has not lost his charm for me. His new songs are wonderful. Romantic, Love found and lost great songs for Joe Cocker! I saw him in concert a month ago and he was great and this just made me know why I have loved him since I first saw him in the 60's, Wonderful music and voice to listen to. Long live Rock and Roll!!!!!!!"
4,Fan of Joe,"I bought this CD to get one song, N'oubliez Jamais, great song. I needed it to help complete a kick azz Joe Cocker section of my music library. If You like Joe the rest of the songs are OK. For the price I paid, I'm happy."
1,"color off, not able to exchange, return only","I ordered this for Christmas for my sister. The color was too orange for Christmas and so she couldn't use it with her dishes, which are red and green. I would like to have exchanged it for a Fiesta red butter dish, but was told by the company, Cooking.com, that I can't, she just has to return it, get the credit and then I have to order the other dish. I will not shop with them again, and why is a Christmas item orangish instead of bright Christmas red? Not happy."
5,A Must See!,"I like that this movie showed many angles on abortion. If you are pro choice or pro life I think you should see this movie because it will let you see several situations involving abortion. Abortion isn't as simple as ""yes"" or ""no."" There are many gray areas and this movie explores them. I totally recommend this movie."
3,Decent watch,"I like this movie, it has a lot of controversial things going on in it with a lot of big hollywood names. I wish it went more into details about the decisions that were made. All in all a decent movie to kill time."
4,"Yes, a bit political, but...","I found this movie a bit political, yes, but it was a very well done movie. I am pro-life and did not find this movie offensive in any way. I felt for the women portrayed here. Those who complain about the political approach are only mad because it is not their belief. If you feel very strongly against abortion, DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE. Everyone else, watch and think."
2,A Biased Film ??,"They have taken 3 stories and put the women in a worst case scenario. I felt like this film was really trying to push ""Pro-Abortion"" down my throat, and not very subtley. They are using high drama and emotions to try to influence those who question allowing abortions as a ""convenience"" for a woman. Very few women have abortions due to life threatening situations. In reality, most abortions are a matter of convenience. Period. Why not be honest about it ??? I wouldn't recommend this film, but if you are really pro-abortion, you would probably like it. This film is biased, but if you realize that up front, then it's okay."
1,Am I supposed to feel sorry for these women?,"Okay, putting aside my pro-life persuasions, this flick is anything but thought-provoking. Maybe in 1960s it would've been ""controversial"" and ""groundbreaking"", but in 1990s... Whom are you kidding? It's next to impossible to shock or outrage people these days. There is nothing unique about the three situations presented in the movie. Three middle-class broads get knocked up because of their irresponsibility. I have a hard time feeling compassion for stupid and careless people. As usual, those traits go along with weakness and cowardice. If Cher wanted to the viewers to feel sorry for the characters, she should've made them more... victimized? I can understand and pity to a certain degree a junkie or a prostitute, a woman whose situation is desperate in the first place. But when three middle-class broads find themselves ""inconvenienced"" by their unplanned pregnancies, I can't find any compassion in my heart."
2,Confusing,"I buy books to learn something from them. When I bought this book I thought I'd learn something about ""Bedside Manners"". The book was so confusing because the auther never used quotes when someone was saying something and half the time you had to reread paragraphs to understand who or which person was the one saying something. Very confusing for an author that was supposed to be such a poet. I got little educational value from it."
2,Too pop and not enough cajun.,I was looking for some music off the beaten path when I found this and bought it full of hope that I'd get some fine Cajun music. This kid is talented but is making the mistake of trying to be too mainstream and accessible. I wish it had been more electic and less pop.
2,bullet for a star,"weak story linepoor plotmostly ""run of the mill"" storyIt is a quick, easy read but leaves no impressiondo not recommend"
4,bullet for a star,This mystery book was set in the old Hollywood studio days and gave you a taste of how life at the studio was. The book was humorous and kept you reading.
5,I love anything Kaminsky,"Up front I must tell you I'm a sucker for anything from Stuart Kaminsky. So there, the bias is out. The world of a Moscow police squad in the Rostnikov books and the Lieberman and Fonesca series are just so fun to read; but Toby Peters has a special spot. !940's and WWII is going on and Toby is a private dick in LA! What a recipe! But, all his clients are the greats of Hollywood! I just love the descriptions of old LA and the characters. Kaminsky could do characters better than any of the modern authors. The tongue in cheek parts about the famous actors and actresses had just the right touch of seriousness and the plot will do justice for the characters he created. I haven't finished all the Tobys yet. I cherish them like a great dessert now that we have lost the great Stuart Kaminsky."
3,Old story,Although I read the book I was not impressed with the contents. The ending was so far out of the realm.
2,Bullet for a Star,"This book was fun to read. It won't be for everyone. It was set in Hollywood area where I grew up so places and names were very familiar. Older readers from this time period will enjoy, but maybe not so many younger readers. Try it and see."
3,Lame,This book never did draw me in. The use of famous old movie stars did nothing to salvage an otherwise ridiculous story.
5,Bullet for a Star,"I enjoyed this book. It was well paced, good character development. I will be looking for more books in the series, so I hope it does continue."
3,Container arrived broken,"This might have been a lovely product, but the plastic jar arrived cracked in a very oily box.Still had sugar scrub in it, but but lacked most of the oil. Unlike salt scrubs, doesn't sting just-shaved legs."
1,"A complete rip-off - outdated, focused on New Jersey; a complete waste","This is easily the worst purchase I've ever made from Amazon. At just 104 pages, AUTOMOBILE INSURANCE MADE SIMPLE is priced at $0.19 a page. At this rate, the new Harry Potter would cost $150, and you're likely to find just as much worthwhile insurance information in THE DEATHLY HALLOWS as you will in this book. Not only is everything contained in AUTOMOBILE INSURANCE MADE SIMPLE common sense, outdated, or available online; the book is written for New Jersey citizens only - despite the fact that this is not prominently disclosed. Even New Jersey consumers will be wasting their time with this pitiful excuse for a ""guide,"" since their state laws have recently been overhauled. Quite literally, this book is not worth the paper it's printed on."
4,Blessed DVD,It's truly a blessing to see and hear young men making a true stand for the Gospel of Jesus Christ. My family and I really enjoy it. Blessed be the name of the Lord for Righteous Riders standing for Righteousness!!!!
4,Not as good as Van Zant II ... but very close!!,"I bought this CD after almost wearing out my Van Zant II CD.I'm a big Lynard Skynard fan and make every concert when they come to this area. Also like 38 Special (but not as much as LS), so I knew I'd enjoy this CD. As I mentioned in my subject line, this CD isn't a good as Van Zant II ... but still would highly recommend it. If I could have given this CD 4 3/4 stars I would have ... since that's what I think it should be rated."
5,Have you seen my mother,This book was recommended for my son by the Speech Audiologist for his difficulty in talking he absolutely loves the bright colors and the animals on each page. Great work
1,Cheap and flimsy,No need to waste your money on this set. It looks much nicer in the picture than it actually is. The case doesn't even have hinges.
3,Not a bad read,"Written in 97 leaves this material a bit dated. This book reads much like a modern travel blog would read, with short chapters. There were many. Times while reading I felt the subjects could have been delved into with a bit more detail. It's not a bad short read for 0.99 cents."
3,An Interesting Book,Found book to be an interesting read. Found price to be affordable. Liked author's style of writing. An entertaining read.
4,"He had 2 Degrees in Bebop, a PhD in Swing ...","Lowell was Da Man! Never got to see him in person but I never pass up anything associated with him. Get all the official Little Feat CDs (including their excellent and neglected post-Lowell George releases) and Thanks I'll Eat It Here before you get this, but get this anyway! It shows off George's brilliant songwriting in the hands of very sympathetic interpreters. I understand a Japanese version features Dr. John and others and includes the signature song Dixie Chicken, but you won't miss it. (There are plenty of covers of that one out there anyway.)"
2,"""It is not known about Lowell George""","This was a very disappointing book. Rarely do I fail to finish a book but I found myself flipping pages looking for something of interest half way through it. It is a song by song, album by album analysis of Lowell George's work with little insight into his life. Even his death was matter of factly covered in a brief few paragraphs. And what really irked me is that the author keeps saying, ""is not known about Lowell George..."". Well if the author didn't know any more about him than he does why is he writing a book about him? If you want to read good books on rock I would suggest Hotel California, Room Full of Mirrors (Jimi Hendrix), Skydog (Duane Allman), or even The Dylan Chronicales, but don't waste your money on this book!"
3,Morrison's kind of blues,"The latest Van Morrison's album, not the best, but not the worst. Songs like Stranded, Celtic New Years and Gypsy In My Soul are beautiful standard compositions in the same way as Steal My Heart Away (2002) or Days Like This (1995). However you will not find a Moondance, a Have I Told You Lately or a Someone Like You on this CD. The arrangements are habitually well done with less horns parts than the 2002's Down The Road album. It's always the same Morrison's voice and singing style, with more traditional blues rhythm. In a way, this CD sounds like to the 1993's Too Long In Exile album, with a additional light big band touch.Nothing really new under the sun, but If you're a fan of Morrison's kind of blues, this one is a good shot. And thanks that Morrison is back with Polydor. The last album, What's Wrong With This Picture?, was on the EMI label with their copy control devise and that's why I didn't buy it.Magic Time deserves 3 stars."
4,Important lessons,"My daughter thoroughly enjoyed this book, especially because it addresses the animal issues she is very concerned about in her own surroundings. Too many texts either sidestep or sugarcoat the use of animals in experimentation; this one tells students what it's really like, an honesty that lets them make critical choices about an important societal issue."
1,propaganda disquised as a teen novel,"It speaks volumes that the radical animal rights group PETA has chosen this as a book for holiday giving for young people. The message about the use of animals in biomedical research is heavy handed, simplistic and wrong."
2,"Laughing in the Wind, Vol. 4: Xiao Ao Jiang Nu",I was not happy with this purchase. The sound system and picture was not good. I am not sure but the DVD from episode 36-40 did not look like the original but a copy. I was so upset that it was not good quality as expected. I was watching series on NetFlix but they were missing episodes 31-40 so I decided to buy it. It cost me more than $45 and it was not worthy it becasue of the quality.
5,Good information with actionable suggestions,I was able to implement the ideas from this book in my call center.
3,Blue Glow in the Dark,The blue isn't as bright as I was expecting but it still glows in the dark and is a very fun belly button ring.
3,Drum Gahu: An Introduction to African Rhythm,"Okay you told me to buy this book from you, When i got it was out the CD, Please tell me why, You will not get what you are told."
2,Another Disappointment,"Another name change required.Like ""LAX:Los Angeles International Airport"", this book on ORD offers nothing more than pictures of airlines serving this world's busiest gateway. The author might aim to portrait and showcase this busy hub by displaying a plethora of pictures of aircrafts, unfortunately omitting all information regarding history, operation, and behind-the-scene aspects of ORD.Don't expect a layout of airport and its architecture. This is an airline guide."
4,"Good, small garbage can","This is a small garbage can that has a removable liner. It also fits the plastic bags you get at all the stores now, but it is small. It came well packaged and quickly. Cooking.com is a good website and excellent company. I've gotten a few things from them and never have a problem."
5,Keeps the cat out,"Needed a small wastebasket for the bathroom because one of our cats loves Q-tips -- the extra ugly ones with mascara are his favorite. This size is a little big for our bathroom needs so I am considering moving it to a recycling location (cat food cans, naturally) and purchasing the next smaller size. Sleek look. Great design, looks and performs like it is of good quality. Not easily tipped over and cat proof. Smooth action. Perfectly snug fitting lid."
2,too small for anything other than dryer lint,"Since I own it, I will keep it for when I have a large enough laundry area to accommodate this but otherwise, I wish I hadn't spent the money."
3,This size fills up quickly,I use this for tissues in my bedroom so I don't mind the small size. It was the cheapest one at Target. I am the only one who likes it because I only use it for tissues. Get a bigger one if your needs are bigger than for tissues.
2,Ended up skimming this one,"I've not read Mary Balogh before, and after reading this one, was tempted to stop. However, other reviews claim this book is unusual. I was unimpressed by the female character. I very much wanted to sympathize with her, and of course hated the baddy right off. Unfortunately, she continuously rolled over, not standing up for herself and gaining any sort of backbone until the end of the book. I was distressed that after her four year stint as a divorced lady (during which time she recieved what amounts to regency counseling) and gaining some peace, she returns to her previous powerlessness. While some of the lack of power is believable and understandable, especially given the time frame and circumstance, her inability to protect herself, and her refusal to act responsibly to protect two other young women, left me frustrated with the character and skimming just to get the book done."
2,A real downer,"This book did not work for me.I knew the subject matter going in, but was surprised that Balogh seemed to have spent more time on the molestation scenes than she did on the consensual interactions between the hero and heroine.I also found the hero judgemental and harsh. His fear that the heroine would contaminate his sister and fiance in Bath really tuned me off him and he never regained my regard.Balogh did a good job in coneying the vulnerabiilty of a woman alone in that society, but is was just too much. Maybe this could have been rectified by showing scenes of a re-united couple reintering society. So much time was spent on the pain, but not much was made of the joy.The story would have been better served if the writer had instilled a greater balance, preferably with the scaled tipped in favor of happiness."
3,Fizzled out in the end,"I was totally glued to this book at the beginning. I love tortured heroes, wronged heroines and a steamy encounters and I thought this book was going to have all this. But I am afraid I was a little disappointed in the end. I think the main problem was that the end was dragged out. By half way through the book I was sick of the heroine and how she was being manipulated by the villain. I know that circumstances were heavily against her, but in the end, she felt too weak for me to really like her. And the other thing I didn't like was that George suddenly changed from hating Sarah to loving her without any real explanation of why he changed his mind. So sadly, not a keeper for me."
5,Beautiful Music,"What a great CD. Beautiful songs, arrangements, and Fulop's wonderful voice make this the CD I most enjoy listening to. Bravo!"
4,Works as expected,"I was on the lookout for a cheap portable DVD player for my 2 year old. When i saw this one, it looked attractive but could not find much reviews on it. So i decided to gamble and purchased the unit for $100 after MIR (still to come). I have been using it for last 3 weeks while travelling in car and airplane. I used both car charger and battery ( both come with the unit) and worked great. I also attached it to the TV to watch a movie which was not working on my regular 5 Disc Sony DVD Player. I also struggled a little bit with putting the battery to the unit as it required more muscle power than i anticipated. Overall happy with the product so far.Pros: Good picture quality,Good sound volume, Sturdy Unit, Light weight. Good battery lifeCons: Does not come with a bag, battery snap-on little cumbersome,Did not get a reply from Advueu while trying to find out about how to snap the battery to the unit."
3,Best if it was priced at $80,"There are few things I like about this DVD and a few that I don't.What I like:1. Battery life - up to 3.5 hrs2. Sturdy structure - good if you've got small kids who want to operate the unit3. Autovolt (100 ~ 240v) you can take it anywhere in the world.What I don't like:1. It's not multi-region, it's locked to region 1.2. Does not play DVD-RW3. Battery size -- battery is almost 20% of the total size of the unit. However, you can remove the bulky battery if you're using it in a car4. Picture is so-so(...)"
2,Battery life,"Got this as a gift and it worked fine for about 2 months. Now the battery doesn't hold a charge and I can't find one to replace it. Works well plugged into an outlet, which defeats the ""portable"" point of the whole thing."
1,CHEAP ... 1x use DVD Player,"I purchased this player for my 2 year old for a plane flight.The unit worked well once (for a duration of 1 hour) and stopped working? It was never dropped or mishandled. I thought it might just need another charge, so I recharged overnight to no avail. Basically the unit played one DVD for about an hour and is no longer functioning. It's dead.It's a piece of junk and buyers should beware. I guess you get what you pay for ... and based on the cheap price I should have known. Just hope others can stay clear of this unit by reading this review."
5,Best one so far,This was the best of the series so far. You really felt like you visiting Tibet and can learn a lot about their culture. Duncan's character also grows a lot and faces some difficult decisions.Enjoy.
1,Another thumbs down,"As a recent convert to the Highlander subculture, I am enjoying catching up on what others have been enjoying for 10 years. I *did not* however enjoy this book. It was what no book of its genre should be -- boring."
1,Made in the USA?,I bought this product at a major chain office supply store. Tried to install it but was unsuccessful. Reason being 2 of the 4 bolts that hold the monitor to the mount broke. Went to the local hardware store and bought more of the same bolts. Finally hung the monitor on the wall and the mount sagged. Tried to tighten the mount so the monitor would stay level. This time a major hex bolt broke. The product is made of inferior metal and is very difficult to be useful. I tried to contact the company who made this product since it comes with a 10 year warranty. The company is no longer in business. I would not buy again nor would I recommend to others.
2,Problem,"Most of the stuff in this kit is great. I was surprised by the quality of the camera bag, tripods, cleaner kit etc.The only problem is that it doesn't come with the lens adapter for the Opteka wide angle and teleconverter lenses. I went to a camera store to buy one, but the Canon lens adapter doesn't work with the Opteka 2x teleconverter lens. There isn't enough room for the G7 lens to extend before it bumps into the teleconverter (and puts the camera into damage control shut down mode).The Canon 2x teleconverter (which costs much more), is designed slightly differently so it works with the Canon lens adapter.The Canon lens adapter does work with the Opteka wide angle adapter, but it's disappointing not to be able to use the 2x teleconverter."
3,Just OK,I purchased this a year ago and am growing more disappointed. The wide angle lens gets distorted at the edges very visibly on all shots. The tele lens adds lots of noise and probably just as poor as a digital zoom. The filters are weak at best but add distortion that I'm seeing more as I compare to no filter. I now wish I had gotten a single good filter or put this towards a much better lens.PROS: Cheap - that's about it. They actually don't feel bad and have nice threaded ends so can stack.CONS: Image quality is poor in most cases. PROS don't make up for bad pics.The lenses are OK for snapshots that you post to the Web or print 4x6's but not much more.
5,One of my favorite books ever!,"I bought the first two Drina books in 5th grade out of a catalogue...and I was hooked! The Drina books are great for all kids, but especially for anyone who wants to be a ballerina or loves ballet. This book is about a young girl named Andrina Adamo, also known as Drina Adams, and her struggles to dance and become a ballerina against the wishes of her grandparents. Ballet for Drina is a great book, but it definitely leaves you wishing for more. I've been trying to find the rest of the series ever since, but unfortunately, they're all out of print. :( <<sigh>>"
2,not worth the money,"I read lots of steller reviews about this product about how the ipod is so protected inside etc. Well, this product is extremely heavy and made in ipod twice its size, and the belt clip kept breaking. what would happen is I'd be wearing my ipod on the belt clip and then there would go my ipod in the case on the floor while the belt clip was still attached to my pants. I guess, rhinoskin's protection did help my ipod with stand a few falls, but with a better case it wouldn't be an issue. I returned this product right afterwards."
3,Not exactly scratch proof,"It said scratch proof, but that was a lie...however, I'd rather the case have minor scratches in it than the ipod itself...the waist clip is great though..."
4,Good,But I would like full seasons of this show instead of just 2 seasons being released at a time.PS: The Powerpuff Girl's Complete Series DVD is out though.
5,An imported cartoon great,"""Ed, Edd, n Eddy"" in my opinion was the greatest cartoon I have ever seen on Cartoon Network. A lot of concepts came from the contributions of ""The Three Stooges,"" ""Pink Panther"" and great films and put those concepts in a more appropriate fashion. That was how I saw the cartoon.I am not sure if the final season will air on Cartoon Network, but this could be the only show to have a special ten year anniversary after all of the years, cheers, and tears. I will never forget ""Ed, Edd, n Eddy."" Never. The first season was the best, but what will the last season hold when it gets released?"
5,the triple EDs,"Have loved this show ever since it first came on Cartoon Network and loved the 2nd season on dvd. It was great reliving those episodes and being able to watch them whenever i want. I'm hoping to purchase more of Ed, Edd and Eddy on DVD in the future. Great series and excellent buy on DVD less than 11 dollars...thats a great deal. I'm happy it made its way to DVD and it is a pretty good transition as well, you wont miss a beat from the TV to DVD its all there for everyone to love like so many fans already do. Excellent series & purchase"
2,False Information,"It clearly says ""Product Description All 26 first-season episodes"" When the DVD arrived only to see that there is only 13 episodes on it. Purchase wasn't for me but for someone else, who was disappointed by this as well."
4,Gotta love the Eds,"I watched the series when it first came out and always loved their shanagans. I looked around and saw what kind of seasons I should get and I decided to go with the Ed Edd n' Eddy series. I'm glad I picked my choice because on the second season they have many good episodes I cherished when I was younger. They give 13 entire episodes and bonus features! The reason why I give this DVD four stars is because the quality of the show looks like it's been rendered to a low quality, so they could fit a bunch of episodes onto just two discs. I really don't like and it bugs me when I see this kind of quality on an awesome series. They could of rendered it in a higher quality and put them on 3 or 4 discs, I really don't mind unless the quality is better. I recommend any one to buy these seasons because it was one of the best shows that came on Cartoon Network and they are selling it pretty cheap!"
2,Not worth the money,"Although assembly was cumbersome, it was not that difficult. My yard is a little over 2 acres. In the first use, the middle brace broke in half and the wheels are not nearly as sturdy as they need to be if you have any amount of weight placed on the plugger.All in all, I was not pleased with the performance or durability of this product."
1,Pocket Belt,"The belt pockets are too small, because standard photo IDs & credit cards (CC) are too wide to fit in the pockets. Thus, if you are like me & are ordering this item so that you will be able to put your ID, CC & cash in the belt pockets instead of having to carry your purse/handbag to an event then unfortunately this item will be useless to you. The manufacturer needs to slightly increase the pocket dimensions to accommodate an ID & CC! What is the point of placing pockets on this belt if the pockets have no real functional use!"
3,Yvonne de Carlo,Strictly for Yvonne de Carlo-Fans. It's a B-Pictures with a likeable cast.I used to like it better when I used to go to the movies. We both have grown a little bit older. Stangely Yvonne de Carlo hasn't. At least in this movie.
3,PREDICTABLE,"GOOD CAST PREDICTABLE STORY. I`m not much on westerns, so I soon grew weary of this one. Good quality picture and sound."
3,value mug tree,"it comes with sandpaper so you can sand it smooth (which needs to be done). make sure you have paint on hand too as it comes unfinished. the base of mine is slightly bowed as it rocks back and forth. (very little - i attached felt pads on the bottom 4 corners which solved it) felt pads not included. it's a cheap mug tree, you get what you pay for."
5,Excellent!,"After replacing my radiator (which required removing the bumper), a bunch of my original clips broke. These fit perfectly and replaced the broken ones. These are a must-have for anyone who works on their car, even occasionally. They break easily if you aren't careful, but now I have a box of leftovers if I ever need them."
5,Greatest Questions,This book is straight Bible and non-denominational. It makes a great basis for Sunday school lessons and sermons from teenage level on up.
3,"Deep, constructive teaching on salvation","John Murray does a great job showing the different aspects of salvation and how God works in each part of those aspects in our life. This is a book that takes you to the basics and does a good job of showing scriptural reference. Its simple, to the point and a good book for someone that is trying to teach any aspect on salvation."
4,Redemption,This book seems to be in the condition I expected so generally I am really very happy with my purchase.
3,redemption accomplished and applies,Many of the insights shared by the author were new to me. They required me to review anew the scriptural references and in the end I believe that my conclusions are more in line with a biblical perspective.
1,Murray is soft,"Murray's work could have been good had his personal prejudicedopinions been kept out of this book. Professor Murray was a'Free Offer', 'Well Meant Offer' man and it shows in this book. Why, on page 56, and following, he even states that Jesus diedfor Reprobates! He died for them, but his death for them wasonly short of salvation. That's how so-called 'Common Grace'is accounted for by Murray. He has put it in the Atonement.My Bible says that Jesus laid down his life for the sheep. BewareMurray!"
1,Product,"After fooling with this stapler i found out how well it really does work, an i might add it does do a very good job, an the battery pack has some power behind it as well, for a hobbyist this is what you wanna get... had a bad impression at first but it turned out to be the stapler i like.. possible women could have trouble pulling the trigger but it may loosen up after a couple boxes of staples has gone through it... again folks i do like this product.. i used the 1/2 inch stainless steel staples they recommend.."
2,"More durable than plastic, but not easy to use","Bought this paper towel rack because I had a plastic under the counter one that snapped off when I tried to put a new roll in.This one is more durable, but it's kind of difficult to get one sheet off. The whole roll starts unravelling when you try to use it."
5,Bottlefly rocks!,"This scale of one to five stars is inadequate! I give this album 500 stars! I bought the CD (and had it signed by Mark, the lead singer) at their San Francisco concert last month, and the only time that it's left my CD player was to be put in my discman so I could bring it with me to school. Not only is the music fabulous, by the guys are great(not me mention hot)! If you haven't bought this CD yet, what's taking you so long? You're missing out!"
1,liars...,"this band/disc is awful trite garbage. it's got as much soul as any lame pop album, and anyone writing a glowing review like the ones i see here works with the band and/or their label in some way."
5,Gleaming the Cube,"This movie was very hard to find but once I found it on here and order it (VHS) no DVD's were available, it came in a timely manner with good quality. I am very pleased."
4,"""You promise me, no more war.""","Christian Slater in a skater flick... what, you're not sold yet. How about the fact that he can save the day with all of his no good Skater friends, including a young Tony Hawk. That's right, young Skater Punks, evil doers, and a pizza delivery truck. I think I've said enough."
3,"Bad movie, great skating","Everyone who likes this movie likes it for the skating or has/had a crush on Christian Slater. It's possible to fit in both categories, too, of course.Gleaming the Cube has a weak plot that fails to engage and the quality of the acting varies widely from actor to actor and from scene to scene. The clunky direction doesn't do much to improve things, although there is some amazing editing work.Christian Slater was new to being a ""star"" at the time of filming; for Slater fans, this is definitely worth watching to measure his growth as an actor.For skateboarding fans, there's no point in bothering to follow the plot--just sit back and watch some super hot skating and you'll enjoy it. Tony Hawk's skating in this movie is legendary for good reason but all the skaters turn in excellent performances."
3,i like the film,"I like 'Gleeming the Cube' and the skatebording. my tio, he says skateborders in film can ride good. i think the star does the good acting to. this film remind me of when i growing up in LA and see boyz skatebording in the barios with hevy metal music on 'boom box' to. my familia like film to. Recomend to you this film."
3,Scratched DVD,The DVD froze at the end of the movie. We noticed that there was a weird swirl pattern on the DVD which probably caused the problem.
2,Purchase Movie,"I bought a movie from this vendor. I was dissapointed to say the least. I paid $25 dollars for what looked almost like a bootleg copy of the movie. I only say that bootleg because when I went to put it in my DVD player it couldn't read the format. I had to watch it from my computer because that was the only thing that could read that format. The quality of the DVD was fine, but its really sad when you pay $25 dollars for a DVD that you couldn't get to play on your DVD player."
3,A HUNDRED BUCKS !,"Hey, it's a great movie for the times (80s), but a hundred bucks for the DVD!?...don't forget actress Min Luong in those erstwhile credits (also Big Trouble in Little China '86)"
5,RAD,the movie RAD is the best movie ever!!! I love it!!! I can't wait for it to be released on DVD!!!
1,It didnt work,"This movie did not work in my dvd player, it never stated region 2 and i have a region 1 dvd player,"
4,"If you like Christian Slater, you'll like this movie","A must for all Christian Slater lovers!! This movie reminds me of growing up amidst skaters and the like in California. At times a laugh and a half, this really is a good movie and I definitely recommend it."
5,My bros is introduced 2 Powell Peralta,"...N-E-wayz this movie is nice, I enjoy everything about this flik. The acting, the cast, and the script pretty much. But overall seeing the oldskool skaters Thrash the streets.Last time I seen that kinda suprize was when Tony Hawk plays the stunt double 4 USA'z favorite smarty pants ""David Spade"" in the hilarious film Police Academy 4 Citizens on Patrol.(87) Well thanx 4 lendin an ear and I enjoy this Website....so until then Peace & Safe Journey"
5,Extreme,I've seen this movie so many times I could probably repeat it word for word. It's full of intense action and the stunts are extreme. Story of a young skater who seeks revenge for his adopted brothers murder. Gleaming the Cube is a definite must see.
2,"I thought 'pegaditas' just meant hits, not medleys...","O.K., my Spanish-speaking friends, don't laugh! In case anyone else comes to this beautiful music with a first language other than Spanish, be forewarned that 'pegadita' may mean just a hit song, but 'pegaditas' may mean 'a bunch of hit songs all chopped up practically in the middle of a word.' Now I have to go back over my discography printout and try to find these songs that I thought were safely added to my collection. My error, but if by admitting my stupidity I can spare someone else the disappointment, no me importa si me llaman tonta! Anyway, thou shalt not chop up Los Acosta songs! Each is a complete work of art and should be left intact."
2,boring and confusing,"This book was a real snooze. The time travel element was not realistic. I've read better by JoAnn Ferguson, but I don't think I'll be reading anything else again."
4,VERY ENTERTAINING,Tough to Kill is an entertaining movie with a good story. The Ventura Version above is out of print but you can get a better version of it on MAXIMUM ACTION an 8 movie collection from BCI.
2,It just isn't the same,"To me the classic Skynyrd album of all time is One More for the Road (especially the extended version). On this one, Johnny sounds too redneck and the older songs are given too much of the power chord/38 Special sounding treatment. On One More for the Road there were 3 distinct ""clean"" sounding gtr sounds and the great Ronnie VZ voice. This record sounds like a pretty good Skynyrd tribute/cover band. I still enjoy them in concert where the differences are not as pronounced over a loud PA system. With only 3 original members left, I also find it a little hard to take them too seriously."
4,Not a Reject in the Batch,"What a breathe of fresh air!...I can get esoteric and drone on about how uplifting this collection of tunes is - let's face it: Sometimes life really sucks but your tunes shouldn't...this collection is just what the doctor ordered if you're cleaning up from a hurricane, fire, snowstorm, whatever...no whining just a focused energy to Move Along with what you're doing...are you driving? - turn it up and play along...save the dancing for the stop light...just don't try and read the lyrics: CAUTION CLICHES : the lyrics are shown on the scribbled paper format...hey guys have a word with your art director...unless you got palmed off to an intern...in which case a meeting with Interscope is in order...nice job..."
3,not bad,"This cd is pretty good. Most of the songs you can listen to over and over and they never get old. I had to only give this album 3 stars because I did not like the last three songs, they seemed like filler.1. Dirty Little Secret: Great first track. Kinda punk. Love it. 10/102. Stab My Back: Great guitar. The lyrics are a little simple though. 8/103. Move Along: overplayed but still a good song. I love the verses. 8/104. It Ends Tonight: Good rock ballad but I don't like it as a single. 7/105. Change Your Mind: Catchy. 7/106. Night Drive: My favorite on the album! Even better in concert. 10/107. 11:11PM: Nice chorus. Takes a while to catch on. 7/108. Dance Inside: Okay, but not one of my favorites. 6/109. Top of the World: It has a nice beat to it. Just okay though. 7/10I usually skip the last three songs..."
4,Better with each listen...!,"First of all, you absolutely must see this band live. Tyson Ritter is the real deal, an electric performer and truly unique. Between his stage presence, killer vocals and bass playing you have, simply put, a bonified 22 year old rock star. Nick Wheeler is the perfect foil to Tyson, a calm and confident guitar, smiling through power rips with the heartfelt lip curl as he digs down deep into marshall sonic bliss. The rest of the band rocks tight with these two at the focus. A fifth player on keys and guitar rounds out the live show. Any chance you get - duh, Go...See them once and U will want to see them again. The new record, like the first, grows on you relentlessly with each listen...it's not 100%, but for me, 3/4 kicks - once again AAR delivers their power pop formula - incredibly melodic, riddled with hooks, tyson's unmistakeable voice and phrasing - crunching down heavy and absolutely dripping sweet..addictive as heck...One more thing, play this record LOUD !!"
3,Déjà vu,"AAR have a great sound, very catchy hooks, and some nice vocals.That being said, I was plagued by a feeling of deja vu when listening to this album. The sound is great, don't get me wrong- it's just not original. There's nothing new here, and nothing I really want to spend my money on. Same old teenage hysteria- and I say this as a teenager- same old desperate attempts to make a mark on a world that will forget us in a minute or two.Move along; there's not much to see here."
2,"Oh, shut up","People who hype and rave generic crap like this probably also think nickelback's ""all the right reasons"" is a genuine work of art. Unlike other pop and rock bands like fall out boy, yellowcard and new found glory, TAAR have NOTHING to distinguish themselves from the million and 1 other adult alternative artists flooding top 40. Atleast when BSB and N*sync were popular, people knew who they were listening to. I couldn't tell this band apart from countless others if i tried. Tired, boring generic riffs, coldplay-esque piano songs every other track, an almost bored sounding lead singer, and meaningless, mundane lyrics. Yep, they're gunna be big alright. If i could bottle all the energy this record doesn't have, i'd have enough to run from here to chicago and back in one day.Download: Dirty little secret and Stab my back. The rest is just filler.Typical top 40 stuff. Safe and boring."
1,why are people listening to this weak crap?,just because your a kid it doesnt mean you have to listen to fake pop crap like if you want to listen to some real punk listen something like the dam-ed or the sex pistols and let this crap die out already and so something worthwhile can come along
1,JUST ANOTHER EMO CHARGED POP BAND!,"CAN'T REALLY GO OFF ON THESE GUYS, BECAUSE THEY DON'T EVEN TRY AND MASK THE FACT THAT THEY ARE HERE FOR NOTHING OTHER THAN MAKING MONEY OFF OF KIDDIES THAT HAVE YET TO DISCOVER QUALITY MUSIC. OTHER THAN THAT JUST THE USUAL BLAND AND BORING RADIO CRAP!"
1,you may relate to this crap but real punk rockers dont!,"i dont know why that guy has the nerve to say that everyone cant relate to this girly band, if you can then i dont see how your a real punk rocker because they relate to stuff like the sex pistols and the dead boys and the damed and other bands that really have something to say and not just want to complain about geting picked on in school and how their girlfriends broke up with them (can you blame them they are a bunch of crybabies) like the other reviews say if you want to listen to this crap atleast dont call it punk because all your doing is making the best class of music look as girly as a little pink dress"
3,too much of the same,"This album has some catchy tunes for sure. But the problem is that most of the songs start to meld and sound the same. I understand that each group strives to attain a particular unique sound. But there's nothing new under the sun, everything is just being reinvented. The title track ""Move Along"" has been so over-played on the radio that anyone would be ready to tune it out after the 200th time it seems you're hearing it. ""It Ends Tonight"" just comes across as whining and not a great song. After listening to this album, I can't say any particular track especially stands out. To me that would not seem to be a good thing. I think AAR needs to diversify their sound a bit. The lyrics aren't terrible, but nothing spectacular either. I would say this album is just ok. Overall score: 6.7 out of 10."
3,Move along... good title for a lame cd!,"Ya I got this whole CD for the song ""move along"". and thats about the only good song. The rest is kinda boring. But thats just my opinion..."
3,Hi,I dont know anything about the AAR!All I know is that I love 2 of their songs;Dirty Little SecretMove AlongIm obssessed w/ those songs!Their really good!:-)
2,i hate possers like this!!!!!!! by geek with ramen,"i first heard move along on jumpstart while i was on trips,and i though 'wowee!!!!!!this song rocks!!!' and i bought the album.i liked it for a while,but the songs are like the writings in a hollister-sporting preps journal!!!geez,i cant even stand the CD anymore,move along loses it's touch after a few listens...im not trying to flame,no im against flaming,i bought the album,listened to it a few times,and heres my opinion-AAR give sporty little preps reasons to do the rock on finger deal,and bob their heads to what they think is rock,while the rest of us real hardcores sit watching,a look of disgust on our faces.the guitars are nothing extrodinary,just your run of the mill pop-rockers with an axe,and the ability to string their chords together.no offense to you AAR fans,i dont want people to excpirience my dissapointment...."
3,Nothing stands out,"As someone who really enjoyed their debut cd, I have to say that this one disappointed me. It's not that the songs are bad, it's just that none of them are very good. There are no songs that stand out as one of those songs that will be running through your head constantly for days on end. I haven't heard any songs from this cd on the radio yet, and I have no idea which one they will choose, because none of them are really catchy. The first two or three songs would be decent supporting songs on an album with a few other hits, but they can't carry this cd by themselves. As I said, like so many unremarkable cds, it's not that they did anything particularly wrong, they just didn't do anything right, and there's nothing here to make you keep listening over and over."
2,a sad rebiew,"I USED to like this band till i saw them on TV at the MTV music awards. He was drunk and making a fool out of himself when he was accepting the award for their album. I was saddened to see him act so dumb, i could tell the rest of the band was embarrassed for themselves and him. I guess he's living up to the bands name, but not this kid! I'll stick with Fallout Boy instead yo."
1,Generic to the trend,"The All American Rejects, another disiple of the new milleniums chosen style of muscic: trash. I'm going to start by saying that the AAR sounds just like every other light-rock prep band out there. This band is incredibly unoriginal. In my eyes, just sold out to the world for their 15 minutes, which won't last 5.The band has only 2 styles of writing there ""music"":1. Slow, and sad - A poor attempt to try to fuse the feelings of the lyrics in with the music.2. Relatively Fast along with the generic style of singing prep rock. - needs no definition, if u listen to the radio, you know what im talking about.If you're wondering if you should buy this cd, i have the answer. No, I would much rather buy a broken copy of ""why kant Tori reed well?"". Overall, giving this cd 1 star is a miracle. I would never reccomend this to even the biggest fans of the AAR, hell, not even the band themselves."
1,Well...,"Don't get me wrong, I really didn't mind their first album. I like listening to many different genres of music, and I'm not usually very picky. When I first heard All-American-Regects were coming out with another album, my first response was, ""Hm, cool."" A friend of mine had me listen to their single (I'm sure you all know it) ""Dirty Little Secret"". I just couldn't stop laughing! That's not necessarily a good thing either. I just couldn't believe how ridiculously annoying they had become. Maybe it's just been too long since I listened to their other album and ""Move Along"" really isn't all that annoying in comparison. Or maybe this album is just as poorly done as I think it is. I really do hope this album will ""Move Along""...permanently."
5,WOW--GREAT,"Okay, I had my doubts about buying this CD because I'd only heard a few of their songs and I don't like to waste my money on trash. Anyway, I went with my gut and purchased the CD and I don't regret it one bit! It's amazing. Simply put and to the point--just amazing! There is no bad song on this CD. You'll learn to love every single song. I love Move Along but songs like Can't Take It and 11:11 are awesome! Anyone who loves alternative music will appreciate the artistic greatness of this group."
5,It's My Favorite CD!!!,"I love this CD. My Favorite CD!! Heres my views1. Dirty Little Secret: I liked it at first but gets old real fast.2. Stab my Back: I like the music but the lyrics are kinda freaky.3. Move Along: I LOVE THIS SONG!! This never gets old, never!4. It Ends Tonight: Another one of my personal favorites great lyrics.5. Change Your Mind: When I first heard this song on a Wal-Mart Commercial I thought what a happy song when I got the CD I thought What a great song.6.Night Drive: I don't really care for this song good drum rythm.7.11:11pm: I heard this was a bad song so I stayed away from it.8.Dance Inside: This song is tied with Move Along Excellent song.9.Top of The World: Another great song Love The Music Video.10.StraitJacket Feeling: A decent song good rythm.11.I'm Waiting: I never heard of the song until I wrote this review.12. I Can'T Take It: The Rejects Did a great job with a violn!"
2,Not as good as their first CD,"I loved the All-American Reject's first CD. But this one just doesn't measure up. Apart from dirty little secret there are no stand out tracks. Its fun pop-punk but it just won't stick the way Green Day and Fall Out Boy music does.On a completely different note I was kind of let down with the cover art too. Their first CD had no pictures of the band but this one looks like the album art of the next Backstreet Boys. Nothing against pop music but the All-American Rejects were my ""too cool to be cheezy"" band. I miss them.Anyway..I would recommend downloading Dirty Little secret."
4,Great Album,"This was an all-around great album. I would highly reccommend it because of its diverse styles(none of the tracks are very much alike.) From the violin-like backround of ""I can't take it"" to the punkish guitar of ""Dirty Little Secret"" there is definitely something for everyone on this album."
3,My thoughts on the Actual band and how they can get better,the all american rejects would be a much better band if they had a bassist.....instead of the lead singer also playing bass.......hes gotta make easy bass riffs so he can play and sing at the same time......if the bass riffs were more complex it would allow the full potential of the two guitarists....instead they usually just play rhythm guitar....usually the same chords......kinda waste of talent imo but i dont know how good the guitarists are at playing their instrument....i see potential in these guys...i really do but Ritter needs to drop the bass. they need to get a bassist to play for them (im not sure if they do that for concerts?)
4,This is actually good,This is actually good. I didn't realize it would be. A lot of suprise songs I didn't know they sing.
3,where did the old sound go?,"i will always love aar, but the sound on this album just isn't the same as their first. it's just a little too mainstream sounding."
1,More Faceless Crying,"To keep it short, this band follows the classic mold of assembly-line artist manufacturing. Whining, talent-deprived vocals; beyond-simple guitar; and other such tasteless implements of modern music. The industry force-feeds this nonsense, and ignorant children seem to eat it right up, without a single thought of the absence of musicality found therein."
1,All American Rejects... LITERALLY!?!?!?!,"This is without a doubt, the worst band of the past two years. Look at all their whining songs they've released trying to be all romantic but you know they've never gotten any in their entire lives... until the stupid groupies flooded them because they think the ""deep"" lyrics of this lame band are actually genuine. ""Dirty little secret"", twice as bad as their single last year, with that cute little chorus ""swing swing from the tangles of my heart!""... are you kidding me? This CD and band is a joke don't be a fool and fall into the grouping of people that are seduced by the ratings people have given this joke of a band."
1,Gay CD,This CD is gay.It is pure gayness.Every song is lame and pointless. Nigt Drive is the worst song ever.
1,Unhappy,"I ordered the game for my daughter on 11/28/06 quite confident that her wish list items were bought and I could forget about it. I never recieved it and was never informed by Amazon that it was returned as undeliverable. So on Christmas day when she opened her presents, she asked where it was. I told her I ordered it and we started looking about the house as to where it was. After going on the computer to the website I then found out that it was returned and my credit card had been reimbursed. Shame on them. I will not use them again. I believe they got too big for their britches and the customers are the ones paying the price."
1,ALOT OF CRYING,"I WAS DISAPOINTED IN THIS ALBUM. ESPECIALLY FROM A GOOD BAND SUCH AS THIS. I REALLY ONLY FOUND TWO SONGS ON THE WHOLE CD THAT WERE WORTH PUTTING ON TO MY I-POD ""IT ENDS TONIGHT"" AND ""MOVE ALONG"". AS FOR THE OTHER SONGS I THOUGHT THEY WERE VERY ""CRY BABY"". THEY ALL SOUNDED PRETTY MUCH THE SAME AS FOR BEING MAD AT SOME GIRL FOR EITHER DUMPING THEM OR CHEATING ON THEM. SO I WAS DISSAPOINTED TO HEAR ALL THESE WHINNY SONGS."
1,for selfish little brats!,"I bought my kid this cd. I hope she grows up. She really likes this garbage and it's kind of sad. She's 13, and the MTV is impressionable There is no musical talent and I believe the lead singer is a woman?"
4,You Won't Be Disappointed!,"I bought this CD as an impulse buy (it was on sale somewhere for, like, $7), and I was very pleasantly surprised. Very, VERY catchy punk rock. (And something absent are the suicidal references you'll encounter in a lot of other punk rock.) You'll find yourself humming ""Dirty Little Secret"" all day, and ""Move Along"" just makes you want to get up and start jumping around. These guys also know how to work the slower songs, too; be sure to listen to ""Straitjacket Feeling"" a few times! Overall, it's a very positive album, and I highly recommend it."
4,Excellent Rock Album,"I am not usually a fan of this genre of rock, but boy am I a fan of this album! Every song has a catchy tune and even catchier (sometimes tongue-in-cheek) lyrics. This is one of those albums that you want to pop into your car, put the top down, and cruise along while singing along at the top of your voice. Exhilaratingly enjoyable music!"
3,Decent album.,"Move Along by All-American Rejects is a good cd but not as special as their debut. Songs I do like include: Straitjacket Feeling, It Ends Tonight, Dirty Little Secret, Night Drive, and the title-track. The lead singer's vocals always leave me indifferent, he sings good and bad all at the same time (I know it's strange). I recommend the first album instead."
3,Forgettable,"I was a huge fan of the All-American Rejects' first CD. It's still a favorite, it's a pop gem that combines electronic, catchy beats with emotional lyrics. I think AAR took a step down from their emo-pop-rock throne with this album.Don't get me wrong, there ARE good songs on this CD. My personal favorites are ""Stab My Back"" and ""It Ends Tonight"".The problem with this album is that it is just... boring and unoriginal. They are forgettable tunes, even after many listens, unlike AAR's first album.I think the full-band-approach does not work for the All-American Rejects. Even in their first album, ""Swing Swing"" (which sounds like a full band) is probably the weakest song on the whole cd. The synth-drums work much better for this band.It is a shame that this CD could have been great, but wasn't."
3,It's good and the band has a chance to do better.,"I have never really been turned on to todays modern punk (except Green Day), but their are artist who have been doing pretty good in making that happen. All American Rejects (AAR) can hold their own with opening guitar riffs but then go into rip-offs of Green Day's work. But aside from the modern punk way, they have very intelligent lyrics. The first time i heard ""Dirty Little Secret"" i couldn't help but, bang my head. The drum beats are cheap, and so is the bassline. The guitar needs a little tweaking. But overall ""Move Along"" is the second best Punk album released this year. (But i don't think anything, this year will beat the Killer's ""Hot fuss""). Although now while they have the success, they should create a good image and maybe add some creativity to their music. (I mean come on Green Day had to invent their sound somehow, so why can't AAR?)"
5,All American Rejects Amazing,Soooo good album. I heard Dirty Little Secret on Much Music and I decided to buy this album. Every song on this album is amazing. This is one of those cds where you dont have to skip tracks. You can play this album from #1 - #12 without skipping any songs and u will be very satisfied.
2,Catchy But Nothing Special,"The music of the All American Rejects ""Move Along"" is mind-numbingly catchy I'll admit. But the problem I have with the band is that their lyrics lack creativity and it seems to me that any Joe Schmoe could crank out lines such as ""Let me know that I've done wrong/When I've known this all along"" or ""Take me break me/every mile further there's a part of me that slips away/One day you'll see/Even if you got down on your knees you couldn't make me stay"" Honestly, what teenager isn't writing such poetry at there homes at any given moment in America? Nice music to listen to if you don't mind lyrics that lack originality and depth."
2,sound like everyone else,The firt album was one of my all time favorites. I was very disapointed by this one. Its seems that they lossed all orriginality. I guess the lyrics have grown up a bit but they arent as perfectly strung together and addictive. Their sound used to be differnt from other bands like them but now it sounds like every other band on the radio.
3,The first C-D is better,"I am 15 years old and I am big fan of the All-American Rejects and I think that the first C-D is a lot better than the second, Move Along. The first C-D, The All-American Rejects, i related to more, experiencing the normal heartbreaks that every young teenage girl goes through, the first C-D is the one that makes me feel better like they're going through the same thing as me. Move Along is more Pop than rock and most of the songs aren't as catchy as the first. Move Along, a good C-D, but I expect more from the All-American Rejects in their next C-D."
2,Very Dissappointing,"I have read all the Rebus books which for the most part are excellent and exciting. This story is overly long and lacking in suspense. I suspect Rankin's motivation for writing is to get on to the political bandwagon of exposing treatment of immigrants.Rebus' concern for immigrants and his interest in the immigrant activist don't really fit with his character of the past. Instead of the gritty, witty iconoclast we now get a much different charcter.It seems that as with so many successful writers of series that eventually they focus more on the money or their own political leanings, so the quality of their stories suffer greatly."
3,"3.5 stars - Not his best, but better than good.","Although the plot seems overly complex and the pace a bit slow, Rankin is a remarkable writer who paints a picture of the problems of open immigration and how those people can be abused. Rebus is a marvelous character and it's wonderful to see Siobhan coming into her own. While perhaps not his best, one can never go wrong with one of Rankin's books."
4,Staying alive!,"Good news that Rankin brought REBUS back from retirement (I read about the his new book). Rebus is one of the best finde siecle detectives, in this book he deals with immigration / assimilation problems: no apologies, no solutions to one of the most complex political issues that emerged during the 20th century. His spatial descriptions are incredible vivid and lucid. Besides being a good entertainement, Ian Rankin has lot to teach to anthorpologists, social workers and urban planners. As usual."
3,Not the best but Still Love Rebus,"Note to TV watchers: a completely different plot than the TV show of this name!Way too many characters and subplots for me to keep track of. And Rebus seems less of a tortured soul than in the other books. But I still love to be with him and Siobhan. And, of course, ridiculous that they changed the title.If you have only seen the John Hannah version of Rebus, I'd like to say that the book are, while still dark, far wittier."
2,The Worst Rebus is years,I love Rebus and Siobhan. Have for years. This book is so boring. I am 3/4 of the way through and have no interest in finishing. The subject of the racism is so old. The writing is so trite. I can predict the next sentences of the characters -- maybe I've read too many Rankin.I can't believe that this book is putting me to sleep. Ian Rankin in the past has been one of my favorite authors--just read a non-Rebus book--Witch Hunt-which I highly recommend.
4,Another great outing with John Rebus,"This book didn't go how I though it would. In usual Ian Rankin style, a case that seems very straightforward becomes an interconnected web of seemingly unrelated incidents and individuals that the characters must navigate some choppy waters. I love the interplay between Rebus and Siobahn since they're just fantastic characters. Human trafficking, revenge, and the not always delicate thinking involved with immigration cases make for a mine studded landscape. Great read and as always, I look forward to more from this author."
2,Maybe It's Just Me,"I found this book boring and flat. Bought it in hardback because I enjoy Rankin. Very disapointed. Was Rebus always a wisecracker? I don't recall that. I felt it struck a false note. As I said, maybe it's just me and dreary February."
5,Another Excellent Book From Ian Rankin - But Why ...?,"Ian Rankin is at the top of his game in this book.But why did the US Publisher insist on changing thetitle? It's almost an insult to the intelligence ofthe American reader that we're too stupid to workout what a ""close"" is.Many British terms are retained in the book - binfor trash can etc., so why this change that actuallyalters a real street name in Edinburgh - Maddening!!"
5,Ian Rankin: Fleshmarket Alley,Another great Rankin novel. Full of suspense. One of those books that you just can't put down.
5,Great Condition for a Used Book,"The book was used, but essentially it was as good as new. Totally exceeded my expectations. What more can I say?"
4,Very Good book,Very good too start with as new in the world of drilling.its also very good in detail if it is needed
4,Such a good read.,"Let me just start by saying that this book is the reason why I own an Irish Setter today. Anyway, continuing on, it's just one of those books that's good - it's full of adventure the nature descriptions are realistic and the characters aren't flat. I read this when I was probably seven, and it's one of those stories that's stuck with me for ages afterwards. Definitely recommend this."
5,Classic,"You cannot lose if you want to read a great young adult story on your own, or if you are looking to read to or purchase this for a child. A great classic."
3,good movie,"If you're 'into' the supernatural, you'll like this movie. They deal with spirits as entities and not as 'real people' holding conversations as they walk along (ie Ghost Whisperer, Medium). It has a lot of elements that are true if you know anything about the spiritual world and how to 'contact' the dead.LS"
2,Little to recommend,"I found the insights offered here to be of the most banal and pedestrian nature. If you wish a better grasp of this book, chapter by chapter, purchase the Penguin edition. Its introduction and footnotes will more than help you over the admittedly tough hurdles this text has to offer."
2,WATER SPORTS?,"WARM WATER UNDER A RED BRIDGE (Home Vision Entertainment) is a comic fable about an unemployed architect who seeks treasure in a house near a red bridge. In the house, he encounters a woman with a most peculiar condition: she releases torrents of water when she has an orgasm. And much depends on this wellspring. The relationship becomes essential and explosive. Shobei Imamura's mature tale is seductive and confounding. In Japanese with English subtitles."
2,Mediocre at best.,"I got this speakerphone to use with an older laptop I have which doesn't have a microphone. It looked cool, had mixed reviews and it was cheap so I figured I would give it a go.What did I think of it? Lets just say I used it once and never again. Sure it looks cool, and technically it works but the sound quality was terrible. I tried it out on a couple of different laptops, one of which has a build in microphone, I set up a Skype call and it was terrible... I couldn't hear them well, they couldn't hear me well, I unplugged this thing and just used the stuff built in and the other person could have been in the same room.Maybe I got a bad one, maybe it might work better connected to different hardware or using different software but ultimately I can not recommend this product for anything but it's looks."
5,Marvelous Set of Schubert Piano Music,"Kudos to EMI for finally having released these fine performances on CD. I owed the Seraphim boxed set of LP's of these works years ago and was impressed by Bordoni's panache, technique and the atmospheric recorded sound. The budget price is an extra added bonus, but I would have paid full price for these fantastic performances of these brilliant miniatures by Schubert. Highly recommended."
5,A jewel!,"What a charming music this is! We become addicted to it very quickly. Before I discovered that CD, I had no idea Schubert had composed those waltzes. I am so glad I did. This is a real enchantement. Paolo Bordoni gives an outstanding performance here. Pure magic!"
4,OVERLOOKED,"I have always been a fan of the Fixx. They have recorded a significant amount of great music over the years which has barely been noticed. Elemental is a solid album which features what could be the best song the Fixx has ever recorded ""Two Different Views"". For this song alone the album is a worthwhile purchase. If this song had been a single back in the early 1980's when the Fixx enjoyed their greatest commercial success it would have been huge."
3,A let down after hearing the music previously on tour.,"I traveled 3 hours to see the Fixx on their "" Happy Landings "" tour , where they debuted this music . The set sounded incredible then , but after touring , and releasing the ' Tour Only ' EP "" Happy Landings "" , they decided to alter the material into a largely ' Unplugged ' type format. "" Ocean Blue "" went from frenetic to mortuary in pace , though it is the highlight of the CD. "" Two Different Views "" was stripped of much of Rupert's fantastic keyboards . "" We Once Held Hands "" is of good quality , but hacked down into a 4 - 5 minute track from its EP form . "" Happy Landings "" stands out as high - quality , but someone forgot to tell The Fixx and their producer that the whole Unplugged thing died about 5 years ago . Its hard to forgive them for leaving out "" Freeman "" and "" Lonely as the Lightower "" from their live set . You could do better with an old copy of "" Calm Animals "" or "" Ink "" ."
1,Adult contemporary. The Fixx?,"I can not believe this is The Fixx. I lost track of them at Ink and was pleased to see there are a couple of newer albums I had not known of; the Fixx are one of my favorites for such a long time, but this??? This album has few Fixx qualities other than Cy Curnin's voice. Why does this album sound so boring and bad and just plain cliche in all it attempts, I do not know why. I believe one reason I can not stomach this album is the missing Dan K. Brown on bass. His influence on The Fixx funk is larger than the little credit he gets, he kept them on a serious groove for so long, now their sound is closer to American Idol-styled bastardization than anything else.Oh well, I still love the Fixx, but this made-for-adult contemporary poop is not worth it."
3,Worth A Listen,"I bought this when it came out around a year or so ago. I don't have a high opinion of every song, but there are some good ones on here. The songs that shine out from the rest are ""Two Different Views,"" ""Happy Landings,"" and ""Ocean Blue."" You can't get any better than those, they're great. The rest of the album is okay. ""Is That It?"" is too silly for me, no offense, just not my taste. Overall a worthy album."
4,Mike still has that great voice and distinctive sound.,"It's been a while since I last saw Mike Tramp in concert(when his was with White Lion)but he has managed to keep that distinctive sound I became adicted to in '85. ""Have You Ever"" brought me back. Thanks for showing up with CAPRICORN."
3,A fairly good one for your Rock collection,"Mike Tramp's voice has changed a little bit since his last ""Mane attraction"" with White Lion. This CD has many melodic songs with touching lyrics (Have You Ever is one of them). However, it is quite boring if you listen all the songs of this CD at once because all the songs are lack of heavier guitar riffs of White Lion. They sounds more like Soul Asylum."
3,The singer from White Lion has grown up,"After fronting the hair metal act White Lion and the much harder rocking Freak Of Nature, singer Mike Tramp decided to go solo. His debut called ""Capricorn"" was released in 1998 and the music is far from heavy metal. Some would call this a more mature approach and Mike Tramp is performing a set of songs with an adult touch. The material is not hard or fast but have a over all kind of melancholy to it, often combined with a more melodic and captivating chorus. Mike Tramp is not writing so called ""happy songs"" and the lyrics often focus on depression, sadness, lost, confusion, exclusion, and abuse. But I would say that ""Capricorn"" is a good album (even tho its slight tendency of melting together into one long song) and certainly worth checking out either you're a fan of White Lion, Bon Jovi, Joey Tempest, Tom Cochrane or Jimmy Barnes."
4,Great effort by the ex-feline,"Mike Tramp was part of one of the great glam rock bands of the 80's, White lion.With Capricorn, he shows that he has matured into a great songwriter.Great melodies and a no-frills approach work well in keeping you hooked from the first to the last note.The only downside is that the album sounds a little under-produced.Maybe Tramp should have let a seasoned veteran like Bob Rock or Mutt Lang handle the console but trust me it will not keep you from enjoying this otherwise fine album."
2,It's ok,Nothing to rant and rave about. I like Dr. Koops medical books better. I don't think this one was worth the money.
4,Not bad...,"I was working at a video game store a couple years ago when I first heard this CD. It was in the random playlist of 5,000 songs that we went through in a day.Carrying lots of Japanese imports, this was one of the CDs. I also had the luxury of hearing the orginal soundtrack with out lyrics. Which is undoubtedly better.But this CD offers a change up to that with decent lyrics, most of it is pretty catchy and after loaning the CD to a friend for a year I was actually pretty excited to get it back.If you're looking at this CD, you probably wont be disappointed listening to it."
5,Great litter - too expensive,"Yes, it's way more expensive than it should be. Yes, it tracks some (but no worse than others and less than a lot others). But, boy, does it clump. All cat output (liquid or solid) turns to rock. So it stays way cleaner than any other I've used because scooping the litter doesn't leave behind little bits that fall back into the box when it crumbles. It doesn't crumble. And there is zero smell. It absorbs all of it. OK, I'd like to use the natural litters, like the one made with wheat (what a disaster with smell and crumbling and mess!!), pine (does nothing but give the cat a place to go since it doesn't absorb liquid or odor), the mechanical litter boxes that does the scooping for you, etc etc. I've had cats all my life as far back as I can remember, and have used every kind of litter that's made. This is the best so far.But can you reduce the cost? Or, at least, put it on subscription?"
5,Never going back.,"I live in a small home in a very humid climate. This cat litter is magic. I have never used a product that masked the scent so well. It is more expensive but I end up changing the entire box of litter less frequently so it actually evens out. I am spending the same amount on litter but I do not have to live with the smell in my small home. It doesn't track too much either, which is also a plus. I am never, ever going back to any other brand. This is worth every penny."
5,EverClean,"This is the very best litter in the market. I have used it for 15 years or so and occasionally have tried others. The others just don't clump as well and even with daily scooping, have an odor. EverClean never has an odor. It is excellent."
5,Ever Clean Litter pruchased from Amazon.,"This is the best kitty litter ever. I've been buying it for years for my cats but, every once in a while, I have tried a less expensive product in hopes of finding something that will work as well at a lower cost. Nothing else has ever come close, though. Ever Clean is just the best. The next time I see the unscented Ever Clean with free shipping, I will certainly purchase it from Amazon again."
5,Amazing litter,"I must keep my Persian Kitten's Litter Box in my small bedroom.I've had cats before where odorous litter boxes were a present and disgusting problem. EVER CLEAN UNSCENTED CLUMPING LITTER is completely odor-free without the scented chemicals I abhor and with a nifty litter box(no not the pricey automatic cleaning litter box ), my apartment has no catsmell, so even though the litter is pricier, I'd pay double for it.Thanksfor the technology. Awesome!"
5,Best. Litter. Ever.,"Tidy Cats wasn't doing it anymore with the addition of the second cat. I couldn't smell a thing from the litter box. I'm not a scoop every day person. I scoop when I smell the box, which was usually about 2 or 3 days before. With this stuff, well. I'm almost embarrassed to say how long I went without scooping. I don't have a scoop schedule, so... when I started smelling it 10 or 14 days later I just went ahead and replaced all the litter. So I'm not saying you should forget to scoop for two weeks like I did, but if you go by the ""when I can smell it"" system, you might need to come up with a schedule!I haven't had an issue with tracking, but I have a litter box with a little staircase in it to catch litter. The stuff clumps really really hard. The cats don't mind it and I'm glad to not have to smell things any more!"
3,"Works good, tracks around the house","This cat liter works great, clumps up well, holds the stink well, but it sticks to the bottom of my cats feet bad. Every time I pick him up this stuff is stuck to the bottom of his feet, now there is cat litter spread around the house.Not the worst tracking I have seen, but it will probably prevent me from buying it again as I dont like finding cat litter on my couch and bed, I am sure the cat dislikes it even more."
3,definition of unscented litter,"Am I misunderstanding what ""unscented"" means in reference to cat litter? I thought that b/c I was ordering unscented litter that there would be no baking soda in it. However, I received a box of litter containing baking soda. The litter worked very, very well. The problem is that I had purchased a special ""cat attractant"" to attract my cat to the litter box, and my ""cat attractant"" herbs can't be used in litter that has baking soda in it. Maybe, I was just accidentally sent the wrong litter? Definitely a high quality product, but I won't order it again, since it doesn't suit my particular needs."
1,Not Odorless Dustball,"I read the reviews....really???? The ""unscented"" litter is not unscented. Frankly, I don't need my cat's butt to smell like a flower, which is why I buy unscented litter. Also, stand a few feet back when you pour it in the pan - the huge dust cloud could choke you. Never again will I buy this litter."
4,Great Basic Learning Tool,"Very good content. It definitely still gives a good basic understanding of working with dynamic Dreamweaver. Easy to read, doesn't get bogged down in the technical rambling some books like this do. All of the online tutorials that go with the book are still found (4/2008) online at Sam's Publishing site. Worth a look."
4,"Better game, but less soul.","If Tomb Raider is Indiana Jones, then Tomb Raider 2 is James Bond. Alot of TR fans don't like this game, mainly because it has too much shootem'up elements to it than it should. I agree. But that dosn't make it bad. Infact TR2 is the most playable game of all the TR's. It dosn't have those irritating dark scenes too much. Lara actions are better. And the puzzles are better thought out. I'm also a fan of Far Eastern art. So the last levels realy felt good to explore. I'm giving this 4 stars because alot of the levels, although great to play, don't have the original soul of Tomb Raider. I would rather explore an Incan Ruin than Venice, or, Atlantis than an Oil Rig. You get my point. But I still like playing it and I have never tired of it."
5,excellent,"fun, scary, exciting and amazing are just four of the words that i can use to describe this game. the sexiest gaming character of all time, Lara Croft, returns in the sequal to the original Tomb Raider. i love this game so much, and all of the ones that follow. the levels are puzzles full of assassins that are trying to kill you on your route to winning the game. excellent fun, and can be enjoyed for all ages."
4,a lot better than tomb raider 1,lara's home is really cool with diving board and assualtcoarse.but why does the butler follow you in to the bath room
5,This book is outstanding,"A book of this sort was long overdue. Perhaps I am not familiar enough with works in this area, but it was refreshing to see a well researched, serious account of the early Italian American experience. As a second generation Sicilian, I can testify that the anecdotes regarding family traditions, etc are authentic. In addition, the book lends tremendous insight into the connection between current Italo-American customs and beliefs and their genesis and roots back in Sicily. This book is also a monument to the many and varied contributions that Italian -Americans have made to this country. It should serve as a wake-up call to all Italian-Americans that we have let assimilation rob us of our unique identity as Italians and as Americans. This book is a ""must read"" for all Italian-Americans and anyone who thinks (from thier exposure to shamefully biased and opportunistic gangster films) that they have even the vaguest notion of what it means to be an Italian American."
3,Review of La Storia,"I thought the book was generally good. However, I thought the authors were more defensive about Ialians than they should have been. I do not think the book can be used as ""history"" because it is not objective enough. There are also errors in the book. For example Joe Montana played football for the San Fransisco 49ers, not the Giants. Giants are baseball. They left out Willie Mosconi, perhaps one of the best billiards players in the world. For a book, in my opinion, to be used effectively as history, it has to be objective and dispassionate. This is very unfortunate because the authors had a wonderful opportunity to really ""lay it out there"" and let the facts speak for themselves. Nonetheless, I have sent this book to at least five friends and family because it is good reading socially and not for professional academic use."
3,+1/2 -- Trip-hopping Squirrel Nut Zipper,"Eschewing the hot-jazz of her former combo, Squirrel Nut Zippers, vocalist Katharine Whalen brings her quirky singing style to an equally quirky modern context. Unlike her 1999 Jazz Squad outing, Whalen's hooked up with writer and multi-instrumentalist David Sale for a funky, trip-hop excursion into sounds that bounce like an amped-up version of Portishead's ""Dummy."" The production compellingly syncopates instrumental lines, multilayered background voices and danceable tempos beneath Whalen's vocals. There's an undercurrent of exotica that rises to the fore on the percussive ""The Garden"" and brass-lined ""Want You Back."" Whalen's voice still has the Billie Holiday edge of her SQN releases, but the impact is completely different in this most surprising and inventive context. 3-1/2 stars, if allowed fractional ratings. [2006 hyperbolium dot com]"
5,Drink some Cherry Kava Kava.,"I thought the last review was good but he tried to give it 3 1/2 stars so it rounded down to 3 which isn't right for this very cool disc. So I'll give it a five to correct his theory of glass half empty. Although every time I see five stars on Amazon, I always think girlfriends and moms. Hmm who gets 5 stars. But as the previous reviewer noted, this is a big departure, which for me is a good thing. Quite refreshing. And I always cry at the end of ""follow"". A lot of good songs and beats. And I love the Cherry Kava Kava Song. I heard this cd on Kcrw and bought it and am very pleased!"
2,A Long Wait For A Big Dissapointment,"From the moment I heard Katherine Whalen sing ""Low Down Man"" I knew a real jazz talent had come upon us. The only working female singers to be her equal are Norah Jones, Stacey Kent, Diane Krall, and more recently, Anjani. She hadn't released a CD since 1999's Katherine Whalen's Jazz Squad. I waited patiently for Dirty Little Secret. What a let down. A profound disappointment. The warm voice is gone. The mixing is terrible. The background music is loudly out of proportion to her voice. It blares on relentlessly, almost as if she isn't there. Why did such a fine artist put her trust in this producer? Hopefully, she'll find a mentor who will take her back to where she belongs: the smoky, sultry, small group format------and choose vocal material worthy of her talent."
5,great matress,Matress arrived before confirmation lettet from sleep center in good shape. Product meets all expections and is very comfortable to sleep on. Pillow is a sorry excuse made of floor sweepings. Cover provided fits and is useful.
2,Not as good as Wall O Waters,"I accidentally bought these at my local garden store and was very disappointed. I actually find them more difficult to fill up then the separated-chamber protectors (like wall o waters), and they don't stand up as well as them either."
2,A few problems,"After on using for about 45 days, 4 of the 9 I purchased began to seperate at the bottom. They did not leak, but they didn't stand up well and 1 in particular needed added support. They are covered under a 1 year warranty so I am going through the process of getting some replacements. The others worked very well and this is an impressive invention."
5,excellant!,HIGHLY RECOMMEND - IF NOT FAMILIAR W/ZYDECO OR BUCKWHEAT ZYDECO IN PARTICULAR - THIS IS A WONDERFUL INTRODUCTION! IF YOU'RE NOT NEW BUT WOULD LIKE TO COMPLETE OR ADD TO COLLECTION - THIS ALBUM WILL DEFINETLY COMPLIMENT! WILL DEFINETLY ROUNDOUT ANY COLLECTORS NEEDS FOR ZYDECO!I DARE YOU TO SIT STILL LISTENING TO THIS MUSIC!
4,Kentucky Cajun,"The music appeals to everyone type of music fan, blues, gospel, rock or pop fan. It combines all the elements...great sound."
3,Not great,"This book starts out very easy, not much challenge. Later the puzzles become more like topical vocabulary lists such as items in a kitchen, or articles of clothing. I found these rather boring. Also, not much overlap of rows and columns, so clues are not plentiful. Either one knows the word or doesn't. I wouldn't buy again."
2,like it,some times the author needs to maybe leave a little bit to your imagation .the book is not bad though may read more of her books
2,Same story line,"Just beginning chapter 4 and it's on it's way to being deleted on my Kindle. Same type of story line as so many others, that it's really boring. Sorry...."
3,Fell Flat,"I love this author but could not get into this book. For me, it was predictable, and I did not connect with the characters."
3,disappointed,"I've loved the Blossom Street series by Debbie Macomber, So I thought I'd try Montana. There is too much violence in this book."
4,Satisfied,I am very satisfied with the way that my purchase was conducted. It was delivered within a reasonable amount of time and it was what it was advertised to be.Thank youLisa Rzepecki
4,Not worthy of being a hardcover,"This is the story of a single mother and her two sons and the move home to Montana that they make. There she meets the foreman of her grandfather's ranch and sparks fly. Neither Molly or Sam wants to admit that they are attracted to each other, but the grandfather can tell. He offers Sam land and cattle to stay and marry Molly because once Gramps dies Molly will not be able to work the land on her own. Gramps dies and Molly and Sam realize that they do love each other although there are many hurdles to overcome-the loan payment, the children ,their pasts and the mysterious accidents. I found this book to be cliched-I knew how the money situation would be resloved. I also knew who the ""secret"" bad guy was. I did enjoy the style of writing as everyone's thought were given. This book is a typical romance. No better and no worse."
4,Well Written but Predictable,"This is up to Debbie Macomber's usual standards, but is somewhat predictable. Enjoyed the story very much, but it held no big surprises."
3,Montana,I felt the story was very predictable and not up to Macomber's usual stuff. It did not keep my interest like her stories normally do.
2,Wow,Riveting tail with great twists and two incredible endings. Recommend this as a great read by a warm fire on a cold night
3,Too much going on,"Where to begin? As far as this story goes, there are more irons in the fire than in a blacksmith shop in hell. At times, it becomes hard to even keep pace. However, in the end, all becomes clear. Most of the villains in this book I have never heard of and many seem to go down way too easy. Catman and Deadshot are both cool and Black Adam maintains his villainous arrogance. I think to get the full effect of this story you would need to be a true lifelong DC aficionado. Good artwork and layout but with a storyline this confusing, I'll rest at 3.5 stars"
2,"Decent, but missable.","Villains United is a fairly well drawn mildly entertaining trade paperback, though far from memorable. You don't need to read Villains United before reading Infinite Crisis."
2,Not as advertised,"Instead of Nutone Bags, #391, as advertised on Amazon.com, I received Envirocare Technologies bags, ""designed to fit"" Nutone central vacs.I do not care for such deceptive marketing.I haven't had to use the bags yet but if they do not stand up I will return them."
4,Good Vacuum bags,This order saved me from going store-to-store to find the bags for my built-in vacuum. They came on time and were perfect for my system. Good price too.
4,Overlooked Gem,"Yeah, yeah, yeah Baker Street was awesome. But this album, although it probably bombed financially was a solid piece of music and writing.The opening title track is simple, but smooth. ""The Girl Has No Confidence"" is a fast paced work that reveals a sad part of Rafferty, in that despite all the good things going for this woman, he notices the weakness. Rafferty fans are probably used to his bleak, often morose view of life, the music industry, and at times women, so it's nothing suprising. ""Right or Wrong"" continues with that them, but it's a serious good rocker with a guitar as strong as in his ""Take The Money And Run"" from the Night Owl album back in the 70's. ""Clear Day"" is a good attempt from Rafferty to look at the world optimistically, although it's a fairly simple tune. Overall, the well-produced album plays well. If you're a Gerry Rafferty fan, then it's worth $20-30 from a dealer. If you're just learning about him, then I'd suggest the classis album City to City."
1,Returned,"Looked like it said it had a ""T"" style connector. Did not work with my black & decker PW1600 electric power washer. I returned this item."
3,Not What I expected,"When I read the reviews for this book I was looking for information and guidance to begin my journey of self-acceptace. Instead I found this book to deal more with the authors coming out and his relationships with both patients and therapists. While the author had some good thoughts, the book did nothing to help me in my struggle to accept this part of me."
5,Coming out? Coming to terms? This is a great book,"Are you or someone close to you struggling with coming out? This is an excellent book to start this uplifting journey. Coming out is all about self-acceptance. To me, reading Isay's wise council from this and his Being Homosexual was a real godsend. Once you dispose of the garbage that society and internalized homophobia has put in your way, the road to inner peace and tranquility is pretty bright and shining. Explore. Live. You'll love this book and the happiness waiting for you in a full and abundant life. You can't go wrong with this one."
5,Love ite!,My MIL started my daughter with this collection when she was born. The dolls are pricey but well worth it. The prices are A LOT better here on Amazon.
3,showing some middle of the series lag,"In this book, it appears to me, everyone is getting somewhere else but not much else is happening... It gives a lot of explanation (though their gods are really active! lots of Dues ex machina going on, especially for Alain!)The prediction grows clearer, but ever so slowly. I am looking forward to the next book but this just felt like it was a bridge from book 3 to book 5, giving essential information but certainly not as engrossing as the other books have been.Also, I bought this used, through Amazon, and one warning I will give is check where the seller is, and how geographically far away they are. I usually get books in 3-5 days, but this took almost 3 weeks, and that might also be why some of my excitement flagged."
5,A Review of Child of Flame,"This is by far the best of Ms. Elliott's present series. There have been so many characters and subplots so far that it's been hard to really make an emotional attachment to any one, even Liath. However this book finally starts drawing things together in a cohesive manner. I think that one of Ms. Elliott's main problems is that she gets too caught up in her own subplots and loses her grasp on the main story, which seems to me to be what happened with her Jaran series. Although Jaran was a masterpiece, in my opinion, the other books lacked focus and sprawled out of control. But Child of Flame, as far reaching as it is, actually gains focus. I almost didn't read the book as I was disappointed with the others; I'm glad I did."
5,Amazon great for hard to find songs.,Played great and contained hard to find songs. Exactly what I wanted.Good value. Amazon is the first place I look for the hard to find songs.
3,Do you like arrogant jerks?,"Do you like arrogant jerks? Then do I ever have the book for you! Alan Lomax describes his every encounter with the people he claims to respect with a mix of condescension and pity. Although it contains some valuable information, I found Lomax's racist undertones and patronizing attitude too distracting to feel the book was worthwhile."
5,Brillant recording,"The second I put on this cd I knew what I was going to get , but even so I was suprised how sexy and catchy the songs are . ""King's Horsemen"" makes you feel like you are sitting there singing with them when it was recorded . cat black wizards hat ,brings about the sexiness of Desire(come and get it) . In all , it is a must have plain and simple."
2,mediocre overall.,"The opening title track is a great dance tune , but the rest of this disc just does not cut it. It seems rather uninspired. As music to simply dance to , I would say this is adecuate. Yet overall as a recording this falls short. These girls have some great artistic ability- There are some rather ""sensous"" moments, and they throw in a good share of slower tunes for a good mix, but they can't seem to get out of the rut of mediocrity. The tune ""tutur"" is an example of the potential they posses. I'd say if you like Thalia w/ touch of disco this may be up your alley , but if your standards are high, be careful with this one."
3,"Nice placemats, but poor shipping.","These are beautiful. However, they did not come in a hard plastic container as other reviewers have said and they had all of the stickers and care instructions removed. Some of residue from the stickers was still left on the mats which was a pain to get off. I'm not sure why they did this."
4,lenox placemats,"These are great placemats. Can be casual or semi formal. Beautiful, classic design, elegant in its simplicity. They make a wonderful place setting for any occasion. I highly recommend them."
3,Wasn't all that,"I am stand-up comedy fan, but after watching this DVD it didn't really leave an effect on me to say that it is a must see!I would not advice nobody not to buy it, but buy it knowing that it isn't all that funny as the hype in the beginning of the DVD with the superstars saying how funny the dvd is!"

5,Greatest mystery story writer- two thumbs up!,"When you pick up this book, you just can't put it down! A cliffhanger yet funny!"
1,Don't bother.,"This product is everything it claims to be--except waterproof. I purchased one to use at our local waterpark, just to keep few bills, an ID and maybe a credit card on me. They fit perfectly. I was in the water for maybe 10 minutes and when I pulled it out of my pocket, it was half-full of water.Giving the product the benefit of the doubt, I tested it in a controlled environment, thinking maybe I hadn't closed the seal properly the first time. I submerged it in a few inches of still water, for 30 seconds, with a single credit card in it. It filled with water. Even when empty, the seal leaks like a sieve.You're better off with a Ziploc baggie."
1,not at all waterproof,This wallet was not even slightly waterproof. I took it on a cruise and the second it went in the water it filled with water. Basically it was worthless.
5,The Seer and the Sword,"This book was a delight to read. From the minute I picked it up I was hooked and couldn't put it down until I was finished. One of its unique strengths is the strong, heroic female protagonist who would inspire any teen-ager and thrill any parent who has been searching for this particular needle in a haystack. I invited author Victoria Hanley to appear as a guest on my radio talk show and she was as skilled with the spoken word as she is with the written. This book is a must-read for anyone who loves books containing rich fantasy & imagination!"
2,Enjoyable enough...,"This book is a quick, enjoyable read, but I honestly don't see what everyone else sees in it. First of all, the characters aren't real - the bad guy is evil, the end. It's very predictable, and the writing isn't that great. Also, the political ""intrigue"" in it is just fake. The kings are all pretty much idiots; they do things that would simply not be done. Obvious bits of the story are spelled out to us for some reason or another.The only good thing I can see is that the _idea_ for the story was nice. The author, however, couldn't carry it through well enough. If you can get past the unreality of it, sure, read this. But I don't recommend it; it's not something that will stick in your mind after you set the book down, and it's not something that will leave you wanting more."
3,Better than I expected but worse than I hoped...,"This book is what I call and ""Okay"" book. So If any of you fans are mad that ""Okay"". I just think that this book is not the best. It's a fine book to read and I suggest that you read it but it DOES have it's low points. So please read this book. I'm just giving my personal opinion, not a fact at all.Torina is a princess and when her father comes home from yet another victory he brings her a gift. When he killed the king of Ballandra he brought the Kings son, Landen. He gives him to Torina as a slave but...she sets him free.Meanwhile the king has brought a great sword from the city. A magical sword with powers more great than imaginable. The sword belongs to Landen and he wants it back. As Landen trains with the other boys he needs to know what he's going to do.Hopefully you'll try this book and like it more than I did."
2,Not that great...,"I really expected more from this book. It's fairly pleasant, and the premise of the plot is interesting, but the writing is just not that captivating. The way the plot unfolds is really contrived, too."
5,Great Novel!,I randomly chose this book for a book report way back in the 8th grade and it quickly became one of my favorites. I'm very excited to finally be adding it to my collection!
1,Disappointing.,"I so wanted to love this book because it's exactly my kind of story, but the execution is a major fail. The whole story is extremely predictable, and I have to say that I disliked every single character in it, especially the hero and heroine. Such a boring pair!"
4,Easy read and entertaining book,"I really enjoyed this book. I found it easy to read and understand. I was able read it in a day but still really enojoyed the characters. The plots were good and it moved along. I recommend this for readers who enjoyed the Prydain Chronicles by Lloyd Alexander, The Water Trilogy by Kara Dalkey, The Dragon Chronicles by Susan Fletcher, and other stories that involve the kingdom good vs evil line with that King Arthur touch."
5,The Seer and the Sword: More like a movie than a book!,"With quick ""scene changes"" within the chapters, The Seer and the Sword reads like a film script rather than a novel. This trait adds much imagination to this book.I, with a forgetful mind, do not usually like novels with a lot of characters to remember the names of. Yet, in The Seer, it added a bit more enjoyment.You could call it a fantasy, but that would be an understatement. With different kingdoms, magic, and huge wars being fought all over the land combines the elements of a fantasy so sweetly it needs a cherry on top.Anybody who neglects to read this book is missing the chance of a lifetime, a bright color in the mind's eye of books."
3,Buck Knife,"It is a bit smaller than I thought it would be, but it fits nicely onto my key chain. The color is not as vibrant as it is on here, but I am not so concerned with the color aspect. I just thought it was worth a mention in case it did matter to someone else. The blade is sharp and the safety lock works well. Having multiple keys and things on my key chain, this knife blends in well."
4,Definitely Buck quality!,"I sometimes balk at buying Buck knives that are made out of the country. However, every time I have bought one I have not been disappointed. This is a great little knife for the price. It is really cool looking. The picture does not do it justice. The blade is super sharp and big enough to do just about everything I would need it for. I mostly use it for opening boxes and plastic packaging and it does both just fine. It's a little bit big to carry on a keychain in my opinion. I try to keep my keychain size to a minimum so I can put it in my pocket. However it is the perfect size for any pocket. I would say this is a great everyday carry knife for my needs. I own several bigger Buck knives as well and use them if I need something a little bigger. I deducted one star because the opening mechanism doesn't quite feel as comfortable as my other Buck knives. However, I have NEVER been disappointed by a Buck knife, whether made in USA or not."
3,Great knife - horrible color,"Knife is a great size, exactly what I was expecting, except the color. I got the translucent blue color and it looks purple. It is strange, because if you put it next to purple it looks kind of blue, but still nothing close to what was pictured. If I would have known about the color I would have gotten the black one."
4,Made In China,"Very nice little keyring knife. Bought a red one, slick design and not too big. Was a bit disappointed Buck Knife would stick me with a product that was made in China. If I would have known that, I would have Not bought it. Over-all very happy with it. However, Buck Knife gets the ""raised eyebrow"" on all it's products from me from now on."
4,good product,"It's a buck knife so it is made really well. I prefer my first model better because you can just flip the blade out with your thumb. This one I have to use both hands to flip the blade out which is not as convenient, but I suppose safer...other than that, no complaints!"
4,After Forsythe Saga- Over the River,"Reading Galsworthy can find one alternately saying to oneself -it's a soap opera; oh that's why he won the Nobel Prize. He wrote 3 trilogys with Forsythe Saga by far the best. But those who like and want to venture into another 900 pages of his other two here's my advice.Over the River is a stand alone and in the 3rd trilogy titled End of the Chapter and his last work in 1930. My advice- skip the other two stories - Maid in Waiting, Flowering Wilderness and read Over the River. In the UK Depression, midst a divorce of Claire and reawaking of her sister Dinny, Galsworthy has all his skills and story telling on display. You will never get to the third book if you start with them in order as the first 2 seem dated, unfinished and yes too soapy."
3,Well....,"I bought these shoes in a double wide. When I put them on they were tight. Because I loved the design and really wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt, I wore them for almost an hour. Then I couldn't take it anymore. My toes actually went numb. These shoes are definitely not a double wide. The bottoms of the shoes are also slippery and not a rubber bottom. On the plus side, the insole was extremely comfortable. The eggcrate design was fantastic."
4,Great R&B from a Usually Jazzy Man,"I love me some Will Downing...okay! Some think Luther is the king of the makeover song, but they have not heard or appreciated Will's interpretation of a song and making it his own. For example, ""I Try,"" ""Wishing on a Star,"" ""Girl Blue,"" ""You Sure Love to Ball"" and a country song, ""I go Crazy."" The man is tough! This cd is much more r and b inspired and based on the reviews of other consumers I bought the cd and was glad I did. I bought it at Will's concert in the bay area jazz club Kimball's East and let me tell you, if you haven't seen Will live, you are missing a great performer. You will not regret purchasing this cd, however my fave from Will is A Dream Fulfilled!"
1,NOT THE WILL I KNOW,THIS CD WAS A BIT TO HIP/HOP FOR ME. DID NOT PUT ME IN THAT MELLOW MOOD THAT ONLY WILL CAN DO.
3,"IT'S NOT RIGHT, BUT IT'S OKAY","THIS CD IS MORE R&B THAN HIS PREVIOUS CD'S, WILL STRAYED AWAY FROM THE JAZZY SOUND THAT WE ARE USED TO.THIS IS ON THE LEVEL OF GERALD LEVERT. I DON'T LIKE THE FAST BEATS, THEY ARE SO TIRED SOUNDING. WILL COULD HAVE DONE A LOT BETTER. THE CD IS OKAY, WILL IS MY FAVORITE SINGER OF ALL TIME. HIS NEW SOUND MAY BE AS A RESULT OF HIM SWITCHING NEW RECORD LABELS, HE IS NOW WITH MOTOWN RECORDS. WILL, PLEASE BRING BACK THE JAZZ."
1,WARNING! NOT LIKE HIS OTHER CDS!,"what was will downing thinkin!cds #'s 3-7 was all nicely done well with r&b and jazz! thats what he is best at! the first two cds were will's way to find hisself in the music business! cd # 8 only has two tracks that remind you what will downing was suppose to be about! what is with all these new hard fast beats! this is what we try to get away from! great great standout examples would be cds#6 and#7! i think will downing better get crackin on cd# 9 REAL FAST! NEVER! NEVER! NEVER! change from what your fans are use to you doing so so well will downing! go back to jazz fused with r&B! thats what sets you apart from the rest! however, sayin all this, you are still my favorite male artist period! tracks 4 and 5 on this album proves that you still can do what your fans like the most!"
2,Half the Man...,"Years ago I was in a Record Exchange store and someone was returning a Will Downing Album... I purchased it, and I've been in love with him since that moment I placed the needle onto the wax. I have gone to every concert he's had in Cleveland, OH, I have purchased every CD, compilation, or guest appearance CD he's been involved with, even when he sang ""House Music"". I've even had the honor to meet Will in person (He is a wonderful person) So naturally when this CD came out I order it before it's release date, received it in the mail, rushed in the house to listen to it, and was highly disapointed... It's Half the Man Will use to be. I miss the heart warming music he has become know for. I patiently await his next project."
1,Downing Falls Short On Latest Project,"Switching to a new record company, Downing not only changes labels but also decides to change his sound. Abandoning the smooth jazz adult contemporary sound that made him famous, in favor of a trendier, hip hop urban sound...the results are very disappointing. Downing's rich voice simply sounds out of place on these selections, which are much better suited for someone of lesser depth, like R. Kelly or Sisque. Unfortunately, Downing has lost a lot of radio airplay with his new sound. It's too Urban to play on Jazz or Quiet Storm formats and Urban/Hip Hop stations have refused to embrace it. Hopefully, the singer will take note of this disaster and revert back to the formula that has worked for him over the past 12 years."
2,Disappointing.,"After recording such wonderful, jazz ballad-oriented albums like ""Moods"" and ""A Dream Fulfilled"", I found this CD disappointing as it is hip-hop and new jack swing-based. A great and gifted singer like Will needs better material and production."
1,Buyer Beware,The information on this item is pathetic! One would assume it is a reprint of the 1895 vocal score to Victor Herbert's first performed operetta. It is not. It's a reprint of the libretto for the operetta. A vocal score I can use. This reprint is useless.
3,Super Reader,"This Highlander novel is perhaps a little more complicated, with multiple immortals. A museum caretaker, Methos, MacLeod, and an exhibition of Immortal gear. MacLeod had a sword for him, from one of the K-guys he dealt with in the past.Both MacLeod and the museum guy, Constantine had encountered a Hebrew immortal named Mordecai in the past, and now he was back in the present."
2,"This isn't ""Highlander""---it's Middle East Zealotry-Light!","Ms. Lettow manages to submerge the protagonist, Duncan MacLeod, in a once-over-lightly polemic on terrorism and the Middle East. In the process, any resemblance to the mythos of ""The Highlander"", and the epic fantasy, is irretrievably lost. She seems uncertain about the established character and persona of MacLeod and gives the reader the odd sense she doesn't even like the hero of the novel very much. This creates a strange feeling of disinterest in the reader for the events taking place. Although the author was a junior member of the series' writing team, she seems unable, on her own, to bring the flavor and character of the Immortal Highlander to life. We end up with a flat and unsatisfying historical propaganda piece that is ""Highlander"" in name only."
2,Too light for me.,I love time travel romances so I bought the book after reading the great reviews but I thought it had a slow and simple beginning which read like an Americana romance and not a time travel. I wasn't caught up in their story. Maybe there should have been more character development so I would have kept reading.
1,Selfish Jerk,Man is a selfish jerk who cheated on one of his wives while she was dying giving birth. Trash like that doesn't deserve to find love and live happily ever after.
3,Timeless Wish,The story held my interest but I was dissapointed that there weren't more references to the future. It always makes me laugh when the people can't figure out how to do things. It seemed that Laura already knew how to do everything and being 100 years in the past was no sweat. That wasn't real believable.
2,pond air pump,"This ran well for awhile, but then one of the two stones or air ports stopped working. THe other one ran for about a year and then got very weak. I disconnected them and put a general hydroponics air pump out there and it is much better. I wouldn't buy another aquascape pump."
3,"great idea for hands free phone calls,",I really like it and would like it better if the hard plastic ear bud actually fit in my ear without having to rearrange the configuration of my poor ear..
1,Designs are not the same,"The Raging Magnum pistol will not utilize this mount. This mount is for Raging Bull 8"" Barrel. I had to get it milled to mount on my gun"
4,Classic dog training,"This book is easy to read and contains a ton of great information about dog training. Be forewarned, that if you plan on using a training collar you should get a book that covers those basics as well since this book was written before that training tool became available.Lots of humor."
5,Excellent Condition,"Book stated used and in good condition, the book looked brand new!! My husband was very pleased with price. We received the book in a great timely manner! thanks!"
5,Gun Dog,As far as I'm concerned Wolters' Gun Dog and Water Dog are the bibles in retriever and bird dog training. I purchased Gun Dog to replace a 30 year old copy that would loaned out and never returned. The copy I purchased from Amazon was new and well suited to my needs.
5,Gun Dog,"Wolter's books always have, and most likely will always be, THE authority on hunting dog training. The book is easy to read and is no nonsense. It will help you to better understand your pup and bring more satisfaction with the training process."
3,whatdog,"It is very simplely understood for newer gun dog lover. Especially for some people whose mother-language is not English.But I have a very querious question, what breed is the dog on the cover"
3,Could be better,"I was a bit disappointed with this book. It does not give step by step instruction and leaves you feeling like there is something missing. There are better dog training books out there. The author has a few ""old"" ways of training and there are better methods."
1,A huge disapointment,"This was a waste of money, I bought Wolters Gun Dog afterwards and it made this video look even worse.If you are interested in this video let me know and I will send it to you for free."
4,Worked for me,I used this book for my first dog and had excellent results.I do not know why I got away from his methodes but now I am Back.Yes its time conuming and can really try ones patience but it producesa great dog.
1,a less than useful classic,"This book may appeal to the novice hunter/dog trainer lacking both experience and the facilities necessary to properly train a gun dog. Unfortunately, the prescribed training methods (like the old bird wing on the fishing pole trick) provide fun games to play with a puppy, but do NOT help to develop a working field dog. Buy a more modern book by Tarrant and/or others instead of this one."
1,Completely outdated...give your dog a break!,"If you have a copy of this book on your shelf, chuck it. This book is completely outdated. This book is mired in the training techniques of the '50's. Bill Tarrant wrote some memorable books on dog training, but a lot of his material was based upon Mike Gould's advancements in dog training. Check out ""The Labrador Shooting Dog"" by Mike Gould or Tarrant's classic, ""Hey, Pup, Fetch it Up!"""
5,Excellent addition to your Astrology library.,"When this book had just come out, I attended Ms. Brady's Fixed Star workshop in Atlanta, May,'98.The lecture given was enthral ling ...Ms. Brady's interest & expertise in her subject were very impressive. Naturally, I signed up to have a Fixed StarReport done by the lady herself, & it has added ""oodles"" of info to my own charts, etc. Soon I had the book in hand & have been very impressed with it also. Not a beginner's book,perhaps,unless you have an interest in myths/archetypes.SolarFire4 software has the lists, etc., but no written report...you need this book to ""read all about it"". Beginning/Middle/End of life info can be yours!Which stars are connected to your chart/planets? Find out.. & be amazed!!"
5,Brilliant,"This book sheds a new light on fixed stars. Bernadette Brady delineates the fixed stars according to their psychological influence. She teaches some very useful new methods, based on (recovered) ancient techniques. Her interpretations are practical and to the point. A must read."
4,The Best of Three Worlds,"Imagine the soul of Lauryn Hill, the angst of Alanis Morrisette, and the rock egde of Tina Turner all wrapped up in one explosive singer- well then you have the latest dynamite artist to hit the scene. Her name? Simply Kina. The Detroit-native's voice is a welcome addition to what has become a scene dominated by bubble gum pop and trailer trash rap. From the ripping ""Girl from the Gutter"" to the catchy love yourself ""Me"" to the heartful ""Have a Cry"", Kina should be a front runner for New Artist at next year's Grammys. Every song on this debut CD exemplifies Kina's wide range of song style and lyrical prowress. MTV did the right thing making her video for ""Girl from the Gutter"" buzzworthy (the first time I heard the song), because the buzz surrounding Kina has just started and should continue to build to well-deserved peak of popularity."
5,Kina-Live,"I just seen Kina open for Savage Garden in NY at Radio City on Tues, 7/25/00. I had no idea what I was in for. I thought her voice was incredible and her sound is just awesome. It's rare to see someone with such a soulful voice singing rock music. She did remind me a little of Tina Turner. I plan to buy the CD, I'm sure it's excellent. She sounded so great on stage!"
5,Kina Rocks!!!,This CD is a perfect blend of Rock & R&B. Music making at it's best. This Cd is worth it at twice the cost.
3,Edgy and idiosyncratic,"It's hard to find an atrist whose music simply defies categorization. k.d. lang is one such artist; George Michael is another. Meet Kina, one more in a long line of artists who insist on making their own marks.You've probably got the whole Alanis-meets-Tina idea by now, but Kina's music is more than that. There's a lot of emotion bubbling under. You can hear how excited she is to be able to express herself. It comes in every raw note of pure vindication in ""Girl From The Gutter,"" and every breath of the plaintive but powerful (but ununimaginatively named) ""I Love You.""The music is much more rock than most R&B, more R&B than most rock, and more folk than either. You'll find simple but pensive lyrics and a voice that alternately wails, whispers, coos and rasps.It's hard to describe this music, which is one more of those things that makes Kina Kina."
3,thisclose to 4 stars!,"if only she came before alanis.to be honest,she out alanis alanis.kina's lyrics are on a higher plain without having to be''ironic''.dont get me wrong,i love alanis.but her lyrics tend to be repetitive.usually the 1st 3 words in every sentence are the same.its refreshing to see an artist that goes against preconceived stereotype.i was passing by a listening station and saw her cd.as a gag,i bet myself this was another''soul diva''.how wrong i was!(gratefully so).well,im sure this wont get the props it deserve,but i hope she doesnt get discouraged and please not wait 5 years inbetween cds.i hope youre reading this SEAL!"
2,disappointed,"I listened to this cd after purchasing Jill Scott's ""Who Is Jill Scott"" and I realize that Kina has a very strong voice but she is not using it to say anything. I amdisappointed but very glad that Jill Scott is on the scene now."
3,Don't get this one,"There are two issues I had with this surge protector, aside from that it's ok. Firstly, I have a laptop to which I've added many USB peripherals. Because USB isn't the best, my USB audio system tends to make poping sounds every now and then. This problem is much more frequent on this surge protector than with a similar surge protector by SurgeArrest. More significantly, I found that On Demand doesn't work when using the cable protection (the audio frequently completely drops out for something like a second, and the video also occasionally breaks up). I'm convinced that other surge protectors are a bit better than this one."
2,Didn't work for us,"I bought this sling when my son was 8 months old and 19 pounds. He hated this carrier because he couldn't turn around and see the world. I hated this carrier because the rigid straps cut into my hips and shoulder every time he tried to move. The seller recommended making sure the straps were place correctly (I tried numerous positions. There isn't a place on your body where unforgiving straps are particularly comfortable) and also said to tighten the straps so the baby couldn't move around. I did all of these things and still found it very uncomfortable to wear. The seller was helpful and the product arrived promptly, so I gave it 2 stars instead of 1. There is a $5 return charge."
3,ellaroo baby carrier,"ok baby carrier but could never seem to get it comfortable on my shoulder. Always feels like its not right. baby seems comfortable but I prefer a carrier that is both comfortable for parent and child. If baby falls asleep its not very comfortable unlike other carriers that can ""convert"" to support a sleeping baby."
4,Mixed feelings about this bag,"Bought this to replace a Wenger laptop bag (one of the oversized ones). I grew tired of always having to carry it and the wheeled solution appealed to me. If you are looking for a versatile and well-made bag, consider this one.That said, a couple of ""wishes"": I wish it had more pockets (or better designed) to carry all the cords and accessories we all have to deal with for various electronics. I wish it had a fastener of some kind so you could secure it to a wheeled carry-on (piggyback style) for moving through the airport, etc. It sort of sits on top but there is nothing to secure it from falling off.Have not yet detached the bag from the wheeled base and frame, but it's nice to have that option. Very good value in my opinion and very smart-looking case."
2,Not for me.,"I researched a lot of cases and typically depend on other reviews before making my decision. This case seemed perfect for me. I really wanted the brown but the cost was much higher. I really liked the feature of the removable base. However my first impression was the smell of Chinese packaging. Upon further inspection I was unable to get the handle extended. After several tries I finally got the handle extended. The most impressive feature to me tuned out to be a dud. The removable base. This feature offers absolutely no practicality in real life. This feature is just to complicated. Unzip three or four zippers, I do not remember. However if you think you could easily put this back together on the way to the airport, think again. I ended up returning it and purchased a Delsey from Mori luggage. With the exception of the handle the leather and overall quality seemed OK thus the two stars."
3,Broken wheel,"I purchased this briefcase because of its very large carrying capacity, and that it can hold a 17"" laptop. It worked well for approximately four months when I noticed a wheel dragging a little. I looked down and noticed that the wheel had come apart. The wheel itself is disintegrating from use on concrete and blacktop surfaces. The other wheel looks worn, but has not disintegrated. Now I have to carry my heavy briefcase everywhere. I have used the leather Solo briefcase before, for six years, and no problems at all. The replacement detachable wheel set is $90.00. For twenty dollars more I can go back and purchase a new Solo! Overall the bag itself is good. If you're planning on using this bag at the air terminal, or other long excursions using the wheels, I would recommend another manufacturer."
3,Too Small,"The quality of this bag was really good .... nice leather and workmanship ..... but it was far too small for a wheeled bag. It looks much bigger on the site than it actually is. It is very narrow and would only carry minimal materials in addition to a laptop. I am going to return it in exchange for a much bigger, expandable bag."
4,rolling detachable computer case,Neat concept to have detachable rolling case. Works well. Has ample storage space. Would have given this a 5 star rating had there been a more feminine looking bag with all the same storage space. It is nice to have the option of a rolling laptop case for a woman.I would definitely recommend to a friend or buy again.
1,False advertising,"I purchased the item after review it;s specifications carefully. It clearly indicated it was a carry case for 17"" and under notebooks pc/macs. In addition, it indicted a detachable roller bracket. The Item shipped was made by McKlien and that is about all that matched the description. The item shipped to me did not have a roller attachment and was NOT meant for notebook pc's. It was an older style legal fold open for carrying printed materials. After making arraignments to return the item, I did so immediately. They received the return and then stalled the refund. After confirming they had received the through UPS. I then was force to get Amazon involved in getting my refund process. I will never buy from this company in the future and suggest you be very cautious if you choose to do business with them."
5,Invaluable Resource,"If you are a serious student of dog behavior and development, this text and it's companion are resources worth your investment."
2,Regurgitated information,"This series is definately an easier way to keep all the information from other books in an easy to reference format. It is not, however anything new. It is basically a reformatted compilation of information previously published. Still worth having for a book junkie like me, though it is very expensive and probably more up to date information is always avaible online.."
5,Have used this product for years.,Have used this product for years. Helps in many ways. This service was easy to order and I could get the quanity I need. Will order again!
4,Nice Product,"Bought as a gift for my daughter. Her apartment has very limited cabinet space, so this works out perfectly hung on a wall in her kitchen. Simple, yet very functional and seems to be very sturdy as well. Also purchased the hanging pot rack from Woodforms. The pot rack accomodates several pots & lids and is a great space saver."
5,"The classic, the best","Lots of exercises for the budding composer. Those who wish to write the great art music of the 21st century should try to get a copy. By the end of the book, all the classic rules of harmony are repealed, because one has learned when to break them, and when to follow."
2,This Text is only for Advanced Studies,I strongly believe that this book could easily create misunderstandings to a student of Harmony. i found this book almost chaotic when I studied it as a Harmony sudent. In comparison to Walter Piston's Harmony this book has not a straight and organised method of teaching and I only recommend it for advanced students.
5,I didn't know that...,"What a great approach to Bible study, although I read it for pure enjoyment. This book is definitely for the adult of average intelligence who attended Sunday school, but was really there for social reasons. We grow up thinking we know so much and then grown we realize there is so much more to learn. This book is limited on the number of Bible stories covered, but the approach is wonderful. I was sad to be finished with the book. I will be looking for more books from Sister Scott and recommending this to my sisters and friends."
5,freedom,"a great russian film, almost a musical, that shows a way of life rather than one story. gypsies are described amazingly well, the costumes are inspiring and the music is fantastic.it could be defined a russian 'HAIR'-a rare pearl of russian filmography"
5,Wish more people knew about it!,"Absolutely marvelous - cinematography, music, passion, life! It's always been one of my favorites - well, since I was - what - 10 or so:-).I wish more films of this outstanding quality were made nowadays - simplicity in all its beauty - well, real art! I guess these reviews are for you to decide whether to go ahead and get this Gypsy Saga - do not think twice - and - you are welcome, in advance:-). ENJOY IT!"
3,It is good but not excellent,"I am very pleased with this product, only comment is that I wish the material is a lot thicker than it is."
3,Good storage option,This is a nice set of storage containers. I rated this three stars because the quilting is not as padded as I would have liked for the price.
2,Broken,"Although the containers are great and work perfectly, one of them (the cup) holder was received with a broken sipper. Went online to see if I could just send that one back and get a replacement. But the site would only allow me to send the whole set back for a refund. Then I would have to order another set (if available). Too much hassle, we are just using it with the broken zipper. Just lay the flap over without zipping it. Ordered two sets, second set was fine, and is just what we wanted."
2,Very Disappointed,"I did not see a review on this book on Amazon, so I bought it used through one of the other Amazon retailers. I am so glad I did not spend much money on this book.I was very disappointed in this book. The book was almost entirely illustrations. The only pictures in this book were on the first page of each chapter and even that was a letdown. In chapter 3, there a photographs of three floor designs, one with a set-in square. Nowhere in the chapter did they tell you how to make that design, just generally info on laying out the design you want.I gave it 2 stars for the information, but feel it would have been a really good book with actual pictures of the steps. In these types of projects, pictures are much better than diagrams for me. For a great guide on laying tile that INCLUDES photos, I recommend Working with Tile by Tom and Lane Meehan. It is a Taunton's ""Build Like a Pro"" series."
5,Muy Bueno,Este libro me ayudo a comprender las relaciones entre las parejas tanto para matrimonios como para novios. Me dio buenos consejos sobre como lidiar con los problemas a los cuales se enfrentan practicamente todas las parejas. Se lo recomiendo a todo el mundo que le interese este tema.
5,Interested in transport theory?,"If you are interested in semi-classical charge and energy transport theory in semiconductors, Seeger is still the best book to learn from. For experimentalists, this book is a boon since many formulaes are given in ""reduced"" forms - just plug in material constants and get a numerical value."
3,surprisingly expensive for small paperback,Had no idea what this book looked like until I received it. No photo was provided. It was a small paperback that was too overpriced. Don't know how that happened since the book is worth only about $30 from the source. I returned it with no problem.
3,"Bits are wonderful, but still my least favorite of Erdrich's","Erdrich's novels are all about the same characters and setting, and people and stories overlap and intertwine. But this is the only novel that doesn't feel complete in and of itself. Parts of the book are simply wonderful--particularly, Lipsha's account of how he came to get a tatoo. Worth the price of admission for that story alone--but still, for an Erdrich fan, a bit of a disappointment."
1,Hats are in childrens sizes.,I had ordered a size large hat and it is obviously a childs size hat. You can get these same hats at target for 10 - 15 dollars. If you want a hat that actualy fits an average adult I would go elsewhere.
4,Great collection,A great collection of original work by women science fiction authors. Here is encountered the expected stories focused on women as well as those told from a male point of view. Likewise not all the endings will please the reading but most are expected from the characters and situations. A good gift for women who like to read other women's work or for those just interested in new voices in science fiction.
4,"A bit of caution, Jack Higgins fans","When this originally came out on Showtime, I was thrilled, because I thought ""Eye of the Storm"" (the book this was supposed to be based on) was excellent. This wasn't the story the book told. Given that, however, when I watched it the second time around, I found myself enjoying it. I just put the book out of my mind and took this for what it was, an excellent movie with plenty of action."
4,Knight Review,I really enjoyed this movie made from Jack Higgins's book. I have read several of his books and have enjoyed all of them. It was interesting to see how the movie protrayed the characters from the books. The story line and action was good.
3,Offers increased mobility,Its a good product for those who need a refersher in re-training an strength building inn the water. the product frees up my arms and legs to get stronger in te water.
3,Ok,"My swim instructor would not allow me to use it, it also made me feel uncomfortable in the water, really did not need it for confidence."
1,"THIS is NO jackass, just another wannabe",THis dvd sucks. Save your money. YOU have very little topless or any nudity in this video.The guy trys to be funny like JOhnny kNoxville but only ends up making an ass of himselfin front of a bunch of girls. It appears as though everything is scripted as all girls inthis video are smiling and look all fake with their memorized lines.
5,Other songs...,"I first heard this single (Girl from the Gutter) on Realplayer Take 5. It caught my attention right away. I immediately began searching for other songs from her album. Be sure and listen to ""Have a Cry"" and ""Me"" before you judge her voice. This girl has some great tunes! ""Have a Cry"" has a soulful swing like Sheryl Crow's leaving Las Vegas. But it's more bluesy (is that a word?). And Kina really sings on that track! ""Me,"" I only heard the first 10 seconds of it. But it has a unique beat. I almost didn't think it was Kina until I heard her voice. Of those three songs that I heard, I'm definitely going to buy it. Some people have compared her to Alanis Morissette or Sheryl Crow. I think she holds a slight similarity. But she stands on her own with an original style. A nice blend of Rock/Pop and Blues."
5,Awesome for any use,"I got this item a few days ago, and it is totally awesome. This is the kind you can see sometimes at Holiday Inn or Best Western. Cheap, easy to use, and durable. You can fold it and store it virtually wherever you want, and it comes to you in assembled condition. Great for dormitory use as well."
1,Show is great but download bites,"Downloaded the show after I bought it, yup paid money for something... and all I get is broken sound and flashes of color. I however can play it on amazon.com or their player but that's not how I do things. I save things to watch over and over on VLC and this won't play and it won't convert and it sucks.I won't be buying online again. I expected to be able to save this to my external drive as I would any other video I bought at the store but sadly that is not the case. The only way to make this work is play it on amazon player or windows media player but not VLC which I use and prefer. I don't want multiple players or to have to remember which video played on which player. Just too much crap."
3,Poor Editing,"This is an interesting book however, my ebook addition has a number of errors in editing. The characters were mixed up a couple to time. There were a number of misspelled words and incorrect grammer."
3,The Elect,"Grammatical and spelling errors are like fingernails on a chalkboard to me. ""The Elect"" has more than it's share of them. It took quite a while before any kind of plot began to emerge too, bouncing back and forth between character and scenes. It even confused some of the characters in the two political campaigns, inserting them into the wrong scene. Overall, it was an okay book."
3,Doesn't come together,"The buildup was great, but just didn't tie together at the end. Plus it started to get very cheesy about halfway through. Pretty disappointing, but by no means a bad book. Perhaps a better author could have run with this concept a little better."
1,predictable and one dimensional,this book started off promising and then quickly turned into a dull and sloppy exercise in predictability. seemed like the author was more interested in sharing his political views than presenting an interesting or nuanced story. couldnt wait for it to end.
1,Good story but extremely sloppy formatting detracts from experience,"The story is a good read, but . . . I have never seen such a sloppy piece of work published in any format. And frankly the sloppy formatting detracts from the reading. It's distracting and frustrating. Amazon should do better -- the author's work deserves better"
2,"OK story, but reads like a rough draft","The story here was interesting enough; though I found nothing surprising in it, certainly no big surprise at the end.What I did find was a book that looked like a rough draft - clearly there was no time spent on cleaning up the author's writing before springing it on the public. If this book were to be proofed and cleaned up it would get a much higher rating.This author seems to have potential, but I really hope he either educates himself, or gets a good editor to clean up after him before unleashing another book. A book as sloppy as this does not warrant paying for it."
5,A political junkie's delight!!,"I was blown away reading this book. I expected this first-time author to put out the usual Republican dribble but thought I'd hold my nose and read it anyway..what the heck? It would be a diversion from my democratic points of view. What this book did was reveal the nasty side of Republican politics (is there any other side?!?), its extreme right-wing evangelical wingnuts and and the people who really control the party. I was able to identify characters who are real people out there today. The visuals created in my head by this author seemed as though I were watching a movie. Great character development, smoothly written, a fantastic read...for only $.99!!! You won't be disappointed whether you are a Republican or Democrat!"
1,Pulp Fiction,"I gave up on this book around 20%, way past when I really wanted to quit. I didn't care in the slightest about the cardboard characters. The plot was thin. The writing is tragically boring and uncreative. This is an example of pulp fiction at its worst. Finally removed it from my Kindle.On the positive side, a book about politics can easily become preachy, or appear that way, but I didn't have the feeling the author was going that way."
2,Plodding plot,"I really wanted to like this and tried to stick with it. However, it just didn't move fast enough, and was just too implausible to suit my taste. I gave up and was sorry I wasted my money."
2,Grammer punctuation speling disaster,"I must agree with the other critics. Ensure or Insure? and so on and so on. The storyline was lost while I waited for the next error. I finished it, but wish I had more will power to just hit delete."
5,Nice political thriller,"Fast paced and fun political thriller. Nice characters, some plot twists, a good conspiracy. I'm waiting for a second Gilbert novel."
2,Predictable and Poorly Formatted,"Decent enough story but the plot was very predictable. The poor formatting for the Kindle really took away from my enjoyment while reading this. There were multiple people speaking without line breaks, some lines with only 1 word, randomly interspersed numbers(page numbers maybe?) sometimes in the middle of a word. It was obvious that the author spent 0 time proofreading the Kindle version."
3,OODBMS,"A look at some real world cases where the implementation of Object-Oriented database design worked well and was successful. A bit outdated, sometimes not too relevant to today's mixed use of both types of DB. A good read nonetheless."
5,Add a copy to the Whitehouse book shelf,"Right next to the Quran.Lets see if they can ignore 100,000 copies arriving in the next 3 months,"
5,Great summary of true Islam,This book is a wonderful compilation of documents and writings of Muslim leaders throughout history. It covers a wide spectrum of how Muslims regard so-called infidels.
1,Garbage,"I so regret that I bought this book. I did it to check the arguments of a certain islam-critic who used this book a lot as a source in discussions. As expected, the book is quite selective. I'm guessing that a lot of islamic scholars are left out because they could muddy the picture that Bostom is trying to draw, but even the ones that are included are not given a fair treatment. Bostom has handpicked the quotes that best supports his argument. Academically this book is a sham, and is utterly, completely worthless."
5,The best book on Jihad,"This is a complete work on the history of islamic jihad and covers the conquests of many lands, including India, the middle east, africa, ect. It details the immense brutality that has always been present in islam and shows how islam has always spread: by jihad, in all it's brutality. Islam is surly the worst curse that has ever befallen mankind!!"
3,It's a Scary (Islamic) World,"I have no intention of reading this cover to cover, as this is quite a tome. The idea that ""jihad"" is simply a spiritual ""striving"" seemed like whitewash, and this confirms it. Plenty of energy has gone into diving in the medieval records, and other periods, through centuries of Islamic jurisprudence and commentary in fact. I cannot, however, countenance the reliance upon fanatical personalities like Khomeini and Qutb. There's a large burden of proof that these are representative of mainstream Islamic opinion, I think. Then again I have not done the work Bostom has. The final judgment needs to wait."
2,Good comfort but a slight problem....,"Okay, first things first. The shoes have excellent comfort on the bottoms of your feet when running. The bad news, because the tongue is so short the edges where the shoelaces lace into end up cutting into your ankles (literally). I wore these shoes and about 10 minutes into my run, my ankles where bleeding. Blood red does not go well with white. I have however rectified a solution to this. You will have to pull out the plastic that holds the shoelaces in(they are blue in color). They are not needed and only cause problems. For me I had only needed to remove the outer plastic, but that might change for someone who is not flatfooted. If you don't like cutting up your shoes, don't buy these."
3,"Not Neccissary for the ""Infinite Crisis"" story arc","This book was a little to busy and hard to follow. I'm not a fan of Adam Strange and only a fan of Hawkman and Hawkgirl because of their connection to the JLA. I bought this book because of its connection to ""Infinite Crisis"" but I think you could get by without it unless you are like me and just want to have the complete story line."
2,Not needed,"I bought this as well as all the other countdown to Infinite Crisis books, and I must say this one disappointed me the most. Other than the fact that it was revealed in IC #4 that (**** SPOILER *******) Superboy-Prime moved the planets with his bare hands, and that OA is no longer in the center of the universe, this book has no other relevance.The story really drags, to the point that you forget what the heck it is even about. This books is packed with beautiful art, but lackluster writing.If you want to have a complete library, go for it. If you think you are buying this to get a larger more fuller understanding of Infinite Crisis, you will be disappointed.PS. I also bought the Rann/Thanagar Infinite Crisis Special one-shot for $5, and I wish I had spent that money on some Archie comics, or given it to the needy, cause that book sure wasnt needed."
2,"a nonsensical story; decent art, i suppose","i love Hawkman. i love Adam Strange. i didn't think there was anyway this could be bad. but it's really not very good at all. the art is fine, not terrible as far as this sort of art goes. but ultimately, this book does neither character justice. nor the fans."
2,"Boring... and not really necessary for the ""Countdown Series""","Nice to read, but it has a lot of text explaining all the war background and it becomes boring. The storyline doesn't really add to the Crisis storyline either, so I recommend it only if you're a fan of Hawkman or Adam Strange (a TRUE fan)."
5,AWESOME!!!,Played it on my playstation when it first came out and loved it. The graphics are much better on the PC so I decided to play it once again. It's a very graphic game and definatly not for kids. Can't wait for Manhunt 2.
2,Boring and Frustrating,I played 8 levels and this game is a combination of all that sucks about computer gameplay....1. ALL STEALTH and NO PLAY is totally BORING. 2. Preset game save is total BS when you finish 1/2 of a tough level and lose to some stupid logistical nightmare of getting around a wall while being shot at and of course dying easy. 3. I like to watch real time game play when I attack someone..not a video outtake!! I tore it off my hard drive and plan to give this game to someone I hate.IT IS NO FUN....DONT BUY IT.
2,Splonter Ceel,"You take splinter cell, you take away the engaging story line, you take away complex level design, you take away character versatility, you take away advanced graphics, you take away objective variety, you got manhunt.Zip, zap, zoop."
3,Manhunt,"Overall a good game, got quite sick of sneaking around though and hiding in the shadows.The attacks got quite repeditive and boring and the game was just a bit pyscho for my liking.I am in New Zealand and this game is banned but I still managed to sneak it in through the post lol."
2,Poorly constructed -- expect it to break.,"I love this remote when it works. It synchs automatically and makes my life easier.But buyer beware. I know two others (besides myself) that have this device, and one can't use it anymore after he dropped it on the floor, and the other has had to piece his back together.Mine stopped working altogether."
2,KeySpan's support is a disaster,The TuneView works OK except the fact that you can't play all songs of a particular artist by just navigating to that artist. You always have to navigate down to the song level before you can start playing a song. At least that's how it works with my new iPOD Classic.KeySpan's support is particularly unhelpful. First they send you an answer which is definitely not correct and after inquiring further they don't respond anymore at all.....great!!!
2,Degrades audio quality,"I love this remote! It is brilliant and the range is amazing.However we have found that when the ipod audio passes through it, the sound is noticably degraded. One solution is to plug the audio in via the top ipod headset jack, but that seems kind of messy.We've tested vs the ipod headset jack, a monster cable and through the remote docking station. Its clear there is some kind of audio degrading via the docking station.I'm really disappointed because otherwise I love this remote."
2,Dead on arrival,"I was intrigued by having one of these since I thought it sounded like a good combination - the ability to control the ipod connected to my stereo from any room. The reality was disappointing since it never worked. I followed all the directions very carefully, and I even checked that the firmware was up to date and tried resetting it to factory defaults. Unfortunately it would not function. The iPod would play fine in the base, and the remote would power up but would never show anything from the iPod and only a few of the buttons functioned.It's impossible to give a fair review when the item is dead on arrival, but one thing I did notice - it puts out a wicked high-pitched whining noise when the remote is functioning. The documentation says that this is normal - but I consider it unacceptable in an audio item."
1,Doesn't work well with my TV,"I bought this to hook up to our main TV/stereo in our family room (Visio 46"" LCD). It works on the stereo but when we hook it up to the TV the screen flashes every few minutes. It doesn't do this on any other TV, only this one. But, since we only bought it for this particular TV, we will have to return the Tuneview."
4,Keyspan,"I just received this product and within 5 minutes, had it up and running. Simple to connect and yes, the buttons are a little fragile-feeling but for version 1.0, it works just fine. As for the wireless, it works all over my backyard and is a perfect pool accessory (not waterproof)!!! I wish all my remotes were 2.4Ghz... Great product!!"
1,Keyspan Support Unavailable,"I have purchased three of these for my business. The application is terrific, unfortunately, we're rough on the remote and the two purchased in March 2007 need repair. I spoke to Jose in customer service on Nov. 16th and was given a warranty repair number. He was extremely helpful and assured me my repairs would be done immediately. I returned two remotes, and they were received in-house by Keyspan on Nov. 21st. I have yet to hear from anyone regarding the status of my repairs. I have been unable to reach a live person. I have left messages on Jose's voice mail, the main voice mail, and I have emailed numerous times. I have not heard a thing!!! Now the phone just rings and rings. It doesn't bode well. Beware!!! As of today's date, 1/16/2008, I have still not heard a word from Keyspan regarding my two repairs. Nobody returns my calls!!!"
3,"Excellent signal, not rugged enough.","TuneView is one of the best remotes for signal coverage and not needing line of sight back to the dock. We're currently using this in a 5,000 sq ft. facility with full range and no signal loss from all locations.However, TuneView lacks ruggedness in its design. The keypad takes a little getting used to and *feels* like it may go bad after heavy use. I'll update this comment later on if this turns out to be the case.Also, the design for the batteries is extremely poor. The contact prongs protrude too far out causing them to bend and loosen after even short-term use. This might be fixed with wads of tin foil providing sufficient padding for the batteries.Since the TuneView is such a critical part of our business, we're actually going to get a second one for backup purposes."
4,"Love it, but remote makes weird noise","Menu on remote is best thing ever, but it does emit a high pitched ringing-in-your-ears sound when lit up. However, you can make your selection and then set the remote to ""sleep"" and the screen turns off and the ringing noise stops. Having a menu on the remote made this a no-brainer choice over all other iPod output devices and it works great, so I put up with the noise."
4,Great Accessory for Your IPod!,"This product delivers what it says it will do! Took only a minute to set up, and the remote syncs with your Ipod very quickly. Easy to navigate through the different menus. Only 2 things that bug me a little: Although the LCD screen is easy to read, the control buttons are not backlit, so they are hard to see out on the deck in the dark. Also, some of the lists (such as ""purchased"" songs, or playlists) are not in the correct order--just in a random order. I've found the best way is just put it on shuffle and let it go. Then its easy to move on to the next song if you don't like the one that comes on.Great remote and dock station for the money!! Lets you control the volume via RF as well. Its sort of like buying the afforable alternative to Sonos."
4,Searching Song List Takes Awhile,"I've had this item for about 4 months and compared to the previous remote, this is many times better. My only gripe is that I wish there was a quicker way to find a song or artist. Currently, you go to your song list and have three choices from which to search for your song. Beginning, middle and end of list. With 8,000 songs, it takes quite awhile to find your song unless it starts with the letters A, M, or Z.An improvement would be having the capability to atleast punching in the first letter of the song or artist to reduce the searching.As stated above, this is a fine product and as far as I know, the best product on the market. But as we all know, there is always room for improvement."
4,Damn funny stuff!!!,"It seems there has been a lot of bad reviews about this film. I think most of the reviewers here wanted a classic, instead got a lemon instead. I never heard of it, until I bought it for $3.00 at Big Lots on a whim. And it was worth it. This film is funny as hell and just as over the top. Sure, this film is B-movie level, but it is fun to watch. I have been watching horror films for 30 years, and I've seen many bad movies... and ""Botched"" is not that bad. Somewhat cheesy, but still worth a view and a few chuckles... Check it out, you won't regret it!"
2,worst Killer ever,"Well I gave this movie a chance because I am a big fan of guts and horror movies. As well as some comedy/horror films. This one had a chance until the ""crazed"" killer is shown. That character and performance is so awful, that it ruined the film for me. I know I am no professional reviewer, but that's just my personal opinion."
1,botched is just that....botched,Yes I'm going to be the square peg in the round hole.Stephen Dorf was tolerable but the rest...STINKO!Its bloody but stupid.How dare they put this in the same ball field as Shaun Of The Dead.At least Shaun was funny this....not!I like what the other writer said about being drunk to find this amuzing....You'll have 2 hangovers while engaging this rubbish.....MENTAL!
3,perfect name,"Ok I knew that this was a horror comedy goin in but I felt there was 2 much comedy. The movie was nice and bloody/gorry but the killers just weren't menacing enough 4 me. Let me give examples: lets say Nightmare or Elm Street 3 funny and scary Shaun of the Dead, Evil Dead 2 or even Cabin Fever managed to pull it of. With that said can see they were tryin to be original but this just didn't satisfy me. Watch this if nothing else on or to do."
4,Good for the price,This worked good for my sons Poseidon Halloween costume. He is ten and the only thing bad was the mouth part kept sliding down but it is made for a adult not a child. Also he talks a lot so I'm sure that had something to do with it. If it would have been for more than a night we would of glued it somehow. I put it up and will be used time and time again for future costumes.
4,An instant beard! Must be magic!,This beard is crazy! Looks great for a wizard or Santa or whatever really. It can get tangled and messed up pretty quick so be watchful. The eyebrows do not come with the package but that doesn't really take away from how awesome this beard is!
4,Good for a few uses,"Looks good, but it only lasts for a few uses. By the fourth use of this wig it was coming apart and the hair was in my eyes constantly. Also if you were this at a party as i did its a pain with drinking and especially eating. Also the eyebrows in the picture do not come with the wig and beard."
3,sanctuary,i don't remember ordering this. i will dig through my pile of movies to watch. its probably there? then i'll let you know
2,"low budget, poor acting","two stars, one for spending some money actually producing this movei, another star for having it on Amazon.Unless you are absolutely bored and have nothing to do, like me, and have Amazon prime membership where you can watch for free, don't bother watching this flick.This is a waste of time and ""money"" if you spent anything on it.The only thing left after watching this movie is the desire to go scout a vase that looks like the antique vase in the movie.So, I am going to search in Amazon now for something that looks like it."
5,"""Can't put it down!""","From the heart of one who sincerely wishes to please God, we have a treasure. For those seeking a life of devotion to Him, we have a classic in the making. My brother and colleague of 20 years has written a masterpiece. He leads one of America's great megachurches. The Body of Christ will benefit from Kenny's witness and words. You will yearn for God after reading this book!"
1,Weak batteries & USB charger is NO good!,"The batteries (4xAAA) that come with this charger are only 750mAh. You can't even find rechargeable batteries with that low capacity.Since this charger works off the Wii's USB (or even on a PC) port, in order for this charger to work (recharge batteries in remote), your Wii must be powered ON all the time which translates in to ""shortening"" your Wii's life span."
4,Does the Job,"Does what you would expect an HDMI cable to do. Comes with plastic end protectors, so you can take it places without worry of dirt in the ends."
2,Not the Place to Start for Reagan Fans,"Greatest moments? Not really. This is a decent compilation for neophytes who have never heard of Reagan but I would look elsewhere. If you have the money to spend first I would recommend the more comprehensive ""Ronald Reagan: The Great Communicator"" (MPI) which is a treasure trove of rare clips from a mindblowing GE commercial made in the 1950s to an extended look at the greatest moments of the Reagan presidency. Every clip you need is on that series. Otherwise, I thought PBS did an admirable job--basically a balanced look--but lacking the one thing Reagan fans crave: Reagan in his own words."
3,Chill and Enjoy...,"I Don't Know Whether The Lyrics To This CD Are Printed Like This Out of Pretentiousness Or Ignorance, But It Certainly Is Darned Annoying! That gripe aside, Voce is a fun CD that combines a touch of Celtic with dollops of dance, trance, and techno to create a medium-tempo collection of songs with intense lyrics that tend to cast something of a spell as they weave their way through your listening room. Although the liner notes and lyrics seem to indicate that vocalist Harrington thinks he has something really profound to give to the world, the strength of this music seems to lie much more in its form than in its content. Chill and enjoy."
4,A Good Writer from the Recent Past,"Recently I read an article published several years ago in The Boston Globe about two prominent 20th Century writers who are now largely forgotten. Perhaps it says something about me that I have read both and enjoyed their work. They are Calder Willingham and Hamilton Basso.I finished Basso's ""The View from Pompey's Head"" just last week. It is slow moving in a pleasant, languid, distinctly Southern manner. Basso gradually develops memorable characters, crafts fine scenes and steadily hones the plot - with the ultimate Southern shocker of miscegenation!""The View From Pompey's head"" spent 40 weeks on The New York Times Bestseller List in the 1950s and was made into a Hollywood motion picture starring Richard Egan and the ravishing Dana Wynter. Basso published 11 books and edited The New Yorker for 20 years but is virtually forgotten today. Basso and ""The View From Pompey's Head"" deserve a wider audience and greater appreciation from readers in 2005."
2,virginia who?,"i'm sorry, but i couldn't even finish this book. i bought it used only because i thought oh, virginia is so famous! she must be wonderful! but was astonished at the lack of human thought that showed up, the lack of sense. i really had no idea of what was happening, even though i made it to pg. 100. jacob just runs on and on about sophocles, about greek philosophy--oh he's so deep. deep enough to make you regret getting this book."
3,"Well-written, but not for someone looking for a good story","Let me start off by saying that I read this book for a university class, and that I probably wouldn't have this book from front to back otherwise. That being said, after finishing it for the course, I think the book will appeal to some readers but seem like nonsense to others. Anyone looking for a straight-forward, clear story with a ""traditional"" literary storyline will be sorely dissappointed. The plot is really choppy and the ""storyline"" (if you can call it that) doesn't really matter.Rather, the whole point of the book is it's prose, and Woolf's momentary glances on life and the smallest details of human living. It's also very dense, full of different narrators, and at many times difficult to follow and slow to get through. But some short moments contain brilliance. I might suggest choosing another Woolf novel to read, unless you're looking for a different type of beauty, in which case, choose this one."
1,I had to see what all the fuss is about,"With everyone raving about Woolf, I thought I would download one of her books. I could not get into it at all and didn't bother to finish it."
2,Harcourt annotated kindle edition - riddled with typos,"I'm shocked by the apparent lack of copy editing or even proof reading on the electronic version of this edition. The scholarly apparatus is excellent, but hard to access readily while reading because there is no functioning table of contents. The text itself frequently includes not only misspelled words but random punctuation marks, such as parentheses substituted for ""J""s. No wonder it's less than 3 bucks. Why can't they just use the typesetting from the print version?That said, the scholarly material in this edition is outstanding."
1,"""Stream of consciousness""","""Stream of consciousness"" really says it all. I read three chapters and quit. If you read Ulysses and loved it, you will love this. If you hated it, don't read Jacob's Room. There really seems to be no story here. A scene is described in great detail, someone's thoughts, then another description of another scene. NOTHING HAPPENS. To me a story is about people and their experiences, dialogue, events. Here is just one example, ""But intimacy--the room was full of it, still, deep, like a pool. Without need of movement or speech it rose softly and washed over everything, mollifying, kindling, and coating the mind with the lustre of pearl, so that if you talk of a light, of Cambridge burning, it's not languages only. It's Julian the Apostate."" If you can make sense of that, by all means, read this book. I can't, sorry."
2,Not my thing,"This was the first Virginia Woolf book I had read, and the ""stream of consciousness"" method did not work for me. I was expecting there to be a plot eventually, but there wasn't. It seems that Woolf was a talented writer, although a little complex and difficult to read, like William Faulkner. However, with Faulkner there is a clear development of a story that can keep me interested. I know this was experimental writing, and I plan on reading another of her books, one that is a more conventional novel. I'm no literary critic, and my judgement certainly means very little, but I didn't enjoy reading the book very much."
4,Almost there but not quite,"Jacob's Room was written before most of Virginia Woolf's more famous novels (Dalloway, To the Lighthouse, etc.) and does not quite compare to her later work. It is an interesting novel in that it is her first experimental work and has flashes of brilliance that will make your skin tingle. But at times I was not able to make heads or tails out of what I was reading. I believe that Virginia Woolf's brilliance and intention are more accessible in her later works."
2,Rambling,"Difficult to follow and couldn't understand the characters. There was no connection from chapter to dhapter, and not what I expected."
4,GOOD DARK STUFF,Rendell is the only writer I can think of who consistently breaks a cardinal rule of story writing. That the reader should empathize or identify somewhat w/ one of the characters. That's enough to turn off many readers I'm sure. It's a very hard trick to pull off and she's not always successful. This book works though. It does go on a bit-it's more of a stretched-out novella. And the end is very unsatisfying. But there's good stuff in there.
2,"Not high on the thrill scale, but enjoyable","One Across, Two Down is a light read. Not to say that it's boring because it's not. But the signature Rendell thrills-and-chills isn't here. Oh sure, of course, there's a murder or two, but then there always is with Ms. Rendell's books. Stanley, a crossword puzzle aficionado, is a perennial loser despite his impressive command of the English language. The whole story revolves around him and all throughout this character reminded me of Inspector Clouseau (Pink Panther) - bumbling, egocentric, inept and hilarious. Everything Stanley touches turns to dust or chaos. If you want an undemanding and entertaining Rendell story, try this."
3,greed,"smooth, if inconsequential narrative. economical with word and psychologically insightful. reminiscent of hitchcock's black and white t.v. tales."
5,The Dog,I have watched all of the Jesse Stone movies. They are unique and suspenseful. Tom Selleck as well as all the supporting actors are right on. The dog is my favorite of all the supporting cast.So much soul in those brown eyes.....
4,Jesse Stone continues,Wasn't all that sure that another Jesse Stone story would be just another boiler-plate special. It could have been.Am happy to say I enjoyed it emmensly. The story rocked along very well - enough mystery to satisfy and the endingintriguing. I highly recommend it
4,Tom Selleck at his best,"Jesse Stone: Benefit of the Doubt is one of the best, so far, of the Jesse Stone series. The story is dark, Jessie is his usual self, few words, lots of thought and some action. This movie is a thought piece like all of the Jessie Stone movies. I hope Tom Selleck continues to make these movies."
5,Tom Sellect is Jesse Stone,Tome Sellect is Jesse Stone and Blue Bloods Chief. They could not have found anyone who could have filled the two parts any better. I do have all of the Jesse Stone movies so far.
4,No Doubt,"I like watching Jesse Stone's movies. There is something relaxing about the quiet tone of Jesse's voice, but something seemed to be missing from this show. There seemed to be a little too much banter and drinking with not enough of a story. I still enjoyed this movie and I will watch it again. I am waiting for #9."
5,Great service and value,"A definite ""must-have"" for all Jesse Stone fans. A addition to our Jesse Stone collection. I would recommend. Good service and value"
5,No doubt it's another winner,"My 82 year old mom who has been a fan of Mr Selleck since ""Magnum P.I."" has all of these movies and was so thankful he hasnt quit making episodes. If you love the series you will love that Jesse is back in his position as Chief and that most of his supporting cast is back as well. Great characters including the dog who finally gets over the lost of his murdered master enough to accept Jesse as home instead of just shelter. Hurry up on the next episode, Mr Selleck....she is 82....just sayin'."
5,"How Could You, Jesse?","Benefit of the Doubt concluded before I was ready, Jesse! I wanted to see Hasty dealt with; I needed more time with Suitcase; I wanted to meet Jen, Jesse! I saw the first 4 Jesse Stone movies on Netflix. I rented 5-7 through Amazon, and purchased Benefit of the Doubt at Walmart. All I really have to say is, ""Wow, Jesse"". I have enjoyed every character (canine and human), the side plots and the murder mysteries. I applaud Tom Selleck and his team. This series has been so much FUN! I canot wait for the 9th installment. Please hurry back into my life, Jesse. LOL!"
2,jesse stone,"i waited and waited for this to come out on dvd, and boy was I disappointed. I couldn't even believe the ending - very, very weak."
5,Own all the Jesse Stone DVD's and look forward to more.,Always look forward to watching Tom Selleck play Jesse Stone and solve crime in a small town. Enjoy the acting in the movie and also have read all the books and find them to be well worth the read.
4,Stone returns.,Tom Selick returns as Jesse Stone. Stone becomes chief once again as his replacement dies in a mysterious bomb blast. Stone must put back the police department and solve the case with his usual determination and intuition. This movie might have been made for TV but the main characters are good and the movie aspires to be better than it is.
3,Jesse Stone: Benefit of the Doubt,"I love Tom Selleck movies, but this one was so predictable that even I had everything figured out in the first 15 minutes!"
3,Movie,I have several movies in the Jesse Stone collection. This was not as good as some of the others in the collection. Wanted to add to the collection.
5,excellent,can not wait for them to continue (I hope they do) making this series of movies just love the entire collection.
5,jesse stone,"Great, as always Tom Selleck does a great job in the role of police chief. BUT--he will always be Magnum to me."
3,No Benefit of the Doubt for this video,I have enjoyed the previous Jesse Stone movies but this one just did not quite have it.It was slow and seemed too long as a result. There was some untied loose ends that left me wondering why I had watched the whole thing.
4,Stone Keeps Up His Record,"With the sad passing of the original author, the current Jesse Stone series just keeps on getting better and better. No wonder that the TV series with Selleck is so popular!"
5,Great Movie,I love Tom Selleck and this movie is his latest to come out for Jessie Stone. It arrived on time and in good condition.
5,"""Moody, Intelligent and Nicely Filmed""","A very good, moody film with beautiful music and a great canine domesticus. The plot is leisurely, easy to follow and embellished by quirky characters. I was also impresed by the really nice camera work panning over gorgeous outdoor vistas. There really isn't too much to criticize in this film, which actually lives up quite well to its predecessors as part of an intelligent, well-received dramatic series."
5,I enjoyed it very much,"I have thoroughly enjoyed al the Jesse Stone stories, both the books and the movies. The movies did not depart much from the books which makes them delightful watching. Robert B. Parker is a master of story telling. It is a shame that this movie may be the end of the Jesse Stone movies"
5,Jesse Stone: Benefit of the Doubt,"Tom Selleck is excellent. This series is well-written and the viewer cares about the characters. The next one should bring Rose and ""Suit"" back to the station!"
2,boring not the best,"i don't want too se jesse sleeping or in a stuper , plus not wanting to share info with anyone else or want help we all share the same view not the best jesse stone film"
5,JESSE STONE - BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT.,I HAVE THE ENTIRE COLLECTION OF JESSE STONE SERIES. THIS WAS THE LAST ONE THAT I DID NOT HAVE. PRICE WAS GOOD. SERVICE WAS EXCELLENT. QUALTIY WAS GOOD.
4,"Still strong, but a bit slow paced.","The last episode in this series is still very good, but not quite as incisive as the others before it. Still better than 95% of what you'll see. Highly recommended."
4,Benefit of the Doubt,Tom Sellick is great as Jessie Stone again but the story line is not as well written as were the ones written by Robert B. Parker.
4,Jesse Stone: Benefit of the Doubt,"I did enjoy this movie although I felt it was not quite as exciting as the previous movies. I have seen all eight of the Jese Stone films as I am a big fan of Tom Selleck. This last movie did leave it open, however, for another follow up."
5,great,Tom Selleck does a great job. Buy the entire set of Jesse Stone movies to really understand him and his place in Paradise.
3,Average Jesse,"I have watched on video all the Jesse Stone movies. Can't fault the actors and character development (including the dog!) but the plot gets a little fuzzy towards the end..still trying to figure out some of the details. Love the characters, though! Maybe I should have a ""Jesse"" marathon and see if that helps figure out some of the plot details. Warning: some of the shots of burned bodies are particularly gruesome."
3,Jesse Stone: Benefit of the Doubt,I was disappointed that closed captioned was not included. Had I thought to check I would not have ordered it.
5,Another excellent Jesse Stone,"I own all the Jesse Stone movies, and re-watch them. ""Benefit of the Doubt"" is the same superb quality as all the others.I'm sure all of Robert B. Parker's many fans miss him as much as I. The Jesse Stone movies are a fitting tribute to a great writer.Well done, Mr. Selleck!"
3,Not quite Jesse...,"Robert B Parker was a very good writer in the Stone/Spenser novels. The job done with the current people is good, only because it will have a glimpse of the character developed by Parker. They really don't live up to his standards, but still manage to create a good story, weather through its reference to Jesse is hard to say."
3,Not up to snuff IMO..,"I agree with most of the reviews on IMDB.If I remember the first 4 or 5 in the series were quite good. This onefalls short and it sure drags on.It is like slow motion..as if no onereally wants to be there, including Jessie. Everyone in this picture isjust struggling. What is the meaning of life.The car dealer as someone noted is indeed a caricature."
1,CD stopped playing about an hour into movie,There was a scratch on the cd. I supposedly bought a new cd. Not sure how a new cd can get scratched. Warranty period has passed. Will not buy from Omers Treasures again.
1,Wrong region,It was disappointing that I was unable to play on Australian DVD player due to wrong region so could only view on PC or laptop
5,Jesse Stone,"As usual, Tom Selleck is great as Jesse Stone. I love the twist and turns of the stories and the newest one gives all of that and more."
5,"As always, GREAT","The Jesse Stone movies are a great series. You can watch them without your TV Guardian bleeping most of the audio. I enjoy watching a movie without being offended by all the senseless violence and profanity. I hope Tom Selleck continues to make these,"
4,Good video. Sorry to see it's the last one.,"According to Tom Selleck this was probably the last of the Jesse Stone series because of the amount of money it took to make them. Given that I really wish they would have finished it by catching the bad guy ""Hasty"" instead of seeing him leaving on a boat."
5,Another great Jesse Stone Saga movies,I like all of the Jesse Stone Movies. Tom Selleck is perfect as Jesse Stone. I'm not a Sony Pictures Home Entertainment fan but like the Stone movies very much.
4,Liked the movie ; didnt love it like the previous movis,I really loved the previous Jesse Stone movies but this one lacked what the other movies had I can't explain it this one was predictable and not enough emotion as the previous movies. I really hope if there is as next Jesse Stone movie that the script is way better
5,Another good one!,"If you like Jesse Stone, you will like this movie. It follows the series butcould stand alone. Many of the main charactersare in it and it has a good story line."
3,Informative but a little outdated.,"A lot of good solid information on macrobiotics, but too much text and not enough pictures."
2,An Oldie that Hitchcock likely viewed,"In interviews, Alfred Hitchcock frequently explains how he creates drama and suspense. At one of those moments he states, ""Keep the Eleventh Commandment. Thou shall not be found out."" In other words, Once found out, the gig is up.So, when I saw the title ""The Eleventh Commandment (Thou Shall Not be Caught)"", I instantly knew that this film was one that Hitch also viewed. As a fan, I am compelled to do things like this. However, I would not recommend this film for the usual purpose of entertainment. It is an oldie, the sound track buzzes, the acting is out of style and the actors are all dead."
1,Hi-Capacity Li-ion Camcorder Battery Sony CCD-V110 & CCD-V30 (NP-22) (,Totally a rip off. I'll never buy on Amazon again. Both batteries were Ni-CAD not Li-Ion and they don't last as long as my old Ni-CAD's do. There is nowhere to complain and they are VERY EXPENSIVE Ni-CAD's.
2,Did not finish it.,I love American history but this book is not what I expected. Very very dry. Reads like a textbook. I tried but finally gave it up.
3,"Good, but not the best, and a little outdated","I though that Calder did an excellent job of simplifying relativity theory, which I suppose was his goal. I found myself wishing that he had not simplified quite so much, and explained WHY things happen instead of WHAT happens, as he tends to do sometimes. In addition to that, this book is a little behind the times when it comes to theories (though Calder can hardly be blamed for that, seeing as he wrote it before these new theories were developed). Overall, it is a good introduction to relativity theory, very easy to understand, but you will probably need another deeper book or two to really get a grasp on it."
1,Fascinating Science Fails To Entrap The Average Reader,"While the subject of Einstein's Relativity is one that one can marvel over for hours, Calder's simplification lacked the elements to inspire one who does not have a passion for physics. His chapters that offered analogies and antecdotes fascinate me, drawing me into his complex reasoning and leaving me dumbfounded by the wonders of the universe. Yet more often, Calder simply was translating a difficult theoretical papaer into one with more common words, leaving the reader to get bored, becoming lost in a sea of scientific jargon and ideas that cannot be well visually conceptualized without the aid that Calder did not provide. For those with more of a passion for physics, you might enjoy the book more."
2,This s not a toy,"This is a good collectors item for young girls. The line provides one of these for birth, each birthday and marriage. This is not a toy. It is a traditional gift for grand daughters and a good buy. If Amazon listed it as a traditional collectors item I would rate it a five in every category."
5,Top Grade!,"Let's Go Rock Collecting is an excellent book in the Let's Read and Find Out Science Series. My son started with this book when he was 4 (he's now 5). It has great illustrations that capture a child's attention and actual photos of the various rocks described so that the child (and parent) can identify a few basic rocks.One thing that is really great about this book is the simple illustrations to educate the reader about the Earth's Crust and Solid Rock Layer. There are simple diagrams of:1. The components of a Volcano2. Moh's Scale of hardness3. The formation of sedimentary rocks4. Metamorphic rock processThe book also ends with a practical suggestion that kids will love and that's how to begin your own rock collection and start to identify the rocks you have.NOTE: Depending on your view of the age of the earth, you may like to know that this book utilizes millions of years in its descriptions."
5,AN EXCELLENT INTRODUCTION TO ROCKHOUNDING,"THIS IS A FINE BOOK FOR INTRODUCING YOUR CHILDREN TO THE WONDERS OF ROCKHOUNDING. THE AUTHOR BELIEVES THAT CHILDREN WANT TO READ AND FIND OUT FOR THEMSELVES. LET YOUR CHILDEN READ THIS BOOK, AND THEN TURN THEM LOOSE ON ANY NORTHERN BEACH WITH PLENTY OF ROCKS. THEY'LL HAVE A BALL, AND YOU'LL LEARN SOMETHING, TOO (YOUR KIDS WILL TELL YOU)."
4,Beginning Reader,"This book is goo for your child interested in starting a collection, and science. It can be read by the child and understood, but it doesn't have many rock descriptions. So I ended up purchasing a rock field guide so my son could identify what he was finding."
3,Could be better.,"This is really 3 1/2 stars. I am a fan of YLT's faster, more repetative, darker, more chaotic tracks. ""I heard you looking"" and ""Sugarcube"" made it... but where is Alyda, Double Dare, Decora (studio version), and Flying Lesson ??? !!! On a 2 disc set I would expect at least a couple of these. I realize this review is biased. Fans that appreciate Yo La Tengo accross the board will of course put this at 4 or 5."
2,Yes imitators enjoy a short career.,"Part of a strange trend in the '70s when bands started imitating other bands to the hilt, Druid was fascinated with the sound of Yes. Complete with all the basic Yes ingredients - high-pitched vocals, Rickenbacker bass, banks of keyboards - Druid went off hell-bent to prove to the world that they could sound like Yes. The point of this exercise in mimickery remains a mystery. Toward The Sun is one of the few progressive rock albums where the mellotron is so over-used, it actually starts to get on your nerves. Fluid Druid finds the band a little leaner and meaner, but the unhealthy Yes fascination still grates. After just two albums, Druid wisely called it a day. Recommended for desperate progressive rock fanatics only."
5,"You wont believe it, finally a good book!","Regina is a girl about 10 years old when she is captured by the Indians. Her Father and brother are scalped. However, Regina travels miles and miles until finally she gets to the indian village where she will stay. She was expecting a warm welcome but instead she had to... If you want to find out more read the book. I liked this book because it was a true story and had alot of action."
1,Háven't received the book yet!,"This order has never been received and I no longer need the book. I have never had trouble before with an order from Amazon used books, it is very disappointing and I will hesitate to use this service again. I would like a refund.Glenda Miller"
3,i thought it was okay...,if i hadnt had to read it for school i would not have read i am regina. however i thouth the book was well written and you could actually picture what was happening to regina-kj
3,Good book? For whom?,"This book was recently adopted by my school district, and Iread it in preparation for its use in my 7th grade classroom. Although as an adult I found the story moving, I am left with a number of questions as to its appropriateness for some young readers. Parents and teachers be warned--this book contains detailed descriptions of scalpings, burnings, alcoholism, and attempted rape. The review provided by Amazon is correct--it is faith that gets the main character through ... . This book was adopted in my district to be used with lower level readers--the same population that may have trouble thinking critically about the books difficult and sometimes disturbing themes."
5,indians are good and bad,"i luved this book it was so goodreginia wasso brave and careng and she looked out for her ""sister""i cried when the india lady was killedandi sat on theedge of my chair when he was drunk and tried marrying reginai would recomend this book to anyoneif you liked this book buy savage cinderella also a good book"
3,Not bad. Not bad at all.,"I read this book simply for the sake of reading something, and I was suprised that I liked it as much as I did.(This is normally not the kind of book I read.) I really got close to Regina by the end of the book, and enjoyed moving through rough and happy times with her. It is not a book I would read again, but I'm still glad I read it."
1,"Sticky, gives acne, impossible to wash out","I didn't like this gel/wax at all. It's WAY too sticky, heavy and leaves clumps in the hair. It's nearly impossible to wash of your hands, not to mention wash out of the hair! The fact that it gave me breakouts and acne in the forehead after a couple of days in use just goes to show it's the worst hair gel I've ever used:/ Only people I can imagine it would work for is if you have very short hair and would like hard spikes."
5,After reading the other six in this series...,"Story seemed to run a little slower than the others, but I think that was because of the way we were moved around in the areas that also had importance to the goings on....I had enjoyed the other six books in this series... and I hope more are written...This series would definitely make a good movie, and also a good TV series."
3,Interesting but should be read in order,"This book is much better and faster moving than the last two.More character develoment, although somewhat predicable. Still wonder how they get anything done, since they seem to jump in and out of bed with anyone, male or female. I usually reread books I like. Could not bring myself to reread the last two but will probably reread this one."
4,Little slower than i like!!!!!!,"I love the Series but my intrests began to wain with this book. I will read the next one but it seems the series is getting Slower and Slower to resolve the plot in each book. like the plot in last book was finally resolved ,kinda. I love the series and enjoy it thoroughly so i gave the book 4 stars since it was good if a bit slow and has a very evil twist(One im not sure if I like). Besides she cant come up with any more names with a K, Or Can She.(to you Lisanne from a dedicated fan who hopes you will keep your web SITE UP TO DATE FOR ONCE!!! Plz. :-)"
2,could not get into this book,"I just do not know why but I have owned this book for 2 years and I have not been able to get past the first couple of chapters. Normally, I will hang in there and finish a book but not this one. Maybe the story just got to tiring for me."
3,Not bad,"Let me start by saying that I enjoyed reading this book and have enjoyed reading the series; however, I wouldn't say it was one of the best in the series. It follows a predictable storyline that serves to fill several hours of time but isn't particularily mindblowing. I will probably buy the next book in the series and be entertained if not bettered having spent my time reading it. Oh well.Much praise for Turning Point and Wheel of Time. They were the best written books in the series.If you want to read a really good series, check out the Dune Series by Frank Herbert. It will change the way you think about science fiction."
5,Heartwarming,All the time I play his CD my heart swells up and I play it over and over again. It's even more beautiful when it makes you remember the one you love. It's a beautiful CD to listen to when you are with that someone special. Viva la romance!!!
1,Google maps is better,"I am very dissapointed with the maps, the graphics are terrible making it impossible to find your way. The legend has obivously been created by a child. Google maps will give you clearer maps and best of all it is free"
4,An Ancient Greek Anti-War Play.,"This ancient Greek play by the famous playwrite Euripides is a diatribe on war and the foolishness of pride. The play is often thought to be an incomplete work, but as Dimock points out in the introduction, recent discoveries suggest that IPHIGENEIA AT AULIS isn't as incomplete as once thought. This edition includes a fine introduction, several detailed notes on the text, and a glossary of proper nouns. The book is not too difficult to read and can be useful for students of the theatre and/or ancient Greek culture."
3,"Red Balloon is wonderful, White Mane is NOT","I loved the red balloon as a child and I just bought this video for my own children. They loved Red Balloon and we all hatedWhite Mane. First, the story is boring. Second, there is a fight scene between White Mane and another horse that is very real and not enjoyable to watch. I would say, the only thing White Mane has going for it, is the beatiful country that it was filmed in and that is not enough to recomend buying this movie.I gave a 3 star rating because Red Balloon gets 5 and White Mane gets 1. That is an average of 3..."
3,UPS Battery For Belkin F6C700,The terminals are 3/16 and my UPS ARE 1/4. listing STATED THEY WERE DIRECT REPLACEMENT FOR MY MODEL ups.
3,The Worst Witch,This book was exciting at times but had some boring parts. It was interesting and funny at times but sometimes a letdown and boring. Kind of to kiddy for me.
2,Deluxe wine goblets Martini glasses stemware chest,"not really what I had hoped for. Flimsy, and only adequate for bubble wine stems. Would not recommend this product since it doesn't really meet the need for storage."
4,Sized right,"I have really large Mikasa Red Goblet stems and these fit. Just barely, but I could get all six into the container. These are very functional for storage and keeping dust off of stemware."
5,Nice for the Money,"I really like this whole family of quilted covers for glassware and china. These are not ""boxes""- they are not meant to have things stacked on top of them. I used them to move my own china in my car and keep pieces clean and dust free in my home."
3,25 % biography of Enrico Fermi.,"Laura Fermi explains her husband life: the family, the adventures of the italian physicists, the Nobel prize, the American life, the Manhattan project. But Fermi life is full of physics, and in the book you don't find any explanation of the discoveries which took most of his time. It is a pity that Laura didn't get more information from her husband work to realize how great it was and how it influenced the future of quantum mechanic. Fermi was one of the top ones. I recommend this book as a preliminar biography but not as a deep one."
5,Phenomenal variety that keeps you coming back!,"The variety in this CD is truly remarkable. While listening, I wait in anticipation for the next song because I know it's going to be totally different than the one I just heard. Every song is within itself a collage of melodies, rhythms and beats. I'm a studio cycling instructor and have used several songs from this CD in my classes. It's an awesome piece of artwork - a MUST for someone looking for a taste of something different."
5,Strong and Reliable.,"Just make sure you open the box correctly so it dispenses properly. Good stuff, great price. Strong and reliable... Planning to buy this again when mine runs out..."
3,Nice but stinks.,This is a nice quality door but if you are sensitive to odors this door stinks. It has the heavy vinyl smell that just does not go away.
1,Disappointed Fan,The audio and video of this production is inferior to many VHS tapes. Don't waste your money.
1,Beware!,I don't know who did these DVD'S but they are poor quality and inaccurate. If you are fortunate to have taped the Harvest Jazz series from A&E you probably have better quality.The Dexter Gordon/McCoy Tyner DVD is in the same condition
2,Not what I expected,"The picture showed a nice looking Utah helmet, but I received a faded, old looking helmet. While I do not fault the seller necessarily, Amazon has done this to me in the past. Not sure I can trust them on all items. It would be nice to have a picture of the actual item I am buying."
4,Great piece of investigative journalism that gives you a real flavor of early 20th century America,"This is the story of how one of the century's greatest magicians tracked down a gambler who could do what most slight-of-hand artists only dreamed about: deal cards from the center of the deck. This move, the ""holy grail"" of card manipulation is really just little more than the MacGuffin in this intriguing page-turner of a story.Even if you are not the slightest bit interested in magic, card tricks or gambling, this is a fascinating read.You will be transported to the first third of the 20th century into a story full of memorable and colorful characters. Johnson's attention to detail and the thoroughness of his investigation is nothing short of miraculous.One of the most purely entertaining books I've read in quite some time."
5,More than just a magic read...,"This book goes far beyond most biographical treatments that you see in the field of magic. Yes, it talks about Vernon and his search for Bill Kennedy, and yes, it delves into the magic that they shared (although it was not magic to Kennedy; it was a way of making a living). ""Magician and the Cardsharp"" reads more like time travel. Johnson superbly takes you back into the past, and gives you a true ""you are there"" feeling. It reads like a novel, and that is an excellent thing...because you find yourself caring about the characters and seeing how they relate to their surroundings. Superb book; highest recommendation, even if you don't care about magic at all."
5,Great history,"If you're interested in the history of magic and the life of Dai Vernon, this is an excellent read. Essentially a biography of ""The Professor"" with a fascinating back-story woven in."
4,"Interesting story about an interesting man, reads like a novel","Magic and magicians have fascinated me since a young age. I remember learning about this magician, Dai Vernon, who was considered the greatest magician of the 20th century. His obsession with perfecting his magic, and learning from the best practitioners is legendary.This book details his search for the impossible move, being able to deal a card from the center of the deck. His search reads like a detective novel, fast moving and fun to read. Highly recommended."
2,"Not bad, as plays OK too!","I needed one of these for an event at work. I figured, order one: if it plays I'll keep it. If not, I'll return it. I was happy to find this was an instrument and not just a decoration. It had a few small dents, and the union between the two halves didn't fit perfectly, but I used it and played fanfares off and on for several hours. I used the mouthpiece from my regular trumpet, instead of the one provided, and found playing it was acceptable. I had lower expectations based only on the price, and felt I got a good deal!"
1,Don't waste your time on this garbage,"I read the Grisham book on which this garbage film is based. It was several years between the time I read the book and when this film came out. Initially, I was wondering if I'd read the book by the same title.Dramatic license does not even come close to describing the liberties the filmmaker took. The book dealt w/ big tobacco but, apparently, the screenwriter/director had an anti-gun axe to grind and substituted big tobacco w/ the firearm industry instead.Needless to say I was very disappointed. Good performances by Gene Hackman and Bruce McGill; otherwise, a thoroughly forgettable film. Borrow the book from the library and save yourself the $9.00."
1,Great Acting Ruined By Politics,"Stellar performances by all actors and actresses involved in this movie are ruined by the sheer ignorance of the topic. Not one single ""fact"" about guns contained in this movie was true and at the end of the film I had nothing but an overwhelming feeling that the bad guys had clearly won. What a crock!"
3,"Thanks to Rachel Weisz and Gene Hackman, this film is ok.","John Grisham should be livid over the way they took his book and basically lobotomize his book and literally killed it with a stupid screenplay that really should have been a different movie. I agree with almost everyone that the acting is the only godsent with Rachel Weisz and Gene Hackman doing their best to keep you interested with what is going on and Dustin Hoffman doing his best to keep up. Other than them, the movie really is not worth your time. See it for the good effort made by Weisz, Hackman, and Hoffman but don't look for anything beyond their performances because it's the performances that makes this movie much more than it really is."
1,Gun control propaganda,"This movie is perfect example of how lawyers have made the segue from tobacco to guns to fast food and who knows what's next. This BOOK was about a tobacco trial....changing it to anti-gun propoganda was quite easy for them....boy they got school shooting and a whole bunch of liberal junk in here.Don't spend the money, don't waste your time."
1,READ THE BOOK!!!,"This movie was not up to par. I've heard that many people liked this movie, yet none of them have read the book. I read the book and loved it, and expected more of the same from the movie. Yet it did not live up to my expectations. I suggest that you buy the book and not the movie."
3,Preachy letdown that is a choir to sit though.,"Preachy and stagnated legal thriller that really does not hold it's water in the department of credibility. The issue of guns is unwarned in this story, and the direction is way off key in certain scenes. The book made sense because of the way that the tobacco industry was hiding the information about the effects of smoking from the public but the story here makes no sense because the gun issue is very divided in this country. The acting is the only plus here, and in a way, a sigh of what could have been a much better movie. I agree with almost everyone who saw this movie that Gene Hackman and Rachel Weisz gave the movie some dignity with their stellar performances but an actor could only do but so much with out the help of a good script or a director who knows what he is doing.The two stars are for Hackman and Weisz, but the movie gets zero for the lack of a real effort to support them."
3,4 stars for the great actors & 1 star for the plot change,"As is the case with most screen adaptations of novels there are always points left out. The film Runaway Jury is no exception, changing the court case from a fight against the Tobacco industry to the more current target, Gun manufacturers. It's unfortunate that the film studio, producer or whoever decided to take an already good story and politicize it by attacking gun manufacturers. In fact it had been quite some time since I had read the book and actually forgot that it was Tobacco and not Guns! Gene Hackman turns in his usual outstanding performance, as does John Cusack. Being an 80s SNL fan, I enjoyed seeing Nora Dunn in the film. So overall, I rate Runaway Jury a 3, almost"
2,Not a realistic movie.,"The acting was pretty good, but the story was totally unrealistic. They ruined what I thought was a good book. There are jury consultants who help lawyers pick juries, but they do not operate like in this movie. A person CANNOT get on a jury like Cusack did, just to try and arrange a verdict. All of these people were guilty of jury tampering, which is a felony, but no no one ever acts the least bit concerned that they might go to jail. What was the point of all this as the gun company could have easily gotten a new trail because Cusack lied duing his jury exam and apparently gave a phony name, ID, etc. Also, what was Jenifer Beals doing in this movie? She was on the jury, but never spoke a word (that I remember) and really had no part at all. Was her part cut from the movie?"
3,Good acting can&#65533;t hide all the flaws,"Bad translation of John Grisham bestseller lacks his surprise twist and charm because of the bad decision over changing the plot for a liberal stance against guns. The acting is good despite the bad tasted the movie leaves in your mouth and that is a major plus. Gene Hackman, Dustin Hoffman, and Rachel Weisz do their best work here but not even they can hide all the flaws this movie has. More over, the movie lacks a coherent narrative, and a certain sense of stability. I suggest watching the movie for the acting alone but you still would have do get through the movie as a whole."
3,Split Decision,"Happened to be in New Orleans while this was filming, and was looking forward to seeing the city in the movie. Didn't see much. Never expected much real law, was not disappointed. Liked Cusak, Hoffman wasted, Hackman huffed and puffed. Good movie for a Saturday night at home, nothing special."
2,"See it for Hackman and Weisz, other than that don&#65533;t bother","Dumb, and contrived caper that insults the viewer in every level with it's unbelievable clutches, and it's preaching to the choir views on guns which in a way makes not sense considering that the movie is more about jury tampering than guns in the first place. Gene Hackman and Rachel Weisz do a great job considering that the script was written by about three or four people and they make you care about their characters. A hard thing to do considering that you really don't care after a while about what is happening on screen.I usually don't agree with the majority but I really do in this case. See it for the good effort made by Gene Hackman and Rachel Weisz for at least doing their best to keep you interest in the movie. If you don't want to, I suggest renting much better movies by them and skip this movie out right, because it's really not worth your time."
3,I feel very sorry for the actors in this mess of a movie.,"Its very heartbreaking to see such great actors involved in such a mess of a film. The editing is a major down fall as well as the directing, which should have been pull off better. Do not get me started about the script because there is really not one to talk about. All the actors involve do their best with what is there but they should have been giving more to do than what was giving. Gene Hackman, Dustin Hoffman and Rachel Weisz all give great performance but they are left holding the bag by the filmmaker's own mistakes. John Cusack is ok and the rest of the cast is all right but without something for all them to do, they are no more than graph on a page. The story was the movie's down fall, and with out a good story, there is really nothing to hold anybody's interest.What a real shame because Hackman, Weisz, and Hoffman do very good work here, and they should have gotten a better script than what they had."
5,"Great show by Weisz, Hackman,Hoffman, and Cusack.","I'm not a fan John Grisham but I found Runaway Jury quite good. I don't know how accurate the legal system was portrayed in the film, but the story was very engrossing and the performances were really good. Gene Hackman was amazing, and very ruthless in his performance, and Dustin Hoffman as great as his adversary in law. Rachel Weisz was great as Marlee, and she really does almost walk away with the film. John Cusack has been very versatile in his pick of movies lately, and he is proving to be quite a great actor.Again, I don't know if the movie is accurate in it's portrayal of the law but it's a good movie none the less."
2,Bias film that waste the good acting of Weisz and Hackman.,"Low grade John Grisham drama does not practice what its preaches by skirting the issues its trying to convey and goes for the throat in its bias views about gun responsibility. Do we need some kind of moratorium for gun responsibility? In my opinion yes but we do not need a movie that skirts the issues raised by going on a self effacing crusade of judge and jury with out hearing all the facts from both sides of the case. Besides all of that, the actors in this movie do their jobs by giving very good performances despite the hack job of the script they had to work with. Gene Hackman and Rachel Weisz are the standouts in this film and they give the best performances in an all star cast that includes the great Dustin Hoffman, and the charming John Cusack. They are the reasons to sit thou this movie, even when you are moaning at the script self righteousness, and bias smug view."
3,"Weisz and Hackman are the best things here, unfortunately.","I did like the movie, but the whole anti gun preaching and the illogical plot points concerning Jury tampering were a bit much, and highly improbable to be real. The only saving grace here though is the acting, which deserves a much better movie. Gene Hackman and Rachel Weisz really made this film work with their performances. Gene's performance made his character more dimensional than it needed to be, and more though provoking, and Rachel Weisz gives a great performance with a character that really should have had more screen time than she did.Dustin Hoffman was fine but was really no more than scenery and John Cusack was decent but needed more work.To Be Honest, The movie would had not been as good with out the performances of Rachel Weisz and Gene Hackman, and if the movie would have had been in their level of acting, the movie would have been much better."
3,Frantic Grisham drama that misses the mark more than hits.,"Good but not so good John Grisham book made to unfaithful movie has all its targets lock on a great movie but misses them more than hits. Gene Hackman is fine in a role we all know he could do blind folded, andDustin Hoffman is great for the expanded character he has (his character is not a major character in the book.) John Cusack is great as well, and Rachel Weisz blows them all a way with a performance that is better than them all. She is the best thing in this film, and with the entire plot rip away for a moratorium for guns, her performance is one of the few good things about the movie. The other things that make this film fairly decent is the setting which is not from the book at all, but New Orleans is a fine setting for any movie, and The score by Christopher Young is a good choice for this movie.Because of Rachel Weisz, The setting and the score, the film is a fair Friday night at the movies, but don't expect much more than that."
2,"Skip it, other than the acting, there is nothing here.","Dismal retention of the novel by John Grisham leaves out the important stuff and heads for the bad in order to please sensitive people who can't handle the truth about guns and violence in our society. The acting is the only thing here worth mentioning with good performances by Rachel Weisz, and Gene Hackman, and good supporting performances by John Cusack and Dustin Hoffman.Too bad the movie could not be as good as they were."
1,Read the book!,"The book, which focuses on tobacco instead of guns, is superb. Skip the movie and read the book, the best Grisham ever."
1,Non working DVD of Runaway Jury,"I could not give a ""rate"" of stars since the DVD doesn't work it doesn't deserve even one star.All of the previews of other movies were just fine, the first couple of minutes of the movie were just fine and then.................the sound stopped. The picture had lots and lots of little boxes of colors and you could not see the movie itself, just the boxes of colors that seemed to be quivering.Please send another DVD of Runaway Jury, one that really works well and as soon as possible. And noooooooo I do not want to buy an envelope and go to the trouble of having it filled out and shipped back to you since it doesn't work in the first place!!!!!Now, if I receive another DVD of Runaway Jury and it works the whole way through and more than one time, I will then rate you a solid 4.My head hurts."
1,2 hours of thinly veiled lefty propaganda,"If you think you might enjoy 2 hours of anti-gun, leftist propaganda, then this is a great movie. How in the world this movie ever made it past the scripting is beyond me. Although I do have to say there is some great acting by actors I really enjoy, however the bias of this film is beyond what I could endure."
1,One sided,I haven't seen a movie so one-sided since the Contender. They didn't even try to make good arguments for the pro-gun side. I hate to use the term Liberal Bias but in this case it fits like a glove. The cards in this movie were so stacked against the defense team that by the end of the movie I felt like the gun companies were the underdogs. Pure garbage.
3,Much changed from the book,"I just read the book and like it very much, so I wanted to watch the movie. While I understand that they have to leave out a lot of detail in the movie version, I couldn't figure out why they made the plot changes they did. In the book, the trial was personal injury case against a tobacco company, while the movie was against a gun manufacturer."
2,this was not what the book was about.,The book was about the cigarette industry. the movie was changed to the gun industry. The cigarette industry has a monopoly on the negative information that people know about cigarettes. I was taken aback when the movie ignored the details of the book. This movie should not used the titled from the book. The book told us a story about the power and influence of the cigarette company. How they lied to us about the safety of their product. How they addicted young americans (10-12 years old) so that their product will have a long lasting clientel. Nicotine is used to addict the smoker. The industry of death corrupts our legal system and our government. This movie makes a statement that confirms the book original intent. which is that the cigarette companies are the worst scum on this earth.
3,Decent but very lackluster in terms of direction and script.,"Runaway Jury is a good film but it could have been a better film if they had a better script and the right director who knew what he was doing. The acting is the only saving grace here with good performances by Rachel Weisz and Gene Hackman who I agree with many who have posted here, are the only good things that this film has to offer. Dustin Hoffman is also quite good but he's not in the movie much at all and the screenplay just feels way too raw to be a final draft. The dialog is a bit much in certain places and the direction lacks a certain amount of professionalism. It's a good movie, don't get me wrong but with out Rachel Weisz, Gene Hackman and Dustin Hoffman giving class and talent to an otherwise bad directed film with a poor script, the movie would have gotten a one star review from me very easily.The three star review is for them."
2,The jury is still out with this one.,"Derivative John Grisham thriller that puts the gun manufactures on trail but lacks enough evidence to not only put on a compelling case but lacks enough of a punch to put on a good show. Gene Hackman, Rachel Weisz and Dustin Hoffman do their best with what is given but they are working with a script that not only lacks teeth but also lacks a real story to work with. The setting of the film is distracting to the point of nasal, which is pretty bad considering that New Orleans is a great place to behold. The book which this movie came from had enough intelligence and heart to make a real and compelling movie but the studio seem like they wanted to please someone and just thou out everything that made that novel great for this. I wonder who did the studio try to please? Hmmm, Paging Michel Moore Please...Talk about conspiracy theories."
2,Watch it only for Rachel Weisz and Gene Hackman.,"Weak minded and painfully inaccurate film about guns is a slap in the face of those who are trying to find a real solution to the problem. Its really easy to try to find a bad guy in all that has happen but in the real world, the complexity of the problem is more profound than good guys and bad guys and happy ending are hard to come by. Other than that, the script is really choppy in places and the director over stylizes certain scenes a little too much, forgetting the age-old rule of less is more. The acting is great with Rachel Weisz and Gene Hackman stealing scenes left and right, making the movie a little better than it should have been but other than their strong talent, the movie suffers from a misguided purpose of self righteousness. A purpose mined you that are full with Hollywood fantasy.I rather see something with a little more reality to it than a fantasy film that leaves out the truth."
2,A bunch of baloney.,"Self-serving view of the gunfight lacks a compelling argument for what it's trying to say, and a real source for the balance view of things. Jury tampering is a real subject to deal with because it happens everyday but the gun issue at hand should have been a fair fight of views other than the blame game. Other than this major problem, all the actors do well in their roles with Gene Hackman, Rachel Weisz, John Cusack and Dustin Hoffman giving fine performances in this mishmash of conflicting views.See it for them only."
1,This guy used to be a lawyer?,"A great idea for a movie gone awry. It is far too hard to believe anything like this could happen in such a way. A sequestered jury going out for drinks? A sequestered juror with a text-pager... who is able to run away to a secret midnight meeting... a juror sneaking booze into a courthouse... a lawyer with a suitcase loaded with electronics including illegal cameras and recording equipment... seriously, I though Mr. Grisham used to be an attornety. This movie is so hard to believe that it isn't worth attempting to suspend your disbeliefe."
4,Has the usual Grisham twists and turns,"This movie has some major departures from Grisham's book by the same name, but having said that, it is still an interesting movie judged on its own merits. The all-star cast features John Cusack as a young man who insinuates himself onto a jury in order to influence the verdict, Gene Hackman as the relentless lawyer who manipulates everything about the trial in order to win the case for his gun-manufacturing bosses, and Dustin Hoffman as the idealistic lawyer who is representing the widow of a murder victim. There are a few places where the viewer is required to suspend belief because of plot lapses, but generally this is a fast-moving, interesting film which gives a chilling look at the possibilities of influencing a jury in order to favor certain interest groups. Although Grisham has come in for a lot of criticism in recent years, he still produces entertainment which captures and keeps the viewer (or reader's) attention."
2,Disappointing 2 hours of liberal indoctrination,"Watching this movie I was definately convinced that the Democratic National Committee played a role in this movie. Evil Capitalist businessmen, victimization, entitlement, and class warfare intertwined in this hollywood type libral movie. Gun dealers were portrayed as icompetant survivalist wackos. But my favorite was the private room meeting with all the overly done stereotypical ""gun"" business owners. I am sure the ""gun"" will be replace with fast food, oil, walmart, and tobacco for any sequel. Just change the setting and recast the same characters. What we are left with is great actors using their talents as a campaign spot. Hackman at least holds his own. Thank goodness (can't say God) for homeschooling."
2,"Great cast, good premise","but ultimately what runs away isn't the jury, but any sort of cohesive plot. Shame, but it misses almost 100%"
3,"The book was much, much better.","I have been a fan of this book for many years, and was THRILLED when I heard it was going to be made into a movie. With Hackman and Hoffman, I had high hopes. But it seems the movie fell flat, but the one thing that was consistant was the excellent acting.I didn't care for the way they carried the story onto script. But what kept me from turning this review into a 1 or 0 star was the acting.Hackman can do no wrong, it seems. I was the few who adored his acting in The Heist, so I have not seen him fall flat. Hoffman was, as always, excellent. Watching these two Hollywood stars act together was exciting. I was shocked that these two haven't acted together on camera, but it was worth the wait. The 'bathroom' scene was shot terrificly and they kept my interest for the entire movie. Hackman will always be the best Villian of all time. It's hard to really HATE his character, because he finds the emotional blend that makes it perfect.3 stars..............For the acting only."
3,"Respectable because of Hackman, Hoffman, and Weisz.","Strange courtroom drama that does not give a strong argument for its views about guns but gives compelling performances by all the actors involved. Gene Hackman never disappoints, and does make the movie better because of his performance, even though he has played this character before in much better movies. Dustin Hoffman is good as well, even though he is not in the movie too much, and Rachel Weisz gives an amazing performance that lifts this movie pass it's strange and bias views points to something with some dignity to it. It's the actors performances that makes me give this movie three stars, even though the view points express were not really thought out."
4,The best movie I have seen this year.,"Great courtroom Spectacle of a film that not only raises eyebrows with its subject matter but also gives a great look on how we as people should look at ourselves. Gene Hackman gives an Oscar caliber performance in this film, and Rachel Weisz gives one as well, not only holding her own with him but almost even surpassing him as well. Dustin Hoffman was good but he has done better and John Cusack is gives another great performance as well.I did not read the book that this is based on but I hope it's as good as the movie was."
3,Hollywood happened again,"This movie was a good example of Hollywood ruining a good book. The book was fantastic and the ending was great so of course Hollywood had to mess it up in the movie. Also, they changed the court case to guns instead of smoking, I guess since many in Hollywood probably smoke but most agree on gun control. The acting was pretty good and the action was decent too so not all bad."
3,Just did not cut it for me.,"Yes, Gene Hackman, Rachel Weisz, Dustin Hoffman and John Cusack are better than good in this movie, and they deserve much than this. The movie just does not work well in any way, and the whole debate about guns is way wasted in a bad story that does not even address the problem. The whole movie gives new meaning to lazy filmmaking, and hopefully the actors who did this would get some kind of award for bringing life to a meaningless movie."
2,Runaway from this movie.,"I enjoyed the book very much but the movie did not cut it for me one bit. Not only is this movie an abomination of the book that it came from but a good portion of the film did not make sense. I agree with the whole that the acting is the best thing here, and Rachel Weisz and Gene Hackman were the best things this movie had going for it. They at least held my attention while the movie began to fade away. Hopefully, Rachel and Gene can star together in a better movie that is really worthy of their talent other than a movie that wasted it."
2,Gene Hackman and Rachel Weisz make a bad movie look good.,"John Grisham should be livid over the way they butchered his book for an advertisement for gun safety. The original story of the tobacco industry is thrown right out in favor for a democratic approach to gun control that is bias to say the least. The only plus here is the performances, and I really do mean plus because if the performances were as bad as the film, I would have definitely walk out of the theater. Gene Hackman is very good as a man trying to secure a verdict for the gun manufactures, and Rachel Weisz is also very good as a woman trying to secure the verdict for her own gain. John Cusack is good as a juror with a motive, and Dustin Hoffman is fine as a layer with a passion for the truth. With a better director and a better screenplay, the movie would have been Oscar worthy, too bad it's not. What a shame."
3,Weak adaptation to a great book.,"Very Weak adaptation to the John Grisham book has all the flare but none of the substance that made the book such an enjoyable read. This should not even be called Runaway Jury because the premise of the book is not even used in the movie. Gene Hackman is always at his best in what ever he does and Dustin Hoffman is just as good. Its great to have such heavy weight actors involved, and John Cusack hold himself well but its Rachel Weisz who literally steals the film from all three of them with her great performance. She is real reason to see this movie, even when the movie itself is not really worth it. She is so good in fact that she should have had more to do than the three other leads who are giving too much screen time in some parts or another.See it for Rachel Weisz and the rest of the cast but don't hold your hopes up for a movie as good as the book"
2,This Jury should be sequestered.,"Cliché ridden movie that can't make up it's mind whether it's a court room thriller or a sappy lesson in gun control that fine tuns its message to an irritating noise that does not stop. The actors are good (I agree with every body that Rachel Weisz and Gene Hackman make the movie better than it should have been) and there are some suspenseful scenes that do make you jump but the movie does not handle them with any clarity, or any purpose other than to hind the fact that story has too many plot holes to drive anyone who is watching it batty. Maybe the actors should have waited for a better script before they committed to this movie because it even shows on the expression on their faces that they even think this movie makes no sense."
2,Formulaic and Forgettable,"I would write a review, but I've already forgotten it. It has already blended together with all the other recent Hollywood movies of this type. I do remember a terrible performance by Dustin Hoffman. Oh, and a completely predictable ""twist"" at the end. You know how important that twist is to the formula.How much more of this crap can that town pump out?"
1,"Unbeleivably unrealistic, hard to sit through...","I couldn't watch this all the way thru straight. I had to stop it sever times and take a break from the boredom. 1st of all it is soooo farfetched. 2nd of all I think Hackman shows in this film that he's played one bad guy too many, by his lack of perfomrance, he needs to try some other role. Hackman's bad guy acting in this film would be more suitable in a James Bond film, petting a white can, while talking about taking over the world. In any case the lead guy is boring, and come on now hidden cameras set upo everywhere to select a jurer? And 20 people at evil Hackman's service night and day. This is so unbelievable, not even an artistic film. Don't waste your time. Only the 1st two minutes of the film is exciting, and it's downhill, the rest of the way. Omly for Hackman diehard fans who want to see him hige an uninspired performance, playing his millionth roll as an evil genious gone over the top."
2,Big Departure,A big departure from the book in an effort to push a political agenda and overlook personal responsibility. The film is only redeemed by the strong performances of the actors....
1,Would not allow a lower rating,It is too bad that Hollywood has to bastardize novels. The movie premise and the evidence does not make the level of baloney. Waste of time to watch. Boring.
1,"They tried too hard, but it's still a turn down","This wack movie tried too hard, John Cusack and Gene Hackman wasted their time in this noir thriller wannabe, they tried to make it confusing but switched it to the stupid level, my opinion is that this movie is really pointless, who the hell cares about a runaway jury, make another super hero movie or atleast a Tarzan remake, not this. Now public people's private lives are turning into movies, what next, a movie about a talking ant, oh wait that already happened. What has happened to movies, they'll make anything bad and the press will think it's some sort of a masterpiece. Can't wait till i direct and write my own movie."
2,"A renter, but nothing else.","I really didn't expect too much from this film. I heard things and right from the beggining those things were acknowledged. I don't see why they call the ending a ""twist"". It wasn't that much of a twist and you won't be surprised at all. You will probably be like, ""Big deal, who cares!"" The actors are good, but the material is weak. It is also kind of boring. In a boring kind of way. That's boring. I'm not being funny, this is a really boring movie at times."
1,terrible adaptation,"Having read the book, I can say that the book was much better than the movie. The movie changed the premise from Big Tobacco to Gun Control - which in my opinion completely changed the look and feel of the story.If you are interested in the story then I suggest the book or audio book - but in my opinion the movie is worthless. Both the story and acting within the movie are marginal at best. Hackman delivers a decent perfomance, but John Cusack delivers a subpar performance and is unbelievable in portraying his role as the maverick juror #9."
1,A real legal mess.,"Dumb and quite boring legal drama that only has the great acting of Rachel Weisz and Gene Hackman to make it tolerable to watch. Both Weisz and Hackman do wonders with a dumb and extremely predicable script that is not help by the directing, which is not up to par at all. The story of the original novel is push aside for a whining voice for gun control that makes not sense what so ever, and some of the scenes that occur in the film leads nowhere in terms of the story itself.If you see it, see it for the fine acting from Rachel Weisz and Gene Hackman but I recommend renting something from their other work than to sit though this."
3,"Movie OK, Book much better","I can not believe they didn't stick with the original plot of the book. Why change it to gun control rather than big tobacco? Whether it was a personal agenda or not, I'll never know. But it sure didn't play out very good compared to the book.The movie moves along nicely, and there are some quips about ""big tobacco"" as if to say, ""see we didn't totally go away from the book"". But overall, the movie was a disappointment. Nothing against the actors, the book was just plain better.The DVD features are completely minimalistic and I can't think of a single reason to purchase it.Ultimately, this is an OK rental, but I can't recommend it for a purchase."
3,A fine show that needed a better view.,"I did not get offended with the whole gun debate raised in this movie. I actually enjoyed the way it was handle in some respect, but the movie needed more of a kick to really grab me into it and needed to give a better platform to its actors. I love Gene Hackman as an actor, and I thought that he did well in his part, and Dustin Hoffman gave him a really good adversary. I liked Rachel Weisz a lot as an actress, and she really gave one heck of a performance. I think she actually stole the movie from everybody with what she did, that how good I think she was. And John Cusack was as cool as ever.I just wish that the movie were as good as their performances."
2,"The actors deserve better than this, as we all do.","Bleak film that rather sweep the subject of guns under the rug, and skirt the issues that are raised. Everything from the direction to the screenplay is not handled properly and the whole victims right issue is made to look like a joke. Gene Hackman, Rachel Weisz, and Dustin Hoffman do fine despite all of this and they each turn in great performances. Hackman is always great as the bad guy, while Weisz is spectacular as the woman who holds the jury in the palm of her hands and Hoffman is great as the attorney who is trying to find justice for his client. Each of them should have been nominate for academy awards but thanks to a week script, flat direction and a bias point of view, they are not served well by the movie they are in.Gene Hackman, Rachel Weisz, and Dustin Hoffman deserve better than what they had to work with, and hopefully, they could work together again in a much better movie, especially a better movie than this debacle."
4,Runaway Jury review,"This is a great movie and putting on blu-ray is a gigantic step up from the DVD format. John Cusak, Gene Hackman and Rachel Weiss are fantastic. I highly recommend the movie."
3,Lacks punch,"The movie is a good production, good acting and all but for some reason it lacks overall punch or appeal and once seen, it will probably end up just collecting dust. For me it's definitely not a movie that I'd be interested in watching again and I've seen a lot more interesting and better movies at my time."
4,John Grisham v. Hollywood,"I have not liked most of John Grisham's books, but a few have been made into good movies. I liked this movie much better than the book. The acting was fantastic and believable. Gene Hackman has such an ability to become his role. John Cusak is absolutely charming as he minipulates the jury."
1,"Despite Rachel Weisz and Gene Hackman, its still a cop out.","Give or take rendition of the book lacks the cautious commentary of tobacco and put a spin on the question of guns in our country. The setting is quite different as well and the reason of some of the characters don't go with the new story that was added. The acting is worth taking notice with Gene Hackman and Rachel Weisz giving this movie some credibility with their performances which bear in mind is better than the film itself, and Dustin Hoffman giving some weight to a character that was not in the book too much at all, which is fine because Hoffman is not in the movie too much as well. The script, which was reportedly rewritten several times, comes up short in the dramatic department, and the pace of the film lacks a steady tempo when it cuts from scene to scene. It's a well made movie but it just does not hold up as a very good one."
3,Gary Felder submits another amazingly lackluster film,"Well known actors John Cusack, Gene Hackman and Dustin Hoffman along with a handful of others that have made a good showing in other films bring up the cast list along with what seemed a fairly decent budget. Based on the John Grisham book ""The Runaway Jury"", the adaptation to film seems to have twisted the original book storyline of Anti-Tobacco People Vs. Big Tobacco Industry into Anti-Gun People Vs. Big Gun Industry.I could lie and try and boost this thing but I just cant bring myself to give it 5 stars. I'm a huge fan of John Cusack especially in High Fidelity and Pushing Tin as well as Hackman and Hoffman in countless other films like Unforigiven and Rainman so I had to give this one a peek."
3,Grisham book made into a political movement for Gun Control,"I read Runaway Jury a few years back at college and I enjoyed it. Unfortunately the movie does not follow the book, and it seems like it was made more to bash gun manufactures than to tell a real story. The acting is pretty good here and that's the only plus. Gene Hackman never disappoints in his role, and Rachel Weisz is just as good as his adversary in and out of the courtroom. Dustin Hoffman is fine, but not as promenade as Hackman, and John Cusack is fine as a juror who is in league with Weisz. The book was so much better than the movie, and that could have been a better movie than this."
2,Despite the good performances the movie is not that good.,"One sided court thriller that attempts to entertain but lacks the necessary ingredients to be successful. The screenplay is a joke on so many levels that it's an eye sour and certain scenes really isn't necessary to the plot of the film. The acting on the other hand is very good with Gene Hackman and Rachel Weisz doing their best work and making this film much more that it deserved to be, which is a shame because both of them deserve a much better movie than this. Dustin Hoffman is fine is a relatively small role and John Cusack is decent as well. The movie begins to unravel when it stars to preach its values other than to give compelling arguments for them and loses its way during the course of the film. It could have been more but with a script that needs a lot of work, it's a hard thing to come by."
2,The strong performance of Rachel Weisz is the only plus here,"Derivative thriller that not only does not stay close to the book but also lacks the insight to give a better show. The script has too many problems and the pacing starts and stalls at will in the most starling of moments. The acting is fine with Rachel Weisz stealing the show and doing better than she should have consitering the script is flat and Gene Hackman doing his best work in years. The whole espionage aspect to the film just does not work, and in reality, the case would have been throng out of a real court. The acting is the only plus in this film and that is a miracle because the rest of the film just does not work.Thanks to Rachel Weisz and Gene Hackman, the movie is just ok but if it had a decent script, it could have been better."
2,"Weisz, Hackman and Hoffman are great but the film is not.","Lackluster adaptation to the John Grisham novel has only the acting to save it for total disaster with great performances by Rachel Weisz, Gene Hackman, and Dustin Hoffman but they are working from a half baked script that in essence does not know what it wants to be and direction that is marginal at best. The tobacco story is gutted for a pure and simple look at gun violence, and the setting of New Orleans is not the original setting of the book.If you want to see this movie, the acting more than makes up for the problems it has, but not by much."
2,John Grisham should keep his books to himself.,"Very bad rendition of his best-selling book lacks Grisham's real voice of legal ethics and tight plot point in order to cry about the gun argument to an annoying tee. The screenplay feels like a summery than a story, and the direction needed more to it for me to feel compelled to sit though the movie. I feel sorry for all the actors involved for giving their all for this lackluster of a movie. I will also give special notice to Gene Hackman and Rachel Weisz for giving outstanding performances in a movie that really did not deserve it, and to Dustin Hoffman, who took a bit part and made something special out of it. Despite their efforts,the movie remains a good reason for authors to not sell their works to filmmakers because they will butcher it for their own views. ."
3,It&#65533;s ok but it could have been better.,"Decent but overlong film that has its heart in the right place but tries to be more than it should have. If it just stuck to a simple story, it would have worked better but to add the whole Spy Vs Spy routine makes this movie a bit hard to grasps while it's trying to tell a real story about gun violence. Gene Hackman does make all this plausible, and to his credit, this movie works. Big credit also goes to Rachel Weisz, who not only helps Hackman in keeping this movie grounded in a bit of reality but gives this film its heart and soul, a hard thing to do when most of everything you see here feels very artificial. John Cusack does a great job as well as Dustin Hoffman who is a real treat to see.I just wish that the movie could have been more grounded in reality than it was."
3,Fair Grisham Adaptation that needed more work,"This is a Fair John Grisham Adaptation, and it's better than the earlier adaptation of his previous books (The Client, The Chamber, and Pelican Brief) But while does hold as a good adaptation, it is the least faithful of them all. The Tobacco Argument that was the main highlight of the book is replace with a gun control argument that really does not fit with the tapestry of the story. It's a good argument but it needed more of an angle for it to really work. The acting is top notch with Gene Hackman chewing up the scenery as a crooked jury consultant, Rachel Weisz as a mysterious woman trying to sell the verdict , John Cusack as a juror with a secret and Dustin Hoffman rounds out the great cast as a southern Lawyer who is trying to get justice for a murdered office worker. All the performances are really good, but it's too bad the screenplay that was written by four people, did not meet their talent."
4,Good Story,Good story and great performances along with the New Orelans backdrop. Gene Hackman and Dustin Hoffman are always good. John Cusack is likeable as always and Rachel Wiesz is engaging in her role.
3,Fine for what it tries to do but don&#65533;t look for any meaning,"Well intended but vapid lesson in guns lacks the heart of its conviction and resorts to cheap theatrics in order to try to sell its message. The setting is nice for this movie but the direction does not do it justice, and the script falls apart midway into the story. Gene Hackman, Rachel Weisz, and company all do great jobs with what is giving but they can't save this movie from itself."
2,Artistic license run amuck,"Took a perfectly good novel and perverted the story line so it barely resembles the orginal. Can not recommend it in good conscience. Stick with the book or try another movie selection,"
4,Good thriller,"Great John Grisham thriller that manages to hold itself up with some dignity with a great cast (Rachel Weisz, Gene Hackman, Dustin Hoffman, and John Cusack) and great nail biting suspends. Even with the fact that it really does not follow the book, the movie does hold itself well as one of the better John Grisham movies."
2,Rachel Weisz and Gene Hackman are superb but the film is not,"Decent by very flawed movie that is made much better thanks in apart to the superb performances of Rachel Weisz and Gene Hackman. Their performances are the heart and soul of this film. Too bad the movie itself does not come close to their professionalism because I can safely say that film is a huge mess from beginning to end. Plot points go no where with no explanation what so ever, and the story itself does not hold a candle to the original plot of the book. If you decide to see it, See it for Weisz and Hackman's great performances but don't expect a movie of their caliber."
2,"Wasted of Time Because of the story, not the cast.","Bad and incoherent John Grisham rip off than kills the senses with its bad and righteous view of guns in America. The acting is good with Rachel Weisz and Gene Hackman stealing the show from the rest of the cast with great and special nods going to Dustin Hoffman, and John Cusack. No much of a movie here but because of Weisz, Hackman and the rest of the cast, it's passable."
3,Save by the acting.,"Dimwitted court room spectacle that hold no creditability in the passage of law but has a great cast that does wonders with almost nothing to back them up with. Gene Hackman and Dustin Hoffman are master actors, and master actors are great in anything, and throw in the great and versatile Rachel Weisz in the mixed, and we have a movie worth seeing. It's bad for them though because they are basically working without a net in terms of plot development, and structure but they are game. Maybe they can pull together in another movie someday that really gives them something to work with."
2,Run Away from this Dismal Movie,"This film squanders the considerable talents of several A-list actors with an unbelievable plot and a predictable and moralizing ending.It's not that I disagree with the theme - I'm no fan of guns - but the concept of the film is simply ludicrous. I won't give away any details, but suffice it to say that this film thinks that conspiracy - no matter how silly, and twists - no matter how nonsensical, will somehow add up to an engaging court drama.The original script must have been pretty good for these distinguished actors to sign on to the project. I guess someone ran away with that version, because the final product is terrible."
4,I liked It a lot,"I thought the movie was pretty good. I didn't expect too much from it because of the ""typical revenge movie"" tag that seemed to be hanging over it. However, Cusack continues to do an outstanding job as of late. I like the movie just because I'm not a 100% supporter of the gun industry anyway. We all can dream a little of one day someone holding the actual gun companies personally responsible for their guns, what they can do, and who uses them. Honestly, who the hell needs an automatic machine gun to shoot a rabbit? Good movie."
4,A good suspence movie,"I enjoyed this movie. It had a lot of plot twist and turns. I kept wondering if the John Cusack character was a hero or a villian. It keeps the viewer guessing until the end.This is also a movie that makes you think. My friends and I got into a long discusssion about this movie. The question is ""What are the possibilities of what happened in the movie to happen in real life?"""
1,Anti-gun propoganda,This movie is utter nonsense done by leftist actors who hate the 2nd ammendment more than the people who actually kill people. Don't waste your time by watching this or any other left wing nonsense.
1,This movie is a farce.,"One of the worst movies I've seen in years. The plot tenets were so ridiculous I couldn't believe it. I find it ludicrous to purport that major companies would be knowing consipirators in jury tampering. The backlash that would occur should they be found out would be far worse than losing just money. The movie tries to be a morality play against the ""evil companies"" but falls extremely short. It appears to be a movie bought and paid for by the anti-gun factions. And their arrogance about the mentality of the viewing audiences belies their narrowmindedness."
