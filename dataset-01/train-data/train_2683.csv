2,poor quality motor,"The motor died suddenly during use. I was cleaning up a pile of very dry leaves and the motor just quit after about 3 minutes. I thought the power to the house had gone out. I then waited to see if the motor had somehow overheated and would recover but, nope, didn't happen. It has only been used about 8 times since I purchased it last year. I was happy with the performance when it worked but I expected to be able to use it for more than a year. If you do purchase this item I would definitely advise you to buy the adapter so you can mulch leaves directly into a trash can. The bag that comes with the vac/blower fills quickly."
1,This Leaf Hog Sucks!,"First use the bag kept popping-off blowing dirt all over me. By the third use the plastic tabs that hold the bag failed, had to drill holes to secure bag with bolts & wing nuts. Finally by the end of the season the bag itself failed. It is made of a plastic material that wore causing a hole for the mulched leafs to blow out. I will never buy another unless B&D address these issues! I need a new leaf vac and will be looking at Toro models."
1,Up in a cloud of smoke,Yet one more Black and Decker BV4000 with melted outlet prongs. Opened it up and it's all melted.Ruined a really good extension cord as well as itself.I'm very disappointed.
1,Substandard Performance,"I purchased this product to clean the oak leaves out of my flower beds which have decorative rock, not cypress mulch. I had cleaned the majority of the leaves out by hand, but wanted to use this product to gather up the hard-to-get leaves that remained. I thought this product would easily be able to vacuum the leaves out, however within 10 minutes it was overheating. I turned it off and let it cool down, attributing the burning smell to newness, however after turning it back on and starting the process again, the motor totally burned out within 20 minutes. It didn't even vaccuum up enough leaves to fill up the leaf bag. I'm hopeful I can get my money back!"
1,My review.,I ordered the Black and Decker Leaf Hog 12 for a Christmas present for my husband. He plugged it in to use it for the first time this week end and it burned up while blowing leaves off the car port so I would say it is not a good product. I thought Black and Decker was a better product than this.
5,This is a fusion classic.,"All must boiw to the guitar of Larry Coryell and his 70's band Elevth House. This is ensemble action at its highest with Coryell's incredibly fast unison lines with trumpeter Randy Brecker, Mike Mandel's slightly dated keyboard sound, yet you can tell the talent is there and Alphonse Mouzon's dramatic speedy playing and also when playing with bassist Danny Trifan. A great rhythm section. If you find this you must buy it.Kirk Mueller"
1,What film?,This has been a film I have enjoyed since my distant childhood. Imagine my great dissapointment when all I received from Amazon was a factory sealed empty container. No disc. This review is not rated for the film but for the manufacturer. I had to re-order from a different manufacturer and can now enjoy this film.
5,Fantastic introduction to classic Irish Music,"We've owned this CD for years and have enjoyed the music on it practically as a household background theme. Recently it was lost, and so we had to replace it asap. Great that it was still available!!"
2,"Weird problem, zero support","I am helping a family member use this program. I have come up against a bug--the program is mis-identifying data files as having come from an older version of Legacy, making it impossible to open them. Considering the amount of work that has gone into these files, this is a very bad thing. The company refers users to the website, but there is no phone number available anywhere on the site, the FAQs are useless, and some of the tech help seems to be adversing (e.g., sign up for an email list).Not providing a phone number for people who have invested time and money in a company's software seems a particularly slimy and stupid thing to do."
5,Great Kids' Movie,"This DVD is a great choice if you are looking for something fun and educational for your children. One of the best features is the different types of audio you can listen to while you watch, each geared toward a different age-group. Thanks to ""younger kids"", ""older kids"" and ""adults"" narration, everyone and anyone can enjoy learning about and watching these pandas. If you want to see some cute and amazing pandas, this is the DVD for you! The sing-along songs are also really fun :)"
3,Cute but not educational,"This film lets you feel as if you were physically in the panda zoo watching their every move closely. For me, I was looking for something that is educational with a ""story line."" This film is really more about how the pandas live their lives in captivity in China. They're happy and cute, but I just didn't learn anything from it."
2,The art of crushing triscuits to extract their essence,"From ANGEL WITH A BROKEN WANG by Emil Cioran: ""The North's aspiration toward a different sky has engendered German music--geometry of autumns, alcohol of concepts, metaphysical intoxication. 19th-century Italy--that bazaar of sounds--lacked the dimension of night, the art of crushing shadows to extract their essence. One must side with Brahms or with the sun.""Yeah, well--whatever, Emil. But whatever you do, don't expect much from music which is tailored to fit pre-written words. (Instead of the other way around.) Because the inevitable result is the submediocrity on display here. The only 2 things I like are CAN YOU LEND ME 20 QUID and the shoop-doo-wah coda of THE CONSTANT LOVER."
4,A Great Collection of Historic Basses,"As a developing singer and lover of bass arias, I have enjoyed this great collection of historic bass recordings. It is a fantastic opportunity to hear some of the greatest opera basses of the 20th century in some rare and hard to find recordings. Since many of these recordings are from the early part of that century (I think the most contempory of the basses is Ezio Pinza who died, I beleive in the 1950s), the sound qulaity may be lacking at times for our modern tastes. The performaces, howver, are well worth it. There are some real gems on this cd and a must for any affecianato of the operatic bass repretoire."
1,Do not buy this item,These batteries do not work. As soon as I switch my Canon S100 to picture taking mode the camera automatically shuts off. I bought 3 of them and they all do the same thing. Must be some strange non-OEM compatibility issue - be warned
5,Another Timoshenko Production,Timoshenko = Mechanics God. This book is the backbone for plate and shell analysis.
5,Amazing Quality,This men's ID bracelet is a very high quality sterling silver and looks absolutely wonderful. I had it engraved by a local jeweler; it came out great. I am completely pleased with this item and couldn't ask for anything better. It made an impressive gift.
5,daughters review,My daughter got this as a reward and she loved it. The mare was a deep red. The foal was soo cute she said. One problem with this toy it can break very easily. I reccomend this for 7 and up.
3,My Last Palm,"I've had Palms for years, mostly for sync with Outlook calendar and contacts. Versamail is so useless and poorly supported that I stopped sync with E-mail on my T3. Compared to my old T3 and Vx models, the Z22 is far too slow. It has to pause to display each Grafitti (input) character! There has been no meaningful software or OS development in the last 5 - 10 years. Forget Palm, get a little netbook."
4,Palm Z22,I am very pleased with my purchase of the Palm Z22.I had an old Sharp YO-370 that I had used to keep my various passwords and internet accounts organized. The Z22 does this and much more. It is the best bargain out there at this time to provide help with everyday organization tasks.
1,Got Vista Don't bother!,"Nice unit, small and compact.But....this thing does NOT seem to like Windows Vista.Will not download the photo software from the CD. Palm Customer Service is less than helpful.May have to return this junk and get something that actually works as advertised."
4,That&#65533;s what Friends are for,"THE PLEASURE OF HIS COMPANY is the debut novel from Angela Henry. It is a captivating mystery that tells the story of Kendra Clayton's search for the truth concerning the murder of her best friend's boyfriend. In this quest for the truth reveals that the deceased was a ladies' man. Kendra is implicated in the police investigation, so she is determined to uncover the killer herself. Be prepared for the Twist Ending!Henry has done a good job introducing Kendra Clayton to the literary scene. The book is well developed and keeps the reader perplexed until the ending. I look forward to the next installment of a Kendra Clayton mystery.Reviewed by Robilyn HeathThe RAWSISTAZ Reviewers"
4,Kendra Clayton mystery is a hit!,"How do I describe a good book? One I can't put down. And ""The Pleasure of His Company"" was one book I could not stop reading! The characters are beyond believable--they're people you know from your own home town. The story was extremely well written and intriguing, and Angela's vivid descriptive detail left me with plenty of time to concentrate on the plot. I'm normally not a mystery fan, but this book makes me want to reconsider. Highly recommended."
2,Cuff Links,I purchased the cuff links as Christmas gift. I was disappointed with the original product. They looked liked $9.99 cuff links in real life versus the $50 I spent. My suggestion is to pick out jewelry in person and don't rely on a picture.
2,very flimsy!,I bought these as a gift for my hubby and i was so embarrassed when i received them that i decided not to give it to him. I gave it away to charity thinking that someone in need could get use out of it. They looked so clean and sleek in the photo. I figured I couldn't go wrong with this purchase but boy was I surprised. Some people may not mind this quality. My dad thought that it wasn't too bad but I personally was a displeased.
2,I have not read this book yet,i just want you to know that i have not read this book yet once i do i will review at a later date.
4,Something different,"If you are tired of the conventional sweet nutcrackers this is the nutcracker for you. It's edgy, funny, very well danced and not your mother's Nutcracker."
1,NOT FOR KIDS!,"I preface this review with warning that I am coming from a conservative Christian viewpoint, allbeit, one who loves Tim Burton and things alike, so after reading the other reviews, this dancer and instructor bought this video with great expectations! Objections--the party scene shows couples dancing lewdly, one in particular doing what my son calls ""humping."" Also, Mark himself explains how there are male snowflakes and in the waltz of the flowers--no problem--until we see them dancing in tutus like the women! Nothing like chest hair coming out of a tutu bodice! Marie's Mom is suspiciously a guy in drag as well. Too adult and morally compromised for my standards. There are also a lot of dead moments where nothing is happening on stage, just the music playing, and very boring. Not for kids, not for adults either in my opinion. Great ideas gone astray...so dissapointing!"
4,"The answer IS blowing in ""The Wind""","The song that launched a thousand trips, ""The Wind,"" the Bob Bruno tour de force on this self titled release from August of 1967. Yeah, Jerry Jeff is here-writing four of the 11 songs. You can hear a touch of where he would be in just a year with his first solo album. Long time Jerry Jeff friend and fair writer in his own right, Gary White, is on bass. Bob Bruno is more evident. Vanguard was known for choosing the more eclectic bands in the 60's. Circus Maximus fits the mold. Nothing outstanding other than ""The Wind,"" but some interesting moments like ""Chess Game"" and Jerry Jeff's ""Fading Lady."" Definitely worth checking out."
4,"almost everything but ""Wind"" is great","Please ignore several of the other reviewers if you love real rock'n'roll (as opposed to jazzy or folky snoozers). This debut Circus Maximus album is chock full of both jangly but frenetic folk-rock and killer, fuzzed-out garage punk (""Rest of My Life to Go"", ""Bright Light Lover""), making it Jerry Jeff Walker's finest hour. In marked contrast, the interminable ""Wind"" surely ranks as one of the two worst songs."
2,Sweet jesus this book is disturbing,"Alas, I must be the voice of dissent amongst these unfathomably glowing reviews.Simply put, 'The Lonesome Pine' is a disturbing tale of rejection. Honestly, I was half expecting the poor tree to end up as toilet paper in the end, wiping someone's you-know-what and being flushed down the toilet. My daughter is inexplicably going through a phase of enjoying this book, which I hope ends soon. The messages contained in it- especially that of body image and seeking approval from others for validation- are not only improper but downright dangerous.Amateurish, unmemorable illustrations. Go buy a classic from Arnold Lobel instead.But hey, it's shaped like a triangle! Catchy!Buyer beware."
2,One Big Opinion,Found this to be very opinionated and filled with doomsday advice. You would do better going to your undergrad school's pre-law advisor and asking them to connect you with alumni who are either finishing their 1L or who have graduated from law school.Read it for a thorough understanding of LSATs and applications to graduating and getting a job but don't let it be your only source of information. And you would do better to just borrow it from your library and save your money for text books. You'll need it.
3,Not for everyone,"This book is a good source of information if you are overly concerned with where you will be employed after law school. If you are intent on simply becoming an attorney, then this book is still useful, albeit in a different way.If you identify in the former category, this book will give you good information about how to be first in your class, get the ""right"" internships, and how to best go about securing the best jobs following graduation.If you are the type of person more concerned with learning the law and wanting to get a good idea of what to expect, and what to focus on while attending law school, then this book is also a good source."
5,A great place to start for prospective law students,"This book covers all the bases, advising how and when to undertake each portion of the law school admissions process. It has interesting bits of advice from recent graduates of first tier schools, and also offers a good honest look at what law school will really be like once you get in. Best of all, though, is the way it slows readers down and guides them through the important questions they need to ask themselves in order to know if they ought to apply to law school."
4,Compelling,"I've only read the first few chapters because they're the only ones that apply to me so far. So far the advice is sound, there seems to be a lot of input from various people who have graduated from some of the top schools in the country. The writing is compelling and speaks directly to the reader in an informal manner. Probably a good guide to help someone wrap their head around the entire experience."
1,Not useful for learning how to study,"This book came highly recommended from a friend at a major law firm. I found it lacking. You can get all of this advice on your own just by talking to friends in the legal profession. Given that I was changing fields entirely, I wanted tips on how to study effectively and how to take exams. ""Getting to Maybe"" is far better for what I was looking for than this book. I sold it back to Amazon used after my first year."
4,Satisfied,"Great book, good condition. The status of my order was never updated so even though my book arrived in a decent amount of time, I thought the order was still being processed."
4,Really Helpful,"I found this book easy to read and digest and organized well, with lots of helpful information. It's definitely a worthwhile buy for anyone considering or planning to go to law school."
1,Big Book of LIES,"This book is a fraudulent attempt to make law school seem like a good economic investment for your future. In fact- it's not. Approximately 90% of practicing lawyers hate their jobs and regret ever going to law school. Most people go to law school because they think they will make a lot of money. WRONG. The majority of lawyers only make an accountant's salary. If you enjoy tedious and pointless work with no potential for growth then become a lawyer. Otherwise, go to business school and get your M.B.A.."
4,Excellent book to read before starting 1L,"This book provides a general perspective of the law school experience and gives advice from recent law school graduates. Although I still have a few months to go before starting 1L, I can tell that this book's material will come in handy during my time in law school. ""Law School Confidential"" is definitely a worthy read the summer before your first semester!"
5,"Excellent advice, and very well written","I've read this book cover-to-cover twice as I prepare for law school. I've found the information practical and easy to follow. I wasn't sure how well the advice would transfer to actual use, but a couple of weeks ago I attended an open house at the local (NOT Top 20) law school, and was pleased to see one of the 2L's on the question-and-answer panel hold this book up and suggest that we all buy it. She said it was the most helpful thing she had read to prepare her for the law school experience."
2,Not that useful,"I bought this book over Thanksgiving break my first semester of law school. The book really scared me, saying you're basically sunk without doing outlines all semester long. I think the book overstates the case, and can create even more stress for 1L's. Some of the advise, such as not reading in order to catch up on outlining, is, counterproductive, and, I believe, almost irresponsible. Most exams emphasized what was taught near the end of the semester. In short, this book is good to give a general overview of the law-school culture, but I think its advice should be taken with a grain of salt."
5,Excellent Insight,"I will be a future 1L in August 2006. I have read a few different pre-law school books and I believe this is the best one by far. It talks about everything from beginning the process of applying to interviewing and getting a job. It really gets you in the right mindset that you need to be in and makes you ask yourself if this profession is for you. It gives study guidelines, test guidelines, information on summer associates and even more. I definitely reccommend this to anyone about start law school or contemplating law school. I also reccommend giving it to any close loved ones so that they will understand the what you're going through."
3,"Useful, but limited","Lots of great information and useful advice, to be sure. However, reading this book one gets the impression that the only road to success is going to a top 20 school and working for a large firm. Written for overachievers who've been gunning for the Ivy League since kindergarten."
1,Do NOT DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK,"This book scared me to death before I went to law school. I almost didn't go because of how horrible it made law school sound. Law school is tough and you work hard, but this book makes it sound like hell and it's more like purgatory. Don't buy it, don't read it, just keep going."
2,Pretentious.,"In my opinion, not worh buying unless you're too lazy to read basic information off the internet. Most of what this book says is common sense for every prelaw student, written in a glossy and sometimes smart alec manner. Yes, if you want to know basic facts like the whole proccess of getting into law school, LNATs, types of law studied, law firms and clerkships etc. get the book, but you can really get these information from about anywhere else.If you want something more useful try The Complete Law School Companion by Jeff Deaver instead (the other pre law book I picked up). It's not as nicely packaged as Law School Confidential of course but really, you don't need flowery words and grandiose themes. The Jeff Deaver book is less pretentious and much more practical."
2,Not very helpful,"I've read several of these books now, including The Law School Insider (which is MUCH better) and Acing Your First Year of Law School. The main problem I had with Law School Confidential is that its advice is not particularly realistic. He advises a rigid daily schedule, and a color-coding scheme for studying, among other things. While those may be useful for some people, I can't work that way, and I've never known any one who actually did. (And I was a PhD student in Computer Science.)His point of view seems geared towards getting good grades and beating the competition, but not towards learning. As a graduate student, I saw many people with that attitude, and they were rarely the best students. Overally, I found the book to be immature, and way too cynical."
3,This Book is for the Young Kids,"I read this book, and I think it is helpful, but only for a certain kind of student. I am a working professional going to law school at night, and I clearly saw that this book is geared towards day students who are attending law school straight out of college. If that describes you, then give it a read. If not, you're wasting your time and money with this book."
4,For those that want to suceed in law school,"I bought this book the summer before I started law school. The advice is invaluable, really gave me the motivation I needed. And although some of the tips are crazy (the color-coding, etc.), this book is a great start and a nice practical counterpoint to Scott Turow's ""1L"". I ended up acing my first year, making law review and working at a law firm. Can't say the book made all of this happen, but it definitely put me in the mindset to succeed, and some of the tips were pretty good (like setting up a command center for studying, mapping out your typical 1L day, tips on when to start the job hunt)."
5,Beacon in the darkness,"Law School Confidential is a must read for anyone considering law school. It's very helpful when you get there, too. The book is a beacon in the darkness of the first days of class. I consult it on a regular basis."
3,Skip it,"I am a student at a top 5 law school. I will be commenting on the law school portion of the book (not the ""get into law school"" portion).I was not very impressed with this book. The author does not suggest anything new or helpful. ""Make flow charts, make outlines (the shorter the better)."" This stuff is nothing new. You will learn this within one week at law school. The author's big technique, ""book briefing,"" is a tool to avoid being embarrassed when called on in class. This is a waste of time. Class performance has nothing to do with your grade. Thus, worrying about class performance is a waste of time. The sooner you accept this fact and become willing to say ""I don't know"" in class in return for having more time to study what might be tested, the better you will do.The best pre-1L book is Planet Law School (which itself is far from perfect). Skip this one. Your money will be better spent on a commercial outline."
5,Must Read for Potential Law Students,"I will be beginning my fist year of law school this fall and I am happy to report that reading Law School Confidential has greatly reduced my anxiety about the upcoming year. Robert Miller and his group of mentors thoughtfully lay out all of the pit falls, both socially and academically, that law students typically fall prey to. The books observations are very insightful and I can see how they will help me immensly this fall. I highly recommend this book to anyone considering law school."
4,Excellent but $$ off.,"I agree with all the reviews and found the book to be worth its weight in gold. The only errors I found were in his quotes of what things cost, e.g., LSAT Prep Courses. For a book only two years old the courses have more than doubled from the prices he gives. Yes things change with time but surprised that they were that much different.If you are considering law school or are in law school this book should be in your possession 24 hours a day."
5,Best I found,"I'm a second-year law student, and this is the best comprehensive law school book I found. Since Miller is a fairly recent law school grad, the advice and topics aren't as antiquated as I found in other books. I used the recommended highlighter case-briefing method, and it served me well."
5,Good Resource - definitely recommended,"I'm in my first year and I can honestly say that all the advice in this book seems to be right on - there may be a few things that work for some and not for others - book-briefing, for example, doesn't work so well for me, but all the other advice seems sound. Read this instead of One L or Paper Chase."
4,A helpfull tool,"If you have been accepted or are thinking of attending law school, then you will want to read this book. It is a great tool to surviving law school. This book is just chock full of tips and advice that is truly helpfull. My personal favorite is how to break down a reading to the important points. The Book is also explained in very easy to read words, which is nice on such a tough subject as law school. The authors give nice advice about surviving the work load as well as the pitfalls of law school personalities. This is down to earth advice on problems such as falling behind in the work to finding a job. Just remember, this is a tool and not the panacea to success. It is the authors experiences that help write this book and you have to figure your own path by using their advice. It is worth the price and is very helpfull. Good luck."
2,"Good, If you plan on going to Harvard","Admittedly, I have not started law school yet, but I don't plan on going to Harvard or Yale or any big time school. This book only gives advice about those schools. Some of the stuff is very useful though, study tips and such. And a section in the choosing a law school chapeter called ""The Harsh Reality"" proves the private school bias that our country seems to have adopted. This section basically tells you that if you don't get into one of the top 20 schools you should take the LSAT again and reapply. And he also says that taking an acceptance from a ""regional school"" is a risky situation. All in all it's a pretty good book if you are going to Harvard, Yale, UPenn, or Georgetown."
5,READ THIS if you are planning on law school,This is the best book about law school I have ever read!!! I only wish I had picked it up sooner. It begins with a section of questions to make sure you want to go to law school and ends with passing the bar. It is the comprehensive bible of law students!
5,Perfect entry-point for unde understanding network storage,"Some authors write in a style that demonstrates their technical mastery at the expense of reader comprehension. By contrast, some modern technical books talk down to their readers in a silly way. This book is like baby bear's porridge, just right. Not too hot, not too cold. Begining with the first enterprise storage technologies, the authors explain where we are today, how we got here and where we are going. Storage concepts are broken down piece by piece and presented in a concise, understandable way. I couldn't recommend this book more highly."
1,"It is Ok, but sometime the fuse breaks down","Works well for europeanlow energy equipment, like braun tooth brush, batterie charger etc.If you exegerate the power, there is still a small fuse that rescues the convert.Sometimes a bit lowGood value for money."
3,ok,I thought this was ok. The only thing I did not like it that the scenes repeat themselves. My 6 month old daughter was not into it at all.
5,THE BEST DIAPER RASH CREAM FOR BABYS!!!!,"i used DESITIN but every aplication i don't like this cream on my fingers!! i changed to AVEENO the first 2 weeks and inside of my home fine!!but... when i put it in my diaper bag to go the cream change the consistency like liquid.I decide buy Huggies rash cream to my 3 month old Baby sensitive skin, now he's 11 months old and still are using Huggies Rash Cream and inside or outside, cold or hot keep the same consistency and just i need little portion to every aplication."
3,Does not work correctly sometimes,"I have used bounceback express (6.12) for several years.It came with my seagate usb disk.Fairly easy to set up.You can pick specific directories and exclusions lists.I have happy till I recently noticed that some of my exclusion lists work while others do not.Based on this bug, I am wondering if it is correctly backing all the filesthat have changed.I am going to look for something else.A backup software that mostly works is not very useful."
1,DO NOT TRUST YOUR BACKUP TO CMS PRODUCTS,"I have backed up my laptop every 60 minutes as Bounceback is set as its default. I always felt quite secure in knowing that the backup would protect me in case of a catastrophic failure. Well, I had a massive failure, retored my hard drive and I had so many errors, nothing would work properly...nothing. This software also does not work with any registry cleaners such as System Mechanic which they don't tell you. I had to buy a startup disk so I could restore and it still didn't work. I had to start over rebuilding from scratch my laptop. I have tossed the CMS product in the dumpster, I just couldn't sell it to anyone. IT IS NOT RELIABLE."
2,Be very careful,If you buy any products by CMS Make sure you order exactly what you want. I mistakenly purchased Bounce back essential instead of Bounce back express. I've been trying to get them to give me an exchange by contacting them by phone and email and have been totally ignored. DO NOT plan on getting any support from them if you need it. It looks like I'm out $30 and will have to spend another $30 to get what I want.
1,Beware--item description is incorrect!,"This item is 17.5"", NOT 18"" (a critical difference for most planters). Also it is a single tray, NOT a six-pack as the description implies. Also note that ""clay"" refers to the color, not the material--the material is plastic."
1,Have other Heath-Zenith Motion Detector Lights,"I am on my third Heath Zenith Motion detector light for above our garage and now this one has failed like the other two. I would stay away from this company. My first one was halogen and you could not find the right replacement bulb. When it failed, I sent it back under warranty. I sent them a white one and they send back a brown one. The brown one lasted about a year. I switched to a flood light model, and it now failed after a couple of years."
5,Works great,Product works great.. installed in minutes.. has different sensitivity settings to adjust as needed.. Have no complaints..
1,Unsure what to think right now...,"Installed last week. Worked for less than one week. I'm going to double check everything tomorrow and re-evaluate if necessary. Right now this product doesn't deserve the one star that I'm giving it. No work, no rating."
1,??? what was this???,"::shakes head:: my god, what was anyone involved in this book thinking . . .::shakes head::"
3,Maybe If It Had Been Framed Better,"I think its significant that this was the only PDQ Bach album which didn't include any sort of framing sequence -- that is to say, there were no intros or outros to any of the pieces, which put the work into any sort of a context, humorous or otherwise. As such, I found it to be a very confusing album. Add to this, the fact that the humor of some of these pieces relies on a visual component which, oddly enough, doesn't really translate well on a CD. As such, I think this is just about the worst PDQ Bach album of the bunch. Of course, Peter Shickelie is a great composer, and so even the bad stuff is worth listening to, just don't expect the belly-laughs you might ""Oedipus Tex"" or ""The 1712 Overture."" Its only for hard-core fans, or music afficianods who can catch the frequently subtle musical jokes in the purely orchestral pieces."
4,"push the wheel, learn to count!",This is a really cute board book-- bright stylized drawings of many kinds of animals. When you pull the wheel tab the correct number rises to the top of the book (ex: 5 baby ducks).Very nice tactile/action fun for kids.
4,Great Cable... Great Price,Yep... perfect... no complaints.... except for maybe the color... but it's behind my tv... so who cares.
1,hdmi,"i used it on my ps3 and sony bravia, it didnt work well i have to return it and it was too short."
1,hdmi cable without brand name,"We got the hdmi cables, but we are not sure whether it is the same as the ones on the website. The cables come without any packaging, and there is no indication anywhere that they are the same brand name items advertised on the website.We have not yet used the cables yet, and we're not sure whether they will work or not."
4,Panasonic HDMI cable,"I bought one of these cables sometime back and it worked great. Bought some more HDMI cable equipment and bought two more of the Panasonic HDMI cables for that equipment. I never looked back. Please belive me, save your money and do NOT buy Monster cables. I had tryed Monster, and took the HDMI cable back for credit and bought these on Amazon."
5,Good cable at the right price,"I am very happy with the signal provided by this HDMI cable. I am using two of these cables, one for a HD DVR unit and one for a playstation 3. My only advice to a cable buyer would be to overestimate the length of cable you need. I wound up with some tight connections, because I misjudged the distance I would need to travel. Overall very happy with the cable and did not feel I overpaid for these."
5,Don't spend the big bucks,"I just purchased a 40"" LCD flat screen TV and this Panasonic cableI can not see any reason to spend the big bucks of a Monster cable if this cable was not up to par Panasonic would not put there name on it since they produce TV's that accept HDMI cables. If you purchased a Panasonic TV with a Panasonic cable and the cable was of poor quality the TV would not play well and you could blame the TV and I am sure they would not want that."
5,"Good, accessible history","This is a very good book. Green is an excellent writer, and a knowledgeable historian. I read Herodotus, not too long ago (Herodotus: The History)- even supplemented it with the Howe & Wells commentary (A Commentary on Herodotus: With Introduction and Appendices Volume I (Books I-IV) (Commentary on Herodotus, Bks. 1-4) &A Commentary on Herodotus: With Introduction and Appendixes Volume 2 (Books V-IX)). I enjoyed Herodotus greatly, but a contemporary historian, who understands the world view of a modern reader, can make the material much more comprehensible. Green's history is well worth reading."
4,An Interesting Look At This Time Period!,Mr. Green has taken a very interesting look at a subject that occured long ago. He has managed to cover this military conflict and do so in such a way that it's informative but at the same time will hold the reader's interest.This is a very indepth analysis of this conflict and nothing is left out. The reader will have a full understanding of all of the different aspects. When necessary Mr. Green explains his feelings on Herodotus' comments and observations.This is an interesting look at a conflict that took place centuries ago. Whether you are reading for pleasure or this is a text for a class you will come away with a better understanding of this military conflict.
2,MEDIORCE RESEARCH WITH LITTLE NEW INSIGHT.,THE BOOK BREAKS NO NEW GROUND. HERODETUS HAS A MORE OBJECTIVE VIEW OF THE ACHAEMENIDS THAN PETER GREEN DOES. THIS BOOK IS EURO-PAROCHIAL IN OUTLOOK... VERY DISPOINTING.
2,Same as many other...,"I liked the topic, but when I read it, it was the same as all the other historical books, one sided and false. The book is based on exaggerated events that are written and accepted only by the fictional authors of the time, and repeated by Mr. Peter Green. The language is like his lectures- boring. If you would like to believe stories, this book is for you; otherwise continue searching for the truth."
1,Boring,"Horrible. I forced myself to read it for 2 entire days and could hardly keep awake. I kept thinking it would pickup, but it never did. The style is in essay format, which takes the excitement away from this book. I think if the author imagined that the audience might not be his students at Texas University, he would have given a bit more credit to the readers. Check it first in your local library if you don't believe me."
3,disappear?-but will P.F.R. do another?,"this band from ,MN - i.e. marcyplayground, is dear to me, esp. the lps of GREAT LENGHTS and THEM. i like apx half this 2001 cd(5 of 10)just for the music of these rockballads alone like: ""gone, even a whisper, fallin, me, you"". im very glad there were listnin tabs to these or i may not have bought it in vg cond.-really like new, wow. the jamz sound like a mixture of sean lennon, u2, muse, p. floyd?, ra...head? b/n these songs i picked i liked. now ill start hearin the lyrics. i thought their last lp was ""late great"" or ""them""-glad i gave em another look by now on this amazon. the other tracs r ok like ""amsterdam"", ""closer"" is ?-but my sis likes it. anyway, long live pfr---and in heaven w/ us all, all? - 1john."
3,Good Album to fall asleep to.,"After making ""Them,"" PFR broke up in 1997. This cd could of been better had it had some killer rocking tunes like ""Them"".Remember Pour me out & Daddy never cried. There aren't any great stand out tunes.This album reminds me of pink floyd and beach boys. Its really mellow with good harmonies. Basically if you are hard core PFR then it be a good purchase, but lets say they've done better. Contains some good interesting tunes though. I hope that when these guys come bach they totally rock out... atleast on a few songs. Cause they can really rock and roll!"
4,An overview: theoretical and practical,This book works as an introduction to the foreign langugae learning and teaching. It also provides practical ideas for those working in this field besides giving the theoretical background needed. It can also work as a training refereance for this in the field or those who will be.
1,Who made this thing?,It would be nice to know who manufactured this item. I would be more inclined to purchase.
3,Easier reading,"A companion to his work on the internal security agency of Great Britain (see MI5) and necessarily covering some of the same events involving characters from both services, this book, on MI6 the true `Secret Service' or more colloquially, ""The Circus"" reads far better, as though the author had an editor more sympathetic to the general reader, rather than to fellow historians.The sheer wealth of detailed research in West's works can be a little of a challenge and require study as much as just reading, with constant cross and back checking though, it becomes a great story, adding historical depth to anyone with an interest in this engaging period of the British fascination and need of intelligence on other enemy - real or perceived - and of course, friendly nations.MI6 touches on the great scandals of Philby et al, and is perhaps a good introduction to further reading into the events of the ""Fifth Man"" penetration of the service by Russian moles."
1,boring waste of time,"Really. Don't bother. I'm half through, there's been one murder, and I still can't stop wondering when something is going to happen -- other than everyone walking around town, drinking beer. This guy gets paid for writing????"
5,My favorite mystery book,"""Son of Holmes"" is based in a small French town just after WWI broke out. Auguste Lupa is the supposed son of Sherlock Holmes (its always hinted at, but never confirmed). Lupa must discover, with the help of a French agent, the murderer of a crime. The murderer turns out to want to disrupt France's war effort.With brillant plot, brillant characters, and a wonderfully done setting, this book of Lescroart should be reprinted and stay in print. You will not find a better book set in WWI."
3,Interesting concept,"A son of Holmes and Adler? There wasn't enough background to explain why the character was the way he was. Other than a detective ability slavish identical to his father's, I saw no familial connections. The plot was interesting, if a little confusing at times. The author assumed that the reader would have a fairly intimate knowledge of World War I era France and so skipped some explanations that might have made the story clearer. A nicely readable addition to the Holmes catalog, but not brilliant."
4,Elementary my Dear Lupa!,"This was a great read, from the introduction to the end....Lescroart gave Lupa enough of his ""father"" but still keeping a sensible distance as to not create a clone. I just purchased Rasputin's Revenge, and I'm looking forward to reading it! I hope you continue to write more A. Lupa stories!"
4,Barnes and Noble,i bought this book at Barnes and Noble for $3.95 along with 'Rasputin's Revenge' for the same price. it's on the clearance rack. pick it up for a great read.
5,Great coffee taste!,This product has great coffee taste and would buy again. My package contained 15 pieces so must limit myself to 2 daily. A far better product than american coffee candy. Uses real coffee in candy.
1,Your price is too high.,"I rate this with 5 stars but your price is much higher then where I buy this. I buy this, 4.2 oz $1.69 per bag at China Town, Flushing, Queens, NY. I open your page if anywhere I can get at better price. Its too expense."
3,Some good old film,"This DVD reviews the life of Winston Spencer Churchill with emphasis on the war years of 1939 thru 1945. The video is interesting and informative. However, I was disappointed in the narration. Many of the films shown do have audio where you can hear what Churchill is saying. Unfortunately those who made this video preferred a narration over the actual words by the men themselves, i.e. Churchill and Chamberlain."
5,maravilla en miniatura,"es una excelente camara de video, con una resolucion deslumbrante , facilidad para poder manejarla con solo una mano, y una calidad de construccion esplendida.tambien hace soberbias tomas estaticas con su sd card .Puede fimar con muy poca luz.....y en color!!!La duracion de la bateria es razonable, pero mejor comprar otra aparte de la que viene con la maquinaUna segura eleccion, de las mejores mini dv del mercado."
1,looks fake,would have sent it back but i forgot about it and waited too long. It loos cheap and very fake. hate it.
4,Retarded LP from a Retarded lyricist..,"Vintage Funk Doc... Arguably the most consistent Emcee and definitely in the top greatest rappers of all time. If he's not, then you're smoking something that I never want to touch... Quality.. Worth the wait... God-willing, Def Jam and Jay-Z, who in my opinion is biased and is not doing a good job, will promote it properly..."
5,Redman is BACK!!!,This album is tight...I'd probably give it a 4.5 but it rounds up to 5 so thats what I gave it. I only need to skip like 1 or 2 songs and the rest is hot...can't say that about too many CD's released recently. Great production with some sick beats makes this album one of the best of 2007 so far...just waiting for that Fab album now...
1,Very Dissatisfied.,"I am very dissatisfied with not only this product, but with Amazon's ""Make Sure It Fits Service."" I ordered this ""mounting kit"" to mount a sony xplod head unit into my 1998 gmc jimmy. I used the aforementioned tool to be absolutely sure it fit, and it said it does, however, it does not include any mounting brackets, and it it too small to fit the mounting cavity anyway. On top of all of that, the instructions included do not even make a sad attempt at explaining how to mount the bracket, and leave much to be desired. Do not buy this product, spend the extra time and money to buy one at a store where you know you can get what you need, and you wont have to deal with shipping back and forth to get a refund. as this ""kit"" was only around 12 bucks, i will just chalk this one up to a loss for me."
2,Doesn't fit 2001 suburban,"I think this kit is not for the installation because it doesn't have bracelets ,i doesn't look like the stock one .i sent it backGet this one ""Metra 99-3002 Dash Kit For GM Truck And Van 95-05""It is perfect fit on 2001 Chevy suburban."
3,no mounting brackets,Although this item advertises itself as a kit IT DID NOT COME WITH any mounting bracketsFurthermore The product page does not mention this or List the brackets as a common item also boughtThe package lists the bracket numbers but I could not find them on amazonLuckily I have the original factory brackets that I can make work but I feel that if there are additional products needed todo an install they should be listed on the product page
2,Terrible description,If you have a grand prix 2001 or up dont buy its very misleading but i called and talked to them they sent me an email with ones that work so im giving it 2/5 stars (this was only because it was misleading dont think its not good)
1,Poor Collection,The problem with this collection is that much of it is inaccessible to any one who wants an understanding of post-colonial studies. There is too much jargon and all of the excerpts are presented without any framing context so you are often confused while reading the essays. This is an exceptionally poor selection for students.
5,The finest that Eloy has to offer,"I have personaly purchased most if not all of the original albums that all the songs were originally released on and that this is one of the finest collections of Eloy that the band could offer. Each of the songs represents an era in time and space that the band completely accels in. The songs chosen for this compilation are very good selections to give someone who is not too familiar with Eloy a good idea of the band and for avid fans a disc to have all their favorite Eloy tunes on. A very wise choice to purchase this disc. Jeff Loving Maryland, USA"
1,THIS IS NOT ELOY !!!,ALL SONGS IS RE-RECORDED AND MIXED I993...THIS IS NOT ORIGINALRECORDING...THIS IS FOR ME...LIKE SOME BAND PLAY ELOY'S SONG'S.......I FEEL BITTERNES...
3,I only needed one piece,This is a large kit for a large selection of cars. Do a trial install first to see what you really need. A smaller kit may work fine for you. I only used one bracket which I could have probably made myself.
3,Handy but not necessary,"I'm not sure why they advised the purchase of this ""Multi-kit"" upon purchase of my new stereo. The stereo came complete with all necessary hardware. Kind of a sales gimmick to get you to buy ""one more thing"". The kit was complete and I was advised by the installer that MOST stereos DON'T come with hardware, so I kept it."
2,Not what I expected,I was not able to use any ideas in this book as it already had a theme that the crafts were based on. I was hoping for something that related to stories from the Bible or open ended crafts.
4,Good value,"My very first Invicta watch and probably not my last. I own 2 tags, movado, technomarine and swiss army. This watch looks like it belongs with my collection. Looks classy with the roman numerals. It is a well made timepiece. I like the weight and overall construction in stainless steel. A definite steal under $100."
1,that's look like a fake watch if it's not fake,"from the first look i could say, it's a fake watch, in it's own catalog it said it has three button; two in the right side and one in the other side, but in the real world it it has only two in the right side wich means that somethings is souspicous with this watch.beside that it doesn't look as described in the web.i returned it the 2nd day after i got it, right now i haven't received any refund from amazon, and i haven't received any message that confirm he get the package back, therefore i'm waiting hearing from you soon.thanks for your customer interest.yassine"
2,You will need a magnifing glass,"Very attractive, very comfortable watch band, but all 3 displays have such poor character detail you can't read them without a magnifing glass. Your better off purchasing a Sieko design in the same style, which I have, wherein all dial characters are crisp and legiable."
1,poor sound,"If your buying this, as I did thinking Uriah heep on DVD-A will sound great- sorry the sound quality is less then average dont know why they bothered putting it into a high rez formula. Definatly a waste of moey"
1,Screen shield disappoints,This screen shield did not withstand the removal and placement of a cover I'd bought for the rest of the unit. Air bubbles kept appearing.
3,Not Sexy unless your 45,I give it three stars for the price. If you are going for a woman younger than 45 good luck with this. If they are older your in business.
1,Smells like alcohol - cannot be returned,"I'm a fan of the Jovan white musk and thought I'd try another sent as well. This has a very aggressive alcohol odor and cannot be returned (For safety reasons, items that are classified as hazardous materials or use flammable liquids or gases cannot be returned to Amazon.com.). So I learned that online is not the best place to try out those products."
5,My Favorite,"Been using this for a few years. I've gotten more compliments on this cologne than any other. 5 stars for the cologne and for Amazon's price which was the best I could find. One word of caution: use sparingly. Like most colognes, it's pretty potent."
5,great toy,"My son received this as a gift, and it is a great toy. A whole lot of fun, works great, does wheelies, goes really really far. My son is 7 and it took him about 10 minutes to get used to doing it. He loves it, and no batteries!!"
5,This book is the best,"I learned C++ programming in five weeks just with this book. I got A+ in class. Those reviewers who have negative reviews on this book, is becuase they do not have programming skills or good math, Java, and C background.I recomend this book for these who have previous experience in programming and want to learn C++ independently."
1,Practically Worthless.,There is hardly enough rubber on the bottom to keep water from going down the drain. I have standard drains and by the time I fill up my sink and walk to the living room and back the water is gone. I guess I have to go spend $10+ dollars on a sink strainer to get something that works....How sad is that to waste $10 on a strainer? I could buy two $10 footlongs at my local sub shop.
2,Didn't know this was used,"The packaging was bad, and it came dirty. I had no idea I was buying a used product. It works ok, but wish I had known it was not new."
4,Cool Money Clip,This clip is pretty cool and unique! My friends love it too! I just wish it was a little bigger though.
5,It's pretty rad!,"I purchased this money clip for a friend, and I must say that although I thought it was going to be bigger, it's perfect size and everytime I see it I love it more because it looks pretty snazzy!"
3,You have to have a wad of cash!,This clip will not hold just a few bills. They just slip right out. I was bummed about that. It does look very nice though.
1,toughguy soft core,"these guys are no very good musicaly they should give up.personallt they talk alot of tough talk and walk a mile of tough walk as long as your intimidated,younger smaller&weaker than them!when the odds are even they need knifes,chains,bottles and odds of 8 to one and they will attack your women too. bad band and lame music and bully's to boot."
1,Expected hardcore but got cheese metal,"This album is horrible. The lyrics are cheesy, the music is boring and the songs feature 80s era metal solos. This really is a bad hardcore album. Try buting an All Out War, Turmoil or Vision of Disorder album instead."
2,Fun for about an hour,"This game was fun for only the first day I owned it. It is far too easy to beat (did so that first day) and it does not keep you coming back for more. I have not played this game in a long long time, and don't see myself playing it again in the future."
3,"Smash, Smash, Smash. I like the mindless violence.","Fun game. You smash things. Lots of things. Cars. Coke Machines. You name it, you smash it. You get sweet guns and rocket launchers. Yet after playing it for 36-48 hours straight, it really lost its appeal. I mean, how many times can you smash cop cars with baseball bats before it stops being fun. Well that's a bad example, but I think you get the point. Overall, good for a laugh, but you might be better off renting it for a while."
3,Bland Beat em up... IN 3-D!!!,"I know that this was for the PS1 and the N64, but it's just another Beat em' up with better graphics. It's alright. I played it for about half an hour before I got game over. A decent little time waster. Reminds me of an arcade game."
2,Mindless Button Mashing,"Fighting Force starts off strong, good graphics and fairly exciting gameplay. Un fortunately it goes down hill from there. All of the games bosses can be defeated by reapetedly pressing the X-button. There is no character depth, the cut scences are lousy and you spend more time staring at the loading screen than you do playing the game. It took me an hour to beat it with a friend and it wasnt worth it. The games only redeeming quality is the multiplayer, but that gets old very quick. Stay away."
4,an overlooked classic,"i purchased this cd on a whim and boy am I glad I did. This has some great ""classic"" dance tunes that have formed the basic building blocks for dance music today. This is by far one of the best ""artist"" albums by a dj to date. It's a shame this never received the attention it should have, perhaps one day it will."
3,I bought it just because of Head Hunter by Front 242,"Head Hunter is a killer song - a must for any club anthems collector! This piece was a killer in the reykjavik, iceland club scene in early 90's"
3,blah,This is a represents a good case against unmixed house music .. It seems like danny was trying to put together a decent collection of anthems and vocal cheese .. while forgeting the people who wanted to own this for home usage. I got this expecting more of his deep house that he spins on his earlier Global underground mix GU005? I think. and Was hit in the face by a big block of cheddar. Some of the vocals are decent and there is some flash here and there. Its just not that deep. And the tracks are all made to be mixed .. so they get hella repetivite. Some of the high points save this album from getting a less than average score. Like music is the answer for instance. Hardly the dance album of 98 ..
1,Unlogic Description,"Nokia 3100 is using BL-5C and Nokia 5100 is using BL-4C, and in the product description it mention some models that does not use the same model of battery, the two models completely different in size and one model cannot fit the Compatibility phone of the other, so i suggest that the seller should check which model is this battery, and what is the mAh of it"
3,A Shocking Turn In Events,"Just when you think you've got the ""happily ever after"" part...As the 3rd book in a 9 book sequel it takes the adventures of Alisha Williams and Gray Eagle on another path. Alisha Williams is madly in love with her Indian lover who she feels has betrayed her. Heart-wrenching and worthy of being read."
3,So-so,"This wasn't as bad as the first book in the series but I found myself not so much feeling empathic with the female characters as much as I found the really annoying with their complete inability to help themselves. ALSO, can Taylor not write a male character who is not a rapist? Really? Even the leading man is a rapist w/ uncontrollable lust? Slightly ridiculous but the characters are just interesting enough,and she writes just enough of a cliff hanger to make me keep reading."
3,I LOVE THIS WATCH,"I owned a Seiko railroad watch with a white face for since 1983. I wanted a black watch and found this one and I love it. Great price. The easy to read contrast of the black face and the white hands, simple elegant design make this a great deal. Plus no battery to damage the environment. I'm going to buy another one. Thanks Seiko."
4,A Handy Reference Book for Students of Theology,"This book is intended for college students who would like to make frequent reference to the teachings of the Church in their class room as well as private study and it serves the purpose well. Important documents of the Church are arranged under different topics of Catholic doctrine and are very easy to refer to. I have found this book more helpful than going to Densinger and most of the relevant and important documents are here. The documents are beautifully indexed with a topical index as well as a general index. There is also a table of reference to Denzinger's Enchiridion Symbolorum. It is indeed a very good contribution to the students of theology by the Jesuit Fathers of St Mary's College, Kansas."
5,Wonderful addition to my bluegrass collection.,"I had posted a review here, and now it is gone! That's strange. Anyway, I bought this on a recommendation of a friend and I think it is a really wonderful CD. Ronnie's voice is pleasing to the ear and very suited for bluegrass music. The choice of songs is great and some of the back up singers, i.e. Ricky Skaggs, Vince Gill, just bring this CD all together. LOve of an Angel and THe Lord is my light are my two favorite cuts off the whole CD."
3,Only for not Blink 182 fans,This is a biography only for not blink 182 fans or new fans of this incredible punk californian band. For the BIGGEST fans.. you need to buy for only one reason.. to make complete your collection... but isn't to worst this cd.. buy and make your own opinion.
1,Blink-182 Fans Must Read,"Okay, This CD is lucky I'm giving them 1 star. See, I saw this CD at the music store and I am a huge Blink-182 fan so I had to get it. But this is after I bought THEIR book ""Tales From Beneath Your Mom"" and some of the stuff just sounds like it was made up by the people who made the CD. Like it says that Tom and Mark met outside Mark's college but in the book it says Anne, Mark's sister met Tom and then she set up MArk and Tom to practice. So now I know why its unauthorized. But I mean, I'm still gonna keep it cuz I still love Blink-182 but you can count on me only listenin to it maybe once more, if I want a good laugh. 1 more thing, it barely had Blink-182 say anything. So you choose."
1,How bad can bad get?,"Im a huge Blink fan, I decided to pick up this CD thinking that I would hear Mark, Tom, and Travis talk about what goes on in their life. I thought wrong, you hear this english woman speaking, theres some strange music in the backround (not even Blink-182)and you hear Mark and Tom speak on occasion. Please save your money get The Urethra Cronicals instead!"
4,Cell Battery,Just like the OEM. Great for a second battery and the price is right. Last about the same as the original.
4,Great Battery,I was unable to speak for more than 20 minutes on my cell phone with the original battery - Since replacing with Utstarcom Audiovox OEM Vx6700 I am able to use my cellphone for a whole day without charging the battery.The battery was delivered on time. Thank U.
2,"Reptitive from Previous Books, Mostly","Book Review by C. Douglas BakerFIRE IN THE BLOOD is somewhat disappointing. For those who have read the previous four books in the series, it will get quite boring. Jack is such a clumsy and sometimes stupid guy, he can't seem to keep his head from getting smashed in over and over again, despite his super human strengths and abilities.The book does introduce us to Jack struggling with the morality of being a vampire and his need to feed on blood. Elrod begins to explore this inner struggle as Jack loses controls of his actions. But the novel leaves the resolution of these problems to future books. If Elrod can get out of the rut of writing repetitive plots that read just like the last book, and further explore Jack's struggles as a vampire, good things will happen.(And since I've now read every single one, I can tell you indeed, this does happen.)"
2,Dying on the platform,"Fun and reassuring, occasionally practical. Overall, a good read, not an investment for career."
4,"A Japanese family disintegrates, violently","Set in the 1940's, this is the first in a series of mysteries featuring private detective Kosuke Kindaichi.The elderly patriarch of a wealthy Japanese family of the title, dies, inexplicably leaving a will that virtually ensures a bloody battle for his fortune.Kindaichi is summoned by the family's attorney to snow-covered northern Japan, where the gore-soaked feud plays out. Slowly, the family's sordid secret history is revealed as the members are ritualistically murdered, one by one.Kindaichi is a likable character, an eccentric whose odd mannerisms (like a nervous tic of head-scratching) hide his superior intelligence.The translation is a bit stiff at times, and some plot elements seem forced, but otherwise this is an enjoyable mystery. The atmospheric setting (the Inugami family's labyrinthine lakeside villa, in the winter) brings the reader to a region of Japan not well known in the West."
3,"its aight,","I been listenin to baby beesh since he was in the latino velvet and N2Deep. He's now joined up with Dopehouse Records. I respect dopehouse records and baby beesh, but this album wasnt all that tight. His lyrics were goin off, but the beats werent as bangin as when he was with Latino Velvet Clique (produced by, Funk Daddy, Johnny Z, and K-Lou) But I feel that Dopehouse needs to get new producers because these guys signed on dopehouse do have talent, but the beats are just a lil weak."
5,MORE SPM AND LESS BASH!,"THIS CD I BANGIN LIKE A CRIP FROM COMPTON! BUUUUUUT THERE IS NOT ENUF SPM ON THIS CD! THIS IS BABY BASH AT HIS PRIME! NOW ALL BABY BASH RAPS SOUND THE SAME! PLAYED OUT! COME WITH THAT V-TOWN FUNK THAT YOU STARTED WITH! NOT THAT POP-CORN RAP YOU SPIT NOW! JUST BE YOUR SELF AND TAKE OF ALL THAT MAKE UP! OR MAYBE ALL THAT HAIR DIE IS GETTING TO YOUR BRAIN! BABY BASH YOU DON'T NEED IT! LESS TIME IN THE BAUTY SALON, AND MORE TIME READING A BOOK OR IN THE STUDIO! PLEASE!!!!!"
5,Great photos and Interesting facts!,Hardcover. Great condition. A couple shelf scratches on the back of the book sleeve cover but doesn't bother me. No tears or worn pages. I play beach volleyball on these beaches and I wanted to know the history behind it. Great conversation piece!
2,We're sending our love down a well...,"Unfortunately, I have to agree with the first reviewer. The reverby sound renders this cd almost too painful to listen to. Which is a shame, for I feel that these are some of the greatest pieces written for the guitar. Perhaps Halasz can record a second cd for those of us who prefer an intimate ""guitar in your living room"" sound, rather than the ""guitarist trapped in a well"" sound."
4,Chestnut's OB Anesthesia,Excellent Text. The book I bought was the newest edition and was what I expected. The definitive text for OB Anesthesiologists.
5,Top Read,"Griggsby Wright, MD says:This is the Bible of OB Anesthesiology. Dr. Chestnut has taken his area of expertise and has put it into a text that has become known by all in the specialty.The changes in physiology of the peripartum patient are well-described as are the management options of the high-risk patient.Anyone who manages OB patients should know this book."
5,I received exactly what I had expected!,"As a child I recall seeing this movie at the local movie theater and seeing it again was cooky how high tech it seemed them, but nonetheless, I was joyed to view the movie again after all these years and enjoyed recalling what I so was entertained with and always remembered about this movie as a child! It brought back a lot of memories from then! Thank you!"
2,CREATURES FROM THE BLACK LAGOON UNDERGROUND!!!,"BY TRYING TO COPY THE STORY FROM ""JOURNEY TO THE CENTER OF THE EARTH"", THIS MEXICAN PRODUCTION FROM THE 60'S MANAGES TO ENTERTAIN WITH MONSTERS THAT DWELL INSIDE CAVES AND DEVOUR PEOPLE!! CALL ME CRAZY BUT THIS MOVIE BROUGHT BACK MEMORIES OF MATINEE SHOWS OF MY CHILDHOOD!!"
4,"great coffee, noisey enough to wake the dead","If you love coffe, you need this machine. But the design, as cool as it looks on the counter is flawed in my opinion. It's really noisey. So if there was some way to muffle the sound on a lazy Sunday morning, it'd be perfect."
5,The Best Game Ever!,I dont think anyone who has played this game before that gave it a bad review really even likes games. I found this game the type of game that i crave when i'm playing a game similar to it. Other reviews tell people to not buy it but i think that if you like games like this and you DO buy you'll be happy with your purchase.
4,A fascinating glimpse into Barokian style,"I will be brief. These recordings, made between the late 1920s and 1940, are technically deficient in showing Bartok's fabled tone (though a little of it comes through) but musically fascinating in showing how much more lyrical and gentle his playing of his own music was than that of most pianists today. Based on this evidence, then, pianists like Annie Fischer are much closer to Bartok's musical concept than Gyorgy Lehel or many of the others who have recorded his concerti in recent decades. A major resource for students of Bartok's music. (Only four stars given because of the scratchy discs and boxy sound, not because of intrinsic musical value.)"
2,Leaves much to be desired,"I have to agree with Ballpoint legs - this textbook is adequate as a survey, but when it comes to the mathematical, the textbook fails to provide clear explanations of concepts that then lead into examples with reliable solutions. I have trouble feeling that I have a deep understanding of the concepts, and I feel unprepared for the problem sets in my class. Unfortunately, this is the textbook assigned. So much for going to an Ivy League institution."
2,Buy the Sony!!!,"""You get what you pay for"", and well this is a perfect example!!!Fair optics and the pictures are a little fuzzy/out of focus/ distorted on the edges. Used it 1 hour and back it went!!!The Sony telephoto is 2.6 x magnification , $30.00 more and REALLY does the job!!! Don't add a lousy lens to a good camera. So Beware of this one........it's not what your're hoping for........."
4,good beginner violin,Nice violin -good sound. Great for a beginner.Nice value for price.Only improvement would be about the case. Compartments not big enough to hold shoulder rest. It would be helpful.
3,Intermediate to Advanced Book,"If you already understand basic options, then this book will add the finishing touches to get to another profitable and consistent level. Ignore the bio and personal commentary and skip to methodology or ""how too."" There is substance to the work if you can read between the lines.The main thesis is like poker there are ""tells"" as to when the stock will move and to what price. The market specialist or maker is unfettered in making a 2 sided market, so must hedge in the underlying stock or options markets. This explains the basis for the tell and has been DRJ's secret. Not a bad indicator as this explains the underlying movements."
1,The amazing evolution of DRJ,"Why is it that some people feel the need to be famous at any cost? Anyone who has followed the ""exploits"" of DRJ has watched his football career grow and grow over time. In four or five more books he'll be in Canton. He is a DPM in a number of stocks, he was on the board of directors of the CBOE, but check the Chicago Tribune for the circumstances around his exit from that post. Check the Chicago Sun-Times for their take on his ""inside information"" when he tipped the world to a public meeting of the NYSE and CBOE through 1010wallstreet.com. Better to leave the technical writing to writers, he should stick to fiction, like his resume."
3,It is supposed to be good.,I ordered this because people said it was a good way to stay healthy and have taken it over a few years. I can't really say if it worked or not.
1,WARNING - MISINFORMATION by AMAZON.COM,"I thought this product was from d-Alpha Tocopheryl since that is what is listed in the FIRST ingrediants, however that is not what you get you will receive dl-Alpha Tocopheryl.(...)"
3,Slipknot Lovers,"I recommend this cd for all the slipknot lovers, who wanna know more about all the 9 slipknot members, all about there lives and how were they grown up, all their favorite bands and everything!"
1,Fake Image,"I am sorry to inform you, but this image is not at all from a yanomami man and child. It is an image taken in the border area of Brazil and Peru, on the Javari river or one of it's affluents. Looks like Mayoruna!"
3,"Good, but cinematography is mediocre.","As a producer of videos on Amazonian Indians, I am keenly interested in other videos of Amazon tribes. This video brings up some good points about native societies, but lacks spectacular images of indigenous people that I was seeking."
1,Mmmmm!,This was not what I expected! I thought it was gonna be more informative. It felt like the whole DVD was like the introduction of a big book so you're left sitting down waiting for a lot more! Anyways it's my personal opinion!!!
5,This band is awesome!!!!!,I discovered this band back about 10 years ago and I haven't stopped listening to them yet!! Industrial rock!! SWEET!!!
5,One great band.....one awesome album...,"If there is a band out there that has the resemblance of Disturbed, this is it....I've been listening to the same four songs ""Awake, Plug, Car Bomb, and Who Am I?"" for months now after file swapping. I had to get my hands on my own copy. I do not regret it one bit. Go ahead, pick up a copy if you can. You will surely be surprised...."
3,Decent CD,"It aint that bad, its worth listening to. Reminds me of Coal Chamber and Bile, so if your into that sort of thing, check it out."
4,It's all about the recipes!,"There's the greatest chocolate cake recipe in the book that I've ever tried, and the spice cake recipe is melt in your mouth wonderful!"
4,Entertaining and Delicious,"As a huge fan of Michael Lee West's novels, I had to read this book and I was not disappointed. Its not exactly a novel; more an autobiography centred around southern traditions and cuisine. For those raised in the deep south, I've no doubt it will bring back lots of happy memories and, for those of us not from those parts, its a wonderful insight into a place of steamy hot weather, fireflys and traditional home cooking passed down through generations (with some of those generations being somewhat eccentric!). I defy anybody to read this book and not be inspired to get into the kitchen and try out some of the many recipes contained in the book. I spent much of it salivating."
5,BEYOND GUMBO,"I SELECTED CONSUMING PASSIONS TO READ ON MY FIRST FLIGHT AFTER THE SEPTEMBER 11 TRAGEDY. I HOPED IT WOULD BE A ""COMFORT"" READ, i.e., FAMALIAR, SOUL-FEEDING, COMFORTABLE AS A PAIR OF OLD SHOES, AND HUMOROUS....SOMETHING TO KEEP MY MIND OCCUPIED AS WE FLEW FROM LOS ANGELES TO HOUSTON. I LOVED IT FROM THE BEGINNING. I READ IT OVER A 5 DAY VISIT WITH COLLEGE FRIENDS CELEBRATING OUR25TH YEAR OF BEING FRIENDS. THE BOOK WAS THE PERFECT COMPLIMENT FOR THIS WEEKEND. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK FOR ALL SOUTHERNERS OR LOVERS OF ALL THINGS SOUTHERN. THIS BOOK WILL TUG AT YOUR HEARTSTRINGS AND APPETITE."
3,"Understandable, but somewhat flat","I have stand alone copies of the Apocrypha (or Deuterocanonical Books) in the KJV and NRSV and as part of complete Bibles in the RSV-CE and the Third Millennium Bible. This NRSV is a good servicable translation, but I find it somewhat flat and less literate compared to the others. On the otherhand, for readers unused to the KJV/AV, that version of the Aprocrypha can be a little difficult. My favorite translation of the Apocrypha is the RSV. It is more readable to a 21st century reader than the KJV/AV translation and more literate sounding than the NRSV. Unfortunately, it is difficult to find it in a stand alone volume (i.e., not included in a complete Bible).Since writing this review the RSV-Second Catholic edition has become available. I bought a copy specifically for the Apocrypha/Deuterocanonical books. It is, however, an excellent translation all around whether you are Catholic or not. (I am not.) I really wish we would see the ESV with Apocrypha."
4,"good quality, could use more historical notes","OK if all you want is the text. If you want any sort of details on authorship, time period written, notes on why these may have been excluded from the protestant canon you'll need to look elsewhere. Nicely bound."
4,Good version to read-,Just wished it included the book of Enoch. Will have to purchase it separately.
5,METHOD 51 KICK ASS,"Method 51 are one helluva cool band. They mix an explosive combination of rap and metal. If you like Stuck Mojo, Limp Bizkit, or even Rage Against The Machine, this is definitely for you."
5,Entertaining development of British politicians,"""First Among Equals"" is primarily about the ambitions and educations of four aspiring British politicians from the 1960s to the end of the 1980s.We watch them learn, grow, and become who they were meant to be -- fulfilling their destinies as they discover who they are, what they believe in, and what and who they are willing to sacrifice to reach Number 10 Downing Street.They learn to balance their personal lives with their personal ambitions.The plot and acting are first rate. The characters are intriguing. I found some of the supporting characters more intriguing than the some of the four primary ones, but that only adds to the enjoyment.I found myself watching five hours straight without realizing it -- the story is that interesting.Even though my favorite did not win in the end that only made the story that much more intriguing."
1,Not worth the Time!,I frankly found this film to be very boring & predicatable inspite of a fine cast of actors who did their best to save this turkey. I urge you to save your money and read Lord Jeffrey Archer's excellent book that this film was based upon instead.
1,Love the show but won't buy the DVD,I absolutely love BG but won't be nickle and dimed like that. I absolutely refuse to pay double for a split up 2nd season. Are you listening Universal Studios?
1,Sci fi at its lamest,"Slightly better than Stargate SG, doesn't compare to Star Trek the Next Generation or otherwise. The characters are weak and are not developed well. Try another show like Heroes, which has some stronger characters."
1,Sex Crimes In Space...,"Why, oh why do they insist on ruining these sci-fi shows with PC dogma? I enjoyed the first season immensely, and season 2.0 showed promise, then BAM!, season 2.5 turns into Galactica, Special Victims Unit. I won't stoke the fires of the current mania by listing the subjects covered in these episodes, but be prepared to witness a promising series come grinding to a halt while we are exposed, over and over again, to what the Lords of Universal deem the ""important"" social, i.e., sexual, ills of society. Add in a liberal dose of ""acceptable"" soft-core, and you can see this is not an enjoyable, escapist fantasy."
5,Consistently good,"I was very happy to discover that the second half of season 2 was as good as the first half. I don't have much to add that is unique compared to what other people have said, but I wish that the Pegasus longer version was the ONLY version released. With the first half of season 2, you get the broadcast version, and with the second half you get the ""better"" (longer) version. I'm just not a big fan of redundancy."
5,REALLY GREAT TV,"Best show I have seen in a LONG Time! Lots of action and interaction. and I love all the surprises! I was a huge fan of the original, and it is great how they use the same character names and bring more to it."
3,Show gets 5 stars...,"...but the split release is ridiculous. I am happy for those who don't have to consider money as a factor when making a purchase, but for some of us this factor is important.For those who say ""the DVDs won't fit in one set"", how do Buffy and Angel manage to get 22 one hour episodes in a single set for under $50? I just picked up Seasons 1 of Arrested Development and Veronica Mars for under $20 each. Universal is nickle and diming, and I am patient. Fact: there will be a combined Season 2 release (just like how they released the pilot, and then they released Season 1 including the pilot), and it will cost less than the separate release."
5,Love this remake,This is really how to remake a classic. They do a great job love the series and the DVD did not disappoint. The only gripe is that they broke the 2nd season into two parts.
5,Great series,Battlestar Galactica is a suber show. It manages to give a fresh now look to sci-fi series. At the same time it also focus on drama making a very enjoyable coktail. Defenatly a must have
4,Better and fracking better,"If you are interested in buying this item I will spare you the plot details because you are probably already as hooked as I am.Suffice it to say this is one of the best shows on TV, and it keeps getting better and better. If you liked the miniseries, season one and season 2.0 this is going to blow your mind, and has a season ender that will leave you screaming at the TV because you have to wait to watch what happens next in season three.It would have gotten 5 stars if not for the obvious money making ploy involved in splitting this season into two packages."
4,"Season one is better, still head and shoulders above all else","The Australian boxed set release included all 20 episodes for about $50 US dollars? Is this true or rumour? If it is true, we got screwed. Season one was a much better show, I preferred Helo and Sharon on Caprica! Anyway, enjoy the first half of season 2. It is still a great show, much better than everything else on tv. Eureka is excellent though..."
3,Vol. 2.0 is not the high point of the series,"Unfortunately, Battlestar Galactica season 2.5 is just about the lowest point of the series thus far, but that does not mean that this set is not worth your money. This set is sure to contain a massive quantity of special features and there are a few episodes that are quite good, e.g., Scar, Downloaded, and Lay Down Your Burdens parts 1 & 2. If you are an avid fan of the series then of course you will buy this set, but if you have never seen the series before I advise you order seasons 1 and 2.0 first."
2,"After such a good start, Season 2 takes a turn for the worst.","Last season (2.0) saw the beginning of the ""Pegasus"" trilogy ending with the first episode ""Pegasus"". This season (2.5) includes an extended cut of ""Pegasus"" and moves on to the following two episodes ""Resurrection Ship, Parts I & II"". The trilogy started off so well with ""Pegasus"" and even the first part of ""Resurrection Ship"" wasn't bad, but part two is when things start to fall apart. The only episodes worth watching in this season (2.5) is the last four episodes, and maybe even the the first few, but most of them were crap! Crappy plots and no real action. Disappointing."
1,Lame Season Finale,"I never watched this show on TV. When I saw that Seasons 1 and 2 are available on DVD I bought them because I loved the original show. I wasn't disappointed until the end of Season 2. I loved the plot twists throughout the show but when I saw the Season 2 Finale I could do nothing but being totally disappointed. Baltar the ""bad and crazy guy"" becomes president. Roslins is a teacher again and doesn't seem to care about politics anymore. The huge time jump and stuff. I don't kmow how someone can find this entertaining. I for one found it irritating and not compelling storytelling. Who am I to say something like this? I WAS a fan of the show. I hope they bring Season 3 out on single DVDs with four episodes per disk with a reasonable price. Then I can decide if the show gets better again but I won't waste my money on a Complete Season DVD box set of a probably bad show."
2,"Same old, same old","Same old, same old. Likemost modern shows nowadays, GALACTICA seems to feed from the same general rule: a bunchh of characters, when forced to choose between some options, ALWAYS use the worst or stupid one! In that way you create drama!"
5,The only television worth watching,The only television worth watching.Perhaps the best and most well though and acted science fiction ever. Makes the last 3 Star Wars movies look like the childish pseudo techno babble it was. Only Babylon 5 compares.Thank you to all that was involved. A gem in a sea of $rap.
5,The Best TV Has to Offer,"I enjoyed Season 2.5 a little more than 2.0. Perhaps that's because as far as the second season as a larger arc goes, this half seems to be where the buildup and climax was.BSG is best when it gets epic, so I tend to find the two-parter episodes to be the best. Early in 2.5 there are the ""Resurrection"" episodes and the season ends with the ""Lay Down Your Burdens"" episodes--both examples of Battlestar at its best.Everything that has made this series great--character and conflict first come to mind--is here, but the mystery surrounding the Cylons' motives deepens.Most TV is not that good. But Battlestar has managed at least two excellent seasons. I can't wait for Season Three to come out on DVD."
3,Writers Block,"Unfortunately, 2.5 marked the end of an awsome series. Still worth watching for any fan, but doomed to disappoint. The writers hit a wall; relying on formulaic convention from the first season and a half instead of creating new.They let some of the best relationships/interactions just disappear, jumping forward in time arbitrarily and ignoring fertile plot lines. Even the believability faulters. By the end, I was left with the feeling of disappointment from potential unrealized, even discarded."
5,Why no Emmy nod?,"I thought that the writing for Season 2.5 was superior. Not just for science fiction..but, for drama. I cannot believe that this show was overlooked by the Academy. You couldn't ask for a better cast, better scripts or a better storyline. This show is one of the best on TV."
4,"Expensive, but worth it.","A lot of people gripe about the price of this boxed set because it only covers half of the BSG season, but if you really enjoy the show, and compare it to shows such as Star Trek The Next Generation, and 24... you really are not paying that much more for a quality show.This is the BEST Scifi series I have ever watched. The special effects, the acting, the casting, and the story lines are well concieved, and executed. I will not complain about the half season set, or the price when I stop and consider the fact that I will be watching this show over and over again.Don't let the price keep you from making the purchase."
5,Battlestar Galactica 2.5,"On the product itself, awesome series. Absolutely love the dynamic and the real world social themes that soar through the show. Easy to watch, addicting, and it's not over-the-top ""space-y"" so that many types of different people can watch it.I do think it's a little ""price-y"" for only 10 episodes. It would be nice if you could buy an entire season for the same price."
3,battlestar galactica season 2.5,I ordered this for my son and watched it with him and became a fan of this show
5,Battlestar Galactica,I ordered just before Xmas and received order extremely quick--impressed with how smoothly everything went especially during the holidays.
2,"purchased as ""new""... not what i received.","This box set was previously viewed and had clearly been re-shrinkwrapped to achieve the appearance of ""brand new"" status. Box had signs of wear and tear. When opened, found scratches and finger prints on dvds... NOT NEW!"
4,Well crafted and stark science fiction,"This has to be the most intense science fiction ever viewed, the music, the acting, the plots, the characters, and the communications style, all intense, all subtle and irreverent, yet deeply and emotionally reaching. However, it would be strongly recommended that this not be presented to children; the drama, the character interplay and the intimacies therein are highly charged, sometimes graphic, sometimes base, and sometimes beautific in nature, but all very mature, if not borderng on the sensually debauched. Although I believe this has to be one of the best choreographed science fiction series of all time, particularly the writing and character interaction, all said, this is one of the most intelligent representations for its Genre."
4,Can't wait for the 3rd. season!,"Really good. It feels now just like Babylon 5 felt in 1995.Great series, even if you're not a sci-fi addict."
5,Not your father's Galactica,"There are many great reveiws here- Ditto to the accolades and step by step commentaries. In gestalt, the series is aging like fine balsamic vinegar; multiple layers of concentrated and pungent aromas creating an essense that both satisfies and leaves a desire for more. A heady draught that leaves intermingling aftertastes both strong and pungent yet filled with intricate subtleties. Highly recommended for mature audiences not afraid to examine the viscerality of a dwindling humanity; plunged raw and vulnerably into a hostile environment with primal emotions dissecting credible survivors of near utter global and galactic, holocaust. Do we really deserve to survive?And...they have a plan.Recommended highly for all adults of all genres- no sci-fi interest required."
5,Wonderful Job!,Starless Night is the best Drizzt book after homeland. Drizzt is still the most favourite char of the FR and his charismatic heroic acts make him one of the best characters ever! The Cover Art sux! Drizzt is much much more handsome and younger than this venerable ugly thing. And...DRIZZT DESERVES ALUSTRIEL!!!!
5,SPECTACULAR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I don't think enough can be said about this book! I just lose myself in Drizzt's challenges and the eldest bearne is about the best yet!! I love the whole journey back the Under Dark and Cattie Brie was amazing!! Salavatore is doing a magnificant job with evolving and maturing Drizzt throughout his travels. Once where the Hunter was dominant within his psyche now it's a controllable aspect that helps him through extremely difficult trials. That was excellent!!!! I just hope that this vintage Drizzt stays just the way he is. Long Live Salvatore!!!!
3,stupidly funny,"I liked this book okay, but the audio version was unintentionally hilarious. Simon Jones' renderings of Jarlaxle, Matron Baenre and Cattie-Brie are probably the funniest things I've heard in a long time. 2 thing that bothered me though: Leaving out some of my fave scenes(Drizzt meets the unicorn ect) And the pronounciations: I think it's Drisst, not Dritst. And Zaknayfeein, not Zaknuhfain...."
5,FOOLS!,"anyone who says that this was a book which deserves less than 3 stars, they simply cannot understand good books, and they don't deserve to read fantasy books. this is one of the best books i have ever read, and if someone has judged it by the cover art, they are completely stupid."
3,"Good, but there are better Salvatore's","Unfortuately, this book didn't enthrall me the way Homeland and Exile did. There are several wonderful moments -- Drizzt's character is interesting as ever, and the confrontation between Matron Baenre and K'yorl Odran is masterfully handled. Unfortunately, Drizzt's escape stretched my suspension of disbelief a little too much -- I almost felt like I was reading a Jackie Chan movie. The plot was good, but not as masterful as in some of Salvatore's other efforts."
5,These books are amazing. Read them. NOW!,"The entire Legend of Drizzt series is simply fantastic. Drizzt's journey takes him across the vast and varied world of Faerun, with breathtaking landscapes and incredible character development. If you're not reading these books, you should be."
4,Good,"A tale of conspiracy and companionship, Starless Night is a book worth picking up. R. A. Salvatore proves once again that he is a master of his trade. The only thing wrong with this title is a few grammatical errors, but even those don't diminish this work of art."
3,Not so noble,"Definitely better than ""The Legacy"" but still not my favorite fantasy series. Why? I just don't get Drizzt and Catti-brie. He's oh so noble that he keeps considering basically stabbing Entreri in the back - the fact that Entreri is the bad guy is so not the point here - and she's one angry woman with no respect for anybody, hissing and spitting at anything that even dares to disagree with her. They are so not the noble heroes that Salvatore wants them to be."
5,WILL USE EXTENSIVELY IN MARCH!,THIS IS AN EXCELLENT BOOK TO REVIEW IN PREPARATION FOR OUR TRIP TO THESE ISLANDS AND A REFERENCE GUIDE WHILE WE ARE THERE.
3,Wildlife of the Galapagos,"While on Galapagos, we checked off in this book all the wildlife that we saw daily. We went snorkeling twice and saw many species of fish. Unfortunately, this book does not have a section on fish."
4,power antenna in a Cadillac,"The antenna was reasonably priced, after much difficulty getting it installed, it works and looks great. Installation was a bugger. The instructions need to be improved as to how to select the correct spacers for different applications. This job took two hours when in reality it should have taken 5 minutes."
1,Good while it lasted,I brought this antenna to replace my OEM. The install went flawless and the antenna worked well for the 1st month or so. Then I noticed while pumping gas that the mast was leaning so I figured that the mounting was loose. But upon futher investigation I realized that it was loose within the body of the mast. And a few days later the mast was completely disconnected from the base. OhI forgot to mention that this was my 2nd and last purchase of any Metra pruduct.
1,"Continues to ""extend"" and ""retract"" and motor makes grinding noise.","Two units installed so far...First unit motor made loud noise after the antenna was fully extended, as trying to ""further"" extend antenna, made noise for about a minute then stopped. Made same loud noise when antenna fully retracted, again for more than a minute.Second unit was quiet and functioned as it should for about a week. Now making noise after fully retracted.Again getting replaced.Had these antennas installed when I had a new dash radio installed by a pro shop. I would not recommend the Metra 44-PW22 to anyone."
1,Pass on this antenna,"This product is very cheaply constucted. The installation was easy enough, though after only five up and down operations the motor began to get really hot. I disconnected the 12v and let it cool down, but the motor never worked again. The only saving grace to this antenna is that it can be manually raised and lowered. This is the only reason I won't return it but come on dead after 5 uses!"
3,Craig's Power Antenna Review,"The antenna itself was okay; however, the advertisement stated that it would fit my Mercury Sable Station Wagon which it did not. I would not have bought the item if it had correctly stated what vehicles it would fit. Product was returned and I lost the shipping to and from as a result."
1,Power Antenna with no power,"Bought the Metra 44-PW22 to replace a factory power antenna in a 1996 Nissan Maxima. By the wear on the flip top of the box, I could tell this individual product has been passed around more than a couple of times. Took out the old power antenna and hooked up the electrical to the ""new"" Metra. Heard a nice click but the antenna did not budge. <Insert lost time here!>Packed it up and sent it back.1. Electrical problem.2. Don't like products that have been around, opened, used and then returned.I would like to properly rate a Metra product. I just need one that works out of the ""factory sealed"" box."
4,ANTENNA FOR JEEP,"THIS PRODUCT IS GREAT, IT WORKED WELL AND EASY TO INSTALL, I HAVE PUT IN A JEEP GRAND CHEROKEE LAREDO 1995 THANKS.Metra Universal Power Antenna (44-PW22) (44-PW22)"
3,Universal Antenna,Affordable and does the job that an original replacement would do without making a hole in your pocket. I recommend this item for the DIY person.
1,Radio Antenna,"The unit looked all intact. Although it did not fit the car I ordered it for. The wireing is different, and the antenna wire has the wrong end on it, both ends are males. To make this unit work I will have to trouble shoot the wirering to find the hot and ground wire then slpice the antenna wire together. This unit was sold as a replacement unit for a 1998 fire bird antenna and it is not."
1,Permanently jammed after 3 rivets,"I'll be returning this next time I go near their store (ACE Hardware). The first three rivets snapped into place satisfactorily (but not easily). On the 4th rivet, it jammed. The tool would neither release the partially installed rivet nor continue to complete the setting. I had to McGuyver it off and finish the project with nuts & bolts. I was using rivets from the same manufacturer in the correct size for the head installed. There was no ""ratcheting"" action to make setting easier - probably due to the tool's incapability to release its grip."
3,Fun game,"It has playstation graphics, not the best but still a fun game to play. Each level is a different puzzle lots of thinking."
2,zzzz... zzzzz... zz...... huh? oh sorry I fell asleep...,"This game is ok, I guess.... I don't really understand why you got to kill animals and things... This game is too dungeons and dragons for me... I like more action, games you don't have to think so much.... graphics are good, and I am sure alot of people might enjoy it.... It is just too slow for me....."
5,A Classic Adventure Game,"I can easily say that this is my favorite game of all time. The graphics and cut scenes are amazing, the levels are beautifully done and very exciting, and controlling Lara is a lot of fun. I was never bored with any part of the game, nor did I get frustrated at it for being too difficult. The combination of excitement and difficulty was done just right - not too much or too little of either. The worlds Lara travels through are enchanting, and I love the fact that she's a strong female lead in an amazing game. I thoroughly enjoyed all of the games in the Tomb Raider series, but I feel as though this one, being the pioneer of the series, is a true classic."
2,Meh...,"(Not really a kid by the way, just a teen who REALLY enjoyed the movie)Well, I was quite surprised at the sound listings of the soundtrack. When I saw Snakes on a Plane, I thought ""Well, if the movie's this great, then the soundtrack must be just as good."" (Nothing can top SoaP, even it's own soundtrack XD )But I didn't except indie bands to be the center around an epic movie like SoaP. I give it a two just for the first song, but if your a die hard fan of Snakes on a Plane, and must get all the merchandise to support the movie, then I guess it's ok if you get it, but if anything, your better off developing your own playlist out of the songs from the ""Snakes on a Blog"" website. Not only is it good music made by the fans, but most, if not all, of the songs are original and not remixes."
2,I'll give it 2 stars just because it's Snakes on a Plane,How could such a great movie have such a terrible soundtrack.
4,Conner Peterson Would Like It.,"No need for the track by track review. Overall it's a good album. I have XM so I don't buy CDs anymore, but I bought this one at Target for 10 dollars.Most tracks are good few ones that I skipped over.Good remixes of songs that you have heard a million times.I can't get any of the extra stuff to work on my computer."
1,C1500 - after 800 cups - it has problems!,"I'm on my second C1500. My mother has the same unit and is getting ready to return it to the store after a bad customer support experience with Capresso Phone Support. She's on #2 going to #3! A store manager where I bought my unit has the same problem...After about 800 cups, the whole bean coffee comes out very weak. The tamper quits working.The only thing that works is the ""pre-ground"" method. Very disappointing. Funny that we all have had the same bad experience.Nice overall look and simple controls. But one must question the mechanics of this system. Not reliable."
1,not impressed,"i was very excited to push a button and have a fresh brewed cup of coffee but it was too good to be true.after one week of use it broke. i sent it back for a replacement (very good customer service, by the way) now the replacement has stopped grinding the coffee and i cant get the steamer to work properly. i have the maker for two months and it is not worth the hassle. a friend who has one also has sent hers back for trouble too."
1,Save your money,"They burned a DVD copy of a video tape. I can only view it on my computer, the DVD player won't recognize it. The picture is grainy, low resolution, not worth watching.Wait until someone does the transfer for real."
2,This is a good movie,"This DVD provides no features or options. I found it to be very unprofessionally made. The quality of the film is horrible in most DVD players. They only one I could get the movie to play correctly in was a DVD Recorder. I recommend you purchase Horror Classics 50 Movie Pack Collection from Amazon. It contains The Screaming Skull and 49 other good horror films. For all 50 movies, it only costs $12.99!!!"
1,"I still like ""The Screaming Skull""... BUT...","I remember seeing ""The Screaming Skull"" on a Saturday afternoon when I was about 10 years old. It was scary then... More than three decades later, I am still a fan of the movie, but probably more for reasons of nostalgia than anything else.My only beef - and apparently I'm not the only one who feels this way - is the lack of a decent print. I own both the ""Reel Classic Films"" and ""Alpha Video"" productions. Both are poor transfers. The RCF version is cut up, missing ""vital"" parts of the movie, and some of the scenes in the AV version are so dark that you cannot help but wonder what is going on.Still, I'm a sucker for the ""classics,"" not to mention the beautiful Peggy Webber. If you liked this movie as a kid, then get it. If you've never seen it, then you'll probably be disappointed. If a decent transfer ever surfaces, then I'm going to get it!"
5,Great old time gospel quartet CD!!,"I just purchased this CD and love it. It hearkens back to the days of gospel radio, pure and unvarnished. The technical production is superb and the harmonies very tight. This is a fun CD!"
1,do NOT purchase the Beat Experience CD ROM,"This CD-rom is a total waste of money. It claims to be ""more than just an anthology."" It claims to be many things it is not. Poetry & prose are not even presented besides a few noisy sound blips. Trying to be akin to a literary version of MTV, it is barely eye candy. Although the exhibition of which it was based, The Whitney Museum of Art's ""Beat Culture"" had many faults, this CD Rom doesn't even warrant debate; its just plain bad. I feel especially disappointed because of Voyager's (the publisher) fantastic CD Rom of Art Spiegelman's ""the Complete Maus."" While ""Maus"" is a fantastic work of art with plenty of cross-referenced materials (akin to the Museum of Modern Art's exhibition of Spiegelman's material), ""The Beat Experience"" is an utter failure on every level."
3,A Peer Review of Bottle to Throttle,"I went to elementary school with Rob Grunke, the author. Our lives clearly diverged after the 8th grade. Rob's memory of his early years were far more disgruntled than my own. But that was his life versus mine. I was disappointed that he chose to disguise the names of the people we grew up with, save the famous ones. But that is his choice. Assuming the veracity of the story it's admirable that he wrote it."
4,A solid product,Assembly was fairly straightforward and the product works very well. The wheels aren't great unless you're pulling it on a very level surface but it's solid and I would recommend it.
4,No trick surprises.,"While the conclusion made sense, it was too well hidden to be easily discerned by the reader.After reading three books I'm still waiting for the characters to become old friends."
3,May cause you to scream,Inspector Ian Rutledge is sent to a small town to find two missing children but instead of answers he finds more questions. Even though he is constantly haunted by a ghost from his past the inspector expertly wades though the evidence to find the real truth.This is a mystery book so there are several crimes to solve. I found that about halve way though I was yelling at the pages saying all right that's enough time to solve. The clues were subtle but obvious and a casual gumshoe would get it right away. That said I love the fell of this book and would recommend it to anyone who likes mysteries.
4,Riveting,"Our war damaged Inspector is once again sent out by his boss to look into the murder of a woman and her missing children. The village police chief, resenting Scotland Yard's intrusion into his territory, believes he's arrested the murderer but Inspector Rutledge appears to harbor doubts. In speaking with the prisoner, he discovers another war damaged soul, but the man is horrified and shocked by what he believes he has done and cannot be drawn into speaking at length about his wife and children without collapsing in catatonic grief. But where are these missing children? And what of the man who was seen with them? At the same time, another body is found. Is there a connection?"
3,"Slow moving, but worth the while.","I had a really tough time with this book. Initially, I found it very slow moving, but I stuck with it. For me, it still didn't really pick up until towards the end when Rutledge starting piecing things together, but I'm glad I saw it through. The ending totally caught me by surprise. I never saw it coming."
3,Keep with this one if you like the series,"I wouldn't recommend this as an individual novel, for there are far better mysteries, not to mention books in this series by Todd. However, if you are reading the series in full, you should keep trudging through this one for the rewarding last quarter of the book.It's really, really slow moving and dull for more than half the book, and has been noted in other reviews, comes up with a good ending that is surprising and entertaining. So I was glad I stuck with it. As I continue to work through this series, I hope I find this book is an abberation in pace."
1,Poor material!,"This book is not even for children! Not recommended for professionals, the ideas of this book, are just common sense, is not worth it, so don't even think about buying it!Erika SilvaDirector of Online Culinary Marketing School[...]"
4,"Fast, accurate introduction to menu design","My cherished copy was ruined by a zealous employee who went wild with a highlighter. But there are a lot of good points that deserve to be highlighted and remembered. I really like this book as an introduction to menu design. Having dealt with the owners and managers of several thousand independent restaurants, I know most of them don't know or practice everything that is explained in this book. I want all the designers, sales people and customer service people at Menu Works to read this and be thoroughly familiar with all the concepts. (Menu Works is the menu design company I own in South Carolina.) It is a quick read, with review questions after each chapter. It was written by a college professor with food service management experience and possibly intended for use as a textbook.Menu design is a very visual process, however. The major drawback is the lack of illustrations. For this drawback I deducted one star."
1,really really basic,"A lot of repetition of really obvious things. Really basic definitions of margins and profit. The book could have been reduced to 3 pages it would have been good enough. No real focus on restaurant business.Might be an eye opener if you are 10 years old and were thinking of opening a restaurant. If you are serious about your project, you will not learn anything in this book. Useless..."
3,highly rated... poor fit,"With a NR rating of 31, this is about the best hearing protection you can find. However, as with many muffs, if you have a hat size over 7 1/4 you may find these a tight fit. The wire bales on each side do not open far enough. Still looking for a better fit."
5,Better than even expected !,"I used these for the shooting range here in Texas. They surpassed my expectations ! Plus, the price was great."
1,All broke within six months,"We bought three of these from a local sporting goods store last fall. All three ended up breaking at the same spot, the plastic sleeve on the muffs where the metal tines slide in and out split. They also didn't fit the adults well, it seemed those same metal tines were just a bit too short, so the muffs couldn't come down to make a good and comfortable seal. Worked fine for the younger teens, though."
1,Star Safety falls short,"Cannot comment much on the earmuff's ability to work as needed. I am sending them back since the earmuff unit that was received was broken. They also appear to be USED! The one earmuff was dangling by one wire/hinge attachment. The other hinge had been snapped off completely. The bag the unit was put in was clearly cut open at one end. The paper instructions were mangled and one earpiece looked dirty. The shipping box they came in looked fine and did not appear to have been tampered with during shipping. It looked like they were put in the box that way.Star Safety customer support said their products are shipped from a warehouse [in a different location] and would follow-up on what may have occurred and send a replacement. However, when I called back to find out what happened to the return label/information email, they simply said they were issuing a refund and I needed to return the merchandise. Bizarre."
1,Terrible noise reduction,Noise reduction of 30dB? Who are they kidding? I can hear myself type this right now with these things on. I can hear the scoot of a chair on carpet. There's no way I'd wear these to a shooting range.
5,fantastic puzzle,"this puzzle was great! it was challenging due to the similar colors and the same subject matter over and over. after the puzzle was complete, it looked like it would be a cool poster in a bar. the puzzle pieces were nice and sturdy, so you don't have to worry about them ruining or bending easily. great durable puzzle for anyone who likes a little bit of a challenge."
4,Beers. Puzzle,My family enjoys doing puzzles during the winter season. This one was a challenge and alot of fun. It was always a race to get to the puzzle nightly to see who could find more pieces. the different brands really made it fun and interesting. We glued it together and will frame it and hang it in our basement playroom. Great price. Fun gift for under the tree.
5,#1 Duff fan,"I think this is Hilary's best Collection. I love the new remixes of ""Wake Up"" and the making of the video. Don't buy ""Most Wanted"" or ""Most Wanted Collector's Signature Edition"" if you are planning on buying this, because this is basicly the same as the two together and more. But if you want all of her album's that's a different story. I think Hilary is great at singing and acting. She is really good at singing vocals, like in ""Fly"". I loved her TV show ""Lizzie McGuire"" it acts of a normal teenage life. They may have exaggerated a little bit but still realalistic. Hilary's #1 fan."
3,For Danzan Ryu - Small Circle Jujitsu Practioners,This is one of the few books out there that gives some history on Prof.H.Okazaki the founder of Kodenkan-Danzan Ryu Jujitsu. If your a practioner of Small Circle Jujitsu or DZR you will find this book interesting. The author gives good advice on limiting the amounts of techniques and to hone them to there fullest capibilties. It was interesting to see that back in 1962 the round about time frame for attaining a black belt was between 2 1/2 yrs - 3 1/2 yrs. Wow have times changed $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
3,More collectible than chess set,"The item arrived with a dent in the tin. I didn't send it back because I figured it would probably get dented anyway - we plan to use it as a working chess set as much as a collectible. A lot of the time it's hard to tell what chess piece the Pirates character represents so it makes the game somewhat tedious, which takes away from the fun a little bit. I'm thinking we'll get used to what pieces are what, be we haven't gotten there yet. One big caveat: I can't imagine anyone learning to play chess with this set since it's so hard to tell which pieces are which - I would consider it to only be appropriate for a somewhat experienced player. It does look cool though, so it definitely makes a good collectible."
4,Delightful,"I loved this book! Such a wonderful cast of characters, Grady Jackson, Tailpipe , Abbie Birdsong, Sophie etc.. , a fiction writer would be hard pressed to dream up such a group. The story is fascinating, the mysterious Spanish treasure, the farcical machinations of the criminal justice system , the 4 tons of pot that disappeared, Grady's Pig Latin heroics on Guadalcanal during WWII, all true, and all great fun to read about. I laughed more than once at Mr. Merritt's wry , often self effacing cynicism. For example , ""I worry and struggle to make things happen and , often as not , don't add any more to the result than if I had been trying to make things come out the other way"". In addition, Bill Merritt's clear and direct writing style makes the book easy to read. If you like extraordinary true stories with colorful characters, you will love this book too."
2,Mediocre Fiction,"Why was this book in the non-fiction section at the library? I can understand changing the names of people but counties? There is no Siletz County, Oregon. Why not make up the state too? As fiction there leaves a lot to be desired. The back jacket says""truth is stranger than fiction"". Either write non-fiction with names changed to protect identities or write a compelling novel. This is neither."
3,A better game than the original,By far this game it's much more fair than the original Tomb Raider. This one at least let you safe the progress anywhere in the game without looking for any type of save crystals which made original game incredibly difficult and punishing. This sequel may not be the best game out there for the PS1 but at least it's a bit more fun to play.
5,Flavorful Fruit Cake,"This is a tasty moist fruit cake with sweetness from the ingredients. While I personally prefer a bid more cake for body this still makes the grade. I was pleasantly surprised by the taste, flavor and texture."
5,Excellent Fruitcake,"This cake was delivered shortly after I ordered it, so I stored it till Christmas. Somewhere I think it says you can keep fruitcake for three months. This one kept six weeks and was excellent. I never noticed at all that it was sugarfree. If this cake becomes available, I will be ordered again for Christmas for my husband who is a diabetic."
5,Amazing,"This really works to keep off acne. You apply using a cotton pad. After waiting a minute or two for it to dry, I proceed with my moisturizer.Mary Kay has great products - I first started off with one and discovered its other products."
5,Perfect for spot treatment,"I normally don't have much acne, except for that time of the month. I can just squeeze some of this product into a cotton ball and leave it on the pimple for a minute or so. The pimple goes away in a day or two!"
5,Excellent (and tiny) GPS,"This little GPS, while not having any removeable memory nor a large bank of memory, does VERY well with what it does have. It easily stored a 6 hour hike in it's memory, with less than half the memory used. For street mapping, it has a connection for a computer -- And coupled with Delorme Street Atlas USA, is a high-end solution for in car navigation. (Requires the cables and a serial/USB converter, which are reasonably priced and excellently assembled at the pfranc project.) The eTrex cable/converter is the same for this Geko.The battery life isn't really a negative -- ten to twelve hours of operation is just fine, and you can replace low batteries without losing information, so nothing is hurting there. Overall, the price for this unit makes this unit an excellent purchase. Only complaint is that the color is a bit ugly -- And the stretch holster offered by Garmin doesn't do anything for its appearance either."
3,"Excellent choice for back packers, but may have a fatal flaw","At first glance, the Gecko 201 seems to be an excellent choice for a back packer's navigation system. The super compact size and light weight were among the primary reasons I chose it. It's very easy to use and it seems to be a good value based on price and features.It should be noted that it's low cost comes at the expense of even the most rudimentary accessory. It has nary a belt clip and the manuals are the only accessories it comes with.As much as I like the unit however, it may have a fatal flaw. The power on button is not protected and is very easily activated. Someone tossing it in a day pack or back pack pocket may find the batteries drained when they next get it out.If I were Garmin, I would design a mechanism to disable accidental powering on of the unit. Absent this oversite, I would have rated it 5 stars as a back packer's GPS in this price range."
4,"Subject to the Y2K+10 bug, but fixed!","My Geko 201 was subject to the so-called Y2K+10 bug. For any time period after January 5th, 2010 the GPS device incorrectly calculated the date. This resulted in an incorrect (dysfunctional) almanac which caused an excessive amount of time to be taken to acquire satellites. This problem was apparently fixed with the March 25th, 2010 release of firmware update 2.90. Otherwise a nice compact, easy-to-use GPS, but with limited battery life."
1,Wrong Item was sent to me,This is not the item I received. Instead got some crappy friction material that had nothing to do with a GPS. Company that shipped it said Amazon listed the wrong item and offered to refund all my money plus shipping.
4,I would recommend this for its size and performance,"I have owned this GPS for about a year now, I love it for it's size and detail it provides on the track log or ""breadcrumbs"", it can remember ten thousand points, which is great for downloading your last trip. It pulls in signals very well. I se this to find my car in the parking lot at the shopping center or after a sporting event. There is just one flaw I found and I wish garmin would issue a fix via software update. If you put in a jean pocket or in tight quarters. I have on several occasions had my batteries go dead cause the unit powered on, it takes just a very quick touch of the power button to turn it on and a longer hold to shut it off. I recommend this night and day over the Garmin 101, this unit adds WAAS and computer interface. Use the interface its great with Expert GPS to view your data or easily add waypoints."
2,Short battery life,"Using Rechargeable AAA batteries, with the Battery Saver feature turned on, about two hours. Sometimes I get more using alkalines, but not much more. Honestly, this unit is worthless, because I can't trust the batteries.Order a Garmin Etrex Legend instead. It isn't much more expensive, larger or heavier, and it includes a base map of roads, towns, and shorelines. The Legend comes with a cable to transfer data from your computer. The Legend's screen is a bit larger, but shows much more detail. And - the batteries last hours and hours."
3,Geko,"I purchased this Geko 201 for Geocaching. It is not the easiest to use for that purpose; however, it can be done with an external compass in hand."
4,"I like it, but it's hard to get to know","This is a remarkable unit - the way that it reads through the trees in the woods - pretty impressive, but it is complicated (to me) to make it do all the things it's capable of. I got it for the enhanced reception and use just the ""breadcrumb"" trail, but it can do a whole lot more. So for those of you out there that need a unit that reads through forest cover on your weekend walks at the local state park, this is the one. You'll never get lost again. I like to go off-trail and haven't gotten lost since I got it."
3,"Sounds Good, doesn't it.","I've been down this road before. Buy the book, get involved with it, learn a few things then forget them. But, there is value here. Methods such as these do start the creative juices flowing, plus exercise your technical abilities. I won't put too much weight on these methods, but Wolf Marshall has put out some wonderful aids for the developing guitarist.Choose those licks, or songs you like and rehearse those. Developing a language of your own sounds easy. But it's not. It takes some time and a boat load of dedication.My hat is off to Wolf Marshall, he's jump starting the process, but you have to keep at it. YOU HAVE TO PUT IN THE TIME AND EFFORT. There is no substitute for that phase of development."
5,Stone Fox VHS,My fifth grade class read the book Stone Fox. We also had several activities that wecompleted to reinforce a wide variety of language and reading skills at the reading level of the novel. As a culminating activity we watched the VHS movie Stone Fox. After the movie the students analyzed the similarities and differences between an original text and its dramatic adaptation. The students loved the novel as well as the movie!
1,unhappy,"never received the product. Very disappointed. No response from email, but my credit card was charged. Very unhappy with site and service."
1,Jura Garbage,I have a Jura E85 coffee machine that I bought only two years ago. It is already falling apart. Expensive junk. I thought that something from Switzerland would have been good quality. I was wrong.
1,Great when it works,"This fully automatic ""espresso"" machine is a great convenience when it works. Generally they break within two years; do some searching online before buying any junk items from Jura-Capresso. I had mine 16 months and aside from needing lots of expensive filters, descaling tablets and cleaning tablets (much more expensive than other companies' cleaning tablets) it made decent espresso. The steamer never did have much umph, certainly not enough to produce a nice fine froth and it has a silly beginner attachment permanently affixed so you couldn't create a good froth even if it did have the steam volume necessary.Overall a dismal failure, even at the discounted price of $2200.Buy something else."
3,"When it works well, it's great, but customer service stinks!","My office has had this machine for almost a year, and while it does make decent (not the best) coffee, my major complaint would be the(lack of) customer service!I have tried unsuccessfully for over two weeks to get a live response to my complaint about the ""start"" button being inoperable, but I only get emails that indicate I should call their toll-free number that NO ONE ever answers! Talk about a waste of time. I'm ready to throw my machine out the window and make my coffee the old-fashioned way."
1,"Shoddy quality, horrible customer service","Capresso appears to have only one Repair Center in all the U.S. (in Pennsylvania), and any repair requires shipping the unit at your expense ($150) and a few weeks waiting for it to be serviced.Mine broke down several times. Twice from compacted coffee grounds in the grinder, and the last time from a dead water pump -- all within weeks of warranty expiration.You can get as good or better a cup of coffee from a Senseo. I fell for the hype and the promise of quality from a high price tag, and now I have a very expensive door stop."
1,Disappointment at a high price,"Money was no object when I bought this machine. It is beautiful. However, it failed to live up to its hype. Too much engineering, too little quality coffee. The self-cleaning mechanism would kick in when I was expecting coffee, the coffee itself was inconsistent in strength and the steamer could not produce froth no matter how I tweaked it. Talking to tech support at Capresso did not help. I wound up returning it to Amazon."
1,This can be hacked by outside attackers,People can compromise your coffee maker and take over your computer as a result. Coffee isn't worth that risk.
4,Still learning...,"Having never worked at a Starbucks or otherwise, I only knew that I liked boutique coffees more than Folgers, et al.. Trusting the products lines of the local gourmet Kitchen Store, I tried many of their machines on display, noting ease of use as well as the final product. In many cases it came down to the obvious, personal taste and the particular ""roast"" being used. Trying to spend my $4.00/day specialty coffee money on a machine that would appeal to design, ease of use, reputation, functionality and most of all the coffee it ultimately produced made the JURA/Swiss made extremely attractive. I realize nearly $2000 for a coffee machine seems a little crazy to many, but you do the math. The short list included the slightly more expensive S8 with the dual heating elements for shorter down time, but the touch control LED won out for me. No looking back, I've been extremely pleased with the F9 and the automated promps are a ""no-brainer""."
1,Sent in 6 times in 3 yrs,"when you spend $2000+ for a coffee machine,the last thing you expect is to have multiple maintenance problems. i'm on my 5th refurbished model now and only after approximately 50 cups since the last repair. Customer service has always been very nice and helpful, but since you have to wait for labels to arrive to you via the mail and they don't expedite shipping, be prepared to wait AT LEAST 3 weeks between a break down and a new unit arriving. so for me, 5 repairs means nearly 4 months of waiting over the past 3 yrs as well. Not worth it. don't buy from this company. the number of repairs proves quality is not built into this machine (and there is only 1 coffee drinker in the household)."
1,Disappointed Translation,"This bible looked so good on the outside....but apparently i did not adhere to the old adage. When i started looking for a bi-lingual bible i realized when I bought this one that I had to choose whether i wanted a bible that was the closest translation to the new king james version OR the more relaxed NIV translation but i soon realized that one can not have both and must choose. So i would only recommend this bible if the student doesn't mind reading in a version of spanish (""castellano"") that they do not normally speak in. So no, i wouldn't recommend this bible for those like myself who have difficulty and dislike reading in castellano."
3,Just fine,"I was hoping this would be softer than it is. Not that it doesn't get the job done, but I just wish it were cozier and that it maybe didn't already look kind of old (color of material is kind of yellowish)."
3,Not very soft,"I have two other Halo sleepsacks, non-organic cotton, and both are soft. I bought this one b/c of the pattern/not too many choices on Amazon for size small w/ Prime shipping. Anyway, this organic cotton sleepsack is not very soft, even after washing ( and drying w/ fabric softener sheet). I am pro- environment etc. and I have a science background so I know there is no need for organic cotton sleepwear for my baby. And this sleepsack costs extra and is not soft, so it seems it is not worth having the organic label."
3,It's ok! Zipper is not easy.,"I bought this sleepsack b/c I like the basic concept but the zipper is awful to try to maneuver in the dark. A lot of times my daughter is hot at bedtime so I just place her on the sleepsack til later when she's cold and then I have to try to do the zipper up when she's sleeping with the zipper right under her chin. I have tried and prefer the PleaseMum brand from Vancouver, Canada. Super soft material and a two-way zipper that starts at the bottom, much easier for night time use. The halo sleepsack is great if you're just going to put it on before the baby is asleep. But as another mom mentioned, it's not near as soft as I expected the organic cotton to be."
2,Halo SleepSack Wearable Blanket Organic Cotton,"A cotton baby garment -to me- means something soft and cuddly, what one would want for a baby. This sleepsack may have been made from cotton grown without herbicides and that's a good thing. But this fabric had a hard, sort of machined, finish. Not gentle and soft. I didn't feel it would be a very nice baby gift so I returned it."
4,Great lightweight sleeper,"Good for summer, spring, mild fall. Very breathable. Material is a little coarse, but not bad. I will use for next child also, may even buy more."
2,Didn't like the main character or the story,"This is definitely a chic-lit book. I prefer romance novels. The story is about a woman's stresses and indecisions over work, friends and lovers. I didn't admire or like her. Because of her dream job at night, she was doing a poor job at the bank and that bothered me. No integrity. She would make up sicknesses to get out of work at the bank. I wasn't drawn into the story or other characters that much, except for Will, one of her lovers. I didn't laugh. Nothing surprised or delighted me other than having a happy ending. I would not recommend it."
3,THE NEW DEMON....,"Seldom, if ever, a metal band departed so drastically from the style contained in its previous efforts like DEMON did with THE PLAGUE! They simpy quit with the straigh forwarded Britiavy metal of their two first albuns (NIGHT OF THE DEMON and THE UNEXPECTED GUEST - both classics) and changed thelves into a totally progressive rock band, totally filled with keyboards in all songs, quiting the dark lyrics and including politics an social questions instead! The result was a quite satisfactory album, much more complete and abrangent than the first two albuns, but lacking their punch. It's the kind of album that does no good for a band, due to the drastic change. I wond how the from Finland below (Roger) says this album is between AC/DC and Iron Maiden, if it is nowhere close to hard rock or heavy metal, besides the fact that AC/DC NEVER used keyboards (and Maiden very few), and DEMONS's THE PLAGUE is filled with keyboards from back to back, them being the main instrument!"
4,Had this back in the 80s'!,"I bought this album back in the early 1980s' and loved it! I never dreamed that I could find it again, but the other day I started looking just for the heck of it and there it was. It really brought back memories. If you like real classic rock, you will like this."
3,THE NEW DEMON....,"Seldom, if ever, a metal band departed so drastically from the style contained in its previous efforts like DEMON did with THE PLAGUE!!! They simpy quit with the straigh forwarded Britiavy metal of their two first albuns (NIGHT OF THE DEMON and THE UNEXPECTED GUEST - both classics) and changed thelves into a totally progressive rock band, totally filled with keyboards in all songs, quiting the dark lyrics and including politics an social questions instead!!!! The result was a quite satisfactory album, much more complete and abrangent than the first two albuns, but lacking their punch. It's the kind of album that does no good for a band, due to the drastic change. [In my opinion this album does not seem like a cross] between AC/DC and Iron Maiden, if it is nowhere close to hard rock or heavy metal, besides the fact that AC/DC NEVER used keyboards (and Maiden very few), and DEMONS's THE PLAGUE is filled with keyboards from back to back, them being the main instrument!!!!"
2,NO matter how...,"No matter how good this album can be, it's so different from DEMON''s two prvious eforts, that you really will be disappointed... Not recommended at all."
1,Real plague.....,"DEMON started so well, then released their third album and their career was doomed forever... THE PLAGUE is a progressive effort, but a unbeliavaly bad one..."
5,Awesome masterpiece,"A Demon's masterpiece. A conceptual album of bombastic symphonic prog-metal. Weird isn't it? A rare breed indeed: The music and story has a very british-industrial/foggy atmosphere, all the tracks succeed to fuse melodic and harsh structures with intense metal backgrounds that give life to this crude story about a somehow apocalyptic-decaying society, a warning scream on war, politics and institutions, society vices and corruption. Mike Hannan's art is dark and a nice complement to the experience. It was followed by the also excellent and more coloured ""British Standard Approved"
4,CLASSIC BRITISH ROCK FROM DEMON!,"The music on DEMONS' third release ""THE PLAGUE"" (1983) is one classy piece of British rock,a real standout in DEMONS' long discography.The first two DEMON records are underground classics themselves,NIGHT OF THE DEMON (1981) and THE UNEXPECTED GUEST (1982) but the group tired of the devil stuff & took a new approach both musically & lyrically on THE PLAGUE.Tracks like NOWHERE TO RUN,FEVER IN THE CITY and the downright awesome title track,THE PLAGUE are all superb,brillant tunes.The songs are unique and memorable with great solos & melodies from Mal Spooner and company,classy stuff from a great NWOBHM act.A top release from a very underated group.Record Heaven should be congratulated as well for releasing this as a two disc double cd with the original first mix.Still around,still popular in Europe 2001 saw DEMON return with a new cd,SPACED OUT MONKEY,with a yet untitled release sometime in 2003."
2,COMPARISONS...,"THE PLAGUE is nothing if compared with DEMON two first albuns, NIGHT OF THE DEMON and THE UNEXPECTED GUEST. They changed their sound to enter America, but the result was catastrophic."
2,How the mighty have fallen,"When these guys first started in the NWOBHM they turned out two incredible LPs: ""Night of the Demon (1981) and a Dante's Inferno concept album ""Unexpected Guest"" (82). Those two albums can be found on a now out of print CD (minus a couple of tracks from their first). Sorry to say for their further albums DEMON abandon metal to become a second rate Floyd immatation! ""The Plague"" was only the begining of the decline. Their next album ""British Standerd Approved"" was worse (except for one great song ""wonderland"")."
1,caveat emptor,folks who loved 'night of the demon' and 'unxpctd guest' need to be warned. demon dropped off a cliff after those 1st two albums and came up with this. not good. at all.
1,"Product bottle shows that it actually contains ""dl-Alpha Tocopherol Acetate"" as the main ingredient.","The description of the ingredients lists ""d-Alpha Tocopherol Acetate"" as the main ingredient. However, the product bottle indicates that the actual main ingredient is ""dl-Alpha Tocopherol Acetate"", an articial and very different version of the advertised ingredient. The Amazon.com listing is very misleading."
1,The package I do not come to the correct address,"The package I do not come to the correct direction address:MELISA OMAÑA BRAVO (VE3456)14375 SW 120th Street Ste #106MIAMI, FL 33186"
5,GET THIS CD !,"THIS CD WAS BAD A**!I NEVER HEARD OF PROJECT DAWGS UNTIL I GOT THEIR CD.THEY MUST BE NEW OR SOMETHING BECAUSE NOT THAT MANY PEOPLE KNOW WHO THEY ARE,BUT THEY ARE OFF THA CHAIN.IF I WAS YOU I WOULD GET THIS CD.I GOT IT AND ITS THA SHIT!BE COOL AND GET THIS CD!"
3,I received a used book!,Although the Corvette book is very informative and has great photos I was not please when I took it out of the package. The book looked used and worn from the corners.
4,Great casual Robeez,"Looks like a real sneaker, I love the softness of the colors and the ease in which I can toss it in the laundry and let it air-dry. Robeez are very durable and hold up very well. And what I love about this style is that evwen if they're a little big, my daughter can still wear them because they are so soft and thin, so I get more use out of these than I do with regular walking shoes."
5,Great Shoes for Babies!,"I bought these shoes for my son, then 3 months. They have been well worth the price. These shoes do not come off not matter what. Not with a diaper change/change of pants or anything. They have been wonderful and he always gets comments on his shoes. They keep his feet warm and keep his socks on. He has grown out of them just recently and I have purchased the Robeez booties, which also stay on well. I will be buying another pair of the regular Robeez slip-ons also. I am addicted to these shoes!"
3,Nails and Shanking Together At Last?,"If you know me, and you must, because here you are, you know I love shanks. My favorite kind are the ones made from toothbrushes in prison. Here we have some nails that can be transformed into a shank with quite a bit of ease. First thing you have to do it get some glue. You take all the nails and glue them next to each other so they are about one inch thing in diameter. After this is done, you can shank.These only get a 3 star rating because they do not come with the glue required for the transformation."
2,Beware of the Firewire problem,"I have owned the Tascam 1884 for well over two years. Within that time mixer has died two times, due to a failed firewire issues. You will know when your mixer has died. Every light on the mixer will be on and that means the mixer is dead. The first time it died, I sent the mixer back to Tascam for a repair. That cost me $275.00, so when it died the second time, I was done with the Tascam 1884. I now have a cheaper mixer that does all of what the 1884 did, only with out problems. I would recommend the Alesis Master Control over the 1884. I'm sure some of you out there have no problems with the 1884. But for me, I'm done, so be wise buyers and get the right stuff, to do what you need with out it not working for you."
3,"Good, but doesn't live up to potential.","I bought one of these about 6 months ago and it worked great with my late 2006 MacBook Pro. It was very comparable with the Mackie HUI as far as the it's controller functionality. I never tried the pre-amps on it though.Everything fell apart when I tried to connect it to my 2009 Mac Pro. The device and the computer would not recognize each other. I called tascam and got no help from them, apple was stumped too. Eventually I found out the problem was within the Fire Wire buses. The FW-1448 doesn't like converting from Fire Wire 800 to Fire Wire 400. After installing a Fire Wire 400 port on my Mac Pro I've found the Tascam will work around 50% of the time.It could be a great device, but the lack of tech support, and the Fire Wire issue really holds the unit back."
1,"Awful pictures, don't waste your money!","These View Master reels are not what they used to be. First, they are pretty flimsy compared to the reels of yesteryear. They don't settle into position very easily, and often have to be jiggled. (It's possible that is a consequence of the cheaper view master viewer they make today.)Second, the quality of these California pictures is pretty low. I was looking forward to some nice views of CA icons, but these are so poor that a child would have trouble making out what some of them are. The layering in these pictures is there but perhaps it is the poor quality of the pictures that makes the layering pointless. They seem out of focus, and for a child, many would be hard to decipher.Another really nice toy dragged down the drain by poor quality. The current manufacturer surely has no idea what the View-Master is supposed to look like."
2,Very thin,"I bought this based on the previous reviews. The book is very thin in content with about 250 cards per exam in the boook itself. It does not nearly cover the needed information. The CD is better with more flash cards per exam, and a testing engine, but still thin in coverage and explanations. It has information you can use, but not enough. If it was structured toward the exam requrements it would have been better. If you used the other Cisco press books, you don't need this, not even at the discounted price. As a comparison, the CCNA flash cards book was much better."
2,Not very useful,"Generally a pain to use and work with. The format of the book is bulky and difficult - you have to HOLD it open. As someone else mentioned, it crashed my Palm hard. It also wouldn't run on my desktop PC or my laptop, so the CD was worse than useless - it was a a big waste of time.The material seems decent, but it's so difficult to access that I just put it down and didn't pick it up again."
3,"The almost ,that wasnt","I have been an avid fan of Air Supply for many years, although there albums being in CD changer has diminished quite a bit in the last 2 years.Well needless to say I picked up their latest effort and gave it a listen. All I can say is that this is the album that could have been great, that just didn't quite make it. Body Glove is probably one of the worst songs I have heard them do. Most of the other songs are just lacking in most area's with a noteable exception. One song on this album I'd give 5 stars and call it one of the best songs Graham has ever wrote: ""You are the reason"", what a phenominal song!! The album isn't bad like the other reveiwer said it was, it's just average."
5,They're back!,"After a few years without no new CD, Air Supply comes back with this new CD. I really think that this new album is one of the air Supply's best in the recente years. Songs like ""Tell Me of Spring"", ""You Are The Reason"", ""If You Love Me"", among others, are just incredible!Fernando RodriguesCampinas - Brazil"
5,breath of fresh AIR SUPPLY,"outstanding cd,beautiful music and songs. i hope they get air play on radio stations.try this cd ,also try the new JOURNEY cd. these great bands will never die."
1,ICK,"These has-beens need to hang it up. Sadly, the duo tries to ""get with the times"" by adding rock and techno-flavored production on a few of the tracks instead of working with the melodic ballads fans love them for. With slow songs that'll put you in a coma and too-whiny vocals, I'd pay someone to take this CD off my hands. And I agree with the other reviewer who said the lyrics are the low point -these cheesy and sappy rhymes would embarass Dr. Suess. (Female hips, potato chips? Give me a break). Plus, they're just trying too hard.For outstanding, soulful love ballads, I think I'll stick with Sade or Rita Coolidge."
2,What happened???,"I was very excited to learn that Air Supply had a new album out, and I ordered it immediately...but the only thing that is like the Air Supply I used to love was Graham Russell's voice.I agree with those who say that Russell Hitchcock voice is gone. It seems that his soaring vocals are a thing of the past; He now sounds like Steve Miller with a sinus infection.The reviewer who, based on Hitchcock's clear vocals, said that ""The Scene"" sounds like it was recorded some years ago and just placed on this album may be on to something. The copyright date on all of the other songs is either 2000 or 2001. The copyright date on ""The Scene"" is....1998!!! Could it be that it was a leftover from the ""Book Of Love"" sessions?Anyway, at the price that amazon.com is offering right now, it is worth picking up this album only if you are a completist. Otherwise, you might want to pass on it."
5,"Air Supply's back on ""The Scene""","The Power of Love is back and stronger then ever in the music of the 80s supergroup Air Supply. ""You Are The Reason"" and ""There's Only One Forever"" speaks to the hearts of all as we all reach for the one true bond of the world....love. But with ""Yours Truly"" this five man band not only reclaims the power ballad but also proves that they know how to ROCK! Slip into the rhythm with ""Body Glove"" and then serve up some hot ""Peaches and Cream"" and you'll see what makes this album ""Hard to Forget."" Make no mistake that Graham Russell, Russell Hitchcock, Jed Moss, Larry Antonino, and Mark T. Williams know all about the softer side of love, but this album will put to rest the rumours that these guys and their music is too soft for the modern day rockers. ""Why Don't You Come Over"" and we'll show you!!!"
4,pleasantly surprised!,"I wasn't expecting much from this book....it's a book of words. I didn't think they'd really help me that much. But I really like it, it's set up perfectly, it has example sentences at the end of each section, as well as quizes. And it could not be MORE thorough. I'm very happy with it."
1,disappointed,"The book is ok. There are lots of words, however I didn't buy this for just a book of words.I had hoped to hear them pronounced. The CD doesn't work well I can only open it in the applications folder of my computer. And what there is is just like another product I have called 'French before you know it' Maybe I received a 'bad' CD. It is not well put together.There are many other ways to learn French on your own that are much better.I'm Very disappointed."
3,Disappointed Reader from TN,"""Only Hers"" was not as good as ""Heart of the Falcon"" or ""Forever Yours"". I felt that Matt nursed his hurt, anger, and suspicion of women far too long. It was hard for me to believe that an otherwise intelligent man would take so long to recognize that Shannon was not out to hurt or use him."
1,Too hot!,"I got this as a gift from my mom last Christmas. It was my first crock pot, so I thought I was doing something wrong when it burned everything I put in it, even on Low. Now, I know I'm not the world's greatest chef, but I thought that certainly I could manage to use a crock pot! Eventually, I learned to just about double the liquid every time, which helped keep the food edible, but it also left a huge puddle underneath from steam escaping, condensing in the rim, and overflowing. Also, I had to make sure the removable crock was perfectly centered in the metal cooker -- the worst burns were on the side closest to the metal. I finally decided that something wasn't right, and checked these reviews. I think I'll be shopping for a new slow cooker soon. Sorry, Mom!"
1,"Shame on you, Rival!","I have always had a Rival crockpot, so I never looked at other brands or reviews before buying this one. BIG mistake! At first I thought it was defective, but my daughter mentioned having the same problem with hers--this cooker gets way too hot for a slowcooker, even on the LOW setting.Last time I used it I took the temperature of the food after the lid was irritatingly rattling from the steam and there were bubbles breaking around the edges of the food. It was 210 degrees in the center.This is more like an electric SOUP pot.Works great if you want to cook at a low boil, but crockpot--never. I wish Rival would explain why they let this go to market."
1,What is wrong with this thing?,"This is a horrible crock-pot. The first one I owned went back to the store for an exchange. I thought there was something wrong with it. Everything I cooked turned into a horrible, burned mess!! I exchanged it for the same one. Same problem. It cooks WAY TOO HOT!! This one is going back too. I think I'll have to find another brand.It is so frustrating to come home thinking you're going to have a nice hot meal and instead find a shrunken up, burned meal. Or, my chili at a rolling boil on the ""warm"" cycle. My other crock-pot is a Rival and it's fine. This is frustrating!"
1,Bad Bad Bad!!!!,"I used by Grandmother's old crock-pot throughout my college and graduate school years. I never had a problem and I had a number of recipes I loved to make.When I got married two years ago, I got this crock-pot as wedding gift. I am annoyed by the comments from people who have said those who had food dry out and burn did not know how to use a crock-pot. That is false. I never had a problem until I used this crock-pot. I have tried numerous times to make my favorite dishes (dishes I could make in my Grandmother's crock-pot). Every time it has come out too dry to even attempt to eat. The sauces also burned. It makes it really fun to clean! My suggestion, go to a garage sale and find an old crock-pot. It will be better than this one."
1,"Even ""keep warm"" too hot","I took water temperatures at high, low, and keepwarm. I am at 5200 ft altitude so water boils at about 195. All temps reached 203 and the water was in a rapid boil!I have a small Rival I picked up for $12 and it works great low 190, high 199, and Warm 160!"
1,"VERY DISAPPOINTING, BURNT EVERYTHING!!!!","All these reviews are right on the MONEY!! IT GETS TOOOO HOT!! I bought this crock-pot to replace my old Rival crock-pot that is the same size because I liked the idea of the timer and keep-warm setting. I have used it 3 times and it has over cooked all three meals! I put a beef stew in it today on LOW at 9:00AM and by noon the potatoes were mushy and falling apart and it was BOILING, I hate to think what it would have been like if I let it cook for the recommended 8 - 10 hours! GOOD THING I WAS HOME TODAY!I had also bought my daughter one for Christmas, because of her busy schedule sometimes she does not get home in time to turn her crock-pot off and thought the KEEP WARM setting would be GREAT for her. But I just called her and she told me she tried cooking a roast in it this week and it come out burnt and she only cooked it on LOW for six hours!!I rated this one star because the website would not let me rate it ZERO!"
1,Good news! Bad news!,"The good news is that my food hasn't burned like that of most of the other reviewers. In fact, so much steam escapes from the defective lid that I've been trying to cook a roast, potatoes, and carrots for 16 hours now! The carrots are almost as crunchy as when I put them in. Now you know the bad news. Rival needs to get better at quality control or get out of the business."
1,Avoid this one!!!,"The other reviewers are so right; that would be the ones that said how it boils all food. I did not think to check reviews on this horrible machine until today--when I used it again. I have been saying every time I use it (not that often-- how much overcooked/burned food can a family take) that it just doesn't seem to cook right. I have never used the ""high"" setting since ""low"" was already too high. I am just glad to read the reviews and know it wasn't just mine!! So run fast when you see this one, and read the other reviews for a better crock pot. That is what I am doing next!!"
1,Burn baby burn,"I agree with all of the other reviewers--this crockpot burns your food. I cooked a 10-hour recipe in 3.5 hours. That's not slow, if you ask me. I returned it and am going to buy another product. What is the point of having a 'slow cooker' if it cooks too fast?"
1,P.O.S.,Don't bother buying this item- it's awful. It cooks way too hot even on warm and I've burned more meals than not. I'm giving up and buying a higher quality slow cooker.
1,burns food and leaks moisture,This is the worst crock pot I have ever used! It has been returned once because the first one cooked too hot (just like the second one). You have to keep a constant eye on it because the liquid will bubble out (due to the poor fitting lid) because it cooks too hot (even on the lowest setting). I have ruined several meals with this unit with the latest being 3 lbs of skirt steak. I have burned myself on it because the outside gets so hot as does the lid and don't dare lift the lid while cooking because you will get a steam burn and cause more of the moisture to escape the crock pot. Buyer beware when purchasing this unit!
1,Cooks to fast,This crock-pot cooks to fast plain and simple; do not leave this pot or you will come back to burnt food.
1,"cooks hot, insert cracked","I've had this for about a year. It cooks way too fast-as in HOURS too fast. A maze of really, really strange thin cracks recently formed under the glaze. They were visible only on the exterior, so I decided to use it again while I was home to keep an eye on it. Small dots of a black tar-like substance seeped out along some of the bottom cracks. I would not recommend this product."
1,Nothing slow about this cooker,"So glad to read some many other reviews expressing my same concerns about the heat issue. I could start a beef stew and it would be done in two hours, regardless of the time setting I would give it. I got tired of having it to watch my slow cooker, or should I rather say - fast cooker -, so I ended up just throwing it in the garbage last weekend. I upgraded to a Hamilton Beach Set 'n Forget, which I just purchased from Amazon and now we are talking... a slow cooker at last."
1,Way too hot even on low,"We have tried to cook with this pot for several years and have had horrible results. It is too hot and boils\burns the food even on the low setting. The knob on the lid got too hot and broke after just two months of use. Look at all of the other ratings and you will be convinced that this is not the slow cooker to buy. Time for me to pitch this piece of junk and buy a new one that operates as a slow cooker, not a deep fryer."
4,"Great, except the handle on the lid","As commented in the first reviewers statement, this same thing happened to me. After light use, the plastic became so brittle it snapped the handle right off. What a bummer. To replace it is $18 for a whole new lid, when in theory you only need the handle. I am going to stick it out and use tongs to remove the lid as needed since you aren't supposed to peek a lot during cooking anyways and the glass is fine (not broken). I find it to be a great kitchen accessory, and LOVE the auto shut off feature. It gives me peace of mind in case I get stuck away from the house!"
1,They sure dont make them like they use to!!,"After having a Rival crock-pot that served me well for 28 years, it finally bit the dust. I had been so happy with the one I had so I wouldn't even consider trying another brand. Costco had a nice (or so I thought) Rival crock-pot so I purchased it. I tried 3 different meals in it and had 3 failures. This crock-pot boils on low!! I thought maybe it was the size and shape so I took it back. I then went to another store and bought another Rival crock-pot that was the same size and shape as my old one. Unfortunately I got the same results as the other one I had just returned....burnt and dried up food. I then decided to go on line and do some research and here I am. There is definitely a heating design problem with the Rival crock-pots of today. If you want a ""slow"" cooker steer clear of this product because there is nothing slow about it."
1,cooks very hot & burns everything,"I love crockpots. I love cooking with them, starting dinner in the morning to come home and find dinner done. I cannot cook with this. It has evaporated all the liquid every time I have used it. If it says cook on high for 8 hrs, I will cook on slow for 3 and everything will be dried up. It just really runs way to high. I (like several other reviews) have burned my hand on this.I love the way it looks but it just doesn't work well."
1,A better option than this one,"I too bought this item and found that it cooked way to hot. Kind of defeats the purpose of a ""slow"" cooker. I've found that programmable crock pots that only give the option of programming high/low are usually the ones that run much to hot.I bought this item at Mervyns and returned it the next day. I found a good replacement though here on Amazon, it's the Hamilton Beach 33956 Stay or Go 5 quart. Although it too is programmable, it allows the user to set the actual temperature (160, 180 etc.,) in line with the item you are cooking. That way, you don't have to rely on the manufacturer ""programming"" what they believe is hot or warm. Give this one a try."
1,Add me to the stack of disappointed reviewers,"I can't add much that hasn't already been described. I got mine for Christmas and it definitely ran hotter than a crockpot should. After a dismal attempt at a pot roast, I tried heating one gallon of water in the crock on the LOW setting. After about 2.5 hours the water was gently boiling. I didn't try the HOT setting -- electricity is expensive. Why throw good money after bad?I read in some reviews that people called Rival and they had a new (hopefully working) crockpot sent to them. I tried that and got a different response. The service rep told me that the Smart Pots cook hotter than the others and if I didn't like it, I should return it to the store from which it came. Fair enough. I followed her advice."
1,Rival too hot crockpot,"I was interested to see a review of a Rival crock pot speaking to the temperature being too hot. I was given one as a gift a few years ago and it boiled everything on low. I eventually got rid of it. I had one of the original Crock Pot's from the '70's that worked great but 30 years later, though it was working, my kids had grown up and it was way to bulky to store. I'm in the market for a new one but have been wary of Rival."
1,"OOps, Take this gift back, FAST!",Got this for a wedding gift. We'll send it back ASAP! Would n't have opened the box if I had read these reviews! Put a 4lb beef roast in it for first try. It broke! It had some electronic smells in the control area during the duration we tried to use it the first time. Then it shut down and the power light was blinking. Glad we were home. The other extreme of a RARE roast would have been disastrous!Something is wrong at Rival. Another Rival crockpot I have that is not in the massive recall has electrical problems too.I don't know if they care about the quality there.
1,Too Hot Crock Pot,I bought this item elsewhere and found that it cooked on too high a heat even for the 10 hour setting. I contacted Rival and they suggested I exchange it. I did and the new one is exactly the same as the old one. Overcooked and dried out a 3 pound pot roast in 8 hours at the 10 hour setting! This is a poor product for the price!
1,Worst slow cooker ever,"I bought this slow ccoker 1 year ago to replace my 5 qt that had performed perfectly for 10 years of continuous use and finally died. I have 3 pots of different sizes and use them all the time, a busy family's best way to have healthy home cooked dinners ready during the week. From the very beginning, none of my recipes worked as they should. Family favorite roasted turkey thighs (normally as good as Thanksgiving on any day) turned out like turkey jerky with charred crust. This pot cooks way too hot on all settings. Also the liner has just crazed and now, to avoid poisoning my family by cooking in ceramic with cracked glaze, I plan to throw it in the trash. Very dissatisfied!!!!!"
1,horrible,"I've had this crockpot for a while now, and cook only on the 10 hr setting.....everything is done in 4-5 hours. This thing boils everything to death. DON'T buy it.....look for something else."
1,Boils Everything until Dry,"Do not buy it. Everything I have ever tried, boils in about an hour. I even try it on warm and it still continues to boil. I will be researching another brand and getting rid of this one. How disappointing...Rival used to be the one to get. I called Rival customer service and the woman I spoke to said that the newer ones have higher heat settings because of some FDA regulations??? Either way, I am going to Bed Bath and Beyond with my 20% off coupon and buying a Hamilton Beach. If it doesn't cook properly either, I know I can return to Bed Bath and Beyond hassle free."
1,Too hot to handle!,"I arrived home after my crock pot was on for 8 hours and witnessed the wrath of this crockpot! My hot sausage and spaghetti sauce was reduced to five pieces of sausage and black sludge! I was devastated and was sure this is a defect, but after reading these reviews, it's par for the course."
1,"Horrid, cannot leave unattended",I purchased this crock pot as an upgrade from a 4 quart crock pot that I loved. This was such a huge disappointment. It burned everything I tried to cook. I though I had a malfunctioning unit so I contacted Crock Pot and they sent me a new one. The new one did the EXACT same thing. Anything you put in it no matter what setting you set it on will cook in 2-3 hours. I am not able to leave the house when I use it because the one time I did the liquid had dried up and my pork was sriveled to nothing. I am seriously surprised seeing that others have the same problem and that there was not a recall on this product!
3,"Good products, pros and cons as anyother!!","I have read reviews that states overcook in 8hs even ifset for 10hrs and that is not quite all wrong!tip: move clockwise 90 degrees the inside cooking pot everyhour to avoid overcooking one side what mostly happens in the left part of pot! Use gloves, the surface is really hot!One have to be clever, avoid opening cover on and on when cooking and you will get very good gourmet dishes for the family!Choose a smaller crock-pot if you live by yourself or two people only! This one cooks for a small family!"
2,"Yep, too hot!","As so many others already pointed out, it boils everything even on the low setting. I used to be quite successful with my old crock pot, but I replaced it with this model and since then crock pot meals have just not been the same. The meat ALWAYS comes out dry, even though it's been cooking in plenty of broth for hours on end on a low setting.The lid never really stays on, moisture collects under it and it starts to wobble to the rhythm of the boiling that goes on inside, spitting hot water everywhere and of course all the heat escapes too. Which causes more boiling etcTotally not the point when using a crock pot!I do like the size, quality and removability of the crock itself though, but it's pointless if it doesn't produce nice meals!So, a new one is on it's way! Let's hope we can go back to crock pot meals as they should be!"
2,"Lid too light, causes loss of moisture and rattling (with fix for it)","The biggest issue I ran in to cooking with the CrockPot SmartPot is that the lid is too light for the pressure that builds up. I think that this is what causes two of the major issues listed in other reviews 1) the lid rattles, and 2) moisture escapes. As pressure builds up, water begins to accumulate under the edges of the lid. This causes the water to evaporate around the lid edges, thus it drys out too fast. Also, this causes the lid to float on the water which has accumulated under the edges and it start rattling (a LOT - very annoying). To solve this I put a round, heavy casserole dish upside down on the lid to weight it down which worked quite well. Once I did that, I got great meals. It does cook very hot. I am not sure I would feel confident putting it on low and going to work all day without putting a LOT of liquid in it. Given what I now know, I would not have bought this product."
2,Sputters are driving me crazy,"I'm glad to hear I'm not the only one having the ""sputtering"" issue. I've tried to describe this to my friends but no one knows what I am talking about. Probably because this is the only crock pot that does this!The liquid collects around the rim of the lid and sits there. The lid starts to float and then sputters out of one side, creating a mess on my countertop and a (potential) fire hazard, I would think. I have tried everything (using less liquid, using a liner, drying off the lid and lip every 20 minutes). Ridiculous to have to put this much effort into using this thing.Definitely boils liquid on the Low setting, although I've still gotten some tasty meals out of it. Also cleans up easily.Still, having to babysit this thing and worry about coming home to a burned-down house kind of defeat the purpose of a slow coooker."
1,Doesn't even rate highly as a paper weight,"I bought one of these things on sale locally and should have listened to that inner voice that said, ""Remember,you get what you pay for"". The voice was right again.Had I read the reviews posted here PRIOR to buying this potential flower box/target range object, I'd have bought the more expensive competition on the next shelf higher. I won't go into the details as they have been detailed by the others singing its low praises. I'm simply adding my voice to the chorus. Save your money. Buy and OLD Rival Crock Pot at a garage sale, instead. Those units are pretty much the standard and will work well for decades. This thing is a poorly designed (Miss Smith's 5th grade engineering class?)piece of junk that will eventually end up in a landfill next to all the other poorly designed pieces of junk you wish you'd never bought. C'mon! Cough up the extra bucks and buy the Rival's rival. This crockpot isn't worth the effort of having to remove it from the box."
1,I only gave this 1 star because there isn't anything lower,"Mine quit working altogether after less than a 1/2 dozen uses. When it was working, the ""Low"" setting had things cooking at a hard simmer/low boil....certainly not the slow cooking I was looking for.Don't waste your money."
1,THANK GOD I AM NOT ALONE!!!!,"OK, so I thought I was crazy, not being able to make a decent meal with my crockpot. People were making fun of me, ""HOW CAN YOU BURN ANYTHING IN A CROCKPOT""??Now, I look at the reviews on this thing and see that I AM NOT ALONE.I always wondered why people liked food out of a crockpot! Now I know that they are not SUPPOSED TO be like this!!!DO NOT EVER BUY THIS THING UNLESS YOU LIKE SCORCHING BURN GUNK!!!!!On the 10 hour setting it starts boiling within only a few hours!!!!I am trashing mine today!!!"
1,DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT!,"Having had a Rival crock pot for years I purchased this new one two days ago. Today I prepared a favorite meal for friends and came home to a dried out dinner in the pot. I called Rivals 800 number and all they could tell me was to return it. No mention of the loss of a meal and the expenditrue of preparing another meal for my friends. This is the way things are made today, cheap labor produces sub stardard products and the companies who use this type of labor know it and just don't give a hoot.......I will not be purchasing any Rival product again. They really don't care that they make poor quality...."
1,Poor Quality and design,"The programmable feature would be great but the ""low"" and ""warm"" settings are way too hot. The glaze on the ceramic dish scuffs easily and quickly becomes unmanageable to clean as it gets rough. The handle on the lid is not vented and cannot be touched without protection. After 6 uses the plastic handle on the side broke under it's own weight. When the handle comes off screws and a metal backing plate fall inside the casing where there are open contact points. The unit is permanently sealed and had to be cut open to remove the screws and plate to prevent shorting. The lil' dipper that came with it boils conqueso sauce."
2,Too hot!,"I thought it was just me, but after reading the reviews I now understand that there is something wrong with this appliance. I have had it for four years now, and have tried to cook numerous recipes, and they almost always burn, even in a few hours on the low setting. I have always read that you can't get beans to cook fully from dry in a crock-pot, but when I tried it in this one, they went from dry to mushy in less than 4 hours on low. That is just not right!!"
1,Awful,"I agree with the majority of these reviews. I previously owned a 4.5 Q oval Rival that I loved and used for years until I dropped and broke the insert. I got this to replace that one and am so disappointed. It ruined 5 meals before I took it back. All the food was dried-out and burnt way before it was even supposed to be done cooking. The lid rattled all day, letting out moisture and annoying me in the process. I had to ""even exchange"" it because I didn't have all the packaging and stuff. I was hoping I had gotten a lemon, but no, the replacement was the same way. This time they gave my money back. Of course I read these review too late... any suggestions for a crock-pot that works?"
1,Cooks too high,Even on low this crock cooked everything too fast. And after having it for 7 months it burned itself out. I was very disappointed since I liked the size and shape. I will never buy another crock with smartpot since I bought another rival and it's been fine without the smartpot feature. I am not sure if that's what it was or not but I am not taking any chances!
1,hate this thing,"I have two of these after hearing that they were so great from someone on television.They overcook everything. The old fashion crock pot I have that doesn't have the warm cycle never did that.It looks real pretty and heavy duty, but that is where the beauty ends. Don't buy it!"
5,I LOVE THIS CROCK POT!,"Not sure why everyone is bitching about this crock pot. I've owned mine for YEARS and absolutely LOVE it. The timer feature is great, it cooks the BEST whole chicken with about 2 cups of water and the bones just fall off. I could use a new crock for mine after using this no less than 100's of times since mine has a hairline crack, but it's still usable. I'm cooking a chicken in it while I'm writing this review. I've cooked pot roast, chili, beef stew, bbq pulled pork, pork roast and plenty more in this and am happy with the results each and every time. The price is right, I've sure gotten my moneys worth out of it. If your fussy & want to spend more on a different model, go for it. If you want an inexpensive appliance that cooks FOR you, buy this one. I absolutely don't agree with any of the negative reviews that this crock pot has received. So what if it cooks HOT? It cooks a great meal. Mine is well used and well loved! It also cleans up very easy."
1,cooks way too hot,my husband purchased this for me for christmas a few years ago to replace the one I was using from my mom and this cooks way too hot. I ended up going back to my mom's crock pot as at least it won't burn the food. I am extremely disappointed in the product. I wish we could get our money back or exchange it.
1,Way too hot,"You can't leave anything on for too long or it will boil all the liquid out until the inside is a charred black mess. I don't trust it to leave it on its own, but since I can't cook anything on low anyway, I guess it doesn't matter. I own a Rival rice cooker that recently broke within a year of buying it. I am never going to buy a Rival product again."
1,terrible,"I normally like RIval products, but have to say i have never been so disappointed. Every setting cooked basically at the same temp. Boiled on the Warm setting so often items would over cook. The unit started to ""burn out"" early when i would try to turn it on it wouldn't allow me to change setting (ie. 4 hrs vs 8 hr). Then to top it off, it finally did us a favor and the handle brock off. Considering i had utilized my last Crockpot for about 10 years or more and it still works fine..just looks tattered....this crockpot that is only a year or two old is the pits. I do not recommend this unit."
5,I really like this crockpot.,"I've had this crock pot for at least 2 years as of this writing. I use it at least 3 times per month. I like it a lot. I like the timers on it and the size. I don't have to watch the clock and if I am not there when the time is up, it keeps warm so the food does not spoil. I can see that someone may say it over cooks if it has been on warm for some time, but that is not the fault of the pot.The food seems fine to me - never had a problem. I have other rival crock pots. I have an old round one with an unremovable pot from the 1970s, I believe, which still works fine, and a smaller version of this one but without the timers. Rival's products have always held up very well for me. I think they are a quality company."
1,Cracked Crock,"I like the oval shape of the crockpot as most of the meat I cook in it is sort of oblong, but I'm on my third unit in three years as the crock develops cracks within a year no matter how much or how little I use it. Sure, it's guaranteed for a year, but try finding a replacement crock - I've found it easier just to buy a new one. I made turkey soup this Thanksgiving and the crock cracked all along the bottom so I'm shopping for annother unit, and this time it won't be a Rival."
1,ZERO stars - it's a FAST cooker,"I've had my ""slow"" cooker for a couple of years now. I agree with all the other negative reviews. This is NOT a ""slow"" cooker. It cooks everything way too fast. I can't leave anything in for the day and then leave the house and come back to a nice meal, everything is burnt around the edges. It's really a pitty. I will have to get another one. It's great if you want to fast cook something..but it is not what you're looking for if you want a real slow cooker."
2,Cracked Crock,"I was surprised to find that you can burn food in a crock pot, but after reading the other reviews, I agree with the excessive heat diagnosis. I don't leave it alone all day, so that wasn't really a problem.My problem is the cracking stoneware pot. I went searching for a replacement crock, but these reviews convinced me to purchase an entirely new unit. At first, I thought I was sloppy and the liquid in the metal cooking part was my fault. A few more cookings later, I saw the oozing of my food THROUGH tiny spots along hairline cracks in the crock. I did not abuse the unit per the instructions, so I do not feel I contributed to the cracking. Since I can no longer assume my crock can be sanitized, it is headed for the dumpster. It only got 2 stars because I liked the glass lid."
3,very very hot!,This crock pot does the job alright but it only has one tempt and that is hot hot hot. It boils things on warmer! The knob on the lid does not last either. My friend has the same crock pot and we both have had to use a replacement knob. Hers runs hot also. I use it a lot and it has lasted a long time so no complaints there. Just remember that is only cooks on one speed and that is hot!
2,Problematic for people who work long hours,"If you work long days, this crock pot is going to pose some problems. There is no countdown timer, which means that when you leave in the morning you have to turn it on. If you work an 8 or more hour day, this means that food will be overcooked--lots of recipes are for less than 8-10 hours, and unfortunately the ""warm"" setting on this *continues* the cooking. You can't correct this problem with a delayed start using an appliance timer either, because when the pot goes to ""on"" it waits for you to select an *additional* button for temp and time (and if you're not home, you can't press the selection button to start the pot). This is a drag. I'd recommend either a slow cooker with a countdown clock, or one of the old-fashioned slow cookers with a knob and a separately purchased appliance timer instead."
1,lid cracked on first use!!!!!!!!!!,"I bought this crock pot this morning, washed it by hand, and began to cook pasta e figoli (spelling?) not even one hour into it, the lid cracked!!!!!! There were no perceivable flaws before or after my washing it, and I actually heard it crack in the other room! I was extremely disappointed, and will be returning it in the morning!!!!!!"
2,Older ones are better,"I had a Rival crockpot for over 20 years, never had a problem with it until it finally died. I replaced it with this 5 quart model, and I don't like it. If you want to boil meat, chili, or stew, fine. The high and low both boil water. Right now, I'm boiling a corned beef. My old one was a 6 quart, there's a big difference in capacity between 5 and 6 quarts. I have to remove the meat to cook the veggies. Now mine has a crack in the handle, Yay! An excuse to get a new one, but are there any good ones out there? The ovals aren't as deep as the older 6 quart round models (mine had a plastic lid). The lid on this one rattles, unless you wipe the top edge every time you check on the food. I won't settle until I find what I want. Being programable and having a removable pot are nice features.They need to fine-tune the heat, though."
1,NOT so Smart Pot,"After using this only a dozen times or so, the handle became so brittle from the excessive heat of the cooker that it disintegrated. The company says the lid and cooking pot are dishwasher safe, but I think that's a ""crock"" also. I contacted Rival and was told that the item was out of warranty (they go by time, not by how many uses). I figured that the handle could be replaced since it is attached only by a bolt through the lid. But no. Rival does not do that. You have to buy a new lid... and the cost of a replacement lid is $10 plus shipping.... that's about half of what this model now sells for. So beware of this bargain product, because you won't even get what you pay for."
1,Not A Good Buy,"I bought this on clearance and was told it was discontinued. I should have done my homework. I, like a few before me, thought that the overheating was a reflection of rusty cooking skills not the crock pot. WRONG!!!! My first recipe was pulled pork which was burnt to a crisp and practically unable to eat any of it. The second was a roast with similar results. The temperature control simply does not work. I may try for the heck of it to cook something expendible on warm to see what happens (and absolutely if I plan to be in the house all day) before I throw it out!"
1,This Crockpot is horrible,You can't keep anything warm without burning it. I would feel guilty giving it away at a garage sale. Very disappointed in this crockpot.
1,Burnt Crispy,"Everybody at work was telling me, ""you gotta start using a crock pot; they're awesome."" Well, my experience was pretty bad. My mom told me to put some chicken in with a half cup of water, set it to low and cook it 8 hrs because that's what she does whenever she makes her BBQ chicken. When I came home from work, it smelled like the house was on fire. I did not have moist yummy chicken. I had burnt chicken jerky. Now after reading reviews of this ""SMART POT"" I have decided that this pot isn't smart at all but a P.O.S. The outside of the pot was burning hot and the bag of bread that I had sitting on the counter near the crock pot had melted--ruining my chance of even having a sandwich. That night I ordered a pizza and vowed to ruin Rival's creditability and name. So I wrote this review."
1,Poor Service from Rival,"I purchased this product and then, before using it, happened to see all of the horrible reviews here on Amazon. I called Rival to see if they had perhaps remedied the problem of this ""slow"" cooker getting way too hot. Given the over-the-top bad reviews here, I figured they must have had a ton of complaints and maybe had done something about the problem. After waiting on hold forever, I finally talked to a young man who claimed to never had heard of this problem (???) and then mumbled, ""Well, I mean, you know, I'm with the company so I can't say anything bad."" What? What horrible service. There is no way on earth they don't know about this problem. They just must not care. So, I told him, that if they were not aware of the problem then they must not have fixed it so I'd be returning the crockpot. How disappointing!"
1,Ditto,"I doubt that anyone needs another review to confirm that this product is terrible and will burn your food but just in case, here you go: this product is terrible and will burn your food."
1,HOT HOT HOT,"I like many others have had major issues with this crock pot burning everything I make. I lent it to my sister in law for Christmas, ahe has another brand pot at home and hers did not burn at all, or boil. Mine had the same food in it and was boiling and burned the dish. Even on low it boils and burns. I will be contacting Rival now that Iknow that I am not the only one....I would not recommend this brand or unit..."
1,worst ever,"This pot cooks too hot and too quickly. Every meal, no matter what setting I used, has cooked in about 3 hours. In light of the other reviews, I believe Rival should recall this product immediately. There is clearly something wrong with it. If you are among those who have no problems with it, consider yourself lucky!"
1,Way too hot,"Ditto to what everyone else has said about the crockpot cooking way too hot. I didn't return it since I had tried three different recipes. Each one had worked well in my old crockpot, but in this one they were terrible. I threw the whole thing out and bought a different brand."
1,Good idea poor implementation,"When I first saw this, I thought what a good idea to be able to set the cooking time and have it automatically turn to keep warm when time's up.The theory is good but ..... Rival really needs to go back to the drawing board. I've burned everything that I've tried in this slow cooker. Out to the trash it goes and I'll get out my 25 year slow cooker and use it. At least dinner will be waiting for me when I get home and not a charred mess. Don't waste your money -"
1,Disappointed - Rival QC needs to fix this,"I bought this to replace my old Rival Smartpot which had cracked after several years of great service. I was so disappointed with this new one, my food now come out all dry and burnt unless I can be at home and monitor the moisture level in the pot. At first I thought the problem was the lid, which is thinner than my old one and allows more moisture to escape. But having read these other reviews it seems that there is a quality control issue at Rival and some pots just get too hot.I'm here on amazon shopping for a different brand, I will probably either buy the KitchenAid programmable one (twice as expensive but has a nice auto feature that cooks high for two hours then low) or the corningware one."
1,Never ever buy!,"It's absolutely awful! It burns everything you put in it. The lid doesn't come close to sealing, and it rattles and allows steam to escape, resulting in sauces drying out instead of ""juicing up"" as they should. I literally had chicken turn to charcoal when I left it on for 5 hours on low. I would not give this product a zero. I would not want this thing even for free! Don't buy! You will be disappointed!"
1,Way too hot,"I actually feel better reading all these horrible reviews. Everything I'd made in this crock pot was burnt - even when I reduced the temperature by half and/or cooked in less time.I agree with the fire hazard comments. I would not have felt comfortable leaving this unattended.This is my first crockpot so I thought it was user error. Although if I cut a recipe's cook time from 6 hours to under 3 hours and my meal was still burnt & ruined, maybe I should have thought it might be a faulty crockpot.This thing has sat unused for several months in my kitchen. What a waste of money. Now I'll be looking for a better model and will hopefully have some yummy crockpot meals to look forward to."
1,"This is the worst, stay away","This is the absolute worst slow cooker. It gets way too hot, there is no way you can leave the house when it is on, or even ignore it for a couple of hours and do other things around the house. Frankly, isn't that the point of having a slow cooker? I've tried it probably ten times. Soups come to a rapid boil in it and everything else scorches. I literally had chicken [...] turn to charcoal when I left it on for 5 hours (with broth that was covering them). I usually have to turn it down to the keep warm setting which is still hotter than a normal low on any other cooker I have tried. My mother and sister-in-law have the same one and all have had the same experience. All three of us have thrown them in the trash."
1,Horrible! No slow cooking here...,"As the others said it cooks way too hot! It has burned every meal I've cooked in it thus far (each on the low setting)I've never tried the high setting... I'd hate to see what the high setting can do to a meal. If your into chared, burnt & dried up food then this is the right one for you... if not, invest in something better. Don't throw your money (or food) away on account of this."
2,Crock Pot Too Hot,"The temperature (or Wattage) is way too high, I think. Set this thing on ""Low"" and watch it go into a rolling boil in short order. I can't even imagine what ""High"" does. I measured the ""warm"" temperature as 195F after it stabilized. Don't even try to follow a slow cooker recipe with this thing.For what it's worth, it's controls are nicely designed and it looks good on the counter."
2,Not sure yet,I put in a roast at 10am and it is now 2:30 and the temperature is 160 which is really high seeing that it is supposed to be in there until 8pm. I have the round one as well that is the 4.5 quarts and am really worried after reading all of these comments on the product. I put it on the lowest setting and have been checking on it off and on all afternoon. I think that this product does get too hot too fast and that there is a very good chance that the food will be over cooked in it. I think that if you decide to buy this it may be a good idea to be home while it is cooking so you can check on it and be sure you dont ruin your meal. Its to bad that they say it will do something and then it doesnt. I hope you dont fall prey to this as we have. Use only under supervision would be my advice.UPDATE!!I have now used this pot a lot and it is excellent. I really enjoy using it and havent had any problems. Hope this helps.
2,"New to crock-pots, my 1st one:","I got this Crock-pot after my wife read an artical about them and wanted to try. I didn't expect much from them - let me get right to telling you what I experenced. (again this is my 1st ever crock-pot).Controls seemed very limiting, High 4hrs, High 6hrs, low 8hrs and low 10hrs. - that's allSet up some chicken to cook overnight (10hrs low). Next morning I had overcooked chicken stew. Tryed some lamb next, a few shanks at 8 hrs at 5hrs they were overcooked.Now trying chicken stew at 8hrs, It's been 2 and I think it's done already.Pot is too hot to touch the outside, and I am wondering if it is not working properly - perhaps stuck on high.As stated in the above review the lid does not fit the bowl very well and you have to be careful not to leave gaps."
1,Don't buy this!,"This is one product not to buy!. It gets so hot even on the low setting that it burns your food. The outside gets dangerously hot, don't even think of touching it. I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone."
1,burns everything,"I have tried various recipes in this at a Low setting (for < 8 hours), and it has burned everything."
1,Shameful Product,"How is it that such a terrible product is still selling here and elsewhere? I will never buy another product from Rival, not because they made a bad one, but because it's still selling! As almost everyone (who knows how these pots are supposed to work) this unit cooks FAR too hot on it's lowest setting. It ruined a large meal in just a few hours. The meal and the crockpot are in the garbage!Don't think for a second that this issue is overstated. This is a terrible crockpot. Buy something else!"
1,"Agree with others, way too hot",I finally had to look this up to see if it was only me. This is just an awful crockpot. Cooks everything on high.
3,"It's decent, but a fair amount from perfect",Things improved once I realized the thermostat controls were backwards. It works fine for me but it's kinda quirky. Not bad for the price.
1,Burns the bottom of anything I cook.,"I agree with the 67% of people that say this crock pot is a crock of poo. It burns everything on the bottom, even with the lowest setting at only just 2 hours of cook time. I definitely don't recommend this product. I just bought the programmable 7 quart stainless one for $29 at Walmart...$26 less than Amazon's price. I hope it does a better job. Look for my review on that one (SCCPVP700) coming soon."
1,too hot and top does not fit properly,"Very disappointed...I can deal with adjusting cooking time and hi/low temp, however, the top is a big problem. Its too light and rattles and I have water everywhere around the outside of the pot. I put a heavy pot on it upside down to weigh it down and still had water and soup all over the place on the counter around the cooker. The top just does not fit for a proper seal."
4,nice,good stuff. Bu it is too huge for one or two people used. never use it as a full function. usually only have the rice cover the bottom line
1,Hot lid=no good,"The handle on the lid gets way too hot to touch when cooking. I'm waiting for the day (sure will be very soon) that someone picks up the glass lid to check the content and drops and breaks it. Your natural reaction is to drop it when it is too hot for you to take off. For this reason I would NEVER recommend this cooker. Plus the time is set for you. So if you want to cook on low for more than 8 hours while away, you can not. It will go into warm mode automatically."
1,bad,burn baby burn not sure what this would be good for but I would spend a few extra bucks. The insert makes a nice dog water dish
2,Too hot,I read the reviews and noticed some customers writing about high temperatures on the warm setting. I decided to risk it and purchased it at a local store. I used it once and found that the warm setting was WAY TOO HOT! My chili was practically boiling. I returned it as soon as I could.
2,Outside of Pot is Hot To Touch,"Be sure you are very careful with this crockpot - the outside gets very hot and can burn you. Also, the temperature variation described in one of the other reviews is accurate. The older model crockpot is a much better unit. I suggest you purchase a different crockpot."
2,Except for Kim Yun Jin,"A confusing, chaotic Korean thriller that was also ugly-to-look-at despite the presence of Kim Yun Jin (one of the stars of LOST). Yun Jin is very good, as usual, as the desperate lawyer struggling for the release of her kidnapped daughter."
4,A very good introduction to the topic of African music in the African Diaspora,"This was used as a textbook for my ""Diaspora of African Music"" class, and was quite sufficient. It provides a readable and clear analysis of the journey of African sounds that came with the slave trade, into the Western Hemisphere. Here, we get a solid foundation of ethnomusicological analysis and historical and cultural study of how things developed and changed. The author is clearly quite Afro-centric, and it is my opinion that more credit is given to African roots than might be warranted if the folk musics of Europe are considered on an equal plain. However, the careful tracing of the journey taken by the music as it changed into blues, rock, and other ""American"" styles before traveling back over to Africa to be morphed once again into ""Afro-beat"" and other contemporary popular styles of African music, is well done and easily followed.It's a book that I will likely use as a reference in further research."
4,Good CD,"It has a good variety of cumbias and I like the rhythms of most of them. But I think that it should include the ""Cumbia India"" and ""Sonaja Y Tambor"" to be a 5-star CD."
4,"Music's Great, Topix Awful",These guys really are good musicians. I love the tunes and the feel of the words. I had to listen to it a bunch of times. Even though the subjects are nauseating the tunes grab you. They oughtta try their hand on putting out some positive energy and not always sing about shootin up da place.
5,Rydas Bxtch,"Fxck I don't know. If you are a juggalo, and you love ICP, Blaze, and Twiztid then this is a must have. Just like the Cd before its straight up stolen beats and samples with Rydas rappin over it. And just like the one before it, they rapped better then the people who originally did it."
1,You all need jesus,"while all the reviews for this record were quite amusing ("" they jack beatz and make money of them, WHUT!"") theyre all wrong. think about...Myzery with 5 guys who like to paint their face and go around as clowns pretending to be gangsters. Amusing yes....good no.....so, as the fellas below would say...Dizzam! thiz cd is fukkin wack yo! WHUUUT!!!!"
3,Did not work out,"Worked great for about 2 years. It now turns off intermittently and produces loud popping sounds. It is well vented.I am faced with replacing, not a happy camper!"
2,Future dead and curent disabled,Like all new tech ages quickly this sweet unit is showing retirement age in A/v both due to not being able to handle 1080p and defiantly not 3d out of date but still good for an old setup or a non A/v setup ass it a sweet sounding amp and runs dam hot due to it amps but that a worth it for it sound
2,Good only for two years.,"Got mine in Amazon on July, '06.All was fine until a few weeks ago, when the HDMI-out port died. With my components all HDMI-based, losing that port was tantamount to losing the product.I replaced the receiver with a Denon, and all clicked again. Working now with Yamaha to get their receiver fixed - will report here how that went."
4,Interesting shape...,"One of my two dogs really likes this food. The other one isn't interested. The shape of the kibble is very interesting and unique, it is a three dimensional pyramid."
3,So far it's just OK,"So I gave it a 3 just to be fair...I've only used it a few times so far and will update this if I see any improvements (fine lines around eyes and forehead, chest wrinkles (I'm 28 yrs old), also using on stratchmarked areas- thighs, butt) The reason I only gave it a 3 is mostly because it is pretty greasy, doesn't spread well, and doesn't seem to absorb very well. If it does it must take forever! I have been using on my forehead lines and havent had any break out from it yet (but my forehead is the least acne-prone of my skin compared to the rest of my face) If it begins to cause any extra acne on my chest I will update as well but since I just started using it in the midst of a breakout its hard to tell so far. Overall I am glad I got the product and look forward to seeing if I notice any improvement at all with consistent usage."
4,Initially tight-- awesome in the end!,"I love these and have already packed them up to bring out next (and every) October. They look great but do seem to run a bit small. They stretched, though, and are now as comfy as most of my other Chucks."
4,Vitamin E,"Bought these for my mother as she has trouble swallowing most pills. She can just chew these up, and the Chocolate flavor dosn't hurt anything./"
1,Used Batteries,Ordered one battery from BTO Inc and received two! However both were used (visibly scratched up). Neither one would hold a charge. Not worth sending back.True they are OEM batteries but inoperative used OEM batteries.
3,Heavy yet delicate,"It has a very delicate look that doesn't overwhelm a small space, however, the weld on the cross piece between the front legs has already broken and I haven't even used the chair (just moved it around some).When the box arrived, it was so damaged (THANKS a lot UPS!) that you couldn't call it a box anymore. It was more like carboard hanging from my merchandise. Pitiful! It's a wonder the item made it to my house."
4,Well Worth the Price,"This bistro set was exactly what I was looking for. The table is big enough for two people to eat off of without being obtrusive on my small patio. It's not the sturdiest design so I hope it lasts, but the finish is nice and the glass top is of good quality. Overall, definitely worth the $120 I spent."
5,great product,"Great product. Just what we needed for the pool deck. I just tried to order another one, but they are no longer in stock. I hope to buy another one if they become available. fast delivery/"
4,"Excellent performance, but poor sound quality.","This is a set for someone who already knows they like Horszowski and can tolerate a poor recording. If you are a fan, buy it. If you have never heard Horszowski, buy one of his four digitally recorded CDs from Elektra/Nonesuch (sold here at Amazon):ASIN: B000005IYGASIN: B000005IZGASIN: B000005J02ASIN: B000005J0V (his last, and my favorite)If you are on a tight budget, try:Schubert: Trout Quintet, Death and the Maiden / Budapest Qt et al ASIN: B000002773Back to the CDs here:5 stars for performance (no one plays like Horszowski) 2 stars for recording quality (given the time and circumstances when it was recorded, it could be worse)"
5,WONDERFUL,"I was at the Casino San Pablo for this concert and it was wonderful!!! Everyone should purchase this CD because it will take you back to the good old days, and Dennis Edwards did a fantastic job putting this group together. The group member that sing's the lead vocals for ""Rainy Night in Georgia, Lady Soul, and Wish It Would Rain"" sounds just like Ollie Woodson and the late David Ruffin and Brook Benton. He has a great voice and is truly blessed with this voice!!!! Buy this CD. You will love it."
4,Dennis...The Real Voice of the Temptations!,"From 1964 to 1968,The Temptations had an outstanding streak of hits records. David Ruffin, Melvin Franklin, Otis Williams, Paul Williams and Eddie Kendrick had all become music legends.In 1968 Dennis Edwards replaced David (Real name Davis) Ruffin as the new quarterback of the group. During Dennis' tenure, the Temps became even more sucessful including Motown's 1st Grammy Award.Although Dennis is no longer with the group, he still sounds great and has surrounded himself with a group of guys that can really sing. Get this CD. I wish it was a DVD. This is a very good live show. Real fans will agree."
3,a great book,"I bought this book for a friend who came from Columbia to the United States and is expecting a new baby. Not knowing Spanish, I was unsure which book on babies to select. She is thrilled with the book and tells me something new she has learned each time I talk to her. I know it will be a big help when the baby arrives."
1,"The ""Duets"" CD is what I am having problems with and I wonder is anything can be done.",I did receive this order but it was damaged. I can not even listen to this CD. Can you help me to gety my order replaced or something?
1,Don't want to sound like a grump...,"You can read my other review of the other product but both of the Baby Miracle videos, in my opinion, are lame. In a nutshell, these are Baby Einstein wanna-bes without the quality or creativness. I hope I can get my money back! I was (and am) very disappointed.On the positive side, for those of you looking for biblical content with the quality and creativeness, we like the Babyfaith Series. They have three great videos for babies and toddlers.We've tried the Praise Kids and the Baby Good Sports by Kurt Warner - they are okay but not as good as the Babyfaith videos."
1,Very Disappointed,We bought this video and the Creation video for our little boy who is 2 years old. Neither video captured his attention for longer than a couple of minutes. I kept the video running hoping it would get better but I was disappointed to see many of the same images repeated over and over. And some of it looked like amateur camera work--like home video they shot on vacation. The least they could do for the consumer is get enough footage (however bad it is) to fill a 30 minute show. Don't waste your money on this series. There are many other good baby videos out there...BabyFaith and Baby Einstein to name a couple.
1,very disappointing,"This vidoe is so hyped up and yet when we watched it, we were very, very disappointed. I read another review thinking that is was going to be so biblical and it really wasn't.On the other hand, our baby like all of the Baby Faith videos (and books)- God Made Me, God Made Animals and God Made Music. These feel much more professional and really keep our baby's attention as well as give a great intro to the bible."
4,Lovely bedtime book,"This book is perfect for toddlers; it is sturdy, has one line of text per page, and has images that a young child can recognize. My only negative thought about this book is that the touch part of the book is the same texture for each image. Overall, this is a book that a little will enjoy."
3,Good Night,"I bought this book for our new grandbaby. I like the different textures. However, it was smaller than I thought and doesn't have very many pages. It arrived with bowed out cardboard pages and one page was separated a little. It was probably bowed because of the textured fabric which is glued in between each two pages. We don't have a humid climate but maybe it was humid where it originated. My first thought was to send it back but I didn't want to bother."
1,MISLEADING!!,"I bought Good Night because I wanted my grandaughter to own a ""touch"" book; however, all the touching parts are the SAME texture (albeit different colors). What a lack of imagination! How about a little piece of wood or a mirror and how about velvet and sandpaper...this book is not worth a penny!"
5,Good Night nightly !,Wow ! This is the best book ! My 3 yo daughter absolutely loves it and can recite it word for word ! The rhyming helps to remember :-) It has been read so much it is falling apart. She loves being able to touch and feel the animals. You will not be disappointed in this book. I am getting more of them as we read every night and need something else :-)
1,Textures are all the same!,I should have read all of the reviews before purchasing... the lady who gave this book one star was correct- all the textures in the book are exactly the same! There are much better touch and feel books out there- don't waste your time or money with this one.
2,Cute but not a substitute,"I got this because I thought it was just a new edition of ""Good Morning, Good Night"" (same cover and author). However, it is only half of the original book, and the lift-a-flap pages are missing. I am sorely disappointed. The original is MUCH better, spend the extra few dollars."
3,Pale Horse,"The Pale Horse was great. The Unexpected Guest is a little less exciting, but still good."
3,One of the better novel adaptations of a play,We are led astray from the beginning of this novel.The wife of the murdered man is first introduced with the gun in here handas the unexpected guest finds her with the dead man in his wheel chair.Richard Warwick as we meet him through the text is a manthat seems to have deserved his fate. We are tricked into thinking each characteras they are developed might have actually killed himafter it turns out Laura couldn't have.This novel is well done to the twist at the end.For me is seems to lack a little of the pathos the play must have had.
2,Not unexpected results,"As expected, a typical Christie plot twist awaits the reader at the end. But getting there a long, tedious journey. The adaptation of the play doesn't work as a novel and I only stuck with it to see what Christie had in mind. This is easily read with only one setting (as in the play). I won't seek out the other plays-turned-novels.Note: the listing on Amazon for the ""Acting Version"" has many reviews, which mostly refer to the novelization. This is one of Amazon's main annoying points -- books with multiple versions often have multiple listings with reviews, so it's difficult to get a clear picture without a lot of hunting. Amazon's method of listing multiple versions of books also gets 2 stars."
4,The Unexpected Guest,"The Unexpected Guest by Agatha Christie is a considerably good book. Overall, I enjoyed reading it. The tale is of a young women who kills her husband. Just as she is about to confess, an unexpected guest arrives and tries to get her out of her situation. The whole story is about how the two plan to fool the police into not suspecting the young woman. The story has a few twists and turns along the way that are not expected. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes a good mystery.~Jenny"
4,The Unexpected Guest,"This book is a good mystery overall. I could have hoped for a slightly different ending (but that's the romantic in me speaking). It's rather obvious that it was adapted from a play. The majority of the action occurs in one room and there isn't much depth of emotion described in any of the characters.For Poirot and Marple fans, neither of these famous detectives are present. It is still a good mystery and a captivating read. However, I would recommend checking it out of the library or borrowing it from a friend before committing to a purchase."
3,Better than Black Coffee,"Oh, yes. The story is better and the twists and turns are more plentiful with the added bonus of a ""surprise ending"". But I surmise seeing the story unfolding up on stage (as was originally intended) brings quite a different experience to the person than reading about it. On stage the pace can be so quick, the viewer doesn't necessarily has the time to reflect nor the luxury to go back and re-read pages. I say that because the burst of adrenalin the reader gets from the surprise ending comes suddenly crashing down when upon further reflection, he/she realizes that the ending is so implausible.To be truthful, I thought the protagonist was being playful at the end. Pulling her leg so to speak, for what he was saying was just such a joke! Imagine my surprise when I realized the reader is supposed to take his confession seriously! Good drama, maybe. But that does not necessarily translate to a good novel."
4,It was an exciting thriller,Im not usually a big reader but i had to read a book by Agatha Christie for a book report. I liked this book because as soon as I started to read it got my attention. The more u read this book the harder it is to put down. I also enjoyed this book because it wasn't another one of those boring books this book had many twists and turns. I thought i knew who the murderer was at one point and then it took a huge turn and it was somebody else that i'd never think.
3,My faviort book,I am a person who enjoys non-fiction and mystery novels. I think that this book was great. Agatha Christie did a wonderful job on this book. She made it all seem real. As I was reading the book it felt like I was watching it all happen in my head. I like the part when Michael helps Lauren plan a way to keep herself out of jail. She made Michael seem like he has done this type of thing before. The whole book was great. I just love to read books by Agatha Christie.
2,A Disappointing Read,"Being an avid mystery fan and a great fan of Agatha Christie, I was delighted when I came upon this novel. My delight turned to dismay as I started reading this ""novel"". I use this term loosely since it reads more like the play that it was originally meant to be. The book reminded me of a Nancy Drew mystery , which were favorites of mine in the fifth grade. If I ever get a craving for a good old fashioned Agatha Christie mystery, I'll just have to re-read one of her classics, and enjoy watching her plays performed on stage, as Miss Christie intended."
3,Not too bad,"Although this is a story plotted by Agatha Christie, Charles Osborne novelized it. He does a somewhat good job at it, although I felt that ""Black Coffee"" was a lot better. The action is rather slow going. The characters could've been more developped too. Overall, a disappointing, quick read. If you're a big fan of Christie, do yourself a favor and wait for the paperback..."
2,Not up to the usual Christie standards.,"On the whole, I enjoyed this book, but throughout the whole thing I just felt that there should be something....more. I realize this book was an adaption of a play, but even without having known the ending, I figured it out long in advance. Although the plot wasn't as intricately woven as some, all in all it was an easy read that would be good on a rainy afternoon."
3,Slow but good,This was a good book but slow paced.The time period is within two days.The setting and characters are great.The ending was not very complete but this was a good book.
3,"Not bad, but not what I had hoped for","I am a big fan of mysteries and Agatha Christie, but I found this book a disappointment. I know that these are co-authored (to a big extent) by Charles Osborne, and it shows. The story opens with a man entering a house to find a woman standing over the body of her dead husband. He covers up for her. There are lots of twists along the way, but I had the whole thing figured out halfway through the book. I know sometimes you can guess the ending and still enjoy it, but halfway through? I was expecting so much more. Still, it's the best of the Christie/Osborne books so far. Too bad that's not saying much."
3,3 stars,"I am only giving thbis mount 3 stars because the plastic bracket the coves the swiviles on the ceiling is useless. It is suppose to snap in place... no happening. If you are lucky enough to get it to snap in place you better have some glue on it to hold it in place...the mount it self was a good mount. But eithere it hangs down 6"" or 12"" there is no in between. It worked but not would have loved to have a little more height adjustment options."
4,Works,The product works; I just wished it worked longer. I normally put it on at 6:30 am and by 12:30 pm I need to use oil absorbing sheets to dab the oil on my forehead and nose. It doesn't cause breakouts. I'll buy the product again; for sure.
5,Mary Kay Oil Mattifier,I recently purchased this oil mattifier by Mary Kay. I really love this stuff. I have really oily skin and this product keeps the oil away for at least3 or 4 hours then you just need a light touch up.
2,This product did not keep my nose area from getting oily.,I have used this product for about two weeks and I have found my nose area is oily by mid day. i am thinking about returning this product.
1,Disappointed in Texas,I thoroughly agree with all the other reviews on this product!!What a disappointment it was. How did this ever get past the product testing department?
3,Handle fell off the lid,"We've used this for a year or two, mainly for cooking large cuts of meat. The food turns out nicely -- very tender. We cook it on the low temp and haven't noticed that it gets too hot like some people say.However, the plastic handle on top of the glass lid snapped off. With hotpads, it is possible to get the lid on and off without burning yourself too badly, so we still use the crock pot."
1,Very Poor Performance,"I do a lot of crock pot cooking and my old Rival crockpot wore out. I bought this one to replace it and have had nothing but terrible food. The food dries out, burns and cakes to the side no matter how much liquid is added. The cooking temperature is much higher even at the low setting than my old crockpot. I am very, very disappointed."
2,Gotta Get a Different One,"Between my mom and I, we have tried 3 different Rival 38601 6-Quart Smart Pot Slow Cooker, Chrome models. All of them have cooked much hotter than our old crock pots. When I cook in this one, I don't start cooking until afternoon so that our dinner won't be overcooked. Everything always burns in the back and on the bottom. The front of the crock pot cooks better. I'll be returning this one and getting a totally different crock pot. Both my mom and I are very dissappointed in this particular model. I've refered to the manual and followed directions, and it still is not they're best model. I've tested it with boiling water. I can boil water just about as fast in the crock pot as I can on my gas stove! Not much of a SLOW cooker. I use the crock pot 2 times a week. So I am an experienced crock pot user."
1,Horrible Experience,"We purchased the smart pot to replace an older, smaller unit that didn't have the removable liner. After using this unit 4 times and having the same results, we are disposing of it. The temperature control doesn't allow for adjustments. Even on low, liquids boil and the food burns. We have a friend that is experiencing the same problem. We have concerns as to how hot the counter under the cooker becomes. We threw out the receipt and original box so I guess we are stuck with an appliance that we find unusable. We are very disappointed as we use slow cookers regularly."
1,Disappointing,"There are way too many problems with this crock pot. First of all, the lid doesn't fit right even though it might appear to. The first time I used it I came home to a huge puddle of water all over my kitchen counter. The condensation that is supposed to stay inside the pot was bubbling out the sides! Once it gets hot enough to condensate you can fiddle with it to adjust the fit. I have made 3 meals with it so far and it was burned each one in about half the reccomended cook time. This was on the low setting, so I'd hate to see what high does....."
1,Cooks too hot,"I bought this slow cooker and took it back for a refund. It overcooks absolutely everything. It literally boils on Lo. Cannot even imagine using the Hi setting. It is also wobbly (has only three legs) if you don't use the handles but it did not tip over so I think it's reasonaably safe I would keep kids far away from it--it gets very hot outside too. When the electric power goes off, which happens often in Florida in a storm, the timer goes off and stays off. In other words, the unit does NOT restart, as older ""knob-type models"". Your food may be uncooked or spoiled when you return."
1,Once again---A HOT review,"I will say AMEN to all who have complained about this crock cooking too hot. It burns everything. I can't leave it unattended. My first Rival got too hot and the safety fuse thing went off and it has to be sent back to the company to get replaced. I have also e-mailed about this one getting too hot and they are less than helpful. So, do not purchase this crockpot. It is a complete waste of money. I have wasted so much money on food trying to get this item to work. Today, after and hour and a half it burned a $15 roast. I am purchasing a different brand today!"
1,Junk - unless you like burnt food,"I have used an older Crock Pot for years, without any problems. The timer feature looked like a good idea, so I bought this Programmable Crock Pot model. I used it for the first time today, cooking a tri-tip roast on low for 8 hours (I've done this many times in my old C/P. I came home from work to find a crispy critter!! Burnt and all dried out - I'm not even sure the dog will like it (oh, who am I kidding). Apparently, this is a common complaint about this C/P, and I wish I'd done some research first. I am returning this product ASAP, and will go back to my old C/P with the use of the plug in timer. I'm highly disappointed in Rival."
1,Don't waste your money on this one!,"I've been using crock-pots for well over 25 years now and have pretty much mastered the art of slow cooking. In my opinion, nothing is better than getting your meal together before you leave for work, and having it ready to eat when you walk in the door 8 or 9 hours later. However, this is the WORST crock pot I've ever had. If you're not at home to monitor it, your food will be burned beyond consumption when you get home - no matter what setting you choose. The only aroma that will greet you when you walk in the door will be the charred remnants of the ingredients you prepared before you left for work."
1,Worthless and a waste of money!,"This is the worse crockpot I've ever owned. I've cooked several meals in it and they've ALL burned - even on low! I just cooked ham and potatoes in it and it was supposed to cook on low for 10 or more hours. Well, after 4 1/2 hours on low it was starting to burn and dry out! I agree with the other posters about the lid not fitting properly, it's very loose and rattles from the steam. Also the plastic handle on the lid is a lawsuit waiting to happen, it gets so hot. You cannot leave it unattended and any recipe you try cooks twice as fast and usually drys out or burns. Awful!"
2,Disappointed - overcooks/burns food,"I was excited about this product because I wanted to be able to keep food warm after the actual cooking time was complete (I am gone at work all day, so I thought this would be a nice feature). However, I have had the same problem as many others have noted here - it heats up WAY too hot, and ends up burning food or overcooking it, at a minimum. The cheap, lightweight lid rattles constantly during cooking (once it gets totally heated up). I am very disappointed, to say the least. I still have my old Rival slow cooker (got it 20 years ago when we got married), and I think I will go back to using it - it doesn't overcook the food, and has a nice, heavy glass lid that doesn't rattle, let out steam or splash hot water during cooking. I wish Rival would have carried forward the quality of their old models when creating these new models with all the bells and whistles."
1,All of the bad reviews are true...,"I just couldn't resist adding my ""amen"" to all the bad reviews for this product. They are well written. Yes, you too can burn your food within 3-4 hours on the LOW setting. So why would you ever use the HIGH setting? Like food extra crispy?? Save your 50 bucks and keep the old reliable with the knob on the front!!"
1,What happened to the quality?,"I have used Crock-pots for over 20 years with no problems. I bought what I thought was an advanced model only to find out it's more gadget than functional. I too have had to return two units so far because of 1) a misshaped lid, which allowed all the liquid to evaporate, and 2) an overheating unit. Contacting customer service was a joke. I'll be buying from a different manufacture."
1,Fire the designer and the exec who approved it.,"Edited: Apparently they did fire the designer. At least it seems that they have fixed this on the most recent edition of the appliance.This is the worst design I can imagine for a ""smart"" crock pot!! There are only five settings. How difficult would it have been to make all five accessible in sequence. Instead, the ""warm"" setting is not accessible, at all. The input sequence skips it. If you unplug the machine, you have to wait four hours for the warm setting to return. And you can never use the appliance to just keep things warm that you wish to serve at a party, for example.Someone got paid to do this design? Some executive got paid to approve that decision?Someone had to conciously design the input to SKIP the warm setting? Find them and fire them. Universities actually teach design. Or, you might just ask a cook. What happened here? (... sorry for the rant, but this is unacceptable.)"
2,"Cooks Good, but ALL the handles broke!","Well after losing both of the side handles almost immediately after we starting using it, the lid handle broke off after 2 years. The only thing we use this for is potroast, and it comes out great everytime!Using plastic for the handles is stupid. If we had a better handle for the lid I would still love this crock pot. We haven't had the burning issues, but since we use it to cook pot roasts, there is most likely to much liquid for that issue to arrise.I give it 2 stars due to the craftsmanship of the handles. A $60 crock pot should last longer then two years, my mom still has hers from their wedding 30 years ago!"
1,Pot Luck,"I bought this crock pot as a Christmas gift for my wife. She wanted the timer feature so the meals would be warm, but not too hot when we get home from work. Unfortunately, everything we have cooked burns in this crock pot including macaroni & cheese, chili, roast, etc. Tonight, the chili burned and we ordered out for pizza while trying to ignore the charred smell in the house. The crock pot was about 2/3 full, so it was not a small dish. Looking over the other reviews here I suspect the cooking temperature varies significantly from unit to unit. There is no way we could leave anything cooking for 8 hours (as some claim to have done successfully) without burning it. You're gambling with this one. I would choose a more reliable model."
2,Too big and heavy!!!,"Well, it does cook very well and it looks nice, but all our 4-6 serving recipes only fill the bottom 2 inches (unless it is a roast) which makes me think it is just much bigger than necessary. And the weight of it, it is SOOO heavy and it makes my arms and back sore when I clean it in the sink b/c it is too big for the dishwasher and it takes me a long time to scrub residue out of it. I wish I'd gotten the Westbend Alumnimum Slow-cooker b/c it is lightweight and much more multi-functional."
1,"Too hot, Don't buy!","Amen to the reviews that this crock pot burns food. Low produces a rolling boil. There is no way I could leave anything in this pot while at work. I, too, spent the $20 to swap and the replacement unit also burned food. I can't believe this product hasn't been pulled from the market. I will not purchase another Rival product."
1,poor quality handle on lid,The handle on top of the lid broke off after just a few weeks. This is a poor quality product.
2,Weak handles,"Handles on this crockpot are just for looks, they are dysfunctional and they crack from the heat. Once I lifted the pot and one of the handles crumbled in my hand, and the other was cracked and about to break off. Unless, you don't plan on moving the pot around, it is a functional cooker. Also watch out for the steam lifting the lid and allowing water to boil over the pot."
4,works just as expected,"I'm writing to comment about the heat build up some other reviews mention. Yes the Crockpot does get very hot to the touch, except on the handles. I have children too and I talked with them about not touching it and I put it in an area on our counter that they cannot reach. If you're worried about the appliance getting hot - it does and you may want to consider that before buying one."
1,Plastic Waste of Money,The plastic saw guide is useless. I bought a great saw and hoped this device would help me get a square precise cut. I was wrong.
2,Disappointed,I was a bit disappointed with the content of he book. It is overly simplistic and provides little detail about the construction and details of the furniture. The images are roughly drawn line sketches. Save your money. You can obtain a better understanding & more details of the furniture by looking at pictures online.
4,Timeless Classic Pieces,"Important Update - Feb 2013.Recently finished the Morris Chair shown above. Be aware that the measurements ARE INCORRECT for the leg posts cut list. To make the chair look like the illustration (with the arms proportionally higher), add four inches (4"") to the post heights.The book shows 19"" to the underside of arm which IMHO is wrong, should be 23"" Unfortunately my friend and I cut pieces for three chairs from some 1970s used teak from a Kodak plant. So, I docked one star for that error.I bought this book in 2004 and only just used it to make the Morris chair shown above. You definitely need to be an intermediate woodworker to take the raw plans and cut lists from it and build a piece of furniture.From my perspective, to have a catalog of authentic Gustav Stickley plans is invaluable.Nick D. BensonThe National Center for CraftsmanshipFort Collins, CO"
3,"A fun read and good inspiration, but don't expect a ""how to"" book.","The drawings will give you ideas and inspirations for building your own Stickley and mission style furniture, but there are no detailed instructions or guidance of what joints to use where. You better be experienced before trying to build something directly from this book."
3,woodworking book,"I bought this for my husband, he says it is ok. He can use some of the plans, but not all. It isnt as easy to use as I thought it would be. Some of the plans need better explanations. Over all a good book."
2,"Good Design Guide, Bad Construction Manual","As a guide to making funiture for the home craftsman, this book should get either zero or one star. It includes a couple of dozen projects which consist of line drawings, a brief description, a parts list, and minimalist plans - just an elevation or two, poorly done.HOWEVER, these are, by definition, authentic Stickley designs. If you are an intermediate or expert woodworker and a good designer, you can take these plans and drawings and then make your own detailed production drawings.In summary, what you get in this book is a couple of dozen drawings of furniture and some commentary, both of which are of historical value and of interest to the woodworker. Incidentally, I have seen at least two of the designs in some modern mission furniture construction books."
3,"Not really geared for beginning woodworkers,but worth having","What you'll get with this book are some fairly good illustrations of authentic Stickley furniture. You also get a pretty good materials list with each project. You do not get any fully detailed working plans. You'll have to generate these yourself, but the illustrations with each project make this an uncomplicated task if you are handy at drafting or know AutoCAD. Some of the projects have more complete plans than others. Some of the plans might be a pair of dimension elevations, others may include all elevations, plan view and details. From what they do provide, any capable woodworker can build any project within this book. It's not a bad book to have with you if you go to a lot of garage and estate sales. It might help you recognize a treasure unknown to the seller. Fortunately, this is an inexpensive book, so go ahead and order it."
2,Not very helpful if you plan on building anything,The book doesn't tell you how to make the joints. If you're looking for good information on how to build mission furniture look elsewhere.
1,Save your money,"The 62 proects are only a small picture of each final project with couple of drafted views of how the piece of furniture looks from different views. There is a parts list of materials needed, but no help in how to construct the furniture whatsoever. Any magazine or anything else out there has to be better than this. Everyone else has far over rated the book. Instead, subscribe to a good magazine like Popular Woodworking or something like that."
5,Essential,"IDM, electronica, whatever.This collection is fantastic. I admittedly only picked it up Being a My Kill Jack's On completeist, but the other tracks on here don't disappoint. Check out My Kill Jack's on while you are at it. This guy could be huge, unfortunately his last album only got a release of 101 copies! Casino vs japan and BOC fans should check him out."
3,No baby development,"I am disappointed in this journal. This is my second pregnancy and I should have just gone ahead and bought the same journal I used the first time, which is ""The Pregnancy Journal: A Day-to-Day Guide to a Healthy and Happy Pregnancy"" by A. Christine Harris, PhD. Dr. Harris' book is excellent with detailed development of your baby day-by-day, but doesn't have tons of space for writing (which is great if you only want to jot a few things down each week). Dr. Curtis' journal is week-by-week, but doesn't explain if this journal is for the pregnancy time of gestational age or ovulatory age, so I wasn't sure what dates to write in. Each week gives common sense advice on pregnancy in general, not really needed in a second pregnancy. I bought this journal because I wanted more space to write, but I find myself referring to my old journal for the info I really want to know."
3,A game that makes the NFL richer.,"I Bought the game for my grandson,who is a NFL fan.Knowing how the original game is played,I guess I expected some new twists to how it's played.It's the same game with different names,and it's way overpriced.Save yourself $[...] and stick with the original.Hey,with some tape and a few colored sharpies you can make your game whatever you want it to be."
3,"Tired, Dry and Stiff, but complete...","It's always a toss up when it comes to translations of Greek lyric. either you get an edition that is beautifully wrought but incomplete OR dry and complete!Well, that's what you get here! It is as concise and complete as you need it for studying but as art to love and enjoy...the translations by West are tired, monotonous and stiff...I almost like Lattimore's stiff translations of Greek lyric more!The print is also un-aesthetic and poems are so close next to each other (in order to fit them all), that it strains your eyes to read them.A useful text for people in school but not for those to be truly inspired by...though I wish I could say the opposite."
3,"Oh please, do some research.","This item in all likelihood was an officially licensed release (for the Malaysian market, through FOX Australian, or so I've read). There's all the right copyright information stamped all over it, and all the episodes have their credits roll intact. If you've ever seen a bootleg anything, the first thing that you'll notice is missing is the credits roll--wasted disc space. The quality is decently high for a VCD."
1,bologna,"This has to be the most crap I have ever read in one book. The only reason I finished the book is because I was using it in a paper. Basically, the author makes up a bunch of bologna excuses as to why some women were still wanting to be house wives during the 1960's. ""Because they have a fear of independence"". Well, to be quite honest, it isnt just women who are scared to be on thier own. Men, get scared too when they are having a hard time making house payments and they are raising children all alone (which the author was doing). The majority of people DONT want to be alone, its human nature, but that doesnt mean that we have a ""hidden fear of independence""... it just means that we want a companion to share life's troubles with. I hate to sound like a 4th grader, but this book is dumb and i wouldnt reccomend it to anyone unless i wanted to torture them for some sick reason."
2,Waste of time,"This book is not very motivating for a generation x woman. ""A Woman's Worth"" is much more energizing. The author's perspective is even outdated. After reading half of this book, I put it away because it became too annoying. More suitable for baby boomer."
4,Interesting,"This is interesting to read, although I don't know if it's very good advise, some of it is useful but some of the advise may be detrimental to a relationship."
4,An unusual book,"I loved her later book The Wasted Vigil. This one feels like a beginning. There are too many similes, though each individual simile is often beautiful or apt. The story gives you a real feeling for the first and 2nd generation Pakistani immigrant experience in Great Britain. She is a wonderful story teller, while teaching about modern Muslim practices, and difficulties and pleasures."
1,"Dull, unimaginative","I found the book engaging in the beginning, but as the painfully constructed story line started to unravel, i was left wondering if i had gotten hold of a torture device used in interrogations. There was certainly nothing original about the story line ( Desi immigrants are a done to death theme), the characters were soul less and unconvincing, the passages were painfully long.It seemed like the author had started walking in a corn field and mid way forgot where he was and what he should do next.A HUGE disappointment"
3,Maps for Lost Lovers,"Sadly, badly written. However a look into the horror that is the abuse of Muslim women all contained in the laws as stated in the Koran. Tis time for them to burn their burquas and their jihabs and enter the 21st century. How can any ""holy"" book prescribe the humiliation of the ""weaker"" sex. Shame on it and shame on the chauvenist males who pursue the practices!"
2,(Ancient),"This is a truely talented rapper. He can be keepin it at a cool an calm flow, and then take off like high powered magnetic retraction. His true talent shines through on the verses he's ripped with the Hypnotize minds label. Although this cd's got little to no sign of that shine. And thats because this album consists of very old material. There's around four good tracks, but only 2 of them have exceptional bass. I guess he was just giving his diehard fans something to chew on, while he starts his new label. I know there gonna come hard as hell, when the compilation called Kamikaze inc. debuts. So if you wanna hear the real MC MACK, either check out his flows with Hypnotize, or wait till he deploys his entire clan on the release of his label's initiation."
4,Far better story than i anticipated.,And my son was one of the 3D stereo artists who converted the 2D movie to 3D. We enjoyed it.
2,Bleh...,"I wouldn't recommend The Smurfs at all, it just isn't really that good of a movie. It isn't even decent. There are a couple funny parts, but those laughs only last for a second and then they're gone, leaving the whole rest of the movie boring and dull. This just isn't a good movie... -Trent Foreman, Author of Nightmare"
1,"Hated it, the kids thought it was okay.","I took the kids to see this, I wished I had waited to see it on video. I thought it was painful to watch, I can't remember being so irritated at a movie I just couldn't wait for it to end. I liked the smurfs as a kid but these smurfs were strange and not what i remembered. I'd let the kids watch it for free, but don't pay for it."
5,great show,This was a gift for my daughter. The whole family watched it and we all had a great laugh. It was very enjoyable to watch.
3,Entertaining,Good but the storyline was a bit predictable. Nice movie for younger children - older ones will find it a bit ... predictable! :)
4,The Smurfs movie,and Neil Patrick Harris - how could it not be enjoyed? Loved seeing the little blue guys in action again. :-)
1,Can't Watch in 3D Because I don't have a Digital Display,"I understand the blu-ray industry is just trying to protect against piracy, but all they suceed in doing is alienating legitimate consumers like myself. I actually purchased this movie and because my 3d projector uses an analog VGA display input I cannot watch this movie at all. My power dvd comes up and says my tv must have a digital input like dvi, hdmi, or display port. If this is the future of digital high definition video then I'm just going to start pirating all my HD video's rather than purchasing them legitimately."
5,Great with Kindle Fire,I bought this to go on my kindle fire for a long car trip on a vacation for my daughter to watch. It was great. They are instant on the kindle fire and I downloaded it for her to watch offline while we were in the car. It downloaded surprisingly quick too. Then I was very happy to find out my xbox 360 had an amazon instant video app on it. So now my daughter watches it on our tv through our xbox also. Worth the money compared to buying a dvd. And the movie is super cute!
2,best sleep i've ever had....,"I am giving this movie 2 stars just because I've had the best sleep ever while watching this movie....it was so boring, it put me right to REM sleep."
2,Ultraviolet is miserable,"I don't write reviews however the misery of the Ultraviolet ""digital copy"" inspired me.The movie is great, kids love it, etc. Ultraviolet is a joke. The download is in a proprietary format and as far as I can tell can only be played using Sony's media player. Sure you can stream it but how do the kids watch this movie while we're in an area of poor cell reception or on a flight?Do not buy this if you want a true digital copy!"
2,WARNING: DVD doesn't play in many players,"Very good movie, with great animation and a good cast. That is, if you can get the DVD version to play; seems it won't in some DVD players. Tried two separate copies in our Toshiba and Philips players, which handle anything else."
3,Not For Grown Ups. But Not Bad For Kids,"I'm not going to lie to you- this movie was a bit of a pain to watch. It's not a surprise that I'm not a big Smurf fan. That said, the group of kids I watched it with loved it. They thought it was an amazing film. You might not think that. But the little blue guys have staying power."
1,The Smurfs Review,This is the 1987 film:Masters of the Universe all over again. They both have the same stupid storyline. The only difference is that Master of the Universe was made at the height of the shows popularity. This film was not. The acting is not that good. The subplot is ponitless. It doesn't know which age group they trying to appeal too. Neil Patrick Harris and Hank Azaria were wasted in this film. It's not funny at all. The Smurfs song is annoying. The only good thing about this film is the CGI. AND YOU THOUGHT THE LAST AIRBENDER WAS A BAD FILM!!!! I give this film 1 out of 10.
2,Not so Smurfy!!,The first 20 minutes of the movie was actually great but when the smurfs arrived in New York it started to all go down hill from there! I didn't know whether the movie was about the Smurfs or Doogie Howser!!! How convenient was it that Gargamel happened to find an abandon warehouse with everything in it that he needed to conjure up some evil spell against the Smurfs!? This movie was full of recycled material already seen in Alvin & The Chipmunks!! Not impressed with this television remark! I would rather watch paint dry!
1,Very Angry,"the copy I received did not have the digital copy...I will try and return it, but I doubt I will have any luck"
5,Fun movie purchased on amazon,"Fun movie! My daughter loves it, and could watch it over and over again! Great combination of actors and animation!"
4,Amazing Graphics,I found this movie on Netflix and decided to buy it to be able to share with other people. The graphics and digital enhancements are absolutely phenomenal. The most amazing detail that I saw through out this movie was the interaction between graphic and actor didn't seem out of place.
4,Excellent movie.,"I grew up with the Smurfs, and personally wasn't to keen on watching the movie, much less buying it. However, my kids loved it, and I broke down and bought it as part of their Christmas gifts. I'm glad to say the movie was better than I thought it would be for a live-action based on cartoon. I enjoyed very much."
4,"Great movie, but seriously lacking 3d!","This was a wonderful movie! The smurfs look great, and Gargamel was spot on. Neil Patrick Harris did a spectacular job also. The voices for the Smurfs were perfectly cast. Everything about this movie I loved, until I put in the 3D blu ray. There were maybe there spots in the whole movie where the 3D was noticeable. There was hardly even any depth to the movie. Even my kids were dissatisfied with the 3D and they are 7 and 5. Most of the 3D showed up right at the very end of the movie. If you are looking for a good family movie, this is it, but if you want a good family 3D movie this is not, try Madagascar 3 or The Lorax, both them were great! So if you want this movie get the Blu Ray version, you get The Smurfs Christmas Carol disc with the regular blu ray, but not with the 3D version."
3,"Good, but didn't quite capture the cartoon's magic","As a child of the 80s, I was a big fan of the Smurfs and was excited when I heard they were making a movie. And as the movie stands on its own, it's an okay kids movie. The cast is great and the animated smurfs are cute. But it didn't reinvigorate the same magic that the cartoon held. A few things bugged me, like the fact that they planted the smurfs into current-day NYC, the voices of the smurfs were not as easy to distinguish as in the cartoon, and while I love the cast, I didn't feel as though Neil Patrick Harris really connected with his little blue co-stars, although he did a fine job. Azrael the cat too is played by a real cat, with a few animations added and just ended up looking silly. I would have rather seen a movie completely in 3D animation, no live actors, and set in the smurf village and forest. All in all, an okay movie but not for the smurfy at heart."
1,they send me normal dvd not 3d movies I was so mad I whant a discount on the dvd is not even a bluray.,and they still putting on the 3d bluray that they have but they don't the just want to sell I am so!!!!!!!!!!!!! mad.
5,My son love this movie,He have watched this movie on our kindle over and over. Anything that he enjoys is alright with me. Thanks
3,Not a lot like the cartoon.,"Good kids movie. I loved the smurfs as a kid, so I was disappointed it was more like a smurf docu-drama.For more smurf fun, try the iTouch / iPad Smurf villiage app."
5,This is smurftastic!,My granddaughter and I love the movie and are waiting for the next one! Great family movie! Not a bad word in the whole movie!
4,smurfs,"What am I suppose to write it was a good movie ,My daugther loved this movie she is 12 she is the one who wanted wanted this Smurf movie ,she seen it at the movies with her grandma."
3,THE SMURFS,"CAN'T SAY MUCH ABOUT THIS AS I HAVE NOTWATCHED IT YET, MY DAUGHTER SAID IT WAS GOOD, SO I WILL HAVE TO SEE. IT DOES HAVE NEIL PATRICK HARRIS IN IT, AND I DO LIKE SOME OF THE MOVIES THAT HE HAS BEEN IN."
1,A Dis service to a great franchise,"I thought this movie was just AWWFUL. It takes away from what the smurfs are and mean to a bunch of 80s saturday morning cartoon watchers. It's just another franchise that hollywood destroyed. The 1 star is for the special features. I actually rate this movie a 0, but the special features were worth the rental off netflix. It started pretty good but when they went into the city, it was terrible. in short I would not rent or buy this. Maybe rent off Netflix, that way it's free and no money is spent on a garbage movie. All smurf fans should rent this to see how it is, but DON'T SPEND ANY MONEY ON IT! The Chipmunks movies were alot better.SPECIAL FEATURES2 CommentariesA documentary Smurfs from Comics to screen.A Smurfs Christmas Carol {Which isn't on this Blu-Ray}and more.They did a OK, job on the features but that's all I can say that's positive other than the beginning of the film."
2,Awful,"I thought this would be a really fun movie to take my five year old to since The Smurfs was my favorite cartoon when I was about her age; but it turned out that I could barely sit through it. I am not a picky movie goer. I can sit through almost anything that is not gory. But this movie was so boring and and the ""comedy"" so contrived that I felt embarrassed for the writers. What's the word?... CORNY! That's it! This is the CORNIEST movie I've ever forced myself to sit through. The villain was particularly annoying in that regard. The animation was kind of neat, though not nearly as good as I had anticipated, and my five year old seemed to like it okay though and laughed at a few of the jokes, so that is why I gave it two stars."
2,Reverse Tylenol,"Raja Gosnell must be stopped. Hanna-Barbara made amusing cartoons for children. Movies based on Hanna-Barbara cartoons aren't half as amusing, but they're ten times more nauseating. Gosnell doesn't get it. First he gave us the lanky-brained ""Scooby Doo"" movies, and now this, an adaptation of the most obnoxious, hackbrained Hanna-Barbara cartoon, with the obnoxiousness and hackbrained quality of the small-screen TV series multiplied to fill the Big Screen. It could have been worse, and children, especially younger children, do seem to enjoy most of it, which is simple slapstick and nonsense jokes. But aren't we above this? Aren't our children above this? Pixar makes perfect films for children, films encouraging thoughtfulness, films about emotion and humanity. This is one of the many modern children's movies that are just adult films dumbed down to a childish level, with all the life cut out. On the upside, Katy Perry voices the Smurfette."
1,not good,"This was a giant mainstream advertising ploy with smurfs running around in the background, watching the old cartoons is a better choice"
4,Better than I thought it would be.,"Appropriate and interesting script, humor and skits for all ages. No adult allusions to concern a parent about. Animation detail and motion was good, but not great. Certainly not as varied or refined as what was found at, for example, the ""Rango"" level. A bit of unique personality came through for each Smurf character although some Disney dwarfs style stereotyping was present. Quite good acting from our human characters especially Azaria as Gargamel. Storyline was just unique enough to hold your attention although the idea of mythical creatures coming through some sort of space/time warp into our world, humorously trying to acclimate themselves and then trying to find their way back, has been done often enough.Summary: Good entertainment value for this genre for all ages."
3,cute movie but didnt really keep my kids attention,Was a cute movie but didn't really keep their attention other than on the animated parts. More of a buy it later when its discounted price or just borrow it from a friend instead. Not a movie that is a watch multiple times. Just a once a year on a small urge to do it
1,Why did they have to do this?,"This movie is crap. The plot is silly, and the acting is terrible. Why did the Smurfs have to come to Central Park, of all place? Why couldn't this have been a CGI movie that took place in the Smurf universe? Having them come here to our world was completely unnecessary, and the subplot regarding the advertising campaign was utter nonsense. It was like Hollywood took one of its cookie-cutter movie plots and added Smurfs and real people to the mix. This movie was the same as Alvin and the Chipmunks, except with Smurfs. Total, utter, intense crap."
1,BORING MOVIE,"Very cheesy movie,so boring i had to turn it off, my son wanted it turned off quickly and said it was stupid and boring....They ruined a classic cartoon, piece of crap movie"
1,"Not sharp, wouldn't cut butter!","This knife is so dull, right out of the package, that it wouldn't even cut butter! Pass this one by, spend a bit more, and get a better quality knife. I ended up buying a ""Diamond"" brand knife and it it sharp."
5,Vitamin C,My whole family takes Nature Made Vitamin C. It helps us to avoid colds. I have been using Nature Made Vitamins for years. Amazon has the best price.
4,Satisfied Customer,It is the second time I buy this product without any problems. The product delivered as descibed. The only problem is that the expired date is too short (end of december 2012) for this number of vitamins (300 pcs). You must take more than 1gr vitamin C per day in order to finish them on time!!
1,Country of origin,"With so many products being made in China, we must demand that the country of origin be made available."
5,Vitamin C,"Since I cannot have citrus now, I needed a source of vitamin c and am quite satisfied with this brand. I have used it for a couple of years and whether or not it can be attributed to this vitamin, I only get one cold each year and even work with the public in retail. I will buy it again and continue to use it."
3,Vitamin C. l000 Mg tablets (3 pack),"I received the product in a timely fashion, but the expiration date on the pills are December, 2012. Three hundred pills........I'm not going to go through the bother and expense of returning them......but I'm going to have to give away some.It's disappointing. I thought I was getting a great deal. I would have done better if I purchased these at a store."
4,A good buy,We bought this mainly for the price getting a better deal having a three pack and enjoying the needed vitamin C
5,Muy bueno,El mejor interprete del genero. Muy buena la produccion Peron muy dificil de superar al Mambo cibernetico. Richard Cepeda que Dios te bendiga y tira otra pronto.
4,Intriguing,What is the politics/relationship between the Disney Co. and the Orlando community?Find out how community leaders in Orlando persuade the Disney Corp. with city projects so that they will thrive their business there. It's interesting how the Disney Corp. was protected from government regulation and more.
1,Mold,"i dont know whats going one here, but i uploaded a photo of my can of sardines, all molded, and caused me to vomit"
4,Found again,"I used to read this to my children and haven't been able to find the book. Now I have it to share with my grandkids.It's so much fun I don't know why more books haven't done similiar things. It's a great ""starter"" book for other books with hidden objects in them."
4,Very Insightful Book on Emperor Hirohito's Life,"I picked up this book in Acres of Books, a venerated used bookstore in Long Beach (since 1934 - three generations of owners) which will be going out of business soon. I really enjoy the book along with its insights into the Japanese character. It has a studied, academic quality but still makes for lively reading. There are numerous quotes from other sources such as the newspapers from the Crown Prince Hirohito's visit to Europe in 1921. These were tumultuous times in Japan with the Meiji restoration only fifty years before when Japan vaulted from its medieval to a modern nation.I am researching for a novel set in the period just before World War II, in the thirties so it's an invaluable resource."
2,Thinking Tarot: Be Your Own Reader and Advisor,"On the whole, a disappointing book and CD. Having never used software for Tarot, I was very disappointed with the CD. The spreads shown and the interpretations are very generic and never is the user guided on how to read the cards as a whole, or come to a conclusion. That's the hardest part of reading Tarot. One needs to be able to read the cards as a movie film the querent's life. This CD won't help in that area.On the bright side, the author talks about the ""language of Tarot"" as symbolism. Not many books are detailed in symbolism of the cards. This one is pretty detailed in that aspect.I have many books on Tarot and I feel there are many out there that are better for beginners, such as the Eileen Connolly series, or the books by Rachel Pollack. This one is OK as a reference, but if you are building a library, this isn't an essential."
4,Only rated 4 because of CD not viewable,"I just bought this book - CD still sealed, I have XP and it won't work I followed the link the authorsuggests here but it is no longer available, I went to the publishers site it's not available there soI went to the Authors site n the book & it is no longer available either, rather disappointing reallyas the book is great and I've tried every possible way to find how it will open on XP as the Authorclearly states here it willI would hope he will see this and update the information - Book so far looks A1"
2,Could have been good,I tried installing this with windows 98 with no luck. I followed all the information for email contact and download to fix - no luck. Can't contact by email or get correction by download. I'm taking it back. I have better books than this on the tarot but was hoping the CD would be useful. Forget it!
1,Disappointing.,"A tour EP, and a generous one with a running time of over 40 minutes, a blessing or a curse depending on your threshold for challenging music. Sadly, there is nothing resembling a song on the EP, gone is the Beatlesque pop of ""Cubist Castle"". Instead the listener is assualted by a lo-fi sonic jumble of theremin, processed clarinet, violin and Casio VL Tone. The band has abandoned the soothing, backyard ambience of ""Explanation"" for dated avant garde posturing: electro-acoustic jams, Reich-influenced spoken word phase experiments and dully academic musique concrete compositions. The EP's brightest moments are reminiscent of Ralf and Florian's pre-Kraftwerk experimentalism, but there are simply not enough ideas to sustain anyone but the most indulgent of listeners. Recommended for only hard-core fans and completists."
1,Just plane pitiful!,"I got this game, hoping it was living up to the Fighting Fantasy series (no kiddies, I didn't mistype it, it's FIGHTING FANTASY not FINAL FANTASY :P) and man, I was going 60 through Hopesville, then 150 mph going out of displeasedville! Deathtrap Dungeon, the gamebook, was never like this! I hate it more then I hate anything! I wished I could say, jup, very RPGing, and sticks to the story... But I will hammer my fist once on the table of Shame and say NEIN! This is just pathetic!And to top that, I have to rate with 2 stars instead of 0 XD"
3,Could have been better,I liked the story and the graphics weren't that bad but the main problem was with the controls and the camera angles at times. If not for that this game would've been great.
1,Deathtrap is horrible!,"From the company that brought you classic games as Tomb Raider and Fear Effect, Eidos Interactive brings to you: Deathtrap Dungeon. A game that they shouldn't have even put their name on. This game sucks from start to.... well I never even got past the first level because this game is that horrable. Graphics - I've seen better looking dungeons for the 8 BIT Nintendo then in this game. The graphics are so grainy, my eyes started to hurt after only 10 mins of playing. The camera angles are very slow and choppy. I don't see how anyone would think this game looks good.Sound - There is no background music (at least not in the first level) and the sound effects in general or just plain bad. The control is by far the worst part of Deathtrap Dungeon, but I won't get into it, because I'm only aloud a maximum of 1000 words... LOL. Bottom line is - this game isn't even worth the $2.50 to rent."
2,Not what I had hoped for.,Didnt like the playability of this one. Graphics are decent though. Would give this one 2 1/2 stars.
2,Sharon has failed us.,"The plot line starts out to be interesting, but the ending is boring, predictable, and not truly an ending. Who dunnit? We really don't know."
3,jewelry roll,It was what I was looking for I just wish it had more room for pierced earings and more pockets.
4,It is what it is!,I am very satisfied with the keychain. It came in a nice box and velvet protector. It looks just like it does in the photo and is holding up well considering I drop my keys often. I would recommend this product to others.
1,Not what I spected,"Not worth buying this parts. This are Japannesse THREE FIVE brand parts in a MOOG box, and the actually cost double than the THREE FIVE, just beacause of the box they came in"
2,Typical Modern Ambiguty,"This is a verbose introduction that manages to even waffle on whether the Virgin Birth was an actual happening or some super-spiritual nonsense a la Raymond E Brown at his worst moments. Not overtly heretical, but doing the dance with uncertainty that paralyzes the faith of many. You'll be better off with Peter Kreeft's 'Catholic Christianity'."
3,Decent...,"This is a decent quality money clip. You can tell that over time, it will lose its ability to squeeze the money/cards in it tightly.I would still go back and buy it again though because it was just $13 and I got free shipping on it. I'm not sure I would buy it for more than $20 though because there are better money clips out there for the money."
1,Money Clip,"I bought this as a b-day present for my fiance to replace one that he had lost. From the image on the site it ""appeared"" to be identical to the lost one. When it arrived it was actually smaller in length than a normal money clip and the back is open which I found strange. I ended up buying another one for him and I have yet to return this one-maybe I will give it to someone else?"
1,Very Poor,This item cost alot of money but is a piece of crap. Don't expect to put alot of money in this because it won't hold it. My clip broke after a week. Don't buy this item you can find better ones for a lot less money.
2,Water leaks out from under the lid,"This Rival crock pot is my third or fourth crock pot. All of its predecessors eventually stopped working. However, none of them experienced the problem I discovered when I first used this model: The lid is too light to keep water from building up around the edge of the pot. Eventually the lid begins to float on a layer of hot water around the edge of the pot. I had to keep mopping the water away from the rim of the crock pot in order to keep it from overflowing onto the counter--and that water was hot, as it was condensing from steam. I was using the low setting, so I'm not exactly dying to find out how fast the water builds up when I set it to 'high.'The next time I use this pot, I'll try setting some kind of weight on the lid. If you purchase this model, beware of hot water leakage, and adjust for the fact that whatever you are cooking in the pot is going to be a little drier than you might have expected because of the escaping water."
1,TOO HOT!!!!!,"Had the water problem as stated by other consumers. Waterpuddle in front of slow cooker and on the floor. Slip and falldanger. Not a small puddle at all.ALSO MAJOR temp problem. On LOW, my meat cooked in about half the time. 6 hours (3.5 lb. pot roast) recipe was for 10-12 hours. The warm feature was set by the manufacturer,still continued to cook my meal. Dangerous situation to say the least.The Hot temp on low and the water spewing everywhere happened with 2 different Rival pots. returned both.,"
1,DO NOT BUY,"Same as what the others are saying. It bubbles over and makes a giant MESS every time I use it. Even though the pot works, I have to buy a new one because the mess is so extreme everytime I use it."
1,Steer Away - Cooks Way Too Hot,"As indicated by a number of other reviews, this unit runs way too hot. Recipes that call for 8 hours are typically cooked in 2, even on the low setting. I'm very disappointed with this model."
1,"Lid leaks, spatters, and sputs. Horrible!","Rival should take these off the market and if there customer service is so poor by wanting to replace this model with the same model, I wouldn't even purchase another Rival no matter what the model is."
1,Do not buy!!,This thing is a fire hazard. It gets so hot it cooks off all the liquid. Even on low the water boils out and collects around the unit making a big puddle. The outside gets so hot on low that if you were to touch it it would burn you. I cannot belive this unit has not been recalled. What ever you do dont buy this model crock pot!
2,Gets too hot on outside.,"This is a typical crock pot. However, the outside of the pot gets hot enough to burn you badly. The handles stay cool, but I don't like the surface being so hot with kids around. It's not for me."
4,"Good, but a little dated. Worth the price though....","These are VERY useful DVD's that cover a wide range of home improvement/repair subjects, as well as two that specifically deal with woodworking projects.They are designed to build your skills, not only for the projects in the videos, but beyond as well.I reduced the star rating to four-stars because much of the material and methods are somewhat dated... as are the shows themselves. For example, all of the joinery demos in the woodworking section are primarily dowels, whereas there are much better solutions for joinery today including biscuits, pocket holes, dovetails, and more.Nonetheless, the DVD set is well worth the price, and recommended."
3,"Good size, not very fat (thick)","This was a gift for my daughter for Christmas - all she wanted was a Panda Bear. We got it and it is okay. It is made very well and looks very durable. It will sit up like the picture. However, the picture makes it look like it is fat and fluffy and it is not. It is actually pretty skinny through the body. I thought it would be fuller. The head is full but the body does not have a lot of fill in it."
4,Love it,We hung this from my son's ceiling and he placed stars and such all around it. This is not easy to hang up really and it is pretty cheap feeling but it does look awesome hung on the ceiling. Great buy for any future astronomers!
3,What did you expect for 10 bucks?,"When you purchase an item less than 20 dollars you aren't going to get something as durable and solid and awesome as you expected.As for the hanging from a ceiling...Don't use tacky stuff...that's obvious. Use fishing line and one of those tiny hooks, matbe even a small screw.If it is so light weight and cheap, then it obviously wouldn't require a screw, but it does. These planets are awesome for someone on a budget...Kids love them, and THAT is what matters...the KIDS. Thanks"
2,"No Sun included, don't glow enough","Was disappointed that the Sun was not included, and the planets barely glow at night. Was a bit disappointed with the kit. Still, my son has fun seeing the planets and learning all about space."
4,Fun for Younger Kids,"I bought this for my 12 year old son and it's a little too ""young"" for him. It's a good product and very durable. He is definitely having fun with it, but I would have bought it for my 8 year old instead of my 12 year old."
5,Great product!,"Bought this for my 5 year old son. He is very interested in the SS and loves having these in his room. Easy to put up. Glow in the dark feature works great. Came with a little info to get him started, he now is able to name all of them and tell you a little about each one. Awesome!"
2,Not worth the money,"We have been completely disappointed with this set. Our boys (ages 3 and 5) received it as a gift...and I certainly hope the purchaser didn't pay $20! The planets are flimsy plastic balls in two pieces. They are various sizes, but are NOT remotely to scale. The fishing line and tacks are tedious to assemble. Gift buyers should be SURE the recipients want to attach nine planets to their celing with tacks and extra adhesive putty (not everyone does!). We would much rather have a cool mobile where the planets could rotate around a sun (which is missing from this set). Ours is going in the trash soon."
5,I want one too,"My daughter got one of these but never showed much interest, so we hung it in my 4-yo son's room. It was so cool, the planets glow really brightly and in different colors....Jupiter is kind of red and neptune is blueish. I take every opportunity to go in his room and watch these, I want my own set. Now all I need to do is convince my wife.Very cool toy."
5,My review,"These glow in the dark planets are beautiful, easy to assemble and absolutely stunning when glowing. My family and I just lay there and gaze at the stars and planets while we talk and laugh together. I absolutely recommend this toy to anyone who wants to enjoy glow in the dark planets."
3,Just okay,"My son mentioned he wanted a solar system to hang from his ceiling...so I looked and looked and settled on this one. Simple yet educational and easy to set up. This could have probably been purchased at the dollar store. Nothing to it really. My son was excited to read about the planets. And it looks okay hanging on the ceiling (better than up-close), so no major complaints."
2,The last time I checked...,"The last time I checked...the universe had a sun in it. Also, the planets come with tacks to hang them up with. The instructions say to tie the line around the tack but this is very hard to do. The tack is of the flat push variety so there's nothing to really tie it around. There are much better options available"
3,Nice product.,I loved the thought of the glow in the dark 3d planets. Which I have not tried to hang yet or even see if they glow. Mainly because when I received them 1 was broke still havent heard from the company trying to resolve that issue. But they are very thin & not very durable. But there cute. And I just hope they send me a new Neptune & they work when I do hang them.
1,Cheap cheap cheap,"We received this toy as a Christmas present for our two year old who loves anything space. Whoever design/manufactured this toy should be embarrassed. It is made with the cheapest plastic possible, the planets are painted in bizarre/inaccurate colors and the pieces fall apart very easily. They glow in the dark ok but there is no way I would ever hang such a lame toy in my son's bedroom."
4,Solar system,The only thing missing is the sun but they do glow in the dark. Could have been more clearly marked.
3,kinda pricey...,"for what you get. I bought this for a school project for my 4th grader. It did the job but I was a little disappointed in the ""stars""."
1,disaster!,"i thought it comes as a whole, you have to bring it together yourself, and you have to bring the even planets together, they come in two pieces, thin plastic, some of them even doesn't close properly. waste of money, bought it for my niece, now I ll buy another one from another brand, bcos she is very disappointed, and she now wants solar system!!! DON'T BUY!"
1,No Sun No Solar System!,You can't very well have a solar system without a sun and this product does not have one. Ridiculous!
3,Educationally interesting,"My 4 year old grandson received these for christmas. I hung them up and it was only a very short time that he was naming all the planets. They glow for a long period at night after the lights are out. He loves them, however; they were also suppose to come with stars, santa forgot them. So its very disappointing when you order from the internet and everything is not there. The box was burned so I have no way to try to get them. You really need to inspect packages, you take a chance when ordering on-line"
1,Poor quality,Cheaply constructed. Barely glows. Even purchased a black light and it is still dull. Don't waste your money. Total crap.
3,what is a solar system,"great planets, nice sizes, in scale to each other. Plenty of stars . . . BUT why do we call it a SOLAR SYSTEM? We call it a solar system because the planets revolve around the SUN. This kit has no sun!!! I am currently looking for an in-scale sun"
3,Difficult to assemble,Difficult to assemble. The manual is kind of messy and confusing. Impossible to hold on a hard ceiling due the fragile tacks that comes with it.Beautiful and shinny at night.
3,Thought it would be better,"I was a little disappointed w/the stars. You get a sheet of stickers that look like you could've gotten them at a craft store for $3. They aren't like the raised stars you probably have seen before but they do the trick in my son's room. He really likes them. The planets are flimsy but do the trick as well. If i were to do it over again, i would probably buy the planets separately and order the better quality stars."
2,Hairline crack,Spot some hairline crack and the glow in the dark won't last long. And prefer that it come with a Sun as well.
2,Disappointing,"Your basicly paying $20. for nine small plastic ball's.The over 200 stars were not plastic ,durable stars but tiny stickers.I was not happy with it as a parent but my seven year old son liked it."
1,Whack,Just got this in and it is TOTALLY CHEAP. This is .99 cents store quality with a fancy box.They're just plastic little balls:/
4,Not bad,"Pretty inexpensive, doesn't take 135 IQ to figure out how to put it up, and the stars glow. It's a pretty good model. Some of the planets are kinda small, but my 6-yr old loves it, so it works."
5,my husband's big surprise,"My husband is from West Africa and misses his traditional food, so I opted to buy this book. He is greatley pleased and so am I now he can have the best of both worlds."
4,Just like Home!,"I'm a second generation Nigerian woman. I'm in my early twenties and I never learned how to cook the traditional food that my Mom makes for our family. Now that I'm on my own I found myself yearning for Naija food and this book has REALLY helped me learn to cook traditional Nigerian food. The receipes aren't perfect, but it's the best African cook book I've been able to find."
5,Great cooking guide,I really enjoy using this book because its concise and straight to the point which makes it easy to follow.
2,disappointing,"I am a big fan of Bananarama and I was looking forward to seeing their early videos, but was very disappointed with this collection. The first 5 videos on the collection are not shown in their entirety but are edited into a medley where you only get to see about a minute of each video. What's worse, in an attempt to make these old videos more ""modern"" looking they have superimposed writing that scrolls over the video and which is so thick that the original images are almost blotted out. The other vidoes, such as ""Venus"", are also recut into extended versions that just loop the old material over and over. So if you're looking to see Bananarama's old videos in their original versions you will unfortunately have to look elsewhere."
5,Thoroughly engrossing book.,"In the style of Richard Preston's ""The Hot Zone,"" Rhodes takes the reader into the jungles where kuru is breaking out and to the cities and countrysides of England which have been stricken by BSE and CJD. Readers are also introduced to the newest pathogen known to man, prions, a hitherto unheard of particle. If you've read ""The Hot Zone"" then you have to follow up with ""Deadly Feasts."""
4,Now What?,"This review refers to the abridged audio cassette version.While the entire three hours is gripping and keeps you listening in anxiety, in the end, you're left with a sense of ""Now what?"" There doesn't seem to be any shelter from this new virus; not even vegetarians are safe!I would have liked to have heard at least a starting point of what me and Joe Blow and Jane Doe could do to protect ourselves. If nothing can be done about it, then don't scare people. That's irresponsible. At least George Orwell could say, ""Just kidding, the world isn't really under attack.""I still gave it four stars for Rhode's ability to recount his research in an easily accessable language and for the subjects heuristic value."
1,pure fiction from a vegetarian point of view!!,"Although well written, the author has slanted his results to fit his ""tale"" of horror and doom! If we are to believe this book, then people will be dying of CJD at an alarming rate. He states that breathing bone meal can be fatal. Logic tells you that people working in that industry are breathing bone meal on a daily basis. They should be dying at a tremendous rate according to Rhodes. I haven't read or seen on the news any such outbreak. Maybe I do not care for authors that try to scare people to ""death."" Do not believe everything you read!!"
3,Science or fiction - you can never stop wondering,Although at face value this story appears to have considerable merit it cannot be taken too seriously. By the authors own account there is simply not enough knowledge in this area to know what action to take.Will you risk your children not getting their toy at MacDonalds over this? I wish I had that kind of power.
1,deadly bore,"in general, poorly written(reads like a first draft), but the first few chapters held my attention. i thought that it was a good and easy to read exposition of a serious biological/medical/envirnmental/public health/public policy issue, but as i read on i began to lose confidence in the accuracy/value/significance of what i was reading. the author progressively added more and more of his own opinion to the facts, often without making the distinction. i'm interested in reality, not the author's personal politics.too much idolization of Gladjusek(except he writes that Gladjusek is a pedaphile, after which he dismisses it as not being significant[so why mention it at all]) and too much villification of Prusiner. these flaws made me begin to question the accuracy/value/significance of everything that he posits as fact. this books starts out reading like the Scientific American and ends up reading like the National Enquirer.i'd love to own the movie rights."
2,good if you want to puke,"ok, so the book made me feel sick to my stomac. The only reason why I kept reading was because I had to. Its awful how Rhodes gets into expliced details. i dont need to hear that. If you think reading text books is a fun thing to do, you will love it. So have a life. This is one book that you can miss."
2,Antique Info,"I saw the publication date, and thought it would have info useful for my son, who plays paintball. While I never expected him to use the hygeine or medical section, I was hoping for a lot more regarding movement, fields of fire, and basic tactics. Not so.What I found was a rehash of a bunch of Cold War era FM's. All the info was Euro-centric, all the equipment was out of date (I doubt we even have 90mm RCLs in any armory inventory,) there was no real discussion of movement or signalling (despite the chapter). It did not help I found the entire manual online.The only thing saving this book from one star is the fact there were useful references. However, unless you are utterly unfamiliar with the Army, I would NOT recommeend this book."
2,Not what was expected,"I ordered this thinking it was a reprint of the current or at least a recent Individual Combat Skills manual. It is not. The graphics, diagrams and text are from manuals dating from the early 1970s to the very early 1980s. The product description is deceptive."
5,Why I Bought This CD,Forgotten Dreams by David Pietro was such a strong CD that I've ordered this latest CD without reading any reviews. I know I'll love it!
1,Must read,"I ordered this item and wrote a review before with 1 star, after a few months the review was removed. I was charged more than what was advertised, and the first time I poured hot water in the cup it cracked all the way down the side, I had to throw it away. I was so upset I wound up paying almost $60 for nothing."
5,Hillarious & Poignant,This wonderful book is a hallarious and all-too-poignant commentary on our contemporary social scene. Sherry captures the essence of human relationships. An enjoyable read for all . . .
1,"the worst of the ""plug-and-chug"" breed of textbooks","I had the misfortune to teach out of this book for one semester when I was first hired at my present job. I soon decided I would rather have needles stuck in my eyeballs than use it for a second semester. The big problem is the lack of explanation of _concepts_. Many chapters begin with an equation, without explaining what it means or where it might have come from. Many of the other textbooks available share these flaws to some extent, but this is the worst of a bad lot."
5,Interior Graphic Standards,Just exactly the book my daughter needed for one of her interior design classes at Ball State. And for a lot better price than she could find it other places.
5,IGS is a valuable design tool.,"Although I operate a small design office, I strive to create new details using common materials for each project. But before a new detail can emerge, I've realized its easier to reference past uses/details and create a new detail from a standard application. Since I do not have an extensive library of details, one book, Interior Graphic Standards (IGS) has become a valuable design tool in my office.In short, IGS offers an extensive amount of information in one volume. Its like one stop shopping without leaving the office.Data is cleanly organized. Simple drawings describe connections, patterns and standard measurements. And technical drawings help clarify more complex details. But most impressive is the beauty of the line drawings. The art of drafting has not been lost in the computer generated pictures.I encourage all Contractors, Designers and Artists to reference this book, whether you intend to design a table, a house or a museum."
4,it does the job,"it is very good on carpeted surfaces, but does not pick up everything from bare floors (unless i use the hose and additional heads which are provided). also, it is extremely heavy. still, since i got it primarily for the carpet, i am happy with it."
2,Worked well... for two years,"Loved it at first, but the plastic bit that releases the handle broke in the first year (fixed under warranty). Then it seemed to be losing suction and now the switch is not working. The guy at the repair store did not have anything good to say about Hoover, Bissel, Eureka, etc. Just ordered a DC17 Dyson from Amazon for $525 w/ a five year warranty. Expensive but if it last five years and does as well as reviewers say, then I be happy to have spent that amount of money for a vacuum."
1,Disturbingly disappointed.,"The day purchased the Savvy, I was so ecstatic--it did a wonderful job. Then I tried the turbo-paw & upholstery attachment, there was NO suction. Same was true for the edger. Hoover said, probably needed repair--after 1 use??!! (Parts under short time warranty, not labor!). Decided, OK, get a supplement vac for these projects for less cost. Kept filters cleaned etc, and watched for pet hair etc around roller. On the 3rd use--lost all suction. Checked, cleaned all systems AGAIN. Turned back on, and smell of bad circuit, then smoke! My last vacuum lasted 20 years, w/belt change now & then. The one before that had been in the family since the 1950's. Hoover really doesn't back this product! I could have paid someone else to vacuum my house 10 times, instead of purchasing this product that didn't last thru 3 uses!"
1,Do NOT buy the Hoover Savvy Vacuum,"I made the mistake of purchasing the Hoover Savvy Vacuum at Target in June of 2006. Maybe it was the pretty green color?? It cost $199 at the time, I would not pay $9 for this vacuum now. It worked well for about 10 months. Then the power switch started to fail. I have to move the switch nine or ten times back and forth for it to power up. Right now (a year later), the vacuum's hose is the only thing that will pick up dirt. I am completely disappointed in this purchase, and wish I could get back the $199 and put it towards a Dyson or a quality vacuum."
1,this vac is BAD,I would not spend a dime on anything from hoover. I have had this vac for 13 months and it is DEAD. Out of warrenty so I am out of luck. Don;t waste your time on this junk!!!
1,Do NOT Buy This Vacuum,"I bought this vacuum in late 2005 and used it lightly for nearly two years. But then the brushes stopped turning. I took it to a repair shop and was told that I had a problem with the circuit board that would take $90 to fix. He said the vacuum was terrible and he saw the problem all the time. He even showed me the one he was working on when I came in. He said he could fix it but I'd be back within a year with the same problem. $90 repair for a $200 vaccuum doesn't make a lot of sense to me, especially if the problem will continue. It was an easy decision to just throw it away and buy something else."
1,Barbaric Angioplasty,"I abandoned this hippogriff after six months. Lured in by promised power and technology. It's cleaning capability was lacking. And its featured ""wind tunnel"" design turned out to be its major fault. Bilateral forward mounted wind tubes have rough edged couplings within their lumens. This allows for hair to snag midway up the tubes. The hair then grabs lint and that leads to a full clot. You then have to snake a wire up the tube to clear out the clot. Plus the bagless system is a trap for that teeny-weeny dudu dust that fills in the nooks in the stinky filter. To clean it you turn a dial that runs the filter folds along a plastic ridge. Warning: you better be standing in the nearest parking lot when the dust and dudu start flying. With bagged vacuums you pull out the bag (dudu dust n' all) and slip in a fresh one. My Hoover Savvy is retired to the closet. The Kemore Progressive upright has proven to be the Queen Supreme."
1,Lousy machine,"The bearings went bad after only a few uses. As far I as can determine, neither Hoover nor any of their dealers sell replacement bearings. I paid $199 for a machine that doesn't work. I'm going to just throw it out and buy a new vacuum."
1,Don't buy this!,"Bought it in 2005, already in the trash after threee trips to the repair shop. Plain Junk!"
1,Once again - another vacuum bites the dust!,"Okay, we have a large house and 3 dogs, 3 cats, 3 kids - I was tired of having to pay $60 every time a roller went out - I bought this vacuum spending a lot more money thinking this should last past the typical 1 year - I haven't had this for more than a year and the roller keeps sticking - I clean the roller every month with all the traffic and hair but its another trip to the service center and another $60+ dollars - wish my money could be spent on a vacuum that lasts! I'm thinking about at Dyson - somethng has to be worth the money?!?"
1,The Worst Vacuum I Ever Owned,"Wow, it is almost like they tried to make the worst vacuum ever! We bought this in Aug 2006, and it lasted about a month. Since then, a piece has broken every month since then. It started with the stair cleaner (only used once when it stopped working). Next was the bare floor mode. It won't turn on, and I have to clean all my bare floors (the entire downstairs of my house) with the hand-held attachement. Which, by the way, won't fit on the vacuum anymore for some reason. Next was the carpet mode. It only works intermittently. I plan on leaving this out for bulk trash this week."
1,Very Disappointing,"The first 2 times I used this vaccuum it worked great -- I raved about it to friends. Then I started to hear a loud noise coming from the bottom, and next thing I know the ""lifetime"" belt broke. I had to get it repaired --- $50.00 for a $200 vaccuum (the belt must be replaced at a service center). Now the on/off switch is going, and there is no suction from the bottom at all -- only from the hose attachements! I have cleaned it out several times to no avail. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS MACHINE!"
4,"Good vacuum, bad belt.","I too have stripped the geared belt that was guaranteed for life. And because it's guaranteed for life, they don't sell them in stores, so I guess I'll be contacting Hoover Monday morning to see if they can send me one. Overall, it's been a great vacuum, just the belt issue has been a pain. Also, the green and red light feature is cool. And like mentioned above, it actually seems to work well.John in Alpine, UT"
1,this vac sucks!,"No pun intended. I am soooo disappointed with this vacuum. Started out working great. Bought it summer 05 by Feb 06 it had been in for service for ""clogging"", then a broken indicator light and now the motor is shot. Can't be replaced without a ""special order"" because the motor doesn't appear in the replacement catalogue. Contacted the company and all they could say was ""sorry we couldn't meet your needs"". Don't think I'll be buying hoover again and I suggest you don't either."
3,Good vacuum at first- then breaks!,"I have had two of these cleaners. I was really impressed when I got the first one. It worked awesome and picked up alot of dirt and was easy to use. However, after about a year the handle started shorting out and I eventually had to replace with a new one. I liked this one, and not being too expensive, I purchased the same model. Now, less than a year later, the handle is doing the same thing! If you don't play around with the switch then it will not vacuum! Also, the filter puts out alot of odor when you vacuum, especially if you have animals. The actual vacuum part smells worse than the animal hair! The filter is expensive to replace and it is hard to clean between replacing. I will not buy this vacuum again or another hoover at that. Expect to have to replace this cleaner in 1 year if you do decide to buy!"
1,Piling On,"Could be the worst vacuum cleaner ever made, but I haven't used them all. Out of a couple dozen, from a variety of manufacturers, it definitely is. As others note, motor is good (with luck), for about a year. Ours fizzled with smoke and ozone, but fortunately no meltdown or fire. In spite of the fire hazard though, it does have the added features of poor cleaning, weight, poor maneuverability, cheap construction, and poor engineering (plastic screw holes, power cord runs UNDER the floor plate where you run over it as you vacuum - I'm not kidding!). Not one of China's better products, but perhaps this is some sort of Cold War strategy. If you are one of those in love with this vacuum, get out more, stretch, broaden your horizons. Try another vacuum...."
3,Had To Comment,"I bought my Savvy by Hoover 2 years ago. Overall, the vacuum works very well. As stated by so many others here, the suction is great. The problem I had was with the finicky switch. I would have to toy with it to get it started and it would turn off as I was using it. Finally, the switch failed completely. I spent $85.00 to have it repaired. Seems to be a common complaint."
1,NOT WORTH THE MONEY,"VERY HEAVY AND DOES NOT CLEAN HARD FLOORS WELL AT ALL. I, TOO, WENT BY CONSUMER REVIEWS. NOW I DON'T TRUST THOSE REVIEWS."
2,loved this album,"it plays like it has slips in it, the package looked factory sealed, but plays like a copy from a computer, with unequal sound levels and a few glitches in the play, tried in 3 different players, great looking knockoff copy?"
1,Reg Strikes Back,I was so looking forward to getting this CD on the previous reviews.On listening to this CD thought the quality was terrble. In fact I wondered had it been produced in the two dollar shop.Very disappointed in the scratchy contents.
3,Reg Strikes Back,"Reg Strikes Back being Elton John's 1988 and his 21st studio album was met with mediocre critical review and I agree with them. This is an alright album but nothing more. There a few good tracks ""word in Spanish"" and ""I don't wanna go on with you like that"" but there are many tracks that are just not that great. The booklet has all the lyrics and a list of whom and what they play on the album. 3/5."
2,Fans can never be objective...,"From the OBJECTIVE reviewer...this would probably be considered the bottom of the barrel when it comes to Elton LPs if it we'ren't for the fact that the re-release includes the Shep Pettibone remix of ""I Don't Wanna Go On."" It improves the song 100% and actually makes it a good dance tune. It's hard to find anything else worth listening to (Mona Lisa's and Mad Hatters possibly)."
4,Reg is back with a vengeance,"The definition of pure brilliant pop song crafstmanship. From the opening track with it's soulful backup singers & onward to the beautiful Word in Spanish which makes nikita sound like a pathetic folk song. Mona lisa's & mad hatters part two is the perfect sequel (a cynical view of today's world which is a far cry from the social times of it's predecessor on ""Honky Chateau"". Perhaps the major flaw of this album (although there are few) is the album's major selling point ""I don't wanna go on with you like that"", despite it's awesome piano playing the melody & the lyrics are rather lame. Goodbye Marlon Brando shows the rocker at his nastiest & best with honorable mention to ""poor cow"" all in all this album is most enjoyable & is a definite must for any Elton fan."
5,Does what it is supposed to,"We needed these for one reason, my husbands late grandmother left him half dollars and he wanted to keep them in good condition. They do what they are supposed to."
4,Good with Dramatic License,"I saw this when it aired on TV. As always in these types of things, dramatic license was taken, in this case with appearances (Marie's character never got fat, and Timothy Bottoms's character never went bald as did the real Mr and Mrs Osmond). But if you want a behind the scenes video look on the Osmonds and how they got their start, I highly recommend it."
1,INACCURATE DESCRIPTION --NOT 1150 mAh!!!!,"The item they are currently shipping is NOT the 1150mAh described (and pictured) here -- it is only 1090sMh which will NOT work in the Panasonic Lumix FX01 and similar batteries -- it doesn't have enough power and the camera will have trouble focusing, taking movies, and taking pictures in low-light conditions.It will fit in the compartment but it will not function. The cameras listed in the title are NOT listed on the back of the package.I returned the first one thinking they had sent me the wrong item but when the replacement was identical, I realized they no longer have the one described here.If you're camera is sluggish using this battery -- now you know why."
3,Power For Pics,"I used this in my Panasonic Lumix digital camera. But I forgot to remove it and it was in the camers for several months; the next time I tried to use the camera, it would not turn on even though the battery was fully charged."
5,"Sparkling, Good Humor with Solid Basics (from PBS-U)","I bought the DVD and accompanying book. It uses good humor and a sparkling cast of what appear to be college students to present the material. The book is quite good and offers exercises (with answers) and additional material about words, grammar, useful phrases, vocabulary and pronunciation--about 170 pages. It only concentrates on the grammar of two verbs: ser and estar. The unfortunate thing about the material is that there are no further DVDs. Standard Deviants was an educational program on PBSU about 5-6 years ago that disappeared from lack of financing."
2,Pretty but beware flimsy chain!,"I really liked the way this cross and chain looked. Unfortunately, I only got to enjoy it for about a week before the flimsy chain broke and I lost the whole thing."
3,Mixed review,"I ordered this cross & chain and the order got lost. However, when I contacted Amazon.com, it was replaced immediately, and I was VERY happy with the item and the very quick service. However, I loved the cross so much, I wore it every day. I was careful not to put it under stress but one morning after about a week, when I picked it up to put it on the chain broke. I just picked it up off of a table and it fell apart. Is there anyway I can find another 18"" chain, maybe sturdier to wear with this cross? I like this cross and would only like to buy another chain for it so I can wear it again. Thank you for your help!"
3,broken chain,"I love this cross so much , and the design is perfect. but the same problem is that the chain was broken in a week, i was really upset thatthe chain doesnt seem that high quality, is there any way i could but a 18' chain, because 35 dollar is not a cheap price just for a chain."
3,"Nice Charm, Awful Chain","I agree with everyone else, the chain is just too thin for the pendant. The cross was surprisingly substantial in weight, which I was pleased to see. I didn't even try wearing it with that chain and went and bought a nice one for 10 bucks. I still say this cross is worth the money, even without the chain."
4,Cross,Arrived in perfect condition. The chain however was too thin and we opted to have another one put on it. It's a beautiful item and it's been worn a lot.
5,Very Useful SAS Manual,"This book is an excellent guide to the practical implementation of categorical data analysis methods. I use it all the time.While it's true that you need some background in statistical theory to really use theses methods effectively, the authors provide helpful reminders and overviews. The also employ interesting examples and give variations on SAS code to illustrate -- step-by-step -- how a good analysis should proceed.This book is a very good value for anyone who uses categorical methods."
3,yes and no,"The book is handy. It has SAS commands needed for running your analysis. Nonetheless, you will need to refer to other texts to understand your choices."
4,Categorical Data Analysis Using the SAS System,I got the book in a very good condition. i would want to order more through amazon.
4,Excellent progressive soundtrack music,"Goblin is an always-excellent Italian band most noted for their film scores. This, DRG's third compilation, would stand better as part of a larger set rather than on its own. While the music contained herein is for the most part very good, it only offers a few glimpses of the many sounds Goblin offered in over a decade of work. There's not a lot of consistancy here in this compilation, but nevertheless it is all uniquely fascinating progressive rock/electronic soundtrack music."
4,"Almost, but not quite","This CD does not come close to the Zombi anniversary CD, as this only has three tracks from the Dawn of the Dead Soundtrack, but it is a good starter. I had this CD before the Dawn CD, so it was nice to at least have a few good Dawn songs before my Zombi CD arrived. Other tracks are good, but not as memorable as classic Dawn tracks."
4,would love to see an updated revised edition,"Dr. Brown's book helped me understand some of the dynamics that created problems in past relationships. It was thoughtfully written. Unfortunately, there have been no revisions since its original publication date. Dr. Brown's ideas would integrate beautifully with recent relationship and communication research findings."
5,My Favorite NAB!,"I love this St. Joseph NAB! I bought my first copy some time ago, and now I give them away as gifts. It has a very nice hard cover and green gloss on the outside of the pages. Text is perfect size for reading too. I'm so used to the traditional red copy, so this newly published St. Joseph in green just makes it more special to me as an every day Bible."
4,Missing version!!!,"I purchased this CD hoping Colleen Hewitt's DAY BY DAY single mix would finally get a release on CD...but no this version is the cast recording from the stage show not the radio single mix...someone made a big goof when they put this version out on the CD.All other tracks are in good order.Steel Guitar (single) is on CD here for the first time, I think....and a few other minor recordings by splinter projects of well-known pop teams.Some of the versions of songs here are also a bit thin sounding and could have done with some careful mixing to get volumes and treble and bass to similar levels.Sorry if this a negative review but mostly I would have to say I'm disappointed by this compilation"
2,"Good on spec, poor on quality","Despite its claim of 1.3 megapixels, the images taken from this tiny camera are blurry with ""washed out"" colors, either indoors or out. One can easily fall in love with its compact size and simplicity, but it is still a camera; a camera is about taking good pictures. I wouldn't reccomend this product to anyone who wants to capture more than just outlines and profiles."
1,Disappointment,"I purchased this without reading the reviews and now I'm returning it. The form factor is great. Its small and easy to carry. USB is handy for transferring the pictures, but the picture quality is poor. Even for me, a casual picture taker, I want the few times I go to the trouble to take pictures to have nice results. This camera just isn't that."
4,"Handy, Genuine Pocket Sized","I have had a lot of fun with this camera. The picture quality is not great (the 1.3MB claim is a bit rich) and indoor photos come out quite poorly because there is no flash. However, for a camera that I can carry around in my pocket (it weighs next to nothing), ready to take shots of any and all situations aroud me it is very handy. There is no way I could ever carry a full-featured camera in my pocket, so my thinking is, this camera is definitely better than no camera. For the price, I think it is great.It's also great to pull out of your pocket. ""What IS that????"" It's a great conversation starter.Pros:Size, Ease of Use, Memory, Ease of Recharging (from computer's USB port)Cons:Picture quality"
4,Good guide for yanni's music!!,"Do you want to know about Yanni's music? Without hesitation, I proudly recommand this album! Yanni said that he doesn't like to be called as a 'New Age Musician'.But I think it is the fact that his music gives us purified comfort and rest. In this album, there are many famous and lovely songs which would give you that kinds of rest. Some critics say that he is not a musician but a business man because there are a number of compilation albums. But those compilation albums have nothing t do with Yanni. His former record companies just made those albums. I think it would be able to a good gift.Whenever we try to buy his compilation albums for gifts, we have to have some troubles to choose right one.If you are in this condition, I recommand this albums. You can just taste good part of his music!"
5,i wnt to listen yanni's music,my favourite music director greek musician yanni i have his albums some of albums i dont have thas why i want to hear yannis this album
3,Red Snowman Hoodie [M],"The item is quite adorable and made very well [very durable]. My only complaint is that it is a little short on the rear end. Rather than covering the behind, it jumps up to about mid section. Also, the area around the neck must be wide or loose. I say this because both dogs I had purchased this for, will always end up with one arm hanging out of the sleeve."
3,replacement blades,I recently purchased a replacement combo blade and foil for my Panasonic shaver and I was very disappointed when I received it and replaced my original blade and foil with the new combo pack. The new blades are not sharp as the original ones and they don't give you a clean shave. I don't think the quality of the replacement blades are the same as what comes with the shaver when you first purchase them.
1,Didn't work for my razor.,"I purchased this for a razor that is listed on the site, but it didn't work. The details should be reviewed for this item.."
3,Restores like new performance... but costly,"As a few have pointed out, the cost of this ""renew"" kit is rather disconcerting at almost half the cost for my electric razor new (model ES8077). Hence the three stars.But it did fully bring my 5 year old shaving action back to as-new performance and no longer do I get that tugging sensation with my worn out blades/foil."
4,Excellent performance and durability. Overpriced.,"I've been using Panasonic foil-type electric shavers for years, and I am very pleased with them. I prefer them to the rotary electric razors. This particular (Vortex Combo) replacement foil and razor set has performed very well, despite that I don't make a consistent effort to clean the shaver and might have knocked the foil against the sink a couple of times or turned on the razor before properly closing the foil contraption. It looks like the set will last me about a year, as have similar sets in the past (they are supposed to last less than that, but I find that I can use them for a year without problems). This being said, I can't help but express my discontent at the high prices of these things. I can't help but think that they are overpriced and only able to sell at such prices because there isn't much competition and because people are stuck buying them once they've found a shaver that works for them and needs the blades and foil replaced."
5,Necessary...,"I have a heavy beard and after 8 months, I need to replace the blades and outer foil. The replacement was as advertised and arrived in a timely manner. I agree with other reviewers that the replacements are expensive, but unfortunately in my case, they are necessary. For lighter beards, I would recommend going longer than 6 or 8 months before replacing blades and foil (despite what the manufacturer recommends)."
3,Can someone tell me why one should replace the foil?,"I've had my shaver for over a year now. I've replaced the blades a couple of times, but can someone tell me why I should replace the foil? It doesn't look broken or any different from the day I bought it. I doesn't actually do the cutting does it?"
1,This is way too expensive,This combo is over 30% of the cost of the entire shaving system including the cleaning base. This is simply outrageous.
1,"Refurbished, but sold as new - hairs on foil? Ewww!!","I'm not sure why, but inside this very tightly sealed package, I can see several human whisker hairs on the surface of the foil. It says nothing about this being a refurbished product, but it clearly is, unless it was tested or something? Either way, I don't want some dude's whiskers on my face when I'm shaving. Gross. I sent it back for a replacement and hopefully this time I'll get a clean one."
3,"A bit pricey, but will make your shaver as good as new","It's a bit expensive at $40, but a great way to make that shaver just like new! But I'm probably gonna end up getting a new razor on the next go around just to catch one of those Amazon deals on bulk buys for a shaver and its accessories. Those Vortex cleaning cartridges are starting to add up at retail price.Amazon still has the best price w/ free shipping all around."
3,Almost the price of a new shaver,"For this price you can almost buy a new Panasonic ES7103K ($49.47 on Amazon) shaver which includes this combo.Panasonic ES7103K Pro-Curve Wet/Dry Triple Head Shaver, Black"
3,"Expensive, proprtietary replacement parts","Brand name replacement parts are always way too expensive (think OEM car parts), but when you need them you buy them anyway. The Panasonic Replacement Outer Foil and Inner Blade Set is no exception. The quality is good, as in all Panasonic products; I just wish the price was reasonable and that's why I only gave this item 3 Stars. It's just one of those things you have to live with..."
3,"just not like new, but does the job","just not like new, but does the job,just not like new, but does the jobjust not like new, but does the job"
4,Panasonic Razor Replacement Parts,I have been using the Panasonic electric razors for the last twenty years and have never had a problem out of them. Usually change the screen once a year and the blades every two years!
3,Panasonic WE9012PC Vortex Combo Replacement,"Purchased this hoping it would improve the shaving ability of my razor. For some reason, wasn't as good as the original."
3,Drifter1,"Cost is absurd. They give away the razor to get you to spend almost half the price for replacement foil and blades. Still, its a very good razor and worth buying the kit every year for 3 year or so til battery wears out.Be careful Amazon often has the same items sold by various dealers at surprisingly different prices. Shop the web first for the price and then come here for the reliability."
5,Superb!,"I agree with all the favorable reviews here on Amazon. I can't add much to what has already been said. I've had my Panasonic ES8077 for about 4 years and I replace the blade and foil just once per year. This shaver still works like the day I bought it. The quality of the blades is exceptional and the shaver unit itself it impressive. The battery life, in particular, is amazing. I didn't expect this product to be as durable as it has been. So few electronic products last as long as we expect them to. This is an exception."
1,Garbage....,If I could give less then one star I would. My Dad got me these knives and I used them for about 2 months till I went out and bought another set to replace it. These things are rubish and a waste of money.... avoid these unless you are you enjoy your knife bending everytime you slice an onion. I don't make this stuff up folks.
5,GREAT value !,"Got this set on May 26, 2008 via the ""TODAY's Deals"" section and I am so glad I jumped on it! The price was great at 69.99 and the quality is excellent! Much Better than what I expected.I would Highly recommend this product."
3,I'm not sure,I bought this because I have mouse problems in my garage and basement. I put out this product according to the directions and have noticed nothing consuming the product. I wonder if it would work better if the rodents consumed it. I'll try it again this winter and see if it works but for now I can't say it has helped.
3,SIZE IS SMALL,"I Like Uncle Mikes Holsters, However, this one was 'smaller' than it 'should' have been,it was a size #1, I bought this to replace a Uncle Mikes size #1 that I was using allready, I got this one for the attached mag pouch, My gun would NOT FIT, even though my gun fit the #1 size I had been using,it would not even attempt to START into the new holster,no need to try,it was not even close to the right size,I am not sure how the same size could be 'smaller' but it was,I am not able to use it,and now it is for sale in my local news paper."
4,Taize Instrumental 2 CD,This is a great CD for quiet background music. Very appropriate for meditation or studying. Just what I was looking for.
2,Missing DC Adapter,"Package was missing the DC car adapter. Amazon advised to contact the manufacturer directly. Went to Motor Trend and am now being directed to yet another web page. Also, instructions did not say how long to charge the light after the initial charging. Does not appear to have an auto shut off on the charge so you have to make sure you unplug it after recommended charge time. For the money, this purchase was disappointing."
4,really nice for the price,"My Friend give me one for christmas it was working right for the whole year, but just last month i really dont know what happend to it doesnt light up anymore. I brough new lightbulb new battery and even the Electrical Adaptor but nothing... thats the reason why only 4 stars only work for me less then 2 years..."
3,"Great idea, not brilliantly executed","I wanted to like Goodwins' book, and enjoyed reading a few of his limericks in the bookstore, but having purchased it, I feel like I have been had!Most of the limericks are weak, and too often, the author has not completely grasped the meaning of the biblical passage he is writing about.One of his better ones is about Caleb: [See Joshua chapter 14]At eighty-five, Caleb said ""IAm strong as I ever was. MyInheritance, Hebron,Was Moses' gift - and onMy God I will always rely.""A great idea, but be warned: the idea is better than the execution."
3,who are the neocons?,By reading this book I finally understand who the neocons are. I have always wondered when everyone referred to them who they were. The book is very informative but difficult to read and digest. There is just so much information that it makes your head spin. But overall I am very glad I ordered it.
3,Try Reading Before Reviewing,"Exempting myself to deliver this message, which is not a review (I assigned the book a rating only because it is a required field):Don't review this book, or any other, unless you have READ it. A review based SOLELY on ideology or political sympathies is worse that useless. Read the book. Then say what you will."
1,Don't Bother...,"Any book that starts with the premise that the cold war was won by a diplomacy set in bi-partisanship has absolutely no credibility. While there were some democrats like Scoop Jackson, Les Aspin, Sam Nunn, etc. who did take the Soviet threat seriously, the VAST majority of congressional democrats post-Vietnam pushed appeasement and worked to undermine Republican administrations' efforts to contain the Soviets in both Europe and in the Western Hemisphere. This is especially true of House Democrat leaders who at times offered comfort and reassurance to our enemies. Read ""Witness"" by Whitaker Chambers or ""Useful Idiots"" by Mona Charen for more explication, but the very premise of THIS book that the Bush Administration abandoned a consensus diplomatic model due to a neo-con coup is just a riduculous lie."
5,New Review!,I like this item 0521838347 very much You should read more reviews to find out more about it
3,Staccatos Ottawa rockers,"Early collection from Ottawa , Canada rock band , which later became the Five Man Electrical Band & had a No. 3 hit in 1971 with Signs . No hits on this album , but may be of interest to collectors of Canadian rock . My main interest lies in the fact that a good friend was a member of the original band ."
5,An Outstanding Conductor,I bought this DVD just to check out this young conductor- Gustavo Dudamel- and it turned out to be one of the best choices that I ever made.What an outstanding conductor and this youth orchestra brings out the best of Ravel's orchestration of Mussorgsky's 'Pictures at an Exhibition'. Its amazing that this young team bring in so much passion to music.
5,wonderful exuberance!,"The Salzburg Festival is all about old European tradition and great music and thus needs to be dusted off from time to time. I am not able to pronounce on whether the performances on this DVD are AAA but at the end you will either cry or cheerfor the pure wonder of seeing these young people play with a total involvement for the score, particularly when you think about the history of this orchestra. Pure visual and acoustic excitement and as alway ""the Dude"" shines! The master classis a great bonus, particularly if you have the LASO DVD of their performance of Mahler 1st."
4,It is not the product but the company,"I bought this product for my mother, who enjoys music DVDs. I was used to Amazon's excellent service before they instituted the $79 for excellent service. I choose to pay for shipping every timy I order. The items in my last orders have taken 18 to 25 days to arrive! This is unacceptable.About the music. The first part is more traditional and underscores Dudamel's energy and desire for innovation. The second part is more geared for audiences under 60. (My mother is 94). All in all, I enjoyed the music but react to this new policy of making you wait three weeks or more for your order. I still have items, ordered three and half weeks ago that have not arrived. They blame it to the post office!"
2,A very broad & not very useful overview,"This outline is to broad and too shallow to be that useful. The outline tries to cover SQL, database theory, functional dependencies, normalization, database security, the entity relationship model, and throw in an MS Access example screen every now and then - all in just 250 brief pages. I hate to give the book two stars, because that usually indicates a book is pretty useless, but I feel I'd be a little too kind in giving it three stars too. My advice is to go with an introductory book like ""Databases Demystified"", and then get a book dedicated to SQL and learn that language separately. I prefer ""Learning SQL"", published by O'Reilly and Associates. If you want more advanced material on database theory after that, C.J. Date's book, ""An Introduction to Database Systems"", is a good one."
2,Typos and omissions,"This text is littered with typos. The narrative is dry and difficult to read; the authors seem to walk all over themselves trying to over-explain things rather than just taking the time to find the most concise and understandable way to say them. They use nonstandard symbols in their technical descriptions, and some symbols are simply not explained at all.I am not very impressed with this book. I am basically skimming through it to pick up the basic concepts and I will explore them on my own without the help of this book."
4,Not as strong as their debut.,"National Velvet's 2nd album and last recording ""Courage"", (1990) is more of a hard rock offering, than it's first release in 1988. Produced by German musician and producer Zeus B. Held (who did records for a lot of artists in the 80's and 90's, his most popular were Men Without Hats ""Pop Goes the World"" and Transvision Vamp ""Pop-Art""). National Velvet went to Londonto record this. The first single is their most popular tune, ""Sex Gorilla"" the vocals of Maria Del Mar were their calling card. Other songs that floated my boat are, ""(A Place Called) Hysteria"", ""Border Patrol"", is interesting. ""Rattlesnake"", has some good spots. The sexy ""Weebles"", a fun tune, her vocals on ""First One"", are great. Not a bad album, nobody really understood them."
1,CHEAP PRICE AND CHEAP LIGHT,You get what you pay for. Very little light. Don't wast your money on this one After the 2 trips light went out. Seen some other Green lights that were 5 times as bright.
2,Hmpf!,"We ordered this for my son's first birthday, early May 2011. He's not a brute with toys, however, within 6 months the bucket lift no longer functioned. Whenever he tries to put the bucket up high to push it around the house, it immediately falls back down. It functioned for the first 6 months but no longer. I contacted Amazon and was told we needed to contact Bruder. Despite repeated calls and emails to Bruder, I've never received an answer/response. I would think the product would have a one-year warranty but I'm too frustrated to continue trying to contact them. Suffice it to say, we won't be purchasing any more Bruder products, and cannot recommend them. My son still enjoys the toy but gets frustrated when it won't work properly."
3,"good, but it may be a bit difficult for a bignner.","This book is good, with many charts and diagrams. But it is also true that this book is a little bit difficult for a beginner in biochemistry."
5,Super sharp,"I switched years back to Tajima blades. They are much sharper than most and when you shop around you'll find great package deals. The GRI series knives are the most comfortable ergo knives out there. If your doing any drywall work, try the Rock-hard series; the tips stay sharp for hours."
3,Tiny shrimp and tiny flavor,"I don't see the purpose of this product. I can't even taste the shrimp. They're tiny, which is fine. I've added it to rice dishes, and even made fried shrimp patties with onion and green chilies. There is just no flavor. I guess there's benefit in that it is a protein, but I won't re-order for the price. I prefer to cook frozen raw shrimp."
2,Insoles Come Out,Very cool looking shoes. Comfortable. They only lasted me a couple weeks because the insole came loose. Very disappointing.
4,Proving Christian Music Doesn't Always Suck,"I'm not one to usuaslly listen to any kind of christian music...period. I dont know, i just dont feel the need to listen to someone preach about a being that wwas never there for me when i needed them, and they have no reason to believe that there is a God in the first place.Anyway...........i was very impressed with this album and band. The music is heavy, not super fast, but mid-to-medium paced tempo, and the lyrics DO praise God, but are aslo pissed and angry at the same time. Vocally, the vocals are more old school hardcore thean newer-metalcoreish vocals, but still good and descent. Check em out if you wanna try something different."
5,Riveting!!!! Fabulous read!!!!,I have read a tremendous amount on NAVY SEALS and this is one of the best. An easy book to get into and not put down.
4,"Old school, and the better for it","Bought this to prepare for an audition. It's a live recording, and it's not the greatest fidelity. BUT, it's and excellent interpretation and it's definitely worth the buy. Great music, of course, as well."
1,Do Not Buy This Product !,"Unless you buy someone unknown amount of merchandise Office Depot will charge you an additional $4.99 as a ""Small Order Handling Fee"", so your $4.67 pack of mailers actually costs over $10 after they tack on shipping."
5,Great!!!,Stéphane Pompougnac does a perfect job on this album. Just what expected. Great music!!! Great performance and amazing taste. I can't wait for the next master piece.
5,one of my favorites,"If you're into the Lounge genre. This CD is a must have. The Hotel Costes CD's were nice but this CD exceeded all my expectations, and definatly shows his mastery of production."
5,Wonderful book!,"regards from Panama, Central America! I bought this book a little bit nervous about the the fact that it's originally written in English, so I thought i could get lost in translation Or that it would be too regional (for example with mexican slangs). But both my kids (7 and 3 years old) have enjoyed it so much that I have to read it at least twice a week as a bedtime story. My older son enjoys the irony very much and the little one loves the illustrations that are rich and original.Definetely a good addition to any collection!"
4,blues jr cover,everything it claims to be and more. if u have the blues jr tweed grab the brown cover for it. 4 stars instead of 5 because the price could maybe be less and obviously u can survive without one. it's nice though. and nice to have as well. cheers
3,easy to set up and use on xp,The product was easy to set up on my TOshiba Tecra and did not need any external drivers. But it freezes my computer when I tried it on my thinkpad.
4,A Simple Introduction to Indian Cookery,"One thing is certain, Curries Without Worries is not a pretentious cookbook. The recipes are simple and straightforward, and the commentary dwells a lot on which family member loves which dish.Koul does a good job of demystifying the spices, ingredients and cooking styles that might otherwise trip up Western cooks. And -- of course -- the food is wonderful."
4,The best Indian food is always found at home,"I borrowed (stole?) this book from a friend, and am slowly working my way through it. Everything so far has been delicious, and I am slowly gaining enough confidence to try substitutions when my spice cupboard is not up to the demands of the recipe (what are curry leaves, anyway?) The recipes are conveniently separated into chapters for dishes with and without meat, plus some side dishes and pickles. For those interested in getting a basic education in Indian cuisine, this is a good place to start. I hope Sudha Koul is planning another, more advanced, cookbook, which, if it has pictures, and recipes of the same reliability, I would give 5 stars..."
2,"Clever title, wretched recipies","I enjoy preparing (and eating) Indian food. Consequently, I have a goodly number of Indian cook books. Some of them I use frequently, some seldom. After several real disasters, I never use this book anymore.Despite the clever title, the recipies in this book have proven to entirely unsatisfactory. For one thing, there is an excessive use of cayenne pepper in many of the recipies. I find that the amount of ghee called for is also excessive. This is not subtle, flavorful seasoning.There are now a number of excellent Indian cookbooks out there, this certainly isn't one of them."
2,Save your appetite for something else,"I would not reccomend this book. I love cooking Indian food and have been disappointed with many recipes in this book. Often times it seems that 'shortcuts' have replaced conventional cooking methods, sacrificing taste and preperation. I would not reccommend this to someone who truly craves an Indian meal."
2,Be Warned,I have made some very good things with this book but others are just flat out awful. The worst example was a recipie that actually called for 2 Tablespoons of cayenne pepper and as a result was absolutely inedible! (Note I have the first edition so hopefully these mistakes have been corrected for this printing).
4,Brass Shower Head,My order arrived ahead of the scheduled date. The showerhead is great for low water systems. It's efficient and I don't have to take a shower with just water dripping; this product pack a lot of power. I highly recommend.
3,Smaller than you imagine,"The ship is much smaller than i expcected. The picture mislead me to believe that my fish could travel through the window and perhaps explore the tiny vessel. Other than that, its a very cute and detail piece of merchandise."
3,Not so good,"I wasn't too thrilled with this book. The story was boring until the last 30 or so pages. It felt like something was missing, better luck next time."
5,A Keeper!,i never thought i'd like that hood fiction...but Shannon has changed my mind forever! this book was off the hook! from the begining to the end i was hooked!
3,it's no b-more careful,This book was ok to me. Nothing to exciting that just jumped out from the pages to me. But overall he did an ok job with this one describing west philly and the girls in this story.
4,Why females turn to this lifestyle....,"I really enjoyed this book. It was a good read. Shannon took story telling to another level. Giving you the real. He didn't sugar coat any of this tale. Bad Girlz not only gave insight to the day in the life of a stripper. But,how she got there and why she kept doing it... Desperate times call for desperate measures. Tender and Goldie are perfect examples of what happens to females who are lost without guidance and family support. They are easily manipulated and taken advantage of by the sharks and other ruthless people in the game.""You gotta make the money, don't let the money make you."" If you enjoyed the movie Player's Club, you'll really like this book. It was hard for me to put it down. I read this book in a day. Most of this book could have been based on a true story... Not all of it."
2,Bad girlz=Bad book,"I decided to read this book because i had heard alot of good things about it, but when I read it I did not like it that much. I just thought that the story was a little dull maybe cuz the whole stripper thing and all. It's not like i hated the book its just that i wish i had not purchased it."
3,Real Good Book,"I enjoyed this book very much. I thought that Shannon Holmes did a good job with it. I will admit that it is not good like ""B-More Careful. I liked the character Tender. I thought she was a strong-willed person despite everything she's gone through. Good job Shannon Holmes."
4,Shannon you have DONE IT AGAIN!!,"This book is as good as Shannon said it would be (glad the stripping theme worked out :) . It showed the UNGLAMOUROUS side of exotic dancing which is rarely seen. Money is definitely the root of all evil. However, I would agree that the end was indeed rushed . It should have been a bit smoother. Overall a really good book."
4,Good but not GREAT,"OK I will say this, the book was good. I will not take any credit from him. I just thought he rushed the ending. Throughout the book everything was well laid out. I think he felt that his book was long and took the easy way out and ended it. I will not tell you about the ending but I mean next time Take Ya Time. All in All the book was good."
4,Very Good....,"this was my first Shannon Holmes book and i was very impressed. the book is a good example of how ""everything that glitters aint gold"".....for those that arent into the strippin game, its shows you that its a use or be used world and that someone will pay a heavy price somewhere along the way....i guess its time for a brother to read B-More Careful.....onelove"
5,Bad Girlz! you gotta be more careful!,"I can only say one thing about this book, and Author...you're Great!You are from ,the real streets. ""With no holds bar"".Mr.Holmes, you are a remarkable writer. I can respect an author such as yourself. Who talks about the streets. On the Real tip, not some make believe mess, and I love you for that.I'm always searching for your books so keep it comin.Your #1 FannnnnnnnnPeace!"
3,Alright Book,"This book was oookaaay. It was kinda slow and it reminded me of the movie Player's Club. Kat reminded me of Ronnie, and Tender reminded me of Diamond and Goldie was the cousin. I expected something way better after reading B-more careful. Oh well maybe next time."
2,I DONT REMEMBER ANYTHING ABOUT THIS BOOK,I CANT REMEMBER ANYTHING ABOUT THIS BOOK BUT THE AUTHORS NAME!TRU TO DA GAME WAS GOOD BUT THIS BOOK I HAVE AMNESIA.
5,A young Ones Opinion,"The book Bad Girlz was really good!! It reminds me a lot of my life. I have read the book twice, and I am in the process of writing it again. If you would like to share comments on this book....(...)"
2,Just OK!,"Shannon Holmes is a great writer, but I didnt feel this was one of his greatest work. This book is similiar to TRUE TO THE GAME and B-MORE CAREFUL, but isnt as good as those books. The book was predictable, from beginning to end."
3,tracy,I enjoyed the book .i felt the characters feelings and conversations were on point and very realistic
3,I'm only given an extra star for Bmore Careful,"Now I went out and got this book based on reviews and the fact that I really loved Bmore Careful, but I was highly disappointed when I finished this book. It was very animated but the plot was poorly written and no matter what Mr. Holmes says...this is Players Club with different names. I hated how it was sooo ghetto. I understand that these girls went through some things but all that ghetto talk just aggrivated me. And their conversations were tooooo drawn out. Get to the point but to say something in five different ways when they all mean the same thing is just a waste of space. I don't know...it's just not what I expected. How naive could Tender and Goldie have been. Give us girls a little more credit...I dont know..I can go on and on..but I'll just say: two thumbs down"
2,Wasn't feeling It..,The book was good at the beginning but then as it progressed I couldn't read it anymore. Therefore I passed it on to someone else and they seemed to enjoy it. I wasn't feeling it :-(.
3,Far from Street Savvy,"The beginning of the book was definitely a grabber! You were sucked right in and left drooling for more of the harsh fast action. I agree with some of the previous reviews, although the book was written around Tender, I felt Kat took the lead. What I don't understand is, these women were making big time dollars and supposedly had much street sense, but failed to realize that Kat was flat out pimping them. Kat was surely a pimpette, setting up,sealing and collecting on the deals. She was about the almighty dollar going to every and any extent to get it. Also, why in the world didn't either Tender or Goldie have enough sense to move out?! Although satisfied with Kat's fate, the ending left me dissatisfied for some reason. All in all, the book was a good read, I look forward to Holmes next release."
1,just didnt do it for me,"This book just didn't work out for me. I am an avid reader and this book jumped all around the place and if I read 'she will soon find out' and then not find out one more time, I was gonna scream. It left out details that would hlep you follow along otherwise left you lost and wondering whatever came of the situation. I mean who lets somebody else hold their money and be scarred to ask for it, just stupid stuff. I have read one other book my Shannon holmes and it wasn't all that either. I won't give up on Shannon, but won't run to buy anotha book to quick either."
4,I enjoyed it,"I enjoyed Bad Girls. I liked how Mr.Holmes captured the cattiness that women posses. I will be sure to write about this book in my urban fiction blog ""My Urban Books"" [..]"
3,Pretty good,"Growing up in the 'hood, a lot of the scenarios Holmes paints are believable and relatable. However, I think that Holmes fails to develop his characters fully. I was never able to connect with Tender, the main character. Although I understood where she was, is, and will probably ultimately end up, she never felt ""real"" to me. Her character was forgettable."
4,"Becky Due - Author of The Gentlemen's Club, Touchable Love",Bad Girlz kept me reading to the end. Not an easy subject but worth reading.
2,From The acknowledgments....,"Which includes the mention of the writer securing a ""six figure deal"" to the abuse of ebonics, unoriginal story line, underdeveloped characters, predictable outcomes and typical scenarios, I must say this was not my idea of an entertaining read. I feel Mr. Holmes may become a bit more profound as time goes on but for now all I see is the typical and redundant stories about growing up down on your luck, in the inner city doing what you must to survive, always illegal of course. This is not a guide for a teenager gone astray, if anything, with all the mention of ""fly gear"" ""fly whips,"" etc. It may actually be appealing to a young vulnerable girl. This story is not new, and to be blunt I am fairly tired of new authors being repetitive, bring something intriguing, bold, unexpected to the table."
4,Breath Taking,"First i want to start by saying Shannon Holmes you did it with this book, i read this book in one day, i really enjoyed the stories about kat, goldie, and tender. i just wished it went on a little longer because i was getting into the book and before i new it i was finish, i love all of the characters, but i really loved tender because everyone unestimated her. can't wait for the next book to come out."
2,Piece of crap,"By the ratings given on this site you might actually think that the book was good, but it's not. Don't waste your money, it was a load of crap. It was basically ""the players club"" but the written version."
2,IT COULD HAVE BEEN ALOT BETTER,FOR ONE IT DIDN'T HAVE A THING ON B-MORE CAREFUL. AND IT'S REALLY A WASTE OF YOUR TIME AND MONEY. NO IT WAS NOT ALL THAT. IT'S JUST TALKING ABOUT THESE THREE STRIPPERS AT THIS STRIP CLUB AND A LIL BIT OF DRAMA BUT LIKE I SAID YOU DON'T NEED TO WASTE YO TIME
2,A WASTE OF TIME,The first chapter was the best chapter of the book. So after you read the first chapter just pop The Players Club in your DVD player and don't bother to read the rest of the book. Very disappointed with this one Shannon Holmes.
3,Disappointing!!!!!!!!!!,I was very disappointed in this book. If you are into the stipper thing maybe this would be okay for you. But because I have read other stuff by Mr.Holmes I know he can do better. This book had to much violence and I thought that Kat was just plain evil. I know there really are Kat's in the world but I believe (at least I want to believe) that most of us could see a person like her from far away. I am not knocking the hustle of stripping but I just thought the story was a little much.
3,NOW WHERE HAVE I SEEN THIS BEFORE????,"its THE PLAYERS CLUB DANGIT, THATS WHERE!!! after the first chapter its clear that the story of such strippers would have to be alot more visual. i couldnt picture these girls being so fly, so street smart and so dumb all at one. it leads me to think that g-string divas is as creative as it gets for the world of the stripper. we all know there is a certain element of danger involving being a stripper, duh, but what nobody told me is how risky it can be to mess with a hip hop record execs baby mama. now that mess can get you killed for no reason!!!! this book was not all that, it was not the bomb but if you insist, go ahead and read it and get it over with. come back to amazon and agree with my review :)"
5,"Bad Girlz weren't Good, but Good At It!","Shannon Holmes has done it again! Tonya's introduction in the first chapter keeps you turning pages until you reach the back cover.Set in one of the hardest Philadelphia areas, the three heroines of this book play hard ball, and they're so bad, they're good!Life brings trials and tribulations for you to make the best out of, and baby, only the strong survive. If you get lemons, you best figure out a way to make lemonade!Tonya, Kat, and Goldie, are literally dancing their lives away in this novel, but I won't tell you what happens, you are going to have to read it to find out yourself!"
3,I THOUGHT I WAS WATCHING PLAYERS CLUB,Good book but it resembled Players Club. Shannon Holmes should have distributed before the movie came out. B-More Careful was a lot more original.
4,good read,This was a good book. It could have been great if it had lasted a little longer. I found it to be too short. Bad Girlz could have told some more of their experiences and or more characthers.
4,This was a good one,"This was a good book, i didn't think so because it was a stripper book but it was a good one its relateable i am sure thats alot of girls can relate to the situations in this book"
3,could have been better!,This is the first book that i have ever read by Shannon Holmes. This book could have been much better. I didn't like how it seemed as if the author rushed through the ending of the book. I did however enjoy how he was able to give a little insight into the background lives of the three girls which gave the readers a chance to understand them a little bit more better. Overall the book was a'ight!!!
5,Excellent,I was very surprised at how much I enjoyed this book. It was great. I enjoyed every part of it: the ups and downs. It kept me interested from beginning to end and that is very hard to do. I loved the plot and the characters. Shannon Holmes had great characterization and that made them so life-like. I really enjoyed the character of Tonya Morris. I liked the fact that she was very determined and never gave up. I recommend this book.
4,A good read,"I found this book a good read. Honestly it seems more like a biography than a novel and i found that rather good. It was very interesting to see things this way and survival in it top form. Not to mention how the area i live in now, what other parts of the community formed in a way i haven't seen yet. The best part i like about it was the pimp was a female. that was different than you see when men are the pimp. shannon holmes showed that women can be as dangerous and vindictive as men... maybe more."
3,Not Impressed!,"The beginning of this book started off in the right direction (I was looking for more), then it made a turn for the worse. I wasn't impressed by the ending. I know this is a ""steet novel"" but why do they all have to end the same way? I don't want to give away the ending but it was really typical. I think Mr. Holmes could have put a little more thought into this book. There were times when I had to make myself finish a chapter and not throw the book to the side and start another one. Don't take my word for it though, read the book and see what you think."
3,very good,this was a very good read. i think they should've done more to Kat and Tender should've been smart enough to figure out what Kat was doing with the money she was giving her for Goldie. that's why it get's only 3 stars (which is still good). however the ending WAS something that i love about books and movies...it was UNEXPECTED!! Tender should've done it though...definitley!!
2,Not for everyone,"I could not get past the stilted ""ebonics"" in this book. While it is indeed a reality that some folks speak this way, I feel that Mr. Holmes could have portrayed the essence of that without actually mispelling the words...it made the dialogue seem fake and forced. Also, the sex in the book was particularly gratuitous, giving the novel a pornographic feel...there are more subtle and powerful ways to portray things other than graphic descriptions. It was difficult to feel anything for the chracters because of the dialogue and Mr. Holmes' penchant for graphically describing every sex scene. It was a worthwhile and necessary story to tell but could have been told in a different manner."
3,Book waz Al'rite.......,"The book started off real interesting, and maybe that's why it had it's down fall some. Cause usually when a book starts off good, it ends up slowing down or being boring all together. Shannon Holmes is a great writer 'B-More Careful' is a great example. But with this book it seems like he didn't take all that much time with it, but of course, he'll have a comeback, as great of writer he is."
4,A very good read,"I finished this one in one day...it was excellent. Exciting, packed with drama, and suspenseful. I would highly recommend."
4,1ST OF ALL SHANNON HOLMES IS A HEEEE NOT! SHEEE,"IIGHT BAD GIRLZ IS A TITE BOOK ONLY THING I DIDNT LIKE ABOUT IT WAS THA RESEMBLANCE TO PLAYERS CLUB EVEN THO I COULD TELL HE TIRED HARD NOT TO IT WAS STILL GOOD I LIKE HOW HE KEPT IN PRESENT DAY TIMES N NOT IN THA 80""S N DID RESEARCH I DO RECCOMEND THIS BOOK TO ALL BLACK SISTAS N MAINLY THA ONES WHO FELL LOST N WANT TO TURN TO FAST LIFE AS COMFORT ""HOLLA BACK AT YA GURL"""
3,Very informational with many tables of research results!,"This book was very informational for research on lesbian parenting. The research was conducted in the United Kingdom, therefore the subjects interviewed were all British. This book gave a realistic overview of the adverse effects on child development as well any postive effects.This book seemed to be more objective on the subject, with clynical results. At times, the book was somewhat ""dry"", but most detailed research material is ""dry"" in nature.Mona, Employee, Student, Mother & Wife"

Nominated for everyone, especially to fans of the work of Gloria Estefan. Check it!"
5,No Reviews?,"I never write review about anything, but if no one else is going to I have to take this opportunity to say that this is a great album, and a personal favorite from my days tending counter in a Santa Cruz head shop circa 1991. Ungowa!"
5,Says it all before you write a word!,"Ladies, you know it all, do it all, have it all (what's important, anyway) and isn't it time you kept in touch with your other super-pals in a way that says it all?Just forget that amateur email stuff (just so ten-minutes ago) and step into the age of WONDER!"
3,Didn't really care for,"I was diagnosed with MS and was told to start a healthy diet so I got this book. Well the more I read the more I knew that I could not do this. It does give you some helpful info on MS but as far as the diet, it is hard to stick to."
1,MS Recovery Diet,"This book was really a waste of money. It is latgely anecdotal with little evidence. The recipes are very American with measurements in ounces and pounds and food that is not available easily.The concept of low fat and reduced red meat is very well discussed in the evidence based science in various science journals - so I do not dispute that. But this is very condescending and out of touch with modern processes of recovery and patient autonomy. I wish I had spent my money on something else - don't waste your time or money. Just reduce your fat intake and give up all rubbish food in your diet and back off from red meat, eat more fish and vegetables. Also eat 5 small meals/day instead of 3 with snacks between."
1,ms,lousy a complete mis-representation of the bookdissappointed i thought i am gonna get info but didn'twould very much like to return it
3,"Good, but outdated","Diet advises have come a long way since then. Yes, low fat is good, but there is more to that.Besides that I found the book to be a little too technical and somewhat depressing. Words like "" debilitating"" and ""degenerating"" are abound and I just refuse to think of my body in those terms.It went a lot in depth on what was believed to be the specifications on dis-ease, but again, research has come far since then"
3,The Multiple Sclerosis Diet Book,I believe this book to be outdated. I was expecting a more holistic approach to the food choices.
5,Hope for the MS at loss patient,This book helped me get over my deep fear of being diagnosed with MS. I know I can change the way I eat and might can keep this disease from getting the upper hand. I feel like its a GODS send and really worth a try. I would mention it to any one with a new (or old) MS diagnoses.
3,Good but somewhat outdated,"This is a very informative book filled with valuable information on MS and the scientific knowledge it conveys is eye opening. However, there is some information that is now outdated and dome of the printing was ordinary."
4,Informative but dated,"This book contains much informative information regarding research findings of Dr. Swank over the years. Some information is still applicable, but this book is rather old and updated information is lacking. This is a good reference book and an interesting theory on diets for MS. However, if you would like the most current information on MS, it's best to look elsewhere."
1,Ridiculous,"This book infers that you are your disease. Sleeping 1-2 hours a day is ridiculous. The book even advocates pretty much ""taking to your bed"" rather than having an active full life. I was so apalled by the outdated ridiculous notions perscribed by this book. I cannot believe it is still being published. Healthy diet, exercies and vitamins are great! This diet will NOT cure MS or stop it's progression, and implying that it will is a disservice to those who are desperatly hoping for a ""cure."""
1,"Bupkus, absolute bupkus",Don't be fooled. No conclusive long-term studies done in the proper scientific method have yet proven that this or any other diet works to control MS.
5,Finding the language for your soul,"When I was younger, I wrote poetry all of the time, but it was a very intimate, secret self who wrote those poems. As I grew up, I thought that the angst of my earlier days was best bottled away. One day, at 45, I started to develop stress-related illnesses and had to find a way to re-connect with who I really am, find a way to figure out what is real and what is pretense. Enter this book. My earlier poems, luckily still stored away in a file in my home, told me what I used to know, and in writing poems for today, I can celebrate the journey since then.I wish I could meet the author of this lovingly written adventure/book --he impresses me, through his own poetry and his writing, as someone who can accept people as they are and then gently, patiently, invite them to find their own voice and grow."
3,Not So Great,This book was described as being in good condition. It is actually in fair condition. The cover shows that the book has been through a lot of wear. Not totally pleased with this purchase.
4,Artsy Brilliance,"It's rough at first, but a unique classic that will be stuck in your head for years if you give it a chance. Schitzophrenic, obnoxious, evil, hilarious, mean-spirited, and adorable... and it's nothing like Mr. Bungle, aside from the attitude."
4,Solid quality,"Working in law enforcement, this watch provides durability in an ever changing environment. I wear it daily while on the job and have no complaints about the style, quality, and performance."
1,Armitron watch,"How do you set it ? (No instructions)Analog and digital times an hour apart.Clutzy, uncomfortable band.I keep it on the dresser , rather than wear it."
3,"Rugged, comfortable strap, but very tall","Not much to say that has not already been said. It is a good, functional watch. Dial is easily read, functions work. The main surprise with this watch was just how tall it sits on your wrist. Take a look at the third amazon picture (sideways view), and you'll get a small idea of if. I'ts a medium sized watch, but it sits so high off the wrist it bangs into things constantly. If you have very large, beefy wrists, this will be great. If you have smaller wrists, you may not like this."
5,Great outdoor watch,"I bought this mainley for hunting and fishing. So far the performance is great, the dials glow in the dark which is great in low light."
5,I know what time it is without pulling out my phone!!!!!,"Actually as far as watches go I REALLY like this one. The strap is very comfortable and the fit is great. The look of the face is almost ""Modern Steampunk"" I kinda made that up. I seriously like the over all look of the watch. In the daylight the background reflects the light to make it look like the light is on and at night the light is not too dim or too bright, just right and it doesn't stay on long which I really like also. Honestly for a watch under $50 this would make me happy. At $28.90 I am even happier...."
4,Armitron Watch,I like this watch very much because it has both analog and digital features. The watch proves to be very accurate and reliable. The extreme thickness of the case is my only objection.
2,Lots of Potential Little Delivered,"The sound quality is awful. It is produced in a laisssez faire way which doesnt do justice to the haunting story. The owner speaks alot and appears to have age onset memory issues. Again, a more sophisticated production would have been so much more enjoyable- something scripted regarding the history and haunting incidences and then may be a third of the time on the various knocks and bumps you hear throughout the production."
3,The background to the Ancient Ram Inn,"This video is mostly taken up with interviewing the owner of the Ram. It doesn't show an investigation, as such but will be of interest to those who have heard of the Ancient Ram Inn or seen it investigated by other paranormal groups."
5,Great science in plain English,"I love this book. In my job I need technical and reference information. I find it in the Appendix, the sections for ""chemistry buffs"" and its the many scientific and Internet references. I use the book not only to learn about vitamin E, but also to get background information on nutrition, diet, aging, exercise and many diseases. I find it in plain English and is fun to read, full of real life stories and, something you do not find in health books, real humor."
4,The Vitamin E Factor,"This book was clearly written, very informative and helpful. I was recently diagnosed with breast cancer and have been researching vitamins and organic foods. I was able to find the information I was looking for in The Vitamin E Factor."
3,Good info in here...,"The annotations are great and clarify the text. The side column cross-references are very handy, and these are very hard to find in a NRSV! Good maps and excellent glossary.My one complaint: the print is very tiny. It makes my eyes hurt. But I love this Bible so much that I purchased a magnifying page for it. It's a little problematic. So, if you're willing to either buy a magnifier or to damage your eyesight, then this Bible is worth it! I'm not kidding...the print is teeny tiny!"
3,Decent reference bible,"I really am liking the NRSV of the Bible and really wish there was a conservative study bible that used this translation. This study bible is liberal in theological orientation like the Oxford Annotated, although not as radical. The notes are not as extensive and more to the point, also. The Apocrypha is not included but is available separately, which is a plus.The margins are wider than most, but the annotations are along the side, not the bottom. If you find a page that does not have a lot of side notes, then you have some marginal space. If there are notes, then the margins are greatly decreased. The print is small, but clear. The paper is fairly thick and good for underlining. The Cambridge and Oxford bibles are better bound and more durable for the money than most others like Zondervan or Nelson, and I appreciate this.."
4,Great version,I love this version of the bible because it stays very close to the original word while still being easy to read. The notes in this bible are bad and so I only use this bible for note taking. This is a great note bible with a great translation.
1,Disappointed,"I was very disappointed. It might be a book with nice drawings, but its grayish colors would not attract little kids at all. Kids likes bright and mild colors with simple but big and clear explanation words.I am now wondering how should I sell it to somebody else so I can get some money back to buy some other picture books for my son."
3,Too Journalistic,"While this book brought up some interesting topics, it was too journalistic to be considered a serious scientific commentary. Maybe if it had been written by a scientist, or if I wasn't a scientist, I would have enjoyed it more. I did find it reasonably interesting, but not particularly compelling. I get the idea that this sort of psycho-babble is becoming popular, and pseudo-informed books like this are ten-a-penny. Science for the masses maybe, but not for the scientific."
1,swivel fork doesn't do its job,"I thought this fork had a great concept and would help my 90 yr old mother with wrist inflexibility to deliver food to her mouth--in practice tho', the swivel is a detraction since it's hard to spear food and when the fork is finally raised to the mouth (often w/much effort), it takes an extra effort to overcome the swivel to get the food into the mouth. Maybe a fixed angled fork would work better for special-utensil-needs folks."
3,Flashbacks,"Wow. As teenager in the 70's, a promo tour for See Forever Eyes was my first concert. I thought they were musical giants, with deep poetry and powerful melodies... Sigh.With 25 years of hindsight and maturity, the music is no longer sophisticated but it's still fun. The vocals and tunes are typical of 70's pop-rock (with some elements of bubblegum pop), and take you back to that era when mainstream rock (and the AOR FM stations that played it) was transitioning to Top 40.Again -- a fun cd. Don't buy it if you're looking for artsy rock or powerful guitar riffs. But if you want an example of popular tunes from the late 70's, this isn't a bad example."
1,GARBAGE: BREAKS INSTANTLY- DO NOT BUY!,"I purchased two of these chairs in August 2007. Within minutes of sitting on both, they broke in the same place. I am a 170 pound male. I noticed the problem could be fixed with a heavier bolt purchased from Home Depot, so I reinforced both chairs. I then took one of the chairs to the beach and it broke in a second place that is unfixable. THESE CHAIRS ARE GARBAGE! DO NOT BUY THEM."
3,zip drive,The drive didnt work - got my money back they were very nice - still waiting for a new one they said they were sending 3 months ago?
4,THE COVER IS AWFUL BUT THE BOOK WORKED FOR ME!,"Darius Collins is a stern taskmaster but even he does not deserve the kind of onslaught that fate deals out to him. His girlfriend dumps him, his son gets into trouble and his ex-wife has serious problems that affect him continuously. How Darius navigates his way through this mountain of problems is what this book is all about. I learned a lot about campus politics and enjoyed reading about a good black man. Just wish Darius would show his softer side a little more often. A great read!"
4,i like it,"Professor Darius Collins is having a rough time. His girlfriend dumps him, he has a political and racial confrontation at work,his ex wife is a trouble maker and his son is really big trouble, and that's just the start of the book. I really enjoyed this character and reading about how goes about putting his life back in order and trying to save his son. Darius Collins is a refreshing character. He's a highly educated, serious man whose got the guts to do the right thing even though it's going to cost him. Freddie Lee Johnson has a real winner in this book."
4,Like It A Lot,A good pass time book...took me a while to read it. Unlike Freddie Johnson other books I finish within 6 days max. Yet it's still good.
3,Lackluster Reading,"Let me start by saying I thoroughly enjoyed Bittersweet. I did not like A Man Finds His Way. First of all, this book was too long. It was over 340 pages. The first chapter was hilarious. But the excitement did not return until the last one hundred pages.At the conclusion of the book, I was left wandering what happened with the Middle Passage club and the CBHS. Also, the book did not address whether Cookie felt remorseful about how her relationships impacted Jarrod's behavior."
3,serrated rocker knife,"a stroke causes me to eat with only my left hand. this knife as is is not sharp enough to cut meat, but i hope a grinding wheel can fix that, which means i'll have to be real careful with it."
1,Not a good book at all. 18th april 2004.,"I hate any of the horrible histories or the knowledge books, even though they might have interesting facts in them,i still think they are just silly jokes and facts. The setting of each page reminds me of a FUNNY paged comic. They seem silly and boring, i couldn't sit down and waTCH A BOOK LIKE THIS, TOTALLY BORING AND NOT MY STYLE."
5,Top Notch Dramatization!,"Ten years in the making, 26 hours of content, and much of it shot on location, each of the 12 DVDs of the New Testament is brought to you word-for-word through a dynamic combination of video, text, narration, music and sound effects. For the broadest reach it uses the Contemporary English Version.MARKBeginning with the baptism of Jesus in the Jordan River by John the Baptist, Mark is packed with stories that demonstrate Jesus really is the Son of God - with power over death, disease and the devil. Because Jesus spoke and acted with divine authority, his ministry amazed his followers and the crowds who were with him. His parables and teachings filled them with wonder as Jesus taught about God and his kingdom.Inspiring original music was composed to underscore the entire production. Mark can be watched and read word-for-word in only two hours. (Part One: 64 min. / Part Two: 60 min.) DVD Region:Region 1 - USA and Canada Only"
1,"Learning to See Creatively: Design, Color & Composition in Photography","This book was almost a complete waste of money. I did learn few composition techniques, but these techniques were in another book that I purchased at the same time as this one."
1,Excellent Book,"Author is extremely creative photographer, and book is well written. Great for the amateur photographer who wants more from their photos."
3,brief review,i'm an amateur that want to improve his compositional skill and i found this book a bit superficial. beautiful photos and a brief narration of the background that to shot involves; nice hints to shot similar photos but no more. i found understanding exposure of the same author a far lot better to maintain title promises.
2,Creative Seeing for Beginners/Entry Level,"The book contains attractive photographs, but is lacking in content, perhaps aimed at those just getting started in photography."
2,Too much over lap with Brian's other Books,"I loved ""Understanding Exposure"" by Brian Peterson. Very good read and very helpful as a beginner. I felt like this book didn't provide me the insights I was looking for. I felt as though the information was regurgitated with a slightly different twist. Maybe my expectations were too high.And as far as the examples in the book, I felt like the creativity was obvious. Old French Countryside Meadows in full bloom is beautiful and creative no matter who is taking the photo. I wanted something more realistic, like how to go about making everyday things in normal town, USA look creative."
4,A place to start,"Certainly one book on photographic creativity will not turn you into an artistic genius, but Bryan Peterson's book will certainly get your artistic juices flowing and give you some impetus towards beginning to be more creative. The photographs presented as examples in the book are lush and invite you to pursue being more creative."
4,Interesting poits of view,"The autor shows his way to be ""creative"" in the photo stock agencyes world.It's not so simple to understand and use all his tips, but it is a great beginning point."
2,Rehash of other his books,"This book reads like an abbreviated version of his other books: Understanding Shutter Speed and Understanding Exposure (which I have both) crammed into one book. I purchased this book expecting to learn to See Creatively, Design, Color & Composition. What I found was photographic basics, lens choices, depth of field, shutter speed, etc etc. It is not the advanced design and composition I was hoping for. Frankly there are better(more in depth)books out there for beginners. Bottom line don't waste your money."
5,Great for taking your photos to next level,Great ideas and an easy way to take your game to new level. A book you can come back to and back to over again. Something to keep close by for review. Peterson is a wonderful writer taking complex ideas and breaking in down to easy bites.
5,Get the Creative Juices Flowing,I purchased this book on the recommendation of a podcaster I follow and was not at all disappointed! Bryan Peterson does a great job of giving the reader lots of ideas in many aspects of photography on how to make more original images. Excellent book for photographers at all levels. The images in the book are wonderful and give the reader a good idea of how to improve his/her own images.
5,Incredible Read!,"I would recommend this book to anyone starting off in photography.Invaluable information, well presented, and easily referenced."
5,this is great!,This is great! My boyfriend loves this and actually depends on it when he gets muscle tension.It requires very little leverage to really get in to the tight spots. Great for all those spots around the shoulder blade. It is like a deep tissue massage - very direct pressure- don't get it if you don't like that intense pressure.
5,AWESOME,The back buddy is great for reaching the areas on the back that need worked on. I use it mainly to massage the knots in my back muscles to relieve migraines. Awesome product. I even ordered one as a gift(: Th Jr is ok. I take it to work for that occasional pressure point (-:
3,ok,"The small one is not shaped well for the use I expected. I hoped to be able to have a more portable version for travel or keeping at the office, but the shape doesn't provide great leverage. I have an ""S"" curve one and that is fabulous. I'm giving the larger one to a friend who borrowed my ""S"" and I'm sure she will like it fine."
4,Baby's First Library Set,"Package came quick and in good packing. Books are great, my little one is 6mths and doesn't really care for them too much. But hopefully they will grow on her. :)"
3,"I know its a clasic, but eh...","2 or fewer stars for our family, but 3 or so based on the fact that everyone else likes the stories. The board books are as any board book is: stiff and difficult to turn the pages, but well constructed, I propose.This rarely-to-never gets read at our house. The books are nice enough, just not favorites. The Runaway Bunny and Big Red Barn are the ones we like the best of the group. Goodnight Moon has only been read once or twice."
4,"Great books, disappointing format.","I love Goodnight Moon and Runaway Bunny, and read them to my daughters when they were little nearly every night. I purchased this set as a gift for my expectant daughter to carry on the tradition. I was very disappointed, however, when the books arrived and found they were the thick cardboard style instead of the softcover I thought I was getting. I did not find anywhere in the description or following reviews that this wasn't a softcover book set. I would have preferred buying separately if I could have gotten what I wanted. Nevertheless, the books are still going to be great for my granddaughter, and next time I will purchase in person so I get what I'm looking for."
5,A peek into a child's world,"Although these books were first written about 40 years ago they are still fresh and new for each child to discover. The author allows the reader a peek into the world of our children; sweet and endearing. These books now available in board book format for the youngest listeners are the perfect bedtime books to soothe a youngster off to sleep. ""Runaway Bunny"" assures each child of the parent's unconditional love. ""Goodnight Moon"" not only offers a sweet way to say goodnight to familiar objects, but may even help establish a bedtime ritual that will help your child get ready for sleep, and ""Big Red Barn"" offers a perfect introduction to animals; their sounds and families. All in all this collection makes a great addition to a well established children's library, or a great foundation."
3,"Calculus, or not?","This video was pretty good except for the fact that it contained the simple calculus, not the difficult calculus. Topics such as trigonometric differentiation, limits involving trigonmetric functions, trigonometric integrals, as well as some important rules for finding derivatives and antiderivatives were left out. This information that was left out is vital for getting an ""A"" in your calculus class. The Standard Deviants should have also included more Reimann sums; there was only one Reimann sum example!"
3,"Decent introduction, good for review","Standard Deviants video has some errors in the video, so be aware of that when watching the video. Other than that, it was a good overall review video, but not enough to get an A in a Calculus course from watching the video alone. You will need to read the book in your class. My suggestion , take examples from the book, and then when you can't solve them, use the tape to maybe help you familiarize with steps prior that are usually overlooked in textbooks."
5,A Great Review Item,"If you want to make an 'A' in your class, work lots of problems. Meanwhile this video will help you better understand what you are doing. Not to mention that when you need a review all you need to do is pop in the video and the information will all come back to you; that is if you worked the problems of course."
2,Tailight,"I bought this for my husband for his hitch kit light connection. We never used it. All the items were there, but it was not compatible with his SUV set up. We mailed it back and the company promptly refunded the amount. We were satisfied with the service."
5,Excellent Service With Amazon,The Hoppy Converter was brand new with a great price. I was replacing one that I have had for several years and was going bad. Quick delivery.
3,Mary Kay Eye Primer,It's not as good as the original. My eye shadow creases by mid-day with this one and it didn't with Mary Kay's original.
5,"Smart, Funny and Sweet","I loved this movie. Mark Scharbo is a sweet, driven guy with a mission. Its great to see his circle of friends and family in action around him helping him to realize his dream. Mike Schank(sic?) steals the show as the lovable burnout. Mark's friends and aspirations may remind you of some of your own. Buy this movie!"
4,A balanced approach,"The trailer for this film did make it seem a lot funnier than it really was, but I was not disappointed by the film. Mark Borchardt's drive and confidence will amaze you and, most likely, annoy you, as well. He seems like the guy you'd love to meet at a party, but would hate to have as a neighbor. A lesser documentarian would have limited this film to Mark's manic creative drive and not shown us how he is often a burden to his parents, siblings, friends, and children."
5,ONLY IN AMERICA,"This is the funniest thing that I have ever seen! Just see the damn movie. Everyone else can tell you what it's about, all I'm saying is see this movie immediately! You won't believe that people like this actually exist out there. Oh my god take my word for it, you'll be a better person if you check out this movie."
5,One of the best American films in the last 5 years,"I absolutely love this film. When it came out in the UK a year or so ago it was a real struggle to find a cinema that was showing it. Thankfully, after plenty of hunting around, my friends and I found a small 'Arts Theatre' that showed films such as this. Never, NEVER have we laughed out loud so many times and for so long! Was it for real? Was it a spoof? We weren't sure at times, but we loved the characters and we loved the films heart. It truely does orbit its own weird little planet. By the end of the film we were standing on our chairs clapping our hearts out as the credits rolled (NOT a common sight over here in the UK).The only thing that bugs the hell out of me is that it isn't available to buy on video over here in the UK!"
3,A eye opening perspective.,I watched this movie with my wife for a class she took. The movie was a bit difficult to follow at first but the movie's outcome was a bit sobering for the main character. The price was very cheap for the film and this was my first film I watched from Amazon. Cool process.
1,American Movie? or Once is too many!,"If you loved Waiting for Guffman and Best in Show, this movie was made in the style of both. However, bad acting and silly lines will having you wondering who thought this was funny. Save your money and check out a Christopher Guest film instead. Two thumbs down!"
4,A treat,"Lots of fun, although guilt will start to overwhelm your conscious as you continually laugh at these painfully sincere guys. And as for the ""questionable"" route Mark chooses to take to make it big.... I can think of two recent filmmakers who have done alright for themselves after making a low budget horror flick. Does The Blair Witch Project ring a bell?"
5,I can't believe it's not a mockumentary,"Real life story of a ... alcoholic dude named Mark Borchardt who lives to make movies. It's heartbreaking and uplifting at the same time, just like life. The movie reminded me of accounts I read about Raymond Carver or Franz Kafka who were compelled to write, even though at times, their prospects of success seemed non-existent. So it is a film more about the artistic impulse than anything else. I think the strength of the film is that you could feel the genuine affection and understanding the filmmaker of ""American Movie"" had for the filmmaker of ""Coven"" and vice versa. I think this is why Borchardt allowed his flaws and incompetencies to be shown. And his friend Mike Schank, a recovering substance abuser, is an absolute hoot everytime he's on screen! A uniquely bizarre person I found much empathy for as well. You know how good this movie is? At the end of the film, my friend thought this was a 'mockumentary' a la ""This is Spinal Tap""."
3,It was OK,"Well I couldn't really get into this one, I think I bought it because of the hype around it, I'll learn not to do that again!"
2,Depressing and bleak.,"Although there were parts that were funny, my overall impression of ""American Movie"" was one of sadness mixed with an overwhelming feeling of guilt. I wanted to turn it off, but I was glued to the TV in horror. Interesting to see other people's interpretations of this film, but I still can't give it more than two stars. (And that's really being generous, I think.) Blech."
1,American movie,"I bought this DVD because the movie got 5 star average rating and was critically acclaimed. What a mistake! If you love the Blair Witch Project and similar movies, go ahead and buy it, otherwise don't bee fooled by the reviewers. The movie is not particularly funny at all (hilarious according to several reviewers). Some reviewers were suggesting Oscar nomination for best documentary, I have seen much more interesting and better documentaries of ordinary people, this wasn't very interesting. Perhaps you have to be an American (or grow up in the USA) to see the funny in an american movie with the american dream that unsuccessfully is trying to make films and doesn't succed with his life?"
1,American Movie DVD,"This piece of ""poor taste & judgement"" (insert your word here) isn't worth the plastic it was burned on. I just can't believe it was critically acclaimed. It makes me ashamed to be from Waukesha County WI."
5,Awesome!,"I loved this movie! I enjoyed getting to know everyone in the movie personally. I especially loved ""Uncle Bill""! This movie reminds me a lot of my husbands early endeavors to make a movie, involving everyone from friends to family of friends and beyond!"
5,The American Dream,"Mark Borchardt is one driven individual and this film which documents his quest to finish his short movie, Coven (pronounced COE-ven)and ultimately his longer feature, Northwestern, succeeds wonderfully. The manic Mark, his skeptical and fading uncle Bill, and the former ""Blotter"" gulping Mike Schank are all hillarious and at the same time poignant characters involved in this daunting struggle. The DVD version of this documentary includes the entire half hour movie, Coven, (a raw, knee-slappingly satiric examination of addiction therapy in B/W) as well as commentary by the filmmakers and edited scenes. This is one of my favorite documentaries, on a par with ""Crumb"", which I thought was kind of similar. In my opinion, this visual slice of life reveals more about the American Dream than all the other Hollywood drivel combined."
4,Excellent Diary of Film-maker/Madman/Genius,"This is a very impressive and funny documentary of a film-maker, Mark Borchardt at Northwest Productions, as he makes a short horror film, Coven, and as he starts work on his opus, a six-year-plus production called Northwestern.The episodes in the documentary are fascinating, realistic, tragic and funny. Imagine working on a horror movie with your mother behind the camera as you smash your head into a kitchen cupboard to avoid being stabbed.This would be great for any film buffs or people with bizarre taste.Lots of laughs and insights."
4,These Guys Need A Two Disc Set,"Good up until their 1995 release of ""Join The Band"", this Japanese release only covers a small portion of their career best works. The same is true of their 1999 ""Greatest Hits"" CD. One standout though, is track #15 I Will Always Love You. Rarely found outside of Japan, and beautifully arranged. It's about time for at least a two disc, ultimate collection release from this talented award winning group."
3,Mostly fits,"The spade ends fit my new Pioneer speakers just fine, but the ""factory-compatible"" side was totally the wrong connector for my 1998 Pontiac Sunfire. I ended up making it work by cutting off the lock and key tabs from the car's connector and putting a ziptie around the connection, but this of course is less than ideal. I suppose that the word ""select"" excludes my vehicle, but it would have been nice to have a listing of what this product was compatible with before I bought it."
5,Does the Job,"I got this harness to adapt a normal car speaker to my Volvo truck. I could have spent a lot of time tracking down the correct clips and fittings on line or driving to several stores, but this saved me a lot of time and money just to buy the harness from Amazon's site."
2,A bit thin...,"This is a collection of academic articles describing various aspects of business intelligence. Allthough the articles are interesting in themselves, the title of the book hints at a more hands-on approach than actually found in the text. Also the Accounting and Finance perspective is marginally represented, with no more than parts of two chapters devoted to the subject. I would say that about 60% of the book is an introduction to the world of business intelligence giving a birds eye view of subjects like ETL, OLAP and datawarehousing. 30% of the book is about more or less related subjects like the business reporting xml schema. Finally about 10% of the book actually handles accounting and finance. I was a bit disappointed."
2,"Not as good as ""Tacky Fingers""","This stuff just gets your fingers wet, and the water evaporates off your fingers quickly, so you have to continually be sticking your fingers back in the stuff. The brand ""Tacky Fingers"" is a lot better. It gets your fingers a little bit sticky and it lasts awhile."
5,This reference book is the best!,"As you know, there are many tricky and picky questions in a TOEFL test. This reference book is the best preparation book for the kind of questions. I got high score with this book. If people read this book, they can get used to solving questions in a TOEFL test. With the CD-ROM, people can practice diagnostic tests. The tests are similar to a real TOEFL CBT test."
1,Cracking the Toefl,"This book is only good for computer test, it has small computer shots with one question and answers on each page, so although it has lots of pages, they are quite waisted on useless computer shots/pictures that you can view on CD prep. This book does not prepare you for the paper based exam, because it doesn't present the reader with enough printed exersises."
4,"Dangerous, but definitely Passionate","Loure Bussey does a wonderful job of showing the love between Marita and Shemar. The combination of their love story and the complexities of the danger that surrounds them, makes for a great combination."
4,"Loving again, and trusting again.",Shemar Dalton thinks Marita is a gold digger and Marita is trying to piece her life together after being fired from her job as an attorney. She goes to Bermuda for some R&R and ends up falling in love and having to fight for her life. Book has a lot of passion and I actually give this book 4.5 stars.
1,THE SOURCE OF MY STRENGTH,"TO THIS DATE 07/30/2008 I HAVE NOT RECEIVED MY BOOK, MAYBE IF I EVER GET IT I CAN GIVE A REVIEW."
5,The Source of My Strength Relying on the Life-changing Power of Jesus Christ to Heal our Wounded Hearts,"This book was recommended to me by an individual I trust. Alot of the book was not relevant to me and my situation, but I'm glad I read the entire book. It was a relatively easy read and quite inspirational!"
2,Pulp Fiction,"This is a wonderful book for someone who would like to have the impression that they understand something about magic. The problem with this book is its vast incompleteness. The author would have the reader performing invocations of spirits half way thru the first chapter. Invocations are dangerous and can ruin lives. If you are interested in this subject matter you can find the same (basically Golden Dawn hermeticism and caballah) in introductory books and move a long a little at a time. ""The Golden Dawn"" by Israel Regardie covers this same material in much more detail along with ways that one can protect one's self from setbacks. There aren't any quick ways to learn magick right, but Mr. Conway would have you believe differently. I don't want to call him an opportunist, but...."
1,Damaged Disks,How can I review three disks that were so badly scratched that they are unplayable and which arrived badly packaged without their disk cover properly inserted?
3,"Fun, but kinda pointless","We picked this game up recently, since it sounded like a lot of fun. I love reading about urban myths, so I thought this would be a blast.It's fun, but...I dunno, I need something that raises the bar a bit.You travel around some squares and someone reads you what could or could not be an urban myth. Then everyone votes on whether or not they think it's true. The answer true or myth is revealed, and everyone moves, or doesn't move if they've gotten it wrong, and play continues.We recently bought a pile of board games, including Cranium, Scene It, Trivial Pursuit (can't remember which edition, but it's in a gold box), and Urban Myth, and Urban Myth is the one we've played least. Not that it isn't fun and interesting, it just isn't AS fun and interesting as others."
1,A HORRIBLE Game!!!,"A group of friends and I played this game at a party and only a couple questions in, we thought an answer just didn't sound right. We looked it up and the game was WRONG. So after that, we would look the answers up, and 8 times out of 10, the game was WRONG. If you want to actually learn, do NOT get this game!"
2,Not really 2 packs,"While I was excited to get this product at such a great price, I only got 1 bottle. When I called amazon and the company they said it was supposed to be just one bottle but was mislisted. The company refused to send me another bottle and would only refund me half the purchase price. I will be sure never to purchase from this company again!"
2,Great idea bad product,"I got these cups for my 15 mo old son. I thought that they would be great, a nice cup to take with us when we go out that I would not mind if we lost. I bought two packs and opened them right up, wash them, and then handed one to my son while he was sitting at the table. Not even two seconds later he had pulled the cap off and dumped the cup. This would be a great idea if the lids screwed on like the other sippy cups. The lids are really easy to take off. I would not recommend this cup to anyone unless you want a cup that your kids can open and you want to sit right next to them when ever they use this cup. Me I would just rather give him a regular cup he can not make any more of a mess. I love the other take and toss items and an really disappointed in this one."
5,Good basic items,"Great for shipping small ebay items and yarn. The thing that surprised me is that the box for these is not sealed in any way, and it is not a close-fitting lid; when I took it out of Amazon's shipping box, the Quality Park lid fell off and envelopes spilled all over the floor. I suppose there's no reason to think anyone would have swiped a few envelopes before shipping it to me; I'm certainly not going to sit here and count them to check. Anyway, they're nearly indestructible and I use them for shipping most things."
5,"Good product, what I expected",This was the first time I ordered Park Tyvek Envelopes. I have been mailing items in them with no problem.I would order again.
1,Wrong product and long delay,"I ordered this and waited 2 weeks to be told that it was out of stock. Weeks later I am contacted and told that it is back in stock. I ordered alcohol-free and received perfume with alcohol. There was no enclosure for returns policy. After all the wait and hassle, I gave my wife what I didn't order and what she really didn't want. In short, I settled out of frustration. But I know better for next time."
5,Nice perfume,"I got this perfume in Orlando at Epcot and love it. As I read the last review was not about the perfume but about the seller. I think this perfume is great, smells really good and lasts all day. It`s not over powering but a nice smell."
5,Great Resource!,The 2nd edition has all the basics of cartography that are needed to create a good map. It is lacking in regards to updated software and visualization techniques but with the basics it has enough to help anyone make a good map get through a cartography class.
5,Thematic Cartography,The book was delivered in the time frame that was given and it was in very good condition. Thank you for selling a great product!
5,Focuses on principles,"Unlike many sports, golf just doesn't come easily with practice. A visit to any driving range will convince you that most folks can't figure out how to hit the ball long and straight. Something in the setup, perhaps the angle down to the ground, causes the vast majority of golfers to miss hit the ball. Usually they slice, over and over again. And even most senior citizens at the range do the exact same thing, even after hitting balls for 40 years. So most people don't figure it out no matter how many balls they hit.This author's explains and demonstrates the principles of golf so that you can have a decent chance at actually improving your swing. And this 45 minute video gets you working on the key elements of a correct grip, stance, back swing, weight shift, and release. If you've been practicing without seeing results then you probably need to review this tape and focus on the drills. If you skip the drills you will likely not grasp the significance of the instruction."
1,Save you time and money,Poorly produced and a poor narration. Looks and feels like it was made in someone's basement in 20 minutes (30 if you didn't know how to use a video camera.) The secret is not a secret but a rehash of a traditionally taught (hitch hiker) motion. I would have returned this video but the rules say if you view it you own it.
2,These shocks are terrible! VERY Rough Ride...,"I had to purchase shocks last minute during a leveling kit installation on my 2002 Ram 2500 Diesel, and while I knew they were inexpensive I didn't think they could possibly make the ride this bad. These shocks are MUCH WORSE than the stock shocks I pulled out.The ride is so bad that the next investment for my truck will be a nice set of Bilsteins.The only pros I see are that they were easy to install and came with more hardware than was needed. Either spend a bit more on some better shocks or leave your originals in rather than purchasing these."
1,Lacking quality,"I ordered this on a Monday and received it 16 days later. It should not have taken that long.The packaging was terrible. The two largest sizes were stacked; everything else was thrown on top. There was yellowish glue on the outside of many of the boxes, making them unusable. I tried to clean it off, but it is permanently stuck. The dimensions of the inner and outer shells do not work well with each other. Some are hard to open and some fall apart. I had to sort through them and pick out the ones I could use. Here are statistics for which ones were NOT USABLE:Long ...... 45% damagedBig ........ 30% damagedRegular .. 15% damagedSmall ..... 40% damagedTiny ...... 75% damaged (!)Only 59 out of the 100 were usable. I am very disappointed with the quality, especially since I purchased these based on the good reviews.I attached pictures of two major problems with the boxes. One shows a rip that they obviously tried to fix, unsuccessfully, and the other shows the dimension problem."
4,good product,"A no frills, yet sturdy jewelry box. What else can one say? They're jewelery boxes, and they do what they're supposed to do well."
4,Enlightening&respectful bio of an overlooked entertainer,"Carlton Jackson has done a concise, literate job delving into the life and work of Hattie McDaniel. Not only do you get a clear sense of who she was and her talent as a performer, but also of the context and times in which she lived. Jackson sheds much-needed light on a seldom-seen side of Hollywood - the black side - as well as the struggles between commerce & equality that still exist today. Reading about the NAACP protests against Hollywood vis a vis lack of opportunities for blacks is like reading today's headlines. But more importantly, getting a proper sense of who Hattie McDaniel was and her professional legacy are the primary reasons to read this book."
5,"Gritty, biting tone--for 6 bucks!","Put these bad boys on both my Strat and an ES-335. Got the 9's cuz the practice time ain't what it used to be and the fingers have suffered enough.Great sound on both guitars--especially the ES, which gave the round singing humbuckers a little of that Strat bite that was lacking with the D'addario XL's that it came with. If blues is your thing, these are your strings ba-da-da!"
3,Decent strings but a bit stiff,"I just had a guitar setup with DR Pure Blues 9's and they sound pretty good but they are a bit stiff.I've also noticed a bit of what I must presume is the nickel coating seems to come off on my fingertips after practicing for an hour or so.It almost looks like graphite on my fingers but it is nowhere near as ""black"" as the oxidation I've seen from low-quality strings.They also seem to have more ""string squeak"" when changing chords than other brands - even after generously spritzing them withFingerease Guitar String LubricantI am not qualified to say if they truly give you that ""vintage tone"" but they do sound decent.However, for $6 I would rather getDean Markley Blue Steel LT 2552 Electric Guitar Strings (.009-.042)or save some money and go withD'Addario EXL120 Electric Guitar Strings, Super Light, 9-42.EvenErnie Ball Super Slinky String Set (9 - 42)seem to feel better to me, but I am a Da-Dairy-O man, for now."
5,LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS ONE,"HELLO MY NAME IS CHRISTIAN I HAVE A MILYIN OF BARNEY SHRI LEWIS RUDOLPH THE RED NOSED REANDER PLAYHOUSE DISNEY SPOT DISNEY MOVIES ALL DIFRENT ,INDS AND MY SOSTERS ARE WACHING ALL 3 TAPES WHAT DO YOU WANT TO WACH NOW BARNEY SOMGS BARNEYS BEST MANERS BARNEY RIDING IN BARNEY CAR SING AND DANCE WITH BARNEY LAMB CHPPS PASOVER SUPRISE AND LOTS MORE I TOOK THIS TO A SLEPOVER MY AUNT AND MY AUNTS FRIEND LOVED LOVED LOVED THIS VIDEO MY AUNTS FRIEND MARNA Sang and sang to evrything whenever i had a belly ake the song that does ont end would make me fell beater i hope you get this video for ur child"
1,A terrible waste of money!!!,"I've had one for a couple of months, and am VERY disappointed with it. It puts out cool air, but definitely not cold air... Consequently, at best, it can get my bedroom down 10-15 degrees in temp, after several hours of running full blast. (Note that I quickly gave up trying to use it in my livingroom, where it would make almost no detectable change in room temp...)A MUCH better choice I think would be to go with a std window unit (albeit it would be more difficult to install). It would work much better, and be much less expensive as well!!!"
5,"works great, super addition to the kitchen","This small format magnet fits nicely on the side of a cabinet, I put mine right next to the sink over the dish drain. I allows me to wash my knives and immediately hang them to dry in their final positions. No issues with the knives not sticking."
1,Hebrews 9:25-28,"Hebrews 925) Nor yet that he (Christ) should offer himself often, as the high priest entereth into the holy place every year with blood of others;26) For then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world: but now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.27) And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment:28) So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation."
1,Boring and misleading,"I was really excited about getting this DVD and had it on my Christmas list. It was a big disappointment. The quality ia not very good and the content appears to be outdated. I have taken Iridology classes and I was looking for something that would show the Iris and how to look for certain conditions, kind of like a show and tell. Instead, it was an Iridologist practioner who seemed more concerned about talking about how great that he was and how much experience that he had. There were no pictures of eyes. There was just the practioner looking into a patient's eyes and talking about his observations. What a disappointment."
2,Stay Away,"These ""All About"" videos are interesting for kids, but parents will be taken aback. They are ""hosted"" by the very creepy Hard Hat Harry; a strange genie who pops up in the middle of kids playing, and takes them on adventures. I certainly don't want my kids to wander off with some weird guy who invites them to look at trains/cars/etc. Honestly, he strikes my wife and me as a potential molester. Finally, the quality of the videos is lousy: many of them look to be filmed - poorly - in the early 1980's. We are not buying any more of this series, and now have to explain to our kids about talking to strangers."
1,My very last urban novel.,"This is my LAST time buying a so-called urban novel. Is Urban Fiction the bin that publishers throw their trash in these days, hoping to make money on ""those stupid black women?"" I was drawn to the genre by Sistah Souljah's writing (flawed, but riveting). However, too much in this part of the bookstore is like 'Street Level' - faker than a 3-ounce bottle of malt liquor. If you're going to insult my intelligence, don't ask me to pay for the privilege. And please don't further disrespect me by putting out glowing reviews by people who obviously have not read these books. I'm furious."
3,Good but not great,"I found this one in a science fiction bookstore. Having the fantasy elements be stronger and more consistent would have been cool, but otherwise the book was OK (the review ""Puh-leez! This book is a mess"" has some good points about why it's not better than OK). Langhorne did a good job of avoiding most fantasy clichés - for example, this is ""urban fantasy"" without elves all over the place. Unfortunately, the ending was too contrived."
2,Unbelievable waste of time,"This book was a complete waste of time. I was fooled by the description, which sounded far more thrilling then the book actually was. Thank goodness I bought it used. Don't waste your time."
5,Brilliant and effective. A shame it's not available.,"Even the most obscure word, like ""chionophobia"" irrational fear of snow or ""geniculate"" having kneelike knots or joints, becomes transparent with his comprehensive explanations and focused pedagogy. Get it back in print!"
5,A great book,"This is the book for understanding and learning probability! I used this lively introduction to probability in class and I found it a pleasure to read it. The challenging problems and the way they are tackled using computer simulations before providing analytic solutions, gave the students a lot of insights. Also the key concepts and ideas from probability theory are treated in a very clear way. I wished I had seen this book before."
5,for math majors,"The back of the book says ""high school algebra is really all the mathematical background you need"" and ""for students undertaking a first course in probability"". But I disagree, the math is tough for a reader like me who has only taken 1st year university math (I graduated with a finance degree). Another reviewer comments are more accurate: ""not presented at a level that the general reader can understand"" and ""This book is an excellent choice for advanced courses in probability for math majors who have completed the calculus sequence"". I don't mean to disparage the book - especially because I couldn't get through it, but just letting potential buyers know what to expect, so the book can hit it's correct target audience."
4,Just what I needed,This was a textbook for a class. It is just what I needed at almost half the price.
1,Rip Off,"Do not buy this product from this vendor. It's theft. The ad states that you are buying Dog Treats (note plural) and that the shipping weight is over 3 pounds. What you get is just one Greenie, for nearly seven dollars. I returned it immediately. Whoever is selling this is trying to steal from you."
1,Absolute robbery!!!,"The product description states that this is a 3+ pound bag of treats --- it turned out to be a single, individually-wrapped greenie! We're talking a small, single item that weighs less than 2 oz! I made the mistake of paying $7 for a single dog treat! What a joke!!!Fortunately, they credited back my card instantly and Amazon is letting me ship it back completely at their expense. How disappointing! These are my dog's favorites and I thought I was getting a great deal! What a joke!"
3,Not quite what it says it is,"I'd been looking for this book for some time, given its basic plot and the question of how things might have been different for Britain if the transistor was a British invention. Sadly, the book delves very lightly into the subject.The book is really more of a war story about British commandos sent to take out an elite German military unit stationed in France. The whole book is set in the early part of World War II, and never advances to show how the post-World War II globe could have turned out if Britain came out of the war as the world's leading (or only) computer power.The story the book does tell is OK war fiction, but it's barely alternative history."
3,Change color with scalding hot water,"Very cute, seemingly good quality... but I am disappointed at how hot the water must be for the ducks to change color. I am pretty sure my daughter's tub water is as hot as a kid can handle comfortably and the ducks definitely do not change color a bit. I thought they were total lemons until my husband tried putting them in scalding hot water, and they did change colors- which is of no help to my daughter."
4,Ed inspires Us to Live Better with Less Negetive Impact on the Envioroment,"Ed & Rachel did a marvelous show about what measures Ed goes to in order to save money and live with less impact on our enviroment. I was hanging on everything that Ed was trying to say and demonstrate. I would have given this a five star but felt the importance of what Ed was trying to convey was trivialized. Ed is such a profound example for all of us. Being from Southern California can relate to Eds passion about saving endangered species, resources like clean air, water conservation, reusing materials, living with less dependancy on fossil fuels. Please bring season 2 to DVD!."
5,Awesome.,"As an individual who wishes for less consumption, ""Living with Ed: Season 1,"" is a stimulating introductory experience. Ed gives us simple ways to recycle, conserve, and CREATE energy as opposed to consumption. Additionally, it is quite delightful watching Rachel and Ed bicker about their differences in indulgence and practicality. Living with Ed: Season 1 is a must for those who wish for less consumption, and need an introduction to ways we can conserve."
5,Thank you Moiseyev,"Due to ""VIEW Video"" DVD I can relive the unforgottable experience given to me by Igor Moiseyev National Popular Dance Company of the USSR in theyr permformace in Venice, Milan and Trieste too, forty years ago.Not only, due to this DVD, now I can share my wonderful experience with my grandson, family and friends too. Thank you.Giorgio Stern"
1,primitive and boring,"I bought this flick because director's previous is one of my favored movie.Mistake cost me 20 bucks. Now to the point-main chracter chick is ugly and for unexplained reason sleep with two ugly guys one of whom marry her; two kids and ten years later she tells husband one of the kid not his which doesnt suprise husband a bit; then her boyfriend dies from cancer.To add to disappointment colors are way off, imagination zero, operator's work primitive and chick's tits so small you start thinking why."
3,It's a cheap lens,"It's a cheap lens that less than $100, so you get what you pay for. You can find it even cheaper on ebay. It's not going to compare to the quality of a more expensive lens, but it's alright for the price."
3,long lens,"I am a little disappointed with the narrow field of vision, Lens does do what it is intended for must use a tripod or monopod"
3,Stale . . . .,"Unfortunately for me, the cashews and walnuts in all the packages I received were stale. In addition, most of the peaches were dried out (very tough) and some of the apples had dark spots on them despite the fact that sulfur dioxide is used as a preservative. I ordered these 05/07 and the expiration date on the packages was 06/07. I have eaten food products past their ""freshness"" date as long as it still taste good but these did not make it. Amazon customer service refunded my money with no hassles.If these weren't stale, I would consider them an okay snack. I don't rate them 4 stars because there are 300 calories in a package and sulfur dioxide is used as a preservative. However, it would be a better snack for me than a candy bar."
2,received expired/stale,"The order of Peeled Snacks (bing bing cherry variety) that I received today was clearly marked with a sell-by date of 09/25/07, both on each individual package of fruit and on the outside of the box they came in.I was not pleased that Amazon would ship out this product knowing that it was expired. I made one call to Amazon customer service and I had my money promptly refunded for the order, which I was happy with...but it still doesn't really excuse the fact that they shipped expired food. The Amazon CSR assured me that a message was sent to their fulfillment center to investigate the issue. (I noticed in previous reviews that some other people had issues with the freshness of this product as well.) Hopefully that gets corrected soon because I was/am anxious to try the Peeled Snacks that I had heard so much about.My star rating of the product isn't very accurate in regards to the quality of the item itself because I haven't actually tasted it yet due to the expiration issue."
5,Sensational history,"The freshest thing written in years on one of America's most engimatic presidents. Greenberg's book is a model of originality and historical craft. And it's a great read--always smart, often surprisingly funny, and laden with great anecdotes. Anyone wondering how our politics got so distorted should pick this one up."
5,HISTORY AS IT SHOULD BE WRITTEN,"i get tired of all these old fashioned biographies like david mccullough. this book is a lot more interesting. it tells what nixon meant to the people who elected him, and after all the public is as much a part of history as the presidents!the best chapter is the one on nixon and the press. it debunks the idea that the press hated nixon and shows how the press was really lying down on the job during watergate.i recommend nixon's shadow if you want something more interesting and challenging than the usual ""great man"" stuff."
1,Unversal Orange Peeler - less then optimal,"I just received the Universal Orange Peeler and began trying to peel oranges just purchased from Safeway and Costco. My experience so far has been that it DOES NOT WORK. The end of the vice grip nearest the turning handle just digs into the end of the orange boring its way through the peel. Then the juice begins spilling out onto the cutting board. I tried this on at least four oranges before giving up. I would think that your citrus fruit would have to be like rocks before they would stand up to the pressure being applied by the grip attempting to hold the end of the fruit. I guess that is why this product is not sold in PriceGrabber, only Amazon.Com!"
4,thought provoking but opinionated,"I bought this book looking for an interesting and informative discussion on the effects of language, and got just that. Ms. Elgin highlights the many contradictions our culture is grapling with, such as the argument to teach only in English in US schools. She also touches on the controvetial subject of whether or not language shapes our view of reality and approach to life. Despite the interesting subject matter and obvious research that has gone into this book, Ms. Elgin is quick to insert her opinions and just as quick to apologize for them. The book would have been vastly improved if these personal opinions had been eliminated from the text or mentioned in the preface or afterward, not after every new theory is introduced. Altogether an interesting and informative book which must be read with skepticism as it is so strongly opinionated."
1,Watching Paint Dry,"To qoute Gene Hackman's character in the movie ""Night Moves,"" watching this French movie is like ""watching paint dry."" Let me say that I have many French movies among my favorite all-time films: The 400 Blows, Jules and Jim, Amelie, Claire's Knee, and Cesar and Rosalie among them. But this film seems like the type of film, that if filmed by an American director, would be criticized for being obtuse, slow, and lacking clever dialogue and ideas. The whole film relies on--and therefore seems clever due to--the twist at the end of the movie, of which there is little if no foreshadowing provided. However, because it is a foreign film, it seems as if some viewers excuse such flaws. Paint drying, for sure! Disappointed that Roger Ebert liked this film. Maybe watching this movie on-line did it a disservice.Night MovesDay for NightAmelie"
4,Interesting low-keyed thriller,"Just short of a masterpiece, this is an interesting low-octane thriller that works as both an erotic whodunnit and study into the human psyche. LeConte is the master of nuance and though there's not a lot of story going on, the action takes place between silent moments and character restraint. Director LeConte has the gift of capturing human behavior and passion lyrically and poignantly; the film is often touching and rings utterly true. I don't think this could be translatedly effectively into an American film, and once again I tip my hat to the French for capturing the uncapturable. Later LeConte pushes the limits in the sumptious metaphor laden ""The Girl On The Bridge"", an absolutely stunning piece of work."
5,The loneliness cold!,"Based in a Georges Simenon's play , this masterpiece of Patrice Leconte, a middle aged man becomes a true Peeping Tom with the obsessive and non told love. She is involved peripherally in a murder, but the sinister attraction will increase gradually till...This film is extremely related with the Sixth Chapter of Kielowski 's Decalogue and a powerful film that it would be shocking too: Atom Egoyan' s The adjuster although this one runs in other direction and the innocuous, light and narcissist film Silver (1993) .Michel blanc in one of his peak achievements of his career. Provocative and poignant."
2,A slow-paced thriller,"A middle-aged loner tries to blackmail a young woman into loving him, and pays the price. As a detective story, this movie has serious weaknesses, and the pace is slow, but the DVD subtitles are very easy to read. Will at least improve your French. (In addition to the absence of fingerprints and other logical weaknesses noted by reviewers, how did the woman have access to Hire's apartment to plant the purse there?)"
4,Beyond the basics,"This book is not for beginners, but more for those of us that have a lot of unused quilt blocks sitting around. It is also good for the experienced quilter that is board and wants a new twist to making quilt tops."
3,Smashing Sets,This is another quilt book that I haven't used much but have it in my quilting library for future use.
3,Where are You??? Lets Do A Record,Vell its been a long time since we did first album lets do it big this time.Come on in.619 414 6202Rick Aaron IIIA&R; EntertainmentRickAaron3@aol.com
4,Give this album some love,"This Kansas City native is very underated but this sophomore album is slammin from the first track ""Bom Bom"" right to the end. Look for the track ""Keep My Name Out Your Mouth"" with E-40 and B-Legit too."
4,It works....,"It works great. But I can't use the parts coming with the package to connect to my refrigerator, it will leak. So, I have to buy one from the home depot. Other than that, it perfectly fits my need."
5,Excelent product!,"This pump was the solution I was looking for water and ice dispenser in my KitchenAid refrigerator. Install was extremely easy, in less than an hour and was fully operational. Although the instructions indicate that the filter should be removed from the refrigerator, I chose to leave and runs smoothly. It's a great invention!Esta bomba era la solución que estaba buscando para el dispensador de agua y hielo de mi refrigerador KitchenAid. Instalarlo fue sumamente fácil, en menos de una hora ya estaba completamente operativo. Aunque las instrucciones indican que se debe eliminar el filtro del refrigerador, preferí dejarlo y funciona sin problemas. Es un invento genial!"
5,Works Great - Crystal Clear Ice,"We rent and since there was no water hook-up where the fridge goes, we thought we were out-of-luck, until we found this set up. The pump set up was simple, it makes hardly any noise and the end product - water and ice from bottled water as opposed to filtered city water ... priceless! No more sediment floating down through my vodka as the ice melts :-)"
4,float switch issue,"anyone have trouble with the float switch automatic shutoff. If I am not listening when the water bottle gets low, the pump continues to run!! Otherwise it is a great product.."
2,The Vampire Files Continue to Languish,"Blood on the Water is more of the same from the last installment of the Vampire Files. Jack Fleming once again fights the mob, gets his head and body pummeled, and struggles with his vampiric state. That really is the plot. If you've read the last few books, you've read this one too. This series at this point languishes in repetitive plot devices. What kept me reading to this point was I actually like the characters, Charles Escott, Jack Fleming, and Bobbi, Jack's girlfried.Very disappointing."
5,Great book!,"Love this series. Book came promptly, was exactly as described. Good seller. It's a great series if you like your detectives with a bit of fang."
4,Reviewer in PA.,"This book is goood. With Jack's blood thirst getting out of control, and a contract on him Jack has a real problem. Not up to the first book, this is still enjoyable and a read for any Jack Fleming fan."
2,Elegantly Horrifying,"Doing for Demons, what Anne Rice has done for the Vampire, Fowler has created a demonic force that begs a following...Deals with the devil are common enough through literature, however, in this version of the old tales, you can see why one would be willing to make that deal! Spanky is Charismatic, seductive and seemingly innocent enough as 23-year-old Martyn takes 'Spancialosaphus Lacrimosae', his own personal demon up on a little deal guaranteed to sweeten his pathetic life. A tale of demonic possession which gradually turns from good to very, very bad.Spanky brings out the dark unscrupulous side and with Fowler in the control booth, you get your fair share of gore, as the demon collects his due...Never a moments dull reading! An absolute MUST read for horror fans!"
4,Ring - almost complete,"This is a fantastic Ring cycle. Sound concerns (and audience hacking/talking) keep it at 4 stars. Flagstad and Furtwangler alone would make this worth purchase, but add to that the majesterial Wotan of Ferdinand Frantz (not as noble as Hotter, but much more human), Svanholm and Lorenz as Siedgried, and Pernestorfer as Alberich and you have a major ensemble. (Pernestorfer was singing Benoit in Boheme as late as the 1970s).One problem is the cuts. Part of the great monologue in Act two of Walkure is cut (it can be found with Frantz/Furtwangler on two other recordings) and the central portion of the Siegfried / Wanderer scene is shortened - Svanholm shows why at the end of the opera. His duet is lunge as high as you can. But still, it is a great Ring."
4,Company Town,"This is a wonderful collection of poetry. Fragmentary, and highly charged, it is a fictional account of the last days of a Salmon Cannery along the Sheenan River in British Columbia. The narrative takes a number of forms; lists, declarattions, snippets of gossip; but slowly, in their own voices, the miriad characters of the ""Company Town"" step forward, and have their say. The writing is wry and razor-sharp. A wonderful book, a wonderful read, and a fantastic document of the working class experience -- Even if it is fictional!"
5,I Loved It!,"I loved this book because it was real. It told both this teacher's great deeds and the mistakes. While I wasn't laughing out loud, I was chuckling inside. As an eighteen year veteran teacher I could relate to many of his stories."
3,The 2 original songs are worth the price alone,"Most would prefer an all original cd, since their last one came (Belly 2 Belly) came out in 96, but something is better than nothing.Since they are cover songs, it is hard to give a rating, because the opinions will vary. Despite the choices, Warrant did the songs quite well. I probably would have left out ""Hair of the Dog,"" though. That belongs with coverbands who play in local bars.The two original songs deserve a 5 on their own. Sub-Human is great. Could have used a second chorus at the end, however. A nice modern rocker. ""Face"" no-doubt would have done incredible if given a chance with media. Nice acoustic verses, kick in at the chorus, and radio-friendy vocals.I knock off points for ""Hair of the Dog"" and this replacing a full-length original cd."
2,broke upon late arrival,"It was a cheap gift - but it came 3 days late and it was broke. I was able to fix it though with a bit of super glue. Not completely as promised, but all ended well."
4,Great to put papers,"I had it put on the wall and it is great! it holds a lot of paper, plus it is way to cute!"
3,Works For Me!,"Although I am an actor first and foremost, I find learning about the technical aspects of theater is important. This book is helpful in teaching me some important things I need to know about the technicalities of stage construction. A little dated it looks, although flashiness is not a requirement, just sufficient information, and that it has."
5,Sets building,What an excellent source of information and examples of what things should look like. I have used it several times and still see things that inspire even more ways of doing things.
5,Soup to nuts,"This book is a great starting point for both beginner and advanced builder. It has the history of the craft and stages, as well as modern techniques. Welcome addition to any builder's library."
5,Book Saves My Life Over and Over,"This is a great reference book, written in a style that is easy to understand. Has pictures as well. I refer to it often."
4,"Good, but not comprehensive","I just purchased this book, and while I am satisfied with it, there seems to be missing information. I enjoy the background on the history of theatre and some of the detail in the text. However, the author missed giving more depth to the actual procedures section. It seems like the author spent too much time in the early chapters and lost steam when it came to the true content that readers want...how to build scenery. It is a good reference to add to the collection and is good for students who like to read detailed instructions. But for the builder who needs a quick reference, you would be better off with ""The Backstage Handbook"" instead."
1,Don't Waste your $$,"This guy is a BOZO. I had him as my instructor for two classes during my masters program at University of Central Florida. He is boring, dull, insensitive, petty, has class favorites, and decides early in the semester who he will pick-on during class. All in all, he is a perfect example of how tenure keeps the incompetent in a position long after their usefulness is exhausted. Last time I heard, he is retiring soon. For any of his current students, it is not soon enough.PS - The book is poorly written."
5,Outstanding,Great for day or nighttime driving. Really helps to highlight contrast for daytime driving and to be able to pick out the details walking in the woods.
5,Damning,"This book is a very damning look at Ford and Lindbergh, which reveals them both as highly flawed icons who did considerable damage to their country through their flirtation with fascism,. The author, who comes off as quite objective, is careful to emphasize that neither man was a Nazi or a traitor, but because of their status as heroes, they influenced a lot of others into Hitler's camp.The great American historian Arthur Schlesinger Jr. praises this book on the back cover, so i am reasonably sure that it stands up to acdemic scrutiny."
5,"Lindbergh was no hero, no saint","This book presents quite the contrast with A. Scott Berg's apologetic treatment of Lindbergh's Nazi sympathies and nasty anti-semitic views. Backed up by never before revealed documents from Lindbergh's own archgives, the book reveals the pioneer aviator to be an all too human American icon - at times naive, courageous, incredibly stupid, stubborn, principled, and finally pathetic. Very interesting presentation of a complex individual. The prose is a joy to read and never dull, though I wasn't all that interested in Henry Ford, and would have preferred an entire book just dedicated to Lindbergh's Nazi shenanigans."
1,Poorly written and poorly researched,While it is a fascinating topic there are many far better books on the subject.This book is very poorly written and researched.
5,Excellent IT Planning Guide,"This book offers good strategies for implementing VoIP. It covers the feasibility studies required and pre and post evaluation of the network. Technical details are covered well but the most important aspects such as QoS, SLA's are explained in some sort of details, which is an important area when dealing with VoIP.I used this book as one of my main reference in my final year project with UOL BSc in CIS.I recommend this book not just for Engineers, Technicians, Managers and IT staff, but also for anyone wishing to learn about the basis of VoIP."
2,Complicated,"We (five college-educated adults, three with Master's degrees) found this game overly complicated and not very fun. Trivial pursuit is much more fun, and doesn't involve all the money banking. We also found quite a few errors in pronunciations provided--important in a spelling game."
5,All the King's Men for the New Millenium,"This is the best political novel since All the King's Men. It's smart, funny, sad, and insightful. It was a lot of fun to read."
2,Not a hit at my house,"Halfway into the story, my kids asked if we could read something else. I suspect this may be a book that appeals more to adults than to children. The art work is beautiful and the plot worthwhile, but the narrative voice is so distant and emotionless--I expect that is probably what turned my kids off. The girl, the tribe, and the animals don't have names. The piece reads like a prologue rather than a story."
5,Beautiful art.,"Paul Goble transcends perfection. Any artist, or anyone who loves art, will want to look at this book again and again...Simon & Schuster recommends the book for ages 5 to 8, but any child approaching or in his or her early teens would be enchanted by the simplicity of the artwork and the way it so powerfully conveys the story the words tell. Even adults will enjoy this poetic picture book."
4,My 4 yr. old daughter loves horses,"I buy books for her usually with horses in them because she simply adores these animals. I was hesistant at first with this book, because it's a little much for her to understand, but she loves it; asks alot of why questions but until now we have both been able to answer them. I loved this book as well and feel its very loving towards these animals, that are often neglected. I will probably purchase more books from this very author. Thank you Paul Goble and my daughter loves your book and we read it together time and again."
3,The girl who loved wild horses,The book I read is called The girl who loved wild horses. The girl who loved wild horses is for younger children under 8. It is about a girl that lived with wild horses. In a terrible storm the horses get scared and run away into the wild horse country. Since she does not know the way home how will she survive? I would give this book 3 stars.
3,Book with lot of theory,For me being in the industrial noise control training and consultation this book is better for the people who develop their own research papers and college study than the poeple like me who are looking for applications and models that I can use to solve noise problems.
3,Summer Fun,"In Fat Girls and Lawn Chairs, Cheryl Peck breezily writes about the innocence of childhood, the perks of being the oldest sibling (i.e. tormenting her younger siblings), and loving herself no matter her size or age. This book is a delight. Peck has a charming way with words. She'll make you nostaglic for simpler days and remind you to see the humor in everyday situations. Fat Girls and Lawn Chairs should be on everyone's summer reading list."
2,Boooooooooring,"While this book is not an utter garbage, there's nothing remarkable about it either, at least in my opinion. There's a certain wit and charm to ""Fat Girls..."", but that in itself doesn't save it from being mediocre. Even though miss Peck says that she's not a professional writer, by any means, it still feels as if though you need be a part of her family in order to enjoy this book. There's no humor in here, despite whatever reviews are saying - its just a number of observations on life, good ones at that, but I was looking for something else.Bonus points for an excellent books cover."
4,4.5 stars!,"Peck writes an astonishingly hilarious book! I laughed outloud so many times while reading this book!It is a rare find to read a series of mini-essays, in the form of an autobiography, written by an individual who is so comfortable in their own skin and accepts themselves and their life experiences the way Peck has. She holds nothing back - and is genuine in the process. The author certainly has a delightful sense of humor and the mere reading of her book reminds us that we all need to laugh at ourselves from time to time, especially if we want to be happy in our lives.The style of prose is quite humorous and the imagery very vivid. I intend to have my students read chapters of her book and analyze the writing style - for it is an outstanding model for such a task.Be forewarned, though, not every essay is as intriguing as the others. Regardless, the book is an excellent read."
5,This is a wonderfull read,"This collection contains many very funny stories and a few that are quite moving...The final entry is a poem ""Starbright""..It cannot be read wihout tears...One hopes that Ms. Peck has many more books in her."
3,fit Camry 2005 (Jbl) rear speakers,"I had to reverse the negative and positive wires on the harness for it to match my 2005 Camry. Other than that the harness did fit. Go to Crutchfield.com and get the ""For select 1978-up vehicles"" work great for the 2005 Camry (jbl) system"
1,WRONG WRONG WRONG,well I basically threw my money out the window on this one. these connectors did not fit my 1986 Toyota pickup without wing windows. the connectors are completely different. Ended up just cutting the factory wires and wiring straight to the speakers.
5,Georgie O'Keefe,"This book was a gift so I am speaking only to the quality of the product in that way. Lovely pictures, well-represented by description online. Very pleased"
4,"An Interesting Read, But Short on Pictures","I bought this book partially because of having lived at Ghost Ranch briefly during the time that Georgia O'Keeffe lived and painted there. I love her New Mexico paintings, and had hoped to find many pictures of the incredible landscape which I knew and loved. While the book is very interesting, I find it quite short on plates of (both paintings and photographs of) the Ranch and Abiquiu, and some of her favourite features don't appear at all."
2,Try Another Grip,"CONS - The grip is terrible at absorbing any kind of wetness and becomes extremely slippery. The grips also only last for a 2-3 hour session of hitting which is disappointing. If you like to make thick overlaps when applying the grip you will be unpleasantly surprised when you come to the top and most of the replacement grip is still showing, the pre-cut segments are extremely short.PROS - the price is greatOverall I would advise anyone to try another grip and fork out the extra $."
2,Trick or Treat,"I have to admit I haven't watched this movie since I was a metal hating punk rock teenager, but the soundtrack is awful, and it's just a dumb movie."
4,Black Roses,"I have been trying to find this 80's movie about a nerd turned rocker. This wasn't the movie, but it was okay. It was about a rock band in league with the devil that tries to take the souls of the teenagers in this small town. It wasn't bad for a B movie from the 80's."
2,NOT WHAT IT SEEMS TO BE,"I bought this recently based on the one review here and was thorougly dissapointed. It is filled with blessings and rituals for every type of occasion, however, unless you yourself are a pastor or belong to a church that advocates the practice of rituals - there isn't very much help from this little book. I suppose one can use the material within as inspiration to create one's own personal rituals. But this would require quite some effort. I was looking for a book of instruction that the average person may practice privately at home. If that is what you are also searching for, then, this book is NOT IT! Even if you belong to a congregation you may not be able to use the suggestions in the book if your church does not practice any type of rituals or rituals as described in this book (frankly, I don't know of any church that does)."
5,Cowboys of the old west,Getting this for an adult who likes to color. A high quality color book for the price.It is a great deal!
1,Wanted to Like It!,"After reading the mixed reviews I hoped the negative ones were due to improper application so I ordered it hoping for the best. I thoroughly cleaned my hardwood floor and vacuumed top and bottom of a 10 foot long runner carpet for my hallway. I attached the backing tape per instructions running it around the entire perimeter and down the middle of the carpet using the entire roll for just one small carpet. It seemed to work well for a whopping two days!!! Now, all you need to do is bump the edge rather than stepping on top of the rug and the rug will move an inch or two. It doesn't slide like it used to but it by no means stays in place. I cleaned the floor again and made sure there was no accumulation of dust on the tape surface but it still moves.The search continues!"
1,doesn't hold a thing,I bought this product to hold an area rug on hardwood floors (as the description indicated it would) and within 24 hours the area rug was slipping all over the place. I ended up putting the whole pack of tape on this little 2x3 rug but it still didn't hold. Big waste of money.
4,prevents chair & table slippage on wood floor,I used this product to put on the bottom of my toddler's table and chairs. Her table is on a wood floor and it slides around some. This tape added some grip and mostly eliminated that problem. I do have to replace the tape from time to time because my daughter moves around a lot and eventually the tape comes off but this doesn't happen often.
2,HOLD-IT..NOT!!!!,"Not happy with this product at all, I ordered it because I have 2 dogs and a cat that love to play together, well my rugs end up 20 feet from their original spot all the time, I read another review where the lady says the product works great, she had a large dog and the rug never moves since she uses this product, well my animals are little guys, maybe 5 pounds each! and the rugs are still sliding all over the place...DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!! this is a bad product...it might work if the rugs are on top of carpet but not bare floors!"
1,What is pictured is not what I got,"The picture shows tape you can put around the edges of the rug, but what I actually received is a 10 by 20 inch mat that goes underneath the entirety of the rug. I trusted the picture and should have read the description more closely. I probably should have sent it back, but it would've been more trouble and expense than it was worth. I ended up buying the right product at Lowe's."
1,followed instructions,"and my rug is still sliding all over my bedroom. With a hardwood floor, my puppy can't get traction to jump on the bed, so even using this product I'm woke up to put him back on the bed. Can't return it after you use it, real dissapointed."
1,Does not stick!,"The packaging clearly states ""Safe for all types of hard flooring surfaces including vinyl, tile, hardwood and laminate"" and I'm telling you that statement is false. I followed the directions to a T and my bathroom rugs kept shifting and did not stick to the floor as indicated."
1,Doesn't Work,I used the whole on a small rug and the tape broke down after 3 days. This is a big waste of my money...
5,It worked,"I bought 12 pieces 8""x19"" stair treads carpet with traction non slip backing for my hardwood stair, but all pieces keep moving when people walking up and down the stair. Looking around to find solution and give this product a try to see what happen. I was in doubt when applying this product to the back of each piece since the non-adhesive side of the tape wasn't stayed in place to the rugs as you've seen on the product image. However, after few weeks running up and down the stair, all carpet pieces haven't not moved an inch. Great product to solve the problem."
2,Does not Hold!,Two way tape holds stair pads much better! this product does not hold stair mats when applied end to end accross top middle and bottom! used immediately does not hold after firdt day on clean and dry surface and double tape does!
1,Barely sticky,There's not much stick to this tape. It doesn't hold the carpet down. Saying 7 more words doesn't make much sense.
3,"have to use a lot, looses stickiness","Bought this to hold some area rugs in place on my wood floors. Had to use practically the whole thing just to hold down one 2x6 runner. You can't just put down one strip at each end. The weight of the rug is not enough to prevent slipping - my dogs can even move the rug. It only prevents movement if you happen to be stepping exactly where the tape is. Hoped this would be a safe solution - it's safe, but not a solution. And after three months, whatever anti-slip grippiness is gone anyway."
2,Okay,"DId not indicate this was a childrens book. I will read it in any case, but should have been noted."
3,Slippery when wet,"I like the feel of this when it's a mellow rally but when my hands get a little sweaty, my grip slips.What I have done is use this UNDER a TournaGrip and things are great. BTW, TournaGrip should only sell XL because even the XL is not that long and it has to be cut.TournaGrip needs to get the length and shape from Gamma. Or Gamma needs to make a grip that does not slip as much.Time to get outside and play!"
1,Great photos - terrible quality camera,"Because of its location and design, the on/off dial will turn when inserting camera into case or pocket - resulting in camera remaining powered with lens extended.Poor design of memory-card door allows it to spring open during use if you touch the release button.First camera I got became hot to the touch when used. I called Minolta and was told that I need to send it to them (and pay shipping) and they will check and decide what to do (even though the technician seemed familiar with the problem). Called Dell instead and they immediately sent me a replacement (great support). Unfortuanately, the new camera had all the same problems, except for the heat. I am sending both back."
3,Good price for a 4mp but some drawbacks,"Positives:1. It is 4MP and only $350- So a great price for a 4MP digital camera!2. Great quailty picturesNegatives:1. The on/off dial easily turns to 'on' when you put it in a camera bag, which means that when you need it most you take it out to find out the batteries are dead!2. You need to buy good quality rechargable batteries like the monster powerpack because this drains normal batteries only after several photos.3. The place on the camera where you put the batteries is often difficult to shut properly.Overall it is a good digital camera for the price but because the drawbacks really got to me I returned it."
4,Delivers as promised,"Its an excellent camera for the price in its range. Lots of positives, however let me list out some few negatives that I can think of :* Battery compartment is little difficult to close (with batteries inside it) and looks a little fragile.* It gets hot around battery region after around 6-7 shots.* In automode outputs noisy image for night landscape (probably because it switches automatically to ISO 400)..However changing to ISO 100 rectifies this.* Drains away the battery quite quickly.* A little on heavier side.* Once in a while it just hangs and needs to be resetted."
4,good picts but drains batteries like crazy,excellent pictures but uses up batteries like crazy.Nimh batteries a must.Odd size difficult to find suitable case. Otherwise I love it!
5,Very nice camera,I have 3 digital cameras and this is the last one I purchased.I really like this camera. It does use alot of batteries butall of them do. Just buy a charger. It takes excellentpictures.
5,Reliable - does it all,"This camera has the speed needed in snapping off multiple photos without stopping. The reset speed is remarkably faster than I had expected. This camera does just about everything I ever wanted to do using a digital camera. I enter photo contests, and get great results. The Optical zoom is more than the average 3X Optical. It seems to do anything other cameras do, only with that little added touch. Can't beat the price, and appears to withstand punishment; no bumps or bruises."
2,minolta dimage S414 Digital camera,"Bought a Minolta Dimage S414 digital camera,took about 2 weeks to understand all the features of the camera. Then all I could get on the camera display was Err message. Installed new batterys,memory card and still did not work. Called Minolta and they had me send it back to be repaired. Still waiting for camera.Think twice before buying one."
2,"Wonderful photo quality, awful power design","This camera takes beautiful photos. The wide lense gives a nice straight picture.However...A set of AA alkalines lasts for only 5-10 flash photos.Using expensive lithium batteries allows the camera to consume all it wants and thus overheats to the point that touching the memory card burns you. Laughably, the manual warns against touching the hot memory card after long continuous use!The battery door is plastic and becomes chewed up by the metal case. Also, the zoom is easily damaged by switching on the camera accidentally when it's in a bag.I bought the Canon S50. It was a couple hundred dollars more and photo quality is a tad poorer than the S414, but it has a rechargeable battery which lasts for a whole day of photos and the memory card hardly even gets warm."
3,Ok camera for the price,"Pay 199, new. cheapest 4MB and 4x optical I found, so what you get.I own a Olympus D-380 too (for 2 years). Focus free and 2 MB. Sometimes I prefer the 380, it doesn't eat so fast the batteries.(but 380 gets sometimes wear little white rounds spots with pictures taken with flash at night, sometime too many).The Minolta is clean in that way. Heavy camera, good features at menus.Pictures with flash are fine at night. Pictures at day too blue, not good auto white. Sometimes better do it manual.CONS:- eats a lot of baterry- color quality is not I aspect. much better is Olympus. Color quality is similar to HP products (2002-03) kind of dark.- most of cons of previews reviewers are true.PROS-Price and 4x optical"
4,GOOD CAMERA COMPARED TO OTHERS...,"GOOD CAMERA COMPARED TO OTHERS ON THE MARKET AT THE TIME I BOUGHT IT. TAKES GREAT PIC'S, MY SISTER BOUGHT THE HP AND MINE TAKES BETTER QUALITY PICTURES. ALTHOUGH MY NEXT CAMERA WILL BE ALOT SMALLER. I LOVE THIS ONE!"
2,Great Price...Average Camera,I had previously used a Canon s30 and I figured that it was time to grab a new camera with a little higher resolution before my (expensive) Compactflash collection becomes obsolete. But after taking a few shots in auto and comparing them to the Canon pics I immediatley noticed how grainy and yellow the pictures looked. Messed around with manual controls and I was able to remedy the yellow hue problem but the pictures remained grainy with a soft focus. Returned after a few days of messing with settings.Pros:-price-features-4x optical zoomCons:-camera is gigantic-poor image processing-overly soft focus
1,BATTERY HOG AND MORE,"Unless you own a rechargeable battery factory, you must have a supply of freshly-charged batteries on hand to use this camera. If you charged the batteries last week, have not used them, the charge may have decayed enough for the camera to not work. I have tried several brands of premium batteries with the same results. Many times I have switched the camera ON only to receive the ""low battery"" warning and watch the camera switch itself OFF. As a result, I have missed several photo opportunities.In addition, the display is slow to respond if the camera is moved to better frame a subject."
3,Minolta S414,This is a great little camera if you can tolerate regular battery changing. Takes great pictures and fits nicely in a small bag. I suggest to all interested in getting good rechargeable batteries and a car charger if taken on trips. I have now bought 5 of these cameras. Guess you might say I am a camera freak. I like the macro ability and the clean images even at 4 meg. I also have a wall charger for use at home. This is the camera I use at work to document parts. Tripod mount is not in a good location but can be overcome using a flash bar attachment. Careful when putting away - comes on easily because of power-on dial. Software that comes with it can be loaded on newer (Windows 7)computers (Dimage Viewer).
4,Karaoke,"I ordered the IVL Handheld Karaoke Player and am very satisfied with it. We have had so much family fun with it which is what I had hoped for. It's easy to use, the songs are great and most of all it is something our family and friends can do together."
5,The Best of African Songs by Safari Sound Band--GREAT album,"This music is so fun and enlightening and will make you feel like you are on Safari just listening to it. The lyrics are mostly in Swahili and are good ways to learn a few words of this lovely language. I especially liked ""Jambo Jambo"" which is sung on birthday celebrations in Kenya but there wasn't one of the 14 tracks which we didn't like. Kids love it too!"
3,"Jambo, Jambo","This is an album of well known, commercialized Kenyan songs. The song entitled ""Jambo Jambo"" on this album and mentioned in the review above is NOT a Kenyan birthday song. It is basically a tourism song - it welcomes visitors to the country of Kenya. The first few lines translate roughly to: ""Hello, Hello Sir. How are you? Very well. Visitors, you are welcome to our Kenya. There are no worries."" Just thought I'd share this information for those people who are interested in knowing the correct meanings/contexts of the songs."
3,iMAC owners be wary !,"I bought a Dymo330. As an owner of an iMACDV, I use a USB Hub. This printer, I learn quickly, cannot be plugged into the Hub and be recognized by the computer. The printer will not print when requested to do it.I bought two new, different brands of hubs, at other's direction. All failed. Foolish me.When I direct connect the printer to my Computer's USB port, it works. Then I remove it, insert it back into the Hub, and insert the hub's connector back into the computer. The printer continues to accept print commands and will printlabels! But there remains a surprise.The iMACDV will not reboot. Only by removing the printer from the hub will booting be restored. Just ducky.After all of this, how could I ever consider buying one of these?"
1,DYMO demands registering,"The printer is ok. The software demands registering, reminds you forever.The register process demands a great deal of data [I gave them all nonsense but I had to go through the process]. You cannot contact DYMO to complain except by telephone. This sort of thing makes me furious. I won't buy anything else from them."
1,Skip this printer if you have a Mac,"Unfortunately, this new 330 is a major step in the wrong direction. As far as the database software goes, this is a disaster. The old interface and conventions were intuitive and easy to update. This new interface was cobbled together by someone that doesn't have the slightest programming knowledge or basic common sense. They actually used apple keyboard commands, which are reserved for apple functions, as shortcuts! It is virtually impossible to use. You can't even have custom names for more than one person at a single address - like ABC Co.-Joe, ABC Co.-Jane, etc. The software can only take its database listing from the first line of the address, period. Even then, you only get like 12 characters. All in all, this is a bush league offering.It's sad when companies can't leave well enough alone and have to tamper with a successful product."
3,Won't work with XP64,"I used to love this little printer... but once I upgraded to XP64, it became completely useless. I can't believe they haven't updated the software yet."
3,"Works, but the COST....","This little machine is one of only a couple dedicated label printers. I have no experience with the others. No consumables - when it stops printing it is done. However, it is supposed to last a very very long time. At work we are using it to generate library book labels. I feel that it is highly overpriced when you consider the regular printers you could get for this price!! And it is only a mini-printer, so the cost is just that there is no real competition. As to setup and software installation - great - no trouble. I had another DYMO that died after only about half of what the life was supposed to be. So although it is little and cute and works well, think about the actual NEED. if you need one - then you have to get a DYMO."
1,It did not work,"I could not get this label printer installed in my windows xp computer. I called the support line twice. I may be the unlucky one, but the individuals I got, were no help at all.I sent it back."
2,"Great, but short-lived","I've owned two of these, both of which have failed within a year and a half (first one the print head died, second one the internal power supply died). I used it almost daily, but certainly within the scope of what they consider ""normal usage"". Nice product concept, but cheaply built and very badly quality controlled (it gets VERY hot when running, which is probably the design flaw that has lead to both failures). Definitely a sub-standard product for the price."
2,DYMO label smears problem being ignored,"I was a great fan of my Dymo until I realized that many of the labels smear because of the heat when being processed at the Post Office. If you put the label where you would usually put the address of someone you are mailing, the label will smear badly and become unreadable. I've brought the problem up to Dymo several times but have never received an adequate explanation of what they are doing to solve the problem. This is a serious problem since there is a chance many letters may not be getting through. I now use my Dymo only for labeling files and return addresses... I wondered why I did not get responses from people I sent letters to.. apparently the never got them... Send a few test envelopes to yourself to see the extent of the problem..."
5,Wonderful book,"I bought this book for my boyfriend (and myself) after spending a good half hour of looking at it in the store. It's a wonderful book with endless pages of striking images. I take this book out often to read, I get something new from it every time."
2,TOO NARROW!,"You have to have very narrow feet for this shoe to fit. I do not have wide feet, and there is no way I would do these shoes. Sooo sad... have to go back."
3,cute,"This cute little bowl arrived in a rather large box. It was wrapped and padded very well, and now I know why. The first time I washed it the bowl chipped. So it's a really cute bowl that looks just like the picture, but it chips pretty easily."
5,"Perfect, lots of storage!","I read reviews up and down before purchasing this one and couldn't be happier. Tons of storage, all shapes and sizes fit and do not fall out, unless of course you unscrew it which I did to paint and realized there is nothing on the back of the rack to hold it from falling. That was a fun clean up! All and all great product and well represted."
1,I thought hate was bad.....,Well for being a hatemonger on the right of center I've noted the left hating alot. Where is the love? This book is just another example of the left being upset with the right also having freedom of speech. I have to fear this nazi like anger with people who dare to disagree with the left wing crazies who have hyjacked the demoratic party. They no longer use reason just call names to shut down the debate. There starting to scare with how extreme they've become. So be good little leftest and believe every word vomited forth from the DNC and pundits like this hate monger.
1,"There isn't an ""I hate bill clinton, dan rather book""","Just a comment on the civility of the right compared to the hatred spewed on the left. It is interesting to note that you cannot find a book with the words ""I hate..."" and Bill Clinton, Dan Rather, George Stephanopolous, James Carville, etc. Perhaps the respect for a differing view only applies to one side. Perhaps liberals prefer to love someone like Clinton; an accused rapist and serial abuser of women; while saying that they hate people of principle like President Bush. Disagree with him all you want, get your people elected to cause change, vote - but avoid hatred because it is stupid and dangerous. Civility and respect - look it up liberals."
1,Hate is NEVER good,This book was nothing more then a Ultra Liberal who hates those that doesn't share his views. This country is going to hell fast and both sides are to blame.But I believe that liberals want to give our freedoms away and take what they don't earn.After reading this book I moved ever farther to the right because at least we let you speak your view point without telling you that you don't have the right to have your opinion.Don't waste your time on this book.. just hate speak and super liberal nonsense
1,A Perfect Title,"At least the title of the book is accurate:""I Hate"" is indeed at the very core of radical, destructive, hate-mongering, defeatist, self-loathing Left-wing lunacy.For true intolerance, look to the Left, not the Right."
2,A Liberal Reader for those who dislike the pompous pundits of right wing land!,"I do not hate Ann Coulter but I do dislike her! In this anthology of articles on the likes of Ms. Coulter; Rush Limbaugh;Bill O'Reilly; Sean Hannity; Michael Savage and thestars of Fox TV, Regency Books and George Wills we see the darkside of these neo-conservative media darlings.The book contains several articles that are years old. Thebook is thin on biographical information on the persons who arechronicled and is written by several liberal critics of theradio/TV wars in the age of George W. Bush.I did learn some facts on these folks I did not know but wassomewhat disappointed in this poorly printed on cheap paperpaperback."
