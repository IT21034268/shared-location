3,Okay quality,"The sides of the wholes are not very smooth. So if you have any silk or wool scarf, I would not recommend you to use it. Shipping was very fast."
5,Amazing,Music of Gustav HolstGustav Holst is one of my all time favorite artists and this collection most definitely reproves that fact. Sound quality of music is fantastic. All music is even better. There are some well known classics on this CD as well. Absolutely recommend. Only down-fall? No title and artist information on CD. You must manually put it in. Not even a Windows Media Player CD info search has any info on the CD (as of 4/24/08).
2,Title should be: A Child's Guide to Skydiving,"I was hoping for something a bit more substantial. This book is very short and very basic and does not really give you much in the way of useful info. For what you get, the book is very overpriced. If you only want to know what skydiving is then this book will tell you, otherwise I cannot recommend buying this book."
3,Pretty book,I purchased this for my child's school auction to go with a picnic basket. Attractive book and well worth the price paid.
1,For A Picnic In The Hamptons...Maybe...,"I bought DeeDee's book mainly because of the price. I thought an inexpensive book on picnics: some good recipes and tips - forget it.On my first inspection only one or two recipes interested me. Well, maybe I just wasn't hungry. I put the book away and tried again later. Nope, nothing here.Most of the recipes, if not all, are for the wine and brie set picnicing in the Hamptons. If your picnic ideas include hummus with creamed cucumber dressing, garnished with figs that are stuffed with walnut and endive, this book is for you, otherwise look elsewhere.I really think this book was put through a marketing survey and they felt they could only get the ten dollars for it if they were lucky."
3,"Not like the debut, but ......","..... excellent, nonetheless! These guys are SUPERIOR musicians and know their instruments from back to front. This release is not as (dare I say it?) ""Yes-like"" as their debut or even their second release, ""Fountains Of Light."" It's a damned good companion piece to those two albums though, so I highly recommend getting this one! If you dig good prog, you won't be disappointed ... Trust me!"
3,A good album which is their 1st attempt to turn to AOR ...,"This is their first attempt to turn their style to AOR music, which will be their ""sad"" achievement in the next ""Real to reel""-in comparison to their previous albums, expecially the 1st and the 2nd one ...and partially the present one as well: however this latter is still good despite of the mellow quite banal songs within, such as ""Could be this love"" and ""Can't think twice"", or ""Shadows of song"", ""Shine on Brightly"" and ""White wings"", which are in a mellow pomp rock vein... instead ""Evening wind"" is an ispiring derivative track in the vein of Yes and also ELP oriented; while ""Why have they gone"" is oriented to their early style and remarkable too, like a sort of a backward step to their past!Still good but not essential (the cover artwork for the cover is much better!!)"
2,very bad timing,"I agree with the other reviewer, their timing was most definitely horrible. They were a common opening act in the midwest and, b/c they always were paired up with harder rock acts, they were always underappreciated or booed off the stage.They were fine musicians, wrote decent songs and were a very capable live act. ""Shine on Brightly"" is a good, hippy, prog song. While they were good musicians, their songs did lack the drama of Yes, Genesis or Kansas. I actually enjoyed their ""Reel to Real"" album.This is a quality album but it's really only for the devoted fan. If you remembered them from the 70's, was wondering if you can get Starcastle on cd, and are elated to hear this obscure music once again, then this is for you. Otherwise, no teenager will like this. I don't know if I like this b/c its truly good or it is just nostalgic for me.*If you are a guitar player, the guitarist does interesting things imitating keyboards with his guitar"
2,The last gasp?,"Citadel - Starcastle's third album - displays the natural progression of a derivative ""prog-oriented"" band. I.E.: no surprises. Musically, it's (slightly) a bit more varied than their previous effort (Fountains Of Light ~ their best album ~ which is essentially one 36 minute long piece). However ... Terry Luttrell's vocals sound like Jon Anderson, after being slammed with a stun gun. Citadel is for die-hard proggies ... and fans of watching a band go down in a swirling pool of mediocre imitation. Sad, really -"
3,Starcastle continues the Magic,"Starcastles 3rd album continues the path they previously set of a YES sound-alike. While not as good as the first album, it clearly is a must for a Starcastle fan."
3,one family's one year road trip journal,This family goes on a homeschooling road trip and this is there journal. It was pretty cool to hear about the things that they did and the bond they had as a family. They decide to put there kids back in public school after the year is up.
2,Poor quality,"Product looks good on the Web But when it arrived it looks like they gave me the oldest one ,Housing of poor quality,6 cd's at top and bottom of case total scatched. Would not recommend to any body."
2,These DVDs have some issues...,"I bought these not thinking that the quality of the DVD-R mattered. Turns out, it kind of does. It was difficult to get these DVDs to play in my DVD player or even on my girlfriend's laptop. Sometimes they would work, but most of the time they didn't play at all."
5,"The song ""You Will""","The very first time that I heard the song entitled, ""You Will"", I cried. The song hit my heart so hot and heavy because it made since. Through life's experiences, an individual will fall and attempt to get back up only to be knocked down again. People will not understand your way of thinking. People will, constantly, point fingers at you; but, never look at themselves. This song is an uplifting song for the individual that has been emotionally drained. It is also a song for someone that has lost a loved one or a child has left home and there is an empty-next syndrome. Overall - this is a wonderful and uplifting CD; but, my favorsite song is ""You Will""."
5,Awesome!,Cece Winans is definitely an anointed vessel used by God. It is evident that she has a very real relationship with the Holy Ghost. This album is truly a blessing and I would highly recommend it. It is a project where God is truly exalted.
4,IT'S A MUST,"Cece has done it again with this excellent abulm. It is truly a cd that has something for everyone. Im 19 years old and im still into the fast type of songs and there was one on there that kept me listening called a ""Place like this"". It has this little part when you hear a voice saying ""It's where I wanna be, I wanna be"". Oh yea and that just stuck in my head. Pray is also a good song that I jam to sometimes and all that I need. I would recommend this to everyone who loves gospel."
2,Not her Best,I was not impressed with this project. The CD's after Alabaster Box have been a disappointment. I normally enjoy her work but this just didn't move me at all.
2,Disappointed,CeCe is disappointing with this effort. The album lacks depth. The songs are uncustomarily shallow. Nothing at all will jump out at you on this CD.
1,This Is Her Worse CD,"They just threw this together... It is NOT a good CD, you may as well just download the 2 songs (Pray & Always Sisters) Not worth your money. Very disappointing!!! SHe needs to get back working with her husband...better cd's were done when he was the manager. She has become VERY worldy...She let me down... as usual.."
4,You Can't Fail With CeCe.,"For a true Christian Spirit that glows through Ms. Winans, you'll always find her music sung straight from the heart. A Precious Pearl in the Gospel community, ""Purified"" continues in the CeCe tradition, of lifting our souls to a higher plain."
5,ANNOINTED!,"This release from CeCe Winans is a true instant classic! Her vocals are so strong and the material on this album is so versatile! She incorporates R&B, Christian, & Gospel Music all into one album! But most of all it lifts the spirit of our Lord and Savior! I love this album and it should be in the collection of die hard music fans!"
5,"Hugs to you too, Gale!","The Baby's Cross is a true story of courage, faith and perseverance despite all obstacles. I cannot imagine going through isolation, countless operations, pain and enormous losses of friends and loved ones at such a young age and coming through it all with such determination! Gale Perkins truly does have the 'heart of a clown' and an inner thread of courage that helped her survive. Love and faith prevented her spirit from being broken. There is also a great lesson in here on the importance of forgiveness. This really is a ten star book, and then some!Chrissy K. McVayauthor of 'Souls of the North Wind'"
4,Memories Revived,"I, spent 5 months in the Lakeville Sanatorium in 1953 in the polio ward. I found Gale's book well written and really admired her. Received it on a Sat. afternoon and finished it Sun. Could not lay it down. Brought back a lot of memories."
1,Disappointment,I purchased the Pyramid NS10 10 amp NS to remove some if not all of the RFI I had in my HF mobile radio and it simply did not work at all. Installation was per the directions and the end result was slightly MORE NOISE!!I would not recommend this item to any radio operator if asked.
1,"Arrived busted, took it apart. Found...","It arrived with no continuity between the two hot leads. Took the unit apart.Discovered one inductor and two capacitors, no printed circuit board, just an extremely poor hand soldering job. Not even sure they used rosin-core solder. They also used very thin wires.I reworked the unit to get it to ""work"" as intented. It is a basic passive low pass filter circuit with the inductor in series with the supply and one capacitor to ground on each side of the inductor.The inductor was small. 10 Amps? No way."
1,Expecting a new product...,Ordered expecting to be sent a new product. Product was obviously used. The base was completely dirty/covered in tape and other stickiness. Missing parts. Severely disappointed to be sent a used items.
2,Sunbeam 24-Piece 'NEW' Kitchen Carousel Set,"Looked as though it has already been in someone's kitchen who was getting a lot of ""USE"" out of it. Stained, dirty and was not as described when they said 'NEW'. I was quite disappointed."
2,D,"Supposedly this was supposed to be about a murder. I never got that far into the movie. From the part I watched, it was just about the day in the life of a lesbian. I expected more from McGillis/"
4,"A daring foray into the unknown, an alive story","Jean Ure has successfully created a sense of loneliness, morbidness and a pervasive feeling of helplessness in this novel about a girl Fran who goes off to a survival camp for a month and finds everything wracked by this plague she doesn't know much about. Her friend Harriet - went bonkers. She gets to know Shahid, who was with her throughout the most torturous days of the plague. This is a perfect book for the exploration of the innate psychology of youngsters when they are under pressure. It also gives an insight into the lives of British kids under a 'pop-diesel' culture. A book worth reading, especially when you feel that you have nothing to read. This book has the ability to give you a creepy feeling, because it is so sci-fi and is mainly a foray into a genre yet unsaturated."
1,Let me in on the point of this book--if there is one.,"I had to read this book for a school competition. Not only was it boring and unrealistic, it also had no point. The ending was horrible-- if you could consider that an ending, and the characters were underdeveloped. There is no central idea to this book, and the ideas do not progress logically. This book reads like a diary (A few chapters actually are a diary), and there is rarely any action or meaningful events. The ending leaves the reader wanting more-- like an ending! Though I did not enjoy this book (And I don't think you would either) I gave it one star for effort. It probably was hard for Jean Ure to fill 180 pages with garbage, without passing out from the fumes of bad writing. Overall, when I finished this book, the main thought on my mind was, ""Why did I finish this book?!"""
1,Ble,You people looking for a good book? Ha not here. This book was cheesily written. A steroid induced monkey could write better Jibberish. Get real Jean!
5,Perfect,"I have tried this in two vehicles with a Garmin Streetpilot i5. It works perfectly, does not move around, even during emergency braking."
5,Garmin GPS Friction Mounting Kit,"Works fine, lasts a long time. Unit does not move around at all on the dash. Holds Garmin GPS snugly. Just be careful when ordering on line, they are made different for different models of the GPS (350, etc.)"
5,must have for portable gps,"This is a wonderful mounting kit, I have a i3 and it saves me a lot of trouble. The only issue is that I wish any gps could be mounted on this base instead of just garmin i series."
4,Garmin Friction Mounting Kit,"This product works exactly as described. No slippage even in the hardest of turns. It allows the gps unit to be swiveled for driver or passenger viewing, and is easily removeable...no stickum. It's a little on the pricey side as is everything else related to GPS but it does the job."
5,Tom the Beach Man,This item was needed for use with the Garmin i5 GPS unit. Fits well on the dashboard on my 06 Civic. In California it is illegal to suck the GPS to the windshield.
3,Short lifespan,For about 2 years it worked fine on our dashboards - Rav4 and Mazda 3. But now it does not stay in place. It tumbles down every time I accelerate. Thinking of buying new cars now ...
4,Works as described,I've been using this for about a week now and it's sitting on my dash and not moving. This is a big improvement over having the suction cup stop working and the i5 (Garmin) falling to the dash OR the sun melting the suction cup while it's on the windshield.
4,Does the trick,This thing is most certainly the best way to have multi-vehicle usage with the i3 - at least that I've found. It's going to move in evasive manuevers but then most things that aren't fastened or stuck on will. It's nice to be able to re-position it and find that perfect place in nearly any vehicle. I recommend this mounting kit very highly if you have to use it in more than one place. It beats the heck out of suction cups - that's for sure.
5,It Works,This thing really does stay put on my dashboard. Beats trying to affix my StreetPilot on the windshield (it would never stay put).
4,Better than the suction cup,"The suction cup which attached to the window worked fine for about a year, then it failed repeatedly causing the GPS unit to thud onto the dashboard while driving. This unit solves the problem, and works reasonably well. I deduct one star because I find that over sharp speed bumps the unit slides down the dashboard (though I'm driving a large SUV, not a smooth as silk luxury car). A velcro attachment to the dashboard would likely fix this.Overall a good buy."
4,Worth the money,"After using my i3 for about 8 months, I think GPS is very essential. This device is great except: If you turn it off somewhere and turn it on somewhere else, it sometimes takes quite some time (15-20 min.) for it to figure out the location. Can be pretty annoying depending on the situation. I'd certainly recommend it, though."
1,NOT GOOD,This was the wrong item shipped to me originally. I wanted the typec mount which would be much easier to use than this one.my friend ordered the same 2 units and received the type c mount. I was very dsisapointed with the unit I received andI shipped it back and never received another one.
2,Great - Until it's time to remove it,"I've really liked this product. Provides a great texture for your palms and generally does the job of keeping stains away from the Mac itself.But - when going to remove it after about six months - don't believe the ""comes off clean"" claims. After carefully removing it I was left with some sort of adhesive substance that looks like it will require a neutron torch to remove. So now I get to play with solvents on my Mac - not looking forward to this."
1,WHAT a DISAPPOINTMENT and WASTE of MONEY!,"- This collection comprises of 4 color movies and 5 black-and-white ones.- There's no video re-mastering. Consequently, all the color films are grainy, and so blurry that it's very hard for me to stay focused.- The black-and-white ones are sharper but they are not interesting. ""Go For Broke"" has some funny dialogues but the fighting scenes are bad jokes. Altogether, they consists of about six or seven soldiers on both sides. They clearly show the limited budget.In short, these DVDs are a HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT and WASTE of MONEY."
4,One of Leonard's darker novels.,"Of the half-dozen Leonard novels I've read, 'Split Images' is the darkest, and the best (surprisingly, you don't hear much about this one, all the praise being reserved for the likes of 'Get Shorty' and 'Rum Punch'). As is typical with Leonard's work, the bad guy, and the henchman of the bad guy, are the best characters, the hero always being cut from the same cloth, however cool that cloth might be. Robbie Daniels is a flat-out sociopath who, bored with running the business he inherited from his father, wants to become a freelance hitman. He enlists the help of trigger-happy Homicide cop Walter Kouza, and the results are bloody (and frequently hilarious). Only a Homicide lieutenant and his journalist girlfriend stand in the way. 'Split Images' has genuine suspense, a surprising conclusion, and enough savvy talk and jokes to keep even the hardest-to-please reader entertained."
5,Tragic Police Procedures,"Detective Bryan Hurd finally finds his true love in Elmore Leonard's SPLIT IMAGES. He's a hard-working homicide detective on a vacation from all the various ways people can kill each other in Detroit City. And, believe or not, he falls in love at first sight with the beautiful and talented writer, Angela Nolan. Problem is, the detective can't escape his Detroit roots even while he's in Florida.We can almost see a tragedy coming his way as he hunts down the two Detroit killers, one a dashing movie star type, the other a jaded, disillusioned cop from the Polish neighborhood of Hamtramck, smack dab in the middle of rust-belt Detroit. These boys play rough and murder has become their game.These characters are all strongly back-storied, so we feel we know them well. And when the murders occur, we wouldn't blame Detective Hurd at all for taking his full revenge.by Larry Rochelle, author of the Kansas City thrillers: BLUE ICE, CRACKED CRYSTALS and DEATH AND DEVOTION."
3,Excitement At The End,"Robbie Daniels, a wealthy businessman who has homes in Detroit and Palm Beach. He has an impressive gun collection that he enjoys using to eliminate bad guys. Walter Kouza is an experienced,quick acting detective from Detroit who has moved to Florida. Daniels hires him an a body guard and driver. He also has other services in mind. Bryan Hurd, is another key character. A fair,honest detective from Detroit. Angela Nolan is an attractive free lance journalist who is interviewing Mr. Daniels for an article about the rich and famous. Along the way she is attracted to and quickly falls for Hurd. Unfortunately, she is in the wrong place at the wrong time and is murdered. Hurd, as one might imagine, is the hero who solves the case. I found this book a reasonably good read along the way that picked up intensity at the end."
4,good book as always,split images is about a rich white boy who loves guns and feels invincible.he kills people with no remorse and even hires a homicide detective to work for him.a nice quick read if your into crime novels.
5,Worth every penny !!,"This anthology is a keeper if only for one story, Karin Kallmaker's 'The Curve of Her' which has the two beloved characters from her novel 'Touchwood'.The book starts out with the fabulous 'The Butch Across the Hall' by Karin Kallmaker, it is the perfect selection to begin the collection by setting the tone beautifully (and it's really hot!).Some of the terrific authors in the anthology -Barbara JohnsonTherese SzymanskiJulia WattsPeggy J. HerringLaura Dehart YoungAmie EvansJean StewartMJ WilliamzLeslea NewmanOther stories that left a lasting impression were from L. Elise Bland, Elizabeth Dunn and Joy Parks.A stand out story 'Escapade' from Carol Rosenfeld was simply awesome - I highly recommend it - very emotional."
2,Outdated,"I was expecting more from this book, especially after reading the reviews. I found it to be outdated and not all that useful. There is a lot available for free on the Internet in the way of forms and such that are easier to use than the reproducibles in this book. If you are looking primarily for the ""ready-to-use"" aspect of it, I don't think this book is helpful anymore. It needs to be updated."
2,not worth the price,"i bought this for my 2 year old son. the sounds are tinny and overly loud. and it's confusing to use for any child under age 3. he only played with it for about 15 minutes, then that was it. so not worth the...price tag in my opinion."
2,Not what I expected,"This is not really a practical toy. My son gets discouraged, because you have to press on the keys really hard and in order to follow the music you have to be rough. It's like playing musical chairs with 5 bullies and a moving floor."
1,Musical Hands mat,This toy does not work. I do not recommend it. There is no quality to the workmanship. A total disappointment
1,No Good,"I bought this for my daughters birthday and when we got it, it was a piece of junk the buttons worked for one day then the next day when you tried to push a cerain button it would give you a different noise or it would not work at all, the things are hard to push you have to really push hard on them, this toy is not worth it not even the amount they are asking for to be honest I think it is worth fifty cents, I am very disapointed in it."
1,Crawling it off,"It has numerous sound feature. The music tune it fairly entertaining. However, the touch sensor aren't that sensitive. You have to press it numerous times to make it work. It didn't entertain my child at all."
1,I do not recommend this to anyone,"The sound quality is bad. It's supposed to have piano and bell sounds and also voices of cat, duck, and dog, but those sounds and voices are simply annoying. I mean, they don't sound like what they are supposed to sound. The cat voice is the worst--it sounds like you are braking glass window or something. My son likes to step on the keys, so we decided to keep this toy, but we put some tape (packing tape) on the speaker so that it won't be too loud. Actually, I think there is no volume control."
5,Glass Artwork,Beautiful and heavy piece of glass art. The colors are rich and deep. Love it sitting in the middle of my diningroom table or on an end table.
4,Wiseguy,Great book. Great detail.A must for anyone who has seen the film. Gives you a 100% more info and detail.
4,"Clever, if a bit odd...","As others have said, this book IS a bit off the wall, but it is also clever. My kids (4 and 6) enjoyed looking for what was coming up next in the illustrations. Not your typical bedtime book, but not scary or disturbing for my kids by any means. In fact, they caught on to the irony that Wooly ends up thinking about his family members...which, of course, happen to be sheep ;-)If you like this book, check out Kitamura's ""In the Attic"" for another clever/odd book that my kids found to be a bit silly, too."
2,Creepy,"This is a beautiful but creepy book: a lost sheep all alone, terrified by UFOs no less into fleeing into a strange, deserted home, is not my ideal bedtime reading for a sensitive child. The strong colors are beautiful and a nice change from baby-pastel, but they are also ominous and deterring. His utter solitude, in exploring the house (creepy corridor with blood-colored doors), eating, and finally sleeping, is horrifying to a child with imagination, whose most overriding terror is abandonment. I give it points for beauty and originality, none for sensitivity to the needs of its target audience, and cannot recommend it."
4,"""Christina"" performer of the future",The Latin pop icon. should be justified by having a book so well written about her life. This book lets the reader know everyting from a childhood backround to stardom. a must have for any Christina Aguilara fan!
5,Inexpensive,"Great bowl, great price. Be careful and plan out your strategy before taking it off the fire, tends to get HOT for some reason!! Got one I throw in my GHB too!"
5,This Bowl Has Served Me Well For Years...,"I've had this bowl for six years, and I've used it at home as well as hiking/camping. I absolutely love it, and as the years go by and the trips I've taken with it accumulate, I love the bowl even more.A few random points...* The MSR Alpine Bowl is pretty simple; it would be pretty hard to invent a better bowl. The worth of it is that it is made from sturdy stainless steel. I've held this bowl in one hand, and a titanium bowl in the other--the difference is so negligable as to be unimportant. Unless you feel the need to pay more for titanium, sometimes a higher price does not equate to a better product.* I prefer simple dishes when I'm hiking/camping. I like the ease of cooking and eating from the same bowl, and the Alpine Bowl is perfect for that task.* Takes up very little room in my pack.* The price point is great; I've looked but haven't found any other stainless steel bowl that compares to the Alpine Bowl in quality and price."
3,Little surprised at oyster cracker like liver snacks,Little disappointed at first when received and my sheltie sort of went nose up on them and I thought they where soup crackers. But he started liking them and there certainly are enough of them in bag. Think they would be good for dog training where you just need something little for repetitive positive reinforcment. I'm not sure of the taste but he is liking them more and more.
4,non-messy training treat,"My standard poodle pup likes, but doesn't love these training treats. Definitely not a ""high value"" treat, but works nicely for walks. NO odor or messy crumbs that would ruin jacket pockets of the trainer. I would purchase these again."
1,Pup won't eat them,"My puppy is an eating machine, but she doesn't seem to even recognize these treats as food. They're dry little crackers, so perhaps it's the consistency - who knows. I've tried putting them between her food, wetting them down, pretending to eat it myself before giving it to her, etc. Nope. She just stares at them and walks away. I'll try again in a bit - she's still growing so who knows - but so far these were a complete flop."
2,More Dog Treats,"These treats are too small,even for training trates.I can find other training treats that are so small.The size of a lifesaver."
1,High Calorie Treat,"These are about the size of a small rounded lima bean. They have a shocking 3 calories each, twice as many as a lima bean which has about 1 1/2 calories. No, I am not suggesting that you feed your dog lima beans - just making a comparison based on size. I have a Dobie so it would be insulting to offer him just one of these tiny treats. However, because each of these tiny treats has 3 calories I can't give him very many or he would gain too much weight. If you have a teeny tiny dog that would be satisfied with just one of these teeny tiny treats then go for them. If you have a big dog as I do then you can find a much better treat without all the comparable calories."
5,Loved by the entire pack,"I have three boston terriers and one french bulldog, and they love these treats. The small size and low calories make them perfect for rewards. All of my dogs had a slight weight problem, but after switching their rewards to Charlee Bears (a better value as well) they have all lost the extra weight and are very fit. I feed them a high quality dog food and make sure they have the play/exercise time that they need, but the treats I was feeding before switching to Charlee Bears were too high in calories and too large. Their vet is happy, I'm happy, and most of all my dogs are happy. They love their Charlee Bears!"
3,Mixed emotions!,"I have two 5 & 6 years old adopted male dachshunds and purchased this product as a 'stocking stuffer' for Christmas.The 5 years old ate a few morsels but didn't appear to be too enthused. The 6 years old took one whiff and turned up his nose. Didn't even want to try it. Mind you that dog normally will eat anything - he's the proverbial glutton - and his rotund shape shows it. He is grossly overweight and I thought that with the low calorie of these little bits would be a good idea. Well, I guess I was wrong.All Natural Dog Treats - Liver - 16 oz Resealable Bag"
5,I feel good about giving these to my dogs,"These are a hit with my pups, and for the price and 3 calories a piece, they can't be beat! They're great for training in addition to putting them into food puzzle toys to keep them occupied. I also provide a steady supply of these to my youngest pup during nail clipping as he has quite a bit of anxiety and these treats totally take his mind off of the scary clipper at his toes.First ingredient is wheat flour, so if your dog happens to be allergic to wheat these won't work for you. My dogs aren't allergic, nor do these treats give tummy problems, so I'm happy! Ingredient list is short, that's another plus, it's not a long list of artificial this and that.I give my pups both the liver flavor and the cheese/egg flavor to mix things up a bit.**UPDATE** Turns out my younger sheltie has epilepsy, and possible seizure triggers are wheat, corn, and gluten. Can't give him these these Charlee Bear treats anymore. =("
1,charlie bear has changed ?,"My dogs don't like charlie bear treats anymore. Recently since early 2011 the color and smell of these little treats as well as the texture (they are harder) seems changed. Maybe this is why my dogs turn up their noses at them now. Has anyone else experienced this? I wonder sometimes if the liver has been left out? if the product has changed and dogs don't like it anymore I guess we won't buy it anymore, If the company thought success meant they could change the formula. My dogs nose knows! Marika"
3,Good Product,My dog is spoiled. He'll only eat these if there is nothing else. The good thing is that it is made in the USA.
4,Good for training - small and dry,"My dog likes these treats, though he loves almost any food and will even get excited about his dry kibble.That said, these are small and dry so they are easy to eat quickly during training, not salty like hot dogs and can be dropped on the ground for tracking without attracting ants. They don't fill him up or require cutting or breaking up like larger treats. They seem to keep for a long time as well."
2,Great size and abundance but my dogs didn't care for them.,"I liked the amount that came in the bag and they are non-messy treats (they don't stink or make your hands oily) to give your dogs, but both my chihuahua and boxer don't care much for them. Whenever I give them one of these treats they spit it out. I give them another and they do the same thing..finally after about the third or fourth they will start eating them. They do this same thing every time I try and give them the treats."
5,Great healthy dog treat,"I have a 9 month old weimaraner who loves these treats. I have been mixing them with the Zuke's Chicken mini Naturals dog treats, and bacon strip broken into pieces for puppy class to help him stay interested. But the other two smell so strong that they make these a little smelly for class. I take these along on walks for him and to dog parks because they don't smell strong and I can sometimes sneak them to him without other dogs knowing. They also don't make my coats smell as bad. They are also only 3 calories a piece so they are not super unhealthy. So great to know what your feeding your dog. The ingredients are wheat flour, liver (poultry liver preserved naturally with vitamin E), salt (1 tablespoon per 100-pound), garlic powder."
1,"For what it's worth, my dog dislikes them","My dog isn't overly fond of crunchy treats I found, but he especially dislikes these. He'll eat maybe one or two but he literally spit it back out at me. Lol. Personally, I would go for chewier treats, they have like half calorie training treats that work very well."
4,Gimme Some Sugar!,"Sugar Boxx is a good women in prison movie. Well, at least until the last ten or fifteen minutes, which is when it finally becomes a great women in prison movie. This movie is a homage to 70's exploitation and it succeeds with plenty of breasts, foul language, and camp. Sugar Boxx kinda rocks!"
5,Funny and entertaining,"I really enjoyed this very humorous book about a snobbish and overbearing B&B; owner in Tuscany. The book alternates between Belinda's diary entries - her version of what her life is like - and what her life is really like. The difference is really funny.The other characters in the book are great as well - from Belinda's timid daughter Mary, to the resident writer who does more drinking than writing, to the brash American who opens up a rival B&B.; While they may sound stereotypical, the characters are not one-dimentional and they work really well in this story.To add to the enjoyment of the book, Belinda includes some really delicious Italian recipes in her journal as well.If you want a bit of well written fun, you will like this book."
4,A very cute and colourful book.,This is truly a lovely colourful pop up book for all ages; it's a wonderful book to initiate a baby to the pleasures of reading.
5,"excellent content,colour and child-appeal.","This is a very well-planned book. I understand the author has an alphabet book as well, but as yet I have been unable to find it. I have presented this little book as a gift and I keep one in my library as well."
1,second rate video and poor teaching presentation,The animation is terrible and a waste of time because it is too fast and too difficult to follow. - I just wonder what age group they thought they made this for. I have coached from 6 year olds to college students and probably couldn't use this even to train or teach adult coaches. Long video that looks like a bargain at the price but save your money and keep looking. I can't find anything out there worth paying for and 20 minutes for $25 is a real wast particularly if it is no better than this.
1,Not what I thought,Not what I thought I bought. Probably going to send this item back. I guess I need to read the fine print more closely. I'll be sure to do that the next time I buy one of these videos for my kids.
3,could have been better,"I really hate the 360 spin animations, I would prefer more slow motion game footage, or have a live person very slowly show you the moves zoomed in to the foot.Under $10 would make this 4 star, but I paid ~$15 so I give it a generous 3 star."
4,Good overview,"The video is a good overview of all the various kicks. I do think the digital images that show the kicks in slow motion could be done a little better...maybe a tad slower or in increments, but overall a worthwhile video to own."
4,good skill demonstration video,this video was a great video for my son to watch to get an idea of what kinds of skills he'll be able to pick up. not very practical for actually teaching the skill.
5,"Kind of expensive, but worth it","I picked up this western by chance, and found it to be very enjoyable. With interesting characters and a great plotline, this is your classic western that is sure to keep a fan of the genre hooked."
5,The Lawless Land,"Excellent western novel. Better than a L'Amour novel. It has much more action and surprise than most westerns ever get around to. Although it contains some vivid descriptions of some gun play and shootings, the book is very clean reading with regards to language and romance. Yes, there is a hint of romance, but it only touches on the feelings of the key characters in the novel.The action is western all the way! I liked the actual historical aspect of the book, taking place in a part of the west where what is depicted in this novel actually took place."
5,"Harrington keeps things simple, but no simpler ...","This is a classic graduate textbook for Advanced Electromagnetics courses. One of the main things that I liked the most about this book is Dr. Harrington's strict adherence to one of Dr. Einstein's principles: ""make things simple, but no simpler"" - which works perfect for a graduate-level textbook. I am not implying that this book is difficult to follow than other commonly used graduate texts (""Advanced Engineering Electromagnetics"" by Balanis comes to mind). In fact, this book is much easier to read and follow than books that tend to derive everything for you (which simply ends up cluttering your thought process with too much detail instead of focussing on the main concept in question). Read the chapter on ""Cylindrical Waves"" and compare it with its equivalent in Balanis's book, and you will understand my point. This book is quintessential for graduate students contemplating a career in Computational Electromagnetics."
5,Very Good Used Book,The seller provided an accurate and complete description of the book for sale. The price was good and was delivered earlier than expected. A+++++ Seller!
1,1 star is not low enough.,"This CD is another example of why remakes should be outlawed. It's not worth the electricity it took to produce. The Guitar Man by Bread is a favorite. This version is at the bottom. If you are a diehard fan of Bread. Don't waste your money on this one! Personally, I'd rather hear Micheal Bolton squeal a tune. But, then again one torture is quite enough!"
4,Introducing Rabat...Jura combines...Christmas Tree in space,"The 3rd installment of Vandread...we meet a new character, Rabat, who seems to have something against Hibiki...the two get into an altercation during which Hibiki is pummeled...Jura finally gets to combine with Hibiki's Van, but the result leaves her REALLY disappointed, until she finds out what it can do...Hibiki learns that women have the perogative to change their minds at a moments notice...the men learn about Christmas...The series contiunes the fun from the earlier episodes, while building on the characters. It's definitely a sereies that has kept me curious throughout, and I'm await the closing act with a smile."
2,don't wear it when you attempting to drive,"don't wear it when you attempting to drive on the road. This proudct is bright color but you won't see clear when other vehicle is Signal trying to switch the lane. the worst part is this color of sun clip makes green light even darker , you need to spend 1-2 sencond to make sure if it is really green light or not."
3,So so reading,"Shelter in a Soldier's Arms was a pretty good read, but not one I would like to read over and over like some other of my favorite books, nevertheless I would say that the book is worth reading."
4,Good Story,"Good Read all around. Thought the PTSD the hero experienced was spot on.The struggles of this single mom was a little over the top. But hey it's romance right? This book is number one of two. ******SPOILER ALERT****.In book one"" Shelter In A Soldier's Arms"" heroine gives birth to a little boy named David Jeffrey at the end of the book. In book Two "" A Little Bit Pregnant"" said baby became Michael. This was a big mistake for her editor. I had to recheck while reading the second book just cause i ""thought"" it was wrong. Sure enough it was. It kind of bothered me thru the rest of the story.This book was purchased in 2013 by me. Published in 2001, and 2003 respectively. What happened to updates?"
4,"not bad, but ""apocalypse dudes"" is far better","This was the first album I heard by Turbonegro, and even before I heard anything else by them I thought this album was good, solid punk but not super-great. Much of it is hilarious (like the rant that opens up ""Imorgen Skal Eg Daue"") and there are some great individual songs (such as ""Sailor Man"" and ""I Hate The Kids""). But it's hardly an essential album, and it doesn't hold a candle to ""Apocalypse Dudes,"" which was Turbonegro's next album after this one and a huge improvement over this."
1,"Trash, Pure Garbage","I hate ass cobra, hands down pure garbage. No other words for this band pure trash. End of story. If you disagree with me you are a total idiot."
3,INCOMPLETE!,"turbonegro rocks, this album was great, except...... epitaph has not included my favorite song ""screwed and tattooed"" on their re-release! there's something missing from this version of ass cobra.... the complete playlist. don't settle for this big mac of releases, get the original!"
4,"Ahoy, denim recruits!","Right here kids, Turbonegro's finest hour, er, 38 minutes. Guitars coming at you from both sides, in-yo'-face drums and barked vocals screaming stuff you'd be scared to even dream about: this is deathpunk. The last three songs I could do without, due to the uber-noisy production, and the songs don't mesh with the rest of the album, though the intro to ""Imorgen Skal Eg Daue"" is priceless. Still, this record gives the impression that if fellow Scandinavians the Hellacopters were really all about rock, they'd play songs like ""The Midnight NAMBLA"" or ""Deathtime"""
3,Not Much To Me But The Kid Likes It,"It's very simple. Train goes down into it and comes out the other side through a swinging door. Nothing ""disappears"" unless your train is only an engine and even then it only disappears for a half second. To me it's an over priced slide tunnel. However my three year old loves it, but then he loves anything train related. Are there better train track accessories? Sure are. But I guess if it's a holiday or birthday little Johnny gets what little Johnny wants. (And no, my son's name is not Johnny)"
3,Why must Thomas stuff be sold separately?,"This Thomas piece is lots of fun, but like every other Thomas piece, it is sold on it's own. There needs to be ample amount of straight track beyond the little hill. If it goes immediately to a curve, the train will jump the track. The kids enjoy it, but it's not the first piece they grab for when making a track. Typical of most of the Thomas stuff we own, the extra add on pieces are ones I bought because I think they will look like fun when really the kids are happy with basic figure eights and ovals."
2,Too short,I bought it for my dulcimer but it was too short. Unfortunately there were no measurements on the website to say how long it was. It will NOT fit a regular sized dulcimer. If you buy the Applecreek teardrop dulcimer then it should be okay but other than that don't buy this bag!!
4,nice bag for the price.,For the price this has been a great bag to have to travel with. It would be nicer to have something with some padding but this was all I could find for a travel bag.
2,Misleading Product Description,"This product was not what I envisioned. I wanted an organizer for my drawers containing kitchen tools so that I could easily find spatulas, knives, mixing spoons etc. This appealed to me because the promo brags that you can remove all the partitions and rearrange the interior as you wish. Well, yes to a limited extent.There are two major problems: 1. Ease of use 2. Capacity.Ease of Use: The pegs holding the partitions in place are so stiff and difficult to remove, that I had to call for assistance--I did not have the strength to remove them and I almost broke my fingers trying, they are so deeply wedged into the holes. When you pinch them, they are supposed to come up easily. Forget it!Capacity: Really disappointing. I had more room for all my tools with a smaller organizer and the space left in the drawer than I do using these organizers. They hold far less. As for finding things easily, I was better off without them. Not recommended."
5,Great organizer... Just what I wanted!,Opens up to fit your drawer appropriately. Also stays in place once fitted to correct size. (Feet on bottom) this really helps with a drawer of kitchen tools... They no longer roll around every time I open or close the drawer.
4,better than babies R us,"Great stroller for the price. Went looking for this particular model so it would interface with our car seat. BabiesRUs told me they had it but when I got there, they had to look it up and then told me it was unavailable. Got on Amazon and found it right away for half the price BRU wanted to charge! Requires some assembly and is a little hard to walk with when folded but is still a great system. Fits easily into the trunk of a coupe and unfolds easily and securely. Reccomended."
2,Simple and Cheap,"This stroller was a cheap lightweight stroller, and it had many positives. Unfortunately, the negatives outweighed the positives for me. There is only a simple lap strap and no harness, which is a major safety issue for me! This is definitely a stroller for grandmas house, not for everyday use, unless you are just going for simple strolls. It is very easy to fold, but every time you fold it you must bend down to recline the seat then follow the simple steps to twist and fold down. I found it to be a pain in the neck to keep reclining the seat!!! It is very light and is easy to open. The color was great, but the sunshade was on the small side. If you want simple and cheap this is the stroller for you. It really isn't all that bad, just doesn't have some of the latest aspects many parents are looking for."
3,Somewhat Dissapointed,"The carriage in general is really very good: rolls nicely, easy to open and collapse, storage space on bottom, nice looking. BUT even though it was advertized for infants, the seat belt is only a lap belt and does NOT go over the shoulders. So somewhat dissapointing!!"
5,love it,"exactly as shown, , best price online. it meets my expectations. I would by it again for sure. I would suggest to buy this product here."
4,"Very eay to assemble, light weight","Hey, it's a great price. It's easy to carry up and down multiple flights for those of you who live in walk up buildings. It folds up compact so it's easy to store in small closets and it's easy to fold up and collapse with one hand if you still have to hold your baby. I'm happy with it all in all with the exception of having the tray slam into the floor the first couple of times when I closed it because it took me a few times to realize that you should put the lock on when collapsing the stroller so that it stands when your closing it rather than laying flat. If you do that you'll have no problems definitely holds it's own for this price and it's pattern is very charming."
5,Great Stroller for the Price,"We bought this stroller for our third child. We have a more expensive double stroller for our first two children who are twins. After dealing with the heavy, bulky double stroller for two years, it is nice to have this light-weight stroller. It is easy to to fold and unfold and it maneuvers well. It is a simple stroller that serves its purpose. The cupholders are not deep enough to hold drinks, but I use them for my cell phone and keys. I would definitely recommend buying this stroller instead of a more expensive one!"
3,Aman Garg's review,"I bought this stroller after a lot of research and found it to be one of the cheapest model..The price is quite Ok..But travelling with it in Subways or MTA bus is a mess..It's too bulky..Also sometimes during travel, the rear pair of wheels are makes sound too..I would recommed if you have car, then it's perfect for you otherwise avoid it.."
4,"Nice stroller, could improve on the way it folds","I absolutely love this stroller. The only thing I don't like is the way it folds down. When its folded down the stroller's handle is facing to the bottom, so if you have it sitting on concrete or any rough surface, it will ruin the handle, since its made of foam. I have had a different Graco stroller (part of a travel system) and it folded completely different. Other than that, I love this stroller. VERY light weight, doesn't weigh 20 lbs, I don't have to lug it out of the trunk of my SUV, can be picked up easily. Basket has a good amount of storage space. It's basically a full size stroller that is very light and easy to maneuver. I love the fact that the Graco snug ride car seat can snap right in as well. Would definitely recommend. Just wish Graco would change the way it folds down, to make it similar to their other strollers."
4,Good stroller with a couple faults,"I bought this stroller because I wanted something bigger than an umbrella stroller, but not huge and bulky. On that it delivers. It folds up pretty compactly. It was easy to assemble and is easy to fold and unfold. The seat has two positions, reclined and sitting upright. Both are too extreme, I wish there was an inbetween position. The other thing that is annoying is that when the seat is upright, the sun shade doesn't keep the sun off the baby. I like the three point harness. The basket underneath is huge and easy to access.Edited to add: After a few weeks of use, I decided that the sunshade issue combined with the poor seat recline options, really made this stroller unusable for walks. I also noticed that the seat lacks support and my 8 month old spent most of the walk slouched, sliding or slumped in the seat when it was recline. I opted to sell this stroller and purchase a larger stroller."
4,Cute pattern,Can't wait till my new grand daughter is old enough to spend the day with Nana and Grampy!!! I would definitely purchase it again! Only issue with this stroller; the back of the seat doesn't lay completely flat so isn't easy to change a diaper
3,Baby Rider,"This is a wonderful beginner stroller for the price. It enabled my baby to lay comfortably and stretch herself without having to constantly be crammed in her carrier. The only con is it either lays down completely or sits up at a 90' angle so once she was sitting up on her own she was uncomfortable in it. I wish the recline had an adjustable strap, it only snaps into one position. It is light enough to push around and easy to maneuver. It fits well in grocery and shopping mall aisles. It is wonderful until age 1."
3,An Okay Soundtrack to a Bad Movie,"I bought this CD for one dollar, and it was totally worth the one dollar. I wouldn't have bought it otherwise, but maybe that's just me.The Madonna single is a good song, not so much of a James Bond theme really, but a good song. I'll leave it at that.David Arnold, since taking the role of composing music for the James Bond Movies, has worked his own themes into Bond, sort of made it his own. Which is fine, and I appluad him for doing so. But I didn't really find anything new in this score that he hasn't done before.This soundtrack is loaded with the Bond theme, but made modern for the movie. There are a few other things, but not much. And there was a lot cut from the soundtrack.There are many extras on the CD, but they require you to go to their website...So, in the end, we've got an okay soundtrack to a bad movie."
2,Try Another Way,"I always look forward to Bond soundtrack albums, but this one misses big time. David Arnold's score is loud, boisterous and, with a couple exceptions, completely interchangeable with the scores of the previous two movies. Add to the mix, the worst Bond song in years and you have a very disappointing soundtrack. It may sound better with the movie images it supports, but as a stand alone work, it lacks a lot. The highlights of the CD are the Oakenfold remix and the track ""Welcome to Cuba."" It's better to dig out the John Barry albums and listen to true musical scores."
1,Wanna Be,"David Arnold is nowhere near as good as John Barry. I know John Barry recommended him to the Broccoli clan, but do they listen to the music? Have they tried playing it against Barry's? Please, please... there are other great composers out there I'm sure! Start looking! And do so in non-predictable fashion: No ""names"" unless they can back it up with a good score!"
3,Arnold is Back,"I am certainly glad that David Arnold has done this album and in terms of hearing lots of the JB theme, it is a solid piece of work. Overall, however, he is hampered by a non-melodic theme from Madonna that leaves him w/o a theme to work into the soundtrack to mix w/ the JB theme. The pace on the music is fast which is good; it is a bit redundent of the last two albums. Overall Tomorrow Never Dies is his best work; this current album is probably a bit better than the World is Not Enough. He has mastered and updated the Barry feel for the movies to bring the sound into the 21st century. Perhaps at heart the problem is simply that after 20 films, there is not a lot left that is really going to sound authentic and original at the same time."
4,Maddona ruins this,"I know that there are huge fans of Maddona's music out there, but I am not one of them. The title song for Bond films used to be something that you could hum, whistle or sing to, this one is not. Well I don't buy Bond CD's for the title song I buy it for the score tracks that follow. Continuing what he did for TWINE, David Arnold works with the techno and orchestra together. There are some nice tracks here that are aggressive. I have noticed that there was a lack of a theme for the movie. Tomorrow Never Dies had a theme that was based off of Arnolds song Surrender sung by KD Lang at the end of the film. TWINE had a theme as well, but Die Another Day lacked one or it just wasn't consistantly used. One thing we did here a lot of in the movie was the James Bond theme which was neat. Hey anybody remember the old 007 theme by John Barry. I for one would like to hear that resurrected with a modern twist in the next Bond movie."
1,Yuck.,"Actually another word came to mind but need to write a G-rated review. Starts out in severely distorted mangling of song such that only a few notes each time play then stop, wham, restart, second track is full of scratches of needle across grooves or tape equivalent of running a nail across mastering. Then degenerate rendering of usually beautiful Bond theme. Could get no further into this. Among the 5 worst of several thousand CDs I have heard. Now I do not even want to stream the flick."
3,Not quite what I thought,"It was certainly good, no doubt about that. It just wasn't quite what I was expecting. If you like James Bond movies then I am sure you will certainly enjoy it. Even if not, the musical ability of the composer is very good, the desired effect was certainly achieved. A good CD, worth having. It just wasn't amazing."
4,It slowly gets to you,":)) I liked the song, but that is way too much of it. Overall, it is a nice CD, especially if you are driving long distance."
2,How Dark do you like your Humor?,"If the answer is ""pitch black"" you may enjoy this little comedy. Otherwise, I'd suggest you pass. The plot is uneven and the characters are both desperately unhappy and un-likeable. However that's pretty much the appeal. The absurd situations and pathetic reactions of the characters produce the occasional guffaw and even a belly laugh or two. But the rest of the book is a depressing throw away."
2,thorough yet aimless; detailed yet unclear,"This is a tough book to finish because it isn't clear where the story is. The research is thorough, as you might expect from an author who is ""Professor of Renaissance Studies"". But the book touches on all kinds of scientific advances and technology that would be interesting if explained. Jardine mentions the introduction of the ruby bearing for chronometers. But she doesn't explain or illustrate the jewelled watch movement. By contrast I've watched Gerry Sussman, an MIT EECS professor, hold an audience spellbound with a clear explanation of what the 17 jewels in a 17-jewel watch movement do. Next time Jardine writes about science, I hope that she collaborates with an engineer or scientist and an illustrator."
1,Fail,"This book is at best a tolerable essay on selected efforts in science in northern Europe in the last part of the seventeenth century. The author is capable of competent research but a complete failure at storytelling. There is nothing about the title of the book, the introduction, or anything whatsoever to warn you that whenever the chance is presented to move forward, the author moves backward. The same boring and pedantic details are presented again and again. How many times do we need to be reminded of something that was barely print worthy the first time? Finally, in place of any kind of summary or conclusion, the author presents the most useless information possible about unimportant persons, and then randomly jumps forward 300 years to something totally unconnected and prays in the manner of Newton that the reader will make some leap of faith and find reason. Also by the way, there are only passing references to Kepler on a few pages so don't trust everything you read either."
2,Fact checking?,"I'm pretty disappointed by this book - as other reviewers have said, there are many interesting facts, but it's quite incoherent. And then I start wondering how many are facts. On p.29 of my paperback edition, we learn that Charles II hid in an oak after the battle of Northampton, and then on p. 101 that someone used spectacles for short sightedness for magnifying small objects. This sort of thing is so lazy and sloppy."
4,Good Resource,"This book is a good resource, though not as comprehensive as I would have liked. Its a good intro to the field."
3,"good, but the Vault guides are better","In my opinion there is more and better objective information on Finance and investment banking careers in the Vault Career Guide to Investment Banking and in the Vault Guide to Finance Interviews, which have the added benefit of being able to be purchased on vault.com and downloaded immediately. Good luck."
3,Very technical,"Only buy this book if you want a very technical book about this subject. I bought this book because I was generally interested in this research field... and I never read it. If you are a researcher or a student studying this field, then this might be a good book. Otherwise, there are books that you will probably enjoy more."
2,Interesting,"Drawings & descriptions simple - too much so, but I guess you get what you pay for. Couldn't possibly cover all the rock art symbols, which was disappointing. Cheap paper. Flimsy. B&W drawings with very brief descriptions. Young kids might like it as an introduction to the topic, however."
1,Not the Scott Bath Tissue I remember!,"This is the worst purchase I've made. This is not the tissue you purchase at the grocery store -- this paper feels like sand. I didn't think they made single ply any more - so it was my mistake, but I won't make it again. You know the paper's bad when the toilet paper at your office is better than what you have at home."
4,Rolls last longer,"Put simply, these rolls last longer than other types of toilet paper, including other Scott variants. When it comes to toilet paper, this is about as simple as it gets. With a 1,000 sheets on each roll, you'll find yourself changing the roll less often.I've found these rolls to be extremely cost-effective with my daughter in the house, who tends to use more toilet paper than necessary. I'd recommend these in households with multiple bathrooms and three or more people. Because the rolls last longer, I end up buying less often. These are simply much more convenient."
3,It's okay,It's not the same as what you buy on the shelf at your local supermarket. The paper is much thinner. It's still okay but I don't know if I would order it again.
1,This stuff is terrible!,"This is my first ever review on Amazon. In the past I have never taken the time to complain about a poor quality item because typically there are enough other negative reviews associated with an item for people to make an accurate determination. This bath tissue, on the other hand, is worthy (or not worthy depending on how you see it) of my typing up my first ever review.This stuff is awful. I bought it after seeing it hit one of the deal sites at a decent price with Subscribe and Save. On that particular deal site there were many posts about how one ply tissue could result in tragedy but I thought that I could overcome that by simply using additional sheets. Well... yeah... not so much.I will have to buy additional tissue for general use and try to use the remaining bulk of this to blow noses or... well, I don't know. Maybe I'll just slowly add it to my composer so that I eventually get at least some good out of it."
1,This tissue paper is a bunch of crap.,They are doing what most companies are doing during these hard times and that is cutting corners. The paper there using is some real low grade stuff and is super thin that you can now see threw it and it has holes LOL what a bunch of crap. Oh well now to find some good S*&^ paper.
5,"""Thank you UPS man""","Love the fact that this bulky item gets delivered to my door instead of me having to lug it into my shopping cart, and then into my car and then into my home. Thank you UPS man!!!!!!"
2,"Ouch, Very thin","This is course, thin paper. This is the kind of paper you would find in gas stations/rest areas. Barely usable but will not purchase again. I will make sure the next paper I get is two ply."
1,Stinky Toilet Paper!,"I bought this toilet paper, and it stinks! Whenever I roll it out, it is so thin it rips! THE END."
1,One-ply Tissue,"Well, I should have read all the reviews before buying this, because nowhere on the page does it tell us that this is ONE PLY tissue. It did arrive the next day, which is pretty amazing, but we don't do 1-ply here."
2,"It's ok, but please note it is 1-Ply Toilet Paper","In a civilized world there should never be 1-ply toilet paper. That's the one place you want to make sure there are plenty of ply's available.Nowhere in the product description does it tell you this is 1-Ply, and so I made the mistake of buying two huge packages of it (the price was good), only to discover that I'm having to pull too much off the roll then fold it up to make my own 2-ply toilet paper. It's wasteful.I am giving this product 2 stars for the following reasons:- Poorly marketed. Should be very clear that the product is 1-ply.- The fact that is it 1-ply in the first place, for such a sensitive body area.- I have to waste too much of it to create my own 2-ply.- I'm frustrated."
1,Did you think shrinking the width of the paper would go unnoticed?,"It seems that, in order to maintain 1000 sheets per roll, Scott has lopped a half inch or so from the width of the sheets. Do you really think consumers are so stupid that this move would go unnoticed? I've been buying Scott tissue for years, but will be changing to a company that doesn't take such a dishonest approach to raising prices."
1,Not the same quality anymore!!!,"Scott has reduced the size of the rolls and cheapened the quality of the product. This was the only brand I would purchase for as long as I can remember. No more! The less expensive 1000 sheet store brands are now of better quality than this Scott product. The width of the ""new"" Scott product has been reduced considerably. The sheets have been embossed to make them fluffier, and the spindle has been made larger, resulting in a roll that is the same outer diameter but with less paper. Like the ""new improved"" Coca Cola that failed miserably, I hope that Scott comes out with a ""Classic Scott"" with the size and quality their premium price demands."
1,Incredible Shrinking Rolls,"I never thought they'd do it, but Scott has resorted to the same cheap tactics as it's competitors. Now it's no longer a great deal on quality toilet paper. They're shrinking the widths of their rolls like the other brands have done. I told myself if Scott started doing this, I'd stop buying it. I'm gonna bring my measuring tape to the store to find a replacement."
3,You use the same amount as the regular sized rolls,"Since becoming a Prime member I started trying to find everyday items that I use at home and sign up for a subscription. It can actually be cheaper than buying them at the store and save you time and gas money, etc. I found this tissue and according to the amount of sheets per roll I figured it was a good deal and to give it a try. Well, what I didn't read was that each sheet is only 1 ply. You end up using just as much as the smaller rolls to make up for the ply difference. I also compared prices at my local store and found that this is also more expensive to buy from Amazon. I canceled my subscription. The subscriptions on here are great but you really have to compare prices elsewhere to make sure you're getting a good enough deal to make it worth your while in buying in bulk."
1,ONE PLY- WHAT???????,Nowhere in the product description does it say 1-ply. I can't find a place to complain to Amazon.
3,Does the intended task but that's about all,Somewhat course. Kind of paper you would find in gas stations/rest areas. Usable thank goodness since I just purchased 40 rolls but will not purchase again.
1,flimsy product,The quality of this product is sub-par. I have to fold it at least twice when I wipe because it is so thin compared to other brands (there have been cases of accidents!). It is also rough textured; I rather not have a raw hide on the daily. One time I had to clean up some intimate parts of my body and Scott toilet paper was all I had on hand. The toilet paper was so flimsy that it got stuck on my skin and it quickly dried up causing my to go SCRUB in the shower. Imagine SCRUBBING down there!
3,"""Neh"" as a cat would say","It's okay. Dragged a bit. Some of the story is implausible--but not outrageously so.Although I didn't dislike the main character, I'm not sure I cared for her either.As the main character's cat would say ""Neh"".I like cats; if you absolutely adore and are crazy about cats, your affinity might carry you through the book.Language: * (1 out of 5 where 1 = no profanity; 5 = PROFANE.)Sex: ** (2 out of 5 where 1 = no sex; 5 = porn.)Violence: ** (2 out of 5 where 1 = no violence; 5 = VIOLENT!)(Sex and Violence are both really one and half stars--I felt I couldn't say there was no sex and violence with one star.)"
4,cute!!,A cute read for those of us who like cats and mysteries. Would definitely go further into what else this author might offer us.
4,Great!,"It was a delightful, easy to read ""whodunit"". I enjoy anything with cats so it was fit for me. I could recommend it to anyone."
5,Mew,Love a little mystery...I read all the Cat Who books and loved them...this is book similar to those...I like books with cats helping to solve the mystery
3,Mew for Murder by Clea Simon,Book is in new condition but seems to have come from Massachusetts Regional LibrarySystem with no indication that it was discarded.
4,Mew is for Murder,a really fun book to read and very well written. I started to read it in the morning and couldn't put it down.
3,Entertaining,"I have to say this was entertaining to read. I love cats and a good mystery and this was both. It did keep me engaged, although halfway through, it was pretty obvious who was the culprit. But I still liked it."
3,Mew is for murder,"This was a good light reading. I interspersed it with a heavier reading for a break and found the plot easy to return to. I usually have two books on the go at the same time, one heavy and one light reading. This one was enjoyable as the light reading."
3,Mew is for Murder,"I enjoyed this book. It was lighthearted and entertaining. It is the first one I've read about Theda Krakow, and will probably read more in the future."
2,Slow....really slow.,"I thought I would enjoy this book, but I found it too slow. The mystery of who killed Lillian was well thought out, but Theda's personal life seemed like it was just added to make the book longer...it didn't seem to have much bearing on the plot. This could have been a good short story."
5,Meowsa!,"After the 'Cat Who' series this has to be one of my favorites, hands down. With real characters and self-satisfied cats I loved it!"
3,Mew is for Murder:A Theda Krakow Mystery,"""Mew is for Murder"" is the first book written by Theda Krakow that I have read, and it seems to be the first book of a series. I am sure the characters will develop and the plots will be more complex as the series progresses."
4,I enjoyed reading this book,"This book kept my interest all the way through. Even though I am not a cat lover, I was rooting for them too. Liked the ending."
4,Mew is for Murder,"Many times I agree heartily with one- and two-star reviews, but for me this book is a solid four-star; I'm not sure the other reviewers read the same book. I love dog and cat mysteries and prefer plots with only gentle hints of profanity, violence, blood, gore and sex...I guess cozies are the ones that work best for me. Clea Simon's writing style ticks all the boxes, and there's an additional huge box checked off as well...excellent editing. What a joy! What a relief, not to be forced to reread constantly to decipher the errata and compelled to note a correction wherever the author's intent can be divined. I will be reading the rest of her three series if and when they fall into my price range (free) or maybe even break over and pay for them...they're that good!"
3,MEW IS FOR MURDER,Mew is For Murder:This book is a very slow starter. I almost decided to quit reading it several times . Midway through the book it got better.
4,A good read,If you like mysteries it is a good read. First book I've read from Clea Simon and will be reading more. This is part of the Theda Krakow Series and will be getting the rest of the series.
3,Not so much! Found it boring.,"One day I will try to get interested in this book again. I have completely lost all focus, it became boring. Maybe when I try again...something will hit me and I will get interested again."
3,Pretty good....,"Cute premise...nice characters and pretty believable. Not sure I'd read any more, but I might be enticed with a free book!"
3,Enjoyable if not overly deep,"I am a cat lover so when I saw that this was a free Kindle edition, I checked it out. A magazine that I'd read had also reviewed it so it sounded promising, especially because I was looking for an entertaining, somewhat-lighthearted mystery series to read after ""quitting"" a previous one.The cat aspect was a draw for me because I very much love cats. Characters seemed to be described well, although the plot got draggy in some parts. At the risk of spoiling the ending, I felt that there was one scene involving a cat's reaction that gave everything away when the book had previously been doing a great job of keeping the culprit, well, a mystery. There was still a twist in the end, but parts of that were borderline improbable too (the cat finds an important thing for them).The book was entertaining, though, and I will be checking out the other books in the series. Overall it was a quick, fun read and any cat lover will enjoy it."
4,Busy,"Even if you're not a ""cat person"", this book will keep you entertained. If so, it may be even more enjoyable. With murder, arson, theft, and tresspassing, the mystery is woven around a freelance journalist and her eclectic interests. A fun read."
4,Enjoyable read!,"I thought this book was very enjoyable. I love mysteries and I try to figure out who did it before the end, but I had keep reading until the very end to find out. I look forward to reading the next book in the series."
5,Mew is for Murder by Clea Simon,I love cats and books about cats. This was a very good mystery story that I enjoyed very much and folks who enjoy this genre should enjoy..
4,Cute cat involvement,Not the most unpredictable mystery ever but worth the read. I enjoyed the cats of the story and there was enough of a twist at the end to make me happy with the plot.
1,Disappointing,"As a cat and mystery lover I was hoping this would be right up my alley. Thankfully it was free and I will be able to move on to something else. The story was way too long, utterly predictable (to the point I wanted to reach into my kindle and strangle Theda for a variety of reasons), the characters were very one-dimensional and it completely lacked humor. Theda is quite possibly the most boring 30 something I've ever read about. It seems like she was written by a conservative 50 something wishing she was 30 again with no concept of what it's like to be in her 30's. When the cats are more interesting than the human characters, it's time to move on."
3,3.5 stars - A well-done debut,"More a traditional mystery than a cozy, this is a delightful debut. The characters and dialogue are convincing, including, for those of us who love our pets, Thea's conversations with the cats-no, the cat's aren't verbal. Simon clearly loves Boston and knows the music scene. The plot is tight and believable. The book is lighter than I normally read, but it was enjoyable."
3,a real good read,"This is a book from Clea Simon that I liked very much. Not that I did not like any others by her. This is my first and I will read more by her because it is a wonderful read. Enjoyed the characters and the cats. It all comes together for a good time.J. Robert Ewbank author ""Wesley's Wars"" and ""John Wesley, Natral Man, an the Isms"""
4,Mew is for mystery,"With empathy for love and concern for the stray cats, I enjoyed following Theda through the mystery of the murder and her changing life...this is a good bed time read."
2,Mew is for Murder,The ending was good and I enjoyed the cats and especially her new kitten but the rest of the book was just junk. The story line wasn't very believable either! Every article she was going to write on felt like she was just lecturing me.....and no one that I know enjoys being lectured!
2,Slow Plot,The book was an ok read. The plot was really slow and there wasnt much of a mystery to it.
4,Mew is for Murder,"Mew is for Murder. just finished the book. Kept me in suspense through out the book and tried to figure the outcome, but couldn't. Was happy it ended the way it did!!"
4,Enjoyable Read,"Very entertaining. Good plot, good characters. Theda is definitely head strong. (good qualities). Looking forward to reading about Theda again.Author of ""Scratch's Story"""
4,Mew Is For Murder,"I looked for a mystery that would keep my interest and found it in Clea Simon's: Mew Is For Murder. I found myself doubly rewarded with a birds eye look into the life of a free-lance writer. The characters were believable and the mystery compelling. I would recommend a read to any mystery fan, lover of felines, or any reader interested in the world of free-lance.Mew is for Murder (Theda Krakow Mysteries, No. 1)"
4,MEW MEW,"I enjoyed this book. It does have a bit too much irrevelant material in it, which causes it to drag in spots. All in all it is a good light read. I wish the Cat had been more involved with the story, but then I am a CAT LADY. I think you will enjoy this book if you want something you can put down when you need to and pick up again when you have time. It is not an edge of the seat thriller."
4,Mew is for Murder,"Easy read, kept my interest and made me want to read on, didn't anticipate the 'bad person'. I enjoyed it"
4,Delightful,"For mystery lovers and cat lovers this book satisfies both very well. This is a story that is hard to put down once started. The characters are interesting and well developed. The garage and music scene is not a usual subject but the author captures the seting in an authentic manner. There are several focal points that are unexpected but interesting. Cambridge as a community, the bar scene, magazine publishing, and the real estate market. The writer brings youthful spirit to the writng that is refreshing. Reading this is a fun way to spend a few hours."
4,well done mystery,this mystery is well written and conceived. it holds your interest and is a fun read. the characters are well drawn and there is a pleasant plot twist.
2,Didn't hold my attention,Sorry but I just couldn't get any sort of liking for the characters. I guess I am just not that much of a cat/pet person because I think of them as pets not people.
3,Anything cats is good!,Not use to reading one book over 4 weeks. My own fault I could not get into it. Did like the writing style.
4,Lovely read,"I was pleasantly suprised by this wonderful book! A light read with interesting characters, a murder mystery, and of course, cats."
1,Cats care,I love my cats and i enjoyed this story because it makes the readers think about helping animals and the love and comfort they give to us.
1,If you do not like cats - do not read this book.,"I can take or leave cats. In this case, I will ""leave"" them.I felt it was primarily a book for cat lovers only. The ""mystery"" storyline was secondary to the cats. If you like cats, this book is for you."
4,Was the cat lady murdered?,"Did the lady who most believed to be a cat hoarder really die a natural death? Theda Krakow is thrown into examining her death. It's not like Theda doesn't already have enough of her own problems but she can't help herself. Along the way she meets some unusual memorable characters.This is a great light, fun kind of mystery and if you like to read murder mysteries this book will give you something just a little different. As of today, the Kindle version is free, so grab it if you can."
2,Ok story,I thought the storyline was ok but there was too much unnecessary information in the book. It made me want to put the book down and stop reading.
3,Pfaltzgraff Winterberry Soup/Cereal Bowl,"The description on these bowls fails to mention the actual size, and they are not very big, maybe 6"". The Pfaltzgraff website lists them at 12 ounces. I was expecting a much bigger bowl, similar to the ones I have for my Pfaltzgraff Tea Rose set, about 20 ounces. It's a good idea to check other sites for better descriptions of all Pfaltzgraff items, so you really know what you are getting.The quality and similarity to older pieces has declined somewhat now that everything seems to be made in China. I have found significant differences in size and shape, which affects how they stack, since the change."
4,Super Reader,"This one is definitely more light hearted, and pretty much a straight spoof-of-the-poms. The monarchy, Douglas Adams, The Professionals, James Bond, etc., etc. Oh yes, and To The Manor Born. With bondage gear. Very scary.Very amusing, laugh out loud funny at times. Again ND is up for execution as someone frames him for the assassination of the Queen Mother.His friends here, while in the Tower of London, are basically putting on a Monty Python/Black Adder routine for most of the book."
1,Deck is messed up,"I ordered a few decks. The blue caesars cards had 2 King of hearts and 2 6 of hearts, instead of diamonds."
1,still missing parts,Unit received in 6 separate boxes. I still have not received all of the parts. Therefore I cannot even assemble it. The vendor has not been very responsive.
1,stainless steel tool box,I just gave the tool box I recieved in the mail to my husband for Christmas and it arrived BROKE. Both of the locks were broke with the plastic laying at the bottom of the packaging. I am very upset and disappointed. There is no way he can use this tool box. Who ever packaged this item had to of seen this defect. There is actual wholes in the plastic where they locks should of been. I need to get this returned or refunded but have no way of contacting the seller. This was embarassing for me to pass this broken tool box as a gift.
5,great toolbox,"I got this for my uncle for christmas (his other one had a broken handle and was old and junky) the inner part for the smaller tools seems a bit flimsy, but so far (a week or two) its held strong with his MANY tools, and working handle ;)great tool box for the price"
2,Sorry,"Just never found a use for it, it wasn't exactly what i wanted. A little lite for the things i was going to use it for. Thanks"
4,Good box,"This is a pretty light tool box, and has nice compartments, just the right size for the average person who needs to keep the most important tools with them. It's a good toolbox, heavy duty enough to throw around a little and not worry."
3,I looks cool BUT....,I really like the size of the tool box and how well it stacks on other items. The handle is recessed in the lid. Its very Lite duty! I want to put a padlock on this Tool Box however most good locks would not even fit the tool box. You would have to drill out the hole bigger. But it wouldn't matter the pastic around it is so thin that all you would have to do is twist the lock and the plastic would fall apart! Very Cheap! If you dont care about locking it then buy it. Most people dont care about locking a tool box. I think you will be happy with it. Very nice looking.
3,The Sleeping Giant of Goll,"This book is The Sleeping Giant of Goll. The characters are Eric, Julie, Neal, and Sparr. It starts in an island with talking trees. This is a fiction book.These three kids enter a secret stairway to Droon where weird things happen like trees can attack. But there's a evil guy named Sparr who wants to take over Droon. Now Sparr unleashed a old giant to help him take over Droon. Then a mysterios blue dragon comes to kill the giant.I rcamond this book because it's really funny."
2,More drivel in Droon,"Although my first-grader begs for these books when we see them in the bookstore, they rarely hold her interest past one reading. The writing is sophomoric, the situations and characters so derivative as to be generic. With many wonderful children's books in the world, why resort to the uninventive world of Droon?"
4,Load up the coal!,Skyler loves this piece. It does have alot of plastic parts but seems very sturdy and no problems so far. It's easy to fit into a layout. Some briges or destinations where tracks intersect can be frustrating to try to fit into a layout.
3,Paul Hardcastle double cd greatest hits cd,"Among the old favorites on this double disk cd are some interesting re-recordings of other artists' songs; and although as a hits album it is padded with mediocre material and several anti-vietnam/anti-war tracks, it does still have a few interesting tracks to enjoy. At first I thought the first actual track (which is an anti-war/anti-vietnam track) was ok and then as the cd progresses it turns out there are 3 anti-vietnam tracks so I began to think that this cd is padded with average or below-average material. Some people are trying to forget that era of history...(but then again I realize that this cd was not recently released, it is dated). I like Paul Hardcastle's music for the electronic instrumental tracks; he includes on this cd some vocals that are ok but some I don't care for. I do think it is a good cd to add to anyone's collection even though most greatest hits cd's recycle previously recorded material."
3,Awful sound quality!,"This third-stream album is an absolute masterpiece, but the heavily compressed mastering here makes this reissue difficult to listen to. A short-lived, hard-to-find French reissue has somewhat better sound, but there's a noticable rumble that should have been addressed during mastering. Since the chances of SONY remixing this album from the three-track session reels are nil, listeners should seek out an original RCA Victor LP pressing, particularly the more effective mono mix."
1,"perfumey, ruined my dish!","thoroughly disappointed in these bay leaves! they look beautiful but when i opened the jar they smelled very strong and unfamiliar; in other words, they smelled nothing like other bay leaves i've used in the past. i took a chance anyway, and threw a couple of them in my gumbo. what a mistake! it made the entire dish so perfumey it became inedible! i'm very upset and these expensive bay leaves will be going straight into the trash."
2,Some of them doesnt work. CHeap quality CDRs,"Their quality is cheap. so do their price. Out of the 25 CDs, atleast 8 of them failed. The rest, okay. I would suggest Verbatim. They are pretty good."
3,"They work, but they are not very sturdy","I have bought many CDs before. These are good, but they scratch very easily. If you want some CDs, shop around for Sony. Sony CDRs are the best. These are great for their price. I got mine free after rebate, so Im not really complaining. I plan on using these to store some old data from my computer. I wont be touching the CDs much, so I doubt they will get scratched. If you are looking for some CDRs to copy music and use in your car, etc - then go for something better."
1,Don't buy these,These CDR's are NOT PRINTABLE. There are red lines and red and blue graphics on the surface. The item description is incorrect. Don't waste your time and money like I did.
1,very bad cdrs,"only have about 350mb capacity... after i burnt a less than 350mb file, i can not add any other files in it. and when i burnt a more than 400mb files, failed, and the cd is damaged--- the file (400mb)i burnt can not be read."
1,RUGGED RIDGE EURO GUARD HEAD LIGHT PROTECTORS,"IF I WAS RUGGED RIDGE I WOULD NOT HAVE MY NAME ASSOCIATED WITH THE FRONT HEAD LIGHT GUARDS..THE WELDS WERE HANGING ON BY NO MORE THAN 1/8 "". I COULD BEND THEM WITH VERY LITTLE EFFORT. IT WAS NOT WORTH THE EFFORT OF PULLING THE GRILLE OFF TO PUT THIS JUNK ON MY JEEP WITH $10,000 + OF MODIFICATIONS. I SPEND SEVERAL THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR ON INTERNET PURCHASES AND THIS IS THE BIGGEST PIECE OF JUNK I HAVE EVER SEEN. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY."
3,Not long lasting scent,"I buy blue Q car fresheners for the image and the humour however, the scent doesn't last as long as some cheaper, grocery store bought brands, nor is it a very strong fragrance. Mine typically last about a week. Good, if you want some humour, but not the strongest for scenting your car up."
1,Headache inducing garbage,"When I ordered this, I knew it would be bogus. Hercules Unchained wasn't filmed in 3D. However, since this claimed to be widescreen and the 101 minute UK release, I thought I'd take a chance. What this is is something that has been altered to give the viewer a headache inducing experience that will cause eyestrain with or without glasses (and don't bother ordering this if you don't have your own pair of those old cardboard glasses - glasses don't come with this bogus release).Now to the length of this film. It clocks in at just under 90 minutes, which makes it the shortest version released so far, including all those funky PD companies. The U. S. theatrical release of this film ran 15 minutes longer. The picture quality is absolutely horrible. This is one of the best of the sword and sandal epics. Hopefully some company will do a proper job of it eventually."
3,Anaglyph glasses not included...,"...so you'll need red-and-blue lens of your own. Unlike the 3-D versions of COLOSSUS AND THE HEADHUNTERS and COLOSSUS AND THE AMAZON QUEEN, this print is anamorphic scope, and has decent quality, but if you get headaches from 3-D (anaglyph), you'd best stick with the available flat version. Please note that this disc is all-region but in the PAL (European) format, so it will not play on NTSC-only players and TVs. A DTS 5.1 audio option doesn't seem to work and you get pink-noise static on that track. The standard 2.0 audio track plays fine (and it's matrixed monophonic).Those interested in peplums (and capable of converting PAL to NTSC) should get some cheap thrills with this release."
5,Cool!,School is out because of a raging snowstorm. The kids are excited! But their bus gets stranded on a deep snow bank and they are forced to find shelter and the only place is an abandoned farm.
5,Great Razor Edger,"I use the Razor Edger as a professional Barber. In my opinion, these trimmers cut as good as if not better than other major brands, if your client has clean dry hair. They are especially crisp when edging young boys who don't have a lot of nasty grease and sweat. Most of my clients including my son get compliments on how crisp their hair stlye is. The narrow blade on the razor edger comes in handy when edging above the eybrow and the client has a low hairline. They don't get as hot as the Andis outliner, but does require oil as well as all other trimmers. This is a great tool to have in your kit."
4,Cuts well,This product truely gives a professional razor edge but the machine blades bite (irritate the skin)leaving scrathes. Maybe someone can advise me on how i can stop that.
1,Stopped working after 3 months,"I have used quite a number of clippers and I struggle between finding one that can provide a close shave, while not being overpriced. This clipper I purchased on Amazon works well when it works, but by the third month of using this product (3 times a week on average), I noticed it needs about 5-10 minutes after being turned on before the blades begin to move. The blades will literally not move and I now find myself hunting for another clipper because I quite honestly don't want to be waiting the same time period as my wife does with her flat iron to heat up, each time I want to shave.I checked the blades to see if any of them were loose and I even checked the electrical socket to see if I was using the wrong cycle - its never been a problem with my other clippers but I wanted to cover my base and be sure. I had chosen Wahl because I had confidence in the brand but with this experience I now have another clipper search ahead of me."
5,The Bronx is NOT Burning,My boyfriend ordered TWO. His original one is old and has fallen apart. He was pleased with the price and availability.
5,LOVE IT <3<3<3,"Well....... I love it..... It really does cut as close as a razor. My customers love the nice clean sharp lines , even the ladies love it when we do a short style and have to get rid of those pesky neck hair........ They say it cuts so close the don't have to get a friend or their husband/ boyfriend to do it, in between services........ There is nothing bad I can say about this......... It does not get hot like other I have had, so no more burning your client...... Also it is great for facial hair as well...... Once again, nice clean sharp lines."
3,These are wooden train set additions.,These Brio Bob the Builder trucks are meant to compliment their train set. They are the same size and price as the trains and fit on the track. For a child that enjoys playing with his wooden trains and track these make a great addition. If you are just looking for a toy Bob the Builder truck go with the talking vehicles.
2,Not worth the Money!,"My Nephews are the Biggest Bob the Builder fans!! But this toy is the SMALLEST toy and definitely not worth the money!! If you want something to decorate the topy of a birthday cake with this MIGHT work although still a little small. Bob is only an inch high at the most. I wish I had listened to the other reviewer below who asked ""Why does this cost so much for so little?"""
1,Scoop and Bob,"I found the advertising misleading. I expected the Scoop and Bob to be larger than they were. I think this toy is probably good for collecting, but not for a 3 year old."
3,Small but great for little guys.,This has the all the details and durability of brio trains. I'm sure my grandson will enjoy imaginative play and I may purchase additional pieces of the series. It's a bit overpriced compared to other brio products. That's why I rated it three stars instead of five.
5,This toy is great!,"I am so happy to see that Brio has added the Bob the Builder characters! Brio is a wonderful, durable toy that my son has always enjoyed. He is also a big Bob the Builder fan. Adding Bob and the crew is great!"
5,You must go with this flow,"As a yoga practitioner for over 25 years, I find Micheline's DVD to be a perfect guide for my home practice. For beginner's, Micheline's detailed instructions are simple and clear, and for the more advanced, her vinyasa sequence is well rounded, complete and beautifully paced for any level.Her voice and beautiful music put you right where you need to be for a fabulous yoga experience."
3,Shiva Rea-like,"Micheline Berry is a student of Shiva Rea. How do I know that? Well you can hear it in the way she explains the poses. She even uses Shiva's phrases. But she isn't Shiva Rea and something was missing for me in this dvd. I kept waiting for her to let loose with free style movement the way Shiva does in her Flow dvd. What I like about Shiva Rea dvds is that you get challenging poses as well as easy poses all on one dvd. I'm spoiled. This dvd is really, trully for beginners. After viewing it once and doing it twice, I was bored. Nothing to grow into..so I returned it. So if you have been practicing yoga for awhile, skip this one and try the intermediate dvd. What I love about Shiva Rea yoga flow is that it is like a dance and I love the creative combination of dance and yoga. Perhaps the intermediate dvd will have more free form movement and creativity. We can only hope!"
2,Vinyasa Flow Yoga for Beginners,I was disappointed in this DVD. Three things bothered me: (1) This is definitely NOT for beginners; (2) I objected to all the Hindu religious elements; and (3) The water meditation segment would have worked far better for me had it not been accompanied by vocal music and had the images not continuously been interspersed with Hindu religious icons.
5,entertaining,"My almost 3 year old first played with this briefly at a nature center. He is thoroughly entertained by it. Matches all the pieces appropriately and loves the magnetic component of it. All of the magnets appear to be very secure, with the exception of the ""net"" magnet. I just cant tell what holds that in and my infant daughter loves that piece, unfortunately. Great buy."
5,Great puzzle!,"I purchased this puzzle for my 17 month old daughter for Christmas. She loves it.It is a great tool to teach hand eye coordination. It took her about 1 day to go from holding the magnet directly over the puzzle piece, to being able to hold the net from the handle. Now she's a pro! I have so many Melissa and Doug puzzles. They are great!The ONLY thing that isn't great is... If your child still puts everything in his/her mouth, the paper on top of the wood pieces ,will come off some. I only let her have the puzzle while I'm right with her!I plan to buy the Ocean creature puzzle next!"
5,puzzle with a net,The grandchildren have fun with this one. Be aware that the net becomes a swinging toy.
3,Very Cute,"This puzzle is really cute, fun, and durable, but as is the case with most children's puzzles, the pieces are long gone. I'm not sure where puzzle pieces go, but I suspect they're somewhere with the missing socks."
4,Fun game,"This is an easy, fun, ""puzzle"" game. The only problem with it is keeping track of the pieces. I try to put it awayas soon as the kids are done with it because once the pieces are out of sight, they are hard to find."
4,Fun yet educational,My 19 month son loves this. Figured out the magnetic pole right away. He also identified the insects right away. He puts them in his mouth however and the paper comes off. You might want to wait until your child is past the put everything in my mouth stage. Other than the pictures not holding up its a fun entertaining game.
2,Fun Idea but hard to use,The concept of this puzzle is great and would be very fun but the wooden pieces of the puzzle fit too tightly. My 3 year old can get the magnet to stick to the piece but it then detaches while trying to pull it out. To put a piece back in she has to use her other hand to tap the piece into place. I love Melissa and Doug but just cannot recommend this puzzle.
4,Great young toddler toy!,"My son got this as a gift for his 2nd birthday and really liked it immediately. It is noise-less, which I appreciate after all the dozens of noisy / musical / talking toys. I like that the idea is simple, but teaches hand-eye coordination. The toy is a beautiful simple wooden panel with bug cut-outs. Each bug has a small metal piece, allowing you to ""catch"" the bugs with the magnetic bug net. It is very colorful and now my son can name each bug - ""ladybug"", ""firefly"", ""dragonfly"" and so on.I would definitely recommend this toy."
5,Love it!,My son is 19 months old and he LOVES this toy. It did not take long for him tho get the hang of it.... he cannot get the pieces back in the puzzle but he really enjoys taking them off with the bug net.
5,Awesome Tea,An excellent tea from Canada. I could only find two makers and to get the same tea from the other maker the cost was triple including shipping.
4,Pretty Good,This doorbell is pretty cool. It has different options for the number of chimes and it is easy to post the button by door. But sometimes it goes off when there is no one at the door. Weird...
2,Works but not very loud...,very cheap plastic - housing cracked during installation - caveat emptor! you get what you pay for - i would not purchase again.
5,Great Value!,"I was looking for a cheap wireless doorbell for my apartment. I chose this one because it is one of the cheaper options and it seemed to have good reviews. After it arrived I installed the push button and doorbell, it turned out to be quite loud, so much so that I had to turn down the volume My apartment is small however, so if you have a large house this should work for you as well. It has a few different tones and all the hardware to install it. Overall great product!"
5,Nice Door Bell,"my old doorbell went out on me so i looked around and found this one, works like a charm, easy set up."
5,Perfect 21st Century Solution,"My doorbell stopped working. I really didn't feel like chasing wires, transformers, etc., throughout the house. When I heard that there were wireless doorbells available, I thought, ""Of course! This is the twenty first century! Why use a 19th century technology?""I selected this particular Heath-Zenith product, although there were many others with slightly different capabilities (more or fewer chime options; multiple doors; plug-in rather than battery; etc.). I also picked this one because the outdoor button could be screwed to the door jamb; many only had the option of double-stick tape, which struck me as unreliable.It installed in minutes. It works great. I'm completely happy with it. How often can you say that?"
2,60 Feet Too Much,"We had a similar unit that was rated at 100 feet that did not work. We purchased this unit that was half again greater in distance, hoping that would make a difference. Sad to say, this product is intermittent at best.Application:We have a gate that is 60 feet away from our front door. The chime unit is inside and above the front door. We tested several placement locations before affixing the chime, and high provided the best signal reception. After the installation, we find the chime does not always pick up the signal.If the button is pressed several times and held, the chime tends to work. But when was the last time UPS or FedEx took so much time to ring the bell?The unit works when the distance is short, such as described by the other raters. Just beware if the distance is greater than, say 50 feet."
2,Bad buttons,"We have several doorbell units at different places in the house so we can be sure to hear a caller. The door bell units are fine. BUT, the buttons are LOUSY! Unless you press them just right they don't send a signal to the doorbell. And, they don't stand the weather well if they are fully exposed. It's very upsetting to have people walk away or deliveries dropped on the door step when it's freesing outside and you didn't even know someone was there."
5,Loved it. Worked right out of the box,"I had bought a different brand of wireless door chime for about twice the price. It never worked right. The chimes only worked a couple of times, the batteries were almost impossible to install or remove, just a real pain. The Heath/Zenith SL-6153 worked first time, right out of the box, with none of the problems of the other brand."
1,DON'T get this book for layout inspiration,"This book takes a total graphic artists approach to layout - after you get through the first half of the book dedicated to simple web terminology and technology like CSS and HTML with very simplistic explanations. Even then, it does nothing with the nuts and bolts, but rather tells you things like ""CSS allows you to specify exact font size"".When you DO get to the layout section, they take only the most artistic sites to review - and then they're not even broken down to see how they're put together. It's just page after page of screenshots and little quips like ""here's that white background again!""It's little more than a coffee table book - one suitable only for graphiuc designers who fancy switching mediums. If you're looking for ideas and inspiration for practical web layouts, look ELSEWHERE!"
3,Beautiful but Dumb,"This book is filled with gorgeous images and beautiful screen captures (500 to be exact); however, its content seems to be lacking a bit. There is little mention of how to use tables, frames, templates, and other important tools for Web-site development. Also, the key mantras of many graphic designers (such as consistency, themes, relevancy, etc.) are not included. Though the pictures are perfect, you really have to read the captions to learn anything important about Web layout. For better information on Web layout, go to Robin Williams' and John Tollett's ""The Non-Designer's Design Book"" or ""The Non-Designer's Web Book."""
2,Choose one that doesn't take as much guesswork,"1. The directions are detailed, but confusing, Even though the directions contain pictures, you would do well to look up pictures and descriptions on the web of different types of scissors.2. Still looking for replacement stones. Mine are already grooved after ten pairs of scissors.3. Since I managed to run several pairs of scissors due to not understanding parts of the directions, I will be opting for the Chef's Choice 500 model to eliminate some of the guesswork"
5,One for the parental toolkit!,"This is an outstanding addition to my ever growing parental toolkit. I have raised one adult and I'm currently raising a nine year old girl. If only the book had been available to me when I was raising my son, I might not have made so many mistakes. Though I've learned from my mistakes, the book solidifies my concept of rules and consequences for lack of rules. Regardless of age, social status or economic status, there is something for everyone.This book is a must for all parents!"
5,It works like a charm,"I've used this only once and it is the only product of this type that I have used, but I absolutely LOVE the Odif 505 Spray and Fix Temporary Fabric Adhesive. I learned of it from a youtube quilting tutorial, so followed the ""instructor's"" directions about using a protected wall to hang and spray my small quilt on. I didn't manage it quite so easily as the ""expert,"" but I got it all put together; and it stayed together the entire time it took me to quilt it. I am glad I found this product. It works wonderfully, and it saves so much time and frustration, keeping all the layers in place, perfectly."
4,Planet Asia= DOPE MC,This is Planet Asia's second album and if it werent for a couple poor atemtps at comercialism early on in the album this would be a bonafide classic I loved 95% of the tracks on this disc and found asia to be a pretty formidable lyricist I enjoyed his laid back street knowledge type flows that work really well with this type of west coast style on this CD. If you are a fan of Wild Child or The Alkaholiks you gotta check this guy out. while not a classic this is one of the west coast undergrounds finest.
3,Planet Asia is Tight!.,"Planet Asia is tight, but a couple of the songs are too simple. His voice, flow, and tone are great, but the music production needs to be of equal quality consistently. I'll probably buy his next one as well."
4,Got something to ask!,"first of all: that album is amazin!""As long as I'm alive"" what's the beat playin??something 2pac??thx and holla at ya"
2,disappointment,first off i think asia is one of if not the phatest mc's from CA. still in training was hot but this one i really wasnt feelin. i listened to it a couple times and the wackness still shined thru. no disrespects to asia i still think hes hot but grand opening isnt good at all.
2,Not as effectual as desired.,"I was somewhat disappointed after using this pedal for a few days, in that the effect produced was minimal unless turned to the maximum position, at which point an undesired amount of distortion was introduced."
2,DIstorted,"Sorry folks, but this ain't a Dyna-Comp by any stretch. My mistake was thinking that this unit would be but a little more control. The attack control on this thing goes from full-squash to almost nothing. Unfortunately, besides compressing the daylights out of the signal, it adds some very unpleasant distortion as well - not what it's suppose to do at all. I should have saved my money for a Keely."
1,Ugh. Worst book I've read all year,"I'm surprised at all the 5 star reviews I see for this book (one of the reasons I bought it), but this book is the worst book I've read in the last 3-4 years (so worst out of 30?).I found the author's writing style to be very painful to read. This is one of those books that would be better as a 20 page reseach paper. I thought the model the author presents is interesting, and I can believe it, but the delivery of the information was just painful. I threw the book away after reading it. It's not a keeper.The data to back this research is pretty sparse. I would have thought there would be more. The case studies are very small and very watered down."
1,Bad bad book,"You could sum all of this book's content in just one page, even one paragraph: Design processes on the basis of usability. Include in process design activities people who will use the process. If you don't convince people about the merits of a new process, they won't use it, worse they will sabotage it. Once the process catches momentum, it will spread quickly.Now, if you repeat this a thousand times with slightly different sentences, add a thousand ""tipping point"" phrases, a lot of tables and graphs of questionable use, voila, you have a book.It is a wonder to me how it got such a high rating."
4,Small wonder..,I got iSqueez few days ago and have been using it in my car. First of all it was little bit difficult to fit it in the cup holder but then I could squeez it. Next thing when I put the iPod in it the top of iPod constantly touches the differnt knobs on the front panel. I hope a smarter solution to this can be found. But overall iSqueez is a very useful product so far.
3,"OK, but has some problems with cables","If you are getting this to hold your iPod and you use the audio jack to run the sound to your car stereo, then approach with caution. The audio jack on my iPod nano is on the bottom and when a cable is plugged into the jack the iPod will not sit properly in the cradle. I give this 'three stars' for ease of use because of this hassle.If you use the doc connector, you may find that there is room in the cradle to accomodate the connector and cable.I got my cradle for 1 cent plus S&H; through one of the vendors on Amazon. I see it advertised for as much as $36, so be aware that there are lower cost options."
1,Cheap and Ineffective,I bought this an answer to where to put my ipod in the car and it was ineffective. It cracked easy and i was unable to plug in my aux cord with it in the holder.
5,Ipod holder,Not only does this thing hold the Ipod and stop the rattles but it is also great as a Cell Phone holder.
1,Forget it,The cradle seems well-designed until you find that the hole on the bottom is too small to fit the connector for a charger or FM transmitter. Don't need it - get an iPod case instead.
5,Love my foot massager,I love my new Osim ISqueeze Foot and Calf Massager! It is one of the first things I have purchased on Amazon.com and I am thrilled with the whole process. My vendor was excellent and I might even purchase another massager as a gift!
1,Doesn't work for the Nano,"On their website, Griffin Technologies says this will work with the iPod Nano, but it doesn't. The iSqueeze is too big for my cupholder, so it moves around. There's no place for the Nano to rest safely and snugly, so it tips over and falls out. This might work for other iPods, but do NOT get it for your Nano and expect it to work!"
3,Good product not universal,"Got the holder in a shop and it works better than having the ipod flying around the car at round abouts ..one warning as mentioned on another review it will not fit or with force in a pop up cup holder.. (Golf mark 4, very tight squeeze.. )"
5,Who is this Alex?,"okay whoever this Alex kid is, I can tell she doesn't like cats. I mean this kitten is not smoldering! Is it?! I think not!Okay Alex, You are a smoldering sludge ball that smells of a thousand horses butts! and you are an aliens eternal organs! hows that?! This kitten is a perfect unslimy gift."
1,NOT Extra Soft,"It's Scott Bath Tissue, but it's not extra soft! It has more of scratching feel. I only buy Scott Toilet Paper, so I thought I would try this version. I won't throw it away, so now we have to suffer through the whole case. Try another brand."
4,Capitalistic economies,"This is an excellent book for those who want to understand the corporation in modern society. Unless, you are a student of capitalism, you have no idea that without government restraint, societies will be eventually governed by fascism."
4,"its great mainly becos of ""cut the cake""","i first hoid awb's ""cut the cake"" in 1975 and i was s-o-l-d on the soul brothers .... this album has CTC's best trax and much more - earlier tracks - like pick up the pieces/person to person +++. If you're a soul brother - pick up this album BLINDFOLDED coz man (who cares that theyre actually scotsmen) AWB really GROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOVE !!!!"
3,He's done much better!,"I will begin by saying that I am a huge and probably biased fan of Robertson Davies. I am also a Canadian, which causes me to be even more so lenient to Davies. But, I have to say that in comparison to some of his later works, which I have read and greatly enjoyed, this book was lacking. There simply was no ending - the book just closes with a pathetic whimper as if the author had grown tired of writing it and moved on to other projects."
4,"A light weight Davies, but still a great book","Reading this book is like taking a trip with a mixed bag of characters: College students, college professors, ex-army vets, an opinionated gardener, teenagers, and many others. There is rarely a dull moment, there are many clever insights, and even though the trip doesn't finally leads us anywhere special, getting there is lots of fun. And there is Davies' attitude towards his characters: an amused curiosity, a gentle observation, so that the worst of them are still lovable human beings."
4,A sheer delight,"A brilliant, brutally honest, yet affectionate satire of the excentricities and insecurities present in old small-town Victorian-remnant Canadian Anglo-saxon culture...those of you among this set: you know who you are! Required reading for an Ontarian or a Maritimer born in the early 1940s, or for anyone who has ever known, loved, or worked closely with one. The story revolves around characters putting on an amateur production of Shakespeare's play ""The Tempest,"" and although I found the ending slightly anti-climactic, I really haven't laughed so hard in years!"
3,SLP Recording really ruins video quality !,Good video. Poor delivery.I was really annoyed by the fact that the video producers decided to shave pennies off of their costs by recoding in SLP (Super Long Play) mode.
5,"Looks very nice, and performs even better!","Plug and play at it's root.I just unplugged my old switch and plugged this in. Within seconds all the devices connected and those that were 1Gbit were detected as such.Transfer speeds went up from around 6-8 Megabytes / sec to around 30-35 Megabytes / sec. So quite a substantial jump in speed!One thing to note is that the blue lights on the device are quite bright and I had to put some tape on top of them because at night, my bedroom looked like a disco with all the blue lights blinking :)"
2,Great running head phones. Did not last long.,Bought these in July.Ran regularly in them as well as well as a few races during the summer (half marathon and 10K's).They just died on me. 4 months later.No audio coming out of them unless you apply pressure on the cable portion connecting to the ear buds.No fun.Comfortable. Long cord. Sound was okay. Not as strong as regular ipod headphones.
2,Packaging is deceptive,"The box containing these 'phones says, and I quote, ""Adjustable cord length."" The length is not adjustable. In fact, the cord is dead simple: a plug at one end and a pair of headphones at the other end.The sound quality is muddy. The construction looks quite flimsy to me.The good news: the headphones stay on my ears very nicely. The earhooks tilt and swivel to match the shape of your ears. They feel comfortable after hours of use, and won't make you look (very) silly in public."
1,You get what you pay for!,"After buying this product to replace the terrible ear buds that came with my iPod Nano, I was greatly disappointed. There is no bass, the ear pieces don't fit and the sound is tinny. If you are looking for an inexpensive headphones that gives you a great sound, THIS AIN'T IT!!!!"
2,Disappointed,"I am a runner and when I first purchased these ear phones, I was very happy with the overall sound quality and convenience of the over-the-ear clamps. That being said, after about a year of moderate running (three to four times a week), I have discovered that the wiring is faltering quickly and I often only get consistent sound in one ear bud while the other one skips in and out intermittently. I would not recommend these ear phones to others - especially for the price."
2,Poor Durability,"I am an avid runner and needed replacement headphones that delivered good sound quality and provide a snug but comfortable fit. Purchased these in June and initially was happy with the product. It met both those needs. However, what nobody mentioned in other reviews was the poor wire durability. The wires wore near the input plug after 4 months and now only receive intermittent sound in each headphone. I would not recommend these headphones for runners."
2,Nike HJ030 Vapor Sport Bud headphones,"Good fit and sound, the metal ear-pieces hold up well to sweat and moisture. Problems I encountered were 1.) inability to tighten the ear clips after about 3 months, 2.) the wiring at the plug-in jack became worn, producing intermittent sound after about 10 months. I like the product but would not recommend because of low durability."
3,Great except for cord wear,"Mine just went belly up because of wear on the cord near the plug in point. Otherwise, I really love these for running. No problem with sweat or coming loose. The cord is a big problem, however. I've had much headphones that were half the price last much longer. These held up less than a year. That said, I'm considering buying another pair and hoping for the best because comfort seems to be the hardest problem to solve with headphones and these were my favorite so far."
1,"Great sound, broke after 2 months",They sound great and fit nicely... for a little while. The hinge on one side got really loose after two months of running and soon after broke off.
1,Not a sports headphone,"Misleading box cover has a young athlete in motion with a sheen of sweat. Less than 1/2 lap on the track the buds are getting loose, and one falls out. Might be good for a power walk but nothing more energetic than that. Would give it 0 starts if I could."
2,same as everybody else,"sorry to repeat several others, but it just goes to show that Nike should stick to making shoes. its apparent that these earbuds were designed with the three-way movement in order to accommodate several ear sizes and shapes, but in the end it just leads to a mediocre initial fit, and after several weeks of running, a downright poor one. The hinges become loose, the earhook slides to a larger size and becomes unstable with any tugging on the wire, and there is minimal contact between the earbud and your ear, which also lends to instability. The only thing that kept me from giving them one star is that they surprisingly had descent sound. Its funny, but i'd actually compare them to stock ipod earbuds as far as sound quality goes. If anything, I expected the design to be great and the sound to be lacking - totally the other way around"
1,DO NOT BUY this,"Ok First i will state : DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM.Simply put this is the worst set of earbuds i have ever bought.Straight out of the box, it was showing signs of faulty wiring.I would go to plug them in, and the sound would distort, I would twist and twirl the plastic near the connector to get my sound to be balanced.I had these items for 1 day, i am returning them as soon as i can. Don't make the same mistake I did."
1,Same story,"Sorry to pile on here about the poor durability, but the only reason I'm even looking here is mine just broke. The design cannot be done properly with plastic and the screws also fall out and replacements cannot be found for either part. A major Nike disappointment. There ought to be a refund program on this product."
1,Doesn't last.,"I bought these headphones in March. It is now late May and the right earbud doesn't work. Even before that happened, I attempted to use it at the gym and while running outside, and it doesn't stay tight and secure on the ear. Sweat and moderate movement cause it to slip out of place. The ""claw"" as someone else referred to it is thus ineffective. In conclusion: waste of time and money."
2,Good product but defective from seller,"I've used this same brand and model of headphones for about a decade now, but I can say that the pair I bought from this seller arrived to me as a defective product. The wires were detached from the ear buds and I wasted about a month waiting for the headphones to come in."
2,"Extension wire doesn,t work","Earphones work but when you add the entension cord it stopsI need a new extension cord for the earphones. GivingG it some though I contacted philipe electronic I,m very impressed with you and them they atRe seninding me a new cord. Thank both of you for your great service"
2,Bad quality,I had a pair of these headphones for about two years. They finally stopped working so I bought another pair off amazon. Only three uses and one of the earphones doesn't consistently get sound. Very annoying to have the music go in and out of one ear!
1,Bad audio quality.,"The audio quality is terrible! Very honestly, these were worse than the ones apple gives out with their products. The sound is eardrum-killing-ly sharp . Just don't buy them!"
4,Some Wonderful Jazz,"Tony Scott was a true original. On recordings, I have heard him play swing, bop, plus some pioneering new age. He was one of the real pioneers of jazz clarinet. He is also playing baritone sax here,with the aid of Bill Evans, Paul Motian, Jimmy Knepper, and others. This is a very swinging post-bop two CD set. He recorded this before he left the country for some productive jamming and recording around the world. He died only a few months ago, in Italy I believe. His stuff isn't that easy to find, although Amazon.com has a nice collection. If you're a fan of, or would like to hear some Charlie Parker influenced clarinet played with a lot of freedom, plus some beautiful solos by the above mentioned soloists plus a few others, this is a very good place to listen."
3,"It's Okay, but Nothing Spectacular","I bought the video to get The Tokens singing The Lion Sleeps Tonight. Hank Ballard and the Midnighters sing Let's Go, Let's Go, Let's Go and Annie Had A Baby neither of which I cared for. Finger Poppin' Time would have been a much pizzazier choice. Frankie Lymon's brother and The Teenagers sing Why Do Fools Fall in Love, but it isn't the same without Frankie. Denise is a nice number by Randy & The Rainbows and Rama Lama Ding Dong by The Edsels. If you enjoy The Tokens singing The Lion Sleeps Tonight, buy the video and consider anything else that is included to be a bonus."
2,total cop-out,"my partner turned me on to nero wolfe. in general, i've always thoroughly enjoyed them (even though some might tend to test the suspension of disbelief thing a bit). leaving out any potential spoilers, the story started on a very gripping note. there was everything you could want from a mystery novel... and then fell incredibly, painfully flat. complete and total cop-out ending to what started out as a very promising story.it does give a little bit of background on wolfe though, and i suppose i'm glad to have read it for that aspect."
3,A Good Read but not incredibly full of information,"This book is an entertaining read and I certainly feel like I learned from it and will be a better dog trainer because of it. However I had expected to recieve a book that had less anecdotes and general ideas and more practical tips and instruction. I guess it alls comes down to what you're looking for; if you want to hear a story and pick up a few hints and ideas this is your book, if you want to take your dog out to the field and teach him to go hunting with you this book will help but there must be better ones out there."
1,Poor media,"I bought these on a whim for $7.99, and have had nothing but problems, better than 50% FAILURE Rate. Those that did burn had defects like heavy noise in the recordings, unable to read, etc. I verified it was the media by burning same project with phillips media and had no prblems. The small cost didn't make it worhtwhile to return, so I ate the cost and tossed them out!"
1,Don't waste your time,"The scenes were so dark that half the time I couldn't make out what was happening. Like David O Selznick said during his production of his best hit, GONE WITH THE WIND, if effects photography makes the shot look so dark that you can't tell what's going on in the picture, forget the artistry and turn the lights on. The story was a sad confused jumble and I wouldn't sit through it again."
3,Watch this for lead actor Cushing,Great acting. Cushing and Dickey are incredibly amazing actors. I loved this film. Reminds me of Kubrick with the definitive mood and existential view that is relatively uncommon. I would highly recommend it!!
4,The Yellow Wallpaper,"So far I have only seen this movie 12 times in the pass two weeks. I may be 56 years old but I love a great horrorstory. My favorite part be the ending. I'm still not quite sure about the ending, I was very surprised at the ending, I had no ideal. If you like being being kept of the edge and you also like a love story, this is it. I brought the bookand dvd."
1,a terribly unfaithful rendition,"As an English teacher who uses this story to show development of character in a Creative Writing class, I was horrified by the unfaithful rendition of this movie to the actual story. There is absolutely no way that I would ever show this movie to my classes as I had planned."
3,BrianKate's Review,"This is a very good book for gay/lesbian people who want to see some positive messages on the subject of religion, which is definitely needed. With all the hatred that masquerades as ""God's word"" when it comes to homosexuality (even though Jesus himself *never* mentions sexuality or gender identity *at all*, it's about time people started putting loving book which shows gay/lesbian people they don't have to abandon religion. My only complaint is that the authors don't ever mention or include bisexual or transgendered people at all. They just quickly say something to the effect of ""we'd like to, but that's beyond the scope of our book."" I'd say someone should write another book addressing this, since bi and trans people get the same harassment from so-called ""religious"" people, but except for that, this is a very good book. I'd recommend it to any gay/lesbian people I know who don't want to give up on religion, since it shows you *can* be gay *and* a Christian."
2,"Listless, mushy, pompous -- what's to like?","Daniel Barenboim is welcome before all the world's great orchestras, but that doesn't guarantee world-class music-making. This Rite of Spring from Paris is decidedly listless, and since the orchestra isn't necessarily top notch, one notices some strain in the playing, particularly with the brass section. Maybe that's why the engineers placed them as far back as next week, so that we wouldn't notice. Barenbim's rhythms are mushy or ""romantic,"" if you like this style better than I do. The accompanying Sym. of Psalms is very well sung and recorded, yet the conductor tries to soup it up with religiosity, just the thing this great modernist work doesn't need."
5,Funstuff Bible,Easy stories for 3-5 graders to understand. And for younger children also. It has nice pictures also.
1,BUY ALUMINUM FOIL INSTEAD,"I bought this to try and improvise a way to keep my plants warm and cozy this winter. This ""blanket"" is so fragile it would rip with normal usage. Not worth the price. Buy a roll of aluminum foil for better strength and warmth.I feel like an idiot owning this cheap worthless thing.I'm giving it a 1 star because I can't give it zero stars."
5,Nice and compact,"Great size for what it is, Perfect for a first aid kit or other emergency supplies. buy a few just in case"
4,the pic is deceiving,"in the picture it shows two but i only got one, when it was delivered i saw only one so i got online and look at the pic, they changed it so it shows one, but now its back to showing two... very deceiving indeed, but i do love it and it makes a fine addition to my kit"
1,Brazilian VOODOO????,"To all the reviewers writing about Brazilian ""voodoo"". The word does not exist in the Afro-Brazilian vernacular because it is a Francophile bastardization from Haiti, not of Brazilian candombl?.I especially appreciate the comment from ""RioRick"" regarding his having witnessed these ceremonies ""often at knifepoint""... Give me a break. It is this kind of ignorance that perpetuates the Hollywood fascination with African-derived religions often deemed as ""occult"" or ""black magic"".I am not surprised that all of these reviwers actually enjoyed this book, giving that it probably feeds their imagination for blood-lusting rituals ""that can get out of control"".You fools..."
2,Great pictures but...,"Unfortunatly the elaborate descriptions and lack of reference to photo's make it difficult to ""see"" what the author talks about. The pictures in this are all very nice and most importantly I did learn. Thanks"
4,Sturdy and colorful,"I don't know how educational this set is, but toddlers all love to play with sand and these serve their purpose.They're made of sturdy and colorful plastic, but don't know if they're made in China and if the plastic is dangerous. I should probably check on that today.The toys don't all fit in the bucket.I saw a kid the other day with the wheel toy that had TWO wheels. I think that is cooler than this one, which is one wheel."
3,its okay,"I liked everything about this set except for the sand spinner thing. I didnt spin!! Whenever we pourd sand into the spout, it would just sit there. Thats no fun! But everything else worked well and help my son have fun in the sand."
5,Great Set,"My baby loves this set, however I wish it had a sifter. I ended up buying this set and another that had a sand sifter. This set was definitely better quality than any other set I've seen."
5,Sturdy!,"I bought this for my 4 year old last year and she had a lot of fun playing in the dirt and sand. The pieces are very durable, not like the cheap sand toys. They have lasted outside through the Winter, yes, they were unfortunately left out in the snow. The color is faded but like the energizer bunny, they are holding up and she enjoyed another Summer with them!"
5,Lofty and Wendy Awesome Fun,Lofty and Wendy by BRIO are awesome fun for my son and all his friends. It provides hours of educational fun and promotes the idea that work can be fun. Teamwork is also promoted with this and other Bob the Builder Toys.
1,Waste of Money,"I don't know who rated this a good book, Or maybe I just don't get it. It really is not a book I could get into. Actually, I didn't understand any of it. What is it really about?? Maybe I can sell it back for 10 cents."
1,"Hideous, trite, way too ""new age""","MY impression was Duerk was emerging from a very hectic and chaotic time in her life and wanted someplace to rest. The words ""quiet"" and ""peaceful"" are on every single page at least three times I think. And yeah absolutely I need my QUIET and my still times in life. But the idea of bowing down to the ""peaceful goddess"" is a crock. The Goddess was a pretty angry, bloody deity. Blood is all over her origin(menstruation), and her existence to reflect the predatorial nature of human lives at the time. Don't make MY GODDESS into some demur, quiet, hide in the dark silent corner of the cave deity! She was loud, powerful, scary as hell, with a lions head in Eqypt and snakes on her head in Greece, with serpents in her hands in India."
3,The parts are good but the whole doesn't cohere,"A movie that should have been better. The parts are just fine, but the whole never brings the parts together to lift it to any more than an average movie."
3,"Included Tip Card is laughable, Peek and Pop is lame","I have a 11 month child. She enjoys playing with the rings. It is basically a colorful ring stack - nothing more. For $6.95 - don't expect any lobe developement here (except maybe ear lobe.) Tip card says ""play peek a boo and say colors out loud to your child"" Oh please. No batteries nor sound."
4,Detailed DDx,"This is a very detailed book. It is dry and moderately difficult reading, but is comprehensive in its subject matter. THis is not a book that I would read cover to cover and study from. It is more of a reference text. In fact, I refer to it nearly every day and do not predict that it will become outdated."
3,Upper GI Surgery by Fielding,The book was not as comprehensive as I expected. It did cover all the upper GI disorders but each chapter was too concise. I believe it can only function as a supplementary reading and not as a solid reference for general surgeons.
4,Wyatt who?,"This is a very good primer for those interested in Commodore Perry Owens and the Gunfight at Blevins' Cottage. Will Barnes claimed he witnessed the gunfight between Owens and the Blevins brothers, but he was not called on to testify at any of the subsequent coroner's inquests. More likely, Barnes distilled his manuscript from the eyewitness accounts of others who were there on that September afternoon in 1887. Still, the story is factual and fairly accurate. Of special interest to historians are Appendix A, the story of the gunfight as it appeared in The Apache County Critic and Appendix B, the Coroner's Inquest interviews. Neil Carmony's editing is quite good. Recommended reading."
3,Clear but Dry,"While this text does provide a reasonably clear and accessible introduction to the constructionist perspective, it is very dry. Loseke also tends to get repetitive. I never would have finished this book if it hadn't been required for a class. It could have been a lot shorter and needed something more to make it interesting and engaging."
3,Three Stars for Beautiful Book,"Obviously a wonderful collection of images with historical and insightful text accompanying. Nonetheless, as a photographer, I was moderately disappointed with the manner in which the images were presented. The images are all presented in a sepia tone which I doubt is true for all of the originals. More concerning, however, is that most of the images lack the sharpness and fine detail which was undoubtedly present in many of the originals. While one reviewer compliments the ""soft focus"" techniques, I have seen several of the images before in very sharp focus with fabulous detail. To soften any of the images for publication for any reason betrays the brilliance which Alfred Cheney Johnston displayed in creating the images. It is still a wonderful collection."
5,Beautiful,"They just don't make 'em like they used to. So many beauties, all beautiful for different reasons."
3,Photo quality not great but interesting to look at.,Don't expect to be knocked over by the high quality of the photos in this book. They certainly do not match up to Albert Arthur Allen's quality work. But still a nice book to own. It a bit much in cost but thats made up in the weight of the book. Pound for pound its heavier than most books.
5,beautiful and infomative coffee book of a phenomenal photographer!,"I also bought this book for the photos and to learn about the Ziegfeld girls. I was really impressed about the variety of subjects that Mr. Johnston photographed.The text was illuminating and really ""fleshed out"" the subjects of Mr. ACJ's photos. It left me wanting more and now I want to learn more about this underappreciated man and his work.Buy this book if you are into the history of Ziegfeld girls, 1920's fashion photography, or interested in an amazing photographer.I, too, wish the book was a bit larger so the pictures could be really appreciated.A must have!"
4,"Phenomenal, just needs to be in a larger format...","This is a spectacular book in every respect but one - it's size. The photos are fantastic, the layout is fantastic, the quality of its production is top drawer, everything about it is classy and well refined, but it's a downright unusual size for a book of this type, and that's why I only give it four stars.This needed to be in a large format to fully appreciate the photos and the beautiful layout work, but instead, it's sized about the same as most hardback novels, and when you place four photos on a page of that size, the images tend to be very small and you lose the overall impact of those photos.I highly recommend this one, get the hardback while you can before being forced into a reprint paperback, but I would've prefered the book be a sized more in keeping with most art and photography books."
5,Breathtakingly beautiful!,"This book is so amazing! The 1920s is absolutely my favorite era and to see all of these gorgeous photos of these gorgeous 20s women is just incredibly delightful. Even if you don't recognize some of the names in here, you'll appreciate the art of the pictures. And, you do get to see rare pictures of stars like Clara Bow and Louise Brooks."
1,Horrible service + no product!?,"First off, I don't write reviews. This company just happens to be so f'n bad they needed one. The company is based in uk so the books may take 5-8 days to receive, which is understandable. My book still hasn't arrived and it's been over a month. The customer service department never informed me of what was going on until I pursued them. They said they ordered another and it would be up to 14 days before they got the book from their supplier. So I waited patiently and 15 days later still no word. These guys are a sham and are truly absurd when it comes to customer service. They constantly wanted to give me the refund so I would get out of their hair but to me thats hardly the easy way out. I would not recommend these guys. I'd be surprised if they stayed in business. Buy your books somewhere else please!"
5,Good Adventure Story,"Excellent read - fast paced, offbeat Western. Jack Ketchum consistently turns out these types of action/thrillers that are pure escapism - don't look for any messages, just great reading enjoyment."
2,Where's Da Doo Ron Ron by the Crystals on this DVD,"I agree with the reviewer complaining about Jay and the Americans. I have another beef: I own the VHS version which has the Crystals ""Da Doo Ron Ron"" on it for a total of 35 cuts. It happens to be a favorite of mine. I bought the DVD on Dec 31, 2006, but it only has 34 cuts and does not list Da Doo Ron Ron on the back jacket. My neighbor has the same problem. PBS can't explain it, and, everyone selling it, including Amazon, still advertises it as being on the DVD. Can somebody tell me what's going on?Fred Hanke, Monrovia CA"
4,good show,"this show was good. had some good artists in it. at times the audio was a bit fuzzy, but otherwise it was OK. I could tell there was some changes in the artists, but still close."
4,Next best thing to being there,"Thoroughly enjoyed this DVD. I also enjoyed Vol. 1, but I thought this was even better. There weren't filler groups as in the 1st one that sang the songs but really the originals. The only thing that kept this from a 5 is that there were some groups (at least 1) that I truly don't think were any originals. Great trip down memory lane!"
5,One of the BEST Thelwell Books Ever!,"Especially in this day and age where selling a house seems - and sometimes is - virtually impossible, `This Desirable Plot', despite being written decades ago, is a fantastically funny and relevant book that anyone who's ever tried to buy or sell a home will love! Even if you have no home buying or renting experience, the outrageous - but surprisingly believable - situations will make you laugh out loud! Home buyers, sellers, and renters will find the situations eerily familiar, in the most laughable way! `This Desirable Plot' covers everything: agent lingo, owner lingo, buyer tactics (`no, you can't swing a cat in here!'), horror stories of home inspection, and more! Of course all the jokes are told with stellar wording and drawing! The plot may not be as desirable as they'd like you to think, but this is certainly a very desirable book!"
5,This book helped me understand all of it!,"Excel 2000 has a ton of features, none of which I thought I would ever find. This book let me dig in at any level. I am only partially through it and have already learned so much."
4,Modern Guide to Fingerings for the Flute,"The first thing you need to know about this fingering guide is that it is for the open hole, or french style flute, with a B foot. This guide is not for closed hole flutes, or flutes with a C foot. Though some of the fingerings will work for the C foot and closed-hole student flute, the strength of this book is its comprehensive treatment of the professional, open-hole, B foot instrument. If you have such an instrument, I recommend this book for its detailed discussion of many alternative fingerings and its treatment of the microtonal and multiphonic resources of the instrument. If you have a closed-hole flute you will be disappointed."
5,This is the one to buy...........,"Decent quality steel case.Mechanical timer.I had the Hampton Bay 300 watt model....DO NOT BUY HAMPTON BAY TRANSFORMERS. CUSTOMER SERVICE IS VERY BAD AND THERE IS NOT EVEN ANY WARRANTY OR CUSTOMER SERVICE INFO IN WITH THE PRODUCT, as I found out when it broke and going to Home Depot for help was a joke. Anyway, I am happy so far with the Malibu and it seems that it has a bigger transformer than the Hampton and the overall construction is better. Just to convince you of how bad the Hampton Bay customer service is try doing a search for them online, you'll see."
3,Replacement,"This transformer was an identical replacement for one that the timer went out on. Intermatic wouldn't sell just the timer. (a simple fix) So I was forced to spend $60 instead of $3 or $4. What a waste. There must have been 2 or 3 pounds of copper that just went out in the trash. I should have bought a different brand out of spite, but this was the best deal. Glad I found it on Amazon. Much cheaper than retail from the big box stores."
3,Quality Control?,"Received unit and noticed that some metal parts were loose and rattling around inside. Installed the unit and it worked for two days, then failed. Amazon sent replacement promptly and I returned the defective unit. The replacement also has several parts loose and rattling around inside. Installed and it has worked for the past four days. If it lasts, then this unit is a good value. Wonder if anyone also received units with loose metal parts inside. May have been a batch with quality control issues.PS: The replacement transformer also failed after one week. Returned for refund."
4,Malibu 300W Low Voltage Transformer,"Worked as advertised...other reviewers commented on lack of template for mounting, but I found no difficulty. I pulled all the timer pins out and use a photocell switch in series with the unit to turn in on at dusk and let it run for four hours.There is a slight buzz (60 cycle noise), but I was able to isolate the box from the wall with some rubber pads and it is tolerable. Only has 12 volt taps, so you have to have relatively short runs to ensure the last fixture has adequate voltage. I used 12 gage wire exclusively with this unit and am currently running eight fixtures with 170 watts total.Satisfied so far."
1,Never Worked,This product never worked as advertised. The timer never came on and the lights came on and off every minute. It just burned out today.
5,Fixed the problem,"I had too many lights too far away from my primary transformer. I cut the line and put this in line, the lights were brighter again! Works great!"
4,transformer timer,"I had a 120 watt timer, only with 180 watts of lights on the system and overloading the transformer. So I purchased this 300 watt time and it works great."
5,Great Low Voltage Timer,"I already owned one of these low voltage timers. After reading really bad reviews about many other brands, I searched Amazon and found the same model that I already had. Keeps accurate time and all of my low voltage lighting works great with this product."
1,This thing sucks,"Six months after I bought it the timer isn't strong enough to flip the power switch, so now it's completely useless. I had one on the house I bought last year and replaced it for the same reason, but I thought it was over 10 years old. Now I know they fail within months. Crappy POS product."
1,Made a mistake,"Both my transformers went bad at the same time, due to a power surge - according to Malibu. I thought this would be a good alternative and cost less than buying two smaller transformers.This power pack is very noisy when it turns on, which one could overlook, if it did the job for which I bought it. It works fine with ONE set of six lights, but as soon as I connected the other string of six, only the very first light was bright, and the others were orange, and the second set would not give off any light at all. A BIG MISTAKE. It's unfortunate that we don't have more brands to choose from."
3,Works fine but the hum is too loud for me.,I don't know if I received a defective unit or not but this unit makes what I would consider a pretty loud humming noise when on. I ended up returning it for this reason.
5,intermatic malibu 300 watt timer,nice! handles more than enough lights. Is working excellent and looks handsom too.
3,Good but not great!,"This transformer is well made but lacks sophistication.It is extremely heavy and uses an antiquated pin system to turn the lights on and off.The pins are small and can be easily lost making the unit unusable. The pins need to be adjusted constantly as the seasons change with longer or shorter daylight. Why no automatic light sensor to adjust to seasonal change?Who wants to constantly adjust these tiny pins all the time,not me.I understand that sensors can be added but thats a pain why not build it into the product or include it??"
1,Dead 1 Year Later,"Purchased on 5/25/2009, then nearly to the day 1 year later, the lights did not come on. The box was always off the ground sitting on a stump. I could hear it humming, so it had power, but the bottom plastic around the ground screw area was fried. When I wiggled it, that section fell into the transformer and I can't open the box to even take a look. An expensive heavy black brick in the trash - that still receives the power, but won't put any out (I tried a new wire and a brand new light to make sure). I don't know if a big spider was able to short it out since I've seen them drive my electric fence nuts, but this was a big bummer and I am having a hard time figuring out if I should order it again or the new model that's more money... for what... and will take much longer to arrive. I just extended the garden, bought more lights to add to the mere 7 I was running on that heavy wire and now, no juice... grrr."
3,Notable Families,"If you are interested in the family backgrounds of a number of our U. S. Presidents, as you peruse the family trees as provided in DeBrett's Peerage, you can pick up some nice tidbits here about the family of Zachary Taylor and related lineages."
3,Regreso?,"Sorprendido por lo que se acerca cada vez más a Héroes, en cuento a estilo, claro que guardando siempre las distancias, pues nada se compara a lo que hacia con ellos. Un disco para tener en cuenta."
4,Look good.,Perfect fit to goldwing.But need little modified. Sound quality is great on high and low frequency band.OEM speaker is weak.
5,Great Price,I'm pleased with the purchase. Very easy to assemble. The only negative is it doesn't automatically turn on at dusk (The unit doesn't have a dusk to dawn light sensor). We had to use a separate light sensor with the unit.
3,nice lights,"lights are pretty gud sturdy lil hard to put together lil time cunsuming digging to put the lines down but once set are really good to look at .the lights come on the exact time u set them, the shipping was perfect less than a week on standard shipping oh yeah all the lights were workn but one lights are easy to get at wallmart for cheap lights ,some can just barely tap the light and a piece will fly off but u can easly snap it back on"
1,Parts missing,I have been trying to fax the proof of purchase every day for a month and I can't get through. So they sent me a email dismissing my claim to get the missing parts. My husband is recovering from back surgery and this has been a real pain for me.
4,Malibu outdoor lighting kit,"The lights are great...but the 88 watt power packs, they seem to be having problems with. Amazon was great to work with and they replaced the 2 power packs that did not work. I hope they did not lose money as it should be the Malibu company quality control testing the packs and making them better. If they leave the factory not working that does not say much for the quality of the packs."
1,Light at the end of the tunnel... or so I thought!,This is the worst $50 I've spent on something! Bad investment! The light that it gives is so weak it won't even decently light up my pathways. It should be very very dark for these lights to work. You need all 46 floodlights to light up a tree! My solar lights outperformed it by ten-fold! Bad decision!
1,Missing parts!,"The first order arrived & we were very excited-until we found that an integral part was missing. We returned the set, had a new one sent. SAME THING, SAME MISSING PART! Had to make 2 trips to the post office & still have no lights!"
1,Parts Missing AND Parts Broken,"Haven't even plugged the lights in yet, but I started the assembly of each light (which isn't easy for someone with big fingers and little patience). Some assembly required is an understatement with this kit.We're missing small parts for all of the spotlights and some of the wire ends are stripped off, so before I've even started wiring the lights outside, we've already lost 7 lights. Makes the full kit worth that much less.I'll update my review after finishing the installation. So far its a 1 star product..."
2,outdoor lights,I am not all that happy with the Malibu outdoor lights. They are very thin plastic and break easily.I would look for something more durable if I were going to purchase lights again.I guess you get what you pay for.
2,Bulbs,Have not been able to install or use the outdoor lighting. Arrived without bulds or information to purchase.
1,NO LIGHT,"WHOEVER PACKED THE MALIBU BOX OUTDOOR LIGHT SET, FORGET SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT...THE ""BULBS"" WHEN YOU SEND ME THE BULBS FOR LX19720T, I'LL BE ABLE TOINSTALL IT."
1,"3 kits, zero bulbs","We bought this for our lawn, but sadly when it arrived, we noticed that there were no lightbulbs though there should have been. We contacted Amazon and they sent out a second kit. No bulbs. We contacted Amazon a last time to inform them about it and they sent out a third kit. No bulbs. Amazon took all the kits back at no charge for shipping and refunded our purchase. I can't believe Intermatic/Malibu would have 3 kits in a row with no bulbs. Yay Amazon though."
2,miss items,I had purchased this produce before with no problems or complains. On opening this product purchase it was missing all the light bulbs and sockets. I requested an exchange and was informed product out of stock. Very disappointed. Have send product back to amazazon.com. Will think hard about making a purchase with them again. Was quite an inconvinience to return and wasted alot of time and still have no lights.
5,Capuchin,"These are great. Not expensive, easy to install, and they work great. My kit was complete; nothing missing or broken. I've had many compliments. We get some snow, but not lots; they work fine. Given the price, these are well worth it."
4,SHORT CHANGED,"JUST SOME THINGS TO MENTION. 1. I was told this item was back ordered 6-8 weeks. It arrivied in two weeks via US Postal Service. 2. I felt short changed because this lighting kit came with a 100 feet of 18 gauge wire, instead of the standard 12 gauge sold at your local box stores ie...Lowes,Home Depot. 3. If I had known I was getting a lower grade wire I wouldn't have ordered this lighting kit. You will not find this information(wire gauge) on the amazon item description page or on the merchandise box. 4. I'm still planning on installing these lights because I've had excellent results over the years with this same product but, I've always used the 12 gauge wire."
3,"Missing pieces, but still working after 2 years","When I first received, the kit was missing all the socket connectors that actually held the bulbs- kinda need those. At the time, the company had recently changed ownership, so it was a bit of a challenge to finally get ahold of someone to help. Once I finally did- they shipped the missing pieces with very little trouble and they work. Cheap, fragile,- but I got what I paid for."
4,"Not the best, not the easiest but good value for their money","I decided after 1 1/2 years that solar powered lights are not all they are cracked up to be. Trying several different models they all offer little light, the batteries die....So I found these lights and decided to give them a try. Good news, they are very bright and once the lights are assembled they are easy to install outdoors. I can't say I care for assembling each light fixture however. That alone took me several hours and while not technically challenging, required fingers smaller than my own.Still they are working quite well and I think I'll order another kit for the other half of the yard."
2,Poor customer service,"Our shipment was missing some parts upon delivery. I called customer service and it was not easy getting the replacements. Much paperwork involved. Finally, almost a month later, I received them but they were sent to the wrong address and had to be forwarded here. They were told specifically where to send them. If I would have bought this at Home Depot, I would have taken the box back and gotten an immediate replacement."
3,Broken and missing parts/ have not installed yet,"Broken and missing parts. Have not been able to use as I am still wait for Malibu to send me the replacement parts. Also Malibu was not real helpful in the solution of this problem. They have a web site for this, but it is convoluted and not real user friendly. They obviuosly have a real problem with this, having the web site with hundreds of items for replacement of broken and missing parts."
2,I'm sorry that I have to disagree...,"Although I purchased this cookbook with great expectations, I have been very disappointed. It is very well organized and wonderful pictures, which have been the problem for me because they are so tempting. I've made 5 recipes from the fish section and I've been disappointed with each one. I live on the Atlantic seaboard and have access to and purchase only the freshest fish, so I don't think it is the quality of ingredients. Although the dishes come out as pictured, they just don't have a lot of flavor. I'm going to give it one more try this weekend with the Pinot Noir sauce, but I'm not optimistic. I am going to D.C. in January, however, and I hope to be able to dine at the restaurant. For a great seafood cookbook, try Le Bernardin. I've prepared 14 of the dishes and I've been very pleased with each one."
1,Bob the Builder toy set,I think this 'little' set is extremely overpriced for the size of the toy. The picture is deceiving. It is more in line with a stocking stuffer rather than a main gift as I had intended. I will most likely return the item.
1,Not worth the money.,"I cannot believe this product is worth ($...).Fisher-Price offers a much better value. For all the""hipe"" about Bob the Builder I expected something interesting.My four year old son took one look at this and put it in histoy box and it hasn't been seen since."
4,really makes you think,"the movie is based on a Spanish movie, that is like a strange dream. It really makes you think. not a typical Tom Cruise movie. It's ok."
5,"Excellent, Important Book that Everyone Should Read","This book is well written, informative and an enjoyable read. But so are many books. What distinguishes this one is that it also presents a critical message - one that we all should take to heart. And do not assume: ""oh, wonderful, here's another book just bemoaning the fate of the planet and predicting its destruction."" Instead, Dr. Pimm's book does an exceptional job of clearly and accurately presenting a wealth of sobering information while maintaining a strong sense of optimism and inspiration. This is a truly outstanding and important book, and one does not need to be a scientist to understand and appreciate its content."
2,Great title wrong book,"An audit of the Earth sounded like the kind of book you would read to gain an overall view of the present state of the environment. This book subtitled, ""A Scientist Audits the Earth "", sounded like the charm. I would generalize by saying Pimm's audit of the earth contains much of the ""same old same old "" and a lot of subjectivity. Factual information is hard to come by. In this book it requires over 100 pages to explain the process of estimating the amount of arable land available for crops. His explanation of his travels are interesting, but is this audit material ?For a real audit of the environment I recommend The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World by Bjorn Lomborg. Lomborg's is a statistician and this book I feel really performed a audit of the environment. Stuart Pimm's book, The World According to Pimm pales in comparison to the factual information presented in Lomborg's book."
5,Works great!,"I've been using this product with the Mega Blondes 30 volume cream developer for years and love it! I've never experienced the burning scalp that other reviewers claim to have had, though the night after I color, I do have itchy scalp when I lay down to sleep. I leave on for 30 minutes."
1,Burned my scalp,"I bought the Natural Blond L'Oreal Mega Blonde at Sally's Beauty Supply and mixed it as directed with the 30 vol L'Oreal Mega Blonde developer. It burned my scalp within 5 minutes and left blisters that took a week to heal. I don't know who could possibly leave this on their head for the directed 45 minutes. If I had done so, I'm sure I would have had visible skull. The stuff smells TERRIBLE before you even add the developer.I am not a novice colorist. I was licensed for years, but changed careers to get off of my feet. I have colored my naturally brown hair every shade between platinum blond and jet black over the past 20 years using a myriad of brands and formulas, but I have NEVER smelled or felt anything like this horrible product. This was THE WORST hair coloring experience I have ever had."
1,Mega Blondes mega sucks,"I know everyone is different, but I've been bleaching/coloring my hair for years, usually at the salon. I wanted to save some money so bought the mega blondes in lightest ivory. My mom applied it for me, she's a hairdresser. First of all, it smelled SO awful. It was runny runny runny, and burned my scalp like I've never been burned before. I am usually pretty tough but was feeling a lot of pain but decided to just let it hurt and leave it on for 45 minutes. It did lighten my hair pretty well but just was not worth the smell and burns. My scalp had blisters all over it and took a week to heal. I started going back to my hairdresser and told her about it, she flipped out saying I'm lucky I have hair after all that. So yeah, never again will I ever purchase this."
3,Tascam DP-02 DVD,"Overall, I'd recommend this DVD because I found it infinitely more helpful than the ""instruction manual"" that comes with the recorder. I've done some in-home recording using analog gear, so that helped me get started with the DP-02, but I found the instruction manual less than adequate when it came to expanding my skills. The DVD proved to be helpful by providing information I'll be able to incorporate in my future recordings. Some of the descriptions and demonstrations of the functions the recorder is capable of are pretty darn quick, but I guess that's why the remote comes with ""rewind."" All-in-all, the DVD is worth the price because now I have a helpful reference as I work expand my ability to use the capabilities of the DP-02."
4,A must!,"I would not have made it to first base without the tutorial. Sometimes you will feel he is not explaining the whole process- but he is actually covering topics in the order of the manual. Do what he does; NOT what you want to do! And it will all come together.Songwriters can often have a challenge recording vocals and the instrument at separate times. I wish he had shown a bit more real life (me) kind of stuff. When you record guitar and vocals at the same time- panning, for example, is an issue. Tip: It's not as simple as left and right; because some guitar is on the vocal and some vocal may be on the guitar- you might need to pan both to the left-ish side to find the middle with your hearing! Let the Force be your guide. . .I started from scratch, technologically cursed and am having some success. I see the light at the end of the tunnel thanks to this tutorial."
2,Barely better than the manual,The goofball in the video must like the sound of his own voice. His instructions are somewhat limited as he will perform a function without telling you what button he is pressing and the video shot of the Tascam doesn't show the whole unit so at times you are left wondering which button did he press.
3,Pretty cool,I have to admit I am a sucker for mad cap comedy and this movie hits it. Don't expect big budget special effects just good comedic banter....and some nudity...always helps. Hitinface
3,Worth the money,"I used this book to help prepare for the MS certification exam. It has the expected number of mistakes, nothing major to worry about. Some areas of this book run too basic for my taste, others made me sit up and pay attention. The review questions were way easy and the CD is a joke, but all in all a useful reference, worth the money. Ray-man MCSE"
4,"Started hilarious, ended movingly.","This video set is not what I expected. The episodes started out extremely funny, then became mixed funny and ""cringey"" (with many situations where you found yourself peeking out at the TV from behind spread fingers or over the edge of a blanket). Then came a stage where things got so dark I thought about giving up on the series. Finally, with the season finale came a redemption of sorts, tying the whole up together and leaving me very happy that I watched the whole thing. My wife, my son, and I watched the series together (it was a Father's Day present) and agreed that in the end, taken as a whole, the series was very good. The series was also a lot deeper than I expected, and showed a side of Ricky Gervais that I had not seen to date. He's not only funny, but a very good writer and actor."
1,Extras The complete series,"In the second series,one the DVD's was labled as ""disc 2"" but had the same information as "" disc 1"".Season 2, is missing disc 2."
5,Must own.,"Forget those people that are whining about HBO Video. The bottom line is, the smart people have waited for this complete set to be released before buying any season of Extras!The writing is spot on. Gervais and Merchant are the modern day Laurel and Hardy on screen. Comedy fans must own this set."
2,Where is the second DVD????,I am a big fan of Extras and was delighted that it was available as a full set. I was disappointed to find that there was only one DVD in the first season set. Although the insert described the contents of each of the TWO DVD's there was only the first. There was not even a place in the case for a second DVD. I already had the first season (both DVD's) so I never bothered to try to send it back but was amazed at the lack of quality control.
2,I don't advise ordering this.,"This was too depressing to be a good comedy and yet had just enough humor to prevent it from ever being a greek tragedy. I have seen RG in other things and have enjoyed his performances greatly. This, however, will never be viewed again by me."
5,Only downer is too few episodes.,"Of course fans of ""The Office"" would naturally gravitate to Gervais's humor in ""Extras"". But fans of ""The Larry Sanders Show"" by Gary Shandling would also find much to laugh at here. Similarites abound... a comedy sans laugh track with celebrities portraying obnoxious versions of themselves."
5,LOVE this series!!,"In my opinion even funnier then The Office! Guest stars are so funny, and Ricky is even better as Andy then the office boss. The character of Maggie is such a great counterpart for him as well.The box set doesn't bother me, as I hadn't bought any before, so I thought it was a great price!The only thing that surprised me was how serious the special was in comparison to the rest of the series. Almost became a drama - and I would have liked to have had something a little more positive happen to Maggie. Still nice well rounded series, very funny, and VERY highly recommended!!"
4,Defective Disk Spoils Awesome Finale,"The Series Finale Disk, although printed up to look like the Extras Finale, turned out to be disk 2 of Planet Earth. Again, the disk was printed and labelled so that it looked an Extras disk--we only discovered the truth when we finally got around to watching it. Unfortunately, we did not get around to watching the final disk until months after I'd bought the set, as I'd already seen the whole series on TV. Be sure to watch all the disks as soon as they arrive, to make sure they contain the content they're supposed to. I know the show is great or I wouldn't have bought it on DVD; but quality assurance for this line seems to suck."
5,"A question, not a review","Does this have subtitles (not closed captions), at least in english? I'd like to know before I buy it.Hope someone answers me, please, pleeease!"
4,great buy and funny as hell,"Extras is an amazing show and needed one more season, but for what you get it's amazing and genius and sometimes uncomfortable to watch."
5,Top Quality!,Even if you don't like Ricky Gervais (how's that possible I ask?) you will love this brilliant series. Every single episode offers A-list stars poking fun at themselves and their profession in the film/tv industry. This series will have you doubled over in laughter. Gervais's style of cringe worthy moments come thick and fast whilst he takes you on the journey of lowly extra to proper famous star and all the way back down again.
5,Extras: The Complete Series,This was an awesome series! Andy Gervais' sense of humor is second to none and his briliance shines through in this work. The guest stars were very appropriately chosen and also added the right touch to make this series truly a materpiece in my eyes!!!
2,Vintage I guess!,Extremely old cassette self destructed almost immediately! I am not sure I played the whole tape before it died! A GREAT ALBUM!
2,Too academic,This was too academic for my purposes. Was looking for something to help me understand the book of JOB better to teach a Sunday school lesson.
5,My favorite book in seminary,"I had the pleasure of having Gerry as a professor in seminary for a course on Job. It was by far my favorite course of all time. Gerry is a true scholar open to multiple meanings of a text arrived at through the study of other disciplines. He makes this wonderful book of the Bible come alive, grounds it in a historical and theological context while in dialogue with other scholars and their interpretation of the text. I had the pleasure of teaching a class on Job that lasted several months and I used this book. The students wanted to continue for a year because they saw the relevance to their lives but they also felt stretched to see the world in a more open way through the depth of human emotional experience vis-a-vis God. My only worry is that my copy of this book will fall apart. By that time, however, I should have memorized much of it."

1,Electromagnetic Cat Door,"I will never purchase this pet door again. In fact, I am online tonight, looking for another brand of electromagnetic pet door. My cat has broken three of this BRAND; she's been able to pry open the lower part that houses the battery. In doing so, she's broken the wiring. Also, the 4-way locking knob sticks out. She's been able to paw at it, dislodging it. I notice the Staywell brand knob is more sunken and the battery compartment is not separate."
2,Factual errors,"I was actually a ""contributor"" on this book, and I am ""quoted"" in the book. However, much of the information about me and my unit in this book is not accurate. I would recommend not taking anything in this book as ""factual"" unless verified elsewhere."
3,No mention of the 334th AHC?,"No mention of the 334th AHC? I transfered from B Btry 2/20th ARA to the 344th Armed Helicopter Company after Lamson 719 in April 71. There were three platoons at the time; the Playboys, the Sabres and the Raiders, the Gangbusters having been deactivated some time before. The Company motto was ""First with Guns"" and they were the first unit to get Cobras in Vietnam. (And I want to tell you, they were some OLD aircraft.) The mission was know as CCS, Command & Control South, which involved flying cover for VNAF H34's as they took ARVN troops dressed as NVA soldiers into Cambodia. THAT was a fascinating mission, day and night, and one that deserves some author's attention.That said, it was interesting to see some of the birds I flew in Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos.Blue Max 44, Raider 44"
5,"Awsome CD, great seller",Love this type of music. track 4 is amazing....just put it on repeat. great experience.
4,"""Bloom"" doesn't just bloom--it blossoms!","In the vein of 2003's dance floor-bound REMIXED, Sarah McLachlan returns with another set of revamped (and, in some cases, revived) tracks culled from past albums. But whereas REMIXED left many feeling cold by just slapping souped-up dance beats underneath the tunes, Bloom actually gets it right. From Junkie XL's White Party-styled take on AFTERGLOW's ""World on Fire"" and the Dusted mix of FUMBLING TOWARD ECSTASY's ""Ice"" to Sly & Robbie's sultry, Deep Dish-esque revamp of the sumptuous ""Train Wreck"" (an AFTERGLOW standout) and Tom Middleton's joyous reinterpretation of ""Vox"" (from her oft-forgotten 1988 debut album TOUCH), the emphasis this time around is on creativity. Apart from the occasional misstep (Hyper's nearly vocal-free attack on ""Stupid"" is, well, just as the song's title implies) this pumped-up, club-ready collection reveals McLachlan's music to be incredibly rich in versatility."
1,ugh,i have to agree with some of the other reviewers before me: this is an absolute waste of money that should be avoided at all costs.i'd rather wait ten years for another sarah album than purchase yet another remix album.
1,First a crappy 8th grade poetry album and now this,"I WAS a big Sarah fan since the FTE days.Some of the remixes done by RITM and the remix of Silence which is not a strictly Sarah track, but we all know that.This album is absolute crap.There are two remixes on the Album that are worth their weight.08 - sarah mclachlan - answer (talvin singh mix)09 - Fallen (Gabriel Dresden Anti-Gravity Mix)Everything else is bottom rung IMO and even these two only stand out like nickles in cow manure.I could not stand the 8th grand ryme and pantamater of the last album and this album is the edm equivilent.Let her go, shes done."
1,Who thought this was a good idea?,"Leave the hip hop to rappers. Leave the silly drum effects for children's music, and pray for Sarah to write new music that is worthy of her talent."
4,Not Bad,"This album has had good reviews and bad reviews but I think if you like her music you should get it, also try KMB if you like this album."
2,disappointing,"These remixes are not very good. Very disappointing seeing as the first remix album of hers was very good.It's ""OK"""
1,Why is Amazon still selling this spyware-riddled cd???,"Not a review per se, but this cd is one of the famous recalled Sony/BMG ""Rootkit""- infested anti-copy/spyware cd's. It is known to crash computers and open a backdoor to malicious hackers!I love Sarah, but she has (unwittingly, I hope) had this cd released containing the most sleazy, invasive spyware ploy ever foisted by a major corporation on the American public. All thinking, caring music lovers should boycott Sony for their cynical, destructive, abusive business practices. Just Google ""Sony cd recall"" for this scary story.You will never buy Sony again afterwards!"
1,This CD installs malware on your computer,"This cd installs malware that causes you to have trouble ripping this AND other cd's. Don't buy it, this is evil cr*p. You can download the mp3's here though!"
2,I dislike remixes,"I agree with a previous review - these remixes are getting tiring. I am one of the biggest Sarah fans, but I just don't care to have her voice ruined in this way. Pick up the Fumbling CD and enjoy Sarah the way it is meant to be enjoyed. Maybe soon Sarah will grace us with more original material."
1,Something New?,I agree with the other review that said this is enough! It's been almost 8 years and she's done NOTHING new. You can't release 200 best of CD's of the same album. Who wants 75 cds of the song Possssion? It's downright pathetic.
1,Apparently some of you don't get it,"The one-star reviews aren't so much for the content on this album as they are for the fact that Sarah has released another filler record. She's a joke, anyway. She can't come up with new material so she decides to offer her fans a lame remix album? Talk about a sell-out!"
1,Do not buy this album,"As long as Sarah is on Sony I will never again purchase one of her albums. This spyware, copy protection scheme is borderline illegal, it's intrusive, and makes playing the music I paid for a pain in the behind.Some of the tracks are good, but not worth putting spyware on your machine. Just go download them.Don't support companies that violate your privacy, and don't support artists that accept fat contracts from said companies."
3,Mediocre,"Well, this cd is decent, but not anything overwhelming. I already had 3 of these songs on other cd's, including G&D remix of ""Fallen."" I believe there abpproximately 180,000 remixes of Sarah's songs (bootleg and contracted) so this is yet another handful as ""Remixed"" was. The copy protection pisses me off too. You can make three copies of the cd and cannot download it onto your iPod unless you email the record company so you can get the back door code to do that. Frustrating. Please boycott all copy protected cd's! If you really want these songs, downlad them from iTunes, especially if you have an iPod."
4,SHE'S ALL THAT,"i haven't seen the movie 'shes all that' in a whilebut i remember seeing it when i was like 10, and i really loved itive been looking for it everywhere, so in the end i just bought it of hereif you like teen romance movies, then i suggest you buy this movie (:"
3,Review,"They are not what I was expecting, or maybe I was too demanding. They are comparable to Ecco shoes, for double the price."
2,Refurbished - not repaired,"I wore my Mephistos occasionally for three years and found them heavy but very comfortable. Then the leather strip around the laces separated from both shoes. They want $75 to ""refurbish"" - sounds better than repair - and add new laces. I bought a tube of Shoe Glu for $4.00 and did the job myself. When you buy Mephistos, you really don't get what you pay for."
3,Not Much Flavor,"I got this as a gift for my husband who loves Milka products. He tried it and didn't care for the flavor. It didn't taste like Milka; in fact, it didn't have much flavor at all."
1,Milka Choco Drink Powder,"Does not completely disolve in milk, poor flaver, I expected the taste to be better than American produced chocolate drink. One needed substantally more drink powder than American products. I was extremely disappointed, and I would never buy it again. I have used the Milka discs in the Bosch machine with great results."
5,Definitely better than American store bought,"The American products are mostly sugar with a little chocolate. This is its exact opposite--mostly chocolate with some sugar, yet still pleasingly sweet."
3,a synthesis of the current understanding,"For plant biologists or non-plant biologists, this is a text that deserves a careful study. Writing in a easy way, it describes various aspects of the C4 plant research. I am sure that anyone interested in plants will find related chapters or sections inspiring. However, most chapters may interest plant ecophysiologists more. M.D. Hatch provides a vivid story on the discovery of the C4 pathway. I believe this chapter alone(Chapter 2) will have a wider audience."
2,Much rehash with very little relevant new stuff,I was disappointed to read this loosely knitted book of warmed up previous information mixed with a bit of new stuff much of which was rather unrelated to the title and the advertising hype. Sorry.
3,Not sure how much of it was really new,"This book was published in 1995, after the opening of the Soviet archives, but I'm not really sure how much of its information was really new. After all, the Bunker witnesses who had been interrogated by the Soviets had been released in the 1950s and subsequently interviewed, most comprehensively and satisfactorily by James O'Donnell in his book, ""The Bunker"". We have known about the details of Hitler's death for decades. It seems like the only things revealed by the Soviet archives were certain souvenirs from the Bunker and certain details about their investigation. Surprisingly though, for a book purporting to unveil all the ""secrets"" of the Soviet archives, it does not include a picture of the famous skull fragment with the bullet hole in it. In any case, it's overall a pretty interesting book, but its wild claims of revolutionary scholarship seem a bit overblown."
4,More than just a PODCAST Studio,"This package comes with everything you need to not only create Podcasts, it's also great for starting a homerecording studio. I have also used it to create sound tracks for the theatre group I work with. Behringer puts put a great product for the price."
3,PODCastStudio Review,"The package is perfect if you are using one XLR microphone. If you need to use additional microphones you will experience volume issues even though the mixer board has additional ports (1/4"" jacks).If you need to use more than one XLR microphone I would recommend buying a different mixer board.The software is very easy to use."
2,CD ROM MISSING,There was no CD ROM with the software in the bundle....EXTREMELY NOT HAPPY and think this is very unprofessional on Behringer and Amazon's part
3,Good for 'Newbies',"Just received the Podcaststudio. Was dissapointed in the fact that I could not find appropriate 'easy to follow' instructions on how to hook it up. I am very new to this so I needed to have someone walk me through it. Did not find any appropriate written instructions. I was able to find a video instruction or two on the internet. I must admit though that I was impressed with how the owner started the company and how young he is. (They had a lot of information on that :-) )The above being said, it is a good starter package."
5,Awesome!,"I purchased this product because of the reviews I have read. I do voice overs and I podcast as well. This set up is perfect for me. The headphones are pretty good, I like the fact that on the headphone you can unscrew the plug and use the smaller plug for other applications such as a mp3 player. The microphone works quite well! The board itself is perfect in my opinion. It gets the job done. It also came with a software bundle that is very useful. My order was delivered on time. I am very pleased with my purchase! The price is right too!"
2,Many Mistakes,"While this book is a cheaper alternative to the hardcover, there are many mistakes in the printing. There are little dots where there should be parentheses, brackets and square root signs in the problem section. It makes the problems hard to understand if you do not know what symbols are supposed to be there. If you are using this for a class, make sure have someone else's book to compare it to. I know it is not just my book because everyone with the soft cover in my class has the same problem."
1,"i hated it,didn't even finish reading it & i love her stuff!",ugh ! i gave it away and didn't come close to reading even half of it! VERY disappaointed in one of my favorite authors.
3,A Satisfactory DVD,"Recess: The Worlds Favorite Cartoon...I remember when I found out about this DVD I figured it would be a whole hour on how the gang met in kindergarden but boy was I wrong! The DVD is only a review of 3 old episodes and then a short stupid episode of how they ""met"" and for some strange reason Gus just ""happened"" to go to kindergarten there for a few days (that was too cheesy for me). I am a HUGE Recess fan but I have to say, I was very dissapointed. Not to mention the voice of TJ is torture to listen to! I mean it sounds like it's a boy in the middle of puberty with a cracking voice! It's just not that ol' spunky TJ! But if you're up to see 3 old episodes of Recess then go and buy this dissapointing but still satisfactory DVD!"
5,Cider house rules,"The Cider House Rules was the most inspirational, intriguing, and controversial book of this time period. John Irving touches on some of Americas Achilles heels such as Race discrimination, Abortion, incest, and rights for under privilege kids. Irving uses a very honest and entertaining approach to this story. Irving uses very realistic characters, which makes the book that much easier to relate to. This novel of Merit will live on for century's to come I give it five stars for its Creativity, and Honesty."
5,The Cider House RULES!,"The only reason why I even read this book was because it was on the sophmore reading list and I had to read a novel for an assignment. I'm glad that I chose to read it. It is one of the best novels that I have read in a long time. My youth leader at my church said that it's not a good idea to read this book because it was on abortion. That made me want to read it even more. When I read it, I was so surprised how John Irving put both opinions of abortion in this book and made it fit in. I really enjoyed this book. It's so much more than abortion. Its about being loved and fitting in. I enjoyed this book so much!"
4,Interesting Presentation of an Ageless Conflict!,"An issue that society must still consider is presented in this book which deals with abortion and adoption in an earlier time period. An obstetrician, founder and director of the town orphanage is both an ether addict and an abortionist. It is the story of Homer, the doctor's favorite orphan, who is never adopted. A moving, sometimes humorous, and thought-provoking story.Evelyn Horan - teacher/counselor/authorJeannie, A Texas Frontier Girl - Books One - ThreeGirl, Books One - Three"
5,Thought-provoking and real,"John Irving has this incredible ability to create complex, interesting characters and place them in the most unusual situations. I was completely fascinated by this book. From the perennial orphan Homer, to the misnamed Melony, to the ether-addicted and opinionated Dr. Larch, all of the characters were very real and very different. You understand their motivations and emotions, even if you don't always agree with them.One thing that I really liked about this book is that although it dealt with many important social issues (such as abortion and racism), it was never preachy. Rather than coming right out and blatantly stating his opinions, Irving skillfully weaves the issues into the plot for the reader to interpret.I have not yet seen the movie, and after reading the book I'm not quite sure that I want to because I know that the complexity of the plot and characters can in no way be expressed in a few hours of film. I would definitely recommend this book."
5,INCREDIBLE,"I don't understand why Irving doesn't get the awards that he deserves for writing books like Cider House and Owen Meany. No other author that I have ever read can take controversial subjects and make the reader look at them objectively. About the story- the characters are richly painted word after word throughout the whole story. Irving is a master of detail, but not to the point where the reader becomes bored. This is one of Irving's best works. It is disappointing that he only comes out with a book once every 7 years or so. Well, at least that lets us enjoy the stories that much longer!"
4,"I liked the book, but don't quite understand it.","I really enjoy John Irving books as they always are a little quirky and atypical. This book read like two however: Part one, the orphanage...Part two ... the apple orchard. The thing that disturbed me was that when Homer FINALLY comes clean with his quest for the truth in his relationship with Angel, he does an about face and prepares for the second phase of his life in another huge lie. I question how a character seeking truth so badly would consider living yet another lie. Homer and Larch were characters beautifully developed. Throughout the book Melony kept me in suspense, due to her explosive potential. Don't get me wrong: it was a very good book - but I can't believe how willingly Homer lives another lie."
5,Very Well Written!,"This book was very intriguing, and very well written. It dealt with how hard it can be for someone to love both the men and her life and to have to choose. It also deals with an older doctor who runs a orphan and an abortion clinic at the same time; he has a hard time expressing his love for a young man who eventually leaves, and also deals with an ether addiction he's had for most of his life. It is a great book and I'd recommend it to most people. Although I think it would better suit older teenagers and adults, just to understand the entire thing."
2,rather boring,"I really don't understand why all of the other readers gave this book such high ratings. This was the first John Irving book that I have ever read, and I was extremely disappointed. I could not even finish reading it, I got halfway through, only to find myself struggling to complete each chapter. The first half of the book was interesting - I enjoyed Homer's experiences at the orphanage, but once he left, the ""spark"" was gone, and I found the remainder of the book to be nothing but dull and monotonous. I certainly hope this book is not exemplary of Irving's best writings. Although his writing style shows talent, the plot of this novel does not."
3,Not one of Irving's bests,"I'm definitely an Irving fan, having read 7 of his books. However, this is not one of my top three. I was a bit disappointed. I found that THE CIDER HOUSE RULES lacked some of the emotional zeal that A WIDOW FOR ONE YEAR and THE WORLD ACCORDING TO GARP had. I never fell in love with the characters of this book."
2,Disappointing,"I had really looked forward to reading this book. I had heard many great things about Irving and am interested in the issue of abortion. I was very frustrated with the characters' inability to take charge of their lives; they were all so unwilling to change that they had no chance of happiness. Also, I thought that most of the characters lacked complexity. Also, prochoice or prolife, I don't think this book promotes a level of complex thinking on the aborition issue or could alter anyone's perspective. For me, this book became a chore to read."
1,HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT,"The Cider House Rules was one of the worst books I've ever subjected myself to read. I felt as if I was not getting into the heads of any of the characters. I was not feeling, even though Wilbur was devastated of losing a ""son"" in Homer I could care less. Usually with any well written books I am completely entranced, turning the pages one after another, swept in emotions. With this novel I would rather watch a movie for the fifth time or a television show rerun. I would seriously suggest not reading this particular Irving novel,but rather a worthwhile book such as, A Prayer For Owen Meany, or A Widow for One Year. These are meaningful, interesting books that you will not fall asleep reading."
1,Impossible to finish,"I'm a John Irving fan but this book is very bad. I bought this book, in part, because of the customer reviews on this site. What in the world are you people thinking. This is Irving's worst book. If you have never read a book by Irving please go directly to ""Owen Meany"" at least you will be able to finish that book."
1,I agree...,"with Valerie Barbour. This book was very disappointing. It was slow, boring, and depressing."
1,One star,"It is disheartening to pick up a book that is well-rated by so many and find that it is unendurable. I can see why a 15-year old might find this book entertaining, but why would an adult spend any time with it?"
1,The quick and the dead are identical in this book.,"With the exception of Dr. John Larch, Homer Wells, and Melony, all of the characters in this book are as thin as the paper they are printed on. It is a novel, so things happen, but nothing really matters or has any effect on anyone's life. Not so that you care about it. One couple arrives to take in Homer, and you know that they are going to die at the first hint of danger. They do. Once again Homer hitchhikes back to the orphanage. These three are all attached to the orphanage by some kind of umbilical cord. The nurses and the other orphans barely exists since their character developement is so poor. This book and its author have joined my list of books/authors that I will never read another word of. There are far too many adequate books to read to bother with this book. ..."
3,Good writing-extreme detail,"The book was well written; however, I felt like there was way to much detail concerning how abortions are done. A lot of this could have been left out and still gotten his point across. If your the least bit weak in the stomach, don't read this book."
4,Complex characters,Irving forces the reader to acknowledge that it is difficult to be self-righteous about a controversial issue as abortion once you attach a face to the tragedy.
2,Cider House a disappointing read.,"I'm afraid I have to disagree with the majority of the other reviews. I had high hopes upon reading the first several chapters, but was disappointed with the final outcome. The characters turned out a bit pathetic and ridiculous with the exception of Melony.Too many stereotypical, over dramatized situations were used to address the abortion issue leaving the political points to be unconvincing either way. Including ignorant immigrants, shallow snobbish wealthy people, and a eccentric prostitute, none of which, touched on the ""everyday"" women and men who deal with this issue. Candy who was, perhaps, supposed to represent the ""average"" young woman in trouble, began as independent and forward thinking but, ended up annoying and indecisive.The characters were initially unusual and colorful, but without development, did not hold my interest. Cider House Rules was a story with potential, but fizzled out half way through."
3,Oft Overrated,"I picked up my copy of this book at an airport when I realized I'd packed all of my books in the checked baggage, so I have to admit it's not the sort of book I would normally gravitate toward. I read it almost nonstop during the 12-hour flight, but in a way I felt I was doing so against my will. As so many people have noted, Mr. Irving is a masterful storyteller and the subtlety of his humor and observations of human nature pulled me through the book even as my mind revolted against the weak, unconvincing and almost pointless plot. I didn't find any of the characters to be especially likeable or interesting with the possible exception of Dr. Larch (Homer the Heroesque was particularly annoying, inconsistent, and unbelievable) and even he wasn't someone I'd care to know in real life. If I found myself in the position of having to choose between John Irving and Maeve Binchey again I'd choose Mr. Irving every time, but I can't imagine actually seeking him out in a bookstore."
5,Riveting!,"This was an amazing novel! I don't want to undermine the excellent performances (especially Michael Caine) in the movie, but the novel was much, much, much better. I read the book before I saw the movie and my appreciation for it was increased all the more. Irving's story-telling is absolutely beautiful and intriguing--his creative characters and storyline are brilliant. I truly enjoyed reading this heart-warming novel and I will continue to read Irving's works. Wow."
5,DELIBERATELY DETAILED!,"You can never say the John Irving, doesn't give you your money's worth. I just finished C.H.R and I will say that it is a heavier read,and more complex than GARP, But that is not to say it wasn't grand. I have yet to find a writer who can spread words like warm butter, his sentences roll off the tongue with ease.I haven't seen the movie yet and I will look for it now and to compare notes. I loved this novel, the characters are so vivid and real, the settings, even down to the smells are so clear in this book. It reads like a thousand page novel, but in only 600 pages. There is so much vivid and important detail that it is simple amazing. Irving is one great writer. His story's are so rich. I hope he will write more and more."
5,a must read,a powerful book - a must read! A page turner for sure. I've missed my stop on the bus getting lost in this story. Enjoy!
2,preaching to the choir,"Irving here waxes righteous over womens' right to choose-- a worthy enough cause, but, get serious, how many readers of fiction need to be convinced? This book, like pretty much everything since GARP, is overwritten, cumbersome, panders to the kleenex-toting audienceship, and it lacks almost entirely the vital, exciting, effervescent imaginative wildness that blazed through GARP, appeared in, oh, 50% of HOTEL NH, and has since been AWOL in Irving's writing. Once again, popularity and wide readership diverge from lasting literary value, with Irving and his ardent devotees taking the road more traveled by."
1,Don't bother reading this book,This was one of the worst books I ever read. I really enjoyed Owen Meaney and thought I'd give Irving another shot - what a mistake. The mind-numbing repetition of the same theme over and over for 600 + pages and the obvious plot development were pure torture. None of the characters were sympathetic - it was hard to care about any of them.
3,Weak for Irving,"After reading a handful of Irving's other books, I was expecting much more from The Cider House Rules. Irving is THE best writer, and Cider House did not feel up to par with his usual convincing characters. I found myself continually questioning some of the main characters, as they were weak in development. It just seemed unimaginable on occasion. The lack of character and story line ruined the flow of reading for me. I also didn't ""believe"" the ending of the book: the course and resolve within relationships and even the choices made. Rather a disappointment."
3,So wordy,"I must admit that the book just was not good enough to hold my interest. I am an avid reader who is interesed in many sorts of books, and while the book deals with issues that may be hard for some readers (abortion and adoption), the amount of charecters and Irving's constant backflashes and side stories really did me in. I wished it could have been better, but for people who really like a challenge, you should definately dive right in."
5,Ironic Irving,What an imagination John Irving has. In his short story 'Trying to Save Piggy Snead' we get an inkling of an idea as to why and how he can write the way he does. No doubt this book will be repopularized by the movie version. John Irving has done his best to 'protect' the story line and characters as he has written the screenplay. Notwithstanding the fact that it is easy and entertaining to just lean back and watch it on the big screen... the Cider House Rules is better told in the novel. You will not be disappointed by the movie or the novel...but by far the novel is a richer and more rewarding story.
2,"Weak Plot, No Strong Characters","I started out with much anticipation but was disappointed with this novel. The novel starts out with strong characters and a strong plot but weakens miserably by the end. It's as if the author could not finish the story and did patchwork on it. The only character in the book that is strong is the old doctor's. The story is completely unbelivable in any age and time. You do not feel for the characters (except for the old doctor). In this era of discussion regarding abortion, the only thing the book accomplishes is highlighting the plight of women who could not make their own choices due to the government rules. Other than that it is a complete disappointment!"
2,Whew! I finally got through it!,"I found this book literate but boring. I felt nothing for the characters. I thought the whole medical descriptions part unneccesary and gimmicky. I found it repetitious and predictable and and cliched. I felt it needed a good editing, so I will rent the movie when it comes out to see what the editors did with it. Oh well. I bought it on a little island in Greece where there weren't a lot of choices for English language novels. Next time I'll be sure to bring along enough reading material so I don't get stuck."
3,Interesting book,"The book was captivating although a little long. It could have been shortened 100 pages without a loss to the story line (especially all those parentheses)! Overall, it was quite entertaining."
2,A fabulously unexceptional effort.,"John Irving succeeded at writing a miserably mundane work that fails at creating three dimensional characters, a dynamic between said characters, and anything beyond the revelations a typical child has on a slow day. The only saving grace of The Cider House Rules remains to be the author's notes that grace the end of the novel."
5,Better than Owen Meany,"I bought this book 7 years ago, and could never get into it. I then bought it on tape for a trip cross country and fell in love with it . Irving has a gift of story telling. The book was detailed without being overbearing, and incredibly interesting. I don't agree with abortinon but he really mad me think about the whole subject in a new light. All in all a great modern classic"
3,Ran out of steam,"I absolutely loved the first half of this story, then it just seemed to run out of steam. The novel starts at one level and just goes on and on and on at the same level. There's no real narrative tension and less plot than your typical novel. Granted, the focus of the book were the characters, but the only character who changed substantially was Melony, a minor character. The main character did change at the very end, but it was so predictable as to be laughable. I had to force myself to read the last third of the book and was sorry I did because there is no payoff at the end."
5,Irving at his best,"Although I read them years ago, Garp and New Hampshire have been two of my all time favorites, but I had never read The Cider House Rules until this week. What a treat it was! In the best John Irving fashion, the author, while at times making the absurd appear commonplace, squeezed our hearts with a story that showed us some of both the best and worst of what we are. He made me ask myself just what are the rules that govern my life."
3,"a good, funny story- a great book no","This is an entertaining novel with lots of local color of New England. It is written in 3rd person Omniscient voice, which is fine BUT John Irving cant resist the inclusion of multitudes of parenthetical ( often- smart-aleck ) statements in the text. This is lazy writing. Also, Irving feels the need to ""out-Garp Garp"", thus including more filth than should be necessary. So in summary, a fun lightweight tome full of the zany, dirty, Irving characters we've come to expect."
4,Thought provoking reading experience,"As the mother of four adopted children my life experiences have definitely tempered my reading of this novel. The novel is well-written and most of the characters are true to life. Unfortunately, the author is biased in his negative presentation of the characters who are pro-life. If nothing else I believe an open-minded person will realize that the issues surrounding abortion cannot be resolved with a for or against stance. There is so much more to taking the life of a unborn child than what appears on the surface. I truly feel we need more support for all persons involved in making either decision. That support and information should start in the preteen years through the loving conversations of parents with their children. Only then will the issues be addressed in as non emotional setting as possible and perhaps give individuals the determination not to find themselves as adults faced with making such a critical decision."
3,Great grammar -- a century ago.,"I enjoy studying the Septuagint very much, and if you do as well, it would behoove you to acquire this book for reference purposes.As a text book, it is barely usable, however. The book was first published in 1905 and its text has hardly been touched since. It is amazing to think of all the hard work that went in to compiling the vast amount of information present in the grammar, especially without the aid of a computer.The downside to this book is that it is a great example of a 19th century grammar (the century within which I presume most of it was researched and written). This is a bad thing because I think students will have a difficult time with it (I know I have), keeping up their interest and actually understanding the material. Given the paucity of teaching resources on the LXX, this is a tragedy. But, in spite of a dire need for major updating, this book is very handy as a reference tool and I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in it as such."
2,Vietnam Fox Comapany,Incoherent writing. I had to keep referring back and forth to keep track of who what when where and how. Photos were grainy and thick with loss of detail. Too small as well.Fox Comapany kicked ass though.
5,Great banjo picker,Replacing my LP albums. This is a great classic bluegrass banjo CD. The seller was great.
2,broke :(,"The teeth looked as advertised and wound up nicely, but didn't last past the first half hour of my kids playing with them. They overwind pretty easily."
1,Lasted 1 day,"The metal is so cheap the spikes caused a groove and the toy is rendered useless, so cheap. Waste of money."
4,Good Buy,I got this as a gift for my father. He rides his Harley all the time and loves having this kit.
4,Shipping not on time,"Hi,I purchased this as there was $8 mailin rebate if I send the rebate within 15 days from purchase. As most of Amazon productes reach after 15 days, you shold take care that atleast 30 days are given for sending the rebate. Can you please revert back on what should be done as I received the product after 15 days from purchase date.ThanksPraveen"
1,Item not delivered in reasonable time frame,I canceled the order of Velocity DVD-R disks since it took too long to deliver.
4,No Recording or Rebate Problem,"This is my second purchase of this item. I did not experience any problem with the first ten and the rebate came as quickly as any rebate. The reviewer who indicated that the rebate was a scam may not have submitted the request. I did, even though the product arrived more than 15 days after the date I purchased the item from Amazon, and received it with no questions asked. At this price, it seems to be a good deal."
4,These medias are ok.,I only used it for backup my movies and documents. So far they all burned succeed without problems. The quality feels so so but they do work.
1,Not very compatible with Sony FS laptop,"I have used 6 DVD-R out of ten now. And 2 failed. I use Sony FS550. Maybe they are not very compatible, or I burned too much data on a single disc. (I usually burn 4450MB, close to the 4489 limit shown on Nero)"
3,"Mediocre Media, Can't Complain About the Price","I've only burned two of these so far, but the first one I burned failed from a media error. The second one finished burning, but my burner (a Pioneer DVR-104) only supported it at 1x. I'd complain a lot more, but it did have a free rebate, so hey. I wish they had a website where I could make a customer service inquiry, but I searched for quite a while and couldn't find one. Oh well."
4,Free AFTER REBATE its Media code is Optodisk ok for junk movies,"This media is free after rebate so you cant beat the price. But is it worth the effort to send out the rebates? hmm depends on how lazy you are with rebates. Anycase this is a Media code from the manufacture Optodisk. though its not listed from www.dvdhelp.com yet. I burned one movie to it and it seemed to work fine. I'm not sure how well it would be at full speed though. I dont like to risk burning fast so i go at 2x or 2.4x most of the time. though i do have a 8x drive my max write is 4 for any media. my logic is that if it cant read faster then 8x how could it write as fast? Someone with a drive that can read PI/PO errors and jitter test like a Benq would be better suited to read the quality of the media. So far my one burn is great:) I always do a verify test. the shippment came late for me cause the item wasnt in stock at the time. but amazon emailed me about that, im happy i got the items though."
5,LET'S JACK!!!,"TKC DROPPIN THAT OL SKOOL IS A CRAZY HOT ALBUM INTO THE HOUSE WORLD ALL THE SONGS ON THE ALBUM IS ALL BIG HOUSE FAMILY ALBUM WELL IF YOU AT A PARTY AND HAD THAT CD AND TURN THE PARTY OUT WITH 'DONNIE', 'JACK YOUR BODY','CAN YOU DANCE''IT'S YOU' AND 'CAN YOU JACK' MAN YOU GOT TO GET THIS ALBUM JUST GO GET IT AND SEE WHAT I MEAN...............WHEN YOU LISTED TO IT?"
4,Queen Sayoko fails her Crusade,"Queen Sayoko was, like any OMG/AMG comic, full of comedy and charming. Still, it didn't deliver the punch to the funny bone or the romance I expect from the series. The fact also remains that the whole, very large, comic was made supporting a small, insignificant chapter from earlier in the series. Making such a big deal (book) out of so small a chapter seemed somewhat lame, to me.Overall, Queen Sayoko is both funny and charming, with the slightest hint of romance. Thus, it gets 4 stars, but loses out on the 5th one because it lacked the comedy-romance-charming ratio I'd expect from such a series."
5,fun stuff,"In this volume, Skuld gets her own angel, there's a completely smitten broom, and Sayoko becomes an ""all powerful"" queen. Although I haven't read all the Oh My Goddess books, I still had fun with this. I would like to find some of the other books, so I can find out how Skuld became a part of the group (that's a volume I missed). Belldandy is still the nicest character in the series, and I loved Skuld. Sayoko definitely shines in this book, as well. Very recommended. The art is gorgeous and the story should improve any bad mood."
5,"THE WORLD, THE FLESH AND THE DEVIL",WHAT A SURPRISE TO FIND THIS MOVIE. I HAD MEMORIES OF WATCHING IT YEARS AGO AS A TEENAGER AND IT WAS AS CAPTIVATING NOW AS IT WAS THEN. SIMPLE BUT GOOD. HARRY EVEN SANG A LITTLE WHICH I DID NOT REMEMBER.
3,Disappointing novel in the Wilcox series..,"This is about the third Wilcox novel in a row that made it seem like maybe the writer was in a creative rut or something. In this installment of the series, Carl is asked by his somewhat naive sister Annabelle to look into a murder where everyone suspects a friend of hers. A leader in the local band was home stabbed to death at a neighbor's, and signs point to the man's wife as the killer, but then a witness ends up dead under suspictious circumstances. He then does some more probing into the dead musician and beds yet another widow. In the end, he finds that nothing is as deadly as a mother's love for her child, and brings the true killer to justice."
3,Gently refining with a solid ep,"3 1/2Slightly more melodically intricate, this worthy companion (and perhaps slightly more developed) to Owen's debut is sure to please fans of the mellow progressions that lie in these soft but effective odes to lost love."
2,quit whining already and make some more good music!,"If it weren't for Mike Kinsella's talent and the first Owen album, I would only give No Good For No One Now a single star. The songs are good for the most part, even great, but I get sick of him whining about his relationships. Especially when his voice gets loud for a word or phrase and sounds horrible."
3,Nico - 'Nico Vs. Trance Groove' (Funfundvierzig),"CD single of Nico's ""Reich der Tramme"" track. Three different edits - believe I like the original eight-minute version the best. Guess I might have some catching up to do - I've heard of Nico before here and there but I didn't realize she appeared on two Velvet Underground lp's - 'Velvet Underground & Nico' ('67) and 'Andy Warhol's Velvet Underground'. I know - WHERE have I been?"
3,Good for a professional Computer Maintenance Tech,"This product though well built, is overkill for the average computer user. It's also rather loud and takes up a lot of space.I returned it and bought an aftermarket Mini-Vac attachment for my regular vacuum. It works just as well as the data-vac."
4,It's about time..........,"Finally this wonderfully creative band from the late 60's and early 70's gets their debut album released on cd. Featuring great vocals from Sal Valentino, Anne Sampson and Tim barnes just to name a few, Stoneground cut thru rock, blues and soul genres with ease. From the opening song, Looking for You, it's obvious this was not your ordinary band. Popular for the most part on the west coast, Stoneground had a solid following and built it's reputation on it's live shows. Boosting as many as ten to eleven members at a time, Stoneground's raw infectious brand of rock grabs the listener with it's varied styles and vocals. This album holds up remarkably well from it's first recording in 1971. To get the live experience, check out Stoneground Live, a very well recorded show from the early 70's."
1,Totally Unsatisfactory!!!!!!!!,"I bought this book today with the intentions of learning Visual Basic, however, I found out after opening this book that the author ""Assumes"" that people already know what he's referring to..... this book really goes over the ""Wizards"" very well, however, where's the BEEF? I am so disgusted with books that claim (which this one does) to provide ""Expert Insight"", ""Authoritive Advice"".... so in closing, if you're looking for a book that teaches you the wizards upside down, inside out and unsat *.txt files (for the source code which I must add are useless), then this book is for you! I gave it one * because there wasn't an area for 0 stars and that would be pushing it! Does that describe how unsatisfactory this book is?"
1,"OK Book, Misleading Title","When I read the title, ""Visual Basic 6 Unleashed"", and read the back of the book, ""you'll obtain the skills, understanding, and breadth of knowledge to unleash the full potential of VB6."" I was under the impression that this book would cover ALL (or at least most) of VB6. Instead it is a book which aids in making the transition from VB5 to VB6. Vital information is also missing. How can a book be titled VB6 Unleashed, without any info on WebClasses and IIS Applications? A technology new to VB6. I feel this book was pushed onto the bookstore shelves early (it was one of the first) and suffers because of it. I feel ""tricked"" into buying a book I didn't need. The title and summary on the back should more accurately reflect the contents of the book. If you need such a book, then this one is at least average."
2,The Intermediate-Advanced should be changed to beginning,"I found this book almost useless. The first chapters on the new features of VB 6 were helpful, but after that it is a beginning VB programming book. If you are looking for a reference guide, look elsewhere."
3,so so,"i loved elvis, tom jones and bodyrockers (1,6,7,14), the rest i don't even remember, although i've been listening to the CD for two days now (last time 10 minutes ago).should i say the rest of albume is boring? depends on your music taste.i like it a lil harder onthe side of rock, and the three tracks i like reflect that preference. the rest is kinda mushy in my opinion..it's a good thing you can listen to it on amazon before you buy it."
1,No Chill?,Where's all the downtempo chillout music? I never understood why studios release TV soundtracks that don't include all the songs. Haven't they ever heard of multi-disc albums?
2,Nice look but poor design,The price and look of this stool attracted me but the quality is not good.The problem is it is cheaply made and the company does a terrible job at packaging the product correctly before shipping.In fact I would not even say they pack it at all. They put the stool in a plastic bag and throw it in a box with no protection. The stool bangs around with the metal base and cracks. It dumbfounds me that they do not protect the plastic for shipping.I received 3 cracked seats. They have a responsive customer support that shipped me new ones.After a few months the height lever broke on one of them as well. The warranty had expired but they shipped a new one minus the shipping that I had to cover.2 stars for looks but I would not recommend this stool.
5,Perfect fit for the Ikea RAST,I bought these to screw into the Ikea RAST to use as my studio rack. They fit perfectly. Drill a couple screws in and you're ready to go.
4,Mighty Purple Is FINALLY Here,"I have been a fan of MP since 1994 and I can't say enough good things about them. While their 1995 studio album ""Black River Falls"" was excellent, the pinacle of an MP experience is seeing (or hearing) the band play live. The album captures the band both musically and personality-wise. I'm so happy that MP is finally getting the recognition that I feel they deserve..."
2,Underwhelming,"Purchased this for use with third graders who are struggling readers. With several exceptions, I found the passages to be much Lower in interest and higher in readability than what I anticipated."
1,Works til you go buy better.,"This was a last minute purchase while buying kitchen supplies for a new home on a limited budget. And I should have spent more money. While most of the utensils serve their basic functions, the lesser pieces fail. Miserably. The vegetable peeler failed me on carrots. And when I say it failed, I mean it failed in a shocking manner. The thin gauge metal turned it into a dangerous item to hold. The spatula is in no way heat resistant. The others lack rigidity, or just plain feel cheap.The high point of this set was that it shows that you cannot judge by packaging or pictures. It also serves as a lesson, or a reminder that you get what you pay for. And it's is also a good reason to upgrade as soon as possible."
3,cheaply made,"Granted you get what you pay for but I""m not really impressed by this. the pizza cutter broke the 1st time I used it"
3,you get what you pay for,"I expected more from a Sunbeam product, the can opener doesn't work, the spatula broke after a few uses and the silicone spreader fell apart, but I didn't pay much for it"
4,A book EVERYONE who votes should read!,Votescam opened my eyes to many things I wasn't aware of about how our votes are being stolen! A MUST READ for anyone who votes!
1,another great conspiracy fantasy,"i bought this book expecting facts about the voter fraud that has been a tradition in the Democratic party for most of a century. instead i get a wild eyed conspiracy theory with all powerful computers and a shadow government taking over America.if this book is true, why have we changed governments so many times in the past 40 years?voter fraud is very real, and sometimes even steals elections, but this book is simply garbage."
3,"Not so ""Extra Rigid"" but okay with extra cardboard inside.","Mailer is described as ""Extra Rigid"" in product title. It is not extra rigid. This mailer bends easily. I can very easily fold it in half with little or no effort.If you are going to use these for mailing photos or art, make sure extra cardboard, chipboard or foam core is used to sandwich your photos or art in-between to protect it, as this mailer easily bends in half when only one layer of chipboard is inside.I bought these because they were cheaper than other rigid mailers I've used in the past which were much thicker/sturdier. Disappointed that these are not ""Extra-Rigid"" as advertised."
5,Good Medium Envelope for Shipping Photos,The Quality Park Extra-Rigid Fiberboard Photo/Document Mailers are stiff and substantial enough to offer worry-free shipping of delicate photos using both USPS and FedEx. I have shipped both photos and DVD's in clam shell cases and have never had a problem with shipping damage.I would recommend these mailers for shipping photos that you want to arrive unbent and in one piece.
5,Beautiful!,"This is a beautiful form - an excellent example of internal martial arts. The form is shown from a few angles, the self defense applications explained and the movements taught in a classroom situation, step by step. In a separate section, you are taught how to use the body for each part of the form. The tape is well done and Tseng Yun Xiang, the teacher, performs it so beautifully. It is worth practicing this snake form even if you are not interested in fighting, but just to be able to be fluid and flexible. You really should see this."
1,terrible!,"the batter leaks with these, they are a terrible product, no wonder they are so cheap!! will never use them again."
5,VERY IMPRESSIVE!,I bought this book because a friend recommended it and I was NOT DISAPPOINTED! Lovecraft's style is so completely unique and his stories undeniably creepy.People who like to be scared will without a shadow of a doubt devour this book. :)
5,Best Edition in Paperback,This is the highest quality paperback available. Penguin goes-out-of their-way to craft a beautiful volume on traditional-style paper with superb illustrations. The stories are all Lovecraft's best classics. A collector's item for sure.
5,Gloriously disturbed!,A wonderful collection of very thrilling and very disturbing stories! I recently was introduced to Lovecraft and have found this collection of short stories to be extremely entertaining and I highly recommend it to any fan of horror/thriller stories!
3,Fairly good.,"Lovecraft is one of those writers you either love or hate. Some of it is just personal preference. For example, Lovecraft's prose is a baroque and complex. It is generally evocative but at times clumsy, but always suited to the story. If you prefer a more Hemingwayesque style then look elsewhere. If you don't like weird and scary works don't bother. However if you lack these prejudices then you might be interest. Lovecraft does have his faults though, his racism sometimes enters into the story as in ""He"". Also his fiction can range from the truely [bad] such as ""Herbert West-Re-animator"" to the astoundingly good such as ""The Colour out of Space"" and ""Shadow over Innsmouth."" It is foolish to present his fiction as flawless. However, it is even more foolish to ignore it."
4,"Lovecraft, a great nihilist","All men in the natural world feel the call from the vast infinite universe. What Lovecraft does is show mans insignificance. The creatures that he creates are so unexplainable and horrific that all aspects of mankind are completely overwhelmed. If you like big words and covert culture, this is the book for you."
1,Lovecraft Monopoly,"Yet another case of over-editing from the ""preeminent interpreter"", S. T. Joshi to quote the sales staff at Penguin. In that case about 90% percent of this book is interpretation. If you want Lovecraft look elsewhere."
3,I just don't get it;,"I just don't get it; did I receive the same video that has prompted so many glowing reviews? The production quality on this video was terrible. While I wasn't expecting this video to have a high budget, the poor quality actually interfered with the tai chi workout; I could not hear Bob Klein's instructions, and the video itself appeared to be a duplication of a duplication, etc etc...complete with VHS lines on screen. Bob Klein's instructions, at first, were helpful, but as the video progressed, he seemed to get caught up in doing the forms for himself, and not the viewer. This was not my first experience with tai chi, and I dont recommend this video for a first time workout. There are helpful elements in this video, but do yourself a favor and buy Dr. Paul Lam's DVD ""Tai Chi : the 24 forms."""
5,You Won't Get Bored With This One,"I am a fan of Dan Duryea and will watch anything with him in it. So, I came across TOO LATE FOR TEARS and was newly introduced to Lizabeth Scott. The pairing of Duryea and Scott in this film is magic. Lizabeth Scott has to be the ultimate femme fatale, or at least in this film. It is worth watching just for the dialog between Scott and Duryea alone. There are also good performances by Arthur Kennedy as Lizabeth Scott's hen-pecked husband and Don Defore, as the brother of Lizabeth Scott's deceased husband prior to Arthur Kennedy.This is one of the best film noir's I've seen. The plot moves along at a good clip and you certainly will not be bored."
4,Techno Funk Cuts - Slow and Fast,"All entertaining funk/R&B oriented material but a bit top heavy on the synthesizers and overdubbed voices on the first few cuts, even for my tastes (and I generally enjoy the techno sound).However, the back half of the album, with the more understated songs, is very nice. ""Part of Me"" (Maurice White vocals) and the instrumental ""Quest"" are really grabbing.Of the faster moving tunes, ""Never Give Up"" and the title track ""Fantasy"" are the best, in my view."
3,Unique Sound,"Many people say that Bayside sounds much like the Alkaline Trio. Personally I don't hear that much of a similarity. The only band I've ever heard the same sound from is Finding Westerly.If you have heard Finding Westerly, picture a Finding Westerly with darker lyrics and a higher emphasis on instrumentals. If you can picture that, you have Bayside. They have a very strong sound, and are fast paced. It's not Finding Westerly, but worth a listen."
5,A great cd,"When I bought this cd for some reason I was expecting Bayside to sound like Taking Back Sunday or Thursday, but instead it was more like Alkaline Trio. I was not disappointed though, this cd has amazing guitar solos and beautiful and poignant dark lyrics. Check them out, this band will go far."
4,I normally don't like these type of bands.,"I first heard ""Masterpiece"" by Bayside on a sampler I got with Thursday's ""Full Collapse"". I wasn't expecting much since the rest of the cd featured bands that I flat out hate, like Spitalfield. The song was okay so I figured why not listen to the whole cd. It was surprising how good this cd was. What sets this band apart from the rest, in my mind, is the vocals. Instead of the same old whiney/nasal, NFG type vocals you hear all the time, the band uses smooth vocals that really help the music along. I'd recommend this cd to anyone who is looking for something different than bands like NFG, Taking Back Sunday, and Spitalfield, but still easy to get into."
5,amazing,"Bayside has an almost unique sound, but it is definitly amazing. The lyrics in Bayside's songs are so deep but at the same time, so realistic. In addition, the songs themselves are so catchy. The first time I listened to Bayside was ""Just Enough to Love You"". I loved it, when I found out it wasn't the best track on the album I just couldn't wait to hear more songs from them. So then I hear ""Masterpiece"" and I knew I was addicted. All the songs are so true...And not many people write true songs anymore. It's amazing how well they sound, there is not a flaw on this album. I strongly recommend getting Hawthorne Heights, ""The Silence In Black and White"" if you like Bayside."
2,Yes they do sound just like alkaline trio!,Im gonna have to agree with the reviewer who compared Bayside to alkaline trio... and disagree with the one who said they didnt. and if you want to hear something that sounds just like alkaline trio you might as well buy alkaline trio.not a big fan of em but fav track on here is kellum
5,Was this cd made for me?,"I got a cd with 5 songs from artists from victory records on it and masterpeice was on it. at first i didnt like it but i was soon singing along and i had to get the cd- i wasnt let down. Their lyrics are really cool (take this razor and sign your name in my wrist so everyone can know who made me like this, Its not too cool to be throwing up, the sharper the edge the cleaner the wound, so ill be keeping it dull tonight because i deserve to hurt) and the singers voice anthony is somewhat distorted and it makes it sound cool instead of those catchy but often annoying singers. and finally some decent riffs that arent two notes over and over again. I also liked that all their songs had the same feel but with different beat like acuiesce was poppy, just enoguh to love you had a latin guitar, and alchohal was very hard. Thank you bayside for making a great album and thank you Taking Back Sunday for giving me a carppy let down, but giving me bayside."
4,Not to shabby,"I bought this CD after hearing ""Masterpiece"" on the Victory sampler, just like the rest of the world. All though the band doesn't seem to bring much to the table, I find myself listening to this CD all the time. While ""Masterpiece"" is a great song, tracks 6, 7, and 9, I think are the best on the album. Also there is no screaming like the rest of the Victory bands, so its smoother listening for the more melodic fans. It also is a more rock sound, not a whiney emo sound like the rest of the bands out there. A definite buy, unlike Hawthorne from the sampler."
3,Fun Video for football fans,"There's more than just stumbles and falls on this video (like a story about a super fan with disgusting 15 yr old food in the back of a breaking down Pinto), but still another fun video in the series. My young boys get a kick out of watching them, but especially enjoy the first two in the Greatest Follies Series which has more bloopers and less ""stories""."
3,definitely miami music,"first couple of tracks: YAWN- way over played.once the groove starts goin' though, the cd bumps!the mixing is good and there are actually a couple songs i have never heard which are really good (ie. #5 ).good cd to introduce people to the music. easy listening and not to intense. has that distinct miami sound. good stuff."
3,Great CD!,Great CD! Has a pop/rock feel for anyone who loves that type of music mixed with worship music.
4,Good PR DVD,"Of the 5 (so far) available Ninja Storm DVDs, this isn't my favorite. But I'm such a Hunter/Blake fan, that I can't be unbiased. Good Will Hunter was the best from the episodes, with All About Beevil coming in close 2nd. I just wasn't a fan of Scent of a Ranger, but CyberCam was amusing. The DVD is a must for Ninja Storm fans, but Looming Thunder and Lightening Strikers were my favorites."
5,What memories!,Man the memories that this CD brings back! I was in college and. . . . well it was a better world then!
3,OK for the price but watch out for sharp edges,"So I rarely review items but felt this one needed a quick warning, I have had these for a couple months and they work fine, very easy for a competent handyman to figure out how to install... HOWEVER I just ripped a 2 inch hole in my pants as I sat down to work at my desk this evening, thankfully my phone was there to keep the metal edge from cutting skin! (and it was the back so no screen damage) I can't believe I missed this so far but there is a small area of the metal runner at the front that the plastic cover doesn't protect you from. Should be easy to fix with tape or by bending with some pliers so not a deal breaker, I just wish I had noticed sooner."
4,Great product with a small problem,"I ordered two sets of these slides to reattach 2 shallow drawers to the underside of my grandfather's handmade trestle style table. I needed to adjust the height of the slides but the set screws wouldn't budge. I emailed the company on Saturday evening and was very happy to find a reply Sunday morning, suggesting that the paint may not have cured completely when the screws were inserted, creating the problem. There were suggestions for ways to loosen the screws. I used a combination of methods and it took all day - trying, leaving it for a while, coming back to try again. Finally around 5 pm the last screw came loose. From there it was a piece of cake and the drawers were easily attached. Had it not been for this problem, these would have received 5 stars. I was extremely pleased with the fast responses from the company. The price is very good and the product works well."
5,Great,"Go to ikea's scrab department get some loose wood boards and built my own computer desk to my own specs ,happy camper"
5,Solid and Sturdy,"This unit installed very quick and easy with a (seperate) custom wood tray built for my desk. It feels very solid and sturdy, compared to what it was replacing. Would definitely recommend.My only complaint was the shipping cost & not being Prime eligible, however the product is still top notch quality, definitely 5 stars worthy."
5,Does the job well,It's basically as good as a keyboard slide can possibly be at this price. The only trouble I had with mine was that one of the screws to adjust the height was in so tight I practically stripped the head trying to loosen it. Once that was resolved it's been awesome.
3,Wifes pain relief,"We went to a chiropracter and he suggested I read this book, he is a friend of Dr Faber. I read the book and my wife was in great back pain, she wanted relief the book suggested,her symptons and relief. The chiropracter perfomed the procedure and she is walking and moving with little or no pain after 12 years. The book is easy to read, I've passed my copy on to a friend and have ordered another book for another friend."
2,Toy,"This is not a stand for the gigging musician. I have burned through at least three of these in the past few years. The clamp is flimsy and although it is conceptually good (it grabs your headstock when you place the guitar on it) it cannot stand up to the rigors of constant loading and unloading, set ups and tear downs under varying circumstances, and being jostled around in car trunks and equipment trucks. It's great if it never leaves your bedroom or rehearsal space, but I'd pass on it for real gigging. It's pretty much a toy."
4,Guitar Stand,Bought this as a gift for my brother - he said he put it to work as soon as he pulled it out of the box. He really likes it. I haven't seen it for quality - because he lives halfway across the country - but he says it's good.
5,Hercules GS415B A/G Guitar Stand Fold Neck,"How can you go wrong with Hercules Equipment? You can't, but that is what you pay for. Hercules . . are you ready for this . . the Cadillac of music stand equipment."
4,Must-have book for your Indy 500 memorabilia collection,This is a must-have book for any serious Indianapolis 500 memorabilia collectors. The Carl Hungness has done a great job on this book and the photography is superb.
5,Delightful and heartwarming for all ages,"Written in the style of Dr. Seuss and beautifully illustrated, this charming story is sure to be a favorite of kids and parents alike. It is the tale of a young Snoodle who, while filled with child-like entusiasm, has little skill at the things he would do. When the older Snoodles make fun of him, he loses heart and decides to leave town and live alone. But he soon meets a mysterious stranger who shows him what he is really meant to be, and the little Snoodle flies off, no longer vulnerable to the taunts of others, but once again filled with the confidence and enthusiasm he was created with.This story is wonderful for kids facing discouragement or dealing with bullies. It shows them that their worth is not dependent on the opinion of others, but comes from somewhere else entirely. It also quietly makes them aware that they can use their own talents to do good things, or just to ""make others feel badly."""
1,Don't waste your money,The hypnosis portion is only 3 minutes of Dr. Rick Collingworth's Quit Smoking Volume 2 which is 43 minutes in length. I would recommend saving your two buck and puchasing the other. I've only listened to volume 2 once with no results yet but I will keep you all posted on my quest to quit smoking
2,Fur Flying Everywhere!,For $24.97 the boot isn't bad if you can get past the fact that the fur sheds everywhere. I had fur in my mouth and on the floor when I tried the boots on for the first time. I decided not to keep them.
1,Low Quality,"The subject matter is treated in respectful manner, however the presentation is lacking. Video was scratchy(copy of copy) and narration was less than informative. Tseng-Yun Xiang performed the T'ai Chi form quickly then showed each hand, foot and body positions slowly while performing the form again. Though emphasis seemed to be on form, the performer was often off-balance and making body adjustments during execution. Recommend beginners find another video or get a local instructor."
4,Great for Star Wars collectors.,"I am collecting Star Wars ornaments for a Star Wars themed Christmas tree. Wish these weren't so tiny, but I'm thinking of having a separate mini tree for the mini ornaments."
4,If you can keep up,"I am not good with dancing, but I ordered this to give it a try. I really like it, but it is cardio for sure...hard to keep up to but a good workout"
3,It's alright,"It is a fast paced video. So definitely not recommended for beginners, which is what I am. Hard to keep up with. And if you aren't a good dancer, which I am not then some of the moves are hard to do. Overall if you are already in good shape and have rhythm, then this is for you, if not pass it on by....."
4,I love this workout!,"Despite what everyone else says, I love this workout! I'm 22 years old, used to dance, and I think this is so much fun :) If you've done jazzercise before, it's a step up from jazzercise in terms of getting your heart rate up, and the moves are definitely not as cheesy as jazzercise.Another plus of this video is Allie DelRio Pointer, the instructor. Unlike a lot of other videos, her voice is not at all annoying - I actually like listening to her.The only downside of this workout is its length. I wish it were a little longer, but when you're short on time, this is great!"
1,Terrible!!!!,"I have to say that this work out is not for beginners instructor's pace is way too fast as if assuming you should know every step already, definately not ""easy to follow"" as shown on workout summary. I bought a pack of two of the firms workout DVDs and I feel very dissapointed they were both a waste of money!!!!."
1,not good,"I've been doing Zumba and thought I would try this, big mistake. This is hard to follow, overly complicated and not as good of a workout as I was expecting. I'm sticking with Zumba."
2,Graceless and Tricky,"Not my favorite video -- the dance style is full of abrupt movements and the instructor's cuing is very poor. I struggled to follow along, and felt very awkward. As other reviews have mentioned, quite a few of the moves are difficult to accomplish on carpeting."
3,"Fun, but not like other Firms","I bought the Transfirmer back in January, so when the new videos came out, I just had to try them. I was really excited about this video in particular. I enjoyed it and thought it was really fun, however, it definately did not get my heart rate up as much as the other Firm workouts. I will keep using this workout for more ""light"" days."
3,Not a strenuous workout at all,"I have been doing Firm workouts for over 10 years and bought this one to try something different. The dance moves were somewhat easy to pick up after a doing the video a few times. While I do feel you could get a decent workout from this video, it wasn't for me. I did break a sweat, but not enough to feel like I got a good workout. I think this would be best suited for a beginner who is just starting to workout and looking for something easy and not too strenuous."
5,awesome workout,I love this dvd. It's so much fun; the time just flies by. And it's a really great workout. It keeps your heart rate going the entire workout. People who like to dance or are tired of the step aerobics craze (or their knees are)will definitely enjoy this dvd. The instructor is peppy and cheerful.
1,cardio dance slim down,"Terrible video if you want to sweat and burn some calories! I have owned or own now all of the firm videos and I was very disappointed when I popped this into the player, prepared to sweat and get the same ""firm"" moves and sense of accomplishment at the end of the workout. I didn't even finish it. Way too slow and boring. Don't waste your money if you are expecting a true ""the firm"" video."
2,A disappointment...,"I love the FIRM workouts, and I love the instructor Allie, so I was so excited to try this new workout. I was unfortunately extremely disappointed.This workout was not complicated, but it also wasn't much of a workout. I didn't get my heart rate up at all, and didn't break a sweat. Some of the moves are just not very good, and having to repeat them everytime we add on got really annoying.The disco part was my favorite, but overall, this is a workout that I can honestly say I would rather have the money then the workout. I will keep it and periodically do it on a VERY light day or in addition to another workout, but that's just because I have it.I've tried a couple other of the new FIRM workouts that are more worth the money...this one I am sad to say is not."
5,Good Workout for a lighter day,"I will admit that this workout is not as intense as most of The Firm videos, but I think it is fun and energizing. I reach for this one on those days that I want to move and have fun, but I don't feel like doing anything overly exhausting. Some of the moves are a little silly, but I have fun with it still. If you are looking for a dance video that really burns calories and makes you sweat and is more dancy, try Allison's The Firm Cardio Dance Fusion - now that one will exhaust you!"
2,I didn't like it that much,I tried it once but I never got the motivation to try it for the second time. I didn't like the moves and the new moves came alittle bit too fast to learn.
2,Not for beginners!!!,"When I was shopping at WalMart, I was looking for some sort of upbeat workout video. When I saw this one, it ""appeared"" to be what I was looking for. It sounds fun and I thought it would have good music. When this lady gets into her dance moves, it appears she is teaching advanced dancers or advanced aerobic people. I couldn't keep up at all and was flopping all over the living room like a wild monkey. I think my son's Elmocize video would be better than this!"
4,Nice Change!!,"I found this to be a good workout to interject into my exercise rotation. It's fun and energetic. The routines are easy to learn as the instructor adds new moves. As with any exercise program, the more energy you put into it the more you'll get out of it. I work up a sweat every time."
3,NOT FOR ME.,"I've tried this DVD a couple of times and just am not enjoying it.I think part of it is, as a couple of other reviewers have noted, that many of the moves are hard to do on a carpeted floor. The moves are much more fluid on a hardwood floor.And many of the moves, imo, are just too silly for me; I think I just like a workout that's more functional and this one was not. I wish I could return it.btw, I love Allie del Pointer as an instructor and bought the DVD based on other workouts of hers; her timing is perfect and she's enthusiastic. It's not you, Allie, it's me! : )"
1,Disappointing,"This is the first time I have ever purchased a ""The Firm"" dvd. I was really disappointed in this one. Many of the moves are not properly explained. Some movements target only one side of the body and they don't bother having you switch sides to work the other. (really obvious in the salsa style section) It took a few times of doing to get all the moves right, but even after that it barely raises the heart rate. The warm up leaves much to be desired. The cool down continues the ""dance"" movements but at a ""slower"" rate and stretching the neck for one second on each side and the inner thigh for one second here and those are not enough to even make you realize that you are stretching. I am used to Denise Austin workouts, that are half the length but you actually feel like you did something when you are done. Not so with this ""workout"" at all. Definately a waste for someone who isn't just starting out."
1,Christmas Gift,"I love to dance and have taken several cardio dance classes before, so I wanted a dance workout video for my house. I did not pick it out, but I got it for christmas. I just tried it out and turned it off after 16mins. The music is horrible and not up beat. The dance moves do not follow the music. They go way to fast through the moves for you to even figure out what they are doing. I know it's not a dance instruction video, but all of the other workout videos I've done go through the moves a couple times to make sure that you get it and this one does not. You're better off dancing around on your own to music that you like. It is very frustrating and a waste of money."
4,Great!,"I really loved this book, but was a little bummed out on the end. I'm too much of a romantic and wanted her with a different guy. ^_^ What can I say, I want to have my cake and eat it, too! Storyline was really good through and I was on pins and needles for the character the entire time. I also loved the memories of the past. Very enticing!"
1,Don't waste your time or your money.,"This series started out good, but Daniels completely lost touch with the characters, especially Alex..... what the hell happened to him?? He suddenly became this evil, blood thirsty villian. He was fine in the first one, but then he became moody and abusive in books two and three. The ending was predictable, and frankly I was hoping Holly and Jason would get axed. But of course, it didn't happen....."
4,Girls out Late,girls out late is a very interesting book ot is about three very different girls that are friends growing up. ellie one of the girls loves to draw and and she went to the mall one day and she saw a guy in 11th grade and she fell in love just like he loved her! he was so interesting to see how 2 totally different people can make such a great couple! you sould definatly go read GIRLS OUT LATE ~~ BY JACQUELINE WILSON~~
3,book reveiw on girls out late,name of the book: girls out lateauthor: jacqueline wilsondate of book when made: 2003age recommendation: 10+appetite of the book: the book is good in someparts.opinions: This book is good because it is funny the story has different chapters and each chapter is about a different day of their life.The book is aboutthree girls who go out late and one girl who is fat gets a boyfriend. Each chapter is different and is about a different day of their life and then the other two get a boyfriend.
5,Very Nice Camera Mount,"This mount was exactly what I was looking for.The build quality could not have been better. It's made of very nice high quality metal, plastic and rubber. I have no worries about mounting my high end Nikon DSLR or Sony Hidef camcorder to this mount.This mount has it's own built in pump and fool proof feature that will warn you if the mount is getting ready to loose it's suction.I have had no problems with the mount loosing it's grip on several types of surfaces.Another great thing about this mount. It's made in America!I also recieved this mount in just a few days after ordering."
3,You Will Get Horrible Rolling Shutter With This.......,"I wish i could give this a really good 5 Stars But to be honest it falls just a little shortThe Good Thing about this is the price and the the fact that it supports the DLSR i have a T2i and the suction on this is incredible, but the only problem is when you attach this to a car, and ride the littlest bump in the road will show in your footage, i live in chicago so we are known for alot of Horrible roads so i find alot of the footage unusableim going to upgrade to a StickyPod because from what i see it has shock absorbers in them which is pretty good but this product falls a tad bit short , its good for a budget film maker , and if you wanna fix the rolling shutter shakyness in post but thats it tho"
5,Check it out!,"Yup, this is one of the best books I have ever seen on the (often ignored) subject of encouragement. On the down side, the book is written toward the Christain viewpoint (I'm a member of the Church or Religious Science), so reading this book took several extra hours as I ""translated"" it into secular language. But, it was well worth the effort! I am going to order some of Larry's other books."
1,a waste of time and money,"this book is so deeply biased and prejudiced against its main subject (Werner Heisenberg) that it cannot be taken seriously even for the few relevant things it has to say. Moreover the author is so aggressive (almost violent)against what he calls ""german culture"" (this label already suggests a lot) that his criticism borders on cultural racism. I deeply regret the time and money I spent in reading and buying this book."
1,Flawed,"Supposedly the author is a historian, however, nothing in terms of research method has been applied; this is a work of journalism, and very much on the simplistic side.The book contains some very selective use of sources, to prove the objective stated at the onset (in preface): That Heisenberg was morally corrupt, and at that a representative for German culture.It does not get more advanced than that in the rest of the book, so one can basically stop reading after the preface."
1,oh puhleeze...don't waste your $$$,"R. Rose has a personal axe to grind and it distorts this entire book. His attempt to be a ""historian"" is undermined by any serious attempt to look at the evidence and to use objective facts to guide his interpretation. No serious historian would ever endorse this book and it is fatally flawed by Rose's bias."
4,Controversial and fascinating,"Whether or not you agree with the author's conclusions, Rose's book provides a response to Powers's""Heisenberg's War,"" and provides material which was not available to Cassidy in ""Uncertainty..."" Some of the material, such as the supposed antisemitic rant by Heisenberg in the presence of Max Born, I found barely credible, due to a reliance on second hand sources.Nevertheless, Bohr's post war coolness toward Heisenberg as well as Heisenberg's failure to honestly confront the evil of the Nazi regime after the war are evidence that Rose's negative view of Heisenberg is closer to the truth than Powers's mostly positive one. I would strongly urge those interested in Heisenberg and the other German physicists of that era to purchase both the Rose book and the Powers book, and then to decide for themselves."
4,¡Puro sonido caleño!,"Son de Cali's pedigree (Grupo Niche) is illustrious and it shows with this album - their first, but in no way the that of debutants.Great warm salsa de Cali - great for dancing at parties!"
1,"Terrible, non-scholarly, an embarassment","This book is a joke. And I am an atheist who does not believe the jesus of the gospels was an actual historical person. I am a fan of the masterful work of Earl Doherty, Robert Price, Randel Helms, etc. -- these men are geniuses. Their work is scholarly. This book was a MAJOR disappointment. It makes all kinds of claims, but has no support, evidence, or basic footnotes for back-up. For example, it says all these things about Krishna -- but gives no references. What story is the author erefring to? What text? When was it written? Every claims in this book is like that -- totally unstubstaniated. Don't waste your money. It is a very enticing book from its title, but it is a real dud."
2,Dull,"I honestly thought it would be better, but it wasn't. There are only a handfull of great songs... I was a little dissapointed."
1,Quite possibly the worst book I've read....,"There may be worst books in the universe, but I haven't found them.The lack of editing and guidance is so obvious it's almost comical.One sentence sticks out:She adored him, as Cuban men lived to be adored.The story line is plausible, but the writing is just plain awful. There is little sentence structure and nothing to hold it all together.The fact that the author himself has reviewed the book right here at amazon.com should give a reader the first clue.Find something else to do...this book is a waste of time."
1,I'm objective...it's pretty bad.,"I read this book and found it lacking in almost everything a book should have. The author's writing style was pretty clumsy. He didn't really have a handle on dialogue. His paragraphs were jerky. He didn't really develop his characters and some of the descriptions were pretty weak.The story was interesting enough, but the author just couldn't support it.In reference to the book club: I wouldn't recommend this book to my group. It's just not good enough.And I, for one, find the author's blantant self-promotion of reviewing his own work a bit over the top."
1,"The worst, really","A book club friend reviewed this one for us. The review was pretty bad, but I asked for her copy of the book anyway.I noticed that the publisher is one of those places where the author pays to have his work printed. I can see why.It's pretty bad. The premise is good, but the writing is just plain awful. I could never recommend this book to anyone."
2,My Review,"One of my fellow book club members lent me a copy to read and I must say that parts of the book were so bad, sometimes I just had to laugh out loud. The idea for the plot is not bad, though - maybe the author can re-publish it after running a grammar check on it and getting rid of his weak attempts to sound ""ethnic"" (like spelling kill 'keel', which I found annoying).The reason I'm giving this 2 stars is (1) for the effort and (2) there were a few parts that were OK [Estenio's journal, for example)"
2,An attack on masculinity disguised as an attack on logic,"Although it may not be immediately evident, the real theme of this book is to discredit rational and logical thought processes by linking them with Hitler via Weininger and Wittgenstein. The idea is that masculinity is essentially evil and leads to all sorts of horrors such as rational and logical thinking, which somehow lead to the Holocaust. This discourse is part of a much larger one in which science is the ultimate bugaboo. This sort of thing goes at least as far back as the Romantics (""ye murder to dissect""), but in this case is mixed in with the idea that gay men and women are on the side of illogic and unreason, and are therefore the good guys in the war against linear thinking of any sort, which is seen as a product of male heterosexuality. In short, this book is nonsense."
4,Excellent value at $20,Book includes many exploded view drawings in support of lucid text to clearly show the location of bolts etc.. It saves hours and broken parts by this means; e.g. removal of plastic face/frame on 1990 Eldorado dashboard shows the precise location of (7) retaining screws. Those who want more details probably need the $100 shop manuals.
2,air conditioners no schematic on the a/c electrical,I have a 1991 Cad.Seville with an elec. short in the air conditioner. I cannot trace the circit. I bought the book part #8420 everything is covered in detail but the air conditioner electrical. The a/c clutch is not even shone. I had to pay for the book before I could unwrap it and then the info. I needed wasn't there and I am very unhappy with it.hvan
2,"No flood, but no water either...","I've started replacing my flood safe hoses with non-flood safe ones. I've never had a SS hose break, though thought the flood safe was a cool idea. I've had to remove the source end of the hose several times on different units because the hose thought there was a flood. Only way to get it out of flood safe mode is to turn water off and disconnect it, let the air in, then reconnect it. A pain!"
4,Amazingly Clear Presentations Of Boogie Woogie Music From Old 78's.,"Boogie Woogie Piano: Jimmy Yancey, Pete Johnson, Meade Lux Lewis, Albert Ammons.This collection of old Boogie Woogie songs originally recorded between 1936 and 1944 on 78 rpm records are amazingly clear, with very few scratchy sounding songs, and some songs have fidelity approaching that heard on later LP's. The recording technology of the day doesn't allow for the range of sound frequencies heard on modern albums, but it is quite good just the same. I don't know how they managed it, but as a listener I am grateful that this music has been preserved in such good condition. Listening to this album, I cannot decide which piano player I prefer. The songs I like best are: 1.) Yancey Stomp (Jimmy Yancey), 4.) Dive Bomber (Pete Johnson), and 18.) Bass Goin' Crazy (Albert Ammons). Worth buying."
2,Broke During First Use,"I had low expectations when I first bought these oars, but I expected them to last longer than what they did. I took a casual trip around a local lake and the connecting piece on one of the oars cracked within the first twenty minutes. These were basically a complete waste of money since now I must buy a more expensive pair on top of this one to replace that one. Cheap price but very cheap quality also."
2,Prone to snapping,I used these in combination with my coleman raft. After 3 trips out the plastic part in the center that hold the top half and the bottom half together snapped.I guess you can't expect too much for $8
5,Deserves the full 5 stars +++++,"As the title indicates, this is mainly a photographic atlas. However, it is an excellent introduction to trilobites for anyone interested in paleontology, no matter what their educational level."
4,Makes a Great Gift for Kids Interested in Science,"because, like Watson's ""Double Helix,"" it shows the structure of discovery & the passion behind it."
4,Twilights Child,"This was a pretty good book. I'd have to say that I am enjoying the 4th book better than this one. But, it's still worth reading. It's just that in all V.C. Andrews books I realize that her characters although have different names, they seem to all be the same person on the inside. there is always a Mean person like a grandmother and a mom that is light headed and some kind of incest that happened and because of that incest there is someone who hates the person born from it. Its always the same all story with a differnt plot. But, I guess I keep buying it because I have nothing else better to do. I never buy these full price or new, I always check a half priced or used book store instead."
2,Good Trash Reading,"Overall, it was fun reading, but really. Come on. You can't get much more corny than with lines like ""Sorrow, like sour milk, always seemed to come back up."" Stay with ""Flowers in the Attic"" and ""My Sweet Audrina"", Andrews' best works."
4,Dawn finally grows up...,"Twilight's Child is my favorite volume from the Cutler series. It isn't a mere transitional book. There is an emotional custody hearing, two elaborate weddings, despondency so bad that it causes a death, a jealous psycho's violent revenge, the birth of twins (of course), a creepy persistent obsession with a half-sister, and an extortion attempt by a sleazy ex-lover. And more. Best of all, Dawn has finally grown from a whiny airheaded starstruck kid into the assertive and competent owner of the Cutler's Cove hotel. No longer gullible, she risks Jimmy's resentment by exposing long-lost Fern for the no-good little schemer she is...and by the last chapter, a long-awaited dream comes true."
3,Don't read if tired,"This book is so boring. I skipped the last half of it. I adored the first two novels, but this was merely a transitional novel. Read the summary somewhere online and just go onto Midnight Whispers and Darkest Hour. Don't waste your time."
5,GREAT!~ [4 1/2],This was ANOTHER good one not as good as Secrtes Of The Morning or Dawn but still good!
4,Not too shabby,Great table. One of the chairs was hard to put together due to the fact the one of the dowel rods was not beveled like the others. Shipping was incredible. Order on the 19th delivered on the 20th. Great price. Solid wood table.
1,Paid too much!,"I shopped around the internet for a while to find just the right size and color table and chairs to fit my kitchen. This one looked great. It arrived within a week and without a scratch. However, while assembling the chairs I began to question the quality, especially considering the price. The wooden parts were a little unmatched and I had to make some ""adjustments"". The seat cushions were all padded differently and completely uneven, but I got the set together and looks ok. However (again), the very next day I happen into a Roses department store (kinda like Big Lots) and see the exact same set for...$125! I will do more foot work next time I buy some furniture."
1,Junk,This was the worst peace of junk I ever bought. The table is nice but the chairs fell apart in less then a week. Unless you only weigh 50lbs or less the the chairs suck.
3,Rewatching the BBC trailers is a pain.,"I bought the Dracula DVD because it was one of the better versions of the Bram Stoker classic. My opinion hasn't changed, it's still one of the best adaptations of Dracula story that I've ever seen. There is one down side to the DVD. Someone at the DVD manufacturing plant thought (?) it would be a good idea to put a bunch of BBC trailers ahead of the movie. You have to watch these trailers whether you want to or not, every time you que up the DVD you get to watch those @#%&! trailers again. There's no way that I can find to avoid doing so with my machine. Hence, I don't watch the DVD as much as I probably would if I didn't have to be a captive to this misguided marketing tactic. (That some moron has put on this otherwise excellent DVD.) My best to the #@%&*! moron responsible for doing that to us buyers."
3,Meh...not so great,"I was excited to watch this, but it simply wasn't all that good. If Jane Austen wrote Dracula and then it was turned into a PBS production you would end up with well...this. The director opted for the suave non-monstrous, romantic looking Dracula as opposed to Stoker's creepy old vampire, they did away with Lord Godalming, and the made Mina and Lucy sisters. I guess I just expected more from a BBC production."
3,"Louis Jourdan really ""Sucks""","Ever since viewing this on PBS years ago, I've wanted a copy. It didn't disappoint. Fairly true to Bram Stoker's novel, Jourdan is a smooth as silk, sinister Dracula. Could have been a better transfer to dvd."
3,Faithful but dull adaptation,"Bram Stoker's Dracula has been filmed many times but rarely are the adaptations completely faithful to the novel. This version, made for BBC in the late 70s, actually follows the book closely. That said, it isn't very entertaining or imaginative. The production values (sets, photography) are inconsistent and quite dull. The worst part of all is Louis Jourdan's lackluster impersonation of the Count who comes across as neither passionate or menacing. The same goes for the supporting cast. A few scenes are well done, particularly the one with Dracula climbing down the castle wall (this was also done in the Francis Ford Coppola version) but for the most part, the effects and creativity are woefully lacking here."
5,THANK YOU!,"Thank you for FINALLY making this available. I remember it with great pleasure when it first came out on PBS, and watched it for 3 years running on HALLOWEEN. I'll be the first to agree that the technology wasn't the greatest...but personally, I watch a movie for the acting...not digital effects. I literally grew up with horror films, and I can tell you that only TWO gave me nightmares. Bela Lugosi as Dracula, and Louis Jourdan as Dracula. They scared the stuffing out of me!Please give this one a chance...Jourdan is masterful."
4,Teacher's View,"My ELL English class just read Dracula, and I wanted to show the class the movie version. This version really holds true to the original novel, with splashes of dramatic license that I used to stimulate class discussion. Plus, it is a PG version, so I had no qualms about sharing it with my students. The only draw back is that it is LONG, but my students really liked it (even the creepy 70s music and effects), so it kept their attention."
5,Best rendition of Dracula,Very eerie good telling of Bram Stoker's Dracula. Saw this many years ago on PBS and it scared the Bejezus out of me. Louis Jordan is great- very creepy Dracula. The storyline follows the novel very well as only the BBC could do. I waited all through the VHS years and into the days of DVD for this to be released. Glad to see it once again.
3,MMAGAH,"This version of Dracula is fairly entertaining; however, its bad musical score--which I would consider a sound effect rather than a sound track--diminishes the movie's effectiveness. With a nice orchestral score this would be a much better movie."
1,Rent This One From the Library,"While some reviewers clearly enjoyed this film when they first saw it on TV (I can only assume they were quite young at the time), I found it unspeakably dull and disjointed. And (to echo another reviewer) I also deeply resent the BBC's practice of forcing home-viewers to sit through endless promotional commercials for other BBC series before watching the film they paid to see. One is not allowed to skip the commercials nor to fast-forward through them. This kind of intrusive, strong-arm tactic is not advertising. It's bullying. Commercials and promotions should be available as a Menu Selection."
1,Huge disappointment,"This mini series are a huge disappointment because of fake-looking background. Also, the acting is more like a play on stage than a movie. There's no horror and no suspense. There's nothing worth watching here. Luckily, I borrowed this DVD from the local library instead of buying it."
2,Cheesey for today's standards,"I saw this when it was first shown on tv as a mini serie. I remembered loving it. But cinematography has come along way since then. And now it just doesn't work. Also, with so many vampire chracters (actors) since then, today Louis Jordan just doesn't cut it as Dracula. Still, it's worth watching if just to see how far we've come in films."
1,Worst Ever Made,"I was sucked in by all the 5 star reviews. I wouldn't have given it 1 star but that is there are no negative stars. I love Dracula movies and thought I had seen them all. I was very excited to see a 5 star mini-series from BBC. This has to be the worst! Poor acting, bad filming and incredibly slow. Don't waste your money, there are so many more, much better. Try the one with Frank Langella if your looking for an older classic, even Bela Lugosi is better."
4,Good Overview - Needs Index,"This guide to hip hop by Peter Shapiro is an excellent source for those new to hip hop or looking to expand their hip hop horizons. Shapiro's writing style is concise, approachable, steeped in aspects of hip hop history and occasionally opinionated. Some of his reviews should be taken with a grain of salt, as he explicitly states he's continuing the hip hop tradition of sparking debates and causing beefs (did he just forget to include Puff Daddy? probably not, sorry P. Diddy). One thing pointed out in some other reviews that really needs some attention - the lack of an index combined with often confusing placement of artists. Take Quasimoto... would that be placed under Quasimoto? Madlib? Stones Throw Records? Actually, none of the above... it's under L for Lootpack/Madlib. Some of this treasure hunting leads to fun exploration, often it's just plain annoying. So four stars for the lack of index, but overall still a recommended guide."
4,Chris Murray does it again,"Hey! This newest CD from Chris Murray is awesome! Nice ska sounds, incredible lyrics, special guest appearences (specifically Neville Staple from legendary '80s ska band ""The Specials"" and 2 members from Hepcats). This CD was recorded entirely on a walkman, which gives it a real raw sound (incredibly, the best sounding song is one of Chris' classis; Rocksteady, it was recorded live). It gives a feeling of privacy, as if Chris Murray was there singing only for you.My only disapointement was that it was only Chris and a guitar, compared to his other CDs where ther was the occasional piano, bass and drum.All in all, this CD is definately worth your money!"
5,"It may be Raw, but it won't make you sick.","I bought this CD on a whim, but it has turned out to be one of my absolute favorites. Chris Murray is a phenomenal writer and musician, and this album doesn't try to hide him behind extra instruments or technology! If you're not sure whether or not to buy this CD, just go for it. Well-worth the $10!"
3,good but....,"while this is a wonderful book and is absolutely haunting, it (i believe) cheats the reader out of the ending. the happy ending supplied by the author is inauthentic and detracts from the story.however, the alternating chapters are heart-wrenching and what this boy went through was absolutely devestating. kids should know about the atrocities of the past, however bad."
5,Great for energy!,I have noticed after taking two of these capsules that I feel much more energetic afterwards. It seems to 'wake me up' good! Usually tribulus is talked about for men but apparently women can take it as well. From my own research (internet surfing) it raises womens estradiol level. I have not started growing any beards or any questionable lower area appendiges and I've been taking it for a year now.
5,Great information book.,Got this for a friend to give as gift. She had hardback copy and loves it. She is giving to daughter in law.
2,Not the greatest cover I've ever heard...,"I guess most people don't realize that Blue Monday is a New Order song from 1983. I wasn't too impressed with Orgy's cover of it. The music sounds almost the same, but the vocals are too metal sounding. This was originally a dance song, and, in my opinion, it was far better done by New Order."
3,good songs...poor remixes,"Blue monday and Stitches are well known songs by Orgy that are featured on this CD. Stitches is a song that literally changed my outlook on certain things due to its exquistie lyrics and beautiful video. Blue monday is also a great song and is much better than New Order's version. If you are a ""single"" fan and only likes Orgy's single ""Blue Monday"" than I strongly advise you to buy this CD. However, if you are more interested in the complete works and talents of Orgy, buy their album. This CD basically takes Blue monday and Stitches and remixes them into poor sounding noise. So, basically... Orgy's songs are wonderful but the mixing isn't necessary. Buy their album that will reflect Orgy's true beauty and talent."
2,"Song is o.k., remixes are completely stupid","I think this is just the attempt of a mediocre talented industrial-rock band to get some promotion for their album. I don't know what you'd expect from a ""Blue Monday"" cover version, but in my opinion this an acceptable re-make of this classic New Order song. The painful and desperate atmosphere of the original version is transformed into something aggressive and angry. It sounds very ""'90s"". But what about the remixes? They're completely uninspired, neither danceable nor listenable."
2,"umm, what??","okay, so the song ""Blue Monday"" is pretty cool, but i bought the single cuz i really liked the song ""stitches"", and instead there is some crappy remix of it.. save your money, and buy the cd"
4,Single's called BLUE MONDAY...,"This single sux! I hope the ""STITCHES"" single has better remixes than Blue Monday. I only gave it 4 stars becuz it plays the video when you put in you computer! All five Blue Monday remixes suck. And for the stitches mix, what the hell is it? Sounds nothing like Stitches! Buy this, only for the video."
2,a nice song and its lousy remixes,"First - I LOVE ""Blue Monday."" I love what they did with the New Order's outdated original. This is one of the best songs to listen to on a joyride in my car on Lake Shore Drive... The video was a nice bonus as well.However, what's up with these lousy remixes? The themes of the remixes seem to have no actual meaning in these remixes, and instead of the dynamic, emotional rollercoaster ""Blue Monday"" is, what you end up is mindless techno beats that is totally unsatisfactory.Skip this single - go for the full album."
2,"Ok, but.....","....this song can't hold a candle to the original, period. New Order's ""version"" (I love when people refer to the original as New Order's ""version"" of the song, as if Orgy originated it) was revolutionary. It is the all time best selling 12"" record, and even 16 years later still sounds futuristic, so I have a hard time agreeing with anyone who things Orgy ""modernized"" the song. IMHO, clearly they didn't improove it....they changed the instrumentation, that's all...they certainly did not add anything to the song. Even Orgy's version sounds pretty nice, but from my perspective its because they started out with a song/concept that was so brilliant to begin with, even butchering it to the extent they did still leaves something pretty good."
4,a great read,"This is an easy fascinating read by an incredibly eloquent writer. He had interesting insights on the major forrign policy issues of the last 50 years. Not knowing all the details to many of these events, Mr Eban does a great job of suummerizing the events in a short but helpful fashion.This is a must read for anyone interested in how foreign policies are formed. Loved the section on the inherent contradiction between what is good for he country vs what is good for oneself."
4,Not Essays but OK,"There are two duds in this book, the one about a college in the dessert, that I'm not sure even exists, but whatever, and the one about museums. But after that I think it's an intersting twist on what 'essays' mean. okay"
2,hermits are suppose to write well,"Let me give you the scoop on John D'Agata. I am a student of the Writer's Workshop at the University of Iowa. Before I came I made a point to read everyone's books. I haven't had John D'Agata as a teacher and haven't even seen him yet because he's a freak and a hermit. But this is what I think about his ""brilliant"" book. Halls of Fame is D'Agata's first book, and you can tell it is. Now that the love fest with him seems to be over, I hope people will be willing to think about this book intelligently. It is a waste of paper. And definitely a waste of money. His ""essays"" ,if that's what you want to call them, are just hodge podges of bits of information and ""observations"" that are about as profound as a bowell movement. Just because a guy uses some ""experimental"" styles while writing in a conventinoal form doesn't make him a ""breakthrough!"" Get with it people. This is not a good book."
1,the spunwork of a boring artform enwebbed his very fans,"i think the reviews here are either written by d'agata's own family and friends or the writers are all delusional. perhaps they dodn't realize that the previous working titles to d'agata's ""masterpiece"" were PLAINWATER, THE AGE OF WIRE AND STRING, and A HEARTBREAKING WORK OF STAGGERING GENIUS. oh wait, those weren't the previous titles to his book, those are the books d'agata plagarized while writing this arrogant collection of nonsense."
5,The cutting edge of literature,"Warning: This book is not an easy read!But then again groundbreaking literature never has been...This is not for those who think that the personal essay is the only kind of essay there is or who think The Liars Club is an exemplar of great nonfiction or that last year's outrageously hyped Dave Eggers is what an experimental nonfiction writer might look like.This is for those readers who want to be challenged on every level of the reading, whether about the subjects the book treats or the styles it employs or the huge disarming issues it raises about the very nature of genre.In general, for anyone who wants a glimpse at what essayists a decade from now will be writing, you must definitely read this amazing first book!And if you get a chance to hear him in person read from this do it! I just heard this dude perform at my friend's school in Massacusetts and it was completely transportaive!Read it!"
5,Joan Didion Meets Generation X!,"Charged with authentic, raw, and unpretentious curiosity, D'Agata's exhilirating book is always true and good, touching and inventive, heartbreakling and even hilarious. He's sort of a Joan Didion for Generation X, but smart and surprising and wonderful enough for the adult set too. His subjects are American, not just MTV oriented, and his tone and style is rambuctious but respectful of readers. D'Agata's great story, however, the thing that ties the book together, is the writing of the book itself; sort of the writing of the essay itself actually--a long lost form that could very well make a come back thanks to this charming treatment by a young man who seems to be resurrecting it all on his own. Along the way are divorcing parents, cattle castrations, and even an adorable climb up the peak of the Luxor Hotel in Vegas so that he can turn on what he calls the brightest light in the world."
5,After Postmodernism Comes...?,"How does a young writer, trained under the big circus tents of postmodernism--but only AFTER postmodernism was already declared dead and buried--find a form and style and voice in the mushy contemporary American world of post postmodernism? HALLS OF FAME is one example. If one tendency of postmodern texts is that they promise coherence but then, in the end, intentionally fail to deliver on that promise, what John D'Agata does is not promise anything in his essays, but deliver anyway everything we could have hoped for in an essay. If you love essays and want to know what's happening right now in the form, this is a wonderful mix of the traditional and alternative in nonfiction."
3,Not KR's best......,"This was pretty classic KR.... However, it's not even close to her best work. I did like the characters in the book for the most part.... our heroine kinda got stupid once (that's a spoiler though, so I won't go there).My main problem with the book was that it was wayyyyyyyy too wordy... descriptive sentences were in most every paragraph.... got boring. I did like the plot it was kinda spine-tingling a couple of times.... but she didn't put as much effort into it as she could have & when she wrapped it all up I had everything figured out except the actual name of the killer (which was a nobody anyway). The conclusion was a let down for me. Also, I didn't much care for the love scenes.... they just weren't romanctic... nor did they raise my eyebrows (lol)- kind of just thrown in there, ya know? Anyway, diehard KR fans will probably want to go ahead & read it - but don't get your expectations up."
3,So annoying,"I have never hated 2 fictional characters the way I hated Matt and Carly. I found myself rooting for the killer! They just went back and forth, I couldn't even figure out why they were mad at each other half the time. I have loved all her other books but this one is just awful. One good thing about the book, I guess,is that I had strong feelings about the characters. THey were real, real annoying."
1,Cruelty to animals a big turnoff for me.,"I have read a few of Robards books and enjoyed them as page turners. There was one where a pig was a comic element and helped the main character survive an attack by the bad guy. Very clever use of the animal there. Whispers however starts out with a bad guy slashing a knife through a small helpless dog, leaving him bloody, etc. This I just don't need in my mind's eye. I would have thought Ms. Robards a better writer than to need to use animals in this way. Sadly I had already purchased it on my Kindle. Maybe I'll try another one of hers from the library, maybe not."
5,Wonderful Comedic Style,"Karen Robards delivers in this book: plenty of romance, suspense, and laugh-out-loud moments. The chemisty between Matt and Carly sizzles, and the ambiguity Matt feels over his love (and lust) for Carly great fun to read. Robards is one of my favorite authors, and I eagerly devour each book she writes."
4,I would like to meet Matt,"I am a very big fan of Karen Robards, so I thought this book was really good. Matt seemed to have a 6th sense that Carly, ""Curls"", was in trouble, and things would be good. It would have been nice for Matt's deputy to start a relationship with Carly's friend. This would have added more romance to the story. I would get tickled when the dog would bark, and give the mystery man away. Thank goodness for animals. If you want a book with sex, romance, humor, and mystery, then give this one a try. I have read all of Karen Robards books and have not been disappointed."
2,A big disappointment.,"I have read many Karen Robards books and I've liked most of them but his one is really a flop. The first fourth of the book deals with a cat and a lady chasing it. The plot is difficult to understand, what is the real conflict? She hates Matt, she is so rude. Then she loves him desperately, and then he proposes, and so naturally she says no, because it's our of pity. WOW, really. I normally get through a book in two readings but with this one I have been struuggling for over a week. A waste of time and money."
5,Whispers at Midnight,I read Whispers at Midnight and thought it very good and well written. I enjoyed it very much and like all the authors other books also.
2,When did Ms. Robards get so crude.........,"Ms. Robards used to be one of those authors I picked up by name alone. Not anymore.I want to know when Ms. Robards got so crude. It seems she has lost the meaning of the word romance. I do not consider the word f--k romance. She even tried to pass it off as a pray once. Give me a break. I also think ""No good, dirty, rotten, SOB"" used over thirty times a bit much.If your looking to capture the romance, try Ms. Robards earlier written historicals. She new how to write then."
5,"Fast, Romantic and Thrilling...Awesome read!",This was my first Karen Robards book and I really enjoyed the book. I am actually going to get another book by her. I love her story line and it actually kept my interest through out the entire book....another fast read for me!
1,Worst Romance I Have Ever Read,This was by far the worst book I have read in a long time and I after some of the ones I've read recently a book has to be pretty bad to fall into that category. Carly was the worst heroine that I have ever had a pleasure of reading. She is immature with the intelligence of a five year old. Matt wasn't much better because he was attracted to this dizzy woman. And if I had to read one more time that he was a dirty rotten SOB I was going to scream. I struggled as hard as I could to finish this awful mess because I purchased it but in the end I couldn't even do that. This is the first and the last book I will ever read by Ms. Robards.
1,No where near Ms. Robard's standards...,"This book was not one of Ms. Robards' best.For quality reading and an idea of Ms. Robards capabilities as an author pick-up the any/all of the following:Night MagicWalking After MidnightGhost MoonHunter's MoonThe end of the book left quite an opening for a sequel. Who know's, it may be worth reading."
2,Very contrived - to the point of being ridiculous!,"This is the first time I read this author and, if this is a sample of her work, it was very disappointing. Nothing rang true - not the ridculous storyline or the characters relationships with one another or especially the 'villian' and his story and how he amazingly even won the lottery!! This story was like scraps of ideas trying to be woven into a mystery. It did not work."
3,was cute.. worth the read.,"it was a fun, cute tale but definitely nothing amazing... i like some of her other contemporaries better, but I thought it was worth the read. The romance was believable and the suspense was not over the top cheesy."
3,Predictable but Readable,"This book was very engaging-I will give it that, but it was just missing a mere more sophistication. The teasing sex scenes are great, but they just all lead up to what is to be a very predictable conclusion. A very light, fast read if you feel like losing yourself in a little romance and heat and don't care that your mind may actually shrink, instead of expand once the book is done."
2,"They Sound Good, But.....","...I cannot get them to securely fit in my ears, they fall right out because of their shape. They are round, hard plastic, about the size of a dime. Dang, twenty bucks wasted."
2,not to my expectation,this one i expected quite a good sound quality before i bought reading fromrevies but did not make it enough to my expectation after listening comparing with SONY md series even basic MD model...bass is thin and others are quite OKies..treble and mid..less dynamic also...
1,MacDonald is guilty as charged (DNA proves more),"Forget any account on the case. You can read Fatal Vision, which may be somewhat more one-sided. However, by now the case seems clear. The DNA-evidence that has been asked for by the defense team showed that the hair in Colettes hands was 1. her own 2. that of Jeffrey MacDonald, the defendant. None of the hair found at the scene belonged to the so-called ""hippies"". Making this case clearer than ever. For more read about the case go to the Jeffrey MacDonald information page (where 1000s of documents and pictures are available in a scanned form)."
1,false book,"I read fatal justice years ago giving Macdonald the benefit of the doubt,after all who wants to admit that a father can butcher his own children? What I read was very one sided, and full of lies. I found a website which shows all evidence from the case and matched Macdonald's book to Fatal Vision on the website. The website showed more evidence that matched Fatal Vision to Fatal Justice in fact there was no evidence supporting Macdonald at all. He points fingers to innocent people who left no sign of ever being in his apartment in the first place, and shows no mercy to a woman who can't even recall what she did that night and was tormented by it for years! If you want to believe Macdonald's lies read it if you want the truth read Fatal Vision or Final Justice by the author of the website that shows the actual evidence.That's were you'll find the truth!"
2,I'm one of those people who believes he didn't do it,"But this book is too boring to convince me of anything, other than the apparent lack of an editor.Was Dr. MacDonald a good husband and father? By all accounts, no, and I'm not sure things happened the way he described, but I was once convinced he was guilty and now I don't think he is. Before flaming me, keep in mind that he's not going to be sprung because of my opinion.And who formulates their opinion of an event based on the TV movie about it, anyway? It was NOT a documentary!"
4,a factual believable account,"I would have given 5 stars but gave 4 just for the fact that it had to many reference throughout breaking up the flow.I read both ""fatal vision"" and ""fatal justice"" and found the ""Fatal Justice"" more factual. Yes, I agree it did not read as well but mainly because it was a much better researched book. I think that McGinnis sold out as was said in F.J., it makes sense when you think about it, he barely glosses over the lost prints, contaminated crime scene and especially the skin. I have to wonder how such prosecutorial misconduct can not be addressed and how the case can not be re examined.I am a big forensic shows fan and have to say the police are certainly error prone in most cases. If they get in their mind you are guilty they try to make the evidence fit their theories and not go where the evidence takes them. People judge people for getting a lawyer right away but I think that is the best advice for anyone!I hope that the case is reopened and the truth is told."
3,Blameless?,Almost three decades have past when the three members of the MacDonald family were annihilated. With Jeffrey MacDonald in jail this book insistent on his innocence sheds new light on the case. An interesting research into material which states that this man may be guiltless. My interest in this case made me read this book which shows facts and brings questions forth. I cannot say if this man is blameless or blameworthy. But the book shows his side of a foul play. Appealing for those interested in the case.
1,Waste of Time,"Okay, someone writes a book to attempt to prove MacDonald innocent. The writer makes lots of money just as McGinnis did with the first book Fatal Vision(which by the way is more entertaining to read.) But the facts of the matter are that MacDonald's appeals have all been turned down and every bit of new evidence has been rejected by the courts. And now his attorneys are trying to get a new trial based on what they say was a threat to MacDonald from a prosecutor. Sounds like grabbing at straws to me. The courts decide and they have found him guilty. Of course there are people who will cling to their belief that he is innocent. But then there are people who believe that Scott Peterson is innocent too. But they're not the courts so it doesn't matter. Skip this book, it's boring and nothing new is spectacularly revealed."
1,Ridiculous,"I realize this book has been out for a long time, but after seeing a recent show featuring MacDonald, I decided to read ""his version"" of the murders. The book misconstrues the facts of the case, while ignoring the real evidence that showed MacDonald to be the killer. I find it hard to believe that anyone would buy into this, except perhaps MacDonald groupies who refuse to see (or choose not to see) his guilt. Reading this book was a complete waste of time, and it angers me how the authors try to manipulate their readers into believing MacDonald's innocence. Prison is exactly where Jeffery MacDonald should be, and I hope this narcissistic sociopath is never released."
1,Guilty,"Read the book ""Fatal Vision"" if you want the more accurate account of what happened the night Jeff Macdonald's pregnant wife and two kids were brutally murdered. That book does have it's faults, but ""Fatal Justice"" is simply the rants of a convicted murderer (who is holding on to the hope that someone will buy into his story, and one day he will be free) combined with info on ""errors"" made and the conspiracy against him. Macdonald was convicted of three counts of murder nine years after the murders took place. While his wife and kids sustained brutal, fatal injuries from the ""acid crazed hippies"" Jeff claimed attacked all of them, he sustained nothing more than minor injuries- no fatal, major wounds were found on the man. Luckily the sociopathic cold-hearted doctor has waived his right for parole hearings since 1991 (his next chance is in May 2005) so that as of right now he is exactly where he belongs- rotting away in prison."
1,G. Dalton,"Hey everyone, Stay away from this video. It has been over a year since my first review and I am here to tell you that you are wasting your time and money on this video. Moreover, all of the reviewers listed (except me) rate videos by Mr. Lyons as great or good videos. Once again, these reviewers are either hired by Mr. Lyons or they are Mr. Lyons writing under an assumed name to promote his poor product. Don't be fooled!"
1,Don't Waste your Time or Money,"There were two major problems with this video. First, as a martial arts practioner, many of the items outlined were very much impractical. Second, the video itself was not a professional production; it looks as if it was shot on a home video camera. Personally, I would not waste my time on this video. If you are looking for practical self-defense, I strongly encourage you to look at tapes dealing with Akido, Jujitsu, or Hapkido."
3,Sigur on the radio,"Although these songs do not have too much to say, an eerie electronic layering can work wonders half-glanced as sonic wallpaper."
3,readable expository essay,"One's view of the book is dependent upon what one is seeking. Yes, it is a ""readable expository essay"" as proclaimed by the back cover. The essay is not peopled with the sort of narrative insight and entertaining draw into the human condition that we have become accustomed to in entertaining recent commentaries. It is scholarly and useful."
2,Travelogue,"Joni's final disc is a big disappointment. It is too over-produced. The overblown orchestration overwhelms so many songs and unfortunately comes over as predictable and unadventurous - far too many lush strings. ""Chinese Cafe"" & ""Cherokee Louise"", in particular, sound positively mawkish/ maudlin. Joni's voice is rich and powerful as ever though, but it is hardly cheerful. I can't imagine listening to it again very often - there is an air of depression to it. I am a huge Joni fan but prefer to keep the original versions to memory. Beautifully packaged boxed cd though, lets hope she changes her mind and releases a disc of new original songs one last time."
5,A journey worth taking...,"Travelogue is a collection of some of Joni's most lyrically and musically outstanding material reinterpreted through the use of a 70 piece orchestra with arrangements by Vincent Mendoza who worked on Joni's 2000 album Both Sides Now and last year's Vespertine by Bjork.Some of the highlights include The Dawntreader, The Sire of Sorrow (Job's Sad Song), Amelie, and Trouble Child among others.But whole cd really excells as a whole.Good job Joni! I hope this really isn't your last record."
4,"Did you like ""Both sides now""? you'll enjoy this one too !!!","I'm very biased when it comes to Joni Mitchell. For instance, ""Shadows and Light"" is THE desert island CD of my 1,000+ collection. and I have almost everything that she has recorded in her career. This CD is the next level of Joni's non-stop innovation journey, and yet is very much along the lines of the beautiful ""Both Sides Now"" from the year 2000.The version of ""Amelia"" is just extraordinary.If you are not very much into Joni, then I would not start with this one. It may look like a little bit repetitive and you may even think that a double CD has been a little bit of an overkill (despite the great quality of the edition, art, booklets, drawings, etc). But if you have been loyal to this lady -at least lately- you'll love this CD, even though big fans like myself may be missing the sound of the (late Jaco Pastorius' ) fretless bass in this version of ""Hejira"" and the inclusion of some key songs (i.e. ""Blue"")."
3,Not the Joni I know,"I'm a Joni fan, have been all my life it seems. I love the haunting, melancholic sound of her voice, the heart and soul she pours into singing her songs and the words that cut through to the bone. She is a true artist in every sense of the word. This album is a disappointment for me. The full orchestra depletes the feelings that always emanate from her songs and causes me to strain in order to make out the words that are overwhelmed by music that's too strong and oddly out of place for a folk singer. I'm left with a longing that isn't fulfilled in this album.My recommendations: skip this album and spend your money on Blue or Turbulent Indigo."
5,This is an extraordinary piece of music,The people who don't like these CD's simply haven't listened to enough good music. Great orchestration; great jazz playing; great singing; great writing....all done in a modern style; what a relief to have this beautiful piece of music at this time.
2,Why?,"Never thought I'd hear it. After listening to Joni's work since 1970, I am bemused at this offering. While the lush, smooth sounds from the orchestra do a fine job of interpreting Joni's work, they are simply that. It's not just Joni's words or music, but her arrangements that make her music what it is. This offering looses that Joni essence - regardless of her obvious influence in the production. I almost suspect that someone else could have recorded this CD with similar results. If Joni's voice, or any of the lyrics on this CD touches you, I can only suggest you listen to some earlier Joni (Blue, Ladies of the Canyon, Hyjera, and one of her most profound - Mingus). They'll change your life, this one won't."
3,Slightly better than no new Joni...,"Let me say from the outset that I'm a huge Joni Mitchell fan. Whether you're a big fan or not, if you liked 2000's ""Both Sides Now,"" you'll probably like this. If not (I didn't), you probably won't. The orchestrations, musicianship and package are outstanding, but the songs sound rather lifeless. I prefer the originals (by far) in every case. Still, new Joni - even if it's re-working old Joni material - is better than no new Joni."
2,Lugubrious,"Lugubrious.'Nuff said!It's gorgeous, but it's also just dog-dreary mournfully overblown.Sometimes that's what you want, though, so give it a listen. ...But...it's gorgeous.It might be just what you need. So, give it a shot...(I will take my local public library's copy back tomorrow, with no regrets.)"
2,What on Earth Was She Thinking?,"She ransacked her music, turning it into kitsch more adroitly than most hack cover-artists could have done. Wasn't anyone around to tell Joni that less is more? The best thing are her paintings, reproduced in the insert. They are spare. The musical arrangements are unbelievably pretentious and self-indulgent. The lapse of her characteristic taste is astonishing. For that reason, the CD has some interest, perverse interest. This is a side of Joni that maybe we really didn't want to know about. Unlike what some people say about her music in her early singer-songwriter days, this recording really is embarrasing to listen to. Graceful retirement, please."
2,An Unfocused Mess,"I love Joni to death, but find this album just plain unfocused and messy. Many of the obscure and ""undiscovered"" tracks revisted her from Don Juan and Mingus remain as contrived and just plain weird as the original recordings. Also, instead of enhancing the material, the orchestral arrangements tend to suck the life out of the songs, the result being great classics such as Hejira and The Sire of Sorrow feel weighed down and hampered. Also, I don't feel Joni's sincerity on this release. Only on the last song, ""The Circle Game,"" did I connect with the music, and feel she had truly ""recreated"" one of her songs. Not worth the price of admission, though."
1,"Hey Joni, Have Another Carton Of Cigarettes!!","Three words: Save Your Money. It's hard to believe thesestrained croakings emanate from a woman who once had sucha gorgeous voice. I know there are zillions of fans whowill disagree, but listening to this album is too painfulfor me. Joni may be bursting with creativity and greatideas, but you have to wonder about someone who has destroyedtheir vocal cords on purpose with a lifetime of chain-smoking.I think her next CD should be a tribute to Tom Waits, sinceshe is sounding more and more like him. Pitiful!"
1,No Buried Treasure Here,"I am having a difficult time enjoying Travelogue. Here was an opportunity for Joni to breath new life into her past body of work, but instead she has created a very morose and maudlin affair that has induced serious yawning and boredom.Since about 1994, there has been a campaign going to convince the public that Joni Mitchell is a genius, a misunderstood artist whose work, like that of Van Gough, will only be appreciated after her passing. Like with previous recordings, on Travelogue, I've valiantly tried to convince myself of her genius, to really see into the music, but I just don't buy it. I'm tired of digging for buried treasure, when there probably isn't any to find. A seriously overrated artist who fills the niche for people wanting to believe they are listening to inspired music. Sammy Davis Jr. is more inspired than Joni mitchell"
2,Too basic,"Recipes were too basic and uninspiring. If this is the first time you've looked at anything about kids' cooking, then maybe it would be OK. I was looking for something more exciting."
1,Where did the video go?,"This VHS video was sent to me in April 2002 and it never arrived. Perhaps it was unwise to order it because there was a possibility that due to system differences in the US and in Europe I may not have been able to view the contents in any case. But now, it wasn't even possible to try it out! So, I can provide no ranking with the stars, and will stick to just one (but not because I think it bad, I just haven't been able to view it)."
3,LesserEvil Maple Pecan Popcorn,"Tastes good, but a bit on the sweet side. Would be better with pecans, and I would like it better in the individual size as well. *note to self*"
1,Too Sweet,"Yuck. I know, others said ""it's too sweet"" in their review. But I didn't believe them, I thought ""that's why I'm buying it"". But believe me, real maple syrup (and that is what they use) is too sweet. Could barely give it away at work, but of course there are some people who will take anything if it's free. And to top it off, they quit making the sinnamon I guess, now that was GOOD!!!"
2,Funny tasting,I love popcorn & the taste of maple. This popcorn just tasted 'off' however. It left a unappealing aftertaste. I gave a box to my neighbor who is a popcorn fanatic. She declined another box.
3,FYI The ratio listed is for FULL SCREEN not Widescreen,I almost bought this but luckily I double checked the ratio. They list is as 1.33:1 which is 4:3 standard. So if you prefer the picture to fit your regular television screen then this set is for you. If you would prefer to see the whole picture (or at least a lot more of it) then look for DVDs with a better ratio. For a definition and examples of different ratios check out this page on Wikipedia [...]
2,Disappointment for someone who loves period dramas,"Shakespeare in Love won a number of academy awards including Best Picture and I was really looking forward to viewing this DVD since I didn't see it when it played the movie theaters. I expected much more than the film delivered. I do not believe this movie reflects the talent and abilities of the actors cast to play in it. My biggest problem was in the literary license of the screenwriter in his fabrication of the inspiration for Romeo and Juliet and Twelfth Night by William Shakespeare.I bought the two movie DVD since I enjoy Gwyneth Paltrow and have seen her in some excellent films. This version is not one of her best and my BBC versions of Emma are much better. If I had it to do over, I would not have bought this double feature DVD."
5,Great Sound from HK,"What could be better than quality sound from a major audio brand name. These speakers offer plenty of sound, clean sound, and can take lots of power from a high power reciever. These speakers can take between 10-80 watts based on the HK fact sheet, and the sub is 100 watts, powered, 10 inches, which plugs into it's own electrical outlet. The speakers are sleak, not too large in terms of the satelites, but the sub is larger than it looks in the photo. This is not going to fit NEXT to your TV as the smaller HTIB system subs might, it needs it's own corner of the room.High quality, and when connected to an HK AVR reciever, it works like a charm. I have it connected to the AVR 240, and once again amazon provided great prices on both.enjoy!"
4,Price is right,I would advise getting the 1/4 gr tablets for extra sweetness flexibility.Two 1/2 tablets make my typical mug of coffee a bit too sweet.
2,What am I buying?,I am not a Mahjong playe. My wife is. I wanted her to have a reference book on American version. I thought this would be good. Little information available on books contents and objectives except the usual hype about how we cannot get along without it. The book was very difficult to figure out. I still don't know whether or not it can be used for the american version of the game. It was poorly written and organized. I sent it back and paid for the return shipping. I will want more details when I buy another. Maynard
2,Not what I was looking for,"I returned this book after hoping that it would complement the Mahj Jongg lessons I took about a year ago. Unfortunately, it didn't. There was way too much on scoring. Scoring was not part of my instruction, so it wasn't a fit for me. I'll continue to look for a book that is directed at American Mahj with chapters on strategies and how to decide which hand to play with the tiles you have."
4,"Useful, Comprehensive and Readable","A good introduction to the game for beginners, with strategy advice that will be useful to more experienced players as well.Whitney explains clearly and concisely, using easy to understand diagrams. She even manages to explain Mah Jong's rather complex scoring system, which can be a bit off-putting for beginners.Her inclusion of the differences between Japanese and American rules is also quite helpful, although I've found that as with any game, some of the rules and terminology vary from region to region.All in all a good book for those looking to begin playing Mah Jong, particularly those in Japan or with Japanese friends."
3,Not for National Mah Jong league play,"This book says it has a section on American mah jong and alternate rules, but none of it has anything to do with what is played at National Mah Jong league games. The title should specify that. It is useless to me now, but this version of the game sounds very interesting and challenging. My star rating is meaningless, too, since I don't know how to play japanese mah jong and have no one to practice with."
3,Doesn't focus on Japanese Rules,"This book contains a lot of Mahjong goodness, but I wish the Japanese Mahjong rules were covered better. If you are looking for primarily Japanese rules, for example you want to get better at Janryumon 3, then keep looking."
3,Good Songs; Irritating Vocals,"This Irish trio ups the tempos on their second release, I to Sky, and the new speed makes their hyper-emotional juvenilia signify more deeply than on their debut. Problem is, Mark Greaney has also upped the vocal register. His shrieking tenor now sounds like Chipmunks on acid. The songs themselves are stellar, especially the rollicking ""Formulae"" and the incendiary ""I Saw a Prayer"". So I won't blame the material on the low repeat potential of I to Sky - just the producers, Flood and Alan Moulder, neither of whom have ever met a filter or an echo machine they didn't like. And who certainly urged Greaney to scream like Jimmy Somerville on rock night at the gay bar."
1,Broke during second use,"I'm not sure a retractable plug can possibly be very strong, but I didn't get a chance to find out, since the second time I plugged this in, the computer didn't recognize it. Nor did numerous other computers. Sandisk was pretty helpful when I called their help line 1-866-726-3475, and I think they will replace it. But it seems the problem has something to do with it being made of Titanium, and it happens enough that they're not surprised. For these reasons, I would recommend one of their other (non-Titanium, non-retractable) Flash drives, like the cute little cruzer micro (1GB) that I also have."
1,Not great build quality,"Had it a couple weeks. Worked fine except that slider didn't lock well. Two weeks in it quit working, would not mount on any one of a half dozen computers. Was very happy to have backed up my data or it would have been gone. Returned for a refund."
1,Waste of Money,"I bought this item about 6 months ago and the U3 never worked. I went to the company for help and I give customer service a ZERO. They will never deal directly with you, it is necessary to create an account on their server and go through the account. Being a traveling person, they kept closing the account. Finley the last time no response from them. It does work as a 1.9GB thumb drive, big deal."
1,Unreliable product.,"I was very excited to get this drive as a gift so I could transfer large files, etc. After only 3 weeks of use I lost all 2GB of my data and they want me to return it. I have had mine RMA'd already, but I would be much much better off just getting another make/model of drive. The Cruzer Ti tends to fail within a month or so of moderate use. Sadly, they are replacing mine with the exact same model and I am sure I will have to RMA it again once it dies again. For now I will keep using it since I am stuck with it, but I will back up my data daily. While I have heard that the Cruzer Mini is much more reliable and just as fast, I no longer trust SanDisk."
5,Cruzer Titanium is a no brainer,"It is so Convenient and Sturdy: I wear my drive around my neck at work, and it certainly gets its knocks. The expense is nominal considering the quality of the product. I bought the 2G so I have music, photos, documents, schedules, to name a few, on this light weight, thin drive, and I know that my important documents are near and secure!"
3,I am a Closer fan and was expecting a bit more from this DVD,It's ok but not great. It seems to be a victim of its own format. The way the cast are interviewed and the setting are a bit lacking. I was hoping to have learned more about 'behind the scenes'. It's also unfortunate that several of the actors did not participate. Good to see once.
5,Ahead of the class,"I have been using this DVD through Netflix and as a person who is lethargic, I am still in the basic set of exercises. However, I have examined a number of workout videos and did not care for them, here's why:* In most DVDs, either the camera work, or the instructor leave you guessing as to what you are supposed to be doing. The instructor is excellent about explaining and cuing you to the next move.* The instructors don't necessarily explain what benefit you get out of the exercises, but this instructor does. Additionally, he will remind you of points to be concerned in the middle of an exercise so you can improve your workout and form.* Most DVDs are too slow or too fast. This one lets you hurt yourself at your own pace -- if you are not ready, you stick to basic. If you need more of a workout, you do the intermediate which is shown in parallel with the basic.One minor update: It is good enough that I ordered it, so as not to tie up my Netflix slot any longer!"
4,Worthwhile workout!,"I've watched and own more than my share of workout videos/DVDs. Most are good but not great. This one is very good, and just shy of excellent. It incorporates all aspects of the ABS Diet, and guides you thru a few strenuous routines. You can set up your own schedule and as long as you stick to it (and amend your routine as needed) you will find this a useful and worthwhile workout DVD. I bought it, and I'm glad I own it - but I'm even more happy to say that this is one I actually use!"
5,"User friendly DVD, highly recommended","This is a user-friendly DVD, highly recommended for those of us trying to shed some pounds/ tone up.1. It is comprehensive i.e. one can just follow the routimes in this through the week. I would however recommend a Stretch DVD for one day a week2. It can be done in the confines of the home, minimum extra equipment required, minimum space required3. It is relatively short, fits into daily schedule4. It is do-able by the ""average joe"". There is no complicated choreography. The routines are easy to learn. I would however recommend that one sees the DVD in full before attempting the first time. I would also say that it is tougher than it seems5. It can be done by both gents and ladies6. I would recommend that 6-times weekly option, but other options are also okay.Good luck - Abi"
3,Disappointed,"I saw an interview with this author and was very excited to get this book. Unfortunately, I was disappointed with both the content and the layout of the book. The idea behind the book is wonderful, but the layout is too scattered to navigate thru and the content is a little lacking. I really wanted to love and use this book."
1,Not worth getting,"If you are the person, like I was, interested in learning about the history and metaphysical properties of several different gemstones, I do NOT recommend this book! It's okay on the science of the minerals. But the book is not well organized, the minerals are NOT in alphabetical order or in any conceivable manner. It seems as if the author just wanted to hear themself talk. Again, DO NOT GET THIS BOOK!"
1,This book is terrible.,"I am so disappointed by this book. It was supposed to incorporate the Myers-Briggs typing into an in-depth analysis of the relationships between the types. It was very vague, not even bringing the types into discussion. It makes up 4 types that are extremely ill-defined. It repeats the scant indicies on these types over and over, using up pages so it looks like a thicker book. What a joke. Don't waste your time. It has very little, if anything, to do with Myers-Briggs and is so generalized it cannot truly help you."
3,who reads middle French?,"Rosalind Brown-Grant is one of the leading authorities on Christine de Pizan, and this is evident in this book. Unfortunately, the book is written for other authorities on Christine de Pizan. Most of the main points that Brown-Grant attempts to make are illustrated in the words of Christine...in the original French. If you speak modern French you'll probably be able to get by, but if not it's pretty inpossible to use this book as a viable source. Brown-Grant did a good job translating The Book of the City of Ladies, why couldn't she do the same for this book?"
2,SO SO,when i read the first page i thought ok well it will get better as i read on but as i read on it was like ok this book is all over the place half the time i couldn't recognize which character was talking and who was who. The only part of the book that kept me reading was i think her name was cynthia and the man she met at the gym had messed her over. So i finally finsished the book out of sheer boredom and i'm not even gonna talk about the ending.
1,Never Judge A Book By Its Cover,"I bought this book for two reasons: (1) the cover is very attractive and (2) EJD recommended it (based on the writing that's on the back of Sharon Mitchell's book). However, to be honest, I could not finish this book. Got to the end of Chapter 4 and quit. I guess nothing about the book, characters, or plot grabbed me. I guess I don't like when a book starts off with tons of characters because it gets very confusing keeping up with who is who. I think simplicity is best. Even though I laid the book aside to go on to other books, I still promised myself to read each and every book I've bought. Some books I have laid aside did start out slow, but I was able to finish them and they turned out to be good reads. Hopefully this book will do the same. And I'm very glad that she wrote another book. I know how hard it is to write a page-turner and I do hope Sharon Mitchell finds the right story for her 'voice'."
1,NOTHING GO'IN ON AT ALL.,"I got this book free and still could not get past the fourth page. I passed it on to a friend and she couldn't either. Some authors get better with time, maybe Ms. Mitchell will be one of them."
2,Don't buy this book borrow it from the library,Reading is one of my hobbies so I won't say that I wasted my money for this hard copy but I will say that I see room for improvement. I was a little disappointed because the book was kind of confusing to me. The end left me hanging........ I will be starting your 2nd book this week and I hope and pray that your writing style has improved. Be Blessed Sharon!
3,A soap opera in print,"Nothing but the rent, eh? Kinda makes you think the next line should be, ""You gotta have a J-O-B, if you wanna be with me...""I have no idea what made me pick this book up off the shelf, and actually pay for it. As I started reading it I thought of a soap opera in print. The characters were stereotypical in that it was another story of single women with ""man"" or ""insecurity"" issues.Why did I actually complete reading it? Well, why do most folks watch soap operas even though they dislike 'em? In my case, I needed something to read on the subway on my way into the office.But as I say about everything, what I might not have liked as much, someone else may love. Why else have the soap operas been so successful after this many years? If nothing else, read it, formulate your own opinion and give the feedback to the author."
3,Excellent,"This was a very well written book..hats off to Sharon Mitchell for putting together a book about sisters who are professional however, still lacked the skills to take charge of their personal lives and live life to the fullest."
3,"Good, but should have ended better","I loved every detail to the book but wished it would have ended better, perhaps giving the reader a little bit more info as to what would happen to each character. I have to give the author credit for a good cliff hanger, but perhaps this means a sequel is to come???"
4,Interesting But the Ending Could've Been More Exciting!,"I really enjoyed reading this novel once I really got into it. It took me several weeks to just want to pick it up and continue reading. I finally got into the stories of these women's lives and finished the book in a couple of days. I would like to know what happened in the lives of these women. Did Monique ever call Tyson? Did Cynthia get over her sickness and still continue to see Anthony? Did Roxanne finally move on or did she once again let Marcus back into her life? And did Gayle and Reggie hit it off? Sister, in the future, don't leave a sistuh hangin' like that."
2,This book was very interesting!,I don't know why yall hatin on this book i guess u just didnt understand it !to the ones that said not to waste your time i enjoyed it!
2,The rent is going on but not the plot,I did not like this book very much at all. The story line was WACK the way she develops the characters make sit hard to follow and these women seem to make very childish and immature decisions about their lives and the men in them. The most exciting part of the book was finding out that the bulimic character's boyfriend was married and she was a pitiful one. Then the character who let her work and her mother rule her life was foolish to say the least. There is no mention in the latter part of the book about the recently married friend whose wedding they attended in the beginning of the novel. Again the novel was hard to follow the end left you hanging and so did the entire plot. If you would like to read this book borrow it from the library. The quality of the plot in this book is extremely poor.
3,"By the mass paper back, if you have to read this book!","The story could have been good, but the author did not develop it well. Kinda left you hanging at the end. Some ole some ole. Kind of story. Nothing dramatic happened. Took me two almost three weeks to read. (Dull)"
2,I'VE READ BETTER-I'VE WROTE BETTER,"Because of the author's education I expected a better read, but I was sorely disappointed. While the dialogue was fluid, or should I say only Monique's dialogue was fluid, the rest of the writing was either stilted or repetitious. The use of the characters' names over and over again made me feel like I was in grade school. This novel also read very slow. The plot was interesting but it took Mitchell too long to get to the point that Cynthia had a problem. By the time she lets the reader know what was going on, only a few chapters are left and the ""problem"" was solved to easily."
2,"Okay, but everyone can't be at number one","This book was great for ""dead time"" i.e. stuck in the car, at the airport, waiting in a line. It left something to be desired. I believe the characters were well developed but the plot left something to be desired. I never like the open endings!"
3,enjoyable quick read,"reading this book, gave me great joy because all of the ladies were educated and had jobs. All had the money do what ever they wanted."
1,TOO SLOW...,I READ THIS BOOK ONLY BECAUSE I PURCHASED IT AND I DON'T LIKE TO WASTE MY MONEY BUT I WANT A REFUND. I FOUND MYSELF FALLING TO SLEEP ON THIS ONE. MAYBE NEXT TIME.
2,I Would Not Recommend It.,The book was OK. I would not recommend any body to go out and buy the book. This is the type of book to read when you do not have anything better to do.
4,Enjoyable !!!!,"This book was a good read. Thr characters in the book were warm, and funny as hell! What I enjoyed most about the book was the fact the the girls were all so different and then again so alike. Once you start reading it, it is hard for you to put it down."
3,It was decent but needed a little more effort into it,"I read the book four times but still didn't understand where the title came from. Although most of all the parts where good and characters where understandable, the ending was a little indecisive. The characters where more adamant than any book I have ever read. It viewed more of an adverse sides of the character than good. In the end, it was a very interesting book that I really enjoyed. It's heart-warming and altruistic."
4,High value for a good product,"I have two of these at home and a Dell 24"" at work. Compared to the Dell, I prefer the styling of the Gateway, though the controls for changing inputs or tweaking the brightness/contrast is more frustrating on the Gateway.One of the Gateway units I bought had to be returned due to a headache-inducing high pitched squealing noise, but my replacement has no such issue. The squeal usually started after the monitor was on for a few hours, so beware of this.Other reviews have pointed out the great specs; I will note that this monitor offers two sets of composite inputs for DVD players/game consoles (Dell only has 1). The monitor has 100 mm VESA mounts which work fine with my Ergotron stands. In particular, I want to note the high value of this monitor. The contrast is not as good as higher priced models--many LCDs have trouble with black, and this model does a good job on it (but it's not perfect). However, this is a great monitor given its relatively low price."
5,An absolutely beautiful monitor,"I'm a college student, and this monitor works great for all my needs. It's fun to play games on it and it's also really useful when I'm typing up essays, becuase I can see my entire essay at the same size where most people can't even see a full page. Plus the auto rotate is just cool.I highly recommend this product if you have the money."
4,"DVI Image great , rest.... not so good","I was excited when I saw this monitor in the store.I was still exited when I read the manual after I bought it.I got disappointed when I started using it.The VGA color was so bad , that I had to buy a Graphic Card with DVI.(With the new card the DVI is great. (the VGA with the new card is still terribly)I likeImage Quality with the DVIMechanically well build.I don't likeThe image Quality with VGA (color)The image Quality with component in (color and resolution.)The rotation funktion doesn't work that well.The menu gets confused with the PIP funktionand looks it up where I have to switch powerto the monitor off/on to reset.All the things I don't like where not available in comparable24"" LCD Products.The main reason of 1900x1200 res and okay contrast 1000:1For under $600 , I am reasonable happy with it."
2,Eh...i expected more,"I first got the monitor, and within 2 hours it died. The online tech support for gateway is awesome. they sent me another one within a few days. unfortunately, that one died after about 2 weeks. by then, CompUSA's return policy expired (only 14 days, how pathetic of them). Again, though, gateway sent me another one. now, after a few days, it's acting strange...i guess some people have good luck with this monitor while i continue to have horrible luck. and for the price, i wouldn't risk buying another gateway monitor ever again, especially if it comes from CompUSA...i have to admit. the color and resolution is awesome, and when it actually works, games and movies are sweet...never got the component to work very well though..."
3,Stay away from this if gaming,"The inverse ghosting on this model is horrible and gets you a bad gaming experience with trailing as big as a full centimeter long black trail, do yourself a favor and look at the Dell, LG, BenQ, etc.Desktop use is a pleasure, backlight bleeding is not that bad but it is there on a couple of corners, banding is not a problem for me."
5,Amazing Animals Zebra Toy,"What a fantastic toy for toddlers! It is perfect for little hands to hold, twist, and turn. It is so colorful and very durable. It will be around for years to come!!"
3,Hel en Hemel van Dachau,"I am looking for an English translation of this book please as my parents hid this man in their basement for a period during the war, in Arnhem."
3,Good for what it shows,"Physical quality of tape and sound is excellent. Disappointed in that more exhibitions not shown. Didn't feel ""Olympic atmosphere"" - no fan reaction shown especially something like Michelle's Fields of Gold performance terriffic but warmth of crowd ignored. If you recorded these live off TV probably have more of Olympic feel. Commercially, I guess it is the only one you're going to be able to buy. NBC paid big bucks for the monopoly so we're stuck with their production -- ain't ""free"" markets great!?"
4,Good product,This is a well made and durable product. It fits nicely in the other toys associated with this line of wood toys.
5,A must have for any TRUE fan of A7X,"All Excess is the ultimate look into the world of Avenged Sevenfold. Not only are we granted a feature-length documentary about the band's history, but a selection of music videos (""Unholy Confessions"", ""Bat Country"", ""Beast and the Harlot"", ""Seize the Day"") and live performances. I wish more bands would release DVDs like this. There is footage within the documentary dating back to some of their first shows, all the way to the present. There is plenty of humor and laugh out load moments, as well as some heartwarming moments (especially in the ""Seize the Day"" video which makes me cry almost every time I watch it). Avenged Sevenfold is undoubtedly a sensational band and all die-hard fans MUST own this DVD. It's a documentary! It's a collection of live performences! It's a collection of music videos!It's Avenged Sevenfold: All Excess!!!"
3,a gift,"came on time, and in good shape. it was for a teengaer who loves the band, and he is thrilled with it."
1,Avenged Sevenfold All Excess,"It was my fault. I didn't pay attention to it being a DVD. But when I got in touch with the company, they wouldn't exchange it. It would have cost me more to send return it then to keep it . The DvD itself is in good condition, I was just deeply surprised that they offered me no other option."
1,not a concert,"only pantera can sell a dvd without having any songs in it, A7X should make a live dvd with a whole concert not make us watch 'em wastin time, a cool dvd should be in BLS style. or machine head"
1,why,i wait and wait and wait for this dvd and it only features 6 tracks. 3 of them are played so much on the radio i cant listen to them any more. i figured it would just be one whole concert. were they afraid the other tracks they recorded didnt sound good cause ive seen them live and they are good. its like awaiting a new cd only to find out its not a full lenght not worth it.
4,5 guys who make great music.,"Yes, a bit more concert footage would have been nice but I did really enjoy getting a chance to learn more about what makes this great band tick. If you're already an A7X fan then it's definitely worth adding to your collection. BTW, the out take titled ""Hotel Drunks"" is hilarious ... is it just me or does Syn act just like Captain Jack Sparrow when he's drunk? ""Pink is the new black!"""
4,Good background but not enough!,"I like Avenged Sevenfold a lot, but dammit, I wish it was a much longer ""documentary"". I don't think one hour does A7X justice at all. In my opinion, I loved the music videos, and especially the band commentary, and even the video director commentary. I wish there was more live performances on there, a good idea would have been a full live show. But I would give this a 5 star review, but I just hoped A7X would have put out a much longer documentary. It was great stuff, it was, just not long enough. I recommend it to anyone who's a casual fan of theirs, but I really dig the music videos."
4,A Must for Breyer Collectors,"This is the ""bible"" for Breyer model horse collectors. The research is thoroughly documented, the amount of information about the molds and models is astonishing. The only reason I give it four stars is because many photographs are dark and hard to ""read."" I keep mine in the car for value references at antique shows and collectible fairs."
4,beyond brutal,"Left in Kowloon is the most brutal and heavy record I may ever own. These are the most lean, fat free metal songs around. Imagine the most brutal metal record you own... take away all the fluffy junk and leave only the heavy and brutal breakdowns and riffs....that is Premonitions of War. Each song outdoes the next in intensity and creativity. Rarely do you find any melody, except for ""The Octopus"", which is simply amazing.Not for the emo-core kids who want to hear about bleeding and broken hearts. Premonitions Of War tears out your heart, throws it against the wall and walks away."
3,Too short,"I think one of the other reviewers hit the nail on the head when he said that this album is too short and the songs end just when they're picking up steam. I don't own the album, I was considering buying it when I was in Hot Topic the other day and listened to it at one of their listening stations. I listened to the whole thing while leafing through a magazine and while I was kind of half-digging their sound, I couldn't help thinking that $16.99 was too much for this disc, considering how short it was. True, I've paid just as much, if not more, for other cds as short as this, like Slayer's ""Reign in Blood"" or anything from Deicide, but for some reason they stood out where this one lacks. I believe in trimming the fat, but they trimmed too much and there wasn't really much left that I haven't already heard. There were some moments of brilliance that stood out, but I just wish they lingered on them a little more."
4,An interesting read,"Not too full of psychobabble. Suitable for beginners or those with an interest in psychology, because we already ""know"" the characters. This book provides an intersting insight into how JKR has structured her world, and as such how we as people interact.A good read."
2,Great cover; bad book,"I bought this book, started reading it, then put it down for 6 months because it was so uninteresting.""An Examination of the Boy who Lived""? Not really. It's a collection of essay about psychology that mention aspects of the Harry Potter series. Maybe one or two essay actually discuss Harry's psyche, and even there the essays are open-ended, non-conclusive, and not wholly correct.Worst of all, it reads like a pile of essays handed in by psychology students.If you want to read it, get it from the library so that you can return it once you realize how terrible it is."
1,HUGE waste of money,Don't buy this!! I bought two of them. They can't crush ice at all. Even crushed ice can't be crushed in smoothies. Motors burned up within weeks. I swear I didn't put an ice cube in. No power at all. Spend a few more dollars and buy the bullet. I wasted money on two of these and could have had a bullet.
1,Flawed design wears out quickly,"I used this blender exclusively for smoothies using frozen fruit and various liquids, and it was cool while it worked. However, the connection between the base and the pitcher is rubber and wore out quickly, rendering it useless. Unless you use this product exclusively with relatively soft items, it will most likely not live long and prosper."
1,"Doesn't last long, rattles alot","We've been through three of these over about a year. The motor has gone out, the blender's seal falls out and gets chopped up. Hope you don't drink it."
2,hard to use it,"I have it about 2 months, use it every day but it is always hard to take the upper cup from the base.Last time I had to wait about 48h to turn around the upper cup and take it off, so I will be able to use it again. This happens about 2 or 3 times.However, when it is OK make wonderful smoothies."
1,ONLY LASTED 3 MONTHS,This blender is NOT made of quality parts and a gear in the motor unit striped out only after 3 months of use. Up until then it was great and we used it a lot making breakfast shakes. The hardest material we ever put in it was bananas. I contacted Sensio only to be told that they were out of the parts and to call back in 6 weeks. I guess that this is a reoccurring problem with this blender.I love that Amazon has this review section so that we can inform each other of low quality products or of a product that we liked.
1,Awful,"First of all, I chose this blender because another reviewer mentioned that the insides of the cups are smooth - not true. I kept it anyway, and after less than 10 gentle uses, the cup got stuck in the base while it was blending. I called Sensio Customer Service and was told that sometimes when you're blending ice, a vacuum is created. (Isn't ice blending one of it's major uses?) They suggested I heat it up with a hairdryer to break the vacuum. No luck. Then they suggested I break the cup (no suggestions on how) to break the seal. I drilled a hole in it and still no luck. Then they suggested I return it to Amazon (though I was past the typical return window). Amazon was more than kind in accepting it. Bottom line is this - the blender is nothing special when it works, it breaks easily, and Sensio Customer Service is a joke."
1,Not Recommended,"This little unit was GREAT for the first two months we owned it, making smoothies and margaritas in a jif. But today, just two months after purchase, the top apparently melted onto the base while making a banana smoothie. It's now toast and I'm now very disappointed. No breakfast AND no blender. Disaposable kitchen applicances just aren't my thing..."
2,Rocket Blender,"I bought an open box blender for cheap so I could replace my base which has abroken rubber impeller (the part that drives the blades in the cup base thatyou insert into the base). The original impeller rubber all shredded off frominserting and removing the blender cup many times - not a quality setup there.If the impeller was made of a better material or the contact was made bettereach time a cup was dropped in, it would be a good unit. My only other problemwas the largest cup was too small for me - I would have liked a full quartversion too. A nice change would be to make the impeller replaceable and giveyou a spare."
1,Not built to last,"This thing was great for the first 2 months. After that, a seal came out of the screw-on blade attachment and it started leaking every time we used it. then eventually the blade attachment housing completely cracked... and it is ruined. IF you use this once a day (on average), plan on it falling apart. I wish i had the receipt and box so i could take it back. This should never have made it on the market until it was built better."
1,disappointed :(,"I bought this blender a week ago. I was pretty excited, because of it's compact size, and it's sleek design. I found it quite convenient and easy to use. I used it to make yogurt and fruit smoothies... no ice, fresh fruit, not frozen. Oh well, while I was blending some over riped bananas to put in my smoothie, the thing died on me. I know in the instructions, it stated not to use the blender for longer than 3 minutes at a time, and to let the motor rest for about 3 minutes in between. I've been cautious of doing that, but I guess it was too much on the motor to puree brown bananas..."
1,HORRIBLE! DO NOT BUY!,"This was the biggest waste of money ever! I wish I was lucky enough to get a month or at least a week's worth of use, but I only got ONE use before it broke! I couldn't believe that the blender broke on my second time using it. As the numerous other reviews noted, something was wrong with the part on the base that turns the blades and it melted/stripped away. I wish I never bought this piece of junk. If it was possible I would have given this product 0 stars. Still waiting to hear back from Sensio if they will give me a replacement part."
1,Piece of garbage,"I bought this at Kohls for half price and I still feel ripped off. The plastic gear smelled like it was burning and wore down within a month. Soft bananas were too much for this ""blender"" to handle. I followed all directions exactly, but it is very cheaply made and will not last. Save yourself a headache and buy a real blender."
5,So far these are top choice,"I lent one of the sockets to a neighbor (bad move right?)He had tried to use it to take off a stuck lug nut on his old beater.the wrench he had used (not the ones from the set)was bent like candy cane, the socket, not a scratch.so i hand him a wrench from this set. After some serious pulling, the lug came off and the wrench and socket are just fine.Now don't go taking lugs off with these but i was suprized to see the strength of this tool set, also the metric and standard open end wrench sets Denali sells are amazing .Top Choice"
4,Not bad for the price,Good for general purpose use around the house. Can't beat the price for what you are getting in this set.
2,HORRIBLE CASE,"The sockets are fine. The etching is a little hard to see but it is manageable and the selection is great. The Case is HORRIBLE. The sockets are held in place by a carved-out hole for each and just gravity. If you tilt it or accidentally open it upside down (easier than you might think) they will all spill out. You can imagine how annoying it is to organize almost 100 little pieces.I CAN'T STAND THIS CASE. I am going to give these to someone and buy another brand. It is a shame really, a fine product ruined by Denali trying to save a few bucks on a case. SHAME.BUY ANOTHER BRAND."
5,Nice Socket Set!,I bought this set after my Craftsman set was stolen. It's hard to find a socket set with all 3 ratchets. This set is a good replacement for my Craftsman set. It is heavy duty. I was very impressed when I received it and would recommend to anybody.
4,Denali 93 piece set,"I recived pertty quick. They seem to be an exact copy of the 93 piece Husky set I bought in 04, which I have to say was the best tool set ever.(I NEVER BROKE A SOCKET OR RATCHET, jus lost (loaned) them, I am talking using on impact and cheeta pipes). If this set is half as good, it will be well worth the money. Does not claim to be droped forged. The ratchets seem to not have much slack in the gears. Case holds em well, also one of the few 1/4, 3/8, 1/2 drive sets out there, 6pt 12pt option is nice, and provides for redundancy. I've never had any luck with any thing from china. This is my first Denali purchase, and I have to say I would steer clear of most of what they sell, but this set is just too complete to pass up."
4,Good value,I ordered this set because I was taking a job that I needed to provide my own basic hand tools. These were the right price and I haven't been disappointed EXCEPT that I got 2 of the same socket. I'm missing a 6-point 7/32 shallow socket and received two 3/16 sockets. I've tried looking for a Denali website to no avail... At least the box has a 12-point 7/32 that I was able to use to do a car repair.
5,"Wow, what a deal !","This is a very high quality socket set at a very good price. It's a much better deal than what you'll find at Sears or Lowes. I was afraid that these were going to be cheap (like some of the sets you see at Harbor Freight), but that's not the case. They are really well made."
3,not bad for cost,"Over all the tools are solid and have been of good use working on my vehicle. the only time they become a hassle is in a tight spot when you do not have much room to ratchet back and forth, it will be hard to catch the next set of teeth. I found that holding onto the socket or the extender helped, but still made some jobs take longer. For everything else they have performed very well and i am happy with them, i even used them to hold some bolts while i used my breaker bar to take off all 4 struts."
1,Unwatchable,Tittle says it's for NTSC formats but it's actually PAL. You can't play this on a PS3 or Xbox 360.
4,album MP3 differs from CD,"I was searching for one particular Raffalli song. The CD description has it listed, but the album in MP3 format does NOT contain it. Thankfully, I double-checked the MP3 song list before buying! Beware."
2,the worst Cussler novel I have read,"Some of his novels are more plausible than others but this one is way way over the top. Just a fountain of youth story, OK. Just a wicked arms merchant story, OK. Just a way to destroy the oceans, OK. Any two of those,OK. Put all of those together with cannibal ghouls and it is a farce! Sahara was much more believable.Cussler always gives me a topic to research. In this case it is the Minoans."
4,Good escapist fare,"I've been a fan of Clive Cussler since I was a high school student in the early 80s. Lost City follows the Cussler formula of fantastic plots, easy female conquests, indestructable heroes, hair-breadth escapes, and fancy cars -- great stuff when you're looking for mindless entertainment. Suspend your disbelief for a fun ride as Kurt Austin, his beautiful female sidekick and his pals track down evildoers, discover the details of their nefarious plot to take over the world, and prevail against all odds to defeat the bad guys while dodging mutant zombies, robot submarines, flooding tunnels and other videogame obstacles."
2,Running out of ideas,"Old fan as I am, this one (and quite a few of the later ones) was a huge disappointment. Badly written, obvious plot, even more cartoonish characters than usual. Time for Cussler to retire methinks....."
2,Bye Kurt Austin,"I have enjoyed all of Cussler's Pitt and Oregon novels. They are exciting, surprising and well written. I began this series with the first book written and have read all that follow up to Lost City; I'll not be reading more, this was my last effort to like this series. The writing is tedious, the characters are always the same and the female is always the ultimate beauty and love interest of Austin. All I know of Austin and Zavala are that they are womanizers and miraculously get in and out of unbelievable situations all for the apparent motive of getting the girl and not ""saving the world"" as other more intriguing Cussler novels. It's undoubtedly perfect for some, not for me...give me more science and action! FYI...I am a female suspense/action reader in the order of Clancy et al and will continue to read Cussler's books; hoping to find other plots, action and characters as good as those in the Pitt and Oregon novels."
3,Could have been a 4,"This could have been a four star if the ending was a little better. It just sort of died off. It was very good and had a lot of action. The characters were described nicely and Cussler was at his best, but I could have used something else. The whole NUMA team is great and I liked the mystery about the helmet. It is worth it if you like Cussler and action books."
4,Same plot but STILL great read!,"Lost City follows the same, typical storyline as always -- good versus evil, boy meets girl, good guy saves world. I guess that's why I love Clive's books so much. Although Lost City is not as good as most of his books, I still enjoyed the read VERY much."
2,Doesn't even follow its own formula,"The story started off OK with the first two short chapters. Then it falls apart. The template is used but isn't filled out. The love interest isn't, the bad guys did it but we don't have a clue how the good guys know that. Getting into the clutches of the bad guys was done by following the script from the (imaginary) Scary Movie series for action fiction. Getting out of the clutches of the bad guys relied entirely on the stupidity of well-trained mercenaries (who could not have been trained to the level of Scoobie Do if they were really that stupid). There were a few interesting tidbits on history and historical paraphenalia, glaciers, old planes but the biology was 70's. A very disappointing read."
2,Not his Best by a Long Shot,"Hard to put your finger on it but this book just does not hold up to the 5 star Cussler books in years past.To start off we have almost 100 pages with our first threat that becomes a bit boring.Couple that with action/horror/bad guys/ and a central theme that has been played many times in the past. Different twist but the same old, same old.Suggest that if you MUST read this, do so at the library and save your bucks.It is only out of respect for Cussler that I give this 2 stars instead of 1."
1,Maybe its just me but I've read this before,"Has Cussler ever written more than one book? It seems each new one that comes out, including Lost City, is basically the same plot albeit with slightly different characters. I defy any fan of his to replace Kurt Austin with Dirk Pitt and have it read any differently.This one has to do with some shadowy arms dealing family trying to take over the world through the use of an ancient recipe for eternal life. Naturally, NUMA, through Austin prevents this from happening through a set of lucky circumstances.After reading this book, like reading all the others, I feel like I've just had a meal of rice cakes. I know that I've eaten something but for the life of me, I can't remember what it was.Given the loyalty of Cussler's readers, I know I'm shouting into the wind when I say this, but skip this one. You've read it before."
3,"Not the best, but not the worst...","I love Cussler's books, but this one just wasn't among his better works. At one point, (and I use vagueness so as to not spoil anything) the ""bad guys"" are linked to part of the ""evil plan"" by the ""good guys"", with no reason at all as to how the ""good guys"" found out that the ""bad guys"" were behind it. That was enough to make me page through the book and wonder if I had missed something. The reader is privy to an enlightening conversation, but none of the ""good guys"" are. Later on, the ""bad guys"" admit to it, but it's never exaplined how the ""good guys"" found it out for themselves.Over all, it was enjoyable, but that one plothole was enough to take off one star."
2,Kost City gets lost,"Having read almost every Cussler since ""Raise the Titantic"", perhaps I've come to expect too much. The difference is that now Kurt Austin is nothing more than Dirk Pitt redone, and the storylines are well worn, the action has been done to death and the bad guys are cartoons. The writing moves along, but is uninspiring. Maybe a book a year is too short a deadline, and more time between books would help the authors to develop better plots and stronger action and characters who are not the same old stereotypes, or maybe Clive should go it alone again. This is the second in a row that has disappointed this much, and I'm not looking forward to anymore as I once did."
4,Good Read,"Pretty simple - as with all Cussler novels, if you like Cussler, you'll like this one! Someday I'll read 'em all."
4,Excellent Camera But This Combo is Overpriced,"I gave this 4 stars because I dont think the Coach case is worth the extra $100. You can get this camera for $399 and to pay $499 for this combo with the Coach case seems unreasonable to me. I got this as a gift and trust me, I would have preferred the hundred bucks cash :-)"
2,Dissapointing,This tape is touted as being able to repair plumbing among other things. I used it to seal some fittings on a shallow-well pump and it tore loose within a week.It would probably be good to wrap tool handles when they become splintery but I will not depend on this product to bail me out of a jam.
1,NG,"I had a chance to use this, this past weekend on a underground water pipe with a leak. I shut off the water clean the dirt off and did a double wrap. Waited about 5 min and turned on the water and it leaked under the edges."
2,Not that wonderful...,"There is a great new Suede track. It's called ""SIMON"". It's not on this album. Rather, they've put it as the b-side to the downright drab first-single, ""Positivity"". And it's kind of a theme, IMO.Suede were a great band. A GREAT band! And what was such a bonus for the fans is that their b-sides were often as good as the album material that they released.Now we have ""A NEW MORNING"", which isn't even as good as their old b-sides. And the one - ONE - really great new song they've come-up with, they hide it on a b-side. Sad.If you're a hardcore fan, you'll likely be disappointed, but still find something to like on here. ""OBSESSIONS"" is a pretty good song... there are a couple on here, but ""COMING UP"" or ""DOG MAN STAR"" this isn't."
1,What happened to Suede?,"I think everyone who has actually ever listened and loved any previous Suede album cannot possibly appreciate this garbage. From the truly original and uncompromising band that Suede once was, they have become a below average pop/rock band. The last album wasn't so hot, but this one is complete garbage. Brett has forgotten how to sing and the songs all have the same sound, which isn't the Suede sound may listeneres have come to love. Brett's voice isn't stronger on this album, he sounds like he's struggling through every bar on every track. Aside from the palatable ""Positivity"", which sounds like a re-write of previous material, I couldn't even listen to the other songs to the end. After a lot of anticipation, this album was a huge dissapointment. It's the first Suede album I ever returned, and I hope it's the last."
2,lacklustre,"One word for this album... crummy. A pretty lousy record, really. ... Brett Anderson sounds like he smoked and entire carton of cigarettes before every take. I mean, the last album certainly had some limitations but this one is a straight to video effort. ... A couple listenable tracks are worth mention. 'Astrogirl' 'One hit to the body' and 'Lost in TV' recall a once great Suede but fall short of saving the album from abysmal failure. Tracks not worth mentioning include 'When the rain falls' 'Beautiful Loser' 'Lonely Girls' and 'Positivity', especially the latter. I thought 'Elephant Man' was bad. ..."
3,Skip the first 6 tracks,"(London) Suede's new album (without an expected release in the U.S. and Brazil), is the worst one of them all. Some tracks such as ""Positivity"" and ""Lonely girls"" are just a pale reminiscence of tracks from the other albums. But there are some perfect moments, like ""Astrogirl"", with a piano and orchestra arrangement by guitarist Richard Oakes, ""Untitled"", the best track of the album (very climatic, with lyrics saying things like ""I'm just a stupid guy, crushed like a butterfly""), the possibly-hit ""One hit to the body"" and the lovely couple of songs which end the album, ""When the rain falls"" and ""Oceans"". Did I miss Bernard Butler? No, absolutely. But I miss Ed Buller, the old-time Suede's producer."
1,FAR WORSE THAN ANYTHING I COULD'VE IMAGINED!,"What has happened? I started asking myself that after the last record. Being somewhat tolerant, I gave the boys another chance to enhance my cd collection, they took that chance and embarassed themselves with a record of drab, boring and childish babble. This disc is so bad it deserves no stars. Some advice to Brett and co. would be to stop putting out thoughtless dribble and revisit Dog Man Star, or even Coming Up. The comparision thing is the worst part of this being a horrid record. Suede were at one time a GREAT BAND, full of amazing charisma and skillfull songwriting. They are now a bunch of babies not capable of writing an inspired tune if they had to to. It has now become time to fly over to the UK myself, and hand-over my Suede discs to Brett and say ciao, You have officially lost it."
4,"Old Habits, New Directions","Suede's fifth release, A New Morning, is a mixed bag of familiar themes and new maturity. On the plus side, there's simplicity, grit and depth in Brett Anderson's vocals. These are the first songs he's recorded since a stint in rehab, and his renewed commitment to singing is palpable. The faux-Bowie phrasing and glam androgyny is gone, revealing a finer vocalist than previously apparent. In addition, there are some skillfully empathetic tracks, notably ""Lonely Girls"", ""One Hit to the Body"", and the extra track ""You Belong to Me"". Still, there are remnants of their by-now knee-jerk analysis of pop decadence in tracks like ""Streetlife"" and ""Astrogirl"" (if you're familiar with the band, those titles tell you all you need to know). Regardless, A New Morning is good news for fans - it's both a retrenchment and an honest step in other directions."
3,c'mon!,"Okay. This is probably the worst Suede release yet. But this is really a soft rock album. If you like Suede for their harder leanings, you might not like this album. But being soft rock in terms of production, it is quite good. Obsessions and Positivity are great songs. The rest is good stuff, and terrific compared to usual mainstream stuff. The next album will be very strong. Judging by the weak response to A New Morning, Suede will re-coup next time. Mark my words and look out!"
3,Doesn't rock,"Suede is one of my favorite bands, and I have bought every new release without bothering to sample. Unfortunately, I can't be very complimentary about the new CD. This one is loaded with the lengthy ballads for which the band is noted, but these new songs sound too much like the last two CDs, and this CD's not as good as the last two. The lyrics and music are too similiar from song to song (the word ""magazine"" seems to appear in every song). What I really miss are the rockers the band used to do. Suede may be a band whose time has passed. There are no new ideas on the new CD and I doubt I will play it very much."
2,a shock,"what the hell has Brett done to his voice? . Brett has obviously made a concious effort to make his voice less ""operatic"", and in doing so has killed off one of the things that MADE Suede such a great band in the first place. Oh and they used to have ace tunes as well, not the bubblegum radio friendly pop scattered throughout this poor album. Get back with Ed Buller fellas!, oh and visit your dealer while your at it!"
1,It's fortunate that this is out of print...,"It's been said that the relationship between the Duke and Duchess of Windsor was the ""Romance of the Century,"" and that their love was ""deep and true."" If their romance was based on the prattle in their letters, then it was definitely sophomoric and banal. These letters read like two teenagers speaking baby-talk to each other. I realize that these people were insipid and shallow, but it puts their relationship in a whole other light. Stupid and self-serving as well."
3,The Status Que.,"Occasionally ardent lovers do communicate in teenage verbiage and it's not unusual for love letters, however ""deep and true"", to come across as sophomoric or banel to the non participant. What did you expect from the Duke and his anorexic society Duchess, the Gettysburg Address?By the way, most people are insipid, prattling and self-serving, however packaged. This is news?"
1,Border Biscuit packaging problems,"Let me start by saying that I love these little ""biscuits"", so even crumbs can be enjoyed - but I do prefer them whole. They arrived quickly: however; there was not one whole cookie in any of the boxes. They were a mass of broken bits. I think the vendor needs to improve their packing methods so that the integrity of the product is maintained."
5,Review of A Sea Island Lady,"This is an excellent historical novel of the pre and post Civil War era. The book spans approximately 70 years. It is not a strictly southern depiction of the war as the main character, Emily, comes south from Boston during the war. All of the characters are well-developed. The plot is coherent. The descriptions of South Carolina, and Beaufort in particular, are truly excellent. Having travelled to Beaufort and Charlston, I can testify that Mr. Griswold researched his setting well. The book combines elements of comedy, history and tragedy. It is far superior to Gone With The Wind and reaffirms the value and gratitude of life itself."
5,the best,I use this eye product every day. It was recommended to my by the lady who does my facial laser work but she said to only put it on around the bone structure not right underneath the eye. I find it good & helpful but its always hard to know if its the best thing to use because there are a million products out there & of course they all say they're the best & that they work so I go with what's recommended to me & if I don't suffer adverse effects then I go with that.
4,slasher score to suburban decay,"this is a more atmospheric wolf eyes release and not representative of the wall-of-noise update of the throbbing gristle aesthetic which has come to define their sound. despite this, dead hills (the title track, which is easily the highlight)manages to startle just as their more visceral work and has become adapted by millions of teens as an anthem which reflects the decay surrounding them and the anguish overcoming them. it is the ""smells like teen spirit"" of our generation."
2,not as useful as i anticipated,i guess i should have realized this before i purchased but with dslrs you have to close the hood to get your eye close enough to compose the shot and then have to reopen it to check the lcd. after a while it was easier just to shade the lcd with my hand. probably those who use point and shoots and compose through the lcd anyway will find this more useful
5,A terrific disc from a very entertaining group of guys,"I first encountered Ace and the Ragers through their live shows in Alfred, NY where myself and one of the band members attended college. The live show in itself is a blast; the guys have great stage presence as well as a live set that absolutely demands dancing until you drop. The disc manages to capture much of the terrific entertainment and high energy that is presented live, and is a good change of pace from what one usually hears on the radio.I highly recommend Ace and the Ragers to those who want to listen to some unique music that lets one cut loose. And if you have a chance to see these guys live, definitely jump on it!"
2,"Their worst effort, but not terrible.","This is by far the Levellers worst release. I have all their other CD's and like every song with many being considered great, others being real good, while just a few are considered to be merely good. This latest CD though has 4 songs that are flat-out bad. The remainder of the songs, compared to the other discs, do fall into a range between my merely good and real good categories. So, if you're looking to purchase the Levellers for the first time, I highly recommend you follow through. But, choose one of the earlier releases. Although 'A Weapon Called A Word' and 'Levelling The Land' are the first ones I ever heard and fabulous, I'm kinda partial to 'Zeitgeist'. If you're a diehard fan and don't yet have this CD, do consider buying it. You can always improve the listening experience by recording just the good songs while discarding the very bad ones."
1,If I could choose the life I lead then I would be a pop star,"What is this? What is this horrible retro Beatles garbage that starts off this disc? There is nothing worth listening to on here which is sad since I've played all their other albums to death. What happened to the celtic anarchy? There's no sign of politics anywhere on here.This seems like a bid for mainstream acceptance, and every great band deserves to have at least one stumble forgiven, so ignore this, and seek out Levelling The Land, Zeitgeist,and Levellers Just treat this one as a cautionary example of what happens when you lose sight of what gave you your heart in the first place."
3,I think those guys were overrated,"Very disappointed after buying this because of all the good reviews. I dont have a problem with ""raw and primitive or noisy"". However what i see here is the sad very last reserve of old men making blues based noise on terribly out of tune guitars. OK this was not nice and a bit exaggerated. But not more than claiming that a guy who due to several illnesses and handicaps can hardly raise his hands not to speak of moving his fingers is the last survivor who can play like the old blues heroes of the 1930s. And while that Fat Possum stuff might have been finally successful and found its audience - i dont see any connection to the sound of the great 1930s blues recordings as they claim at some point. Still worth a look as for what it is. Sorry for my bad english.Imagine I (the typical mid aged balding white guy) would join a local blues jam and play like that..."
1,Duplicate Titles,"I have a real problem with the author changing the title of a book and then trying to pass it off as a new book!!! Show me any difference between the book called Vineyard Fear and the original book called Cliff Hanger. This is the third time he has done this. I really enjoy Philip Craig,s books but find this practice disgraceful."
3,Title Change,"I absolutely agree with Mr. Wells! Changing the title of the book is sneaky - if I hadn't read the reviews, I would never have known that this books is actually ""Cliff Hanger"" which I just finished reading. While the book is quite good, I am very annoyed that the published appears to be trying to pull a fast one!"
5,Zee Leaves & J.W. Mourns,"VINEYARD FEAR by the late Philip R. Craig is one of those books that makes a cozy so much fun to read. The plot is intricate, solutions may be messy, but they serve the purpose.Zee needs time alone to make the big decision and J.W. is afraid she may choose medical school over his frequent requests to marry him. J.W. is helping his friend John Skye move his vehicles to the Island when first a hit & run driver bounces him off a fender, second the gas logs in John's mainland house are turned on when J.W. is under-the-weather, and third he is checking on John's house when a bullet misses him. By then J.W. is sure someone is trying to kill him, but why or does the killer have the wrong man?This title in the series takes the reader from Martha's Vineyard to the mountains of Colorado for some fast paced action and personal insight. An excellent read for a sunny day in the shade.Nash Black, author of Indie finalists WRITING AS A SMALL BUSINESS and HAINTS."
5,Cliff Hanger,This book is also known as Cliff Hanger. it says what it was published as at the bottom of the book. Great book got me hooked on the series!!!
5,Great series!,"I found this series by accident, friend loaned me a copy of one in the series. Now I am buying all the books in the series and trying to read them all in order. Excellent characterizations, interesting locales, well though out plots, everything you need for a successful series."
5,An Innocent Bride by Betty Neels (Large Print Harlequin),"Another sweet satifsying romance from Betty Neels!Description from the book back cover:Aunt Thirza had been a lifeline to Katrina Gibbs, but her death left Katrina with little money and no marketable skills. She had inherited her aunt's small cottage in Dorset. She also had Simon Glenville, the wonderful doctor who had cared for Aunt Thirza. Simon loved Katrina, and he thought Katrina loved him, but so much had happened to her he wasn't at all sure this innocent girl was aware of it. When the time was right, he would propose, they'd plan a white wedding, and he would cherish her all their days ...WHITE WEDDINGS - When true love waits - until the wedding night ..."
5,SUPREME!!!,"I would have to agree with the customers. Ever since I've played Dance Dance Revolution 1st Mix, the first song I ever chose was Boom Boom Dollar itself. I like the sounds of the music, the beats, its power amazes me! Even though I haven't gotten this CD yet, I definitely know I will, especially since I'm hooked on this song. When I heard it the first time, I knew I would immediately love it. I read a preview that Koanmi has said Boom Boom Dollar is the best song ever, and there are millions of fans out there who appreciate awesome music such as this. As a matter of fact, BBD is the greatest classic to ever hit the arcade. In short, King Kong & D.Jungle Girls is the best artist ever. No argument!"
2,Heavy spoon,It's little short and quite heavy. I didn't like it as a spoon and not quite sure what is it good for as a tool.
5,Three great remasters in a row! Where is #4?,"Three hot remasters in a row! Great sound quality. You should snap this one up for that alone. The additional cuts are a bonus. Add this one to your collection and you can't go wrong, great crusing and party music."
4,Fun Read,I am not very knowledgeable about the best authors in lesbian romance but was familiar with the name so I bought it. I love how the main character evolves into some one who wants that commitment and chemistry. I love reading about the women she has in each port and the different dynamics they use and was fun as always to read the romance. (Spoiler alert) So glad she came home to some one who can give her variety and the excitement she needs to be romantically fulfilled.
1,Useless,This is perhaps some left-over from 10 uears ago. It does not work with Vista or higher OSs. I just waisted some good money.
1,Does not work with Windows 7,"I guess I should have read the reviews a little closer, I would think a company such as SanDisk would support thier products a little better."
3,Good item but not convenient.,"Good item but not convenient. After restart my comp, big banner shows up top of the login window. It is looking for usb flash drive. The banner message should pop up when I want to use usb drive."
1,Sandisk products NOT VISTA COMPATIBLE,Do not buy any Sandisk Products if your computer is running Vista.... You would think they have had enough time to get their drivers up to date..... So if you have Windows VISTA don't buy any of their products!!!!!!!!!!
3,Why did they leave out the complete short programs?,"I enjoy the good video quality and the commentary, but honestly, couldn't they have included the full short programs for the singles events? Obviously they have the footage. The competition tape is only 80 minutes long; obviously the VHS can hold more.Why?"
3,Disapointed!!,"I just bought this video, and I was greatly disapointed! I saw the original footage on TV and they edited this thing so much it is rediculous! My greatest disapointment came in the Exhibition Tape. True it shows all of the performences wow, but not as they were shown on the original broadcast! I remember that when Michelle Kwan took the ice, before she the music started, before she stood still, people gave her a standing ovation!! I also remember how Scott Hamilton and Roslynn Somners could barely contain their tears when they saw Michelle skate and cry at the same time! I bought this tape wanting to relive that moment, and it was not there! Not to mention that you don't get the short programs which were outstanding specially Yagudin's! Perfect 6.0 if you ask me! But I guess this will do!"
4,AFV on DVD,"I bought this DVD for my son and it was not what I expected. There was more talking with the guests & host than there was funny videos. Needless to say, it didn't keep my son's attention for long."
3,The panel discussion kills the rythm.,AFV is one of our favorite toys each Sunday evening. So we decided to get this CD for long car rides. The clips are funny as always but what we all agreed on is that the panel discussion kills the rythm of the show. It does take them a while to begin to play off each other and Tom does a good job to keep them moving - but that's the point: it should look like so much work! And it shouldn't again be about winning another set of money - it should be more about the clips. Had I previewed this CD I don't think I would have bought it.
1,Battle of the Bess,We love the show and have many of the DVDs but this one is NOT a good one. It has way too much talking and not enough videos. This show has 4 hosts and is all about their comments of the videos. Who cares!! Our family just likes to watch the videos.
1,There nothing lower than one star?,"Wow, just caught the last 20 minutes of this with my in-laws, and my god...it's terrible. Just when you start to really notice how bad the script is, you realize how awful every aspect of the film is. It's lit like a supermarket dairy aisle. The actors took notes from telemundo. The lead female character is apparently a doctor/preacher/bad mom? I don't know. I got kind of bored and started making up my own story.Cheryl Ladd though...she's still got it."
3,Holiday Baggage,I was somewhat disappointed with this one as it was not a warm fuzzy movie. It is about real life issues and how they are handled around the Holidays. Some of the actresses werenot believeable.
1,Terrible,Thought this would be a great chistmas movie but it definitely was about family baggage. This is not a movie that would give you christmas cheer.
3,Not a warm one,I always like to watch a few Christmas Themed movies this time of the year to get in the mood. This was not a good choice. It is inderacted with characters that are underdeveloped and not easy to warm up to. Definitely will not be on my list for next year.
2,Could have been great,"Great story line but Barry Bostwick just didn't fit nor did he do a good job of acting. He looked like an 80 year old drunk, and pretty much acted as much. The supporting cast did pretty good... I usually cheer for the ""over-the-hill"" actors when they get a chance to shine one more time, but this just wasn't a good role for Barry. This movie will be donated to the library."
2,Not my cup of tea,"I bought this because I love both of the main actors, but it was much more depressing of a movie than I like to watch during the holiday times."
1,Skip this One,"I gave this turkey one star only for some of the cast. But they were fighting an uphill battle because of a weak script. The father is an unfaithful and unlovable jerk. The mother is a fool for considering taking him back and, although she is supposed to be a hard-working doctor, she is only shown in that role in one scene at the start of the film. The older daughter is whiny and annoying, and I couldn't even get a handle on the younger one. The son-in-law drifts through the film like a zombie. There is only one redeeming and sympathetic character, and he dies...The basic problem is in the script. It appears to have been written by a guy who wanted to justify his bad behavior. And it fails on all counts.There are lots of great holiday films available. pass on this one."
3,Holiday Baggage,The wife and I didn't much care for the movie. It very slow moving. I think the Ladd should have kicked the husband to the curb in the end.
4,VERY PLEASED!!!!,"THANKS, SO MUCH FOR THE GOOD SERVICE WE RECEIVED. I REALLY DID ENJOY THIS CHRISTMAS MOVIE, I LOVE CHRISTMAS MOVIE. BUT, THANKS AGAIN FOR THE GOOD SERVICE. PLEASE KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK!!!!"
4,"Great for a kitchen, not industrial uses","These are extremely well built and easy to use. An OK amount of light for the price. We were looking for more light for use in an industrial application, and had to go with something many times more expensive than this to get it. For kitchen undercabinet applications, this woudl be a great product, which is probably the true intention for it."
1,Stopped working after about five minutes,"I bought this light strip to place on my computer desk under a ledge just over my keyboard so that I could see function keys, etc, at night. My computer had been in a dark hole because my back blocks light in the room. It would have done the trick but five minutes after I had it on, it burned out. It would not come back on. This may just be a fluke but my experience was that I had to throw it away. I am, therefore, giving it one star. The system would not let me give it no stars. I did not waste more of my time on sending it back as return postage and the time to box it up and go to the post office just weren't worth is. A waste of money for me."
1,"LEDs burned out early, other half dim","These LEDs aren't lasting anywhere remotely close to how long LEDs are supposed to last. Half have burned out, and the other half have gone extremely dim,"
1,Do not buy if you need light!,"These lights are a joke, really. They do not shed enough light unless you install them end to end with not much space in between! On top of that when I tried to return them, I was told I had to get permission from the seller. I did that, and because the process is so confusing, I did not find their reply until yesterday. (It says emails were sent, but the reply did not come to me- I had to access the order to get the RMA.) That's Amazon's fault, not the sellers'. Or maybe, I admit, it's just because I'm confused! Either way,I would buy from this seller again if I needed something. Just not these lights."
5,Best Vinyl Toys Book ~,"Vinyl Toys Maniac, this is the best complete book for you. Cool stuff & you'll want to read this book over and over again without gettin bore ~ 2 Thumbs up ^^"
4,Great book,"I got this book for my husband, and he loves it. He is very much into these type of toys. Thank you Amazon!"
3,I am plastic and spare,"I was hoping this book would give me a little insight into the world of the designer toy. Instead, I got a pictorial, not a book...not a word of explanation, just pictures of the various toys. Too bad - it would have been more enlightening if the author included even bullet descriptions of the provenance of such toys: why are they called designer toys, when did this phenomenon start, where is it a craze, will it continue to be a craze and what makes one toy a hit and one not. This short review has more words than you'll ever read in the book."
5,Superb photographic manual,A simply excellent coffee-top style manual with great colour photography for all fans and serious collectors of Japanese toys. My 11-yr old keeps it next to his bed.
4,Good for Nintendo Collectors,"Bought this for my son for X-mas. He loves Nintendo and all that is Mario and Luigi. Of course this stuff is expensive and sometimes not well made. Reminds me of the quality of something one might win at a carnival. However, he doesn't mind because he loves his Luigi so if that describes you or your child worth it. If you are looking for something that might get played with or some quality, don't look here!"
4,Good woorkout,This yoga workout is both relaxing and challenging. My only criticism is that they do not name the poses. The flow of poses is smooth and she does a good job at describing how your form should look.
2,not great,the music alone is a reason to turn off this dvd before it even begins. if you are looking for power yoga- stick to rodney yee. this would probably be ok for a beginner- if you could mute it.
2,meh ...,"I did not like this workout. It was very simple and I think the hardest move in it was a deep lunge. After 40 minutes I did not even break a sweat or have a single sip of my water.It also moved very fast so you never really felt your muscles stretch or burn from holding the position. Also, it was filled with somewhat cheesy workout expressions like: ""c'mon, you can do it!"" and ""look how hard you've worked!!"" Which I find annoying.Lastly -- it was based around yoga moves, such as downward dogs and lunges, but it did not have any of the yoga mentality. If you are looking for peace and calmness of mind (which yoga often brings) along with a good workout, I'd suggest looking elsewhere. If you are looking for a quick, low impact workout and you aren't flexible or muscular (and maybe have bad joints) then you might like this DVD."
3,"light workout, not for relaxing","Compared to other yoga dvds, this is more of a workout. I didn't get as good of a stretch as I do from most yoga classes or dvds. The instructor didn't use the names of the poses, which i guess isn't that important since you can see her, and the person who was doing the modified positions wasn't in view most of the time. This would be good for someone who is just starting to work out, or for a light work out for someone of moderate fitness level. I would pass if you are not new to yoga and if you're in good shape. I felt like it was kinda a waste of my time, I didn't get a stretch or a work out."
3,"It's a beginner routine, excellent if you are new with Yoga!!","For me, this is a good routine because I am new at Yoga and I was looking for something relaxing but with certain level of demand. Like all The Firm routines, this is a good one!!."
1,Not the original Firm anything. Gaian bought the company and none of the tapes since this horrible corporation bought are,Half as good as the original Firm tapes. Gaian is a huge horrible corporation and I do not recommend anything by them
2,Might Do Again in a Pinch,"This DVD was just OK. I have been attending yoga classes for the last 6 months and wanted something short to do at home and thought this might fit the bill. The biggest flaw is that they don't name the positions. If you are in ""cobra"" say you are in ""cobra"" so a beginner can associate the position with the name. A beginner going from this DVD to a class might have a hard time because they wouldn't know the names of the positions. Also they spent an awful lot of time in the ""downward dog"" position for my taste and the flow from one position to the next was awkward at times. You were constantly watching the TV rather than relaxing into the poses. Music wasn't very relaxing either. I think I am going have to pass on this one."
5,The best of mid-century sounds; a must-have.,"If you like The Kinks, The Who, The Byrds, The Yardbirds, The Beatles, and The Rolling Stones, this cd is a must-have. It's also chock full of Mersey-Beats-Au-Go-Go; there's a bit of R&B, too. From a marvelous sample-laden rendition of Link Wray's surf-goes-psychedelic ""Jack the Ripper,"" to Jonathan Richman's ""Dancing Late at Night,"" to the ultra-catchy originals ""Let Me Fly"" (which would be great for a snowboarding or airline commercial) and the sweet and dreamy ""Crimson Star,"" there's many an enjoyable tune here."
4,Not the best but still good,"A good collection of songs, as are all the Grammy Nominees cds. The only problem really with these types of albums, is that the songs get so much airplay that you can get tired of hearing them after a while. That was the way with me and this disc. But now, 3 years later, I can listen to it again as most of the songs aren't played that much any more. This collection though, doesn't cover as many genres as other Grammy cds have. Everything on here is rock with a couple r&b."
4,A Great Introduction to the Magic of the Brill Building,"Initially disappointed that this collection leaves out such classics as ""Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow,"" ""We've Got to Get Out of This Place,"" ""You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin,"" and the Ronettes' version of ""Be My Baby,"" etc., I'm satisfied this collection gives a great sampling of the range of songs and talents involved in that era--with 50 tracks on two discs, there are plenty of nuggets. It's an excellent introduction to The Raindrops (Jeff Barry and Elaine Greenwich)--who have an almost garage band/protopunk energy. Given the lack of choices, it's an excellent start on the Brill artists, although it may move you to try to collect other songs and artists from those years. Again, it's oddly selective (no Lieber-Stoller material), but still strong. If you saw A&E's ""Biography"" on the Brill writers and get these two discs, you'll have a good sense of an amazing time in pop music."
4,Review of seller.,"The CD was shipped in a timely manner and plays fine. However, it was advertised as ""like new"". There was some gunk on the case, so I think a more accurate description of the condition would have been ""very good""."
4,Works for me,"I've heard bad things about this product, but I think that depends on what type of burner you have. I have been using Velocity products for many years and have found them very good."
1,I won't but it again,"I bought a box of Velocity DVD-R 8X (different quantity) before and gave it to my friend. He threw all the DVD's into garbage can after he tried first one. He made a lot of DVD copies before, but never got this kind of bad blank DVD.I also bought a box of CD/DVD cases of this brand. The top one is cracked when I received it.I'm not sure if it's my bad luck or the products have bad quality, but I won't buy any products of this brand again."
4,Great supplement to your Internal Training,"Like all martial arts book, this is a good supplement to your current training. This book focuses mostly on the very basics of qigong and internal martial arts-- standing. It has a very in-depth look at various standing exercises and a decent curriculum for the exercises. I wished there were more pictures to describe some of the exercises though. But the descriptions were extremely clear and I would recommend this to anyone who is practicing qigong or martial arts in general."
5,It changes your life!!!,"I recommend this book to everyone seriously interested in dramatically improving their health. This books may change your life. Sifu Wong Kiew Kit is definitely the best of all. If you want to experiment yourself in a new dimension, the best you can do is getting this book and follow the ""easy to do"" instructions on a daily basis....you will for sure see the benefits in a short period of time."
2,Chi kung????,"After reading this book i asked myself if it's chi kung book or a zhan zhuang(Yiquan) book. I don't know chi kung but i know, a little, ZZ practice and about me the author'd like to speak about yiquan. But at last he fails. Good picture and a good writing explain us a lot 'yiquan' or 'xingy' postures but Mr Kam Chuen Lam forgets the mental training. Saying ""be relax"" or ""thinking to wonderfull garden for relaxing"" is not useful to yiquan mental training. The author concludes the book with the illustration of 5 elementes arranged 5 type of punch: the explantation's not always clear. Perhaps Kam Lam Chuen videotape could be clearer. Eh?"
1,SUCKS !,"Very cheaply made, won't last, flew off first time out, adjuster broke ! Way too much money for the quaility !"
4,Not Bad,This wiper is not to bad. Like the other review said it is a bit over priced. However it does the job. It only took about 10 minutes to install on my John Deere gator. It beats the $1000.00 John Deere wanted for a glass windshield and a wiper. Most of the after market wipers say not to use on plastic windshields. This one did not specify. I do not see what the difference is. For the amount of time I will use it I can not imagine it scratching it that much. I can not imagine how to install this on glass.
4,No cute sexy music anymore,"Just take a look who's playing here : Booker Little, Eric Dolphy, Mal Waldron, Coleman Hawkins and Mr. Max Roach and more: and Monk liked the way she sang ""blue monk"". A great album."
3,missing track,"Where's Strawberry Tango from the closing credits?It's from the movie ""All the Pretty Horses"". Also,is Chica Dificil sung in Portuguese on the CD? It is in the movie. These and other questions have kept me from buying the CD."
3,Chica Dificil no fue cantada en Portuges,"Finally saw this excellent film! Fantastic music...why isn't it all on the CD??Aterciopelados' ""Chica Dificil"" was sung in Spanish in the movie; Manu Chao's ""Mingha Galera"" was sung in Portuguese. Still worth owning."
4,The Baby's 2nd album that broke them in the USA,"The 1977 Baby's album ""Broken Heart"" was the album that really allowed American audiences to learn whom they were. The album has some stellar tracks like ""Broken Heart"", ""Give Me Your Love"", and ""Isn't It Time"" (which charted as did ""Solver Dreams""). ""Right or Wrong"" is another fine track. John Waite has been a long time favorite of mine and his solo career continues even today. While The Baby's did not become a huge hit, they sold out mid-sized arenas and I had the opportunity to see them live which is where this band truly excelled. If you did not have the chance to see them, you can still hear them so get this album now.If we are lucky, some live footage may be released someday for all to enjoy. This music still stands the test of time even today."
1,FALSE LINK FOR HELEN REDDY,"This is NOT I repeat NOT the Helen Reddy CD Amazon wants you to believe it is. I clicked on the first, the original Helen Reddy Album, entitled HELEN REDDY, from 1971 and got here. Amazon says this is the same, it is NOT. The album should have Helen Reddy in a tie-dye sundress, wet to the knees and have the following songs: TIME---HOW---COME ON JOHN---SUMMER OF '71---I DON'T REMEMBER MY CHILDHOOD---NO SAD SONG---I THINK IT'S GOING TO RAIN TODAY---TUSLA TURN AROUND---MORE THAN YOU COULD TAKE---NEW YEAR'S RESVOLUTION. This is just a sad, tired re-do of Helen Reddy."
3,The beginning of the end.,"Brian K. Vaughan, Runaways: Escape to New York (Marvel, 2006)The runaways meet up with some old pals after one of them is framed for assault, and have to find out who the real bad guy is, which leads them into the underworld of New York drug rings. Not a bad volume at all, though it feels somewhat disconnected from the rest of the series (and in hindsight is where it started its decline). ***"
5,Brio Magnetic Action Crossing,I purchased this for the Grandkids to play with at my house and they always want to take it home with them. This is a great little additon.
4,Almost perfect,"This tooth brush is almost perfect. My teeth always feel great afterwards. Sometimes my gums are a little soar after changing the head, but that only lasts a few hours.I have noticed that the bottom of the toothbrush can be a bit messy. I run it under the water and put it on the charger, but the bottom of the base & sink gets messy, not matter how well i rinse it. The very bottom of the toothbrush also gets a tiny bit crusty."
3,Works well but may not be environmentally friendly,"I have had the Oral B Vitality toothbrush for about a year. It really does a great job, and my last dental visit was my best ever - no cavities or gum issues, my dentist was impressed. I've tried both the single and dual action heads, and have a preference for the latter (it just feels like it cleans better).However, I have one major complaint. After only a year, the toothbrush has stopped charging. (This after I fully discharged and recharged it regularly, like they say you should.) I suspect everything in the product works well, except for the rechargeable battery locked inside. However, I must now throw away the entire thing - charger, plug and all - because I cannot change the Ni-Cd battery itself.Braun, please make this product more environmentally friendly..."
1,Dead Battery | Replace | Another Dead Battery,"Had one for 2 years, and it died of a dead battery. Got another one and it lasted 1 year and now will not take a charge."
3,Not worth the price--at ANY price,"I purchased this item a year or so ago. The start/stop button was two separate areas, which was excellent, not one like this one, which only had one for the on/off button. Poor design for sure!At best, this one with the multi-function button will last about 6 months, tops!If manufacturers are concerned about the environment with the so-called green movement, then why don't they make their products to LAST like they did in the OLDEN days. I'll tell you why, GREED!This is better than the lower price $6.00 type items, but don't expect it to last a year."
4,good,"I have the toothbrush for a while now. The battery don't seem to last what it suppose to. I average brush my teeth 1.5 times a day, and 2 minutes each time. But I have to charge it almost every other week. It's my first electric tooth brush, I bought it because of the good reviews I read here, and it didn't disappoint me. I like the small brushhead, it can each all places inside my mouth. It's pretty loud when it's on, but it's bearable when the bathroom door is closed, to not distract others."
4,Good price for a quality product,"I have used this toothbrush for about a month now and I am very happy with the way it works. I find the two minute timer buzzer most useful, as it enables me to brush sufficiently without overdoing it as I did earlier. I love the fact that it is rechargeable since I have stopped using many older electric toothbrushes as soon as the battery runs out. It is not too bulky, making it convenient to carry on trips as well. My only complaint with this brush is that it stains my countertop with the water left behind after rinsing the brush after use. Overall, I would recommend this to someone looking for an inexpensive rechargeable electric toothbrush."
5,Best Cleaning,"My Oral-B Vitality Precision Clean Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush performs better than expected. This is my second Braun electric toothbrush, the frist one, 11 years old, finally died. The new one has more power and does an even better cleaning, my dentist can attest to that. The price was unbelieavable and well worth it."
5,great,"I prefer the oscillating movement. This is a great brush. The head is small enough to reach absolutely everywhere, and on a full charge it's powerful enough to feel like you're flossing too! We bought them at Amazon for around $12, a promo price that comes around every once in a while. At that price it's barely more than a disposable battery brush, but far more effective in my opinion. Also the charger is very compact, so the footprint on the bathroom counter is not even an issue."
4,I love my clean teeth!,"This was a replacement for my old electric toothbrush that died. I had spent quite a bit of money on the other one and it lasted a couple years. To my delight, this one does the same job as the other. This gives me the same results and saves some money. Gotta love that."
2,Stopped Working,"It worked great for just over a year, then decided it was time to go to that big, toothbrushey place in the sky. (it lost power over the course of a week, then died. Probably the battery, as I saw mentioned by others, back when I bought it.) I would give it 3 stars, just for working well while it worked, but $20 is far more than you pay for 1 year of regular toothbrushes. Also, it's depressing to have something like this die on you."
4,A real work-horse,"I've been using this model of the Oral-B toothbrush for almost 2 years. It works great, but I do find the timer feature to be quite annoying. The timer activates at least 2 or 3 times during my brushing session. I'm not quite sure what purpose it serves, and there doesn't seem to be any way to deactivate it. Mechanically, this device has worked flawlessly. I've had no problems with it maintaining a proper charge, and all of the brush heads (I've gone through a couple of dozen) have worked without any malfunctions of any sort. Best of all, my teeth are cleaner and whiter since I started using this product."
3,Decent for $20,"I bought this approximately one year ago when it was only $16.99. It worked well... much better than regular (manual?) toothbrushes and my dentist noticed a difference. I like that it signals after 2 minutes of brushing time since I tend to not brush long enough otherwise. Maybe that's why my dentist noticed a difference.The toothbrush broke after about 9 months of use. No biggie for a toothbrush that was less than $20. However, as I am writing this review the toothbrush is selling for $40, which makes it not worth it anymore. I have since upgraded to the ""Oral-B 1000 Professional Care 1000 Electric Toothbrush"" which I also ordered from Amazon. It's priced at $48 and I would definitely recommend spending that extra $8. The ""Oral-B 1000 Professional Care 1000 Electric Toothbrush"" feels like it has more rotations per minute, and just feels much better in general. I am going to assume that it will last me more than 9 months as well."
1,Disappointed with Braun Oral B Vitality toothbrush,This is the second Braun electric toothbrush I have owned. While I am happy with the way it cleans my teeth I am extremely disappointed with permanent gradual unsightly blackening of the rubber grip part of the handle. Proctor and Gamble say that this part of the toothbrush is not covered by the warranty and is caused by not drying the toothbrush properly after use although I do this. I believe that the raised lines in the rubber make it difficult to dry properly and that a hard plastic handle would be preferable. In my view the materials used for the handle which is an integral part of the design do not stand up to normal bathroom use. When I emailed a reply to P&G I received only a request to complete a customer survey. I was not impressed and would avoid buying another toothbrush made with this material.
3,Not reliable long-term. Not suitable for international travel (220V),"I have been through many of these. Don't expect them to last more than a year. Unfortunately for the environment, it costs less to buy one of these every year than one more reliable model.My second issue is that the base only works on 110V. I cannot take this brush with me when I travel, since I cannot recharge it. Adding a transformer in the bathroom is not practical. I'm sure some more expensive models work on worldwide voltage, but due to overall unreliability of all those toothbrushes, I refuse to buy one. If one carried a warranty of at least 3 years, I would."
3,"Great in the beginning, but doesn't last","Be careful and save the packaging and warranty information if you buy this brush. While it is a good brush for a good price, mine didn't last for 9 months before it started losing its ability to hold a full charge. Now, after having it for 13 months, I can only use it 3-4 times before it needs to be recharged! So, I just called the phone number in the package insert, and complained. They are sending me a new one! (There are no service centers where I live). This is a good buy, and I like the fact that it fits multiple kinds of brush heads. The 2 minute timer is nice as well. But, this brush was not built to last. (Though what, nowadays, is??) The key is to complain and get your money back or hold the company up to its warranty. Thankfully, this brush comes with a 2 year warranty."
4,Some nice features,"Oral-B products are always good. What makes this one stand out from the pack is the two-minute timer that changes the speed momentarily to let you know that you've been brushing the minimum two minutes. The price is reasonable (although replacement heads don't come cheap). Still, in the war for good dental hygiene this is a formidable weapon."
5,Works like a charm & price is right!,"Was going to spend more on another brand but decided to give Oral B a try. Just the right size, battery holds adequate charge, timer works great, makes my mouth and teeth look & feel spectacular! The handle is small but works for me since I have small hands. Gets in all the nooks and crannies no problem. Also works in the shower. I love brushing my teeth now. Add flossing and a mouth rinse & your dental checkups will shine! Can buy 5 more and still come out ahead. Thanks Oral B!!"
3,Small and compact,Great size for traveling. Makes brushing a little more fun! On/off mechanism is not very sensitive.
4,Works great and at a great price.,The toothbrush works great and definitely better than expected for just paying $20. Definitely a must buy.
5,2min & 2 times a day keeps the Dentist away.,"Best tooth brush- 2 min for 2 times will keep the dentist away for cleaning your teeth. I am dentist and would recommend it to any one who is not interested in spending lots of $$ on more expensive stuff. This would be the best start up brush for any change from your manual to electric brush"""
2,Recharge problems,"For the price you cant beat this product, IF the problem I'm experiencing can be solved.I bought two of these brushes, one for my home bathroom and one for my work-out bag. Love the price and timer feature...But it seems that once I've used up the power in the brush, it wont recharge properly. I'm experiencing this problem with both brushes no matter how long I leave it in the charger.If there is a simple fix for this then I'd say 5 stars. If not, then 2 Stars is well earned, seeing as how I've been on their support line waiting (as I type this) for over an hour."
5,Oral B electric toothbrush,"First rechargeable electric that I have owned and I'm very pleased with the results. I don't know if the more expensive models offer more value but I can't imagine that they clean any better. The 2 minute timer is handy, comfortable to hold, teeth feel clean when finished. Very pleased with the purchase."
5,Works for everything,"This great little tool not only works to clean your teeth, but it cleans a lot of other things too. I use it to clean the water line in the toilet, the grout in the shower, my belly button, toe and finger nails, and all kinds of other things. My wife enjoys it too. After all this, it still cleans my teeth as clean as can be.This little gem would make a great bingo prize."
3,Good product,"I bought this toothbrush for myself and I think this is a good product. The rotating bristles are good enough to clean your teeth thoroughly.However, I would give it 3 stars because there is one design flaw and that is you need to hold the grip up by at least 30 degrees otherwise the toothpaste-saliva thing from your mouth flows back into rotating steel thing on which the bristles are attached.This is unhygienic and bad for the electric motor inside.I wonder if others have had the same problem.Overall good for the price."
2,oral b vitality precision clean toothbrush,I bought 2 of these and the item seems to shut off for 1-2 seconds here and there. Both toothbrushes do this. i still use them but I just wish they wouldn't shut off like something inside isn't wired right
1,Broke after a day of use,"Is there a review with less than one star? The brush is stopped working after one day of use. Customer support says I just didn't charge it enough. They informed me to charge the brush for 16 hours. I have done so, but it is still not working."
2,Disappointed,The Oral B Vitality Precision clean does not have the run time my old Oral B had. After a full charging I am fortunate to get three days out of it before putting it back on the charging stand.
2,You get what you pay for.......,"I bought this toothbrush about a week ago and ive already thrown it in the trash. The head on the brush hardly moves, it feels like its just vibrating more then anything else. I dont understand how others think this is a good brush....."
5,Excellent Product,"My family has been using this product for years. Simple, but efficient. The two minute timer is handy. I just replaced my last Oral-B rechargeable toothbrush after 8 years of use. The replacement heads are on the expensive side, but shop around and get a four pack when they are on sale."
1,Save your money,"Save your money. I have had 2 of these. The first one worked for a week before is suddenly stopped working. I bought a 2nd one thinking 'how bad can it be twice in a row?' I found out. The 2nd one never ever worked. I know it was only $20, but Oral can't make something that works at all? This is the worst product I ever purchased. What is worse is that there are only 2 customer service centers in my state and both over an hour drive. Look elsewere for an electric toothbrush."
3,Oral B electric Toothbrush,"Not as good as my Professional Model Oral B. Would I buy another one? Probably not! However, I would buy another Professional model in a heart beat. It's the best electric toothbrush on the market today."
4,Great toothbrush!,"I started using this toothbrush at the recommendation of my dental hygienist and I love it. I've had the toothbrush for two years and just finally replaced it. It wasn't replaced because it stopped working, though its battery life off the charger is pretty bad now, but I just wanted an upgrade. This is a great, no frills toothbrush to use when switching from manual to powered toothbrushes. Beware of the adjustment your gums undergo during the switch, which is why this is a good starter because the head spins much slower than my new 3000."
3,Good product - poor replacement heads,"This is a good electric toothbrush, but all the replacement heads I've purchased since have been defective. The lose a small metal pin and then the head bobbles about."
4,Yes and No,Yes:A good hygene tool. Brushes thorughly with flossing tip.Charge lasts reasonably long on new model.No:I've had two of the older model and the motors wore out more quickly than I expected.
4,Good for the price.,"For around 15 bucks, this rechargeable brush does a good job. My teeth feel cleaner compared to using a manual brush. I haven't used any of the more expensive ones (those over $100), so can't really say how this compares to those. However, compared to manual brushing, this is easier and more fun to use. So you actually look forward to brushing, which I guess has to be good for your teeth in the long run.As for the brush head, I think its small enough that it can reach those wisdom teeth at the back, but its large enough to fully surround a molar. To get a feel for how well it scrubs against my teeth, I gently pressed it against my tongue and I must say it does a much better job than a manual brush.The 2-minute timer is helpful, although I go about three minutes to satisfy myself."
4,Better than the expensive one,"I bought this to replace a much more expensive Oral-B model that we lost on a recent vacation. Surprisingly, this one cleans just as well. In fact, its lack of high-tech scrubbing motion is a plus for me; this brush doesn't feel like it's forcuing my jaws apart. If you really need an LCD screen on your toothbrush, spring for the more expensive version, but if you just want clean teeth, save your $80."
5,Power Toothbrush,The small round shape of brush is perfect for my teeth. That was the primary reason I chose this item.
4,Better than my expensive Sonicare,"After two expensive Sonicares lost their power, I read a positive review for this Oral-B electronic toothbrush. I ordered it and it did not disappoint. I've been using it for over a month and it satisfies for a fraction of the price.One thing to note: It comes with a hard bristle brush. I ordered the extra soft and am very satisfied."
1,Battery will not take a charge,I bought this product for my son 3 months ago. It will no longer take a charge. Can't recommend this product if it only lasts 3 months.
5,Great Product,Product well worth the cost. Holds a charge for over two weeks. Easy to grip handle. Very quiet.
4,"Blue brush made in Mexico, Green made in Germany","It's definitely a great brush!Took off one star because it comes with a small head, while the green one comes with a regular toothbrush kind of head.I didn't realize this and I ended up buying a regular head which added to the cost.I have both, blue and green, and they both work well.The only issues are:- It's a NiCd battery which means it'll have the memory effect- If the battery dies, you have to wait at least 8 hours before you can use it, so either keep it charged all the time, or have a backup brush.(If it matters to you:)For whatever reason, the blue one is made in Mexico and the green one is made in Germany.The heads are all made in Germany."
4,Recommended Highly,This product was recommended by my dentist. My wife and I both have them now and they are very effective in keeping our teeth cleaned and polished. Amazon had the best price and is most efficient getting the product to you.
5,very good product for the price,"i wouldn't hesitate to order this item again if necessary. i would, however, purchase this item for use with batteries and not the rechargeable kind (takes up outlet space that i need for other items)."
5,Great price!,"I've been using Oral B tooth brush for more than 5 years. Of course, I've tried sonicare and other electric tooth brush; however, I like oral b more.For the price of $20/each at walmart, I replace my older tooth brush with a new one every 6 months or so. This might sound like a waste of money since they are brush heads available; however, 1) brush head is $7.50 each 2)battery is irreplaceable and weakened greatly after 6 months. Brush head last pretty long, I brush twice a day and about 5-8 minutes each time.This model is especially good because of the price, and it also cleans really well. My teeth are squeaky clean & no cavity.For $14/each, i'll stock them up!"
5,Electric toothbrush - Oral-B,This Oral-B electric toothbrush is both inexpensive and an excellent performer. Hands down beats manual brushing for getting teeth clean quickly and effectively massaging gums.
5,Great product,"Great product. Love the fact it does not overcharge, and can be left on the charger. Feels powerful on each use. Leaves my teeth feeling clean, and do not feel like I need to brush for hours or use a great deal of pressure when brushing."
5,As Good as it Gets,"Easy to care for, quick to recharge; has all the features necessary for good oral hygiene. The timer is a plus, as is size ( no storage problem with this compact unit). Good buy for the money."
2,OK at first,"I have had this for a year. It no longer holds a charge. The grip gets filthy really fast. The place where the brush head connects to the handle gets filthy fast also. The bottom which sits on the charger and the charger itself get moldy if you place your brush on it after you brush. You have to let it completely dry, but then it dies and you have no charge for brushing. Some major design flaws."
2,Does not charge to 20 min worth even after 24 hours,"Even after leaving it to charge for more than 24 hours, brush does not last more than 40 secs."
2,Where do you get refills,I love this tooth brush but where do you get refills. I can not find them anywhere and they are so expensive. they cost more then the tooth brush alone. so if anyone has an idea please let me knowjongale64@comast.net
1,Objectionable Packaging,"I employ heavy duty shears to open packages like these, much to my chagrin. This package, worse than others of its ilk, had difficult to reach edges so be prepared for a real battle to get it open...Also look very closely to locate highly camouflaged battery direction indicators...Once you get the toothbrush in your hands and batteries installed correctly it works quite well. These packages are designed for prevention of in store tampering and theft (sensor sealed within package) but demonstrate a contempt for the consumer. Amazon should insist on ""mail order"" packaging."
3,A great economy unit,"This works well as a basic poered toothbrush, though it is slower than the more deluxe Braun units. Well worth the 2o bucks or so it sells for."
4,Oral-B Vitality Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush,"Why on earth did they modify the physical shape of the interface between the brush and the charger from the ""standard"" fitting on earlier units? Maybe there's a technical reason that is not obvious but the change precludes using earlier charging bases that provide for brush storage. The brush unit itself is fine and I would recommend."
5,great product,"this is my first power toothbrush, and i'm lovin it, easy to use, really clean up the corner teeth inside out well."
2,Problems with Power Dying,"Bought two of these on Sept 23, 2009. One for my wife and one for me. Recommended by my dentist who said it should be as good as more expensive models.At first, my wife had problems with her unit holding a charge but it seems to be running OK now. However,two days ago while rinsing my unit and cleaning the brush under the faucet my power unit simply quit. I tried recharging it but all I get now is a little whirring sound but no action of the brush.I think the Braun Oral-B should hold up a lot longer than that, even at the low end price. I'll probably end up tossing it and purchasing a highly rated higher end Braun model."
5,A bargain that really works,"For the first time in a long time, I finally have found toothbrush that really makes your mouth feel clean. It is programmed for a 2 minute warning which really makes me brush longer than I used to. It's strong and doesn't shatter your mouth like some of the ""vibrating brushes"" I found this a welcome change to my dental care and highly recommend it to any and all.....and you just can't beat the price.Oral-B Vitality Precision Clean Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush"
4,Electric toothbrush,"Having used electric spin brushes for a few years now, I have become a firm believer. The big reason is, my dentist only has to do a little cleaning and spends a very short time on me. ""Disgustingly healthy"" is how he once joked about my teeth. Also, brushing is much less work."
5,Great product,This is almost exactly the same as the Braun it is replacing. The Braun lasted more than 15 years. I don't use the timer...I brush longer than the timer. Great value (under $20) and I recommend.
4,Oral-B Vitality,"Was hesitant to purchase an expensive rechargeable toothbrush without first trying one out. Discovered this Oral-B model and took it out for a test drive. Have not been to the dentist yet but believe that he will be pleasantly surprised. After each 'brushing,' the teeth feel squeaky clean."
4,Very good,"I've used this brush daily for 3 years and it's as good as new. I've had 2 other Braun rechargeable brushes which were much more expensive. This one is just as effective and powerful. The 2 minute timer is very useful as well. I'd like to comment on some reviewers charging problem. Since the battery is a NiCad so if you remove it from the charger before it's completely charged it can't be charged fully UNLESS you let it run down to nothing and recharge from there. The replacement brushes are expensive so I bought CVS replacements. That was a mistake, I'm back to the Braun made brushes. My dentist comments about how well maintained my teeth are now."
4,Good Power Toothbrush,"I previously owned a $200 Oral B Poower Toothbrush set, which came with two brushes and a nice stand/charger. After two months with the Vitality, the only significant difference I can see between the two brushes is the Vitality lacks the 30 second intermediate timer that prompts you to move on the the next quadrant of your mouth. For a $160 savings, I'm finding a way to suffer through without that functionality."
1,Died after 6 weeks,"The brush died after 6 weeks of light use, alternating with a manual brush. In the meantime, the metal melted and caused noticeable taste and probably can be attributed for some metal accumulation on a tooth. This is not worth it even at this price."
2,Don't bother with the cheap one,"I've been using some type of Oral B ""spinny"" toothbrush for years. My old one just died so I bought this one thinking that the price had come down a lot in the last 3-4 years. Apparently not. This one's a lot less expensive but you can tell. I *LOVE* the Oral B line of electric toothbrushes, but don't waste your time with the $20 version. But the $80+ ones - they really are that much better. This one spins so poorly; I know I'm not getting the cleaning I've enjoyed for years. I returned mine and bought the better version and am now very happy."
4,good deal,"It's OK. I just turned to electric toothbrush and feel good about it till now. It can keep powerful for about one week or less once full charged (16 hrs). And it's safe for charging even in the bathroom, because you cannot see any metal material under the bottom of the toothbrash and the surface of the base."
4,Does what it says on the label,"I live in the UK and have the same product in the 240V version. I bought this to use while I travel in the US. The products are comparable in quality and function, although I think the 240V version recharges more quickly. I Can't see the point of paying 2-3 times the price for a product that does exactly the same and uses the same brushes."
4,Oral B Review,The product shipped promptly and has worked as advertised. We were pleased with the price.
5,Kids love it,"It's a great way to get kids to brush their teeth well. For the price, it's one-third the price that I paid for mine and is a good starter for them to get in the habit of using it"
4,Good Oral-B,Purchased to replace an older model which lasted a few years. Good cleaning action; hopefully it lasts as long as previous one.
2,Not useful for experienced editors,"I bought this book because I was having several technical issues for a long form project and I was hoping to get some insight into solving those problems. However, there was no pertinent information for trouble shooting my issues.This is probably a great book for a beginner but if you are experienced at all, you won't find any useful information here."
2,Big Disappointment,"This book is suprisingly bad, considering that it's put out by Avid. I agree completely with the other reviewer who compared this book unfavorably with the Final Cut Pro books put out by Apple's Training Series. Those books have clear exercises and go through the processes you're learning in a thorough step-by-step way. This book doesn't even explain the interface clearly. Then, suddenly you are instructed to hit keys that have never been mentioned before. The writer doesn't even tell you what footage he's working with most of the time. A real disaster."
2,Volume 2 is SO much better...,"One of my frequent CD choices is 'John Lewis Volume 2 - The Bridge Game' based on Bach's The Well Tempered Clavier Book 1. Because I really liked this CD, I bought Volume 1 (not easy, because it was recorded in 1984 and is no longer being made) and it's a big disappointment. Bach's preludes and fugues are beautiful pieces but when seen through the John Lewis sextet lens, they don't work anywhere near as well as The Well Tempered Clavier. It's back to Volume 2 for me..."
3,The auditory equivalent of being snow blind,"This exploration of Japanese themed music on ""Hai!"" strikes many interesting chords with the powerful drumming that energizes and defines the songs, the chants and shouts, cultural touchstones (e.g., Godzilla, City Island, Tantara). Collaborators Siouxsie Sioux and Budgie manage to harness enough energy for a good ride, but after a couple of listens, the territory appears the same and the result is the auditory equivalent of being snow blind. That is, the songs tend to blend together, melded by the wonderful drumming, and they inhabit a middle space without any soaring moments or any dreadful stumbles save the second half of the final song.This consistency on ""Hai!"" yields a CD that is one the one hand unified and level but on the other a bit numbing for listening straight through. I think these tracks works better fragmented and scattered among other music (e.g., compilation, noncommercial radio, DJ) than as a block."
5,Spellbinding,"Turn off the lights, close your eyes, and get lost in this haunting and beautiful collection of sounds.This wasn't an album made for MTV. This wasn't an album made for the ""mainstream"".This is an album made for the sake of creativity and purity of expression alone.Imagoró!"
4,surprising and satisfying,"I've followed the Banshees and the Creatures for a long time, but I didn't necessarily have high expectations for this. Not many artists can make engaging and challenging music 25 years into their career. I've enjoyed the Creatures pop material too, but I was pleased to see this return to roots. When they began The Creatures offshoot, it was always about Budgie banging the hell out of his drums with Siouxsie singing sweet nothings. On this new release, Budgie sounds like a tribal, gothic drumeline and Siouxsie has rarely sounded better. No hit singles, but what struck me was how well this album flows and how enjoyable it is to listen to in its entirety in one sitting. It fades in, rumbles along, turns dark and sensual and then ramps back up again at the end. An unexpected treat."
5,sorry if you're seeking pop-cohesive crap!,"no, this isn't the album one might be seeking if they're big fans of Anima Animus. This album harks back to the brilliant days of the Wild Things EP and their first official album, Feast. Together, Hai forms a solid narrative based on rich percussion and Asian influenced rythym and drumming thanks to Budgies sincere appreciation for his craft. As much as I love Sioux, this album could have been made without her, though her vocals do add an intriguing layer of sonic pleasure to the disc. But special props go to Budgie, quite possibly one of the greatest drummers of our generation. Brilliant, and worth every penny! Just say Hai!"
2,Sorry Siouxsie!,"I want to love the Creatures, but this anti-melodic, leaden album doesn't help. I was hoping Hai! would deliver the promise made with Anima Animus...great electro-rock songs with goth flair. Wrong. This is more akin to their tribal Feast album than any other Creatures material. It's an okay album, but a disappointment if you like pop. Very thumping, chanting stuff here, not much song structure, and hopeless at yielding a viable single. Sorry Siouxsie!"
2,Failed Experiment,"I don't understand how anyone could give this a 4 or 5 stars. I've tried to appreciate it several times, but its torture to try to listen to all the way thru. Not all experiments can be successful. I don't believe they should have realeased this one. I gave it 2 stars instead of one because the drumming at the beginning of the album is very interesting and well done. The singing is almost non existant and seemingly nonmotivated when it does appear. The music is kind of sparse too, other than the drumming. Budgie could get one good drum solo out of this album to put with 12 different new songs for a new album. If this was Budgies showcase, well, artistic ego got in the way of good musical sense. Yes monotonous, uninspiring, fit the bill I had to pay. The only Siouxsie connected project ever, that I did not like."
5,Very Good Read,"This was a great story, written from a woman's perspective, of the goldrush. This book should be read by anyone who is looking for a first-person account of the lengths some people went to in the pursuit of gold."
2,Not what I was expecting,"This book tended to be a little disjointed, and never does reveal much about her brother and father in the gold fields. She may have acquired gold claims through others, but never actually worked any of them. However, it was interesting to see how she coped with winter and those she came into contact with. Once read is enough."
3,WHAT AN INSPIRING BOOK!,"This book gives a descriptive example of the life of teenager living in a nazi concentration camp, it's very moving! It's a very short but detailed book, it takes hardly any time at all to read at all! It would be a great resource to any research project related to this time period!"
5,Inspiring but sad,When i was told we had to read this i thought ok i'll read early and get it over with but know i know that this book is not boring it is very interesting and it only took me 2 hours to read it the first time. I recommend buying the cliff notes and the real book.
1,Just read the real book,Why would anyone need Cliff Notes on Night? The real book is only about 100 pages. Just read the book.
5,GREAT BOOK?,"Yes, of corse its a great book I had to read it for a school project, it took me 1 day. It's short and easy to get through once you get passed the first chapter. There are alot of details. I think that that is one thing that makes this book great. Another thing that I think makes this book great is just what it is about,the holocoust. Elie is a great author and I'm looking forward to reading another book of his soon. My advice get the book."
5,In-depth analysis for students,"Three new additions to Harold Bloom's 'Modern Critical Interpretations' ($36.95 each) series will reach high school into college levels, compiling critical articles from a variety of sources and offering the in-depth analysis students will need to assist on detailed reports of an author's single work. Joseph Heller's Catch 22 (0-7910-5927-8) provides articles which examine how the sane can survive under insane wartime circumstances; Elie Wiesel's Night (5924-3) gathers critical writings on his story of life in a Nazi concentration camp, and the focus on Tolkien's Lord Of The Rings (5665-1) considers the contents and impact of the three-volume epic fantasy. All include essays by notable critics who offer different interpretations and focus perfect for classroom discussion or essay pursuit."
4,"this book, it is to little font","Everyone who says that book is about 100 pages(which is true) are really incorrect. If you look at the font size it is probley about 200 pages if you read the entire book. Well this book is pretty good, but sad. Just becasue i said that you should still read the book."
1,How can cliff notes sum up a survivor's story?,"I am truly horrified that people actually read the cliff notes to this book. It is a wonderful yet truthfully sad story about Elie Wiesel's experience during the Holocaust, and the fact that someone would be ignorant enough to read the cliff notes is truly disappointing. This novel is a true story about an event in history where 12,000,000 people (6,000,000 of them Jewish)were tortured and murdered by the Nazi's. In order for history to not repeat itself, it is important for people to read the stories about these incredible people who survived the Holocaust. Please do not cheat yourself of this experience. It is well worth it in order to ensure that no one will ever forget this part of history"
5,Skip Cliff's Notes-READ THE BOOK,***** (5 STARS) For the Book Night (Not the Cliffs Notes). It's a true account of a 15 year old boy's experience in the concentration camps run by the Nazis. I first read this book as an aide in a 10th grade literature class a few years ago. Researching the Holocaust has become a big part of my life. Night is an extremely moving piece of writing. ALL teenagers should read it.
1,Give me a break.,Just read the book. Its a wonderful book and you can read it over a weekend. You don't need cliff notes.
1,OY!,Forget this Cliff Notes crap! Just read Night. It's a great book and it won't even take you long to read. I wish I could give this Cliff Note book zero stars.
1,C'mon you can read the real thing,"""Night"" is one of the most important (semi-autobiographical) novels around. It is one of those books that makes you think, to say the least. Better still, it is just 100 pages or so. I read it in one night - no kidding. It does not make any sense at all to read the Cliff Notes version; in the time it takes you to purchase the Cliff Notes and read it, you could have read the actual book in its full 100 page glory. (and still had time to contemplate its profound implications) Now if we were talking about Jane Eyre or Dickens or Anna Karenina it might at least be understandable. But with Night, do yourself a favor and read the real thing."
1,Ridiculous!,"The book is only like 120 small pages -- read it! Having cliff notes to something like this is stupid -- a) because it is so short to begin with and b) from a practical point of view, anything that you are going to be asked to write based on this book is going to be rather emotional, or at least intense, as the subject is, and getting the facts and dates without FEELING it is not going to help you write a decent essay anyway. You would be lucky to get a D on an essay on this book written on the basis of these notes!"
1,Don't insult such a great novel by reading the Cliff Notes,"I'm in complete agreement with hobbes. I mean, c'mon, how long can it possibly take to read a hundred pages?!? The Cliff Notes are nearly as long! Night is an amazing, brilliant novel, pure art; get the real thing."
4,Blast from the past,"Rooftop Prince is another SBS (TV network) drama that successfully mixes fantasy and adds enjoyable twists into otherwise rather mundane drama, as do ""Secret Garden"" and ""My Girlfriend is Kumiho"".The story is just too contrived. The pieces are forced too much to fit together and there are too many ""why would anybody do that?"" and ""that is just asinine"". The characters lack depth also. Bad guys are all cookie-cutter bad guys who seemingly want just money at the cost of everything else, and good guys are all innocent angels. However the killer conclusion that is equally moving and satisfying makes you forget a lot of those flaws, and it will bring tears to the eyes of even the hardest man."
1,Amatueristic,"I am a Tai Chi instructor with fourteen years of Authentic kung fu and tai chi experience and my wife is a licensed massage therapist. We watched the video and found nothing to do with Tai Chi, poor body mechanics, and an overall lacking of knowledge by Mr. Klein of therapudic technique. In fact, this video was viewed at the same time by my wife's instructors and coworkers. My wife's teacher is not only a licensed massage therapist but also a registered nurse and a licensed physical therapist also. Their assessment was unanimous. ""It stinks."" I give this video one star instead of none because there were no animals harmed during the making of this video."
1,Waste of money,I'm a massage therapist and found the information on this video to be contradictory to my training and experience. I don't reccommend it to anyone.
1,Why would you pay this price when you can get 30Gs for same?,"I just don't understand why anyone would pay the crazy price sony wants for 2Gs of space that you could get a whole video ipod with 30Gs of space for the same price? Sony has cut it's own throat in the race to provide mobile movies. They are so proprietary on their media control that there is no way this is going to work for them. Other than the fact that it plays some great games, it's completely useless and bulky for mobile music or movies. AND pricey to boot! I can store more than 30 full-length movies on my 30G ipod and to do the same on Sony's device, would cost me $3,000 on the PSP!!!! Do the math. It don't add up in Sony's favor."
3,it was great....till it dropped,I got this for my K750i and worked great for a yea....until I dropped the phone with the card in it...the phone works great...can't say the same for the card. It broke inside the phone and had to shake it to get the bits out. I noticed the plastic they used was flimsy compared to the original 64mb that came with the phone. Oh well...just be careful with it.
4,Sony Memory Stick PRO Duo works great,"Purchased this for my new Sony Cyber Shot DSC T100 camera and it works great. Not sure if the High Speed helps any over the regular speed. Can't seem to find any technical information on the fastest transfer rate for the T100 camera. Purchased mine from (...) (a long-time camera mail order store with a good reputation) when it was on special in May-2006 for about (...) (full retail package). This one runs at 10MB/sec; San Disk now has an Ultra edition which runs at 18MB/sec. Again, not sure whether devices can take advantage of that speed. Gets only 4 stars because it's hard to LOVE a stick of memory."
3,Sony 2GB Sony High Speed Memory Stick,I ordered the Sony 2GB High Speed Memory Stick and received the Sony Pro Duo which isn't High Speed. There is about a $30 difference. We'll see what happens!
5,Best value,"These are my favorite of the Pro Duo series.With more than adequate capacity and a very quick load time, they are really the best value.The 4GB version obviously offers better storage but, currently, the high-speed version of that size is much more expensive and, the standard version is a bit slow to load.For good storage, a quick load and a low price this is the way to go."
3,Wanted to like it - bad backlight bleed,"I really wanted to like this monitor. It is solidly built and has great features like the USB ports and multiple inputs. That said, I found the backlight bleed on the top and bottom of the screen to be unbearable. It was not all that noticable for most applications, like running a MS Office or browsing the internet, but when playing a game or watching a DVD, it was really prominent. When running a DVD player into the component inputs, the monitor adds black bands to compensate for the widescreen image. The bleed was so strong as to be a real distraction from the DVD. Also, when playing games the have a lot of darkness (e.g. Unreal Tournament) the bleed was again very distracting.If it weren't for the bleed I would still own this monitor. Since I want a monitor for watching DVDs as well as to use with my computer, I returned it."
2,Not what it seems,"I picked up an LG L226WT the other day and I like it. Then I was at a local Box store and saw this Gateway. It had quite a few more features and it was only $20 more so I picked it up with the thought that I could return the LG since it was only a couple days old.So I hooked this up and voila. It was crummy. The bleed through is VERY noticeable even though others say it is ok. Don't believe it. I guess if you have a bright screen color you may not notice, but with Black, the bleed is all the way around. Very poor. I hooked the LG L226WT back up and it is again a very nice picture. Don't bother with the Gateway. I found out is is made by Samsung by the way, which should be good."
1,I hate it,"i don't find it to be bright an clear or sharp. Also my mouse keeps getting lost off the bottom and left side of the screen. Maybe it ir just an adjustment, but I find the adjustments difficult to manage. And my major complaint is Technical Support! After updating to windows Vista the USB ports stopped working. I called Gateway and they would offer me no advice because the monitor was not bought as a system but rather individually. So I guess I have to wait till someone who got a system with this monitor complains and Gateway decides to fix it. No more Gateways for me."
1,Bonnie,15 months of service and it dies! One year of warranty unlike their competition. The company pretty much said tuff. Buy another brand with a warranty and will stand behind their products.
3,Great monitor - 1 major flaw,"This is an amazing monitor. It has a clear picture, bright screen, and great controls. It also has tons of great options such as a usb hub and inputs for DVI, VGA, and some home theater hookups. The only major problem is with the backlight bleed. There are two bright casts on the top and bottom that are only viewable when watching a movie or playing a dark game that interfere with your view. Its a great monitor but i'm personally going to take it back until they can release a product that has does a better job keeping the backlight bleed down."
2,Great Monitor,"I received the monitor and was extremely happy that it matched the other monitor that I already had, however just after the 90 days the monitor quit working. What to do? the the back light doesn't work, what to do?"
2,Avoid if you have no electronics repair skills,"These are typical cheapo LCD monitors with capacitor issues. I have one on my bench right now for repairs; they are insanely hard to crack open but simple to fix. Just need to replace a few caps in the power supply, and I have seen bad ones on the video board before as well.I am giving this two stars because while it has good picture quality, it is not a reliable product and the average person would not be able to fix it. Gateway won't stand behind their garbage, either. That said, there is absolutely no difference between this and any other brand...you do NOT get what you pay for, every manufacturer uses cheap capacitors that blow up."
1,Junk!! 2 monitors died within 3 days...bought at same time!!,"It's junk. I got the ""white screen of death"" just as some of the other users on TWO monitors bought at the same time within 3 days of each other. It happened suddenly just after the warranty ran out conveniently. Ya gotta wonder how so many people have had the same problem so soon after the warranty expires. Any disbelievers? Google it!! Don't waste your money!"
2,One year and 2 months. Thats all.,"After one year and two months it died. Will only display a solid white screen. Gateway warranty is only one year. Gateway said ""sorry it is out of warranty"". They will not even repair it at my expense. I am out the money and the monitor. Look for a company with a better and longer warranty!"
5,Pea Soup!,"I've been looking for some whole yellow peas to make pea soup Swedish style. I'm originally from Sweden and boy, did I miss Swedish yellow pea soup! These peas were perfect for it! I now have several large batches of frozen pea soup, and I will be buying more of these peas when I run out!"
3,Mainly a history of nuclear power,This book has a potentially fascinating theme but the author did not carry it out very well. A great deal of emphasis on nuclear power and little original on anything else.
1,Kaplan SAT/ACT/PSAT Deluxe 2002,"I bought the program three months ago and the company hasn't responded to our emails or telephone inquiries. Very, very poor customer service. The software doesn't work and the company refuses to respond or replace the item. Due to software glitches, we cannot use the program. Definitely a waste of money and no assistance to my daughter."
1,Very Child like,"When I bought this program I wanted software that would allow me to comfortabley study for the SAT. When I installed it onto my computer I found a program that seems to target the elementry school age child. I started resenting opening the program to study because of the childlike program. I was hopeing for something more ""adult"". Something meant for me. Someone who wants to go to college."
5,Hough Scores Big Time,"Stephen Hough, by no means less thann one of the top five (IMO) performing pianists today, delivers a phenomenal contribution to the Hyperion Romantic Piano Concerti Series here. The Scharwanka, alone, would 'sell' this CD. A big but not sprawling Romantic Concerto that should be played more often, it is in the league of the Brahms 2, Tchaikovsky 2, and Dohnányi 1. The Sauer is almost a 'filler', but so ideal, that disc is just perfect! I've heard Hough several times in Concert: Hummell A minor; Rachmaninoff D minor; and this very Scharwenka 4 -- all with the Philadelphia Orchestra. The Orchestra was its sensational self, and I wish we could 'return' to the days when pianists such as Hough could record with the very best: Philadelphia; Boston; Chicago; London SO; and Berlin, on a regular basis. Just listen to the better playing of the Dallas SO in Hough's Rachmaniinoff set, for a 'taste' of what could be even better! So, Five Stars + for this wonderful CD! John Turner"
5,Best NEW book I've read in years,"Just finished reading Catherine Asaro's THE VEILED WEB. Couldn't put it down; she combines depth of characterization with superb action. Both Lucia and Rashid come alive for me, as well as several of the other characters.As a person with interests in both ballet and computers, and with many friends in intercultural marriages, the total effect on me was much more than the sum of its parts.I hope to see more of Rashid and Lucia, and their offspring, in the very near future."
1,Disappointed,Put the story down 1/3 of the way through. The female character was just too silly acting.
4,Dr. Asaro did lots of research for this one.,"While reading the Veiled Web I was amazed at how many religious, cultural, and technical references are made by the novel's wide variety of characters. The story's pace (like all of her books) flows quickly, and her characters are enjoyable. Like the main character in Catch the Lightning, Lucia is a young innocent girl who becomes involved with an older mysterious foreigner. The book at times got overly sentimental and sweet for my taste at times, although I didn't mind since I got my share of haunted, brooding war veterans in her Skolian stories."
1,Buyer beware!,"This is a romance novel disguised as a cyber-thriller. Not to put down romance novels as they are one of my guilty pleasures but if I see a book jacket picturing Fabio in a pirate costume getting jiggy with a bosomy woman I know what I am buying and how I am going to be spending my time. The hero and heroine were too beautiful to be believable and the plot too tidy. I felt as though the author owes me for the hours I spent reading this piece of fluff, thinking that I was going to learn about the morals of creating artificial intelligence, and along the route learn more about Islam. She could have spent more time there, she didn't -- my loss. For my next read I'll look for a historical romance (with or without Fabio on the cover) that doesn't pretend to be any more than it actually is."
2,Can't compare with her Skolian series,"It's hard to believe this is the same author who brought us into the fascinating world of her Skolian series. This novel is romance with just a dash of scifi/cyberpunk thrown in. Disappointing, at times even trite. But don't let this book turn you off of her other gems."
2,"A Failed Attempt at Romance, Adventure, Sci-fi","While I have enjoyed most of Ms. Asaro's novels immensely, I felt that The Veiled Web attempted to bring together a number of genres, but succeeded at none. The romance (the primary genre of the novel) felt unbelievable, since Rashid was absent during most of the period during which the Lucia's romantic feelings allegedly developed. If anything, the heroine became enamored of the lifestyle, rather than the man himself. The attempt to bring action/adventure elements into the novel through the element of the kidnappers felt similarly half-hearted, since only the first and last attempts had any crumb of excitement, and the characters (particularly Lucia) barely reacted to the attempts. The science-fiction elements succeeded perhaps better than the romance or the adventure - but anyone interested in reading about the development of consciousness in artificial intelligence would be better advised to re-read Robert Heinlein's _The Moon is a Harsh Mistress_."
1,an enormous disappointment,"I have all of the Skolian books, which I really enjoy but this book is going straight in the trash. I am also a big fan of romances and this is one of the most stilted, uninvolving stories I've read in a long time. The artificial intelligence part was really trite."
5,Bar Stool In Satin Black Finish Metal With Swivel Seat And Back 2 Pack,This is a great product. I bought these stools for my basement bar and I really happy with my decision. The look and feel is that of an expensive product.I had a very good experience with the seller because they are very responsive. They answered my questions within a few minutes of my asking.
2,Poor quality,"We bought this bar stool about two months ago. It took considerable time and effort to fix, as some of the holes were not properly aligned. We really liked it once it was fixed. The bar-stool was lightly used during this time. Now, the screws are coming apart and the bar-stool seat is wobbling. It has now become unsafe to use. I would recommend buying a better quality bar stool. It is not worth the money we paid for it. I will never buy products from this manufacturer."
3,"Not bad, not amazing.. very easy.","I got mine yesterday. They were very easy to assemble. They look decent, nothing great about them. I think they're a little pricy for what you get, but its not too big a deal. The padding is pretty stiff though. So I recommend changing the cushions. Also, the box they came in was severly damaged. The side of it looked like it had been sitting in water and the box was widely torn open in several spots. The chairs had some kind of orange dust on them.. took a while to clean."
4,A nice follow-up to One A.D.,"If you liked One A.D. for its trance-inducing beats and melodies, you really ought to travel to a different destination with Two A.D. Two A.D. is very much like its predecessor, only slightly more mellow. The tracks aren't quite as individual and different from one another as they were in One A.D. I'm quite pleased with 2, and I plan to buy Three A.D.."
1,Snooze...,"Did they have to try to include the entire history of Judaism from Abraham to the Maccabees. I found myself dozing off by the time they got to David and Bathsheba.Unfortunately, one of the weaknesses of this DVD, beside its long length, is the fact that we're told shockingly little of Jewish history after about 100 A.D. Therefore, not only does this DVD fail to entertain, it also maintains silences about current Jewish history. No Maimonides and Jewish Spain? No tales of Russian Jews? No Jews in the United States?I think ""Empires"" certainly failed with this edition. Definitely one to skip."
1,Historical Reductionism. A piece of junk,"Rather than sharing what the biblical authors claimed happened, from the very get-go, the Jewish scriptures are assumed to be made up with no evidence supported to substantiate that claim. From that foundation, Scripture is acknowledged to be ""morally edifying"" but not ""authoritative"" nor even ""accurate."" Theories trying to get behind the Biblical authors' intent in writing these fabricated tales are treated as totally true, though they are just unsubstantiated theories. Meanwhile, the claims that the biblical authors were writing an accurate history of past events is dismissed out of hand and those who might believe such a thing are laughed out of the room as childish, not even given a hearing.This is pure propaganda. Historical documents are dismissed as fiction while modern theories seeking to undermine Scriptures claim to authority are treated as fact.I do not recommend this series in any way whatsoever."
3,This is a good value,"...but while it is worth every penny for what you get (about 4 hours), it isn't exactly engrossing. It IS a good attempt at presenting one of the most formative eras of ancient and modern religion, and therefore a formidable challenge for the producers."
5,Exactly what I was looking for!,"This DVD is perfect for someone interested in learning more of the details of pilates movements. Whether a pilates trainer or student looking to enhance your movements Jennifer Kries gives many helpful hints and explanations. She says in the beginning that this shouldn't replace a certification program, but this is a great place to start if you are interested in knowing more without paying $5000 for a certification course right away."
2,Beware of This Fact,"I purchased a pilates reformer and then looked for instructional material. I found this product on Amazon. As this product had good reviews and because I thought I was getting five dvds as pictured with the item as it is presented on the Amazon page, I ordered it. I thought this would be a decent value - $40 for 5 dvds. If you are considering buying this go ahead - it may be a great product - but you will not be getting the pictured 5 dvds - just one. It still may be a good value and may be an excellent product but $40 for one dvd seems expensive and I only ordered it thinking I would receive 5 dvds. So I am thinking about returning it. Amazon - or the vendor/seller - should change the picture which accompanies the product heading."
5,Cairo Time,I loved the movie-Patricia Clarkson and Alexandar Siddig are amazing!!! There is so much unspoken dialog in this movie and the scenery is beautiful too. I wish more people would have heard about this movie and like me take the time to watch it and then fall in love with it as I have!!!
1,Deplorable sentimental pap.,"A total waste of the talents of Patricia Clarkson and the others involved in this project. As a travelogue, it makes me want to visit Cairo - perhaps it was financed by the Egyptian government? I have been to Cairo, and it is nothing like this - this is the sugar-coated version, a little like the image of Tokyo one gets from Lost in Translation. Cairo is teeming with homeless, poverty-stricken people, as is all of Egypt. But all we see here are genteel sophisticates. The plot is predictable and emotionally detached - we never really care about these characters, only their clothes and their luggage seems to matter to the director. This is trash of the first order. Don't believe the hype. It's not worth $18.99."
4,Wonderful Photographs,"This book contains full page photos, many of which I had never seen before. The clarity of the photographs is comparable to the digital photos we are able to take now. Although the book consists mainly of photos of buildings (of course) there are many which include pedestrians, carriages, automobiles, signs, etc. I think this book would be interesting to anyone studying Chicago, the history of the time period, architecture, clothing or photography, or to anyone who simply loves old photographs. The only complaint I have is that some of the photos were not dated. Very good book!"
2,Photographs of Chicago during the early 20th century,I have been to Chicago many years since I lived in IL from 1933 to 1963. My mother's people came to Chicago in the 1830's.I found the early photos extremely interesting as I am a former teacher of both high school & college history. I reall liked this book as I had seen it before & could not locate another copy until I saw it on Amazon.Many Thanks for stocking this item.
1,"Don't buy this one, buy the new re-mastered version!!","Don't get me wrong, I am obsessed with Kin. One of my all time best albums.But I just purchased it and then realized that there is a new (2010) re-mastered version that is better recorded.Search for B003CNF700."
1,Avoid at all costs!,"This is lowbrow electronica at its worst! There is not a single innovative or interesting thing on this album. Poor production and overall cheesiness reign supreme on this waste of perfectly good plastic. If you are a serious fan of good electronic music, save your time and money - don't buy this!In case anyone is interested, I took this CD to three music stores to trade it in and no one would even take it."
4,Great Chill Out,"I've recently been getting very much into the downtempo chill side of electronic music. Don't get me wrong I still love my Tangerine Dream and my Klaus Schulze, but when I need something that isn't so cosmic, I turn to this record. Most of the tracks on this album have great smooth beats with layers and layers of lush electronica over top. Providing the listener with a sense of forward movement that is never ever rushed. The only thing ever harsh is the opening tracks inital ""electro-buzz"" which quickly fades into cosmic pulses of sonic chillout. I'm very happy with this purchase. Check it out for yourself."
1,Don't bother buying this.,"Magellan does not support the older GPS units any longer. When you try to update, they will just try to sell you a newer GPS."
