1,Cat didn't like it,"While I'm sure many kitties love the stuff mine didn't want to get near it. Too bad, I thought she would and I could mix her medicine in it."
5,Cat Pleaser,My cat loved milk and always nagged me for some. Unfortunately it gave her the runs. I was so happy I saw this at Petsmart. She loves it and her tummy tolerates it well. She gets about a tablespoon every night before bed and I would hate to forget to give it to her. Would get no sleep that night for sure.
4,Cat sip? Cat gobble!,"New product for our house. So far two out of three are in love (gobble gobble). The third just hasn't decided yet. Heard this is good for urinary tract disorders. Hope so, one of the two gobblers has had a slight problem in that area."
5,Excellent Overview for Recently Diagnosed Diabetics,"Just after turning 50, I had a sudden, unexplained weight loss that turned out to be Type II diabetes.This book is one of the best I've read as an initial overview of the disease and how to cope with it. Its clear and concise, providing adequate--but not too much--information in plain language.If you've recently been diagnosed with diabetes, I strongly recommend this book as a beginning point in your education. Its 10 bucks well spent!"
2,Merkaba album review,I bought this to have a guided meditation of the Merkaba.The album is about 43 minutes long which contains a quad-druplicate of most of the tracks. I contacted Amazon to tellthem to tell the vender of this.The meditation was great but the value of purchasingthe album was not.
1,Better on your own,"It is impossible to meditate with this CD. She talks so fast that I am unable to follow with such speed. I think it meant to listen, memorize and meditate on your own."
2,Not great information here.,"This book is marginal compared to Ross Mueller's ""Upper Midwest Trout Flies: and how to fish them"" These guys don't get more than 100 feet off the raod, so how are they experts on these streams? Considering their age, I can se why they don't pound these streams to where the real trout are."
3,A couple of problems,"Firstly, the top does not lift up very far for cleaning. Cleaning the inside is therefore a hassle.Secondly, the temperature control knob is black as is the unit; you cannot easily see the position of the knob! I marked a few places on the unit with a Sharpie and colored the top of the knob so I could at least tell what was going on."
1,long lasting but becomes a fire hazzard.,"I had this for a few years and it worked great but I was always extremely careful with it, always cutting off its' power source after every use because I didn't trust it. And sure enough, it had fire-sparks from its' old and over-used state today. I switched to a NON-coil hotplate some year in between, figuring it was less of a fire hazzard, but it broke after a year, so I went back to this one."
1,The worst single burner I have ever used,"I bought this unit because of other reviews. However, when I first used it, I noticed that when I had it on low heat, the entire coil would get red hot for about 2 minutes and then cool down to the lower setting. When I had it on high, it would get red hot and then cut off after a few minutes.I called Proctor Silex and they were very, very friendly. They said it was defective and would send a replacement. Well, the replacement does exactly the same thing as the original. I think the placement of the thermostat (up front and below the case) is the problem.I gave both of them to the Good Will. Perhaps someone can use them. I have an older toastmast 6420 that I have used for over 10 years and guess I'll buy another one of those; even though the reviews on Amazon regarding that unit are horrendous. I have never had a problem with mine"
2,a pain,when this eventually stops working you have to take it apart an reconnect the wires on the inside so it will again
1,long lasting but it's a fire hazzard.,"long lasting but it's a fire hazzard.used it for 3 years but the open top design lets in liquids from your pan or pot into the mechanics of it and cause a fire. I threw it away when it almost did that; there were sparks from the coil that went into the main mechanism which has a small opening.I never trusted it so i always made sure it's electrical source was cut off everytime it was not in use and in my sight, and it's a good thing I took that precaution, or it could have lead to a major fire. They should really discontinue these coil style mini-burners altogether."
4,Spark Tester from Amazon,The spark tester performs as advertised. Its small but does the job. The added feature is the adjustable gap to indicate the spark voltage. Worked great on a small engine.
2,predictable story not scary or suspenseful at all!,"Mr. Gates' writing was fine, it was the story that was predictable and unsatisfying. i figured it out extremely early, like in the prologue, and the suspense never really built. i'd be happy to try another of his books, but this one left me flat."
5,Great magazine from the past,"Before I got into Heavy Metal magazine I used to pick up 1984. The combination of Sci-fi fantasy and sex was incredible to me, a teenage boy at the time. Eventually I lost all of the issues I had owned with either friends keeping them or my parents finding them and tossing them in the trash.Now years later I started picking up old issues and I'm still amazed by the detail put into the artwork and the entertaining stories. I'm surprised that 1984 and then 1994 magazines didn't go on and have a longer life like Epic Illustrated or Heavy Metal magazines.If you like sci-fi and fantasy stories and can find issues of 1984 and decide to buy them you will not be dissapointed."
3,Poorly written,This is a fascinating subject as this is one of the most complex African goddesses. There has obviously been lots of research but the author jumps from one subject to another and unintentionally trivializes the subject. We go from buffalo goddesses to spirits of lightning to the goddess of the cloth. Gleason could have done a much better job in writing.
3,Roller coaster ride/ with sudden stop ending,"This book is a roller coaster ride with everyone the main characters ask for help having more problems than them!! The story and events are funny but the ending was to sudden. The reader felt like, thats it? and wanting more. Kind of like a roller coaster ride ending 80% through the ride."
3,Died after 7 years,"Standard toaster worked well on bread, bagels, etc. Nothing fancy, but dependable. Today it just up and died.RIP"
3,This DVD is just an excerpt from Yoga Shakti,"I really hate when companies do this: put out a great product that goes over well with consumers, so then they split it up and repackage it in pieces and then try to sell it to you again. I experienced this with some of Rodney Yee's DVDs a couple of years ago. It's false advertising! (Is George Lucas now running the fitness DVD industry?!) This DVD is merely an excerpt of Shiva Rea's comprehensive Yoga Shakti. So is the Solar Flow Yoga DVD, btw. You're better off just getting Shakti and then you'll have both of those workouts and more besides."
3,over priced,This coffee mug is OK but when you add the cost of the mug in with the cost of shipping it is not worth what is charged.
4,Lots of helpful idea in this one!,I really enjoyed browsing through this book. Lots of their ideas sparked new budget friendly ideas in me. An excellent one to check out for the bride on a budget.
5,10 STARS,Throw all the other books away and just keep this one handy where ever you go!!! This is a must have book for all bride-to-be!! So informative! Everything you need and must know is all in here!!!
2,Gave me nightmares,"Got this book because it was suppose to help me plan my daughter's wedding. The more I read the more depressed I got. The book may have some positives but the negatives outweigh them. The book kept telling me that no matter what I did, I was going to be screwed by wedding planners, vendors, venue representitives etc etc. Sorry but that was my review of it."
5,Must read for newly engaged,"For someone that is newly engaged, this book is a must read because of the amount of information, the detail and all the savings suggestions."
5,"for those who cry ""illegal and immoral""","Hello people...When they suggest ""burn music to cds"" they do not mean to illegally steal music online. They mean to collect your fav. songs, either from yours or your friends cd collection, and burn a mix of those songs.Wake up and stop jumping to conclusions. You are misrepresenting a book you haven't even read properly. :("
2,Dissappointed - would not recommend,"I bought this book because I am planning an out-of-state wedding and financing the wedding on my own. After reading the reviews I expected to find great information on planning a ""wedding on a realistic budget."" But found instead an attitude that in order to have a wedding on a budget it has to be cheap. Thanks, but I will do the research on my own."
3,Bridal Bargains,"The contents are ok, but there's nothing original in Field's advice. Everything in this book can be found in bridal magazines and every other book that deals with planning a weddng on a small budget. Most of it is common sense! Also, the book is oddly shaped making holding the book awkward and tiresome after a short while. The book is long and a slim rectangle and the print is light and small. VERY SMALL! I am a mother helping my daughter plan her wedding, and even with my new RX reading glasses, the print is still hard to read. Fields should consider who is buying her book and tell her publishers to make the print a standard size or slightly bigger print than what is being published now. Overall, a good source of ideas but hard on the eyes. You may need a magnifying glass to read."
1,Majority of information is false and very misleading example on page #290,"This book is loaded with false inaccurate statements. Example on page 290 the book talks about how the size of the camera (2 1/4 vs 35mm)has an effect on warmer colors and richer depth and that 2 1/4 film camera's deliver pictures with more color saturation than 35mm.Let me explain how this is false and misleading information. The size of the camera has nothing to do with these statements. It would be a choice of film. Not camera size. What if the photographer used B/W film in a 2 1/4 camera would you still get more color saturation?Now days wedding photography is done with $8,000.00 35mm digital cameras.This book is out to do one thing put money in the author's pocket no matter how accurate the information is. How sad."
1,Outdated and basically useless,"A friend suggested this book and I'm returning it to the store tomorrow. It's useless. They actually use ""don't buy gloves for your bridesmaids"" as a tip. Really? Gloves? People still do gloves at weddings? Come on. They have no regard for etiquette and are openly hostile towards people who do. They make several incredibly offensive references towards ""anorexic"" girls, and there is some strange misinformation. For example they say that Priscilla of Boston has gone out of business and that the label is now sold by David's, which just isn't true. In addition, the writing is terrible and the overall tone is very much ""they're out to get you"", which is just silly.If you are having a big, traditional wedding in a small town (and over a size 10, apparently), you might get something out of this book. Otherwise, save your money."
1,I second the notion--this book is no BARGAIN.,"If you are getting married, do yourself a favor.. ignore all information in this book unless you want a couple of wed-in-Vegas journalists to plan your most sacred day.I second the notion--this book is no BARGAIN."
2,Bridal Bargains,"My daughter liked the book. But the copy was very used with lots of marking on the inside, cover was dirty and dog-eared and well used."
5,A must-have for every bride,"When I bought this book, I read it cover to cover. I've used many of the tips already, and my wedding isn't until October 1998! I have saved almost $250 right now thanks to Bridal Bargains. It has many real life suggestions that don't sound hoity-toity. After reading many bridal magazines, it is refreshing to see honest advice from people who really know what the bridal industry does to unsuspecting brides. Ditch the magazines, and buy this book. You won't be disappointed."
5,Extremely helpful!,"This is a MUST HAVE for people planning their wedding. Not only does it save you some money, but it saves you some sanity! The best parts of the book are the places where they recommend questions to ask vendors. A photographer we interviewed complemented me on my questions, and asked where I got them from. He said he wished more people would come that prepared. I can honestly say that this book is what prepared me. It was also funny, and entertaining. Enjoy! UBC"
5,"Don't bother with other books on saving money, buy this one.",I checked this book out from the library and ended up buying it because it has such useful information on saving money. I saved two hundred dollars on my dress alone and more money in countless other ways. What a realistic look at weddings and budgets!
5,A wedding planning essential!,"I first bought this book a few years ago in its third edition. I didn't think they could possibly improve on it, but they did. The Brides in Cyberspace web guides and the web/phone index is great. Some of their ideas are a little too frugal for my taste, but as a whole, it's a fabulous book."
5,can i give it 20 stars?!?!,this is my whole grail wedding planner book. i have refered back to it time and time again when looking for things. i even had a photographer ask me how i knew so much about picture taking!!! it was all b/c of this book that i knew what questions to ask. i saved about $400 on my dress b/c i used a website that they recommended. and i also only paid $52 for my tiara and veil online since they steered me away from the $200+ ones at the bridal salons. there are a lot of things that i leanred from this book that have better prepared me now that i am searching for a DJ and baker so that i don't get screwed over. if you are getting married...buy this. i have saved a ton of money and so will you!!!
4,Great place to start,"I am currently using this book to plan my upcoming wedding. I don't know if I am saving a considerable amount of money yet but it sure is helping a lot with the list of questions they have for each vendor. It also provides a great basis for what things should really cost. Although, it differes from city to city, this book is helpful in giving you that extra bit of knowledge and confidence to meet the vendor and ask the right questions. I will probably be sending this book to all my friends who get engaged."
2,Overwhelming information in an unorganized package,"This book is about 4"" thick and has seemingly endless information about weddings, but not enough of the ""quick tips"" I was expecting from the description. It states a lot of obvious facts, for example, if you're trying to cut costs at the reception you should invite less people. I was hoping for more useful information, like how to save money and still have guests at my wedding.I think anyone would be better off with a straight-forward planner likeThe Brides Essential Wedding Planner. I ordered this at the same time as the Bridal Bargains book and found the former much more useful in planning my wedding. The wedding planner has plenty of well written information on the whole event (from announcing your engagement right through the honeymoon) in addition to the money saving tips I was looking for.In summary - skip this book and get a planner."
2,Abandons good sense in favor of wedding excess,"Loved the wedding dress guide so this was a real disappointment. A lot of the advice about how to avoid scams and save money was fine, if you didn't know it from other consumer dealings (eg, pay with your credit card in case a place goes out of business), but too often bargain-hunting took the place of good taste. If you can't afford an open bar, don't serve liquor. But charging your guests for drinks? Would you do that at home? Your reception isn't your magic day where everything must be over the top. Your reception is really just another party, albeit probably bigger and nicer than what you usually do. These people are your guests, not your audience and not your finanicial sponsors.I absolutely agree with San Antonio (below) about the letter from the spoiled princess bride."
2,Discusses big wedding frills for those on a budget,"The authors hold the view that the wedding industry is a racket, but they buy into the consumer's dream and just give you tips on how to play the game and beat the racket, not leave it behind. If you are on a budget and just starting your look at how you want to celebrate the start of your marriage, I recommend _One Perfect Day: The Selling of the American Wedding_ (a little academic, but eye-opening) or _Brides, Inc_. Does your wedding have to be $30,000 extravaganza? No. Does it have to be a bargain-basement version with an over-priced at any price white meringue dress, tasteless multi-tiered cake and tons of tulle ?No. Just remember: it's a ceremony followed by a party with people you love and who love you. If you want the frills but lack the cash, then maybe this book is for you."
4,"Handy info, interesting ideas!","I really feel as if the negative reviews of this book were way too harsh--this was a great guide! Although there were some things that I had already planned on doing or ideas I had already ping-ponged around in my head, overall, this book included a LOT of items that I hadn't thought about! The links were an awesome inclusion (albeit some are out-of-date, but what'd you expect? Things change everyday on the internet!) and the planning spreadsheets at the end were also a really helpful tool. All in all, I would definitely recommend this book to the DIY bride or even to the bride who just wants to save a few dollars."
2,Dissapointing,"Most of the material is basic knowledge I already knew. Such as, you can save money by buying your dress online or asking a friend to make one. The only part I liked was the questions to ask vendors."
5,excellent,"Excellent book, full of great advice and good tips. I'm going to pass mine on and buy more for every bride I know."
4,Here's a reality check for Martha Stewart,"If you've recently picked up a copy of Modern Bride, or a wedding planning guide by the likes of Martha Stewart, you might get the impression that only the Sultan of Brunei can affort to get married. Bridal Bargains is a good reality check for the rest of us. Not only will this book help you save money, it will tell you how to get the most for every dollar you spend on wedding services. The authors uncover many of the rip-offs and outright scams that go on in the wedding industry. Did you know that the average wedding dress, which costs around $1,000, is made to be a disposable garment? That the award-winning photographer probably sends his less-talented assistant out on wedding shoots? If you're planning a wedding, read this book and be a smart bridal consumer"
5,A must-have for any bride!,"I picked up this book out of sheer curiousity at a trip to a local bookstore. It claims that if it can't save you $500 or more on your wedding then you can send it back for a refund of the book, no questions asked. I thought, well, if I don't like it, then I can always send it back.Well, I no longer think that. ""Bridal Bargains"" has helped me out so much with planning my wedding. It tells you tons of tips on how to save, as well as reviewing dress designers, online florists, invitation companies, and much more. In the back of the book is a punch out list of questions for all the vendors to take with you so you won't forget to ask an important question.If you are planning a wedding or know someone who is, this book is a definite must. I won't be sending ""Bridal Bargains"" back; I'm going to pass it on to another bride so she can learn how to save money on her big day too."
5,You Need This Book If You Are Planning Any Size Wedding,"Don't plan a wedding without it! The writers have done all the research for you. It is truly how to have a $20,000 wedding for $10,000 or less depending on how much time you have to shop. I found my dress for 1/2 price at one of the places they mention and it doesn't even need alterations. There are so many cost saving ideas in here you can't afford to plan without this book. I bought several books and this is the only one that I have really used and benefited from."
5,The Only Wedding Planner You Need,"This book is excellent. I would recommend it to anyone who is planning a wedding. It gives realistic advice on everything, especially setting a budget. This book also explains how to avoid wedding scams (unfortunately there are quite a few). Don't plan a wedding without it!"
5,* Worth every penny ! **,"Yes, you do need this book if you are a bride to be. I was a bridal consultant 10 years ago, and I thought I would remember it all, but everything changes! The internet has come a long way and with it the bridal industry changed. This book is worth the money ( if nothing else, you have a money back guarantee, what do you have to lose ? ) for the small tips alone."
2,Purchased as a gift.,I purchased this book as a gift for my niece. She liked the book -- but it isn't a must buy -- there are other books out there.
1,"Can we get REAL, please?","This book is truly tacky! The tone almost sounds like tabloid reporting. Yes, there are scams in the bridal industry, but not everything is a scam! I think the Fields' need to stick to a field they have credentials in...it seems that this book was written by a former bride who is looking to capitalize on making others paranoid. I say PASS ON THIS ONE, DEFINITELY!"
4,Very detailed and Organized,"I just got engaged and this was the first book I purchased. There is a lot of details, and the book is laid out very well. I suggest tabbing pages as you go, since there is going to be sooo much information to review over the next several months. A Very Good Investment for any bride!"
5,A must for every bride to be,"I used an older version of this book that my mom gave me for my wedding in 2003-I had less than 3 months to plan, but the advice in this book was fantastic and served me extremely well! I ended up buying my beautiful wedding gown, (beaded, with a long train and bustle) for $35.00 at Goodwill (which undoubtedly cost over $1000.00 brand new), my sister found her MOH dress at a bargain price as well (leftover prom dress at a HUGE discount at a local department store) and the advice about flowers, cakes and photographers was phenomenal. We spent our money on the things we felt were important (venue, photographer) and we ended up having a brilliant time! Eight years later, we look back and think about what a FUN wedding we had, with zero regrets about $$ spent."
5,Indispensible in my wedding planning!,"When I got engaged, my aunt purchased this book for me, and it was the best planning tool I had for my wedding. In addition to money-saving tips (and I did save well over the promised $500 on my dress alone), it provides a good list of questions to ask vendors prior to making your selection. Some of these were things I would have never thought to ask, but I was glad I did. I already gave my copy to a friend who is getting married and have purchased another copy as a gift for a newly engaged family member. I HIGHLY recommend this book!"
5,Great for sorting though the bridal hype,"This was the first book I bought in the planning of my wedding. I have found it very informative, especially the section on choosing the dress. The tips on how to save money are great, they aren't the generalizations you find in the bridal magazines or in some books. This book details practical ideas, not just grandiose ones that you can't afford. It also tells you where it's pratical to save and where it's not, such as the downfalls of doing your own catering or having a home wedding. This book is a godsend for the modern day bride trying to have a cheap wedding- no wonder the bridal industry hates them."
4,HELPED ME IN A REALISTIC WAY.,I love the way that they put every question you need to ask the different services you will use to get your moneys worth.Things i wouldnt think of. There are so many tips that i will use in this book. And that flower service is much better than growing your own!
4,"If you're looking for great information, go no further","The number one thing that sets this book apart from all the other bridal planning books is the amount of information it provides. While it does tend to be very negative toward the bridal industry and focus on low-budget weddings, there are tips, websites, and phone numbers that can aid ANY bride. Unlike many other low-budget wedding books I've seen, it actually provides web addresses and phone numbers with information that really helps. The authors don't merely provide suggestions; they give real-world advice and real ways to use it.Bottom line: Take their views of the wedding industry with a grain of salt and take advantage of the hours and hours of research that went into this book that will save money."
5,You have to look at this book,"You really must look at this book before or during your wedding planning. It's incredibly informative. Even if you're thinking, ""I'm not really on a budget anyway,"" it has some really great ideas for everything wedding. To help you think outside the box, and most often, to think outside of the really-expensive-because-everyone-is-doing-it box. Really great, and I highly highly recommend it. Also, really well organized.- HOWEVER -Make sure you check your local library. I was worried about getting the 10th edition of the book, so I bought it here, but found it at my library the next day.Or maybe when you're done with it, give it to your local library!"
4,SO helpful!,"This book has been a huge help in planning our wedding! A good chunk of the information I'd already read or hear from other sources - but a lot of the information was also fresh and new and incredibly helpful. Tips and ideas that never really crossed our minds. And, most importantly, knowing how to ask the right questions and traps and pitfalls to avoid in the bridal industry. Not only has it helped us to save money in our overall planning, but it's also helped us to be more aware and cautious. We work hard for our money and, while we do want this to be a special and memorable day, we don't want to be taken for a ride either while somebody else profits off of our happiness and naivete.Definitely recommend this to anyone looking to save money or just wants some advice before jumping into the world of wedding planning."
4,"Easy to use, very helpful","I like this book because it's broken down into sections, so as I plan each part of the wedding I can use it for references. There are a lot of great ideas & websites to go to, and includes some information from ""real brides."" The only thing that I'm not particularly fond of is that they seem to go on and on about why NOT to buy from David's Bridal. I understand an opinion, but really? It's kind of annoying. Minus that one part, I'm really glad I got it. Out of all the 10+ books I checked out from the library and purchased, this is the one I keep coming back to."
5,Yippee! A must have for all brides!,"With 8 months left to go, I wish I would have bought this about 4 months ago. I love the insights into the minds of the those in the wedding business and how all they care about is the bride's money! The dress manufacturer ratings came in quite handy and caused me to change bridesmaids dresses. And I have a few tricks when I go to the florist! Every bride-to-be should have this book!"
5,Great Resource for Clueless Brides looking to cut costs,"I'm the first of anyone I know to get married. While my father would do anything for his little girl, my budget is limited as I don't want to place my already broke father into debt. This book has great cost cutting tips and resources on the web for you to go and look for discounts on dresses (I never knew all the scams boutiques ran!), honeymoons, photography, and more! A must for all brides."
4,"Plain, but informative","There is a LOT of good information in this book. It's well written and I guess for the price you get what you pay for, but I would've liked to see this a bit more expanded with color details.There's lots of good advice for saving money, but some of the websites are dated.Overall I would recommend."
5,A powerhouse of usable information!,"Anyone looking for advice while planning your wedding must read this book. It teaches you what to watch out for with your various vendors and it shows you so many ways to save a bundle. I found myself highlighting so much information. I bought other books but this one far surpasses them! It rates the bridal shops too, saving you lots of grief. I highly recommend it."
5,Do Not Plan A Wedding Without This Book!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This is an excellent book for the bride with a budget. I highly reccomend it.
4,Great Buy!,"Very great resource for finding venues, caterers and dresses. The only thing that I don't think is possible for most people is to throw a wedding with 10k."
2,Useful for city dwellers,This is a good book if you live in larger areas. Rural areas do not apply to most of the book. The best tip however was the detail about David's Bridal and their lack of customer service. Very true!
3,Great collection. Some interesting extras.,"Never seen Vertigo before, it's a meticulously restored version from 1996. A few flaws in other videos, but minor. B+"
5,Love Hitchcock,"I have always loved Hitchcock's material, this package gave me 3 of his movies that I have not seen on the big screen."
5,My favourite book!,"I found this book very good. I cannot begin to explain how great it is, it has answered many things I wondered about, and even created new questions about the phenomenon of Chi (bioenergy.)I've read this book twice, and plan to read it again. If you're tired of how society believes the world is so plain, and you know it can't be so, this could be a great introduction to the world as it truly exists, and the people who harnessed the laws of nature to transcend and have power over the phsyical world.If this book doesn't convince you about the true nature of the universe, which will be hard to disbelieve after reading the book with an open mind, you could still regard it as truly fiction, and still enjoy the book. But, I know for sure this is not fiction!Have a good time reading this excellent book."
4,a raised eyebrow,"i grew up thinking that such things existed .what young asian boy fed on the stuff of huang fei hung legends hasn't dreamed of such things ?! as i got older , i relegated such beliefs to the realm of kungfu hocus pocus . i still think there are more charlatans out there then real masters .i am still skeptical . this book hasn't changed that . it's a good read , but not enough to convince me to make that mental leap of faith .i found the writer's attempt to couch mopai theories in scientific nomenclature ( notes/appendix section ) speculative at best . this is an enterprise doomed to failure at its very outset . to be fair to him , he confides that these are merely his opinions .all the same , you will raise your eyebrows quite a few times during the course of this book . if you are the type who likes to have your eyebrows raised , you will not be too disappointed ."
2,A Book for Kids just hitting Puberty,"I have spent ten years practicing in the esoteric traditions. I was very excited to get this book after watching the John Chang video on youtube. I think John Chang has great potential and a book about him and his adventures would be equally great. Unfortunately, we are limited by the writing style of someone with a real intellect and emotional maturity of a 16 year old. I guess it could be exciting if I was 16. I read many, many hardcore technical books but I find reading this non-technical book very difficult to follow. I think if we had a better interviewer, we could have gotten really good information from John Chang. Unfortunately, the writing style here is my penis is bigger than your penis.I give this 2 stars for the potential it could offer. I just wished the writer had some spiritual development. It's a shame that someone with a emotional maturity of a 16 year old is allowed to write a book on the teachings of a taoist immortal."
2,Values and choices,"There are many of us interested in the human potential movement and ecological wholeness. We read Redfield, Millman, Capra, and others as we try and develope those qualities we value. Some of mine are health, compassion, strength, awareness, and vision.The 'character' in this book can light paper on fire and move objects with his internal energy. He also smokes cigarettes, drives recklessly, and eats animals.This is not the path for me."
1,What the....have we learned nothing from Houdini?,"This book is complete fiction and is insulting to the educated reader who is not willing to believe you can buy the Brooklyn Bridge. Perhaps the author Danaos, (AKA Dervenis), should have studied up on Taoism before writing a book, it would have helped a great deal with the content, the facts and the non-fictionality of it all. For example, most of the ""masters"" mentioned in this book are Buddhist, not Taoist. It seems that one studying so ""deeply"" should know the difference. Most importantly, any magician worth their salt could perform these tricks...where is Harry Houdini when you need him?Don't waste you money on this book. Buy ""Magic the Gathering"" cards if you want to stock up on your Mana. At least they will be worth something when you are tired of looking at them.If you want a book on Taoism, seek it elsewhere.Puhhhlease."
5,One of the best books I've ever read !,"This is a must read for anyone interested in a better understanding of energy. It was written by Kosta Danaos the first western student excepted by John Chang who is a master of Neikung which means ""internal power"". Neikung seems to be the other side of Chikung which had been for the most part forgotten about. Through this system which harnesses the power of both the Yin & the Yang many abilities come to light. Including pyrokinesis, telekinesis, levitation & telepathy. Like I said it's a must read. I can't wait for the next book !"
2,Something's Not Kosher This Hanukkah,"Though the illustrations in this book are aesthetically beautiful it is a shame that the facts, such as the correct way to light the Menorah, are misrepresented. It is also incorrect that a family who would bother to wear yalmulka's, and say blessings and prayers would serve ""brisket, and sour cream"" at the holiday meal. (There is no such tradition --at least not one of Jewish origin.) Even those who do not keep kosher eat applesauce with their potato pancakes. Ms. Bunting's lovely words are wasted here because they lack authenticity."
5,Great Information,I found this book to be extremely informative and would recommend it to anyone considering a special diet.
5,Excellent source for information,"This book fully explains the diets & reasons for them-with recipes too. In the back, author has listed Her web page e-mail address & many other contact resource addresses, phone or fax numbers-web pages- for everything from cookbooks to food companies, organizations, medical info...even alternative treatments organizations. Don't think I-nor anyone- could choose any better book. It's also a quick, easy read.MJJaegr"
5,Excellent starting point!,"Realizing your child has food sensitivities can be overwhelming. There is a steep learning curve. this book has great kid-friendly recipes that adults will enjoy, too. It also offers encouragement, practical how-to's and useful information regarding allergies/sensitivites. I would highly recommend this as your first book to get an idea of how to cook for your child."
5,memory lane,"i listened to many of these songs when i was a yong man. the memories alone were worth the purchase price. if you are an america fan, this is a must have item!"
1,Botched opportunity,Wow this could be the worst job ever in putting together a box set -- left off so many great songs from Holiday and Hearts and included so many awful songs. Its a crime!!!!
3,Mediocre Collection,The boys were good at their peak. They just don't have enough good mateial to fill all of these discs. One less disc would have been better.
4,Encompasses complexity of race in Brazil,"While this movie may not be the ""best"" that Brazilian cinema has to offer, I think that it provides a detailed look into the complexities of race in Brazil, especially its historical origins. Note the difference in how the Brazilian-born diamond govt. employee treats Xica versus the pretentious Portuguese nobleman. This difference symbolizes the very thing that makes race relations in Brazil so hard to explain to foreigners, especially Americans. It also has some kick-tushy music by Jorge Ben; you'll finish the movie humming the continuous theme of the movie ""Xica da.. Xica da.. Xica da Silva""."
1,what brazilians think of afro-brazilian women,"A racist film that uses exotica and the most rabid stereotypes of black sexuality to sell a flawed product. Hopefully a proud, educated Afro-Brazilian will come along some day and tell the true story of Xica."
3,I have seen better,"This is a silly movie! Satirically depicting the sexually manipulative abilities of a historical figure, the movie alternates with every scene from silly to stupid. Although the movie is mildly entertaining, it lacks substance and I would not recommend it to anyone who is interested in experiencing Brazilian Cinema. It is a far cry from The City of God."
3,Good track... but,"As a Celine Dion fan, I was a little bit disappointed that ""I Want You To Need Me"" was underappreciated in the United States, where it lacked significant airplay (it was number one in her native Canada, though). However, I would not have chosen it as the follow-up to the huge smash ""That's The Way It Is."" Celine's been overproduced this time. She screams a lot in this song, and that is a shame, since the lyrics are great, and she worked with Matt Serletic (remember Santana's ""Smooth""?). Well, there is consolation in the fact that there are single-worthy hits in her ""All The Way"" album that can take Celine back to Number 1; for example, the Shania Twain-penned hit ""If Walls Could Talk"" and the great ballad ""Then You Look At Me,"" which can be found in the ""Bicentennial Man"" soundtrack. Let's hope 550 music digs into Celine's album once more and chooses a well-deserved smash in one of the aforementioned tunes."
4,Dexter Freebish Back with brilliance!,"It seems like after 2000's A Life of Saturdays, Dexter Freebish disappeared off the musical map. Well it turns out they weren't just screwin around. Tripped Into Divine is 12 songs that grab you and don't let go. The first single ""Prozak (Be Like Me)"" is pure pop with an edge that will stick in your head for days and just won the John Lennon Songwriters award for best Rock Song (the band's second time winning).""Ghosts"" resembles an old Police track and is pulled off incredibly. Another great track buried on the album is ""Twilight"" which is solid throughout.Overall its sonically and lyrically killer. The album has few weak spots and is one of the best albums of this short year to date. Congrats to Dexter Freebish!"
3,not as good as life of saturdays,"after giving the album a few complete listens, i've come to the conclusion that the reason why this album fails a little is because it doesn't have many standout songs. every song on life of saturdays was completely different and required kyle to singing in a variety of ways. during the middle of this album, he just kind of floats through. by no means is this a bad album. it's just not as good life of saturdays. it reminds me of how matchbox twenty's ""more than you think you are"" was a disappointment - good, but not nearly as good as their previous two albums. standout songs are prozak, ghost (voices in my head), twilight, how do i get through to you?, and breakdown. p.s. - pretty people is kind of annoying. the lyrics just aren't good. i know it's supposed to be satire, but it isn't very good satire."
2,Dexter Loses Their Dexterity,"I've been looking forward to the second album of Dexter Freebish for some time. However, after giving the CD a listen, I feel only marginally satisfied. The new album is missing the unique sound and upbeat vibe that made ""Life of Saturdays"" such a great album. There is definitely no song on the album that even begins to approach the quality of ""Leaving Town"".I think that ""Prozak"" and ""How Do I Get Through To You"" do have merit. ""Prozak"" is an upbeat song about wanting to be one of the ""cool guys"" with a bit of a punk flavor comparable to the Fountains of Wayne song ""Stacie's Mom"". ""How Do I Get Through To You"" is a rock ballad that sounds a bit like something ""Lifehouse"" or ""The Calling"" might produce.I want Dexter Freebish to be around and producing great music for a long time to come, but I'm afraid that this album might not ensure their longevity"
4,df - definitely fantastic,This is an album that you can throw into your CD player and just listen to it over and over again. From start to finish every song is fantastic! A great rock album to add to anyone's collection!!
4,Short & Sweet...,"After the long awaited return from their last album, Life of Saturdays, Dexter Freebish is back with a bang bigger than the last. Their latest album, Tripped Into Divine, offers a sound to meet any mood. Whether it's a ""driving down the highway, windows down"", ""listening to the rain, while hiding under the sheets"" or a ""dancing around in your panties"" sort of day, Tripped Into Divine is the perfect CD to pop in and jam along with."
3,Dexter Freebish Return With A Powerful Sophomore Attempt,"Remember Dexter Freebish? No? Remember the song, ?Leaving Town?? Sure you do. Well, the boys from Austin, TX are back after four years of albumless obscurity. How do they fare? Quite well, actually. From the rocking opening track of ?Prozak? to the final farewell of ?Breakdown?, Dexter Freebish makes it obvious that they?ve grown, musically, in the last four years. While nothing stands out quite like ?Leaving Town?, the band does serve up a more unified, listenable experience. Seemingly influenced by 70?s funk, Collective Soul, and a dash of eastern sound, Tripped Into Divine offers a lot of good for everyone."
1,Not specific to the GMAT at all,"These are just general review cards -- they don't really prepare you for taking the GMAT. They are interesting for keeping up on general pre-calc math and vocab though.I prefer the Princeton Review products, though they don't have flashcards.Cracking the GMAT with DVD, 2008 Edition (Graduate Test Prep)"
2,Very little real GMAT material,"when comparing GMAT books and the study cards, they don't really have much in common. First I sorted them out, and basically threw away a third of the cards, since they were not really GMAT related, especially once you know what exactly is tested on the real GMAT exam. Wanna study GMAT - make your own study cards!"
2,Almost...but not quite,"While this book addresses all of the cognitive processes needed to take the test, as well as the types of questions the Praxis test MAY have, I found the typographical errors and editing oversights to be distracting. Particularly frustrating examples of this occurred in answer key to the sample test. As I was reviewing, I found that the explanations of some correct answers did not correspond with the letter given as correct. It made me question how many of the others that I did NOT scrutinize, had the same problem. While the book provides insight into the construction of the Praxis test itself, which was helpful, in the end, I did not feel that it boosted my confidence in my preparedness in any way."
2,Just Okay,"This book had some good aspects about it (practice questions, info about taking the test). However I don't feel like it prepared me at all to take the test, so quite frankly it wasn't worth the money. Your best bet is to review a little bit of everything you learned in grad school & if your program prepared you enough you'll pass. Good luck"
5,Looked until I found it.,Precious treasure. Just the size and translation I had and needed a replacement. Very difficult to find real leather in a readable translation.
4,Cheeseolicious!!,Great soup. You can really taste the parmesan. The texture is semi creamy. Just the right amount of shell pasta and chicken. As close to a home made soup as you will get in a can.
5,damaged CD,Received a damaged CD and they gave me a full refund. Replied to my emmail quickly and I am happy with the customer service.
4,Answer to prayer,"Its not easy to find a beefy prayer resource. This is one of the best. It just brimming with good, convicting, challenging thoughts, phrases, and ideas.Though the author is CRC, I found the theology and mood of the material are sometimes lacking enough theological complexity and depth in favor of pietistic catchphrases. In general it does, however, have some understanding of the communal aspects of teh faith, a high view of the Church, etc.A very good purchase."
5,One of The BEST!,"This is much more than most of the books on prayer I've run into. It is about a man's travels to many churches to see what they are doing in prayer, and what works well and perhaps not. It is multifaceted, providing examples of remarkable prayer successes and many formats for prayer development in a church. It is particularly aimed at corporate or interpersonal prayers. It is absolutely first rate.Rick Beierwaltes"
5,Fantastic Briefcase,"I bought this for my husband as a gift and we are both very pleased. It is just beautiful...well made and high end. I was concerned that it might look cheap, but not at all! Good size too. Would highly recommend it."
4,this is a perfect-sized brief case/well made,this is a perfect-sized brief case and well-made. the leather is smooth and beautifully dyed. I really like how slender it stays even with all my things in it!
1,"Woof, the smell is really awful",This is very stylish with soft leather. It would be 5 stars except the smell from the dye in the leather is absolutely unbearable. I have to keep it in the garage and janitor closet at work because the smell quickly fills up the room. I don't think its going to disappear any time soon either because it is so strong.
1,waste of money,"beautiful briefcase, only problem is that the handles are so poorly constructed that they pull out from their base, rendering the briefcase useless. Never overstuffed the briefcase and had it for only three months before the handles' support just tore through the leather (?)."
5,great bag,I purchased this bag for my son for his graduation from college. It was the perfect size and he was able to fit his company laptop in as well. He loved the retractable handles as he prefers to use the shoulder strap. He and I were equally pleased!!
4,Plain and simple.....,"Not much style with this briefcase, but it seems well-made and sturdy and high quality leather. Understated, not flashy and looks classy. I would have preferred another color, such as camel or British Tan, but black was the only option. It seems to be a good, serviceable briefcase that is durable and looks very professional."
4,This was given as a gift to my son-in-law.,It was just what he wanted and he was very pleased with it. He needed a more compact briefcase than a current heavy one he was carrying and this fit the bill.
5,Yocona Puff Adder,"An entertaining, exciting and richly autobiographical debut novel, Yocona Puff Adder's 51 chapters could work alone as excellent short stories, but a continuity carries over to tell the ""whole"" story as two boys grow up and old. Best friends and of different races, they form a lasting bond through their experiences that transcends the racial boundaries and bigotry of the era and the place, which is obviously Faulkner's Yoknapatawpha. This superb book shows how the place and some of the people changed (and some haven't)through now."
4,excellent SINGLE frame,"I loved this frame. However, I was a little suprised when it arrived as a SINGLE frame that holds a bunch of pictures... It is hard to tell that from the pic (I expected 6 individual frames)... We altered our gift plans and this still worked beautifully"
3,Quality can be improved,On of the frame panes was broken when I received it. I sent for another piece. That was not a problem actually. Amazing response by Amazon..Impressed.But the frame itself was of some lackluster metal and it felt kinda sticky when I ran my hand over it...Also there was considerable quality difference between the first and the second framesIt certainly could do with some better quality metal. Another thing would be to have some provision to hang it on a wall.I would recommend going to an actual shop and buying such style of frames so that you know what you are getting..
4,"Very pretty, some glass cracked","It wasn't packed very great. Some of the glass on the edges of a few of the individual frames arrived a little cracked, and was loose in the box, so if you order, be careful not to just thrust your hands into a box out of excitement. All the glass came out into the box. None of it can be seen once the glass is back in the frame though. The silver frame covers each broken corner or edge. The frames are a little tight, and a little awkward to get the picture into, but it's very pretty. I'm very pleased with Umbra's frame lines they're selling on Amazon."
4,Nice picture frames,Very nice picture frames. Only thing you should concern is that this one runs really small and barely fit 4x6 picture size. I bought one frame but maybe should have got two more to fill up my hall way.
2,There are better ones for better prices...,"This drill is very well designed, but the ""Variable Speed"" feature just doesn't work. I bit the bullet and purchased this drill after searching for a reversable air drill that was variable speed. After hooking it up and pulling the trigger, I wondered why I'd spent all that money. The speed can be varied, but to a very small extent (unlike electric). It takes both hands to very easily let the throttle out and take advantage of lower RPMs (several hundred RPMs). Another issue with this drill is the noise. I've used air tools for a while, but I've never hear a screetch like this one. I would absolutely recommend hearing protection when operating this!I'll stick with electric and cordless until I can find one that does what it promises."
3,Ultimately disappointing,"I loved the first third of this book. The language is clever and the humor made me laugh out loud. By the end, however, I felt embarrassed for Hilary. She scoffs at those who think that following ""The Rules"" is the best way to find real love, something she seems desperate to find. But where do her methods lead her? She sleeps with men who don't love her, engages in cybersex three hours after discovering chat rooms and admits in every letter that she is unfulfilled and unhappy. The contrast between Kate's letters and hers is vivid, and maybe that was the intent. Kate's suffering was honorable because it involved struggling against real evil. Hilary's wounds were self-inflicted. I finished the book with admiration for Kate and pity for Hilary. True love involves a genuine self-donation, totally giving of oneself for the good of another, but Hilary is so self-absorbed, I fear she is doomed to wallow in her own misery."
3,Not as absorbing as I had expected,"I was a bit disappointed in this book. I love corresponding with others, and I looked forward to learning about Hilary and Kate by reading their letters. I felt that something was missing and I cannot quite put my finger on it.The book was short and I think what I had been looking for was a longer narrative. Kate and Hilary's friendship certainly is one of a kind, and it was nice to have a look at their confidences and challenges.Overall, I vote this book 3.5 stars of 5, as the glimpses of Kenya were poignant and interesting, and I did find Kate and Hilary's relationship intriguing. The story was of real life, so perhaps the only thing wrong was that I have read too much fiction in the past, and this story was reflective of how the world really works."
4,A window- letters and humanity,"This book is a page turner! I believe that writing is the window to one's soul; therefore, through their letters, Kate and Hillary bear just this. In the age of ""instant message"" and ""Email,"" their letters prove that the ""written"" word still has a place in our lives. These women poignantly captured a crucial year in their lives through their words. I laughed with Hillary (as she reminded me of my best friend) bumbling through thirty-something, singles life. I cringed at Kate's experiences, my being a teacher, as I was truly moved by the inhumane treatment of the students and teachers in the African schools; now, her experiences have me thinking if evil is inherent in humankind. I was saddened by the ending; after such an endearing journey through their lives for one year, the reader is left wondering if the authors' lives changed from this ""special"" experience."
4,A great weekend escape!,"I read this is one night. Great contrasts between Hilary's making it in the city and Kate's exploration of a new world - Africa. Anyone who loves travel narrative and still remembers (or is experiencing) what it's like to set out into adult life in search of love and meaning will appreciate this book. While not taxing reading, it is well-written and enjoyable. The personalities of the two girls come through and you end up wishing you could be their friend too!"
3,Where are my old letters?,"""Dear Exile"" sells itself as a book of letters between two friends separated by more than distance. The reader follows two completely different life paths. I found Kate's story to be fascinating, to see how one copes in a third world country and how the views of its citizens are so alien to our own (in America.) Hilary's story was less absorbing. Frankly, it was like listening to a women who is full of herself. She makes it seem that she is the only one who has had to suffer through the ordeal of dating. Please, give me a break. Hilary's ""trials and tribulations"" of living in NYC certainly aren't anything that millions of other people haven't gone through. Nothing special in her story, but without her letters, as page filler, there wouldn't have been enough to publish a book. I wish Kate would have written more about her experiences."
1,Smug,"I looked for the friendship purported in this book. Instead of letters to eachother, these were clearly letters to posterity. What a lonely world if this can pass as intimacy."
1,No Africa here!,"This is not about two friends, this book is about one self-absorbed New Yorker and the grander woman she corresponds with on an African peace corp mission. Kate's story is amazing but not expressed enough so that you are frustrated wanting to know more. Hilary's story is the total opposite with a life that is about material possessions and her sex life. I was thoroughly disappointed as anyone would be who has had a best friend go on a grand adventure."
3,"""A Letter is a joy of Earth--It is denied the Gods""","Less than friendship, these letters reveal the joys of language--formulating, fumbling--that we create for someone we love but are ultimately, unsure of.I like these two for what they chose to reveal about themselves: both Liftin's & Montgomery's language reveal, then pull back, wittily, from their emotions. Friendship, both seem to be saying implicitly, is loving within the critical distance each one sets up for the other.I like this."
4,Good -- but no longer organic,"I first bought these at Babies 'R' Us, and the bag was marked USDA Organic. I was thrilled to find that my daughter and I both loved them, that they were healthy, and low-calorie/low-fat. A perfect combo! So I ordered them on Amazon in bulk.Unfortunately, as of today, Amazon still has the wrong ingredients list. What arrived was the new formulation of this product, which is no longer organic. The company now uses the label ""all natural"" instead, and most of the ingredients are not organic.Excellent customer service on Snikkidy's end; they were forthcoming about the issue and apologized that Amazon hasn't updated the information yet, even though I understand they have no control over that.I will probably continue buying these snacks despite that they're no longer organic. They're very tasty and better for you than most of what's on the market, at least!"
5,Super yummy snacks,Watch out because these snacks are addictive. Very light with a mild cheesy flavor. Bought them for my 2 yr old but can't keep dad out of them. Like the fact that they are not loaded with artificial ingredients and not high in sodium.
3,"Not what I expected, but ok","Picked these up on a whim because I love healthy snacks. I wish they were organic, though. The texture is not what I expected - I was expecting the dense, smooth texture of the more common corn puffs. These are crunchier, and the flavor is very mild. I imagine they would be great for kids, but I won't be picking them up again for the high price."
1,too messy on your hands. Tastes like plastic,Product is too messy and turns your hands orange. It sort of tastes like plastic. Sorry to disagree with other reviewers.
1,You sent me the wrong product!!!!!,"I am so VERY angry and disappointed! You sent me GRILLED CHEESE PUFFS, instead of the mac and cheese corn puffs that I ordered! I can not eat these grilled cheese puffs that you sent me instead of what I ordered, -even if I wanted to- because I am allergic to these ingredients! Why have you sent me the wrong product, and then left me no way to contact you or to return the product back to you so I could have the correct ones sent out to me? The only other feedback I was allowed to send - besides this one - was on the packaging! These mac and cheese puffs are the best snack product ever to have graced our family's home. That is why I order them every month from you through Amazon. But if this is what I am faced with, (no recourse to the wrongly shipped item,) then I will have to go back to ordering the correct product from iherb. At least THEY know how to treat their customers!"
1,I wish they tasted like Grilled Cheese,"I've been looking for a natural cheese puff that did not have all the additives and preservatives in it to make one's stomach upset.I thought I found the right product with ""Snikiddy Snacks Grilled Cheese Puff"".Unfortunately, I was wrong.When you eat one, they do taste good. However after eating a few in a row, there is a bad after taste that can upset your stomach.They are also not very cheesy and the product does not resemble the taste of a grilled cheese in any way, shape or form.I'm still looking for the perfect cheese puff, but these will not be on my list."
1,Prints Great ... When It Works,"I've spent numerous hours messing with this printer. I do TCP/IP networking all of the time but getting this printer to work on the network required calling NEC technical support because the information was poorly presented and vague. When you first call, their first line of support are junior techs who don't know about networking. Then they put me into their queue to have a senior tech call. TWO WEEKS later (and making several more calls to tech support) someone finally got back to me. Fortunately he was very helpful and my issue was finally resolved. HOWEVER, this printer misfeeds all of the time and requires constant attention making it extremely difficult and time consuming to actually get any real work done with it."
2,don't bother,"This waffle iron works, but not well. The steam generated during cooking gets trapped in the casing, condensing inside the machine and causing a steaming of the waffles, rather than a proper baking. And I wonder if that will shorten its lifespan. Also, the heating elements are not powerful enough to provide the proper ""lift"" to the batter during cooking. It may be [inexpensive], but you'll be happier with a better unit."
4,Works well but needs a good size compresser.,"The sander works well but if you are going to use it full time it will require a large compressoer to keep up, my 5hp Ingersol just barely does."
3,Specifications,"Why on earth is there an air tool without any mention of the compressed air requirements? I saw several reviews with somewhat obscure warnings to ""make sure your compressor will handle it"". I don't know what its pressure and volume requirements are, so I have to search its website. Of course I can and will do that, but such a fundamental spec should be there. (Dimensions, Weight, power requirements/air requirements)"
5,It's great!!,"In the words of Tony the Tiger, ""it's great!""As the saying goes, you get what you pay for. I could have purchased a cheaper unit from one of those local freight stores, but they dont carry the world leader in air tools. Do yourself a favor and buy an IR."
3,no operations manual,"I received two small booklets with my sander, Two pages in English, the rest in some foreign lingo, telling the safety hazards, but not a damned thing about how to remove the peel and stick sandpaper. It also has a knob on the side that says zero and max, but not what the heck it's for either. I thought that ""duel action"" was two different options to sand, but nothing in their so called operations manual says anything about changing sanding options. It's also a air hog. I run a Craftsman 3hp 2 stage compressor with a 30 gallon tank, and uses all it can put out. I found that the only way to change the sand paper, was to warm the sanding disc with my heat gun, and then it will come right off. I had to do a internet search to find that information. If it would have included some specific operation instructions on how to use this sander, I would have given it 5 stars, because it does sand good."
1,They should have a 0 for the rating too!,"My kids can see better through a toilet paper roll than this ""telescope.""Meaning, you can't see a freaking thing through it. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY."
1,Review on telescope,"Return back to amazon,and ask for refund. Even though this was for my kid and it is a child's telescope,we could not see anything from it . Not even moon nor stars, all black when you look through peep hole, and does not have a way to adjust it anywhere. Dont buy waist of money and frustrated time consuming moments between you and child,toy not worth it."
2,Paperback version is bad,Interesting book but it was written almost a century ago and the writing style is far from contemporary. It gets a little too descriptive at times. The publisher (CreateSpace) has made a mess of the paperback version; the font size is too small and difficult to read.
4,A Fair Portrayal.,"I myself am a meditator and I have to say, this is a great book. Paul Mason gets beyond hero worship and shows that even the enlightened are human. Maharishi never comes across as a monster and never comes across as a fool. However, I feel Mason's rendition of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi was an essential viewing of the sage's aspirations, be they sometimes strange. Upon finishing this book I felt I had a little more insight into someone who previously seemed unbelievably flawless, and now felt like a human being one could relate to and come off with their own opinion."
2,A little disappointing,"In an effort to be *objective,* Mason's account bends to thenegative side. The author's voice was a little too impersonal andleft me without much insight into who Maharishi actually is.However, the book includes some interesting quotes from hardto find sources. If this isn't what you're looking for you maywant to read ""Beyond Gurus"" instead."
5,I love these videos!!,we used these during our homeschooling years. I can't begin to tell you how wonderful they are. Sharon Solow comes from a family of deaf parents and it shows how dedicated and loving she is towards sign language. I entered asl classes and really had a handle on it! I got the privlege to meet Sharon at a workshop and she is so sweet just like on the video!
1,Why did i ever buy this?,I will never buy another sunbeam! Rachel beat the motor down in under 4 days! No power! Rachel was making PUMPKIN PIE when it died! Now that is PATHETIC! I heard the motor going low but NOT low enough to die! I will never buy another sunbeam!
1,Was ok until it broke after TWO WEEKS!!,"I got this mixer two weeks ago, today is February 25, I received it February 13th. IT was brand new, still in original packaging. It broke on me today part way through a batch of cookies. It just quit. It wasn't hot, I didn't overheat it, or over work it, it just shut itself off like it had enough and hasn't started up again since. I am contacting Sunbeam to see if they will do something about it, but since it was bought a few years ago and just not used until recently, and I wasn't the original buyer, it was sent to me as a gift, I highly doubt they will. Absolute CRAP!!"
1,Should be zero Stars,"This mixer blew on me in less than two weeks. It was the 4th time using, it quit on me. Wasn't laboring, or having trouble, I had just started a batch of cookies and it just shut itself off and never turned back on. Worse yet, Sunbeam refused to do anything about it. It had been bought two years prior but never taken out of the box or wrapping. Totally useless, I will never buy anything Sunbeam again."
4,weird & wonderful,"Hmmm. What to make of page 21 which describes an univited human visitor to the authors butterfly garden stripping naked and plunging into her bluebells (is that what they're calling it now?)?This is obviously not your run-of-the-mill butterfly gardening book to say the least. The essays are beguiling, the photographs are excellent and every now and then you read something like page 21 and go WHAT???"
2,Not worth it,"Have had issues from the start. Only a 4x, very picky about using DVD-, prefers DVD+. Now after 2 years it has quit reading discs at all. Maybe I got a bad one, but go with better brand and you will be better served."
1,aweful,"Buyer beware must be Pacific Digital's mantra. The USB 2.0 dvd burner I bought from them died in under six months. The burner, a lite-on, was fine it was their enclosure that failed. Their customer service was horrendous as was the shipping that I was forced to pay to receive replacement parts, which still have not arrived. If you are looking for a product that will give you reliable service and lasting performance STAY AWAY from pacific digital!!!!"
5,A-MAY-ZING,Quite simply the finest book ever written. The translation is breathtakingly eloquent. I have read each night over and over again.
3,Photo Album,"I really like this photo album but on the website the album was shown in black. There was no option to choose a color so I assumed that I would receive a black album. But the album that I received was white. It's very pretty, but it was a gift for my husband to keep his motorcycle photos in and a white album just doesn't cut it. So even though I like the album I was disappointed with my order."
5,Joan's Way is the Best Way!,"""Joan's Way"" by Joan Collins is an informative read on proper nutrition (that does allow one to indulge!) fantastic exercise routines (that work, trust me) skin, hair and nail care solutions (all practical, effective and quite low cost) vitamin supplementation (all medically sound) and assorted lifestyle tips, including travel and the quest for happiness.Always practical and with a flair for living the good life Collins is chatty and warm rather than stern and commanding in her writing.Accompanied with exclusive photographs by Brian Aris this book is essential for everyone who wants to live life to the fullest and enjoy themselves while looking and feeling fabulous at the same time!"
4,Fun and Interesting,"Ms. Collins gives basic, common sense. Sometimes we just don't think about those things. She is very encouraging when you're having a bad day. Pick it up and see that life isn't all peaches and cream because you're famous."
3,"Entertaining, but not engaging...","I wanted to love this documentary. But, I just felt that it was poorly edited. Nothing seemed to really flow, and properly unfold. The only two characters who had definite storylines were Elmo and Catwoman. But, Catwoman's was only bought together after seeing the additional footage."
1,Junk,"First off the ""low"" setting is way too fast. Next the beaters rusted after I washed them. The motor is extremely cheap and burned out after about 1 hour of use. No bargain here."
2,Toastmaster 1778 Hand Mixer,"This mixer is very powerful, in fact for many purposes it is too powerful. It is fine for whipping potatoes or cream but if you want to fold dry ingredients into dry batter it beats way too fast, such as when mixing pancake batter.TOASTMASTER 1778 HAND MIXER 6SPEED 125W CHROME BEATERS APPLIANCES KITCHEN"
2,There is a reason this is a 2-STAR product,"It simply stops working. If not the first time you use it, the 3rd or 4th for sure. Don't buy this. Wouldn't recommend it at all."
2,Lots of buttons only ONE speed--- fast!,awful mixer. Has many numbered settings but from lowest to highest it's ALL the same speed. Really disappointed.
1,chrome plate falls off from beater while cooking,"After using it several times to beat whip cream, chrome plate of the beater started to fall off. Regarding the price, I would not complain, but I also would not recommend to anyone expect for those who love to have chrome particles sprinkled all over their cake."
1,chrome plate of beater falls off,"After using it several times to beat whip cream, chrome plate of the beater started to fall off. Regarding the price, I would not complain, but I also would not recommend to anyone expect for those who love to have chrome particles sprinkled all over their cake."
3,OK for the money,"The seller above was right, you get what you pay for.Although this item does exactly what it says I should have invested more money into a better quality machine.This machine does have different settings on it BUT the slowest speed mimics the highest speed with a slight difference. While trying to mix just a small batch of muffin mix the mix flies all over simply because there is no slow speed as indicated. You either mix at high speed or what appears to be high with an attitude. Nothing in between.If you are looking for something to use where you can mix at different speeds, I would not recommend this machine. If you want something that will mix at a slow speed because there appears to be no speed slower than high, than find another machine."
2,IR 212 3/8 Impact,"Having used IR air tools for many years and having gotten very good service out of them, when it was time to replace my old IR 3/8 drive impact I of course bought another IR. Sorry to say that I should have looked at the CP's. My 25 year old IR 3/8 gun has almost as much power as this one and the quality of the tool is just not there like it once was. Also was very disappointed but not surprised to see that it is made in China. Would have gladly paid more for the old time IR quality and power. Think I'll see if I can find a rebuild kit for my old IR. By the way I repair heavy equipment and trucks so I use all of my air tools a lot every day every day, everything from 1/4"" drive air ratchet to my 1' drive impact all older IR's."
1,Not impressed,I bought this impact just about a year ago and it just died on me. Automotive repair is my profession and I use this impact about half as much as my 1/2 inch impact. With that I was expecting a lot longer service out of it.
3,Not my favorite Paul Kelly album,"As a big Paul Kelly fan, I found this album worth a listen, but it's not my favorite. Stumbling Block, the first track, is in my opinion the stand-out track. Beyond that, it is nice to hear old songs done in a different style, but the originals far outshine these versions. So my advice, buy the rest of his catalog and hear better versions and so much more buy an artist who deserves far better recognition in the USA."
5,Outstanding Book for the Real World!,This is the best book I have seen for using Excel in the real world! The examples have really helped solve the challeging problem I face daily in my job. The book contains several chapters on all the functions in Excel which has helped me get through several projects faster. The author's charting methods will really help grab the attention of anyone that sees them; this will help you get to the point. Great book!
3,Decent Product,"This product is fair in comparrison to other products of the same nature. The product does not have a decent ammount of battery time. When I first put the batteries in, they were new batteries, and they lasted about 7 minutes total. I was dissapointed in this because I need this product for hours at a time. However the product was delivered rather promptly, and the condition is like new. The only real complaint that I had was on the short battery life."
4,More Essentials of NT Greek,"I appreciate the book, Essentials of New Testament Greek. It provides additional information and insight into the Greek language of the NT writers of the Bible. I also must purchase a replacement NT grammar book, ""Teach Yourself New Testament Greek,"" to continue guiding me in learning this fascinating language of early Christians. I hope to get a hardback copy. My paperback copy was very delicate, and is now gone. I have a Greek-English NT Bible, and also a Greek-English lexicon, which are wonderful.Some day I hope to take a Seminary course in New Testament Greek. Essentials of New Testament Greek is helping my understand the language a good bit more.Laura J. Gray Mitchell"
2,"Good book, poor binding",We used this book in our collage Greek class for one year. By the midpoint a majority of the books were falling apart. My lower rating is based on the quality of the binding. The instructor's book was also falling apart and his was about 10 years older so it seems to be an ongoing issue with the publisher. It is a good book for learning Greek but as another reviewer stated Mounce's book is better and the book by George A. Hadjiantoniou is a good one as well. If you want a book to sit on the shelf then this is fine. If you plan to actually read and study from it you may end up with a majority of the pages falling out. I also have a red cover early edition and the binging is good and tight so it seems to be the brown cover book that is the problem which is the one the class used.
3,Greek from a Latin Point of View,"There are two social traditions in presenting Greek, the Biblical and the classical. Summers presents the Biblical, a somehwat simplified view, adequate perhaps if you are not really going to read the Bible in Greek. Stepping in where classicists fear to tread, he applies Latin terminology to the Greek language. We learn that Greek has an ablative and an instrumental. He means, of course, that those cases have merged with the genitive and dative in Greek. Caveat imperitus."
1,Poor Greek Scholar,I cannot believe some of the Greek definitions he has come up with. I truely believe Ray Summers has a distain for the word of God. Has he ever given a true testimony?
1,Very poor quality kindle edition,"I just got this for an independent studies class. It's scanned so you cannot increase the size of the font, and it is hard to read. Do not buy the kindle version I am going to see if I can get a refund. This shouldn't even be out there as a kindle version, especially for $16."
3,Good Quality Material: Poor Quality of Kindle Version,"The Greek grammar is excellent, but the Kindle download is poor quality. The text is small and zooming in makes the text too blurry to read well."
4,"Good explanation, poor exercises.","This is a good introduction to studying Koine Greek, though it should probably be supplemented. The workbook is nearly essential (contrary to other reviews, it's quite easy to find), especially since it's true, there are no answers to the included exercises in the textbook itself.But the explanations are clear and easy to follow. The text is well-written and concise. The font is quite readable and clear, and you shouldn't have any problems reading the Greek text itself.If you get this book, do yourself a favor and get the workbook too. Together they make a nice pair."
5,Good basic text of New Testament Greek.,"Good basic Text of New Testament Greek. Has all the basics. Not as detailed as the classic Dana and Mantey which is more detailed in grammar, or the massive A. T. Robertson. This text is ideal for a summary short course to point people to reading the Greek New Testament. I am combining with study of vocabulary in Metzger."
5,One of the better introductions to Biblical [Koine] Greek,"Ray Summer's ""Essentials of New Testament Greek"" revised by Thomas Sawyer, is one of the better primers of Koine (Biblical) Greek.Here is why:(1) It introduces the Greek Alphabet in large type illustrations.(2) It employs large type illustrations to offer instruction in writing the Greek Alaphbet in the first several pages of the book.(3) There is a large FOLD-OUT chart of Verb Conjugations, glued inside the back cover. It folds out rather like a road map.(4) The book follows a clear outline, and seems better acqainted with the difficulties that a beginner has in learning a foreign language. In other words, I've learned that many people may know a subject, but that does not necessarily mean they can teach it well. This book is based upon a good teacher's approach. The lessons are neither too long, nor too complicated. It is well broken down into simple segments./"
2,Obscure Does Not Equal Good Quality,"So some people are aware of obscure ""prog rock"" bands from the 70's and they spin that into some kind of self-made club for alleged aficionados of prog rock. What else is new? People often make it sound like they have the inside track.This band sounds stuck in the late 60's. The music is pretentious. The drummer is simplistic and there is waaaaay toooo much organ. If you like droning organs and drums breaking out while the vocalist tries to sound important then this is for you. This crew doesn't hold a candle to Yes, King Crimson, or the Mahavishnu Orchestra. It is not even close."
4,Recipes you'll use!,"I like recipe books with lots of pictures to see what the meal will look like. This book loses a star for only having some recipes shown (300 recipes, 75 photos with multiple recipes shown in them).More important to me is functionality of recipes. Will I be able to make them? Do they sound appetizing? Will it take me an entire day to cook?This book goes above and beyond. Nearly every recipe in the book sounds like something I want to cook. Each recipe is marked for being either under 5 ingredients, being a single pot dish or cookable in under 30 minutes. These recipes are simple, tasty and creative.If you want every page to have a picture on it, this isn't for you. If you want a collection of great day to day recipes, pick this up."
1,It broke after a few use!!,"I got this item at Christmas at my old company during a gift exchange. It was brand new and I just pulled it out to use. After a four mornings of juicing, the engine just went out. I called about the warranty and they wanted me to show proof of purchase. The warranty is 1 year after PURCHASE. I guess Toastmaster don't really stand by their products. Not worth the money, even if it's under $10. This product is not supposed to be a disposable product -- but now I have to throw away after a few use."
2,Weak motor,"The juicer appears to have a weak motor. Putting even small pressure on th squizzed orange procudes loud, nasty voice and the motor stops. It occurs in both directions but more in counter clockwise direction. I have to squizz the oranges very gingerly and it takes a long time. Best feature - it's very easy to clean"
1,same part broke in 3 different machines RIP OFF,"I have 3 of these now and none work because the same part ""small cone p/n 70718 "" has cracked where the shaft goes in . Customer service is none-existent .. They have email addresses that don't work , telephone numbers that tell you 50 people are in line ahead of you , and no satisfaction . Don't waste your money . They must know that the part is no good and being looking for rebuys . not anymore !!!!!"
5,THE ULTIMATE RUSH HAS SOMETHING FOR EVERYONE!!!,"Whether you are or know of a white-collar stockbroker, a punked-out rollerblader/skateboarder, or a hacker, or just want to experience their worlds vicariously - you'll love this book. While taking you for the ride of your life, It lets you experience a cross-section of society that questions who's actions are right, and who's view of the world is real. You find yourself looking at people unlike yourself for something deeper - what makes them tick, what is the motive of their hearts, what can the future hold for them? The plot is great fun, the action is awesome, and the dialog is clever and very funny. Get your ticket punched and join up for the ultimate ride called THE ULTIMATE RUSH!"
3,An Enjoyable Ride,"The Chinese Mob, The Itailian Mob, corrupt police, Skate Punks, Stock fraud, does is seem too much? Maybe, but Joe Quirk spins a wonderfully written tale with great pace about a rollerblanding messenger caught in the wrong place at the wrong time. Lots of action and great wit keeps this story moving along quickly to the action packed climax."
5,"An unforgettable, witty ride!","Joe Quirk's first book is funny, witty, intelligent, and exciting. The Ultimate Rush is a tragi-comic satire that you can't put down. A fun read from an extremely promising novelist."
3,Good Summer Time Fluff,"No, this isn't profound. Or Deep. Or well-written. The plot is predictable and implausable. The slang is dated. BUT - what a great ""by the pool"" summer read. Fast-paced escapism is perfect for heat-slowed brains. The novel will never win any prestigious awards, but it sure is fun."
3,"Painfully cliche, but breathtakingly exciting","I must admit when I first opened this book, I scoffed at the ridiculously stereotypical and inaccurate portrayal of bike messengers. Not to mention the painfully overdone ""California-speak""dialogue that looks like it was written by a grandpa trying too hard to be hip to the younger generation. I mean, honestly, nobody really talks like the characters in this book (I hope!). But as much as I laughed and shook my head while I was reading this, I found myself pulled in by the thrilling action and the romantic sub-plot. I fell in love with Ho, too! There are so many twists and turns that had me literally breathless at times. And it's pretty damn funny, too. Not a 'great' book in terms of literary critique, but fascinating and very fun."
3,"Fun read, hilarious in spots but could have been better.","Overall I liked this book but it could have been lots better. It's different and the central character is pretty unique. It's also incredibly funny in spots. That said, there's a few glaring difficiencies. The worst is the overworked finale showdown between police, chinese gunmen, Italian mobsters, skateboarders (all present in groups) and of course covered by the press. Give me a break --- YAWN!!! This orgasm of text is best skipped by the reader. Other than that the book is OK."
4,An entertaining book with a fast paced delivery.,Joe Quirk did a great job in writing this thrilling adventure in today's youthfull environment. Will pass it on to friends for them to read. Should not offend anyone. Early high school or above. Waitng to see what else this author can deliver.
2,"Fantasy of hacking - Juvenile Reading - Amusing, tough","This book's a total fantasy about the underground World. The writer doesn't have a clue of what hacking or phreaking really is. Stereotypes. If you want to have some fun, this book is worth, and nothing else: Lot's of slangs, fast paced and predictive. Don't take all those 5-star ratings."
2,"Nothing special, folks.","Pretty slight. The writing is basically amateurish, the plot totally predictable if you've ever seen a movie. Cartoon Chinese villains -- yuck."
5,"An oldie, but a goodie","This movie is hilarious.Even though this movie is not new, or anywhere close to being considered a new release, it is very entertaining to say the least, and a must have.Without giving away any major plot descriptions, this movie is about an executive that lives a very comfortable ""high on the hog"" lifestyle. Unfortunately, he loses his job unexpectedly that places him, and his wife in a worrisome situation of ""What will we do now?""Buy the movie, kick back, and enjoy a very funny movie, in a different time that reflects a mood that is financially close to today's time period."
4,We don't need no stinkin' remake,"This is one of my all-time favorite comedies. Segal and Fonda are a perfect onscreen couple. They're both hysterically funny without trying too hard. Ed McMahon will never escape Johnny Carson, but he's a pretty darn good actor, too. A lot of people remember the kindly old pharmacist and the randy teenager from ""Amazon Women on the Moon"", but does anyone remember that it was a spoof based on this movie? It was one of the funniest scenes in movie history. Some scenes are out of date, of course, but Segal and Fonda carry the movie nonetheless - comedic talent like that is rare (sigh).And now they're doing a remake with Tea Leoni (urp) and the obscene-faced, wayyyyyy overrated Jim Carrey?? It's criminal!!"
3,"best thing about this movie is checking out the interiors/furniture,etc","This movie is pretty much a dud. The directing and camera work is lifeless. Segal and Fonda, although animated, have zero chemistry and the story never has a real feel to it. It's more like a dream sequence. The humor is dated and many jokes fall so flat you hardly realize they are attempts at humor. Despite this, the array of 70s interiors, furnishing, and autos was interesting and brought back repressed (for obvious aesthetic reasons) memories from my childhood. 70s must be the worst design and fashion decade ever, totally off the reservation.Anyway, Ed McMahon give an interesting performance, definitely not the straight man he's ubiquitously known as. However, one can see the story had potential, and timeliness, for the recent remake, which overall was definitely better (although not great)."
1,Another Classification Please,"Watching half of this movie made my wife and I realise there should be an additional movie classification category:""Sub IQ - under age 8 and UNDER"" -"
2,Not worth the cost,I purchased this book because I do Marquety. I found little in the book about the different techniques of the craft.
5,Great waffles every time!,"Love this waffle maker!! We recommend it to everyone that wants good, crisp waffles every time. Glad we bought it and use it at least 3 times a week. We like waffles!!"
4,LOVE LOVE LOVE,I love this eye make up remover one of the best I have ever used. Leaves my skin soft after using it and its doesn't leave any oily residue.
1,"Okay for backups but ""unacceptable"" to me.","The Iomega Rev 35 GB drive is fine for backing up and archiving files. But it has two shortcomings that make the drive ""unacceptable"" to me. For one thing, you cannot defragment the Rev cartridges. The Rev 35 drive simply does not show up when you open up Windows (2000) defragmenter. Also, I purchased Iolo Technologies Search and Recover 2 for recovering and shredding deleted files. S&R2 is a great product but, again, the Rev 35 drive does not appear in the drive list. I have contacted support at both Iomega and Iolo Technologies to no avail . . . Buy a different drive."
1,Don't Even Bother,"This has to be the worst thing I have ever read. The characters self esteme must be in the gutter because of all the guys she wants to hook up with, plus she masturbates while someone is talking to her.Whoever lives a life like this in reality I don't envy them. I am not easily shocked, but some of the stuff coming from the pages of the book were just horrendous. I paid $1.99 at an A&P for this, it would have less painful just to throw it down the drain."
3,Somewhat Disappointing,"I had heard that this book was funny and smart so I picked it up. I finished it in two days only because I cannot stand to leave a book unfinished. Although I smiled a few times during the course of my reading, I don't feel that it was worth my time. Although the sex scenes were obnoxious and there were far too many, I felt that the book's greatest fault was that the main character (Ariel Steinem) was completely unlikeable. She had a narcissistic attitude throughout the whole story, played ridiculous mind games with everyone, and to top it off, she had the annoying ability to never stop feeling sorry for herself. It's not suprising that I couldn't feel one ounce of sympathy for her whenever things started to fall apart. Save your money. If you really must read it, check it out from the library."
1,"Good Lord, is the literary apocalypse here?","Why anyone would publish, much less read this dreck is a mystery to me. Ms. Sohn has combined all of what is bad about the contemporary novel (and the contemporary woman) in one slim volume; self-centered, crude, unstylish writing is the result.She almost makes me embarassed to be a woman living in New York City. I don't know who deluded this chick into thinking she can write, but somebody needs to set her straight, fast!"
2,It has its moments....but,This book had its moments but it was kind of annoying after a while. This girl is very Jewish and very into sex. She is an office temp and wants to be an actress and ends up writing a sex column in a NewYork paper. So she is slutting it up with people and writing about it for a paper- Like I said it has its moments but it is no bestseller.
3,A bit over the top,"I liked the writing and the story line is decent enough but some of the sex episodes are incredible--few folks get there so quickly and attach so little meaning to it all, with people they hardly know. Or maybe few decent folks do. It's not the action--that's good and funky, lively and thrilling--but the related choices that just don't cut it for me."
2,One Narcissism Grande to go!,"I would like Amy Sohn (and Ariel Steiner) much better if they weren't so breathtakingly self-absorbed. Amy is a good writer, but it's hard after a while to care about and root for someone who is so completely consumed with themselves. She comes across as very insecure and very ambitious, which is a deadly combination."
3,"Though I dig Amy Sohn, I found her novel a tad ungratifying.","""Run Catch Kiss"" was a fun read--which is probably all it's meant to be--but it wasn't the novel I'd hoped for. Amy Sohn chronicles events of her life in delicious detail and frames a good, juicy story. The binding literary elements of her book, however, came across as slightly juvenile. Maybe book two will turn out to be the one I'm after."
5,Catch the fun!,"This book, although very sexually graphic at times, is quite a thrill to read and will be probably be embraced for anybody looking for a fix till the next 'Bridget Jones' Diary' book.But 'Run Catch Kiss' has it's own rewards, in the form of a deliciously sexy narrative of Ariel Steiner, a twentysomething wannabe actress who's being cast in 'the fat girl' roles. She takes her sex escapades to the streets, cranking out a scandalous column (Her father remarks, ""Your mother is thinking of getting shirts that say 'It isn't true"")in NYC's hottest weekly newspaper.But the results aren't what she bargained for. Clever, witty and downright funny, Run Catch Kiss is a fitting title to join and...overtake the troupe of 'chick lit' books that seem to crowd the shelves these days."
2,Umm....what?,"Amy Sohn's not a bad writer...it's just that she has nothing to write. This book is a rambling mess chronicling a 20 Something's sexual encounters. There isn't a shred of intellect or insight. Maybe once Amy Sohn grows up, she'll have something interesting to say."
1,awful...just awful.,"This is quite possibly one of the worst [if not the worst] books I've read. I had to push myself to finish it. The main character, Ariel, is so in love with herself...it's hard to get attached to her at all. Not only does the main character have no depth but the book is terribly written. The little sex scenes are just weird and not very, well, sexy. The ending of the book had a bunch of loose ends. All in all? Absolutely terrible. Please, don't read this. It's a waste of time."
4,Awesome - engrossing and honest,"This book was engrossing right from the first page. It is so honest about what it is like to be a single woman and have a healthy interest in sex and exploring your own sexuality but also want a nurturing ""normal"" relationship. I have recommended it to all of my friends and everyone who has read it has thanked me. If you are uncomfortable with sex and are afraid of your own sexuaility, this is not the book for you.My only criticism, and reason for the lack of the fifth star, is that some of the relationships between the protagonist and other characters were undeveloped and brought on very quickly, almost as if the author got bored with the tediousness of developing the friendship and just wanted to get right to the point. So sometimes I felt confused about where some new fully-formed relationship had come from and it seemed like I had skipped a chapter. But it is forgivable because the author does make her point and she makes it well."
3,It's no Bridge Jones but....,"not too bad by itself. I had great hopes and dreams for this book but, I wasn't knocked off my socks. It's got a bit of an edgy side, and shows signs of race and charm, but seems to lack a finishing touch. Just didn't grap me by the neck and pull me in. I read it...but, probably won't read it again. Might be heading off to the discount bookstore for resale."
1,overblown copycat,"gosh, havent we seen this boring thing eighty times already. I heard about Sohn from one of my freinds who kinda likes her, but this isnt at all what i was expecting. really bad. doesnt do anything for us women, but another bad book about how just cant get together."
2,"At best, it kills time","I decided to read this book after reading a review in my university's newspaper. It described the book as ""funny...entertaining...enjoyable."" After reading it, I must say I disagree.It follows the life of Ariel Steiner, a young woman who gets a job writing a sex column. Her love life is less than active, so after dating a few guys, she makes things up, changes some names, and publishes them in her column.Her attempts at relationships are desperate at best. She comes off as annoying and needy. I sure can understand why no man wants to keep her around. I found the novel to be nothing more than light porn and less than funny. Your money can be spent elsewhere."
5,"Light, Funny, yet lined with truth",Wow! I had my mom get me this book for Christmas and her reaction was not all that great to the request but I opened it Christmas morning. The next couple days I was holed up in my bedroom with this book loving every page. Its light and funny yet it has an underlying truth no woman can escape. Ariel is a young woman in our time coping with many struggles that every young woman faces these days. An awesome read! Great job Amy Sohn!
5,Free Your Mind,"What woman would not find this book an exciting read? If you are open-minded and do not mind ""dirty talk"", then this book should be next on your reading list. Men take note! I found Amy Sloan's details of Ariel's ""adventures"" exciting, yet comedic at the same time. It was not a moving, mind-blowing book that changed my life (like some books have), but it took me away from reality for a short time. And any book that can do that is a great novel to me."
3,WARNING LABEL REQUIRED!,"A couple of weeks ago my mother mentioned that she had just ordered a new book by my cousin, Amy Sohn. I couldn't recall any mention of cousin Amy before (I assume we are second cousins), but I thought that I would check out the book -- I'm always willing to support the family, no matter how extended. Although the book was extremely crude and sexually explicit, I was delightfully surprised at how well written and funny it was. What was even funnier to me was the thought of my poor mother reading these same passages that caused me to blush. I would recommend this book as a comical, light-hearted read. But be forewarned -- you probably don't want to recommend this book to your parents."
5,"Move over, Erica Jong & Philip Roth","When I finally looked over my young (28) niece's shoulder after trying for hours to tune out her near constant laughter, she quipped ""I'm sure this wouldn't be your cup of tea at all.""Well, I'll admit that's what got me to read the book -- her assumption that a 50-something male could not relate to the admittedly ""no holds barred"" writing that Amy Sohn has so mastered. But a plot that grabs and holds, together with humor that should reach all but the very up-tight, make this a compelling summer read!It'll be interesting to see how well Sohn fares once she takes leave of this ""Sex in the City""-like material. Heaven knows, however, that nobody does it better (when it comes to that genre).Too bad Rabelais died 446 years ago -- I'm sure he would have penned a glowing squib on the dust jacket had he had a chance to read RCK."
1,More porno than Bridget Jones,"I bought this book 8 years ago (right after graduating college) when I was in my ""Bridget Jones"" phase. I just recently picked it up for some ""single girl living in the big city"" fluff, but could not read past page 50. I had to stop the pain. The main character recently graduated college and is trying to break into the entertainment biz in NYC. ...the entire book talks about her constant masturbation experiences and one night stands with [people]. I suppose you really have to be in the mood for this book and I suppose I just wasn't. Hopefully, the Goodwill Store will be able to sell the copy I'm about to donate."
1,Awful,"Awful doesn't begin to describe it. The writing is bad, the characters are both self-absorbed and self-indulgent, and the wit is remarkably unwitty. If you like reading about sex or getting worldly advice from preening neurotics, by all means, read it. Anyone else should steer well clear."
3,"Light, fun, fluff","I basically devoured this book in three days, alternately laughing and falling asleep while doing so. When it is funny, it is laugh-out-loud funny, but at times it gets monotonous. It would be perfect for the beach or a long airplane trip; just don't expect Erica Jong. I will definitely buy her next novel, though."
5,I thought this was hilarious!,"A very good, fun read. This is for all of you twenty-somethings out there. It certainly isn't rocket science but if it's a good way to blow a couple hours."
3,Just your average soft-porn novel....,"It's not deep. It's not thought-provoking. It doesn't have much meaning either. But if you're into books that are quick, light and very...ahem...descriptive...then you will probably enjoy this novel. There are parts that are really funny, parts that are downright nasty and granted, it is somewhat interesting. I just wouldn't buy it until it's out in paperback. One last point, the way Ms. Sohn ended this novel, you can't help but wonder if RUN CATCH KISS is an autobiography."
2,YUMMY JUICY LIPS!,"Um, I really don't have much to say. I laughed. Sometimes. And then. I didn't. And then, I finished the book, and started another one. It's all a part of the cycle. Not a huge waste of money, but, don't get excited, either."
4,"If you are 22, then this is the book for you!!","As a hopelessly bored, 22 yr old recent grad stuck living at home with her parents, nothing could have pleased me more than this book. Granted Amy Sohn is not trying to appeal to the rocket scientist in all of us, but what she gets to the heart of is fun, and entertainment, and the little wish inside every young chick just starting out, that your name, just for a little while, could be the talk of the town. Of course, i wouldn't ever do half the stuff April does, but it sure as hell makes for a great read! You Go Amy!!"
2,Book I read today for which I like,"Pardon at first my English being so-not good.For once I was in the read of RUNCATCHKISS of Amy Sohn together in. Never read about of subject before I have. From, begin to the ending, I could not put down RUNCATCHKISS. Sohn remind me of before ""girlfriend"" I've have.But her use of talking words in RUNCATCHKISS, like as ""vagina"" very shocking. Come to the place many times before, what is this one for to come here?I would, read again Sohn RUNCATCHKISS, but next time more picture?"
4,It's like Sohn was writing about my lfe!,"Awesome book for any twenty something who thinks she'll never move out of her parents house, get her dream job and meet the love of her life."
5,You too will become a fan.........,"Amy Sohn, I've been a fan of your column since you started writing for the Press. For years I have wondered why you didn't write a full length novel. Well, now you have (finally!) and I applaud you. The trials and tribulations of Ariel are hilarious and very real at the same time. She/you are speaking for so many women both young and old. I find it hard to classify this book as one that only ""20-somethings"" can relate to. I also think that its a shame that the other reviewers who felt that the book was ""boring"" and ""really bad"" did not allow themselves to just go with the story and really enjoy it. The situations and men who Ms. Sohn describes in this book are real, VERY real (As a 30-something/female/New Yorker, I've been there, way too many times!.) I just don't think that we would have the chutzpa or talent to write about it as well as she. So again, big applause to you Amy! Well done. Please, please continue on!"
2,Disappointing,"I read great reviews and read this book in a couple of days, but was somewhat disappointed, expecting something more...the premise was promising, but I couldn't work up much feeling for the character. Talk about self-absorbed, imagining the whole city was aghast over her column? I think not! Unerotic pointless sex scenes, over and over...let me tell you, if you want to read a good book about a single Jewish gal yearning for love and marriage, go to the library and get out ""Sheila Levine Is Dead and Living in New York City"". A wonderful funny touching novel about a young woman in a New York that is no more, but much better written (not to be confused with a horrible movie by the same name). ""Run Catch Kiss"" confirms two things, a) that men can put their you know whats in anything and its no more than a sneeze, and b) I am so very glad I'm not a young woman living in New York."
1,run on,"I'm afraid that in my opinion (only one person, admittedly) what works wonderfully in a magazine column makes poor book fodder. Though I wanted to look deeper, there was no surface to scratch....because underneath the brash, glitzy exterior of this novel is another surface: It is like a plastic onion in revealing lingerie. Those of you mining for nuggets of hard-won wisdom will probably go without. Some laughs, to be fair, several good ones.... but mostly sighs of boredom. Perhaps this is just the book the author had to get out the way before she could write something more worthy of her talents."
2,I am sick of female twenty somethings being portrayed as des,I am so sick of twenty something females being portrayed as desperate sluts. Enough already! Amy Sohn is so concerned with staus that every single character in the novel went to an ivy league school. Give me a break!
5,great seedy writing!,"Have read three of Amy Sohn's books, and while this was my least favorite out of the three, it was still a great page turner. Prospect Park West and Motherland were more my style of fiction mixed with real Brooklyn locations..Run Catch Kiss was gritty and honest in it's writing, and definatly kept me wanting more at the end!"
1,Should have written a memoir instead,"As a writer, I know all about authors using isolated events or aspects of their lives fictitiously in novels. But Amy Sohn's Run Catch Kiss has missed the mark between fiction and memoir. It becomes certain that she took events straight out of her life and put them in the contents of this book -- or rather, wrote an autobiography disguised as a novel, period.The novel itself is trite and insubstantial. But what I could expect from a story about a wannabe-actress-turned-sex columnist? I don't think that a heroine who writes about her sexual escapades in a newspaper column is my kind of read. I borrowed this book from a friend. I now wish I hadn't."
3,Only Provocative Thing In This Book: Lips On The Cover,"I came across Run Catch Kiss at the bookstore. I read the cover, read the reviews listed inside and purchased. I was excited. Seemed like a fun, hip novel. And It was.. For a little while.I plowed through the books stories of sex and lies until the ending which I hoped would be redeeming. I was so disapointed.Ariel Steinmen loses all of one thing and keeps all of another. I think Amy Sohn was trying to portray how hard it is for young people to choose a life that is fulfilling in more than one way but she failed.The most provocative thing in this book were the lips on the cover."
2,To pay 30 bucks for a copy or not to pay,"*Sigh*I payed 30 bucks on amazon for a copy. Wish it was a tad more clearer before paying 30 bucks for a Chinese copy of this disc. This is not the uk version as pictured on this site -- I can tell ya that much. The movie itself is merely, I assume, a copy of the UK DVD so I'm not too angry about this purchase. It's what's inside that counts...I'm still annoyed that I payed 30 bucks for a Chinese copy of the UK version of Steve Wang's DRIVE (pictured on this amazon page) complete with typos on the box: ""SPECIAL 116 MINUTE UNCUT VESION""I mean I got what I wanted and all...it's just that I payed 30 bucks for a Chinese copy of Steve Wang's Drive. *Sigh*"
1,are you kidding me?,"i can't believe i bought this movie, you guys are nuts!! since there are 33 positive reviews i'll be the lone sole to say this movie is a piece of crap. everyone says this is a great martial arts flick, i'll give it the one star for some good fight scenes, although they all look like rip offs of jackie chan flicks. you remember the tv series the A-Team with Mr.T, thats the quality of this flick. the acting is horrible, the story is so stupid, the directing is very bad, ummm... did i mention this movie sucks, even for a B movie it sucks. please, if you can rent before you buy it, do so, cause its not worth seeing more than once. i just can't believe that because there are some good fight scenes that everyone is giving this film such high scores, if you review a film it should be based on the whole film, not just one thing."
4,Excellent mixture of choreography and comedy,"Although most of Mark Dascascos' lines are kind of corny, there is no disputing his martial arts ability. The action in this movie was non stop and the choreography was inventive and fun. This is just another example of Mark's flexibility in his martial arts roles. A perfect mixture of 'wirework' and non wirework martial arts. A must see for anyone looking for 90+ minutes of exciting fighting sequences."
5,One of the best US martial arts films ever,"I thought this movie would be just like most American stuff - two guys slugging it out for ages before one of them wins because the other guy collapsed... But this movie has such outstanding fight scenes that it's hard to believe that it hasn't come out of Hong Kong. The plot may be a bit weak, but have you ever thought about ""Enter the dragon""s plot?"
3,"Very good action, so so story","We get alot of action in this movie, and some witty dialogue (from Kadeem Hardison), but Mark is not given much of a speaking role. The premise is very good, but not alot of time was spent on developing it more. The action sequences were fantastic, and if I were just rating this on action, it would rate higher. I was disappointed that Mark did not have more dialogue than he did, but it is a worth while movie to rent."
5,this is a good movie,A guy name Tobie who is from China he is fighting a bunch of chinese guys but they don't want to kill him cause he's too valuable to stop him they aim for his feet. Britney Murphey character is too crazy in this movie she owns a hotel until it got destroyed by the bad guys.
2,Who was this written for?,"I read this book during the break in seasons 2 and 3. Besides the thorough section devoted to the producer's influences--the parallels to ""The Stand"" and ""The X-Files"" are interesting--it was a waste of time. It left me wondering what audience they were targeting with this book--huge Lost fans who are involved in the intertextuality of the show know all of this already, and casual fans won't be bothered by buying books. I also noticed that there is no speculation whatsoever in the book, and that it sticks to the basic facts that we all know already. Plus, it was written before the last episodes of season 2, which are critical to ""unlocking"" any meaning behind the show.Don't buy it."
3,Good information but boring (nothing new),"I had some great hopes for this book to help me through the long wait for season 3 to come onto DVD, while I ultimately wait for season 4 to start. I found allot of this to be a synopsis of the obvious. I was hoping for some intelligent theory on what is actually going on, on the island.In fact, I found quite a bit of the pontificating about various metaphors to be weak at best and just off track at its worst. Meaning I disagreed with allot of what speculation they did offer. If you frequent any LOST message boards, you will find this to be remedial and light to boring reading.If you are just getting into LOST... this would be a good place to go to get up to date before you hit any intense discussion websites etc..."
1,not helpful,What a horrible horrible book. This is not for Lost fans. This is for someone who's never seen Lost. It does not unlock or analyze anything. It pretty much reviews what has already happened. What a waste of money and time.
5,No longer LOST,"I did not get hooked on LOST The TV series until season three. This book filled in a lot of gaps for me. Excellent insights, lots of questions answered, still left the reader with room for own interpretation."
1,Don't waste your Money,"What a piece of crap and off shore support is even worse. I was only able to sync two pictures even though the spec calls for ""up to 50."" Only message is ""sync failed."" When I called support, they disconnected me the first time. When I called back, they said that it can only hold one or two pictures.The manual is very poor and says nothing about how much memory this device has. I'm assuming that my pictures are larger than the capacity of this unit, but I can't tell from the manual. I got this as a gift. Hopefully the giver didn't spend much money."
4,Deftones - White Pony (Limited Black),This group has waited since it's last release and it was well worth it. They prove they can still deliver the goods. The Limited Edition (with the black case) is worth the extra money for the bonus track.
5,deftones,The deftones have gone in a new direction with white pony and it sounds just as good as their other albums if not better. The music stands out on white pony more partly due to the addition of turntables. The only bad thing about white pony is that it doesn't seem long enough. Every single song is good but then so is all of their other songs. The deftones prove again that they are the best band ever.
4,The Best Deftones Album to Date,"this is defenitely the most fully realized and well done deftones album yet. the songs show maturity of writing that is not present at all in most ""rapcore"" albums today. Chino has the best voice in rock-n-roll today, hands down."
4,Must Buy,"If you love the deftones other cds than this is a must have. They kinda have a new style, but they still rule"
1,Vibration of boat loosens the set screw,"I bought this mirror, but it won't stay on. As soon as the boat starts bouncing, the set screw backs out and the mirror falls off. If you are able to drill a hole in order to mount it permanently, this would be a nice mirror."
4,Great set for my young artist,"Gave both of my girls a set of these watercolors for Christmas and they have been really happy with it. Nice design to keep things organized and easy to store. Perhaps a few more instructions on mixing colors and things would have been nice, but overall, a great art set for a great value."
1,WORST BRUSHES EVER,"I did not purchase this set but have purchased two new royal brushes over a month ago. They fell apart in just two uses, 10 mins each about. I contacted the company 3 times and have still never heard back. I will never buy a royal product ever again..."
5,great set for the price,This was for my teenage daughter. It really is a quality set of paint and brushes at an excellent cost.
1,never shipped,"as of march 21, 2006, this product never shipped and it was ordered in january. At this point I canceled the order, since 25% of the year is just about up. Not happy camper.Can't really rate stars about item, but won't let me post unless I do... wouldn't suggest ordering it at this point...."
5,Nature's Plus Prenatal Liquid,"After being pregnant four times and trying many different prenatal vitamins, I definately like this one the most, I feel it also improves my hair, nails, and skin... just wish it had more eco-friendly packaging."
4,Bromelain,I liked the taste but don't understand why it has bromelain in it (From pineapple). I am going to check with my doctor whether it's safe during pregnancy.
3,"Good, but could be better","This is a good prenatal vitamin for those of us who have trouble swallowing pills, but the buyer should be aware of a couple of things...1) the content of iron, Vit D and Calcium are not as high as some tablets and 2) the bottle leaks a bit for some reason (although this may just be a problem with the bottle that I have!). Otherwise, the taste is reasonable. Its a green liquid, fairly sweet, 50 calories per ""dose""."
4,Better then pills,"The taste is not bad. I have tried the product before, however, for some reason this one tasted more grainy to me. I felt like I could feel tiny sugar crystals in my mouth. However all in all I would definately rather take this then the standard pills. It does look green, but don't let that fool you, it has a bit of a fruity sweet taste, and there is no overpowering scent."
3,Gag,"Based on reviews and recommendations, I ordered this prenatal. However, I must be the kind that can tolerate 'horse pills' better - I have to convince myself everytime to take it. It is way too sweet, has a certain smell (I'm in the first trimester, so my sense of smell might be stronger), and the consistency - well, it just makes me want to throw up. Once I thought I'd drink my dose in one gulp. Bad idea. Now I take small sips and wash it down generously with some other liquid. I never thought of myself as texture sensitive, but this is surely the first product that makes me want to throw up just thinking about it. On the positive side - I like how much good stuff it has in it (wish there was more iron though)."
3,Conscientious Medical Journalism,"""Burn Unit"" shows how severe burns are treated in a modern hospital. The author presents two specific cases, following them through from admission to release at Mass General Hospital, with numerous asides explaining the history of burn treatment from the Middle Ages to today. There are even citations from sixteenth century medical writers like Ambroise Pare. It becomes clear that physicians had very little in the way of truly scientific treatment methods until well into the 20th century, and even today, the causes of certain problems resulting from severe burns are not known. Also the treatment of a severe burn is a lengthy process and the dangers of infection are considerable. The skin is destroyed and the body is thus extremely vulnerable.The medical and scientific history was very interesting to me, but the worthwhile people who staff the hospital were not and I could do without so much attention to them."
5,Bought as a gift,I bought this toy as a gift for a little girl who said the only thing she wanted for her birthday was a puppy. Unfortunatley her mom is very allerigic to dogs. I bought her the Webkinz White Terrier and another Webkinz dog. She loved these so much she did not even want to open her other presents. She just wanted to play with her new puppies.
5,Execellent Toy - Big hit with 7 Year Olds,My Daughter loves her Webkinz. Plays with it and on the web everyday. They even let her on the web at school.
5,Happy with my Webkinz,My Westie Webkinz was shipped quickly and in pristine condition. It arrived on the day my little granddaughter arrived for Spring break. She loved it!
2,disappointed,"i did not like the choice of actors, most of them are far too old for the characters they represent. some were far better in other films.i was simply disappointed after having read and enjoyed the book.sorry to say.kuno."
5,Boulez: the Greatest Conductor since Karajan...,"Everyone was totally blown-away when Boulez decided to conduct Bruckner's 8th: I don't know why, because Boulez is our greatest conductor in the world since the death of von Karajan; moreover, Boulez is an expert in Mahler and Schoenberg--Bruckner being their immediate predecessor, it stands to reason that Boulez should bring a similar insight to his oeuvre.This is a great realizaton, and a great disc since it manages to squeeze the mighty 8th on one CD without feeling at all ""squeezed.""I can hardly wait for Boulez to do Bruckner's 9th--his truly greatest work!"
4,Not Your Father's Bruckner,"If you're acquainted with Bruckner's Eighth, and very much like hearing it the way you're used to, this is not the album for you. In trying to take a different approach to this much-recorded work, Pierre Boulez has given us what one reviewer calls a Strauss-like Bruckner. He has leveled off a lot of the stark Bruckner contrasts, but in doing so, has lost much of Bruckner's power.I remember decades ago, when the favorite analogy to describe Bruckner's symphonies was ""towering cathedrals in the clouds."" Boulez appears to have planted the cathedrals in the middle of a Johann Strauss orchestra. Now, that's not all bad. It gives us a fresh interpretation of this work and still retains memories of the original.If you haven't enjoyed Bruckner, this might be just the thing to pique your interest. It's not your father's Bruckner."
3,"Ok, but don't expect too much.","Our dog really enjoys playing with these, but he's a 13 lb Shih Tzu and isn't too rough of things (before we rescued him, he had a rough life and is missing several teeth). This is almost too small for him, so I wouldn't expect it to work for a dog any larger or one that had all his teeth :D"
1,Save your money,"My little Pekingese loved this toy, however, it didn't even last through an hour of play. I was pulling fur out of his mouth.He was very upset when I had to take it from him, so was I because he really seemed to like it.Oh well, the hunt is on again for a quality pet toy. Most are just not up to snuff. I will add this one to that list.Kong does not impress me anymore, I will search for a better brand."
2,very very small toy,"I think they sent me the wrong duck toy as it is almost too small for my Papillon, tiny toy and it came with no squeeker inside of it, but they sent an extra squeeky, so I did end up at least with one to put inside it. They must have sent an extra small and the description says small."
2,Extra Small - Easy to Tear Up,"Just received this little duck yesterday. My puppy played with for about 30 minutes squeaking it like crazy yesterday. Then today she played with it for about 15 minutes & when I turned around she had the duck chewed open & was eating the squeaker. I don't know if the material was too thin or what but it was worse than chewing open one with stuffing, at least they have to get past the stuffing to get to the squeaker. I would not buy again & would not recommend."
3,great idea,Being able to replace the squeaker is a great idea and works well! My terrier apparently didn't like the feel or texture of the velcro closer and and proceeded to remove the velcro from 3 different toys.
1,Did not last,The product lasted about 5 minutes with my dog...total waste of money. I am not satisfied with the quality of the item.
1,Choking hazard,My dog would choke to death on this product. I can't believe that no where do you say how tiny it is.I will return for FULL credit.
1,beware of this toy,"my dog had this toy for 5 min. before it was in pieces with the squeeker in her mouth. i thought Kong toys where ment to be sturdier than that. thank goodness i was in the same room. what a piece of junk. i guess you get what you pay for. if i could rate it a minus star i would i'm so upset. dangerous toy, dont buy"
1,don't waste your money,"I bought this one b/c of amazon reviews and wasted $5 b/c of it. The word ""kong"" is misleading. This is not a durable toy and within 2 minutes or less my dog chewed it to bits"
4,Cute,"Cute and soft. Comes with an extra squeaker, which is a good thing. Squeaker did break within five days, but easy to replace. Animal is still intact and second squeaker is working even though we play tug-of-war a few times each day. Perfect size toy for small dogs (Bichon/Yorkie mix)."
1,Great if your dog is toothless! The squeek was broken in 15 min.,"The people who make this toy, Kong, make terrific hard rubber toys but the plush toys are awful. My little dog managed to break the first squeeky in 15 minutes, the replacement squeeky lasted a few minutes longer. When the sewing started to unravel the next day - into the trash it went. It was the first toy my dog managed to destroy in less than 24 hours."
3,They still tore it up!,It took about three weeks with this toy and not a day like usual but they still tore it up. At least there was not stuffing everywhere when they were done! Also came with a broken sqeaker in the toy so we actually didn't get an extra one.
1,Very poor quality,This was given to a four pound Yorkie and within a few days was rubbish. Squeaker stopped and it began to fall apart.
1,Not for labs,"This toy may be okay for some really small dogs, but after a few minutes my young lab (less than a year) tore this to pieces."
2,Small.,This toy was too small for my 70lb dog to really enjoy. No stuffing to pull out makes it nice but then again that's apparently part of the fun.
1,Don't waste your money!,Purchased through Amazon...cute toy but didn't last a day. My small dogs aren't destructive of their toys but these had holes and were unstitched in less than an hour.
2,"Great toy, but dog tore it apart in 30 minutes","Our 23 pound medium golden doodle manages to destroy all stuffed toys, so we were excited to hear about this toy as it sounded more durable. However, she managed to pull apart the nose and pull all the stuffing out in under 30 minutes. So it's not as durable as it seemed. Great toy though, but it's not a toy for aggressive chewers."
4,Good so far!,"I bought this toy for my dog on a whim (because I wanted to get free shipping) and so far it has been great. She is a small dog so it is just the right size for her. Also, unlike many of her other toys, she has not destroyed it yet. It also comes with an extra squeaker that you can put into the back of the toy if the other one breaks (there is velcro that you open to put it in). So far so good!"
3,Okay..,"Cute toy, but...I have a mini dachshund and she isn't that aggressive a chewer but after a while she tore this thing to pieces. She ripped the arm off and after that we had to throw it away. It's a good toy if your dog is out of the teething stages maybe and tends not to destroy everything, I like that I could wash it and easily replace the squeaker."
3,Nice toy but..,I bought a few of these toys and each one of them my Teacup Chihuahua who weighs in at 4 pounds has taken the stuffing out of them all.One or two of them she had the stuffing out in less than a day the others in a week.She still enjoys the outter shell of these toys and for that I give it 3 stars.
2,Doesn't hold up to my 13lb Terror,"Looks like a great concept with the velcro to be able to take out the squeaker for washing or to replace it. Execpt my little chewer ripped one side of the velcro right out of the stitching in the first ten minutes of play.She then proceeded to rip off pieces of the beak, foot, hair, stuffing... what a mess. Glad it was so cheap, I have to throw it out after a couple days use.Might be good if you dog doesn't chew at things aggresively, but if it does then I wouldn't bother with this."
4,Great Toy for small dogs,"We have two small dogs (20lbs) and this is a great little toy for them, especially for the price!"
4,Split Decision!,"Our Aussie ouppy absolutely loves this toy, and we are actually on our fourth one. However, our pomeranian, for whom we bought it, would not play with it at all. The only lasts a couple of days with our Aussie before she has the squeaker torn out, the feet and beak chewed completely off, and its wings ""clipped."" Overall, it is well worth the money for a weekly toy..."
3,Duck for fun,"Our little hound likes this duck, but it seems to have a squeaker that is too small and weak...which does not go over well since she likes to beat up her duck and try to make him tap out by squeaking!"
5,Technodog,Great toy for smaller dogs. I gave one of these to ours neighbors dog and it quickly became one of his favorites. Very durable and can be machine washed. Good investment for your K9 friends.
5,puppy's best friend,"For a plus toy, especially a small one, this one has been extremely durable! Our puppy, who loves to pull eyes, lips, feet off of toys has done no damage to this little duck yet other than kill the squeaker. It was the least expensive toy we purchased at the time and it has lasted the longest! Kong puts an extra squeaker in it for good reason, but otherwise it has been a great companion for our puppy so far (and he's already 25 lbs!). Definitely recommended!"
3,Cute toy,Its a little smaller than I expected but quality is good for a smaller dog to play with. Not bad.
3,Dog Toy,"Ordered this for my Maltese. It is very small and doesn't have a lot of stuffing. Kind of flat, but actually my dog has played with it a lot. I was expecting a little bigger toy."
5,LOVE,My Shih Tzu loved this so much! She had it in her mouth from the time I first gave it to her until I finally had to take it away. The extra squeaker came in handy!! It is VERY small though so do not give this to a large dog!
3,"Not bad, didn't last too long.","This toy wasn't too bad, it lasted a couple days which is pretty good for my mini schnauzer. He disabled the squeeker first, then eventually ripped the rest of the duck. When is says small, it really is small. Not bad for smaller dogs."
2,"""An OK Story That Could Have Been Better.""","Mark Strang was a pretty decent character, but I felt there was a lot of untapped potential that Barnes did not bring to the surface. He did do a good job with the scenes where Strang questioned his lust for killing anything associated with the enemy Closers. I also did not get a sense of any great crisis as Strang fights to keep this alternate 1775 on its intended track. The changes to this timeline were pretty cool. I am a sucker for time travel/alternate Earth stories. I liked the introduction of steam engines and dirigibles to 1775. And George Washington, Duke of Kentucky? Neat twist. The action scenes were OK, but tended to get a little too wordy at times."
4,Solid old fashioned fun,"Solid old fashioned fun and games written by an author who is rapidly developing into my favorite 90's writer. Everytime I go into a bookstore, I seek the B's to see if something new is out.Here with his third installment of his Timeline Wars, comes John Barnes, meticulous researcher,yet developing writer. I find the plot in this the weakest element but not as bad as say anything by Steven King. This is well worth both the time and money."
4,Good adventure and reasonable heros,"This is the weakest of the three books in the series but only because it lacks the excitting beginning and the strong ending of the adventure. The plot and the heros hang together well even if you haven't read the previous book. Barnes does a good job of exploring what might have happened if many scientific advances had come along centuries early. His science is reasonable, and the story flows very well."
3,Great for a while,"If you're looking for a shorter term waffle maker, then this is a great one. It's difficult to clean the iron afterwards, and now, after about 2 years of use, the waffles are sticking and it is also cooking very uneven. Until now, it worked awesome! (oh, and the recipes that come with it are great!)"
5,"Bravo, Bravo, Bravissimo!","These arias from La Traviata, Lucia di Lammermoor, Linda di Chamounix, I Puritani and Rigoletto have been recorded often (Too often) but among recent recordings I like Marcelo Alvarez's recordings of them the most. He has a most velvety and gorgeous timbre, wonderful high notes and he phrases sensitively, he uses vocal colours to shade and illuminate every phrase making him a great successor of lyric tenors like Giuseppe di Stefano and José Carreras. Of course he is individual but just as amazing as these guys! Bravo Monsieur Alvarez!"
5,"Nice glasses, excellent price","These are very nice sunglasses, and the price is pretty much unbeatable. The only thing I did not like was the brick sized case. A smaller, more purse-friendly case would have been better. However, since I am wearing the glasses, rather than the case, I give this purchase 5 stars."
3,Flaws,"This is a very creative and well-illustrated book, but it is not accurate with the history. A lot of the pictures look different than what the events actually looked like and they left out a lot of information.The biggest flaw said that Kristi Yamaguchi fell in her Olympic performance. This is not true. She fell on a jump she had never landed in competition at the 1992 WORLDS one month later, but she still won the gold for that."
1,Not a good foam pump.,The soap shoots straight out of the pump and can go about three feet. (Children would love this feature.) You have to hold your hand awkwardly in front of the spout to keep the soap in your hand or pick up the pump and pump it directly into your palm. Also the pump sticks and has to be pulled up manually. You cannot use this pump with one hand - not good for kitchen use.
2,You can do better,"I ordered this foam pump to make better use of the Dr. Bronners liquid soap that I use. When I saw bad reviews, I hoped to defend it. No. It squirts straight ahead. Sometimes you catch the soap, sometimes the soap hits the wall, sometimes the floor. The pump goes down, but you have to pull it back up.For the price of this pump, I got 6 nice looking plastic pump bottles on eBay that actually work. They look almost as good as this one. The style of this one is OK, but certainly not dramatic enough to make up for the lack of function."
2,Half Good !,The pump has to be manually pulled back up after being pushed down. I have not contacted the company due to time constraints.If it worked properly I would be completely happy!
4,Reasonable,"The Sterkarm Handshake was an excellent book. The characters, for instance, were perfection in literary form. There's the man you love to hate, the chubby girl who shines through at last, and the dorky yet sweet caveman. There's even a guy who balances on the edge of good and evil. If a bit cliche-y, it remained true to form during the entire book, and followed through on it's original promise to enthrall. The SH is a book I'd recommend to teens in search of a read that that has intrigue, a deluge of fabulous characters, and a wonderful side of Sci-Fi."
5,"Clever, authentic, yet refreshingly different","This is a time travel book with a difference. It's a fantastic read - exciting, beautifully described, and with a real feel of authenticity about the 16th century. It's not just the drab clothing (bright colours are expensive, and only for best) or the smells (the animals are stabled on the ground floor) it's the attitudes and morals. Fat is attractive. Allegiance is to the family - the Sterkarms - not to truth, or justice, or fair play. And yet you can understand it - that's how things must have been when news travelled slowly, and laws were unenforceable. I believed in this society in a way I rarely have done in other books, and I found myself slowing down at the end because I didn't want to finish it. Fortunately, there's a sequel."
4,The Sterkham Handshake,"The Sterkham Handshake is a interesting book.As well as being awarded a prize for the childrens fiction it is rated highly all over the world.I think this book has lived up to its potential greatly and that is why I rated this book four stars.I recommend this book to all that read this review and I hope that you will take my advice on this wonderful,sensational book."
2,Just okay...,"Have been looking forward to reading this book for a while, as it has received many positive reviews here and elsewhere. What started out as a compelling story line, quickly turned into tedium and annoyance mixed with flashes of action. I kept telling myself to pick it up again, to keep going. Alas, halfway through, I gave up for good. A disappointment."
2,Disappointing!,"I read this book after reading Beginning Java 2 by Ivor Horton and Slack's book is a poor comparison to Horton's. I'm sure that a person could probably learn Java by reading this book but why do it the hard way? Try Horton's book, you'll be impressed."
5,Great Book,I took a year long course in school with this book and I am only 14 and I still found it easy to use and great to understand.
3,"Sounds great, but loading/switching time is ridiculous","I bought this along with Sony's 42"" plasma TV to regain some space in our living room (previous rear projection screen, Sony ES series amp with Cambridge Soundworks speakers). Didn't expect the surround imaging to be so much better with the CA990. Great, clear sound for both movies and acoustic instrument CD's. Big complaint: ridiculous disc loading and swapping times. Also, when using component video connection and progressive scan mode, composite inputs are not ""upconverted"" (unfortunate given the plasma's dirth of inputs). [...]"
2,Dream again,"This one will make you dream about something else. I'm returning mine after two days and starting my search again.The surround sound is great, but the sound quality leaves a lot to dream about. The speakers are just not good enough to output good sound.The worst part of the system is the remote control. The buttons on the remote are very small and while watching DVD I had to restart several times because buttons are to close together."
1,"Great looks, Mediocre sound","I've owned the DAV-c990 Dreamsystem for over two years. Looks great in my living room, but the first thing I noticed is it just doesn't have the best sound, especialy for music cds. Movies sound OK. I am currently having problems with it reading discs, ejecting discs etc. I've gone thru all the troubleshooting I could find in the manual, on line and thru Sony. It still doesn't work.I've learned from research on the web that many people have had the same problems. I hope I can get mine fixed. I recomend moving on to a different unit or brand."
3,It's OK,"If you are looking for a focus on the dramatic-structure, with emphasis on each point(Inciting incident, Crisis, Resolution.....etc) then look elsewhere. If you are looking for classical theatrical plays where the dramatic-structure is employed, then I would recommend this book. George provides brief details about the plays in relation to the traditional, dramatic structure."
4,Absolute Must,"Whether we were dropping mud filled ""water balloons"" on the mayor's head or fighting forest fires in the American west, I always felt like I was right beside Flanigan. The author, Jack Gilroy, takes the reader on an eye opening American journey from an angle that few have explored. Every young student should have the opportunity to travel with Flanigan an examine his way of thinking. You may not agree with everything he says or does, but you'll certainly admire his courage and conviction."
5,What A Great Book!,"Marc Frattasio has done a wonderful job of telling the story of the New Haven Railroad's dining car department and onboard food service in Dining on the Shore Line Route. This book has something to appeal to every railroad fan; well-researched historical narratives, loads of photos, and a big selection of recipes. I especially appreciated the photographs of the train crews (especially all the hostesses and other women), the first-person stories by railroad workers about their adventures working on the trains, the illustrations (and stories) about all the dining car china patterns used by the railroad, and of course the interesting recipes. This is a great book on an interesting aspect of the New Haven's history that up until now has been undocumented."
3,Half Full,"The Art of Ensemble of Chicago never quite seemed to fit the ECM mold, and I was surprised to find that the group had been included in the first batch of :rarum releases. A quick rule of thumb for this release is that the odd-numbered cuts are generally OK, while the even-numbered cuts are pretty well unlistenable. Let's be optimistic and report the glass half full."
4,Love it,Got this a spor of the moment deal played the first game in the series and this is better but diffrent. Would recomnd it.
2,Pentatonic Box 1 or 2 ????,"The recoring is great...all the four note bends sound good and pre note bends too. Wolf Marshall probably the best guitar signature transcriber around, nails each note perfectly.The problem I have with this is that the notes are played higher up the fretboard than Albert played them.I know he was left handed - playing a right handed guitar upside down (like Hendrix) but did not restring the instrument. He also tuned down one & half tones (3 frets).This makes four note bends impossible on the top string in standard tuning, (YOU WILL PROBABLY BREAK HIGH E STRINGS)which is the way Wolf Marshall recorded it for this package.If you try the DVD from the same company (Hal Leonard) 'Albert King signature licks' by Andy Aledort, you will see them played in the correct positions.Anyway I bought both at the same time & was not sure who to believe. This means that this package is not much use afterall.Darren.Dundalk - Ireland."
2,Not their strongest,"I didn't like this album very much. I don't know why. It just....wasn't very interesting. I didn't find ANY songs that caught my interest at all. I was very disappointed.Then again, I don't really know why I don't like it. Maybe because it's rather bland? I don't know. It's just not very interesting at all."
4,Exciting at end,"As I read this book I noticed that I couldn't get some of the beginning of the book without reading the first 2 books of its series, but this may be the reason that this book was boring in the beginning. The beginning is boring because it is just talking about how Gallen, Maggie, Orick, and Tallea land on the planet ruin and get picked up by King Felphs who is the King of the planet and they just get introduced to other people and learn about things that happened in the past and a lot of other things. But as you progress through the book it gets fun and exciting because of what happens through the Tangles and how certain actions at the end happens. So overall I would say this was a pretty good book and I would recommend this book to all readers, but especially patient ones."
3,Great value again from Buy.com,"Although the tester should work as advertised, I was very disappointed that the item I received was completely different from the picture advertised. KD may have changed the design, But I wish Amazon would have updated thier photo of what they were shipping. In this case I would have went elsewhere,although more expensive, to purchase the one pictured. I did not contact them to ask about this issue, so I guess I will live with what I bought. The pictured tester looks much more durable then the plastic one I received."
1,Propoganda,"Expecting to learn the truth about the Chechen War from Anna Politkovskaya is like expecting to learn the truth about the Iraq War from Michael Moore. Very biased and propogandic account by a Liberal reporter who has claimed to want to be the ""Russian Michael Moore."" Anna tries to make excuses for the terrorist acts committed by Chechen Jihadists. Too much has happened since she wrote this book, and there is no sympathy for Wahabbi terrorists who strap suicide belts on brainwashed women and send them into restaurants, subways, concerts, airplanes, and kindergardens. If you want to know the real facts about Chechnya, read a book by an American counter-terrorist expert, Wolves of Islam."
3,Basic,"This is a very basic, short board book. Not bad, but for a dollar or so more, you could get better books."
4,Exactly what I expected.,The book arrived in really good shape for being used. the book arrived before the projected time frame. I am a happy shopper.
5,"Cute, Short Book","This book is perfect for my son who absolutely loves construction trucks. He has to read this book every night. It's a little short, but it's cute and he loves it."
2,small book,"was not impressed with this book. Very small for the price, I put it towards another book with more information"
3,Much smaller than expected,"This is an OK book, but it is very small. I didn't realize how tiny it was until it came in the mail."
1,The Retarded Wheel,"I put two of my foo fighter cds in the thing. After cranking it, i buffed it down. To my absoltute shock and horror there were more scratches all over my discs. So i am confused, i read everywhere that this is a fantastic product, well its not and i am severly dissapointed, i have to run now and buy back my foo fighter cds it destroyed."
5,This item paid for itself long ago.,Think I bought the Skip Doctor back in 1998-1999 somewhere in there. It's repaired several cds including one CDR. (Didn't know it could do that until I tried)This thing is a miracle worker. The only thing I don't like about it is the short lifespan of the resurfacing wheels. After about 3-4 cds it becomes unglued.And the so called special resurfacing fluid is basically purified water. So don't go and waste $7 on the bottle. Go out to the local store and buy a good case for $2.50.Highly recommended. (Don't go out and get those fake cd fixers. One audio expert told me long ago... all it is is car polish.) o_O
1,It sucks!!!,"I used it on one cd which i thought it could fix,i was wrong,all it did is doom it to the life of an indoor frisbee,luckily,there was a trash can nearby!!!"
1,Don't spend the loot on this!,"What a nightmare of a product. Not only is it bulky, but it is a horrible product to use on CDS/DVDS with light scratches. Made it worse, after following the instructions so carefully!(...)I should have settled for a measly dial cleanup kit. :( :(Negative stars all the way!"
1,Not the bargain that it appears,"I had this product for about 6 months and used it maybe 3 times a month. Despite meticulous cleaning and drying, the unit froze up because of a small amount of liquid seeping in around the blade...Poor design. With much work, hot soapy water and mineral oil for lubrication at seal, the unit worked, but leaked manufacturing oil and would always put oil into the blended liquid. The 2 speed switch is very cheaply made and started to malfunction. The stick blender needed to be scrapped. A much better-designed blender and worth looking into is the KitchenAid 3-Speed Immersion Blender #KHB2351. This has detachable parts for cleaning and has the drive motor and shaft always outside of and above the blended or chopped food. WITH THE ABOVE TOASTMASTER STICK BLENDER, YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR - CHEAP."
3,toastmaster 1740,I like the price and size. The head fits into a mug or cup for blending. The newer model I bought is more noisy and I'm having the same problem I've always had. The speed /engage button is difficult to keep engaged. All said its a descent blender for the price.
4,works,"I haven't needed this since buying a counter blender, which i bought for its food processor. Still this was a great product when I needed it for mixing brownies and cookie dough."
1,Don't waste your time and money,It stopped turning after using it for less than 5 times. Opened it and found the adapter connecting the motor and the shaft broke because it is made of plastic. I can't understand how it passed UL and ETL with the design like that. Don't waste your money.
2,Not very good,"Smells like burning electronics, leaks oil or some other kind of goo out the bottom, VERY loud, and it is hard to clean (to my standard of clean anyway)"
1,Underpowered,"If your need is to whip up something light and easy then this may be for you. However, if you need to whip more than a couple eggs for breakfast you may want to try something with a bit more power. Glad I purchased two because I burned out the first in about 10 minutes of use. Clean up is a breeze for simple eggs but working with a cake batter takes a bit more time as a thicker product hides in a lot more places. Would be better if the motor detached to allow for a more complete cleaning. Again, cleaning is not much of an issue when you only get to use it once."
4,Toastmaster 1740 Immersion 2-speed hand blender,"This is a good value. I use the blender to make my morning protein shake. It's simple to use and easy to clean. Would make a good gift, too."
1,"Cheap price, cheap quality",I make a lot of sauces and soups and so I needed an immersion blender. This one I bought because it was recommended. The blender did not even last six months before it just stopped working one day.
1,Fell Apart,"This item worked okay for a while, although it didn't get all the lumps out of my protein shake mix, but after limited use the hi/low switch fell off."
1,Burned up after 3 uses,"This is not a quality blender at all... I owned a Kitchen Maid one before and expected this to be a little less, but no so bad. Rather not spending any money than buying this cheap tool that is mediocre at cutting, difficult to wash, gets really warm and then too soon is burned up and never starts again. If you want a blender buy a good one."
2,Amazing until it starts leaking gunk into your food.,"Have been using this hand blender for about 3 months (so perfect for mixing protein shakes..., then I notice a nasty smell and gunk coming out of the bottom. no matter how many times I clean it, the stuff just keeps coming out. It looks greasy, but it smells absolutely rotten. I opened the thing up and it was full of rotten gunk that apparently goes up the the blade shaft while mixing. literally tried to wash it out, to no avail. have to throw it away since there is no feasible way to clean it. (it seriously could not get more rotten). I did not however experience any of the motor burning out or blade falling off issues I've read in here. (so I gave it an extra star for lasting so long....lol)"
1,Don't waste your money,I knew I wouldn't use this much so I chose to buy a cheaper model. The very first time I used it the unit overheated and the motor just quit. I tried turning it off for awhile to see if letting it cool down would remedy the problem. An hour later it wouldn't even turn on. I pitched it in the trash! I wish I hadn't wasted my money!!! Total disappointment!!
2,"Lasted 6 months with occasional light use, then fell apart and electrocuted me","Good points:1. It's really, really cheap.2. This blender worked well while it worked and was easy to clean.Bad points:1. You have to hold down the speed button for as long as you want to run the blender. This gave me cramps in my hand.2. Loud3. Has a moderate tendency to splash (I've had better, I've had worse).4. Fell apart after 6 months; the switch broke and the handle began to split. Due to the breakage I suffered a light electric shock from touching the sauce that the appliance was immersed in.My conclusion? Spend twice as much for a good hand blender, which will last longer and save you money in the long run."
1,Poor Engineering,"I have this unit. After a few uses, the rocker switch broke. It is a very simple plastic rocker, and is too flimsy to withstand even light usage. I have written to Toastmaster for parts, but I am not optimistic on a $13 item.UPDATE. Toastmaster ignored my letter and I tossed it out. I bought a Braun at Tuesday Morning for an incredible price."
2,AN SUBJETIVE ENCICLOPEDIA,"It¡s a very subjetive enciclopedia, with some blanks (don't speak about some old legends from the comics)."
3,would be an excellant cd.....,"Would be an excellant cd BUT for the fact that the music that is suppose to ""complement""(in the background) the loon calls & lake sounds but doesn't. instead it really over-whelms them & is VERY annoying..... Good thing this isn't the only loon call cd i ordered but i'm still disappointed."
3,Blues guitar with soul,"This is a somewhat disappointing DVD, Its not that his guitar playing is off , its good but its just not what I expected and what he is most known for - brilliant electric guitar work with a masterful mix of blues, swing and a touch of jazz. I didnt expect him to be playing so much in the style of Robert Johnson and other delta blues musicians. Actually. If you want to hear or learn that style you should find lessons from the guy who did the introduction, Woody Mann, he's the best."
5,New Version of Old Favorite,"I love this waffle maker! I had a 15-year old Belgian waffle maker by Toastmaster that recently quit on me, so I was thrilled when I found that Toastmaster still makes this waffle maker after a lot of searching. It's just like the old version that makes crisp, deep pocketed waffles better than any other waffle maker I have tried."
5,Switch assembly from ACDelco,"It is a good quality product by AC Delco GM,so far, it has been working right and it was easy to install."
3,Not what he expected.,"We had to return, the part did not match up to my husband's vehicle. We will try again to order."
3,had part for different model had to return it for another,had part for different model had to return it sent it back and had the right one in a couple of days sooner than I expected.had part for different model had to return it for another
5,A film above all in it's genre!,"I have never seen anything like it. Beautiful camera, settings, story line, everything. The action is unmatched, and the fighting was so intense you would almost believe it was all real. This movie definately is a must see for any film lover, not just martial arts films. My all time favorite on screen hero, and im sure he'll be yours after you see this film."
5,One of the best movies in a long time!!!!!!!,The movie was written very well the actors played there roles very well. It was the best movie in a while that I have seen.
2,several problems,"After having this mixer for about one year, the beaters started bumping into each other and falling out in the middle of mixing. Also, when I use the burst of power feature, I have to turn the mixer all the way up to level 6 and then back down to off, or it won't turn off. My mother bought this same model about the same time I did last year, and after one use, it just wouldn't turn on anymore. One positive thing is that the Sunbeam customer service has been friendly and easy to deal with. My mom's replacement mixer seems to be working fine. I will get mine in a couple of weeks, and we'll see how it works!"
1,I Agree with other reviewers,"The blades on my mixer also gave up, after using it occasionally for only a couple of years. The mixer still runs, but I'm not going to spend $20 to get new beaters, for a $30 mixer. Obviously, I do not recommend this mixer."
4,Love it,I got the mixer at the end of Sep / beginning Oct ... I used it every week since than and have no complains. Power and attachements are good enough for any baking or cooking.
1,Good for reading but Not for testing,This book had a lot of valuable information for personal use.I studied this book thoroughly. It was useless as a testing resource.There were very few items on the test aligned with the test questions and answers in the book.This book is not as intense as the test.
2,Coat Caddy Disappoints,"I'm sorry to say that this item was very disappointing, due mostly to the poor quality of a small but critical part made of very chincy plastic.As desribed, the actual hangar itself is made of a very high grade wood. But the unit that supports the hangar and mounts via spring-loaded tension between the posts under the headrest is poor quality plastic -- and not well designed.As a result, the unit broke less than a week after I received it simply because I bumped it.A similar car hangar device that I owned lasted me about three years. It's base unit was made of plastic, too. When I received this one I thought I was going to be even happier because of the beautiful wood hangar design. But without a better support device, this is just a nice hangar that has no useful purpose to me now. Perhaps my dog will enjoy chewing on it."
1,Bad Product and Bad Company,"This is the worst product I have ever purchased on Amazon. The poor quality of this product will give you about 2 days of use. What makes it worst is that I tried to send it back to Marina, and the address they have listed is not an actual address Oh yeah, they don't answer their phones and have no messaging service. Don't buy from them!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,DON'T BUY IT,"I wish I read the reviews before I bought it. It broke immediately. The main support piece appears to be metal in the picture, but it is cheap plastic.I returned the piece to be replaced and never heard back.DON'T BUY IT."
1,Junk Junk Junk,I purchased this for my husband and it is totally flimsy and way over priced. It is made of plastic and the holes are too small for the pegs to fit into. In my opinion the only way someone could be satisfied with this product is if they didn't expect that it be a functional piece of equipment. It isn't worth $1 much less $29 (plus $7.50for shipping)
2,Misleading Shipping Costs!!!,The car hangar i recieved from Marina Partners was as described. When I ordered it I thought that $12 seemed tobe a little high for shipping but paid it. When I recieved the package it clearly noted that shipping cost only $5.25. I contacted Marina Partners asking for the extra $6.25 that they conveniently took from me and said that they couldn't refund me. Dont buy from Marina Partners!
3,"You get what you pay for, or maybe not quite","This hanger is a bit overpriced, even at $29. The connecting parts are plastic painted to look like metal. It rattles and clicks even when carefully installed and generally feels pretty flimsy. Probably more appropriately priced at $5 - $10. But it is a nice place to hang your coat if you don't want to block a rear window. I certainly wouldn't buy another and woudn't consider it a nice gift for anyone I cared about."
5,Marina Travel Valet Car Hanger Coat Caddy,"The Marina Travel Valet Car Hanger Coat Caddy is an excellent product. I use it all the time. When I hang my coat/jacket, it does not block the view from the rear seat window. Everyone that sees the car hanger comments on how nice it is. I am very pleased with the product. It works very well."
5,"Great product, high quality","Love the product! The wood is beautiful and looks great in my car. I read the other comments regarding the attachment, but haven't had any similar problems myself.Would definitely recommend the product."
3,Not pleased with shipping,"I loved the product but not in the manner it was shipped - the outer plastic box is not meant to be used as a shipping box. When it arrived, the product was in great shape but it was embarassing to give as a gift."
2,Buyer Beware,"After installation, I bumped into the hanger and it broke. The piece that mounts between the headrest supports is plastic and breaks easily. Try to find a unit that has metal components."
3,Quality looks like reduced price...NOT $80.00,"Don't expect this to look like shiny, expensive grained wood...It doesn't. The hanger is a flat color and almost looks like plastic. Looks as if it's worth about 20.00 at the most."
5,Very Good Product,Easy to install and very solid. Handsome wood and holds clothes high enough in my compact car that they do not hit back seat floor.
4,Quality air rachet,"The little time I did use this it works pretty good, don't recall the model a friend had but his rachet seemed to unbolt alot faster then my air rachet."
4,"Good Ratchet , but not a knuckle buster","Been using this 3/8"" ratchet professionally for several months now, and its a good ratchet.You can change the direction of the exhaust.I've had other ratchets from snap on and matco, and those 3/8"" ratchets have been knuckle busters, this one isnt but I guess that could be a good thing.This ratchet although strong, doesnt seem as strong as those others.One thing that is annoying is when you change directions theres a pin that pops up and prevents the reverse switch from switching all the way, you gotta mess with it to change directions."
3,Is the above review still valid?,"Well, the above review is not a positive one for this product. However, it is over a year and a half old. The review references square lids, and the lids in the picture appear to be round. So am I to beleive that Tilia has fixed the problem or re-designed the product? If anyone has any recent experiences with this product, please post a review."
2,difficult to read for the layman,it requires a lot of effort if it should be read by a person without the background in the subject. i couldn't get much out of it.
1,Don't bother,I don't understand why anyone would lionize a scientist (Duesberg) who opposes the fact that AIDS is caused by a virus. Duesberg's theories on AIDS are total hogwash and dangerous hogwash at that. A book on Duesberg is a waste of paper.
5,Stimulating and Thought Provoking,"I was impressed. I invite you to read this fascinating book and decide for yourself whether Duesberg has a point or two. I took time from a busy schedule to see quickly how the saga would end, and came away enlightened by a rich body of information about issues of profound significance that cry out for resolution. The message is quite serious, but the presentation is buoyed by abundant humor and wit - a pleasure to read. This is one of those books that will inspire unending conversations with friends and colleagues. Rarely have I been as moved by a book as by this very scientific biography.""Gerald H. Pollack - Professor, Dept. of Bioengineering, University of Washington, Seattle"
2,no for me,"There are some interesting patterns, but not enough to get me to buy this book. I don't knit or embroider. If a book doesn't have at least half of patterns that I like and am willing to try, I don't buy the book. If you knit/crochet/embroider then I recommend this book."
2,Depressing Book,"I didn't like this book very much. It was recommended to me because I was having my first child at 41, and I was nervous about it whether I would be a good mom. It was interesting, but too ""heavy"" for my taste. The focus was possibly realistic, but I didn't find it comforting at all."
5,For the Mom-to-be!,"This book is a perfect read when you are pregnant, and the meaning you take from it changes even more after you give birth. I have shared this book with 5 other friends who loved this read as new mothers."
2,Maybe good for after birth??,"This book is supposed to be what the mother goes through during pregnancy. Though some of it is accurate, I'd have to say that it's not something that I wanted to read while pregnant. It was suggesting things that pregnant women think about that were negative and thoughts I wouldn't have thought had I not read this book. One story in there is about a woman who goes through 'excruciating' labor and some about miscarriages.It does have some valid information and may be good for some in the field and this is the only reason why I gave two stars. If you're looking for an upbeat pregnancy book that will encourage you and help you with what you're going through - this book is not for you."
2,too diluted,"I'd be happy to order this on Amazon if it weren't such a diluted product.The same company, Botanical Laboratories, also owns the Symtec brand of Joint Movement liquid for human consumption, which has about three times the concentration of glucosamine, chondroitin, and MSM that their doggy product has, for about the same price at Costco.So for now, it's 3 tablespoons for me, and one for my German Shepherd dog Pepper, every day until Botanical Laboratories decides to even up the score--and I'm sure Pepper would prefer Bacon over Mixed Berry flavor!"
1,Sounds great until you get one,So I received this today in the mail and it was in perfect condition. I had read some reviews about them arriving cracked/damaged. After about 9 hours of use in the 90 degree heat of my leopard gecko's tank I heard a crack and the upper half of the cave (not the lower half that takes all the heat from the UTH) split in half. I'll be getting my money back.
1,poor quality,"Already had one of the caves, reason for purchase of anotherone. The new one is molded to thin, it was cracked in half.A lot of this was due to poor packing. The quality of thisone vs the one I already have can not be compared. poor,poor, poor"
1,JUNK 2nd one cracked before use! Worthless!!!!!,"First one cracked, second one just got--washed it off, and cracked. Junk! It's still cracking as I type this. I did manage to get a crack on video. It's cracked so loudly it made me jump. Yes, that bad! Unreal! STAY CLEAR AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT!"
3,One mistake,"Opening the package I see 1/2"" hose. Hmmm...three sprinklers on 1/2""... we'll see. One of the hoses is made wrong - with female connector at each end. Am I going to send it back? No... if they can't figure out how to make a hose the first time... I'll buy an adapter.After a week I'm rewriting my review. I originally left a review of disappointment as the spray patterns did not meet when stretched out and sprinkler volume varied. Watering during different times of the day I realized city water pressured was low during high demand and otherwise the sprinklers worked fine. I say now that I would buy again and but for the hose end problem I would rate higher."
3,ok but don't try to add more than together,"I bought 2 sets to connect end to end to water the side yard. Even with our super water pressure, the last sprinkler barely covered a 1 foot wide circle. The next furthest sprinkler didn't do much better. They work okay in 3s. The first sprinkler can put out about a 6-7 ft circle, the second about 5' and the last about 2-3 ft. I think the 1/2"" hose that connects the sprinklers should be increased & maybe the output would be better."
3,Works but wow-it is ever so cheap!,"First, my product seems to have a differnet hose than the one pictured above - and it is by far one of the most inferior/poor quality types of hose I've encountered to date. The actual sprinklers are all plastic so no worry about rust - but they are also very light weight and prone to move about easily. In a nutshell, this product works but for how long is another question entirely. For just a little more money I purchased three hose remnants and sprinkler heads here on Amazon - of MUCH better quality. I'm glad I only purchased one of these...given the cheap production we'll see how long it lasts but suffice to say, I won't be buying a 2nd one any time soon."
3,Good for very small area only,It is good if you just do it in a small area. I tried to use it for my back yard and it cover hardly anything. I moved it to my front side yard and have it just to spray a few plants and it works well. This product is only for very small area but has even spray power.
3,Sprinkler,"If you notice there isn't anywhere to tie this in to your faucet. Therefore you will need to either remove on of the sprinkler heads or add a hose. Not a big deal, but worth noting. There are not enough kinds of spouts per each sprinkler head. it comes with one in each head and 2 replacements. It would be nice if you could do directional on all, 360 degrees on all, etc."
2,POORLY MADE,"I had been looking for something that worked like an in ground sprinkler system that could at the same time be hooked to my faucet. Now I can see why this is impractical. No matter how high your water pressure is, the volume of water moving through a garden hose is simply not high enough to power much more than a single sprinkler. If you happen to have a very small yard, this product might work for you, but then so would most any sprinkler. This product is quit cheaply made, and I doubt if it will last long. The amount of water coming out of each head is quite low, and I have great water pressure. I would suggest spending the money on one of the tractor type sprinklers, as at least you can water an entire yard with them if you have the patience to make a track for the sprinkler to run on. This product is definatly a dud in my opinion."
1,"Game Crashes, Impossible to Complete","The game crashes trying to start Chapter 6, complaining about no such ""Resource.m06"" file. There is no resource.m06 file in the resource folder. Thus the game is impossible to complete."
2,Fun until it stopped playing,"Enjoyed the first 5 chapters, but it will not let me play chapter 6. I receive a pop up that says Error:File not found Resource\Resource.M06Maybe when my kids come up for Thanksgiving they can figure it out, but I can't so I am stuck. It reminded me of the Leisure suit Larry games and I was enjoying it up til then."
4,fun characters,"This game is reminiscent of the Monkey Island series by Lucas Arts which is not a bad thing at all. The animation is great and the characters have tons of personality. Game play is pretty fun, I got a little drifty due to lack of challenge. The problem solving is not based on reality logic. You have to use logic according to what you have in your inventory. It's a very short game, I think I logged about 5-7 hours total and like I said, my attention was drifting frequently. Even though it wasn't a huge challenge, it's still a good game for the adventure players. I find games like Syberia way overrated and zero challenge except for the fact that I must finish it so Runaway IS worthwhile. Interesting factoid: the main female voice (a few characters played by her) is also a voice in quite a few games out there...Nancy Drew in particular.I recommend buy it, play it, resell it!"
3,Fun and Frustrating,"Compared to other recent adventure titles, I have to agree with most reviews here that the graphics, sound, and voice acting are top-notch, as are the controls and interface. However, many of the puzzles are completely illogical and take a trial and error approach. In fact, I had to check the walkthough on several occasions after spending hours trying to figure out that item A needs to be combined with item B before using it on item C.Overall, it was enjoyable at first and some of the humor was on-spot (especially the bus full of drag queens), but it lost something when the puzzles became obscure and irrelevant.To the person who complained that the cut-scenes were upside-down, I think you need to get your graphics checked out. The cut-scenes were all normal on my system..."
4,Enjoyable,If you like an unrushed adventure games and time to watch short movies--this is the game. The graphics are fairly good and does have some humor at tmes. Good game support which I feel is important.
2,Monkey Island meets the Sopranos,I really wanted to like this game. The graphics reminded me of the old LucasArts adventure games which I loved. But there's nothing cute or charming about this game. It's full of thugs and killers and the puzzles are too confusing. I gave up on it.
2,most overrated adventure game of last 10 years,if you like puzzles that make no sense and a slow story that drags itself making no sense at all get this game. The hype is absurd. If you like cartoonish graphics go for the abbey or grim fandango instead..
3,"Good game, great graphics, a bit short, needed more polish.","This is a good game, with gorgeous graphics, but it was really simple, and, with the exception of a few puzzles that made no sense and passed through trial & error, it was a lot of fun.The biggest problem is that it's just a tad too short. In some areas, especially at the end, it felt rushed through, like the developers ran out of time and preferred shooting scenes rather than giving you puzzles.A bit bloody and a few dead people, so it's not for young kids, in case anyone wonders."
3,better than most,"This is a better than average adventure game. Major points for point and click ability instead of using arrows and other keyboard letters. It has funny ,politically-incorrect characters, great animation and sense of humor. Where else can you sit around in your sweatpants and be entertained for hours for about 20 bucks?"
5,Don't pay $60 -$100 for a Home Kit! Buy this instead!,"My XM2GO home unit went bad, but I didn't want to spend the $60 to $100 dollars for another unit so I decided to give this a shot instead since the price was so cheap. When I got the product it went WAY beyond my expectations! The docking system appears to be high quality and comes with everything that is included with a regular home unit (antenna, power, etc). I expected the speakers to sound weak, but they really sound great!Even though the speakers ar great, I connect the unit's headphone output to my stereo system and rock the house! In summary, it's an awesome unit at a steal of a price (I paid $15)! I couldn't be happier!"
4,Not bad for what it is,"Having not really looked at the dimensions, I was a little disappointed that the speaker system is about the size of a tissue box. The sound isn't bad at all for the size of it. This unit works nicely for a small office with a window, but if you want the full enjoyment of music in the home, get a docking station for the receiver and hook it up to a home stereo."
2,docking speaker,Ordered the wrong docking station. But plan on getting a new radio so we kept it. Product was well made.
4,Excellent Product,"This is an excellent product for the price. Because of the size of the unit, the speakers fall a little short, but it plays and stills sounds good."
4,"Great product! Full, rich stereo sound for my MyFi!","I read all the reviews before purchasing, and this item is a great deal for the price! The stereo sound is rich and full, and it's great that this also serves as a docking station/recharger for my MyFi. I strongly recommend this item!"
1,Antenna Problem,"The antenna came with the unit did not work. Amazon was great in sending the replacement unit. However, the new antenna was also not working. when I used the antenna that came with the XM2go's kit, it did work both times with the AL's docking bases. Good sound, but limited in volume."
1,Would have been just the thing,"Would have been just the thing if it didn't buzz all the time. XM Radio sounded O.K. For the price I didn't expect super ""Hi-Fi"" quality. But the darn thing had a constant buzz in the back ground. I exchanged it and it was replaced by another with the same problem. Returned that too. All in all I spent better than half the price of the unit on shipping and return shipping and I'm still looking for a speaker-docking system of this type for my Tao. If you find one that doesn't buzz at this price it's not a bad deal. Also you should know, there is no ON/OFF switch or button, it's on all thie time."
4,Nice product for the price,"I purchased this product for my Delphi Myfi XM2GO to replace the non-operational home charging kit that originally came with the Myfi. The Altec Lansing XM3020 is a great alternative to simply replacing the home charging kit, since it was roughly the same price and also provides the added bonus of decent speakers for a small area. The speakers are certainly not over-powering, but provide nice sound for a bedroom or home office. I also like the fact that there is a headphone jack, since I like to listen to XM at night when my wife is sleeping. The unit is also fairly compact, is easy to set-up, and is not visually unappealing.The only feature I think it is missing is a power on/off switch. I find that I need to power off my radio to turn the speakers off.Delphi MyFi XM2GO Portable XM Satellite Radio Receiver with Home / Car KitsAltec Lansing Desktop Speaker System For XM2GO - XM3020"
5,wow,you can not beleave the qaulity of sound this puts out far better than i expected at any price exclenet unit highly recomind it
4,Fits on my desk nicely at work,"I bought this so I could bring my Delphi MyFi xm2go radio into my office and out of my vehicle at work. It has a small footprint on the desk. It was very easy to set up, taking only a couple of minutes (most of that was arranging the included XM antenna). The cradle doubles as a recharger. The sound quality is at least as good as your run-of-the-mill desktop radio unit. It won't satisfy zealous audiophiles, but for the rest of us who just want to listen to some bluegrass or Laura Ingraham while toiling away at our PCs, it more than meets the specs."
1,altec lansing docking station xm3020,"Had good sound, but it broke within 20 minutes as the port for the antenna broke off....very cheap...the unit fell on its side which pulled on the antenna and broke the port...no sound and no way to fix"
4,Surprising Sound from Small Unit,"We've had this unit for about 6 months. Unlike some of the other reviewers our antenna & unit worked perfectly right out of the box. We use this with a Pioneer Airware. The sound is nicely balanced & tight. It's not a booming bassbox nor is it intended to be. We use our Airware virtually 24 hours a day; I use the XM3020 all day in the office. It gives pleasant, quality sound at a very reasonable price. Would recommend."
3,Take the good with the bad,"The speakers in this unit are weak. Using it as an in home dock that plugs into your stereo or receiver is much better.The antenna in mine was broken and barely picked up. I went through placing it on my roof before I realized it just wasn't going to work. Luckily I had a backup antenna and other xm antennas will hook up to it just fine.Lastly, I don't have a MyFi, AirWare or Tao. However, the dock connector for xm radios seems to be universal. So I was actually able to dremel away the plastic casing until I had this thing working as a dock for my RoadyXT(You'll notice a nearly identical docking unit for the Roady for sale at a higher price from Altec Lansing). It works perfectly for that and I couldn't be happier.Still though, I give it a average 3 star review for the broken antenna."
3,Worked beautifully while it lasted,"I bought this as a Christmas gift for a friend. He loved it, and it worked very well for about four months. After that, it developed an annoying high-pitched whine. About a month after the whine started, it would stop working for no obvious reason, and then start up again. He hadn't kept the packaging, so I wasn't able to return it."
2,My first one was better,"This is the second Altec Lansing docking station I have purchased. The first one works great, but with this one you really have to mess with it to get a signal."
4,A great solution for my XM radio,"This is a great solution for catching baseball games when not in the car. And I finally have a use for the remote control!Please note that the remote control is not included with the speaker system, and the speaker system's AC adapter is needed at all times.The audio quality is completely acceptable considering this is a satellite radio."
5,Altec Lansing XM3020 Docking Speaker System,"This sytem is a great option for listening to my Myfi XM receiver. Mind you, it's not a Bose Wave system sound, but for the money, it puts out pretty good sound, good bass. And it doubles as a charging station too. IMO, better than some boom boxes."
5,-Editor's Note-,"Nothing in the background of Colin Taylor, a serious young black singer studying for a career in opera, could have prepared him for meeting and falling in love with Ave Blue, a street-smart single mother whose personal agenda includes revenge upon two notorious police detectives, tried--but exonerated--in the shooting death of Ave's older brother Tamar, a suspected criminal.In Stephen Burrell's noir novel of inner-city Boston in 1971, incendiary relationships propel the action, and as the settings shift from bedroom to family room to courtroom, the denouement erupts in a cause celebre that shakes presumptions of guilt and innocence.A story of obsession, self-sacrifice, and ultimate redemption, this novel can speak to any reader imparting something significant and valuable."
2,disappointed.,"Important subject matter, but very biased treatment of the way the case was conducted. Author fails to understand the role played by the Legal Aid Society in the conduct of the case, and in the overall representation of juveniles in New York."
2,Frustrating read,"Just because it's non fiction doesn't mean I can't use my imagination. What made Nina Bernstein think I'd be interested in the exact height, hometown and family tree of every person associated with the Wilder case?The book is written as a narrative which bounces around from one person to another multiple times within chapters which is extremely frustrating. Just as you are getting interested in the story or the course of events she does a quick change to some other character, some of which are not at all interesting. This style is often enjoyable, (mostly in non fiction) but this is not a good application of that method.Aside from my overall frustration with the book it is of course still compelling material. Reading it just feels like wading through a swamp of details.Unfortunately, this book could have easily been half as long and twice as compelling."
2,Life's a beach when your career is on the rocks.,"By 1978, these once-proud pioneering progressive rockers had sunk so low that they actually stood on the cover with their shirts open - trying to look studly, no doubt - and had the gall to title the album Love Beach. This would be hilarious, if not for the fact that these were the same guys who once created such progressive rock masterpieces as Tarkus and Trilogy. Side one is totally forgettable, and though side two's Memoirs Of An Officer And A Gentleman suite has its moments, the material is too weak overall to sustain any musical or emotional momentum. It ends with a whimper - a ""march"" that comes off as a lame echo of Abbadon's Bolero (from Trilogy). Emerson ditched the Hammond organ in favor of the thin-sounding polyphonic synthesizer - a terrible mistake. What a sad, pathetic way to end a great artistic career."
2,Even Keith hates this album,"We must remember that when Love Beach came out Keith Emerson wrote an open letter in ""Keyboard"" magazine apologizing for this album. This is the album that broke the group up for years. 'nuff said"
1,THE GREATEST DARTBOARD EVER RECORDED,"Possibly one the worst and most radical carrer moves in rock HISTORY!!! Did some record executive hold a gun to their heads and force them to do this? Did they actually think it would sell? There is a bit of good material on side 2, but the only use for this album is to serve as a hilariously great example of how to ruin a career. POUR THE MARTINIS! BRING IN THE BEACH BUNNIES! GET THE DARTS!!!"
3,No love on this beach,"For a huge ELP fan, this was a huge dissappointment. The talent is there, but the cohesiveness, the tight sound, and the beautiful melodies are lacking. It almost reminds me of a band trying to find its way; and in this case, it was at a point where the boys were trying to find their way apart. It has redeeming qualities like the unmatchable talent of Keith Emerson and is worth a listen for the ELP fan, but does not rate with the earlier work in the least. I would grade this a C."
1,EVERYTHING FAILED HERE>..,"Ridiculous cover artwork, ridiculous lyrics, absurdly ibad compositions, onc you take account of who's writing them: gifted and talented musicians. A pure waste, showing how they finished, having totally lost their focus."
2,"Not as awful as it's made to be, but still ...","Ugh... Well, if we remember that by nature, Greg Lake was a popsongwriter, the decision to record songs of this nature in 1978doesn't seem as shocking. Plus, some of the melodies are quite interesting - All I Want is You is excellent, and the title track, The Gambler, and For You are all decent. Alas, all are marred by Emerson's work, which is at best hopelessly generic and at worst annoying as hell. And, of course, you have Memoirs, quite possibly the worst 'epic' track I've ever heard (and I've heard my share). Still, there are enough tasty bits on side one to keep it from total failure"
3,Not as bad as some would present,"Sure, the first side of album with all its little 3 minute songs sounds like ELP was trying desperately to put out some product to appease the program directors for AOR and A.M. radio stations across the land, but if you look beyond those sappy, insipid tunes you will find the true value of this recording. ""Canario"" is an uplifting song that reminds the listener that the boys still knew how to update a classical piece for the modern age, and in this case, does it with a smile that practically jumps off the record. ""Memoirs..."" is a wonderful piece of music that is hard to describe, but, easy to enjoy. True, it is a bit dramatic and even a bit sappy at times, but, it does convey the romantic ideals of being an officer and of being in love. LB is not the definitive ELP album, but, it has its moments and belongs in the collection of anyone who would proclaim themselves an ELP fan."
1,Horrible,"This album marked the demise of one of my favorite rock groups of all time. If you like the group, stay away from this trash."
1,Sorry but everyone is right about this one,"I hadnt heard this album in years and then found a CD at a used record store and I remembered one song that I kind of liked so I went ahead and bought Love Beach again.Album really sucks...............the one song I liked was ""Canario"" and still do - but the rest of it is pretty awful.Memoirs of an officer and a gentleman??????????I think Greg wrote all these songs in one afternoon and Keith is just making stuff up as he is recording the album is my guess.And if thats the truth then it could have been worse. Maybe.......or maybe this is as bad as it can get for these guys.The ""Live"" album that followed Love Beach was just as bad............I think they started losing their footing with ""Brain Salad Surgery"" - then ""Works"" then ""Works II"". By the time of ""Love Beach"" these guys had had it.If you find Love Beach in the 99cent rack go ahead and try it out - you'll still think you got ripped offlike I said........sorry guys"
2,Music is okay; The cover is unforgivable,"This is not the album to start with if your just discovering ELP. In fact, unless your just trying to rounding out your ELP collection I'd stay away from this album at all costs."
1,HELP,"Yes, they should have hired the Hoff himself and named the band HELP. What with the success of David Hasslehoff in Europe, Love Beach could been the biggest thing in Belgium with this record if only the Mighty Hoff had joined them. This is just further reminder that the 70's which began with such great music, ended with a great big collective hurl."
3,Either you'll love it or hate it.,"But to be strictly honest, any EL&P fan will throw this album away doubtless.It is definitely NOT a representative of the immense creative work of that early seventies power trio.But nonetheless, this is not a bad album either. Just give a listen to it, and judge for yourself. Memoirs Of an Officer and a Gentleman is a nice work, and Canario sounds really great, confirming Emerson as an experienced classical music arranger."
2,All Dried Up?,"Alas, there's not much love at this beach. Precious little strong material, either. If you're new to the group, start with their early 70's recordings instead."
2,Stick with the first four releases,"This is one of those necessary releases that record companies require to complete a band's obligations. Even at that, three or four of the individual tracks are good and sound like short prose of ELP's more majestic and grand themes but overall it is difficult to overcome the lack of cohesiveness in the format and the overbearing tribute to some great lost love. Everything after the vicious keyboard assault in ""Canario"", the ""Memoirs..."" suite, is totally dispensable. No one listens to ELP to endure sappy drawn out ballad-like tales which read like a third-rate romance novel."
1,Please...just shoot me!,"I have loved all the ELP albums from their debute till this thing. I've tried many times to listen to it and try to grasp what they were trying to do here but to no avail. I bought the album (at a discount store around 1980)and recorded it to, would you believe, 8-track. I tried to listen to it in my car, my home, wherever, but just couldn't tolerate it. I had to go back and listen to Trilogy or Tarkus to still remain loyal to the group. If I ever place it on my still operable turntable to 'test it out' just one more time, just shoot me. What a piece of junk. It only get one star 'cause I could go any lower. Don't waste your money."
4,I always liked this record...,"Of all the ELP records I had on vinyl back in the day (and I had them all save Works II and In Concert), this is the only one I've cared to buy on CD, much less listen to in 2008.Why?1) The band play exceptionally well;2) the songs are well-written, concise and accessible;3) this has the most modern, coherent ""sound"" of any of their 70s albums, at least to my ears;4) Greg Lake's vocals sound fresh and clear, like they were recorded yesterday...Also, I just dig side II and Pete Sinfield's lyrics as well.Even when they were supposedly ""phoning it in"", they produced a record 80% of bands wish they could produce with maximum effort."
1,Stomach-turningly bad.,"Cripes, look at the cover! If that's not indicative of the album's quality, there's only one fact you need to know. The group only released this album because they owed it to their original record label. Still not convinced? Well, there's not much else to say, except that this atrocious record brings me dangerously close to vomiting whenever it plays. Hardcore ELP fans shouldn't even buy this to finish their collection. Stay far away from it. Keep other people away from it. Wear a big sign and stand in front of record stores. Save us all!"
4,Officer and a Gentleman makes this a 4 star record,"In retrospect, this is a good ELP record. Amhet needed a hit or he would drop the band from Atlantic records so they tried to make a pop album and they did a halfway decent job for prog rockers. Officer and a Gentleman suite is on the same level as Pirates and should not be overlooked."
2,What were they thinking?,"ELP are one of my favorite bands, but even I don't have to like this contractual-obligation quickie taped between tanning sessions in the Bahamas. Pete Sinfield's lyrics are good for a laugh, at least, but the biggest one is the front cover photo--did these guys really think they were sex symbols? (It is instructive that Carl Palmer, always the most circumspect member of the group, posed with his shirt buttoned.) It's not all awful--""Canario"" is actually one of ELP's more respectful covers of a classical piece--but ""Brain Salad Surgery"" or ""Tarkus"" cut it to ribbons."
5,"Actually, quite good","Love Beach got a lot of negative reviews from ELP purists.....In the end, nice pop music."
2,The worst ELP album: stay away from it!,"OK, I have a copy of every ELP album there is. I used to own this one, but I sold it. That's how bad it is. OK? Just to provide some perspective, it was recorded as a result of their label's pressure to put out another record, although their interest at the time was to take a few years off and pursue solo projects. The result was ""a disjointed, uninspired collection of songs released in mid 1979"" (quote from the band's official web site) and the break-up of ELP for 12 years.There's lots of great ELP material but this. Go get yourself a different ELP album, and do yourself a favor."
2,Emerson Lake & Palmer - 'Love Beach' (Rhino),"Originally released in late 1978 solely because they owed one more album to their label,Atlantic.'Love Beach' was the last ELP effort until they reunited fourteen years later for 'Black Moon'.This is my least desired CD by the trio.Two cuts that I thought were so-so are ""All I Want Is You"" and the 24-minute somewhat dramatic ""Memos Of An Officer And A Gentleman"" which details the tale of a WWII soldier.A bit lengthy,for what the epic develops into.Pretty much for Emerson Lake&Palmer die-hard fans."
5,Excellent!,"Excellent, every dog owner should have this! Entire series is wonderful!Highly recommend!"
4,Liz Sport perfume,I love this perfume. In my area it is very difficult to find at a department store. My only problem was that I was sent 2 bottles when I ordered only one. This seems to be a problem. In the past I have been sent the wrong items.
2,Not easy,I agree with other review & i paid over 100 dollars for this bit with same results you would have to make joints then run through planer or jointer to line up very un happy sitting on my shelf collecting dust
5,In pure terms historical significance this is a very interesting book!,Rossi really out did himself on this one. I'm a big reader of Erickson's work but I never expected that something like this would be published. It's so interesting view Milton's correspondences. This is him at his most candid. You get to see him converse with many big names from the field of psychology during his day. You can even see his concerns regarding the American Society of Clinical Hypnosis. I never thought that someone like him would be so concerned about the internal politics of the organization.If you are fan of Erickson this is once again a definite MUST read!
2,Children's Magnets,"The magnets are pretty weak, which is probably safer for little ones. Many will not support their own weight on the refridgerator. Made of a cast metal that is very brittle and breaks easily. We broke 2 in the first 3 days. Still, my kid loves pushing around one magnet with another, so I guess it was an acceptable purchase. I would try another set."
2,Magnet Set,"Almost all the magnets broke in one day. My students are not rough on stuff but they did drop them, but just onto the table tops !The magnetism was very weak!"
2,cheap but not very strong,this is a cheap set...picked up for classroom use but it is not very strong.
1,some magnet pole labels are wrong,"I ordered this product a few days ago and got it yesterday. However, when I use it do an experiment with my kids, I found that some pieces labeled incorrectly. Since the ""N"" pole will attract another piece's ""N"" pole together. I don't know what to explain to my kids. :("
3,Small Magnets,"My mom bought this for my 5 year old son, who loves playing with magnets. I was very surprised for how small all the magnets are. Though they work well with one another, it just wasn't what I pictured in my head that the product was going to be."
1,Deceptive,"The magnets are basically large plastic cases designed to look like significant magnets. In reality, these are nothing more than plastic shells with a tiny magnet placed into the plastic. The actual magnet is pretty much a joke, along the lines of a refrigerator magnet and not what I was expecting. Not recommended."
1,Worst product ever...,"These are not magnets at all, they are plastic peaces which have very small.... extremely lousy small magnets placed in them. Forget sticking them to the fridge or some iron surface... you are lucky if they stick to each other. They are that bad... I would not even buy them if someone would pay me 10 bucks. Very unhappy with this purchase.."
1,Complete piece of trash,"I usually check the reviews of items before I purchase them and for some reason did not when I ordered these ""magnets"" to use as part of a series of homeschool science lessons; if I had I would not have ordered them. These are not usable magnets to observe anything about magnetism and even as toys are cheaply made. All of them are simply small magnets encased in plastic and most actually contain more than one magnet. If I could give ZERO stars I would."
1,Poor and plastic.,Plastic covering. The magnetic kids' letters on our fridge have stronger magnets. Weak magnets. Poles not labeled properly. Don't buy it.
1,The magnets simply dont work.,They are plastic with magnets inside the plastic. They cannot even support their own weight when placed on a fridge. Total garbage. This company and amazon should be ashamed.
1,Do not order...,"Ordered this for a 2yr old who has discovered magnets & is excited about them . 2 adults & 1 child opened this pkg. The magnets are plastic coated and do not stick to each other much less anything else. The disappointment for the child was sad, no fun and no learning experience from this product. Needs to be eliminatedMagnets and more 24 piece set by toysmithtotally ... junk."
2,BEWARE! Plastic Casings!!!,"Like all the others said, these are tiny magnets enclosed in large plastic cases. My kids had some fun with it but only for a short time. Then they started complaining that they don't have much power. It may be more expensive to make that size magnets, but the manufacturer at least should have included more powerful magnets. Some of the pieces have such little power, it's a shame you call them magnets!"
1,Not terribly helpful,"I purchased this as a last resort after reading and trying everything I could online. My son has an SPD, so has much in common with chilren on the Autism spectrum. I hope the book would offer a new perspective. Unfortunately it was simply a basic toilet training guide with the occasional reminder that special needs children require additional time and support with toileting. For me, there were no new insights/ideas at all."
2,Redundant,"Both my husband and I read this book. I can sum it up for you right here for free: use pictures. Every chapter has numerous personal anectdoes about how the author had some kid that wasn't potty trained and then they used picures and miraculously they were potty trained in no time at all. Drink some Red Bull to stay awake. This theme repeated over and over and over. Plan B: Familiarize yourself with PECS (picutre exchange communication system) or I just printed out some clip art. Either way it didn't work. My son just decided one day he wanted to wear underwear and be potty trained. (Just like our elders told us would happen.) If you really want this book, I have one for a really good price ;)"
4,VERY GOOD INFO,"Haven't finish the book yet, but so far I'm getting very good information that can help me potty train my lil one with ASD"
4,of course,"there's not usually a ton of difference between toilet training typically developing children and those with developmental delays or autism, but when there is it makes a difference. great to have a resource. i'm a behavior consultant who works with kids on the spectrum, and this guide will help you"
3,Toilet Training Not Easy,"As I am writing this review I am reminded of the many hours and hopeful attempts to try to train my ASD son. He was in a theraputic preschool program the first time I purchased this book and then the second time was last summer. I knew many of the things from past IEPs and Assessments. Picture Schedules worked for us however if you have never had a picture schedule or set up a routine for teaching something new this book would help if you are skip it. This book did not help us however time did and then a good routine that was established across all settings, home, school, and community. We finally did it and you will too! Good Luck!"
5,Partners In Autisms Organization - Intervention Book Pick,"Much more than a how-to, this book adeptly tackles one of the least talked about yet most universal and stress inducing problems facing parents and caregivers of children with Autistic Spectrum Disorders. Much of the methodology and tactics introduced are logically derived from a number of case studies where various sensory and developmental issues that often impede mastery and retention of toileting skills were addressed."
1,Sometimes they just need time,I tried this book and it's methods when my son was 4 hoping to get him trained as his twin was already trained (twin is not autistic) but really it came down to he just needed more time. Now at age 6 without the help of books he is trained as well. He just needed time to get it for himself.
5,"Very funny, good book for those who love Hollywood...","I always enjoy a good book that takes place in the trenches of Hollywood. This novel was well written, funny and the story line and sub plots kept my interest from beginning to end.I highly recommend this book if you are interested in seeing Hollywood from an assistants point of view."
1,Booooooring,"I had a hard time getting into this incredibly wordy and dull book...it was far-fetched, lacking in humor and/or wit, and the characters weren't very well developed."
5,Fun summer read,"I loved this book, it was extremely entertaining. i found myself laughing out-loud through out the novel. it was an easy read, very quick... especially because you will want to keep reading it. i would recommend this book very highly, it is a great beach book!"
5,I loved this book,"I can't remember the last time I've had so much fun reading a book. I laughed a lot, loved the characters and since I worked in the entertainment industry for years I could relate to the characters. If you're a fan of The Devil Wears Prada or any of those type of books I think you'll enjoy this chick-lit book. I rarely read this kind of book but something told me to buy it when I went to Target for some book browsing and I'm so glad that I did. No this is not some literary masterpiece that will win Nobel prizes but it wasn't intended to be anything but fun. Everytime I had to put the book down, I couldn't wait to get a chance to pick it right up and find out what was going to happen next to Lizzie. The ending has some interesting twists that I didn't see coming and although it was a typical ""wrap-a-bow-around"" the ending type of Hollywood ending I still enjoyed it. It's a great summer read and I look forward to reading more from these authors -- Jeff Rivera [...]"
4,Great insight to Hollywood Biz,"This book is hysterical. After being a second assistant in Hollywood myself, I can say all the good, bad, crazy and hysterical situations really do happen! This is a fun summer read."
2,It took two people to write this??,"Perhaps this book is written so conventionally, so sophmorically and so uninspiringly is BECAUSE it was a collaborative effort. I think one writer would have found a more interesting voice than that of this sterotypical nice girl in the big city."
3,Beach read,"This book is good for a beach read or something along those lines. I read it a week ago and already most of it is pretty vague in my head. Except for one completely unexpected scene (in a movie theater) that remains pretty vivid in my head. Rather ickily so.It flows pretty quickly though it seems to slow pace a little half way though as the main character is finding her niche a little bit more.Several famous characters make visits in the pages, in very caricture-ish light. Certainly not a book I need to read more than once."
5,LA and Hollywood are evil - but fun to laugh at!,Fabulously entertaining read. Not just chick lit. Deliciously written. Tells many stories that needed to be told and left me giggling away. And the authors are really hot!
3,"Cute, but not my favorite!","I bought this book based on the good reviews it received. I also thought it sounded like it would be a lot like The Devil Wears Prada. As an assistant myself, I enjoy hearing other people trash their jobs and go through similar situations that I often do.I was disappointed in The Second Assistant. It's less about actually being an assistant and more about her life in Hollywood. She was very naive and never seemed to catch through the entire book.It is a cute book and I read it quickly, but just found the characters a bit shallower then I would have hoped..."
2,Mildly entertaining...,"Yes, the book and especially the heroine is quite annoying!Elizabeth (couldn't they think of a more popular name?!), is toooo naive, tooo obscure (probably so that everyone could identify with her), and the storyline is tooo unbelievable! Especially when it comes to men... Toads, toads, toads... TA DA! A prince! Please!!! Very ""chick lit"" in the worst possible sense...Honestly, the authors didn't do a very good job. It seems like they sat for a round of ""margaritas"" and thought up this book in one evening... What a way to make some easy cash...Definitely, not worth buying..."
3,"A fun, quick read","Yeah, the subject is a retread for Nanny Diaries and Devil Wears Prada folks, but I felt Second Assistant was different because the authors were better writers. Some of the passages were really well written and I appreciated it. Not looking for a sequel but I enjoy this genre."
2,Shallow dimwits bible,"I'm normally a huge fan of shallow, fun reads (like Prada, Nanny Diaries,etc) but this book was lame and you figure out what's going to happen within the first few chapters of the book. The lead character wasn't appealing..on her first big event, she goes topless in her boss' pool...and then claims Hollywood is weird? Hello?! Try Right Address, or True and Fab Adventures of the Hunt Sisters instead."
3,About Average,"This book has me a bit confused on how I feel. It started off very quickly, dumping you right into the life of Elizabeth Miller, second assistant to a huge Hollywood agent. There really wasn't much set up or character building, but after a few chapters, I really began to get into Elizabeth's life. She met celebrities daily and planned huge Hollywood parties, attended premiers and was asked out by some of the most powerful men in the world. It turns out her ambition, after giving up a life in politics, is to become a producer on an indie script she feels passionate about.She learns her way through the industry and makes some excellent contacts, some a little more personal than others. The story has a great plot but comes to such a quick and abrupt ending, which is a little disappointing. But it implies there will be a sequel - which I will most likely be reading as well. :)"
2,Being A Tad Generous With 2.5 Stars...,"I don't know what to really say about this book. I'm a big fan of chick lit that dishes about the entertainment industry but the genre as a whole is becoming very stale. This book doesn't help bring in new fans. It was way too long and drawn out, the storyline was all over the place, and the pieces just didn't fit. You know how you're completing a jigsaw puzzle and you're down to the last few pieces and you try to make them fit? That's sorta what this book is like.I still give the book a generous 2.5 stars because I liked the subject matter, just not the way it was written overall. I even smiled at the ending, but that could have been because I actually finished the book and not because it was clever. In my opinion, hardcover book money is too hard to come by so utilize your tax dollars and check this out of your local library."
3,Would be better without flaws,"When following lessons to the letter I found that some of the results expected are not achieved due to the book differing from the actual sample files on the accompanying CD. Truly these are errors in publication (I found similar errors in the Photoshop Classroom In A Book and got those confirmed by Adobe and the book publisher).Publishing an instructional guide with errors is quite frustrating when wanting to take the time to learn the product. I don't know if they corrected these in the 2.0 release, just be forewarned...."
5,Works great,"Thank you for providing this item! I was irked to learn that the back windshield wiper for my Chevy Traverse is ""only available at the dealer"" which I think it nuts. So, I went to the internet for help. This wiper fits and works perfectly on my back windshield and I am sure it cost me a fraction of what the dealer would have charged. thank you!"
2,If it doesn't fit?,The wiper blade does not fit the vehicle application that the site recommends for the wiper blade(Infinity QX56-rear window). Perhaps I can use it as a shower squeegee.
2,Two stars for misleading information on Amazon template,"Even though I verified this would fit my 2006 Hyundai Tuscon, it did not work. I tried installing it myself and then I took it to the service department. I found out my rear window wiper is considered after market and is not available without ordering it from Hyundai directly. Hence, the two stars. Be careful with Amazon's template. It's not accurate.The product looks sturdy and even so - like the previous review, electric tape is necessary to keep it on. I ended up ordering my wiper from Hyundai for $1 more."
4,Good OEM replacement for my vehicle.,So far so good. Seems to be a good quality constructed wiper and works great! Direct replacement for OEM version for my vehicle.
5,Mrs. Jeffries is at the top of her game!,"This is one of the better Mrs. Jeffries books. The plot is a little more complex than some of the preceeding books. When an unidentified lady is found stabbed to death in a locked communal garden, Mrs. Jeffries and her crew are launched into investigating one of the most confusing cases yet. The ending for this one is a bit of a surprise as well. And we see Bestsy and her Smythe reach another level in their ""courting"". Same great characters, same cozy atmosphere - What else could you ask for?"
3,Not the Best,"Basically, I enjoy reading all the Mrs. Jeffries' books but this one did not hold my interest as much as some of the others. I really like the regular characters in the Jeffries' series; Wiggins, Betsy, Mrs. Goodge, Smythe, Detective Witherspoon and, of course, Mrs. Jeffries. I just feel it was a weak plot and just not as interesting as some of others in the series. However, if you are like me, I enjoy these simple mysteries by Emily Brightwell and want to read all of them."
2,Garment bag not too good,I guess I expected something more than a cheap plastic bag which you usually get when purchasing a mens suit. It certainly isn't worth the $21.00 cost.
1,garment cover,this is not what I was expecting especially form American Touristeryou could never use it as check-in luggage on a planeI would use it for car trips or to hang in a closet
3,Runaway Latkes,The book is ok-good but the time it took to arrive seemed much longer than other products that I have ordered in the past from Amazon.
1,Poor Quality,"The fruit arrived in a timely fashion, but much of the fruit was not ripe, and quality was very poor. Most of the fruit delivered was fruit easily obtainable at most grovery stores for a fraction of what was charged for this basket. Don't waste your money!"
5,Very Helpful,"For a bride that doesn't have a clue as to where to begin, what to do, who to trust; the authors of Bridal Bargains have done a great job with creating this planner. I couldn't find the most up to date one but this one has worked great thus far. I'm one to organize and stay focused and this does exactly that. EXTREMELY satisfied with my purchase and the seller described it exactly as it was :)"
1,This was a low blow CD - expected much more.,Can't hear it. Where is the sound? How odd. I don't like the sound at all. This is NOT R&B.; I kinda want my money back. I thought this band was great live but this CD sounds terrible.The thing that is cool about the singer is she plays WoW and dedicates a thank you to WoW!
1,What a waste of money!,"This was a waste of my money. This production is terrible it is not worth $10. I think the singer is good but the cover looked like it was produced on crappy paper and this was a new copy I ordered!Then I heard the songs.. the songs themselves could probably be good if you could hear them, but the sound is terrible. It sounds like it was produced in a garage with crackheads at the helm. I could get better sound listening to a podcast from Bali. Ugh, I actually threw out the CD.Don't waste your money on this one. There are so many great CD's on Amazon! Thanks for heeding my disaster! LOL"
5,Works Great!,"Man this tool works great! My car restoration hobby has expanded to include more sheet metal repair work, so having a mini sawz-all is a must. You can pay more, or less for such a tool, but for my needs the I-R 429 works great (Mr. Diana)."
5,Great saw,I purchased this saw to cut the sheetmetal in the trunk of a classic car and it works flawlessly. It will cut double layers of 18 ga. metal and make tight turns in the corner. It's great.
1,HORRIBLE PRODUCT HORRIBLE SERVICE,"HORRIBLE SERVICE AND PRODUCT. After the company taking the money out of the account then placing it back in only to once again take it out, the product stinks! I never got a conformation email or tracking number and the product sizes lie to you. I wouldn't tell anyone to buy it. They're lucky I even gave it one star."
3,nice briefer but back cut too low!,loved the briefer but i felt back was cut too low so thus my backfat (ugh) came spilling out.would be perfect had they cut the back straight across....mthe bust part runs small too! the rest is nice. i ordered a 36d my bra size..
4,good but not without flaws,"The Bridge Book is a solid and highly readable introduction to playing bridge. The strengths of the book include its low price, clear lessons, and many quizzes that allow you to test your comprehension of the material. This is one of the most accessible bridge books I've ever seen. The flaws, however, include a rather clumsy organization of chapters, a small number of less than clear explanations, and a somewhat out-of-date approach. The book was written almost two decades ago and still recommends opening 1 NT with 16-18 points, as opposed to the more modern (but not universally accepted) 15-17 points. These are minor flaws though, and if you tend to play with people who learned the game a number of years ago, The Bridge Book would be a good place to start learning."
3,so-so for people like me. solid gold for theory based students though.,"it's well worth the price, ON AMAZON, not in your local school bookstore or barnes and noble.that's all i really have to say. screw music theory."
5,Best book for advanced music theory and composition,"This is a MUST READ for any composer, university music student or musician looking for insight on advanced music theory."
5,The best ELP album ever,"A one of 10 albums you would take to a deserted island. A true masterpiece which shows, to my opinion, the superiority of live concerts. The energy and skill with the ultimate combination of classical music with jazz-rock make you long for those long lost days."
5,A Must for any ELP Fan,"To many, this is the definative ELP Live album. The selection of song titles takes the listener through most of the early hits, and it is most enjoyable. Karl Palmer has quite a few show stopping percussion performances, as well as Keith Emerson, and Greg Lake. A Must buy!!!"
2,Sprawling bombast,"For the most part this album is alright, but it does contain a good dose of ELP's trademark overblown pretension. What really hurts this albums rating is the horrific recording quality. The piano sounds passible but everything else sounds like it was recorded with mics in the back of the auditorium. Lake's vocals are all but buried in the mix. No amount of remastering can fix that. I get the feeling a remix may not do much either. This is for someone who can overlook the the sound issues and must absolutely have every ELP release."
4,"Buy this for the Tarkus medley, if nothing else!","When this came out, it was a monster, just as the 'Yessongs' triple-LP had been in '73. Some sides of the album got much more worn than others. The real gem is the rendition of 'Tarkus', which the band had been playing as a concert for three years by this time. It had evolved to a point where it was a substantially different piece of music. Greg Lake's voice had never sounded more soulful. His insertion of the Crimson lyrics from 'Epitaph' were one of the albums many high points.I much prefer this album to Yessongs. I'll accept that there were no post-concert overdubs done. It is extraordinary how much a three-man combo could achieve live. This album is perhaps ELP's greatest testament."
2,The sound of six hands wanking,"My first rock concert was seeing Emerson, Lake and Palmer in Pullman, Washington in 1974, and I used to love this album as 3 LP's on vinyl. But listening to it now, it's hard to take, and comes across as extraordinarily self-indulgent. Some of the songs (""Toccata,"" for example) might be interesting today if covered by an industrial band, and others sound hilariously like Devo in their primitive synth noodlings. Still, this is nicely recorded, and an accurate time capsule of the age when prog rock ruled the world. And remember, punk rock was spawned in part as a reaction to exactly this sort of masturbatory, self-important excess."
2,Unbelievable Is The Word,"Music such as this prompted the rise of New Wave. While this has its good moments, on the whole, it feels as pretentious and as self-absorbed as anything else in their catalog. Save your money for something else."
1,Hmmmm...,"Let's see...Emerson, Lake, and Palmer release this triple live album in 1974.The Ramones, the world's first punk band, form in 1974.Coincidence?I DON'T THINK SO!!!!!"
5,ELP- they never really left,"This is THE definitive ELP album. Three of the best musicians around giving performances that boggle the mind. I'm astounded at the complexity of the music on this album. I've heard them live a couple of times, and this album more than does their live performances justice. Buy it. If you like ELP, you won't be disappointed."
1,This is a white light not a warm light.,"EDIT: This was a great bulb till it died a month later. I contacted the manufacturer and they stated they can not warranty the bulb, in spite of it stating a 2 Year Warranty on the package. They said I have to go through Amazon. Amazon states I can no longer return the bulbs.DO NOT BUY!I have found that these lights are pretty amazing. It meets the specs on the bulb. It uses very little electricity. It is a non-glare. The light is in the white spectrum, not the normal warm color of a floodlight.Problems that happen when people use these:1. They want a warm glow, like you would find in an incandescent.2. They want a bulb that pumps out the same amount of light, so they can't look at it like a normal bulb.I am using these bulbs in my kitchen. I am very happy as I replace the old incandescent bulbs. They do not seem as bright, but if you measure them with a light meter, it is labeled correctly."
4,good white light but early model didn't last,"This is the only true white light I can find for par 20 light cams. plus very low energy use. light is dim but good enough for kitchen when not cooking. Only problem is bulbs don't last - burned out in months of part time use when should have lasted for years. Much better buy at $9 than they were at $24. Amazon refunded/replaced my first 3 no questions asked. However, by now I hope technology has gotten better. Also, since I know they can burnout, I feel I'm on my own."
2,"Great idea, but poor execution",Who wouldn't want a bulb that was the ultimate in energy efficiency that lasts virtually forever? Sounds too good to be true? It is. This bulb is so dim that it just can't be used as a replacement for a normal PAR 20. Maybe someday LEDs will improve sufficiently to make the promise live up to the expectation.
2,Short life span,"I have to agree with those who've found the bulb does not live up to the glowing, green promises of a long-lived economical bulb. I bought two at COSTCO and got a letter from COSTCO a month or so later warning that the manufacturer had changed its guarantee about hours of use. [My COSTCO doesn't have them any longer] As I'd already tossed my receipt and the bulbs seemed to be working for me, I decided to keep them. One is actually still working more than 6 months later over my stairs where it's on about 5 hours a night. The other one did what others have complained about - half the LEDs started flashing, making it impossible to use. I didn't keep it in long enough to see how long before it went dead."
2,Bulb burned out very quickly,This bulb burned out very quickly in a few days. I returned it for a refund.
1,Light is too cool (blue),"I have just purchased and compared a variety of par20 LED lights and found this bulb to be way, way too blueish. My 2 year old thought it was fun but being under this light makes adults feel like their are in a fun house or something. UltimateBulb's 36 LED warm light Par20 bulb is far superior."
4,Not bad.,I bought 1 to test since a different type w/o the protective outer cover caused moisture from teh kitchen & bathroom to short out 2 bulbs.it has worked beautifully thus I bought another one. It may be age or something else but both bulbs are different lumination tones. The first one is sort of an amber like off white & the new one is ice lightening white.Not quite sure what exactly to make of that but I must say that these suckers do in fact work.I just got 2 more in the mail for the kitchen & can't wait to screw them in!The electric bill has dropped so much that it wouldn't surprise me if it costs the electric company more money to process & send the monthly bill in teh mail than the amount of money they actually get from me. Lol!!!
2,Short Life Span,I used this bulb evenings only for less than two years before it completely failed. This is not an acceptable lifespan for an LED bulb.
3,bathroom reader... not a novel,"I typically try to give most of the McSweeney's books a try. Lets just face it-- they're usually either hit or miss. Facts of Winter is in a no way something to read in large sittings. I tried this and found myself bored within a few pages. Don't get me wrong, though. There's some great stuff in this book. I suggest sticking it in your bathroom or on your night stand and reading an excerpt or two at a time."
3,basketball clock,"The clock is nice in the fact that it displys the time on the ceiling for easy viewing at night, but the alarm is hard to figure out and turning it off the way the instruction manual indicates doesn't always work."
3,Barebones Handel,"Christopher Hogwood's biography of Handel is a good starting place for readers who want to know the basics. The main events of Handel's life are set forth clearly and judiciously, as in the Grove Dictionary, and Hogwood makes sensible judgments about the music, something he is in an excellnt position to do. On the other hand, not much emerges about Handel the man and the milieu in which he lived and worked. Handel was a fascinating and complex character and the epoch in which he lived was in many ways the apex of a way of life that began to change radically not long after his demise. Some studies have appeared, but the synthesis is not there yet. Perhaps Hogwood should write another volume."
3,Works OK,"Unfortunately this device causes horizontal banding, essentially degrading the quality of the image. Now I'm looking for a higher quality device or considering switching everything out to DVI or HDMI instead."
5,"HO Rustic Fence & Gate, 72""","ThisHO Rustic Fence & Gate, 72"" that I purchased through Amazon, is ideal for my model railroad layout and adds realism to my buildings on it"
3,Not an Instructional DVD,Boy this DVD was a real letdown in the sense that it was great to watch Buddy Guy Play but.....There was nothing to learn from it.I wanted to see the licks that inspired a young Jimmi Hendrix to play like he did.Not once on this dvd did Buddy show any usefull lead runs or turnarounds other than standard technique.The stories he told while playing were fun to listen to but there was not enough solid playing tech to back it.This could have been a great DVD if there were Direction to his playing.
2,Now I'm singing the blues,"After reading other reviews of this DVD, I was looking forward to something I could really learn something from. I was mistaken. I've played guitar for 30 years and was wanting to add to my blues licks, but Buddy in this video doesn't play very well, and he doesn't even explain much about his technique, or his thinking about how he goes about it. I was a bit disappointed and wished I could return it."
2,Buddy Guy: Teaching the Blues,"The product description for this ""instructional"" DVD is very deceiving. I am an avid blues guitarist and HUGE fan of Buddy Guy, so I was very excited to discover this DVD. The product description says that there is tablature, there is none. There are no instructional parts of this DVD, Buddy is playing just like he does on stage. I did not nor could not learn anything from this DVD. To watch him play and see his right hand and left hand techniques is really cool, but to try to learn from and follow him in this DVD is virtually impossible unless you are a total professional. The product description makes it sound MUCH easier than it is. I am very disappointed."
4,Great for adults and kids,"This CD may be the most underrated children's CD around. It truly is a family CD. The first five songs are geared right at kids, and they may take some getting used to since the performance was recorded live, and kids don't always sing along in tune. However, the parents' part kicks in for the second half of the CD with songs that could bring tears to your eyes. The title track alone is worth the CD, but Wonderful Boy, Sail Away, and I Still Believe in Rainbows all are worth the listen. Great whether you have kids or not!"
5,Great Book. Everyone can benefit from it!!!,"I LOVE the book!!! I have given several copies to family and friends who have expressed interest in it. If you are willing to openly look at yourself without denial, then harder still, do the necessary work to make the changes within yourself as described in this book, both your personal and professional life has potentioan to become shiney bright!!"
4,Gave me a much clearer understanding of problem I'm dealing with.,I would recommend this book to anyone in an alcohol or drug diseased family. It gives insight to the conflicts that arise and debunks some very basic stereotypical thinking.
5,another Chance,"Although it is a required ""Text"" for my class, it is an easy read. Very informative...brings you into the heart of the alcoholic's family suffering."
4,Wonderful!,"American's Seashore is part of a series that includes deserts, mountains, wetlands and prairies.Author Marianne Wallace was encouraged by Mr. Page, her high school biology teacher, and we're all blessed by it. Heck, there are no children in my house but this book is staying here for my personal reference.Each seashore that makes up the United States is described, shown on a map with great illustration by the author of the birds, animals, plans and terrain.Did you know that five of the seven types of sea turtles in the world live in the Gulf of Mexico? And that after the female lays her eggs on shore, she returns to the sea?This is a great book to entertain and educate children. If you will be traveling to any of the coasts, your child will understand the area much better--and so will you.Armchair Interviews says: This and any of the others in the series would be a great gift for children or grandchildren or for holiday or gift giving."
4,Helpful,This book was great for anyone trying to get a basic grasp of macro econ without going into calculus.
2,Get Paul Krugman's book instead...,"If you want ""zero government free-market"" philosophy, read R.J. Barro's book. As a member of the conservative Hoover Institution he contaminates every single of his books (this is no exception) with his ""religious beliefs"".If you want a good book on Macroeconomics, I'd suggest Krugman's instead (or perhaps in addition to this, to compare viewpoints).Paul Krugman is much more balanced than Mr. Barro. Don't believe me? get both books and judge for yourself. Krugman's book is available at:http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0321033876/"
5,"Definetly, the best dictionary...","I'm still trying to find any defect to this dictionary, but I couldn't yet... If you are a non-native english speaker, you have to get this one... does phrasal verbs drives you crazy??? All phr verbs are there... Usage notes of frequently used words are great as well as the illustrations!!!... the samples following the definition of the words are great to understand them... although I'm still learning, I know this book has improved my english..."
3,iPod Nano skin,"This skin was just an over priced sticker. the gel covering they were talking about was just a very thin layer of gel. Other then that, it is very pretty, but of no use since it can't protect the ipod. the shipping was pretty fast, but if you are looking for an actual skin that can protect your iPod, go with something else. please."
2,poor quality,"I realize that black toliet seats are hard to come by and that this one was only twenty dollars, but I didn't expect it to fall apart before I could even use it. The screws fall out of the predrilled holes to attach the metal hinges to the seat. Quality service sent me a replacement seat with the same problem. Desperate times call for desperate measures so I used epoxy in the screw holes for now. I would not recommend this product."
1,STAY AWAY,"I should have listened to the other reviewers, but I just wanted a cheap black toilet seat with Amazon's super saver shipping. After just a few months of normal use, the screws that hold the lid on are falling out and the screw holes are stripped. Oh, well. It looked good for a while."
1,Wrong item,I received the wrong-sized item twice and immediately returned both with the proper return label but have yet to be reimbursed. Howard
1,I can't believe I didn't listen,"I read all the reviews and I still didn't listen. Mine didn't even last 5 months. This product is not worth the ""you might get a good one"" idea. Save your money and time!"
1,Awful quality,"Had to return this product 2 times. Amazon was good about the return. The lack of quality was disappointing. Both times the product arrived smashed, dented and broken. Not sure what's up with the manufacturer, but definitely not worth it. Gave up and looking for a different manufacturer."
4,Fun beyond the Dark Shadows,"This is a wonderful reference book on Dark Shadows and more. It shares great trivia and facts about the show and actors. If you want to know about the careers of the actors on AND off Dark Shadows, read this book. You can't find a book that has more wealth of information about the stage careers of these character actors. Thanks to the author for writing this book after so many years since the cancellation of Dark Shadows."
5,Very good!,"I have recently in the past year gotten into re-watching this wonderful series and finding this book was a wonderful addition. If you want to learn more about the cast, get this book!"
3,Disappointed in Range,"I was really disappointed in its ""through the wall range"".I have a wood wall, no metal involved.I get maybe a 2 foot range, almost all but useless.Seems to work better in an open area but that is not what I bought it for.For the price of this unit it should work better.I would not recommend this unit for a through the wall alarm."
1,Poor performance,"My house was recently broken into and I purchased this item, among others, as a security measure to help deter future theives. While it is simple to use it does not go through walls or windows as advertised. I've adjusted volume/range and rearranged so that the unit points directly through a window. There's no thick walls or steel structures that are interfering with it. In addition, it picks up anything that moves behind the unit inside the house (no matter what angle) which is annoying. I've tried making foil shields, etc. but can't get anything to work. It also gets 'stuck' and continues to bark after you've left the room and there's no motion. I was very excited about the product when I saw it but will be returning it. I also purchased the Rex version (which is identical, only more money)...same problems. Get a real dog if you can."
3,angry dog,"It does work, however if you are trying to use it to protect against intruders to your home it will not pick up anyone on the outside of your house if you have aluminum siding. I set mine on a large window ledge behind drapes and it does very well that way. It also seems more sensitive when approached from the rear so I have the back facing out to the deck. Sounds like a big angry dog from out side, and when testing it the first time with the back door open it got all my neighbors dogs barking."
4,"NOT a dog, but might work","I bought the Electronic Barking Watch Dog as a present and only tested it to see if it works. It does work, and is very simple to operate. Uses a LOT of batteries as a backup, and is pretty loud. The barking is OK but not great, I think anybody who had a dog or two and heard other dogs barking will recognize or at least suspect the sound to be ""fake"" after 10-20 seconds but I think that might just be enough. Coupled with other measures of protection it may be just what you want when you can't have a real. In big apartment complexes thieves who ""probe"" the doors one ofter the other to see if one is open, would probably be deterred effectively (they probably won't stop at a door on the other side of which there is a lot of barking). A determined burglar however will not be averted but they would just use pepper spray on a dog, anyway."
1,Unsatisfactory product,This product did not work as described. I have already reviewed this product and would not recommend its purchase.Complete dud. Did not work as advertised
1,Very Poor Range,This product was unable to detect movement more than 6 feet away. This made the product completely useless for sensing someone at my front door.
2,not real at all--,dog bark is continuous not real sounding since it goes very fast. I am sure most people would know its not a dog So i bought a dog that at least looks intimidating My real dog a bull mastiff has a great bark weighs 90 lbs and when he is outside he lets anyone on the property know hes there---Glad I rescued him from the Humane society because Roscoe (dog) is what this machine does not sound like Get a real dog rather than waste your money on this stubit item
3,"Sound was too mechanical and fake, sensor was not stable...","2 problems were found: 1. The barking sound was too mechanical and fake, hope it can be little random and real. 2. One of the sensors was not stable. It was set to about 80% for 5 feet away, but without changing anything, two days later, it stopped working anymore. Anyway, it is very interesting product but needs significant improvement. Hope I can receive my refund soon as I have returned via UPS one week ago."
2,Barking Dog Alarm,"I was very satisfied with the vendor, no problem. But the product itself left much to be desired. I already had/have one Barking Dog Alarm. It works great. However, this new one, although it looks precisely the same, isn't. The ""voice"" of the dog apparently has undergone some changes in manufacturing, and the barking has degraded. The quality isn't there. I would not recommend this product to anyone unless the flaw is corrected. The vendor was very good to work with, though, and returned my money quickly."
2,Barking does not sound real,The alarm does respond to movement but if you think the barking dog will sound like a real barking dog you will be disappointed. If you just want to be made aware of movement in a area of your home and you do not expect the barking to make someone think you have a guard dog you may want to consider this product.
1,Buyer Beware,"What a horrible experience. This seller sent me a totally different model, made by a different company. Then when I contacted him he said ""its the same thing"". Then When i demanded the correct model that i paid for he said, ""send it back at your expense and Ill charge you a re-stock fee of 10%"". What a horrible seller. Buyers all beware!"
2,Secure Dog Barking Dog Alarm,"Sometimes the only way to shut the dog up is to turn it off or unplug it. Does not work rightall the time. I bought the Rex Barking Dog sometime ago and I love him, he sounds so real. WishI had gotten another Rex instead."
3,great for rap/metal music lovers,"Backstreet laws cd special delivery is a good album to start listening to this central pa based band who rock every show they play. its a mix of heavy metal and rap with the occassianal ballad type vibe to it. there newest released cd ""hollow"" is available for listening at mp3.com but i deffinately reccommend this cd as well"
3,Reels are a little bit scary,"The viewmaster works fine and looks nice. It's easy enough to use and seems pretty durable. The main complaint that I have is that the reels have a lot of scary pictures - sharks and big whales behind the fish and so on. Some of the pictures are really nice, but too many have sharks and scary looking scenes. My daughter wouldn't look at it at first because of the scary pictures and then I taught her to look quickly and change it. (She's almost 3). My son is very scared of these pictures and I make sure it is a ""nice"" one before I show him. He's 1 and a half."
2,Viewmaster Finding Nemo sub-par quality,"I was excited to buy a viewmaster for my son, since I loved my viewmaster when I was a kid. The Nemo one was on sale for $5 (I think it was originally $10) and I'm glad I didn't pay full price. The viewmaster machine seems to be made of cheaper materials than the classic viewmaster. It came with 3 or 4 discs, which were great, but the viewmaster kept getting stuck and the disk wouldn't turn. Very frustrating for me, so imagine what a toddler will do.I think that $5 was too much for this piece of junk."
5,Brings Back Memories,"Being an 80's baby, I grew up having the red viewmaster. I didn't even know that they made these anymore. When I saw it, I had to get one for my two year old son. I just need some more slides to watch."
2,Not Much of a Game,"While it is mildly amusing to play this in a large group, especially if you are playing for real money, LCR is not much of a game at all. There is No strategy. No thinking. No decision making. It is completely random. You may as well have everyone put their name in a hat and then draw the name of the winner--LCR is this same experience but stretched out over 5 or 10 minutes. If you are still curious, you don't need to buy this, just find the rules on the 'net and use dice from another game."
5,DICE GAME,"FUN GAME.THIS IS A FUN GAME, SMALL ENOUGH TO FIT IN YOUR PURSE WHATEVER THE SIZE IS.HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS GAME"
5,I wouldn't call this a toy,But this is a great game to play at parties and we did at Christmas and at New Years Eve. Everyone loved the game.
5,clr,i like the product. it is fun for all ages and you can add your own variations to the game depending on the crowd and ages of players. Easy to stick in your car or purse and have anywhere.
4,well worth it,"This game was well worth the purchase. It has been enjoyed by adults and kids since I bought it. Every time we start a game, others wanted to join in!"
4,LCR,"Another very simple and fun game for people who enjoy friendly competition and social interaction. Play with real coins to make the game more interesting for adults. Easy to use, fast-paced, easy to travel with, packs easily. Great game for those periods of waiting for flights or appointments."
4,"left, right, center",This is a game that is great fun for adults at a party. We play it using(3) one dollar bills instead of the chips. For very little money it creates lots of excitement and anticipation. I bought several set for my adult children. We love it.
4,Left Center Right,"We have played this game several times in the past. It is great fun for a group of adults. The game can be used with children as well as it incorporates directionality (left, right) as well as following directions quickly."
4,Light fun,This game is fun once there are just a few coins left each so start with just four in each hand. The kids (ages 4 and 9) laughed a lot.
4,LCR Dice Game,"This is a fun party game that can be played with adults or children, or a mixture of both. My 8 year old thinks it is such fun. Add a little incentive to the game and play with coins or dollar bills instead of the chips."
4,LCR FOR FAMILY FUN,This little game is big on fun. The whole family joined in playing LCR at our Christmas gathering and all agreed it was great fun for all ages; well worth the cost.
5,Simple Fun for a Little Wager,"For those who want to gamble a little in lieu of poker after dinner, this is great fun for six to eight people. Everyone places $1 to 5$ in the pot. The last one left with money wins the pot. With eight people, the game lasts about thirty minutes. Great fun with children for pennies too."
4,Fun,We played this game on New Year and had a lot of fun. There should be at least 4 - 6 people playing.
5,great for family night and adults,"We play this game after christmas dinner with quarters and it's a blast!!! you can use quarters, dollars, skittles if you're playing with little ones, it's great!!"
5,Great travel game!!,LCR is a great game. Fun for all ages!! And it's so small you can keep it in your purse (especially on vacation) to have handy for play after dinner or while waiting for a seat etc.....
5,What a Hoot!,"This game was introduced to me in New Orleans on a visit. All were adults that played, (with some minor changes...) each time we got together during Mardi Gras! It is a ton of fun for adults, even with kids. Although Adults can use different game pieces and beverages. Honestly, we laughed and laughed! I have brought the game back to SC and introduced it to friends here, we all have enjoyed it. A great add on to a couples poker game for a change of pace. Hope you enjoy it as well!!!"
5,Fun and easy,"This is a fun, really simple game. It's built solely on luck, so it's good for kids or those who don't like to invest too much into a game. We like to play for quarters which tends to make the game a little more exciting."
4,LRC,Left Right CenterI simple but fun game involving chips and dice. There is zero thought or skill involved but can be fun nontheless. It has helped my dauther learn her left from her right.With adults with adult beverages can easily devise a fun social game.
2,Not a game,"Firstly, I should point out that this was introduced by someone into an gaming group made of adults, so I didn't originally play this with very young kids in mind. My initial reactions are that it isn't really a game. It has no real decision making, and the winner is completely random. It has a few steps to figuring out who gets points, which can at first mask this fact. But it is indeed completely random.I could see this potentially be useful for really young children to learn the difference between right and left, and how to count. However, by the time they are old enough to safely handle dice, I would expect them to know these things beyond this products ability to teach them. Although, I am not a parent, and might be wrong about this.Otherwise, you're family game time would be better spent playing something that fires some neurons. Otherwise you'd find this boring (I would think), unless you enjoy randomly finding out who wins."
4,LCR game,"Fun, quick, easy. Nice game for a social group; not much thinking involved. Lots of time for talking and socializing."
5,RLC,This game is so simple yet so much fun! I got this just before thanksgiving and our family played it all night. We use quarters instead of the chips but we all just love this game.
5,Fun For All Ages!,"My family LOVES this game. The 3 year olds have learned the concepts of left, right, center, so they are learning without even knowing they are learning. What I like about the game is that you're never really out until the last move. At any time, you could be back in the game. This keeps everyone involved."
4,Great game for a large family,"This is a really fun, easy to learn game. You can play with chips, which are provided, if you are playing with kids. If you play with grown ups, you can use quarters instead and win some money! It is fast and easy to play. I would say you'd want to play with no less than 4 people."
4,Fun and Educational,"I am a kindergarten teacher and use this game at the beginning of the school year to teach the concept of left and right. I put a sticker on each child's right hand to begin the game. After a few days, there is no need for a sticker. Of course I also love playing with my grown up friends and replacing the chips with quarters!"
3,It showed up,Don't know what else to say about this. It's a fun little game to play with a bunch of people. With many variations on the rules it can be played by just about anyone in any party time situation.
5,left center right,Great price and quick delivery.It's a great game for all ages to play together.Fast moving and fun.
5,Fun Game,"This game was played by adults who had so much fun. It certainly aroused laughter, banter and compentiveness. An easy good fun game."
5,LCR DICE GAME,"Left Center Right Dice GameGREAT TRAVEL GAME, EXCELLENT TO HAVE IN YOUR POCKET,GOOD FOR CHILDREN OF ALL AGES, FUN TO PLAY WITH USING BUTTONS OR PENNIES,FAST MOVING FUN, EXCELLENT FOR CHRISTMAS STOCKINGS OR EASTER BASKETS.THIS IS THE SECOND TIME I HAVE ORDERED SEVERAL OF THIS GAME FROM THIS COMPANY. EXCELLENT SERVICE,GOOD PRICE"
5,Great game for kids AND adults!,"We play this game whenever there are four or more of us together, and we take it with us when we travel and play with friends. You can also turn it into a drinking game with a little imagination (when you roll a ""L"", the person on your left takes a sip, roll a ""C"" and everyone drinks, etc.) and we played all night long after a recent wedding. I ordered a dozen more and gave as Christmas gifts - everyone loved it! Takes little to no concentration and is just plain fun!"
1,Dice Game,"Well I wish I new becuse I never recieved it and but have been chrged for it. It was suppose to arrive third week of December and nothing yet I would hope some one can contact me and resolve this problem, I still would love to get it since I have paid for it. Ken Breuker"
1,Product missing from tin container,"This product came in a tin and was shrink wrapped. When I opened the tine, the actual product I ordered was not there. They sent an empty tin.Very unsatisfied with this product and vendor."
1,Not actually a game,"This ""game"" isn't really a game. You roll and it either goes left center or right. Basically, it's just a random number generator, with about as much skill as playing a scratch off ticket. A lot of the reviews say things like ""great for my kindergartners to learn their left from their right"" or ""can play with any mental level"", which basically means that once you've gone beyond kindergarten, you are WAY overqualified to play this 'game'.Save your money, save your time and play something that is more advanced, like Tic Tac Toe or Rock Paper Scissors.Good For: A drunk bar betting game (1, 4, 24 is vastly superior to this however); Kindergartners who need to learn their left from their rightBad For: Anyone else."
2,WOLF IN CHEAP CLOTHING,"WOLF MOON is 124 minutes long, about 50 minutes too long. Endless panoramic vistas and unmemorable ""original"" pop songs try to compensate for the lackluster script, the flaccid direction, the listless acting, and the hilarious special effects.Obviously an attempt to lure TWILIGHT fans with its doomed love story, WOLF MOON is ultimately tiresome and tedious. Its predictable climax is limp and uninspired. Shame on Max Ryan, Maria Conchita Alonso, Chris Mulkey, Billy Drago and Sid Haig--they've all done better!Not recommended."
5,Fast & Shiny!!!,"This topcoat is fantastic!! It dries quickly and leaves a great shine especially with darker shades of polish.. And, it never thickens so you can use every drop.."
5,Very Nice,"So far I am very pleased with this keyboard. The first time I saw an advertisement for it I just thought it was another gimmic for the PC market. I was pretty much prepared to laugh at it when I went up to Ideazon's booth at E3. I figured it would feel really loose and cheap but it doesn't at all. It feels like a perfectly normal keyboard. Whenever I got back from the show, the Z-board was the first thing I ordered.Right now I only have the internet explorer interface and it is really nice. All of the hot keys are great and the secondary functions on the number pad are very useful. One of the biggest reasons I purchased this keyboard, besides the great quality, was that there are Photoshop and 3DS Max interfaces.You should go for something like this over a Microsoft keyboard anyday."
1,Nautica Frost Block Centerpiece Bowl,The bowl I received was not the one pictured. The clear one was shown and I received the black one instead. I wanted to exchange it for the clear one which was evidently not available. It took 4-5 e-mails and almost 2 months to get authorization to return the wrong merchandise. It had already appeared on my charge statement and I paid for it rather than incur interest.
3,price,"I've had my dove on this food since I've had her, 13 years now, and all of a sudden I could not find it in any store, or pet store in my city. When I last bought it for her a few months ago, I paid $ 5.89 for a 5# bag, now I paid $ 10.05 for a 5# bag. Otherwise I really love Kaytee Dove food, and so does my Dove."
5,Love it!,The only disappointment as far as this album goes is how expensive it is to get your hands on it here in the States. Another amazing release by my very favorite Aussies. Well worth the wait!
4,Cute but not average sized,"My daughter LOVES Rarity and wanted her for her birthday this year. I wanted to be sure she received one so I put this one on her wish list assuming that this was the average sized pony that her friend has. when my daughter got this pony she was not disappointed but I was a little since the description did not say anything about the size of the pony. She likes this larger pony but still wants the original, average sized pony which I now need to buy as well so she can give her friend her Rarity back!"
1,Didn't work for me,I used this with the wash n' curl shampoo and found that it made no difference to my hair. It has always been pretty stubbornly straight and fine though so it might work for different hair types. I also found that my hair smelled like chemicals until I washed it again.
4,Tampa Burn,"The title says it all,Tampa Burn is a burning thriller filled with excitement. The book will promise to keep you on the edge of your chair. Picture a man with a past that takes in spying and killing with his art of being an assassin. Now just who is this man that has changed his life from that of the past into a biologist on the Florida coast. From the peaceful life Ford now has soon changes and comes to an end when he finds out his son has been kidnapped. Along with his ex-lover and his current girlfriend he also finds himself with women toubles of the worst kind. Was the kidnapping because of Fords last employment of being an assassin or for revenge to get even for something else he has done. Thoughts run through Ford mind of who may have his son and those thoughts bring back bad memories. Join in the search and read this thriller on Fords journey to find his son as the tensions build, let the reading begin. Larry Hobson-Author- ""The Day Of The Rose"""
1,Been in the sun too long,"Doc Ford is usually interesting and fun to follow. This time he seems to have left his brain at home. Great bad guy, but no conclusion. Personal relationship revisions, past history revised, juvenile emotions in adults, missing the obvious- what's happening here? A narrative that is disjointed and unfocused. A son kidnapped, but Ford goes off on all kinds of secondary tangents. A frustrating, disappointing read."
3,Good Back up and It could be Magic,"I read White when Child, Connelly, Crais and Demille have nothing new. He is a good back up for those of us who like low brow entertainment. He ranks the lowest among my regulars because his hero, Doc Ford, seems to have no sense of humor and is presented as a politically correct James Bond. Probably not like the real Doc Ford at all when you think about it.Still, the pace is acceptable except for times when Doc goes into self-psychotherapy mode, and the characters ususally interesting. One thing that White has heads and shoulders above others is his eye for Florida. At one point he describes someone as something like nutty in a state of nuts and does that ever capture it. At the same time, there is a segment of the book in which the hero is in the Tampa area chasing the bad guy and White's descriptions of the area are magical."
2,Last Doc Ford book I'll ever read,I have read this entire Doc Ford series before this book. I suggest one of the first few for a good read. As the series moves on this supposed smart man gets dumber and more feable. His mistakes are telegraphed. Also he doesn't seem to age. As I figure it Doc would be in his early 60's dating a 30 something is just weird. I enjoyed the eatlier books in this series and more for the secondary players. Doc is just not a likeable fellow.
5,Tampa Burn by Randy Wayne White,"Doc Ford is the ultimate good guy-bad guy. A former assassin and spy, Doc's retired to the Florida coast, where he is a self-employed marine biologist living a lazy life. When his former lover, Pilar, shows up with the news that their son, Laken, has been kidnapped, Doc's world turns upside down. He must deal with the loss of his new love, Dewey, while frantically searching for his son, kidnapped by a madman whose favorite pastime is burning his victims.It seems most of the characters in this book are not particularly likeable, which makes the read all the more interesting. Prax, the fire-burning madman, is wonderfully evil -a guy you love to hate. A suspenseful, interesting read."
4,"Pushing the envelope a bit, but worth reading.","I had mixed feelings after reading ""Tampa Burn"".White expands on his charactor development of Ford and Tomlinson, and further explores their complex history and relationship. But other aspects of the book, the overly convoluted plot and general tone of the writing, I found somewhat disconcerting. White seemed at times to be writing more in the style of some of the other ""off-beat"" Florida mystery writers(Hiaasen or Tim Dorsey), which felt out of place in this novel.That being said, ""Doc Ford"" is still the best series being written today, and ""Tampa Burn"" is well worth reading.Randy Wayne White is still better than all the others at what he does."
4,My 4th White book,"A friend met White and suggested I try the Doc Ford series. Lots of twists and turns make this series an entertaining, but easy read. Reminds me of Baldacci and Patterson. I plan to continue with the Doc Ford series. I would highly reccommend Randy Wayne White to any fan of the above mentioned authors."
4,Love R W White!,"Always love RWW's writing, his characters, his extensive knowledge of our area, and his plots. Enjoying reading the older ones I missed. I highly recommend all of his books."
4,"Glad to get another Doc Ford novel, BUT","I'm a big fan of RWW and Doc Ford. In this one, Doc's son has been snatched by a Central American wacko who is disfigured and wants the kid's face for his own! Carefully crafted and plotted as usual, but somehow I didn't get the sense of urgency from Doc that I expected. Great read overall, though, and I'm looking forward to the next one. When will they get smart and start making movies out of these novels? Wonder who will get to play Doc? Not Tom Cruise, I hope ...."
2,Tampa Burn,"I am a great fan of Randy Wayne White, but this latest in the series disappoints. Too many side trips, everything gets solved in the last 10 pages, with enough cliff hangers to let you know there's another one coming. Pilar disappears as a character half way through-although she is one of the main parts to the story. EVERY other character we've ever met seems to play a bit part, Janet, Ransom, etc etc but they are not part of the story line. Not enough detail in the ending, and lots left unsaid. I hope for greater attention to telling a good tale in the next one. We love Doc and Tomlinson!"
2,Familiar stuff. Unhelpful grab-bag.,"There's nothing revolutionary here--all of the advice my grandmother used to give about avoiding refined, processed foods and eating ""natural,"" ""organic,"" fresh foods along with healthy doses of exercise, meditation, spirituality. Moreover, there's a certain arrogance about the author's prescriptions. For example, one of his dietary menus calls for ""13 grapes."" Heaven help you if it's 12 or 14. If the program doesn't work, don't blame it on Dr. Hedaya. For good measure, the author overwhelms you with advice--from weight-lifting to forming a compatible relationship with your therapist to testing for hypo-thyroidism to hormone replacement measures.In sum, this is not a book likely to help anyone who is suffering from depression nor is it a book providing useful information about antidepressant side-effects (""serotonin-syndrome,"" for example)."
2,Mediocre/Dubious,One glaring omission is that he fails to mention that SSRIs can cause permanent sexual side effects even after discontinuance. Long overlooked by the medical community. Do google search for details.
1,Hardly covers the cause of depression,"Like all we need is another book justifying why people need to stay on these dangerous psychotic drugs. Well educated and informed people know already that imbalances in brain chemistry are due to imbalances in the chemistry of the body. Start educating people about outstanding nutrition and ""miraculously"" the chemistry of the brain changes and improves as well."
2,Ehhh,"Disclaimer: I only read selections from this book!I was interested in looking through this book because 1.) people have told me it is good and 2.) I thought Blue like Jazz was terrible and cannot understand why people like his writting so much. With that in mind I purused a copy of my friends and not surprisingly found it just as underwhelming.The writing is getting better. The ""insights"" into life, while highly personal and occationally compelling, are shallow and obvious. It is like being at a Sunday sermon where the pastor preaches a moving speach, but upon reflection you realize it was just another homily.Spend the time you would be reading this book doing something much more constructive - like reading and reflecting on the bible itself."
4,Geared towards men growing up without fathers,"Upon purchasing this book I did not realize that this book was written for the male perspective of growing up without a father. This being said, the book was wonderful and I found some points I could really relate to, but I just wanted for this to be made aware of. Great read and Miller does a wonderful job of linking this subject with Christian elements."
4,March Sadness,"I interviewed Donald Miller during March Madness, and my first question was ""What do you want to talk about?"" He said, ""Well, if you really want to know, March Madness."" We talked basketball a while, about our bad picks.When we got past the madness, we got to the sadness of this book: it's about Miller growing up without a father and imagining what it would be like to have a father who was present--perhaps as overwhelming and amazing as owning a dragon.Miller, as we have come to know him in Blue Like Jazz, Painted Deserts, has an authentic voice that has become the voice of a generation."
3,"appeals to guys, as promised","Interesting book. I read it so I could understand what my son might have experienced (or is still be experiencing) growing up without a dad. The author's description of young adult men & their perspective on life was interesting, but tough to identify with."
3,"""And, when he died, all he left us was alone...""","To be perfectly blunt--this book is just full of religious stuff. And, it is coming from some guy who brags about breaking into someone else's house to steal a book he could have purchased on Amazon for a few dollars!I feel that more practical advice should have been dispensed. If your father is missing and if your mother is independently wealthy, totally frazzled from supporting the family, totally ineffective, or also missing, the half orphan should realize he/she is now totally responsible for his future. In today's Christian record keeping society, you need only step out of line once to insure you will never obtain a job that will support you or enter a good college. Societal infractions are only possible when you are descended from a ""good"" and wealthy family. You are on your own and will only succeed if you take positive steps to insure an adequate future."
4,"Excellent, funny book on CD","This book is excellent and funny. I grew up with an emotionally absent father. I really connect with and have experienced healing by reflecting on what Don wrote here. At first, Don's style of readng the book is irritating, then you get used to him, and start laughing, and end up loving him. I am a Christian, but I feel that anyone of any persuasion, who has LITERALLY ANY KIND OF FATHER ISSUES, could connect with this book. My wife had a hard time listening to it. I think it's written more for men. But that may depend on the woman."
3,Miller's Role Model Book,"Donald Miller created this book to share his insights on growing up without his father in the picture.Most of the book revolves around his experience living with his friend, John and family.This is what you would assume you'd find in a book about being role models and needing father figures in your life.Donald shares his ideas about belonging, authority, making decisions, manhood, girls (and how they toy with guys), integrity, education and a few other thoughts.It is similar to Blue Like Jazz in that you're reading ideas and thoughts from a guy who spends the majority of his time sitting around coffee shops.To Own a Dragon isn't for everyone. Even fans of Donald Miller might find it hard to read through this book as it's really written for boys.My recommendation would be to pass this one (and it's updated cover copy) for a different Miller book."
3,"Amusing, but not laugh out loud","I just finished this book and I must admit that I did chuckle at times, but I can't say I ever laughed out loud. I usually love British humor so I was really looking forward to reading this book. Perhaps the British version is funnier, or I missed some of the jokes, being American, or some of the jokes may have been lost in translation for the American market. I will definitely give other Gaiman and Pratchett books a chance, but this one did not meet my expectations. It gets a 3 stars for keeping me entertained, the unique perspective, and the interesting ideas about religion and spirituality. (I would have given 3.5 if possible, but I couldn't bring my self to give it 4)"
4,Interesting history book,"This is a very good history book. There are lots of maps and pictures of actual places/artifacts. At the beginning of each section there is a timeline that helps keep track of what period in time you are studying.This text encourages students to keep a 'history journal' about the place/time they are studying as if they are actually there. It contains a reference Atlas, a handbook section reviewing study and writing skills, and not just an English glossary, but also a Spanish glossary."
5,Songs of Yore...,"If perchance you are seeking a good translation of ""Aneirin's"" Gododdin, this probably is the one to get. Dr Koch has managed to present a very thorough reconstruction of this epic poem, with the full apparatus you'd expect from a scholarly book such as this one. Indeed, you get a long and precise discussion of the text in the introduction, an Old/Middle Welsh - English facing translation and complete footnotes to help you make the best out of the text. Be warned, though. This book isn't for the faint of heart nor for the neophyte who expects an introduction to the subject or to the field of Insular Celtic Studies. The author expects the reader to be at the very least familiar to the setting of Dark Age Britain. Yet, since you are reading this, surely this warning is useless. All in all, the best your money can buy if only a bit mind-boggling in its sheer complexity. But for this, it is I who is to blame !"
3,"Average as a translation, better as a reconstruction","The basic aim of this book is to show that Aneirin, who lived in the 7th century C.E., could have written the ""Gododdin,"" which was first transcribed (that we know of) in the 13th century C.E. To do this, Koch works backwards from the text we have in the Book of Aneirin. The first half of the book is the introduction, which as O.J. Padel noted read more like working notes than anything intended for public consumption, and surely not for the casual reader.This is a brilliant work in its own right, but readers looking for a good English translation of the Gododdin might be better off looking at Jarman's work, which is quite poetic and is bilingual between English and modern Welsh."
4,Not for beginners,"If you have never met _Y Gododdin_ before, don't start with this book - go look for a copy of A. O. H. Jarman's bilingual edition instead. On the other hand, if you are already an enthusiast, buy it by all means - you will find much here to interest, intrigue, educate, challenge and possibly annoy you. The long introduction is practically a book in itself, if a rather dense one; the translations (there are, in a manner of speaking, two - Koch's reconstructed Old Welsh version of the medieval manuscript, plus his English translation) are also interesting, if very literal-minded. I do recommend this book - but not for beginners."
1,Not a Translation!,"This is a very, very loose reconstruction of the text, based on Koch's own theories about the Celtic proto-language that Old Welsh dveloped from. This 'proto-language' is itself little more than a theory and therefore the validity of the work is dubious. Most of the ""evidence"" presented here has been disproved by Graham R. Isaac ('Readings in the History and Transmission of the Gododdin'; 'Gweith Gwen Ystrat and the Northern Heroic Age of the Sixth Century'). Although a fair attempt at the impossible, this book is at best misleading."
3,Works OK...,"It does work if you can get it connected. I had problems getting the spark plug fitting down over the plug in my 16V Volvo head. Had to modify a tool to push it on. The plug boot needs to be longer to allow it to be easily pushed down into twin cam heads. The other end also would not stay clipped into the plug lead without me holding it firmly in place. Both ends of the device could use some redesign. However, once I struggled to get the thing hooked up, it worked great."
3,st,"Seems well built. I couldn't get it to work with a coil over plug setup. I had to hold it into the coil because it had a spring loaded connection instead of snap onto the plug. Then the wire wouldn't reach the plug. Then tried to use a cheaper clamp on spark tester pushed into the tester boot, then hold the tester into the coil with one hand, and reach over to turn the key. That method worked, but on a car, you wouldn't be able to hold it under the hood, then turn the key inside of the car. I checked, and they don't make an adapter for coil over plug setups."
5,Works as described,"To get this tool to work you turn off your engine and then attached one rubber end to the spark plug and the other end to the spark plug wire. Then, start the engine. The light shines fairly bright and the light pulses. So, if the spark plug is not firing as good as the other plugs, the light will not pulse as frequently or as bright."
4,Great product!,Featured in Cycleworld. This unit replaces the 18yr old Lisle spark tester in my tool box. The old unit only failed after repeated abuse. Use it for safety as well as protecting 6v ignition/mag on your old iron.
2,Didn't work too well for me,"Purchased this spark tested to troubleshoot rough idling problems with my 4-cylinder car. It did not work too well for me as my spark plug was fairly deep in the spark plug well. I had a hard time plugging the end into the spark plug, having to carefully fish it down to seat/mate it properly with the spark plug.Also when removing the tester from the spark plug, I had to pull on the wire as I could not access the boot from down in the tube. I don't know how this will affect the longevity of the connections but I assume pulling on the wire won't make it last too long.If you have a short spark plug tube, this will work well for you."
3,Matches are sub par,I am highly disappointed with the matches. Only 2 Flair matches but none of his matches with Douglas against the Blondes.At least we get Rick Rude vs Steamboat.
3,small and fast,"This grinder is small and fast. I use it daily in conjunction with various other air tools,most of which are IR. I like the large handle release which makes it easy to get past the safety feature. The tool works fine and was priced right. Then why the 3 star rating? All my other IR tools (which are 20 years old or older) were manufactured in the ""land of the free"". This tool, however, was manufactured in the land of the not so free. Perhaps a year or so from now I'll post again and let you know if its still running. Or maybe sooner...."
2,air valve lever,The tool works fine but I found the air valve lever difficult to use. The lock off lever seems to travel too far into to lock off position. I had to make some modifications to change position.
3,90' Angle Hi-speed Grinder,I don't have all of the manufactures Specs but you could put in RPM's and the amount of air this tool uses at 75psi and 90psi. It would be most helpful in making a decission of which product to purches.
4,"Moody, Cure-ish alt-pop with clean, affecting vocals.","I took a chance on this album pulling it out of a bargain bin. I'm glad I did. I was very pleasantly surprised with an album full of mostly low-key, mature pop song stylings from a mostly one-man band by the name of Tim McAllister. McAllister's voice has a nice range of affective emotions from melancholy to growing hope. Several of the songs have a story outline to them and, while the lyrics are fairly routine, the music and arrangements are evocative and serve the songs nicely. ""Gently Down (Last Thursday)"" is a heart-breaking eulogy for his sister and her passing and shows what fine, little snippets of life can be captured in song. I've given this album 4 stars because some of the synthesized music dates the album. However, if you're ever in the mood to chance a Cure-ish, emotionally rich album you could do a lot worse."
5,"One Voice, Many Bodies","I love this CD, I find it very relaxing. The story teller has a mystical voice."
3,"This is a a cheaply made smaller than deceptively pictured novelty item only - butt let's face it, I'm keeping it.",I've been looking for a towel for the gym to shield me from the sweat of the last rude person on the equipment who didn't use a towel and this towel is perfect. Most towels this size (which is smaller and thinner than pictured) are the same color on both sides so that I lose track of which side was against the equipment and which was against my face. Now I will know where my face was and where my butt was and which side was against the equipment since the other side of the pictured towel just has the butt and face words backwards.
1,crummy quality,"This was a great gag gift, but if you're looking for a quality towel, this is not the one for you."
2,Very small,I bought it for christmas present. It arrived on time.Problem : it is very thin and it shrinks in the dryer...
5,Never get confused again...,"Face = face. Butt = butt. Great gift for the gym lover in your life. Well, that's what we used it for. Got lots of laughs. Seems like a pretty good towel as well."
5,Great Gag Gift!,"I've found this towel is perfect for those people who can't tell their head from their butt. Lets face it, everyone has at least one of those people on their list."
3,"Correct me if I'm wrong, butt...","If you need a seperate towel for your butt and your face, then your butt isn't clean enough when you leave the shower."
3,Perfect for drying your bottom! and face!,These towels are perfect if you easily confuse your top from your bottom - like astronauts do!
4,"Butt-face, how can you go wrong","This towel is as advertised, except not as big as the picture would imply. It's a gag-gift, not a beach towel. The terry cloth is of average quality, certainly not a luxuriant boutique store bath towel."
1,total rip-off -- its a scam,"sent this as a gift. Boy was I embarrassed when I saw what they received. Two hand towels stitched together. Maybe 30"" total. Not as large as a cheap bath towel. I deserve a total refund for the dishonest potrayal of this product. The picture of this towel covering two people is a farce. Disgusted that I was swindled with this scam."
3,Picture is misleading,"I bought this towel as a joke for my husband. When I looked at the picture of the couple standing behind the towel, I got the impression that it would be that big. It isn't even half the size of the white half of the towel."
3,"cute, but not as pictured","Ok, it gets a few stars for being a really funny towel. But it is very thin & small. It is not a big as it looks in the picutres. Not good for drying off after a shower. But ok if you just want to dry your face (or butt)!"
5,Hillarious!,Thanks for the great product! My fiancé is very very anal (no pun intended!) about his towel and cant have the area that touches his behind touch his face. So this keeps things in order! LOL! Not a very absorbent towel so it was just a funny gift.
2,nice funny towel but small,I purchased this towel for my 18 year old as a funny gift. The towel is not as big as the picture shows. It does not cover two people. I would of given it a 5 star if it wouldn't have been so small. I know the the description probably states the measurements but it is really miss leading when they display it so big on the picture.
3,towel,towel is smaller than a normal bath towel and thin. the picture is misleading. it was a good joke present.
3,Very small,"The towel needs to be larger, no way two people could get behind this one, still made nice stocking stuffer.."
5,It was a great gift.,This is the perfect gift for someone who has a great sense of humor. We bought this as a prank Christmas gift and it was a hit.
1,Fliimsy Towel,I know this is supposed to be a funny but the towel doesn't have to be so cheaply made. The picture definitely makes the towel look a lot bigger than it really is. Cheaply made and not usable for after bathing. Rather a rag to clean the floor.
2,Much smaller than pictured,Towel is much smaller than even an average towel. A bit disappointed in that. It was not very thick either.
1,Small Thin Cheep,"The picture of the two people holding the towel is false. It is a very thin and short towel, that does not even reach around my body and i have a 33 inch waist. This towel is good for being a hand towel and not much else."
2,face and butt towel,This towel is really cheap!! Cute and nice gag gift but very thin and not absorbent at all. It also is not as big as shown in the photo with two people standing behind it. Would not recommend.Westminster Butt Face Towel - Model# 0076
2,Smaller and thinner than the photo. Beware,"I purchased this as a gift for a family member. The actual towl is much smaller than pictured and very thin. While it is a funny gag gift, it would not be functional if someone would intend to actually use it. If you are looking for a giggle, it should be fine but skip this product if you expect it to be functional."
1,sneaky sneaky,Pay attention to the dimensions of this product. The company that makes theses are corrupt and sneaky...the picture makes the product look twice as large as the actual size. People like this shouldn't be allowed on amazon.
3,Pictures out of aspect,"The towel is well made however one of the pictures shows a couple standing behind the towel, this would not be possible for all but the smallest of people. The actual towel size is slightly smaller than a standard bath towel. Adequate but not as pictured."
1,JUST PLAIN BOOTY!!!!,"THIS TOWEL IS TOTAL BOOTY & FALSE ADVERTISEMENT!!!!! From the photo, you would think that this was a HUGE PLUSH BEACH SIZED TOWEL of HEAVY WEIGHT.... THINK AGAIN!!!!!From what was delivered, I can tell that photo enhancement was the order of the day. This towel was just about PAPER THIN mad from the CHEAPEST of RAG TERRY CLOTH and is ONLY AS LARGE AS A HAND TOWEL AT BEST.BUYER BEWARE.... or you will have your FACE crying in the BUTT part of this item! LOL"
2,thin a paper,The towel is very thin and not very good quality. I was very disappointed with this purchase it was a gift for my son. Picture online looks great product sucks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,Not what it seems in the picture,"The quality of the towel is really cheap. I paid a lot for a tower, but got a small towel that i could have gotten from a dollar store. I was going to gift it to someone for Christmas, but ended up not doing that because it was cheap material."
2,not a good towel,"first wash , the white side was full of brown knobbies, (washed on normal cycle)took for ever to pick off, same thing after each wash , after about 5 washes this towel looks like a very old towel. It sure did not hold up well at all. Not worth the money , it's not that funny, .. And it is not as big as the piture makes you think, a whole lot smaller.."
5,Great Recipes for Spiritual and Physical Healthiness!!,This cookbook is a blessing. It has helped me focus on healthier eating from both a physical and a spiritual aspect. The recipes are all natural. Everything is made from scratch. It is extremely wonderful for people who like to cook and plan their meals ahead.
3,A little dissapointed,"I also have Neva and Jim Brackett's ""The Seven Secrets Cookbook"".I have had better luck cooking successfully out of it that the Gourmet one. The Gourmet one has ingredients I am not familiar with and the results I get from cooking the recipes are not as successful.I also wondered why the used books are listed at $ 40.00 + and upon receiving the book I noticed the back cover quoted the price at $ 14.95. I received a discount when I oredered buy my daughter ordered two at over $ 80.00 and hers were not in a binder like mine was, her pages were paper and mine more like cardboard and like mine, her back cover quoted the price at $ 14.95.I e-mailed the gal I got mine from and asked her if she could shed any light on it and she has not e-mailed me back.I would appreciate it if you at Amazon could give me an answer.Thanks for the opportunity to voice my concerns.Deloris Huyck"
3,"A little bit too ""new age-y"" for me.","After reading the introduction, I knew this book was not really up my alley so to speak due to all of the references to ""spirits"" but I read it anyway as it was required for a business group I attend. A lot of what she says in here is just plain common sense but it was good to be reminded to trust your own instincts."
1,Does NOT bond instantly,"The two pieces I needed to glue together were in a very difficult place to access (inside a car door panel), so instant bonding was what I was looking for first in an appropriate adhesive. This product does not do the job. I held the pieces together for 15 seconds, then 30 seconds, then for a minute. They just fell apart the moment I let go. I should have just stuck (no pun intended) with Krazy Glue or Gorilla glue."
2,Advanced Players Only,There is some incredible guitar playing going on on this DVD. As an intermediate player (about 8 years now) the instruction was not something I could follow and apply.
2,Not really instuctional.,"This DVD is for advanced players only!!! Unless you have mastered chord theory, and music theory, or you have a natural ear for pitch you will be in way over your head. It is not really instructional but more of a demonstration. Like many of the ""hot licks"" dvd's its not really structured learning, more of a musician demonstrating some licks. But Gatten moves too fast and is very disorganized. I would not buy this DVD again and wish I had my money back. I would learn about as much just having a DVD of him performing in concert.The best ""Hot Licks"" DVD's I have seen of yet are Warren Haynes Blues and Slide guitar and Ronnie Earl DVD."
3,LOTS of chords!,"Danny Gatton is an amazing guitarist...this is for sure. However, this video is strictly for advanced players. Just learning to fret 10% of the chords he uses would take me (an intermediate guitar player) months of practice. Even HE doesn't know the names of some of the chords! Also, as another reviewer noted, it's next to impossible to see where he's got his fingers sometimes because of the glare. It's fun to watch though!"
3,Havent goten to use it but,DO not expect the nice relaxing green colors its being advertised with its an obnoxious blue. With little to no reviews out there Im on the fence after buying this.
1,Waste of money,This toy is very difficult to put together and is too hard for a young child to manipulate. It is made out of shoddy material and is very flimsy. The pieces are too difficult to put together and is uneven when put together. I feel that I have wasted $20 and wish that I had spent a little more on a higher quality marble run.
4,A-maze-ingly fun!,"This product has been out for several years now and still is a pretty popular toy. How it works is, you stack the plastic pieces together to make a maze for the marbles to got down. Some pieces are tubes, some are ramps and some have a wheel that the marble spins around on to get to the next section of maze. It takes some critical thinking to get the maze right and the use of small motor skills to get the sections together. It is really fun for home or a classroom. I do not recommend this toy for under the age of 5, however, because of small parts."
3,It's okay.,"My boys, 2.5 and 4.4 years, enjoy playing with this marble run but the plastic is definitely not strong or high quality. We will see how long it lasts but for $14, I thought we would give it a try. I would not pay more for it, that's for sure. Not very stable if my young boys knocks it over but will stand its ground if you set up a good track. My 4 yr old can put a few pieces together to make his own track but they need help to build a big course. Regular marbles to work on it, but they are all different sizes, so some might get caught in the spinner and others will roll right though. My boys make it a game to see which ones get stuck . Again, not high quality or strong plastic but worth the $14 for the time my boys will play with it."
3,A lilttle disappointing,"I purchased this for my 4 year old son. He loved the idea of it, but it was much more challenging to assemble then we anticipated. Its not like you can just hook it all together and then the marble goes. You have to really plan it out and keep testing whether the marble goes the way you are intending it to go. Also, my son backed up and stepped on a piece and it broke in half, so maybe rubber, as opposed to plastic, would be more sturdy. I was also under the impression if you dropped the marbles at the top, they could find different ways down to the bottom. Not the case. They all went the same way, so much of the structure went unused... although it ""looked"" like it would be cool."
3,You get what you pay for,"This is one of those products that's not bad, but just okay. You probably get what you pay for. I know there are more expensive marble runs out there that probably work much better, but I didn't want to spend a small fortune on yet another toy. The pieces are a little awkward and don't fit together the best. It sometimes has a hard time staying upright. This works okay and has probably served its purpose just fine in our house (given that my 4 year old son has a relatively short attention span with ANY toy)."
2,Disappointed,This toy was a disappointment because the plastic it was made of was so thin that after assembling and reassemi g a couple of time the pieces broke. In fact after only ones nth now the entire toy has been thrown away. A complete waste of myMiney
3,a few things I'd change,"Firstly I have a small issue with the marbles They look like candy! Bright blue , red yellow white it'd be way too easy foe some tot to mistaken it for a gumball or hard candy pop ot in their mouth to either choke or break a tooth. As the aunt of a 2 year old I notice. I agree more than 1 output piece woud be nice & more ramp pieces rather than the clear extenders they're helpful but the ramps are after all the fun part. . still a very neat toy."
4,Marble Run,"This is going to be a Christmas gift, so I haven't been able to determine how sturdy it is. It is very colorful and seems to be a fun toy.It will challenge my grandson. I will enjoy watching him create designs."
5,give it a chance,"I did the research and heard the complaints and I think a phd thesis can be made by studying how peoples' (rising) expectations today contrast to the overall (decline in) quality of all manufacturing and then cross compare it with 50 years ago and then end up by telling everyone to get over it. This item is a great deal. It needs some patience and some brains, if you have none, Amazon can not sell you any. It is well made but does reflect the cheapening quality we parents are used to when we replace toys of our youth. I personally recommend getting 2 sets because the kids love it, and we benefit from having more kids playing together than taking turns. It does have a great variety of pieces, some other sets seemed to have 1 or 2 more types of spins and bumps but I like the quality of this one."
5,Excellent fun,"This is such a good toy for constructive play. It gets children thinking in three dimentions and a bit of physics (gravity) thrown in. All the children I have gotten it for will spend time trying to make the marbles go where they want. It would be nice to have larger pictures of the models shown on the box, sometimes it is hard to see which way to turn the channel pieces, but we just ""try it out"" and the children like that too. The holder for the wheel is fragile, we broke one the first time we were using it. It is excellent fun."
2,"Great idea, but flimsy design","We purchased this marble run for our 4-year old son because of his great love for wooden marble run assembly blocks, which he has been using since he was 2. While this set ia terrific idea and certainly has a lot of educational value, it is made of very flimsy plastic and is in no way durable. Taking it apart and putting it back together in different configurations (which should be half the fun) always proves fatal for at least one more piece of the set for us; they crack and spliter off sharp chards every time. While I love this idea and love wooden marble sets, I regret purchasing this and certainly don't recommend it as it is made of such flimsy plastic."
2,poor quality,"I had a marble run toy that was so much fun when I was a kid. In contrast to the marble run toy I had as a kid, this Quercetti brand marble run toy is made of poor quality plastic and is very frustrating. The kids have a much harder time putting this Quercetti marble run together than than my childhood toy (which they get to use when they visit my parents)."
3,Needs To Stay Together Better,"This toy can provide a great deal of fun and enjoyment for both a 6 year and 8 year old. The assembly was a bit tedious and the instructions were basically useless. The photo on the box provided much more help than the instructions. I guess Lego has spoiled me for quality, but this was frustrating to the kids due to the slightest knock and it came apart. The concept is excellent and so is the potential play value but the inability for it to stay assembled detracts from the enjoyment."
5,FUN,This is a cool toy that is not flimsy or cheaply made. It was a good price and fun for our whole family. The kids enjoy creating different structures and routes. It came when it was supposed to in good shape.
4,grandma,"I had to help my grandson to assemble this. It was good since he loves marbles, but it did not stay together, and he lost interest in it in just a few minutes.I think they need to work on keeping it together better."
5,Found a replacement lens!!!,I am glad to find a replacement lense. I could not find one around home but was glad to find one here. Thanks for a great product.
4,It is a pretty good controller...,Dont get me wrong i like the controller its comfortable (despite the fact that it gives u sweaty hands). But outta my own stupidity i thot it was a dualshock 2 controller but it aint. I ended up tryin to play star wars battle front 2 on it and it dont work. I thot it worked on nfl street? so i look at the bak and it says analog control on street and dualshock2 on battlefront. But dont blame it for my mistake. Although i do think they were tryin to rip me off cuz on the pack it said ps2 control. And i also think that the plastic is not hard enuff it would break too soon.
4,My daughter likes it..but it is not too durable.,"My 3 year old daughter is, like many girls her age, a HUGE Dora fan!! When her third birthday came up (Dora theme also!)she chose This toy and the Dora roller skates as her birthday gifts. She plays with it often and truly enjoys seeing the scenes change. (I liked it at first because I remembered having one as a child.)Still, the truth is that the cardboard that holds the pictures is flimsy. I wish they made them stronger. But you can't ask for much for the price. Bottom line, get it! If your child likes Dora she will enjoy this toy."
3,Dora Explorer View Master is not as good as I remember,The pictures were okay. The cards the photos were on were kind of flimsy. My 3 year old granddaughter was not as interested in it as I thought she would be.
4,Easy Read with Great Information,"This book really gets to the core of successful selling. It emphawsizes identifying and understanding the decsion makers wants which are personal, emotional, and under the surface. Too many sales people focus on the surface stuff especially customers needs. What we really should do is tie in want based selling into our successful needs based approache we are curretnly using.This book is a very easy read. Key points are emphasized and repeated several times to make sure they sink in. The charts and exercises used really help you grasp the concepts.The only downside is the first helf of the book tends to be very repetitive and you wonder are they having going to get to some other points. However the second half of the book is fantastic! It really gives you excellent ideas and techniques for identifying decsion makers wants and applying the concepts to your customrs.Enjoy and Good Selling!"
3,Very good for historical research;,"Not so good for telling an interesting story in an interesting way. The author gives a tremendous amount of information on the life of Butch Cassidy, as well as on his sources for that information, and does an admirable job of admitting that we really don't know how that life ended; he gives a detailed account of the standard version of Butch & Sundance's deaths (shot in Bolivia) as well as detailed accounts of the various alleged sightings of Butch after that, and the pros and cons of those alleged sightings. He admits that he just isn't sure what the truth is, and leaves it at that. But if you expect a biography of as exciting a person as Butch Cassidy to be itself exciting, this book will be a disappointment; it is not told in a narrative style, but in the style of a researcher, and very little of the character of Butch comes through. It teaches facts, but does not really give much of a feel for the person it is about."
4,Interesting,"This book is filled with details about Butch Cassidy. It has all the information you would want to know...but I'm not giving it 5 stars, because it is written in a dry, academic tone, like the author was a professor submitting this to an academic historical journal. It's too bad these details were not set down by someone with a more lively writing style, like Tom Wolfe. BUT, the information itself is often fascinating, and it confirms William Goldman's (the author of the BUTCH movie screenplay) assessment that EVERYBODY liked Butch. Goldman himself gives great details about Butch Cassidy in his book ADVENTURES IN THE SCREENPLAY. That is to be recommended as well. This book is good, though, just not great."
2,How to ruin a good story!,"Well researched yes! Boring - yes! What can be more frustrating than reading a book which is so obsessed with minor, irrelevant details as to render the readability an incredible chore. Surely there must be a better, more accessible and entertaining detailed account of the lives of Butch and Sundance than this!!!"
2,"Restored? Abridged, actually...","This book advertises itself as a ""restored"" edition, but the text is the same as that of the first edition. Except that it's abridged significantly. Nothing has been restored that wasn't already available, and quite a bit has in fact taken out."
5,The only one of it's kind,"Tim Down's really has a good grasp on what our mission is as Christians in western culture. This is the only book that I know that addresses the principle of sowing (in order to eventually reap a great harvest of souls) in such a concise, practical manner. If you need help in your evangelism efforts (and who doesn't these days?) this is the book to read on the subject. It's not a new methodology or insight - just a great treatise on a largely forgotten biblical principle. We are now using this book for our teachings in our church - and my hope is with this review to help get it into the hands of Christian leaders everywhere."
1,This book is pathetic,I love books and anything to do with the PIC but puh-leaze don't waste your time and money on this one. It's pathetic. The guy tries to be a comedian and it totally gets in the way of teaching the subject at hand. The print is large like its for the blind or something. Pages and pages of pure drivel. It's got absolutely nothing going for it at all.
1,Don't waste your money,This book is a real waste of money. It contains reprints of files you can download for free right off of Microchip's site. The author has a knack for electronics. Okay. Be more creative! I have most of the other PIC books available but this was the biggest waste of $58.00 I every made!
2,concerns of the plastic knob and steam valve construction,"I have just received the set yesterday. To our disappointment, I have found that the entire knob and steam control valve was constructed by plastic. A large portion of the plastic will be exposed to the inside steam while cooking. Anybody has the same concern? After some search, it seems to me that all the steam control valves for waterless cookware are constructed in this way no matter what the brand is."
1,Author lost his license,See for yourself. I don't think I will be buying this book. Sounds as if his own treatment is not working for himself. Nor is he professional.[...]
5,Excellent experience,I was happy with everything involved with this seller. The product is what they said and it came very promptly.
1,NB re editions,"This has nothing to do with content, just with ordering. There is ONLY ONE BOOK. Somehow, searching Amazon for this title, I got the idea there was a book, and a companion 'workbook'. Not. So, I ordered both. What we got was the book (ISBN 1572243090) and a 'large print' version of the same (no ISBN, AFAICT; just, 'X0004VP7OF').The mistake was entirely mine; but, just in case someone else is confused, take heed.BTW, the 'large print' version is kind of crap: where the original has a blank section for you to write in, the 'large print' edition will have ""[this section intentionally left blank in original document]"". It makes for some pretty ugly, and useless, pages.George"
2,Please edit this book,"Reading this book (for kindle) I got the impression that no one has proof-read this version, it has more mistakes than I'm willing to overlook.The book itself was alright, but like has been suggested by other readers, the book by Linnehan is a much better read, and I would not recommend buying this one."
3,Tx,"I was hoping for some things I could utilize in a group....a topic. However, I think it is a good workbook overall for an individual but didn't meet what I needed. It's ok but not great."
1,Avoid the English Version,"I'm not even really sure how great this game is. I generally enjoy the sci-fi type games, and I tend to lean toward strategy/role playing, so this title attracted me.I could get past the grammar and spelling mistakes in the translation, and the ridiculous character names and voices (obviously translation mistakes), but the game was nearly impossible. I can't tell if perhaps it is because there is something I should be doing differently due to the fact that the game was originally not written in English. Some of the controls don't seem to make sense, certain attacks don't seem to do anything at all, etc. etc.All in all, this ended up being a waste of money for someone who generally enjoys these types of games. When I bought it, I was expecting something like the two original Fallout RPG's, but what I ended up with I'm not exactly sure. Perhaps I'll try it again someday, but my first experience with this game was enough to keep me away from it for a good long time."
3,Not as good as other eyebrow whiteners out there...,This on wasn't as good as I'd hoped. Seemed small out of the bag and the white didn't pick up on the eyebrow as well as others that I've used.
2,Not again,"I was expecting a little easier application. The white out was so thick that by the time I had enough on my eye brows, I had to clean my fore head. Other than that it wasn't bad.The shipping box was an over kill. It could have been shipped in an envelope and cost less. The sipping was as much as the product. I'll be looking for a different product next year, but not here."
2,Not what I was looking for.,"I have done a few sections of the PCT and am probably going to do Stevens Pass to Snoqualmie Pass next summer. I hoped this book would give a good description of that section but I don't think it did. It split the section into two and did it from South to North, which didn't help me much. (For example elevation gains were useless). I am certain there is some valuable information in this book, but I didn't think it was presented as well as it should be. I am guessing there are much better books on the same subject that include profiles and/or topo maps and detail information on camp sites, water supplies and other vital information one needs when planning more that a day on the PCT. 2.5 stars, but not quite 3. The edition I have was printed in 2000 so also needs updating. With so much info on line about the PCT I don't find this a valuable reference any longer."
1,Lost in space,"I still like the idea of this book, and the cover photo isn't bad, but the book itself is yet to materialize. I ordered it a month ago from goHastings and haven't seen hide nor hair of it. Dang the luck!"
1,Tossed it out,I did not like it at all - it tasted horrid - it stained my toothbrush - it was not what I expected. I finally tossed it out.
2,NO back up evidence to prove it works?.,i have been searching for an hour on the info of how well this product worksso far i have found 0 evidence to back up their claim that it tightens gums or does anything else they claim it doesi would not recommend this product unless of course you want to gamble with the health of your gums or teeth i say go ahead
2,Harmful to gums!,"Following directions for this product on the Dr. Christopher's website, I used this as a gum pack, hoping it would tighten up my teeth and receding gums. For six nights a week, I applied to the gums around my bottom teeth, and the gums did seem to tighten up a bit. Encouraged, I decided to try the same regimen for my top teeth. Big mistake. The gums turned red and receded even more. When I stopped using the powder on my top teeth, the gums returned to their natural color. I am very disappointed in this product and cannot in good conscience recommend it, since it actually hurt my gums instead of healing them. If you are looking for something to heal swollen or bleeding gums, I recommend squeezing a CoQ10 gel caplet and applying that to gums instead."
5,Hygienist Was Amazed!,"When I went to my last cleaning, the hygienist couldn't find anything to clean off of my teeth. She checked my chart to make sure that I hadn't come in too soon. Ha! It keeps my mouth, teeth, and gums feeling like I just left the cleaning chair."
3,Herbal Tooth Powder,Its okay but over time the herbs do turn your toothbrush brown. I like the IPSAB tooth powder more.
2,Can stain teeth?,"After obtaining the tooth powder and seeing it was green, I did a google search and saw people complaining about the powder staining the teeth. I contacted one seller and she said the powder can stain teeth, but that a dental hygenist can remove the stains. I stopped using the product.White oak bark is a relatively cheap product ($2.00 a pound from an an herb store) and it will not stain the teeth. Therefore, if you are buying this product for the benefits of white oak bark, you would be better off buying it and using it than this green looking powder.Because this product stains the teeth, I tried the IPSAB powder. IPSAB cleans the teeth extremely well, but the salt content was so high that I decided I would rather not have high blood pressure. I now use a powder made by NARA. It has salt, but is not salty."
5,Delicious tooth powder,"Not sure what this does for my teeth/gums, but it tastes great, is very gentle on your gums and makes your mouth feel fresh. I use a dedicated separate toothbrush for this powder because it tends to stain the brush and get far into the bristles (probably like other tooth pastes/powders but this one is very visible because of its color)."
5,Love this toothpaste,I will never go back to regular toothpaste. My mouth feels soo clean ! Will definefinetly reorder. . Thank you.
1,Saitek J64 P3000 Wireless Pad,"I have had the pad for 3 months and am disappointed with not only the pad but also the lack of customer service that Saitek provides. The indicator light, on the base always shows that it is charging, the pads battery strength is either all, or the pad goes dead. The strength indicator is fake or does not work. Also the pad looses communication with the base at, what seems to be the worst possible time. Even when I have the base with in a clear 4 inches of the unit they loose communication on a regular basis. I contacted customer support at Saitek over a month ago and never received ANY reply to my email. I do not recommend buying this and furthermore recommend Logitec products. I have one of their force feedback joysticks and am happy with it."
1,Battery Issues,"As all of the other posters state this controller has a serious issue with its batteries. I, too, contacted the company and without any question they sent two replacement... no qualms with that kind of service, but the new batteries died just as quickly. I even tried removing the back cover (which was successful) revealing 2 NiMH 1.2V 280mAh batteries. However, the were both seated in the casing properly. I may try and replace them, however the bottom line is that I shouldn't have to go through all of this hassle. My recommendation is to buy a wireless PC gamepad that works the first time... am I not wise? :-)"
2,Saitek P3000 Wireless Game Pad,"In the box this thing comes with your standard paperwork, a CD with the drivers, the usb ""docking station"" that charges the batteries and receives the rf signal, the controller and two rechargeable batteries. Out of the box one of these batteries didn't work at all. Plugging it into the charger would not turn on the charging light and plugging it into the controlled would not power it. The other battery seemed to work fine and for a time (about 4 days) this controller did its job very well. After a couple of charges, however, the second battery went the way of the first.I have called their tech support and they should be sending me new batteries shortly. Assuming that this solves my problem I have no other complaints about this controller. It plays my emulated console games rather well will full analog functionality (when it had power that is). If I hadn't had this battery problem this pad would have got 4 or 5 stars."
3,PROS & CONS,First let me say the controller is pretty good.The controller handles great and its very light but a bit slippery The install is a bit troublesome but great support will get you up and running.The only cons i believe is you must have the docking station in view or in a least a couple feet The wireless not to strong And the battery well they have issues they dont hold a charge very long So you need more than one battery and you may get a bad one from them just sitting around But SAITEK online support is very good and they will work with you on them issues or any one you may have.
1,Batteries are horrible,The proprietary battery packs have horrible cells in them which you can immediately tell if you open one up. Unfortunately they are non standard length... shorter than a AAA so they cannot be replaced without serious modifications to the pack... more trouble than it is worth. Both of my battery packs are bad and I have hardly used it.
4,Awesome Gamepad,"Good feel to it and very light. Rubber handles are a nice touch. Highly recommended gamepad. 1 small quibble, the CD with the drivers on it came warped so I downloaded them from the saitek website, it the only thing that kept the P3000 from earning 5 stars from me."
2,"battery problems, poor performance","1 of the 2 rechargable batteries it came with didn't work right out of the box. After over a month, the second battery started having problems; for example, I'd have to keep on re-inserting it into the gamepad or the recharger before it recognized it was in.I contacted customer support about the problem. They said my batteries were defective and that they would mail me new ones. I never received it, and this was months ago.There are other problems too. The calibration of the analog sticks gets messed up during gameplay occassionally. Sometimes, the buttons aren't responsive; you press a button and it either doesn't register or registers late. Lastly, the rubber on the analog sticks wear out badly after a year (I don't even use it that much b\c of the battery problems).The feel of the gamepad alone is good though. The buttons are in comfortable places, and there are enough of them to be able to setup most games. Unfortunately, the performance\quality isn't good."
1,wish i read these reviews before buying,"bought this particular item from another website. should've checked out amazon's reviews first. like everyone else, i received a defective battery. i actually shipped the gamepad back and got a replacement from the vendor. and the replacmenet sucks just as bad.while the batteries seems to work, the gamepad has massive calibration problems, even with Saitek's recommended fixes. it takes me about five minutes of fiddling around the analog sticks, unplugging/replugging the batteries, for it to work properly. i've only had it (the second gamepad) for a few weeks, and it only seems to get worse.this is the worst product i've ever bought, and i will never buy a product from Saitek again.(btw, if you include the return shipping charges, i've spent over fifty dollars on this gamepad. last week, circuit city had a rebate for it to make it less than twenty total. hey saitek - you suck!)i strongly urge amazon to discontinue carrying this product."
4,"Great feel, one prob","I love the feel of this gamepad...after trying several others this is the best. The wireless works ok, i was 20 feet away and it was working.The batteries are what needs improving according to many posts. I thought i had a dead battery but it ended up being a bad connection inside. With a small screwdriver pushed up through the bottom can take apart the battery case. on the positive side of each battery there are two small pieces of plastic. you just need to push these down so the battery has a better chance of connectiing. i also found new batteris at interstate battery store, 1 dollar each. The analog sticks could be a little tighter, but i like the d pad. wireless is great!"
5,wet or dry,"great for camping! when accompanied with the fire steel it works wonders, no need to ever be worried about getting caught in a sticky situation anymore, you are promised warmth with this product."
5,Good stuff,"Not only does this stuff smell great, but it actually works. There's not much else I could say about it."
1,This is just silly,"GARBAGE!This was given to me as a gift as Im known to head for the woods every other week--under dry conditions, zero wind, this product was an epic fail.Make your own and carry it in an altoids tin or similar but, preferably, cotton balls smeared in petroleum jelley.Pick both up at the Dollar store. Works FAR BETTER, you get a sustainable flame (1.5 min burn time with a 1.5"" flame) and obviously you spend less.You can also pack it in a small zip bag if you want to reduce as much weight as possible."
1,"Works, but get magnesium","This stuff works as advertised, but sadly, it is glorified kindling. Whatever tree they felled in the pristine jungles of the Amazon died needlessly.You're better off getting a block of magnesium for around the same price and much greater efficacy. Or if you're not starved for space, some cotton balls soaked in vaseline. Works just as well for a much lower price."
3,NOVELTY PACKAGING!!!,"This looked perfect for my daypack emergency kit. I actually bought this for the little snuff box, (who's gonna pay $4 for wood shavings?), turns out it holds only 1 oz. and it's PLASTIC! Under GOOD conditions that amount might start 2-3 fires. Had it been metal, adding an O-ring would keep it's contents dry. I could've got the sticks & made much more for same price!"
3,A little misleading..,"I bought this along with other things to put together a basic survival kit. I was expecting more, especially since the description used the word ""tin"" for what the Mayadust is contained in. The container is plastic and I could see it easily ""popping"" open inside my backpack with the moving around/etc activities. I'm actually thinking of putting it inside a plastic baggy or a rubber band around it just in case. Haven't actually used it yet so I can't say much on that part. In the end, I think i'd rather use a small METAL tin of some sort and use pencil shaving/cotton balls/etc as a firestarting base then buying this again. Nice novelty item essentially."
2,A Novelty Item at Best,I agree with other low ratings. There are several other things that can be used as starter fuel for fires. Two of mentioned else where that I have found better are: cotton balls and plain old dryer lint. Soak either in petroleum jelly and you have an excellent starter fuel.
2,Pointless!,"Originally a 3-part comic-book series in late 1997, Predator vs Judge Dredd is about...practically nothing! You think I am joking.The Pred lands on Earth. He stalks around Dredd's Megacity. He kills a few people. Dutch Schaefer's great, great grand-daughter is called in for her PSI skills. She drinks Predator blood. She telepathically knows where Pred is hiding. Dredd goes there and kills him. THAT'S IT!It's way too short for it's own good. There is no pathos. Slight humor. Bland artwork. A lame story and sudden, truncated ending. Why is Dutch's grand-daughter in it? What does that have to do with anything? Of all the crossovers and franchise blending this one has to be the most tepid. No effort was put into this whatsoever and it can be read from front to back in less than 10 minutes.A total waste of time!"
2,stupid idea,"First off, I liked the dredd flim and the predator comics so i read this one. I thought it was stupid. I mean do you think that Dredd 'the law' could defeat the best know hunter in the comic book galxey? I mean predator could blow dredd to pieces in a matter of seconds. Buy it if want it for a bad book collaction"
4,Great Item,I bought this as a gift for a 5 year old and she just loved it. She said it was the best gift she received!
4,Webkinz Alley Cat,"This is a cute and cuddly toy, with educational opportunities if entered to the site online."
4,Great value!,"My 9 year old daughter loves her Webkinz Alley Cat. She truly enjoys all the activities on the WebKinz website, and enjoys taking care of her kitty. As we only allow her a certain amount of time on the computer, she definitely has to plan her time well. Her Webkinz Alley Cat has proved to be time well spent. From planning how to spend her Webkinz cash to buy items for her kitty (has helped a lot with her developing math skills), as well as interracting with her other friends and their Webkinz on the Webkinz site has all been great fun. I am very pleased with the Webkinz product and highly recommend it."
5,Fun,This is so cuddly and fun to play with. I love this webkinz. I would play with it all day if I could.
3,Adequate hammer,"Nothing special about this. The spring that holds the chisel in broke on first use. Had to wait to use it until I could get a quick connect one on line. Not sure why the company would not include this for the price they are charging. Works adequately, not under powered but not overpowered either. Bought because reviews on this model were good. I guess I would say I do not agree wholeheartly with those folks."
4,Interesting movie,"I watched this movie on TV and I was very impressed. Lots of twists and turns, very enjoyable. Jennifer Lopez does a very good job in the movies, one of her best. I don't know why she was not mentioned in the review. I recommend it very highly."
4,Not Surprised,God book. It should be required reading in schools. I no longer have an excuse to continue to be a victim.
1,Kiddle version,Hey I'm sorry but i read this book and i loved it but what i can't stand is when the kindle price is set for more than the price of a hardback or paperback version. That just isn't right. It should be cheaper or at least match the lower priced version of a new copy of the book. Thats just wrong if it doesn't.
1,Sophomoric story signifying nothing,"Johnston revealed his lack of sophistication and understanding of our tax system and how we got to where we are now. A terrible misconstruction of events and misrepresentation of the facts. Events are taken out of context and the spin put on these events by Johnston is truly outrageous. Were you aware, Mr. Johnston, of what else was happening in our country, in our economy, in our culture, and within our government during the time frame when these events were taking place? What a waste of time."
5,The inside scoop,"As one who has been following David Cay Johnston's work for years in the newspaper, I am delighted that he has found a venue for laying out--in all its gruesome detail--how certain politicians, lobbyists and business leaders (enjoying great favor under the Bush Administation) have siphoned off America's middle class wealth to make the rich richer. This is a shocking story. Instead of wasting their time on talk shows and conspiracy theories, people should read the facts--just the facts--and make their reaction known through the political system. Are the Democratic candidates listening?"
4,David Cay Johnson's Bias,"Many have criticized this book for being anti-GOP. Just a note for you, Mr. Johnson is a registered Republican. However, he reserves the right to criticize both parties and will not blindly follow the party line like many Americans do.The book is fairly objective. No matter what side of the political spectrum (or the $87,000 S.S. cutoff line) you are, you will enjoy this investigation into what's wrong with our Social Security system and why a lockbox or any other panaceas will not save us!FYI: I am an independent but a conservative ideologically."
2,"This is about politics, not taxes or economics","I don't know much about David Cay Johnston (except this book), but I do know his employer, the New York Times, is about as stridently anti-GOP, anti-Bush as any publication out there. So, I'm not surprised to see no mention here about how the top 1% of earners pay more than a third of all income taxes, or that the top half pay almost 95%, but you CAN find that data on the IRS's own website. So, if these guys are rigging the tax system, they're doing a pretty poor job of it."
1,Pure Rubbish,Mr. Johnston's book is utter rubbish and was difficult to plod through. He simply mis-states facts and spews the leftist drivel currently on display by the democrats in this primary season. Fact: the top 20 percent of wage earners pay 80 percent of the taxes. I suggest a work by Milton Friedman or any reputable economist in place of this nonsense. Don't waste your money!
1,A very pompus book written by an un-informed author.,"This book is one of the worst to hit the market. It makes the point that it is the wealthy's job to pay for the poor. In fact this could not be farther from the truth. Shape it up Mr. Johnston. Do not buy this book at all costs, because the sales tax you pay may end up going to the ""Super-Rich"". Give me a break, what a terrible book."
5,Readable book on a difficult subject,"David C Johnston has written a really good, readable book on a topic most of us can't begin to understand. It's packed with information on how we got to this point, and what the consequences for all of us will be. What it is not: It is not an anti-business, anti-capitalist rant. It holds both political parties responsible, and so should we all. You may not agree with everything in it, but we all need to know and think about this."
4,Great stuff but repetitive.,"I think Marcelo is a great fighter and his style is exciting to watch. He shows some great details to his moves, however, he gives you about 16 moves per DVD and they are slightly different variation of the same move.I do recommend this series of DVD if you want to pay the price for about 6 different moves."
4,This one works for me,"I bought this item for it's small size and portability. I was able to assemble it within an hour. It fits into an otherwise unusable corner behind a door without interfering with entrance into the room. I just shut the door when I'm on the machine. It is lightweight enough to move if necessary. Upping the resistance is as easy as turning a knob. It comes with it's own simple to use computer with time, speed, distance and calories. For an exercise that targets your arms more - wear wrist weights.I have carpet and would recommend placing it on a hard surface if possible to make it more stable. I cut a board to fit underneath it.The noise is not an issue if you wear headphones while using the machine like I do. My machine is in my bedroom and I would not recommend riding it if you do not want to disturb someone who is sleeping."
4,Good,"I am wondering if I have the same Orbitrek Platinum as some of the people reviewing,I have owned an Orbitrek Platinum over two years nowand it works quite well and it certainly has not fallen apart.I use it for 30 minutes 4 days per week and have no major problems with it,granted it is not the quietest machine available,the noise is not loud enough to disturb someone in another room."
3,"""""B"""" grade shoes","If you read the product description closely it says they are """"B"""" grade shoes. Apparently Rockport did not want to sell them, so they wholesaled them out. I wish Amazon would put in the top listing that they are sub-par shoes which were rejected at quality control.I bought 4 different styles and returned 3 of them. All were ill fitting one pair didn't even match!!.But thank you Amazon for quick processing of my returns.!!!!I HAVE NEVER HAD THIS PROBLEM WITH ANYTHING I HAVE PURCHASED FROM AMAZON BEFORE."
4,Rockport Rocks...,I have been wearing this shoe for about 4 or 5 years now (new pair every year). I find it reasonably comfortable and am able to wear it casually and semi-casually. My only complaint is that the heels and soles wear out more frequently than other shoes I wear but that is the trade off for getting a good comfortable multi use shoe.
1,Way Overated!,"Rockport is supposed to be known for comfort, but these bad boys don't deliver. I suppose since Rockport got taken over by New Balance and then Adidas, quality is being sacrificed to boost the bottom-line.If you lift up the insole you will feel underneath it is like a piece of steel. There is literally no give to the shoe. I bought them thinking they were Rockports--known for quality--however Rockport isn't the same compnay today. I probably could get more comfort from a $30 pair of shoes in a baragin bin, then these overpriced clunkers!"
1,Fake or not fake?,"I have bought a Rockport Men's Northfield Oxford pair of shoes recently. I have known these shoes for about six years since I bought two pairs in London, UK. However when my order arrived from Amazon I noticed one thing immediately. The shoes were very stinky. (In UK they were not stinky at all.) I have been airing them since then. Another thing was discovered today. The shoes I bought in UK have a stamp, each of them. However, there is no stamp at all in the shoes bought from Amazon. I am very disappointed and I am not sure whether I bought a fake pair of shoes or not."
4,Nice western stories,"This succession of short stories adds even more pepper to these adventures typical western. Louis L'Amour is a great storyteller, adventurer, boxer, former tankiste during the Second World War, which ended his life owner of a ranch. It embodies perfectly alive the myth of the ""frontier""."
4,4 star,I had to return them because of wrong size. I would like to know if you have them at a size 40? Please let me know or tell me who I can contact to re-order the item. Thanks
5,Great Media Center PC,I bought this computer because I needed a fast CPU with lots of memory and a large HDD. The TV tuner with remote works great. I already had a video card with DVI-I out so I could hook it up to my 1080p HDTV. I bought this unit refurbished and it looks and operates as new. Only thing was 3 screws were rumbling around inside. I opened the system up and noticed they came from the MB. I immediately put them back and since then I've been in love.I have Netflix and I stream from Netflix using this computer directly to my HDTV. Another hickup that if you're looking into buying this computer is that I you'll need a good video card that outputs to a HDTV if you want HDTV functionality. The HP media center remote w/ hub are great. You can even put the system to sleep using the remote. It also has a IR bug for controlling cable boxes. One note: If you have Comcast Digital Cable using a Motorola HD-DVR with model line DCT the remote will not operate it.
1,beware,"dont waste your money. problems from the beginning- communication problem with monitor (2 different monitors). on the 2nd day of ownership- would not boot up. called hp- they sent me recovery discs. computer would not recover. called hp-sent box for repair. computer came back- replaced hard drive. still did not function correctly - periodic no communication with monitor.plus noticed a dent in the media card reader. calling hp (as i type with one hand-on hold waiting for supervisor for 90 minutes). requesting money back. up to now hp support was pretty good-no long holds, but this is terrible. save yourself the hassle."
2,Kids weren't interested,"I loved this toy when I was a kid, so I thought my kids would love it too. Well, it is hanging out with the other toys that they don't like. I guess in this age of technology kids just aren't as impressed with the manual toys. Save your money."
5,Great memories,"I remember this show when I was very young. The DVDs are a good quality version of the show. Keep in mind the special effects won't be the same as today, although it doesn't take away from the show for me. It deals with stories present at the time. The story ends up the main point with the ""bionics"" being just ""normal"" parts of the story - a good, seamless fit. The extras were interesting - I won't say too much there so as not to have a spoiler in the review."
5,Love it,I got an Amazon Gift card from Hubby and got very nostalgic w/ some buying some favorite old shows. I am so excited and happy about it!
5,Enjoyed watching this!,"Bionic Woman Season 3, along with Seasons 1&2 was so much fun to watch! Great to see that it is just as entertaining now as when I was a kid."
3,Missed Steve Austin,I enjoyed the first two seasons better than the last one. I enjoy the show because there is a connection to Six Million Dollar Man. He isn't even mentioned during this season and the story lines are very mystical and cheesy.
5,"Excelente, esta temporada me faltaba para completar mi colección. La recomiendo 100%",Me encantó. Recomiendo esta serie. Me llegó a tiempo y en excelentes condiciones. Soy coleccionista de series de antaño. Muy buena.
5,Nastalgic,"Got the item in 2 days. Haven't watched all episodes yet, but it really takes me back. Plan on doing more purchases from here."
3,Not AS Good AS The Other Two,"The only thing to recommend Season three of Bionic Woman I'm afraid is the Bionic Dog Maxamillion. It goes down hill from there. I think the loss of Kenneth Johnson, as well as Harve Bennett on Six Mill, plus no more crossovers makes the final season of Bionic Woman and the fifth season of Six Mill lose steam. As a true fan of both shows however, I still feel these two shows were the best on TV, and I feel very fortunate to have grown up when they were real heroes on TV like Steve and Jaime. I feel sorry for the kids today with only smut and violence to watch now a days."
5,The Bionic Woman Season 3,Was Great!! I enjoyed it a lot and now that it's on DVD I can watch it anytime I want!!
1,NOT FOR WOMEN!!!!!!,"I am a woman, and 1 year ago had triple By-Pass Open Heart Surgery....this book was definitely not targeted towards women....such a difference!!!!!! Your depression prior and after and the depressing book is awful...financially good for you but not very informative."
5,The Most Beautiful Book I Have Ever Read,"So simple yet so profound. I'm speechless. Thank you, Ben! or, rather, thank you, the SELF!"
2,DID NOT LIKE,"KIT DID NOT WORK ON REAR WHEELS I SPECIFIED MY CAR'S MAKE MODEL AND DESCRIPTION AND STILL GOT THE WRONG KIT, WILL THINK TWICE BEFORE ORDERING FROM THIS COMPANY AGAIN."
1,specialty products company 82120 camber adjustment kit,"I ordered this idem for my 2001 gt eclipse the box had several vehicles listed but not mine. My very competent mechanic told me this could not be fitted to my vehicle. So, this has not been a positive experience for me."
3,A very bland reading,Of the four available recordings of <Macbeth> this is the second tamest. The Macbeth sounds never less than the perfect English gentleman and what we have is a very dignified reading of a play that should be dripping with blood and shouted in thunder. Go either for the recording on Harper Audio or the one on Penguin (the Arkangel series). This Modern Library would make a poor choice.
2,SELECTIVE READING IN CD PLAYERS,"THESE CDR'S DO NOT WORK IN MULTI-DRIVE CD DUPLICATION TOWERS. FURTHERMORE, THEY ONLY READ IN MORE MODERN PLAYERS."
2,Not compatible with my Macbook,"These are great-looking, but aren't compatible in my Macbook which is a huge problem. The computer won't recognize these discs."
1,What a waste of time and money!!,"Horrible. The ""tips"" were common sense, and so many of the practice questions were blatantly wrong. When the answers actually matched up with the questions, the ""correct"" answers and the explanations were highly debatable (Who would say a CROS is the best choice for a bilateral high frequency SNHL??). Don't buy this. Kay T. Payne should pay me for the time I wasted even opening this book."
1,The worst book ever,"The characters were unlikeable, and I didn't care what happened to them. The storyline was awful, and it was painful to read. It was a bad start and continued to get worse throughout the book. Do not read this, do not buy it."
2,"Yeah, what he said","Just to reiterate what the last reviewer said: This is not a book of solos. It will sound horribly thin without accompaniment, so unless you want a play with trios or are willing to work in some bass lines on your own, this isn't the book for you."
5,A must.,This should be considered required materialfor anyone studying the idiom of jazz.I can't think of anyone of merit playingthat hasn't stolen from the genius of Bill Evans' voicings.Learn from the best....
3,Informational,"Definitely a college/graduate level read. If you're really into studying Philosophy & Theology, this is for you. Otherwise you may not like it. a little more challenging of a read but highly educational and informational"
5,Higher Quality then other mounts I found,"I needed this for an older Sharp 65"" LCD, it has a bolt pattern that is wider and most of the other brackets I found would not work. Thismount had thicker metal and better hardware than the cheaper mounts. Installed without a problem. Don't rely on those bubble levelsbuilt into some mounts I used on and the mount was crooked. This worked like a charm with my 65"" Sharp LCD."
3,has great potential!,"I loved the idea of this diaper bag! I wish the shoulder strap stayed attached but tucked away or something and the stroller straps stayed put also. You do need an extra hand to undo one and put back on the other strap. The bag is very tall an narrow so you have to creatively get everything in and make sure it goes back in the same way, (which we all know doesn't happen with a baby). The bag does tip over b/c the bottom is so narrow, and it does not close if there is even one extra burp cloth in the top.I do not regret getting this bag at all b/c I love that it attaches to the stroller and you do not have to stick it under underneath. Especially for peg-perego strollers where the under the stroller bag is kind of hard to get big items in and out of. It does not look like a typicall ""baby"" diaper bag, and it does carry the basics (diapers, wipes, change pad, bottle and baby food), but it does need some more work."
2,Excellent quality but...,"Way too tall and deep for my tastes. Does not hold much, the whole top half is useless. When i set it down on the floor it always tips over just because the bottom is so narrow. A pain to switch between stroller staps and single strap, easier to just pick one way of using it and leave it be. I'm thinking of exchanging mine for the Dash."
1,Exterior pockets lack security,"You have to be careful with the exterior pockets because i used the side pocket to store my cel phone (i beleive its the designed cell phone pocket) and i was at a crowded event and my cel phone was stolen from this pocket which was secured only by a magnet and i didnt notice until i needed the phone which was minutes after the robbery. I recomend to use the inside pockets to store valuables, dont risk exterior pockets for anything that is not for your babys needs. I have a new baby and i hoped this bag would fit both my baby's and my 3 year old needs and it's not feasable. I just purchased a DadGear Backpack Diaper Bag and we'll see how that works out."
5,Love it!!,I disagree with the review below. I made a batch of white chocolate brownies and flavored them with this and I definite tasted cotton candy and so did my husband. I put about 6 drops in for a 9x13 pan.
5,Good product,This product is great. It smells and tastes like cotton candy. Just what I was needing and expecting it to be.
2,Not what I expected,This was a flavor I was excited to try. I was disappointed when I didn't taste cotton candy. My cake pops tasted sweeter than normal but did not have the cotton candy taste. I would not recommend this flavor.
5,Yummy!,"I got this just in time for my kids' birthday parties. I flavored their cakes' icing with the cotton candy & another with the bubble gum flavor. We liked the cotton candy more & my daughter was so happy with her cake & kept telling everyone that her cake's icing was cotton candy flavored. A little goes a long way, I used about a 1/4 tsp for one batch of icing."
3,A strong premise but not a great book,"What if a teenage lover dies tragically? What if the haunting memory of ""coulda, shoulda"" has plagued you for over 20 years? And what if, someone appears in your life with the same name, similar interests, and personality traits of that long, lost love? Meet Louise Harrington, an admissions coordinator at Columbia, who believes her deceased childhood sweetheart serendipitiously has returned to her. Sounds like the making of a fabulous book, right? WRONG!!! Schulman rambles page after page with trivial details, yet the characters never become three-dimensional. The protagonist's ex-husband, Peter, has issues of his own which never get addressed. Throw in Louise's troubled brother Sammy and her dysfunctional relationship with her mother, and the humor and irony which should be apparent, never really appear. It should have been a prolific read, but it was just OK."
5,Great start and communication from Rick,"I recently purchased all of the available Pros2Joes books and this one companion DVD. For someone trying to get familiar with SQL, and if you appreciate seeing and hearing over reading, this is a huge plus. I am a fan of the Joes2Pros SQL products. In addition, I will say that I had a few questions so I sent an email to the author Rick, he got back to me within 24 hours and has done so now on a few more occassions. Seems like a quality product by a quality professional."
5,SQL Made Easy,"Books - T SQL 2008 and SQL Queries and SQL Architecture BasicsI have been lucky to have this series of books recommended to me. I searched for a quality uncomplicated guide to enable me to understand SQL Server and Joes 2 Pros is my Eureka moment. Clear explanations, clear examples and well explained that leaves me totally confident to start my new job. Their accompanying website has all the answer scripts and videos explanations for all required. As an aside, I contacted Joes to Pros asking a question.

1,Dreadful sludge,"This CD is absolute poo, mainly due to the amateur musicianship of Jeff Lauras. Avoid at all costs"
4,No pressure,"This isn't really a how to book. Its more of a tip guide. Very short and easy to follow. The writer does give you a idea of what supplies you will need to start (paper and writing utensil, really that's all you need) and some ideas about where to go.I found it to be useful in the sense that undertaking something like this can be very intimidating and the author makes it seem everyday.A good book."
5,50 Christmas Years in Review,"50 years ago I started writing Christmas letters when my son, Scott was born. Kept all the pictures and letters in a drawer. Then approximately 10 years ago....I found this great book of Christmas remembrances. Then I took photoshop. This finally allowed me to retype the letters, add additional photos and the result was a compilation of my children's lives and mine. Made a ""Book 1"" for my 3 children, myself, and my Ex-husband. I then started a ""Book 2"" with my 2nd husband, Hollis who passed away in 2001, and kept it going until this year when I had to order another ""Book 3"", to continue with my journey through this life with another wonderful friend and partner, Jay. Altogether I have made 7 ""Chirstmas Books"" for my posterity. I have loved every Christmas and look forward all year long to the pictures that I will use to depict that year in review. Anyone would treasure this Christmas book!!!"
4,My girlfriend likes it,I bought this because my girlfriend encouraged me to. She saw it in a store and liked the smell. Other women have noticed it and made favorable comments about it.
5,"Good Features, but 10 miles, dream on.","1) Clear signal.2) SCRM mode - real privacy mode, not a filter like other radios.3) NOAA alert - really works. Checks NOAA every 7 seconds.4) Volume controls right under fingers.5) Better charger options (direct or base) than other radios.6) Orange Color - easy to find in backpack.7) Good price.Complaints - 10 miles, dream on. 2-3 actual, but all radiosclaim 10 miles, delivering 2-3."
1,Disappointing,"DisappointingThese walkie-talkies disappointed in these two areas:1. Living in an area that only has buildings 2-floors in height, I could not getthese Walkie-talkies to transmit any further then only ONE MILE.I truly didn't expect to get the manufacturers claim of a 10-mile range,but I expected at least 7 miles, or 5 miles... not ONE MILE.2. The sound quality on these units is rather poor. The person on the other end sounds muffled.A serious 2-way radio? Not this unit.Buy it as a toy instead."
2,Nice features but ...,"Radios have nice features, but i have tried them in the city and during travel and they don't reach 1 mile, so it is far away from the 10 miles they said it reach."
3,"Novel design, but $100??? *laughs*","First off, I'm amazed they could make this without getting sued into oblivion by Nintendo. I remember when they tried to copyright ""start and select"" I can't remember if they lost or won that case. This pad is for Playstation (it even has the two analog sticks as well as the 2 L's and R's) but it's made to look like the old 8-bit NES pads. Novel concept, and I'd buy it to use with my Lik-Sang adapter (to play emulators on my pc) but I wouldn't pay $100 for it, you'd be lucky to get me to pay $12. The old NES pad design was cramped, definately not ergonomic. Hey, here's an idea... why not re-make Turbo Touch 360? I'd much rather have a touch panel with perfect diagonal than a blister-inducing D-pad. Make Turbo Touch 360's for Playstation, THEN I'll be impressed."
5,Easy as 1 2 3,"Man, can clean up get any easier? not with this I have made the biggest mess using this machine, all I do is pop out the grids throw into the dishwasher and they come out looking brand new a Person wonders why it took so long for this concept to catch on"
2,Too small,Had to send it back. Thought I perhaps ordered the wrong size. The band was way too small and this is the size I always buy. Disappointed. Looks really nice.
5,My favorite maker of Bras,"Great fit, and color. This is one of my favorite styles that Playtex offers without the wire, very comfortable and stylish."
4,Good bra,"Fits well, and is comfortable. I don' like wired bras, they jab me in the ribs. So this one was nice. I would buy this again, it came in good condition also."
4,not bad...,"This is a pretty, well made bra but a titch on the snug side. Hoping it will relax a titch. Band size is good but shoulder straps are a bit short so it rides up. Good support though."
3,Playtex Secrets bra,"I like the style of this bra, but the size is too small and very uncomfortable. I am returning it."
2,Side smoothing?,"This arrived in a short time, which is good. But I ordered up one size and could barely fasten it. I think it might be a decent bra if I could figure out what size I need but won't try guessing and having too many returns."
3,Comfee bra,Comfortable - sizing right one to the charts given so it was easy to order and get the size that fits.
2,Not as expected,"From this view it looks like the bra covers side boob. It doesn't. The photos of the smaller-breasted models have side angles so you can see exactly how much coverage the bra provides. In this photo the woman is bigger on top, and because the woman I purchased the bra for is bigger on top, I used this photo and this model to decide whether or not the bra would cover and support to the recipient's liking/needs. Sometimes for larger cup sizes extra support is added. I really thought that would be the case when she received it because, in my opinion, this photo is misleading. The recipient is very unhappy, as am I. If anyone reading this comment could recommend a bra that covers side boob, and is wireless and comfortable, I would greatly appreciate it. This was a waste of my money. Compare this photo to the photos of the smaller-breasted models."
2,Poor quality nipples,"I rescued two kittens from the side of the road and guessed they were between 3-4 weeks old. I bought this nursing bottle kit for the kittens and the nipples lasted one feeding each. Three nipples-three feedings. It also took me about a half hour to puncture the nipple because you want the liquid to be able to flow but not too much where it causes aspiration. The bottle itself was good but the nipples are not very strong. The kittens gnawed on the nipples while feeding, causing the rubber to completely come apart. These babies barely have teeth, none in the front, so I am very disappointed in this product. The only time I would use this product is if your kittens are 0-2 weeks old. Once their teeth come in, forget it."
1,Poor quality construction.,"The base of this sander is made of thin aluminum which can be very easily bent. The sander I received was so badly bent it was unuseable. I have been told there are replacement bases made by a different company that are very sturdy, but they cost thirty dollars.If I had a chance to see how this sander is constructed I would not have ordered it."
5,great straight line sander,"I used sanders for over 30 years ,this one is great for the money, well worth it.runs fast and smooth,can't beat it.A must buy,THE INGERSOLL RAND 315 HEAVY DUTY AIR TWIN PISTON STRAIGHT LINE"
1,Awful,"I am writing this review as I look to replace this awful vacuum cleaner.I bought this 1 1/2 years ago on the Consumer Reports recommendation. I was going to buy a dyson, but CR gave it a pretty average review, and gave this one a best buy. It was terrible from the get-go, and expensive, about $350, and I should have returned it right away. I had a Eureka that lasted for years before it finally gave out.The belts fall off at least once a month. The bag takes 8 months to fill....not a great testiment to its power. It's heavy, and plastic pieces have broken off of it, so that I can't wrap the cord in any meaningful way. Now the brush isn't spinning, and the vacuum is picking up nothing.I'm done trying to coddle this piece of junk, and can't wait to put it in the trash."
1,No longer Hoover quality,"We bought our Hoover vacuum 3 years ago. The vacuum was good, but not any better than my grandmother's ancient model. It now has sparks flying out of the motor and has ruined my kitchen and bathroom floor. Hoover used to symbolize quality. I will not be buying another Hoover. 300$ is a lot of money to pay for a disposable item."
1,defective,I purchased this vacuum form Amazon a year ago. It now deposit dirt into the attachment hose instead of the bag. It also produce a strange smell when it is operating. Since Wal-Mart now sells vacuum for $40. I don't even think it is worth my time to get this vacuum fixed. I am extremely disappointed by this product.
4,Good product,"So far we are quite pleased with our new Self Propelled Windtunnel Vacuum. It is our second one. We were pleased with the number of years the first one lasted, especially since we have always had dogs in the house and there is never a shortage of dog hair to be vacuumed."
4,"A good, traditional vacuum","My family has purchased Windtunnels for years and they have always proved to be a good vacuum overall. They are not the most reliable, but most problems are typical of an upright. Drive belt, bulb and occasional clogs.The self-propelled feature is a 'must-have' for plush carpet. Always a lot of suction power from the detachable hose for those odd jobs. I recently ordered an additional vacuum for a business."
2,Just not the same,I was in the market for a new vac & have had 2 of these with extreme delight in the past 16 years. This one came broken and much to my disappointment I will not get another one. The factory non-800 phone line would not send me another belt to fix the one I received(already broken). They only said send it back or take it 25 miles to the service center. I will be buying something else.
2,Disappointed,"I bought the vacuum in Feb. 2007 because I wanted one with the self-propelled feature. I had only used it once or twice when it started making a horrible noise. It worked fine, however.I recently discovered that the off/on switch had stopped working. Fortunately, it was in the on position, so it could start and stop it by plugging it in.Than the self-propelled feature stopped working. I decided to try changing the flat belt, which operates that feature. After some struggle, I was able to get the old one off, but there is no way I will ever be able to get the new one on. The manual says ""extra effort may be required to stretch the belt onto pulley."" That is an understatement.I live 150 miles away from the nearest authorized service center. I'm wondering if it is worth fixing at this point."
1,ABSOLUTE PIECE OF GARBAGE!,"I have never had a vacuum that had so many problems. I tossed this vacuum after just seven months. Belts constantly broke, operates very noisy, roller brush rattles, and on-off switch wouldn't turn off anymore (could only use the plug). Don't waste your money! This vacuum has horrible reviews. I had prior models that were not nearly as bad. I am done with Hoover and Windtunnel. Got a Eureka Boss for much less and its a far better machine."
1,Best suck for the buck,"I'm very pleased with this purchase. I bought it for a friend who has a labrador that stays in the house, and this keeps all the doghair in the bag where it belongs. Great suction, easy to handle and at a price I could afford."
2,"It is a beast! And doesn't work well, either.","This thing weighs a ton and is NOT easy to carry up and down stairs even though it has a carry handle built into it.If it didn't have a self-propel feature, you wouldn't be able to push it!And it is very messy to empty the dirt cup. What's the point of all that hepa filtration if a cloud of dust escapes from the cup when emptying it?I was having mechanical problems with it after 3 years, so I bought a new vacuum recently, and found out that my new Bissell sucks up TONS more dirt than this one ever did. It made me realize that a heavier ""smarter"" vaccuum didn't mean it could do a better job."
1,Very disappointed - DONT BUY,"We had a Hoover that died on us after 10 years. Since our old vacuum worked so well we bought this vacuum over two years ago. The first few months it worked very well but it fell apart in the first year. The power button doesn't work (won't shut off), the self propel button doesn't work, and the brushes won't spin on our new shag carpet. We are constantly repairing it. Don't buy!!!"
5,Wonderful Vacuum,1st let me say that I ordered this vacuum on a Sunday evening and had it on Tuesday with the free shipping. Wonderful!!!As for the vacuum it does a wonderful job. Picks up everything. Not overly loud. The roller brush works great on steps.Overall works great.
1,Bad deal for me,"I used this vacuum just twice when the beater bar froze. Problem was, the 30 day return to Amazon had expired because I went on extended vacation (I expressly bought from Amazon because of this and thought I would be better protected). They refused to help beyond answering my initial email to tell me they wouldn't help!From now on, I'll be purchasing items such as this from a local merchant (Wal*Mart) who will repair or replace.:-("
2,Poor quality control,"This vacuum broke within several months after I bought it this spring--the on switch would not turn off. The manager of the store where I bought it said they had returned this model, as well. I will not buy Hoover vacuums again. This is the third Hoover vacuum cleaner that has been poorly made that I've bought in the past five years. One (a canister Hoover) had an attachment with a plastic connector that broke every six months, and I ordered replacement nozzles by the batch. Another was so loud we could not live with it and returned it. This one was heavy and did not even last five months. I think quality control at Hoover must not be what it used to be. I've switched to a Miele canister, which is great."
2,Damaged my hard wood floors,"I don't see that anybody else complained about this, but I think it's worth mentioning. I used it on my hard wood floors, on the correct setting... and it immediately chomped out two big chunks of hard wood flooring!! I basically screamed and picked it up as fast as I could. It was too late. I checked everything on it, and it seemed fine. It continued to work great on carpet, but I wasn't dumb enough to try it on the hardwood floors again. Maybe it was a random defect, but if you have nice hardwood floors, or like them without chunks missing I wouldn't take my chances with this one. The hand tool is a great idea, but hair and gunk gets wrapped around the spinners and it stops working. I tried cleaning it out, but it didn't seem to help."
1,Windtunnel,"When the machine is working, it actually cleans very well. This is my 4th one in seven years. YES 4th one. Works great when first new, after that it is all DOWN hill from there. I should have bought stock in Hoover just to pay for them and all the repairs. I did a comparison with my sisters-in-laws (3) of them. 1 was a Kirby other was a elcrolux (sp) and the third was a Dyson. My one sil's Dyson has been hers for the past 5 years. She has no problems with it. I went with the Dyson DC18 and it does a FANTASTIC job."
2,Not good for bare floors,"Have had 2 great Hoovers in the past 7 years, but this one is terrible on wood floors. Does okay on carpet. The attachments are all convenient and easy to use.If you are buying to use on hard surfaces, I'd get something different. It won't even pick up a staple or grain of rice off the wood floor -- just not enough suction."
2,Disappointed after a year,"I have owned this vacuum a little over a year. Initially, the vacuum cleaner was great. I purchased it after reading consumer reviews. However, after two weeks, the plastic switch that changes the vacuum from carpet to bare floor broke--this was fixed for free at the vacuum cleaner shop where I purchased the item. Now that I am no longer under warranty, the on/off switch does not work and neither does the self-propelled switch. An employee at the vacuum cleaner shop says that happens frequently because the switches are plasitc and it's between 40 and 50 dollars to get it fixed. I asked why the Hoover Wind Tunnel is rated so high and he said it's because the motor is good. Needless to say, I am looking to purchase a different brand of vacuum cleaner."
2,Can you say LOUD?,"After owning a Kirby for years but getting tired of how heavy it was dragging it up and downstairs we decided to try something lighter. This vacuum does clean well but holy cow it is loud. It's so loud it scares our dogs, birds, cat and my kids! It doesn't seem to matter if it's on carpeting or a wood floor. It's just loud and obnoxious. I just hate using it and won't buy another Hoover again. Get some ear plugs if you buy it."
1,Jesus H.Christ,It is a damn good thing that I cannot get this authors e mail address The ONLY thing this book is good for is aggravating my shoulder injury as I throw it out of my library in a fit of total RAGE!
3,I couldn't finish watching,"While the director of this film deals with events that probably happen often, the way that the story is told is relentlessly downbeat. It is hard to imagine that the people the hustlers represent have no good days. I had to stop watching after Marek injures himself in a fit of dispair. I couldn't bear any more.Some people who pay for sex are abusive and some people who think they can make porn movies treat the models badly. If you think nobody should hustle or be in a porn movie that's fine. However if you are going to tell a story to get that point across then it isn't wise to go from scream-fest to drugged rape to beating then betrayal and so on without a break.The performances were exactly right. I did not feel like I was watching actors but real people. That added to the horror. Unlike other reviewers I did not feel the quality of the transfer was a problem."
4,Mandragora - a MUST see DVD!,"This movie left me gasping for air! It's a movie that forces you to see life from a young male hustlers point of view. There were times during the movie where I just wanted to reach into my screen and protect Mark and David from the perversions surrounding them. The tragic part of all this is, the movie is not based on fantasy, but rather on reality that young male hustlers face everyday in the real world."
1,Long and Bleak,"As indignity upon indignity is heaped on our protagonist, one gets a distinct whiff of self-loathing if not actual homophobia in this depiction of a young gay man's exploitation in the big city. Mandragora is way too long, relentlessly bleak and only has a couple of novel cinematic tricks to spark a bit of interest."
3,Sad indeed....,"It's a very honest and sad ""documentary"". It reflects a side that's quite similar to the lives of the go-go boys at Bangkok. Worth viewing."
2,heavy wording,"i like the idea of the book but it doesnt deliver what it says. it seems to be pretty liberal so far, and although it has high claims which sound nice, i am not impressed by the content of the book itself. at page 70 now. i find it difficult to read because the person uses difficult language and think it will not be easy for the majority of Muslim women to read, as delightful as the philosophy of self-knowledge and identity are within Islam, this book is a bust (so far). Very disappointing."
3,It works but not reliable.,"It does as advertised over a 100' ethernet wire but I have to reconnect it, unplug and re-plug, wiggle, etc., every few weeks to get it to work again. The PC keeps losing the connection to the USB appliance while using this extender. It works fine without the extender. So yes it works but it is finicky. Not at all like plugging straight into a USB port the normal 6' way."
1,Ooops..Ankit Fadia did it again!,"I am going to throw my two cents in! I agree with Ashely M (From Australia) that the initial three reviews are written by Ankit Fadia. They all have written only one review so far in Amazon.com and gave 5 stars.I have read Fadia's book before, and being an IT analyst, I can tell you that whatever he writes is crap and does not have any practical knowledge. It's very easy to write a book like that, because all you have to do is spend couple of months on Google, copy information from website, and paste it on your Word processor, edit it, and give it to publisher. However, the only hard work Fadia's does is choosing a good title for a book.This book is as bad as his earlier book. Don't buy and waste your $50 on this crap, instead donate it to Greenpeace or CRY.As said by one of the reviewers, I have to give one star as that is the least."
1,Highly Overrated,"I'm not sure what's up with all the great previous reviews. My guess is the writers of those reviews aren't extremely knowledgable in network security.This book is riddled with inaccuracies, ranging from completely and absolutely wrong statements to misleading information. I never got through more than 5 pages without finding another instance of misleading or incorrect information.The author's age - 17 years old - most definitely shows. He comes off as more of a ""script kiddie"" than anything. He obviously doesn't have the in-depth security, networking, and systems knowledge that a true security expert with a number of years of real world experience would have.On the positive side, it does have some good information, but not valuable nor significant enough to make up for the amount of bad info.I'd look elsewhere - this is definitely not a book I'd recommend."
5,Larger Set Saved Me Money!!!!,"I love these wrenches, I use them every day. There is not one size I haven't used and I've only had the set for a month. The greatest feature has to be the reversible lever, I use it constantly especially for really tight places. My only disappoinment is the offset, sometimes the nut you need to remove doesn't give you that much clearance. I'm very happy that I bought the 16-piece set though. This is a great set and I highly recommend it to anyone who wants good high quality ratcheting wrenches."
5,One Happy Reader,These essays are so true to life. The variety of themes and down-to-earth reactions make them a joy to read. R. Mula 's book leaves you with an upbeat feeling.
5,A Close Call for Bostom Blackie,"Really Enjoyed this old classic mystery. It is a lighthearted mystery and I love the vintage era with the cars and buildings, clothing."
2,It started off good...,"... but then it all went downhill.. I bought this product as a Christmas gift for my boyfriend. We host bi-weekly poker nights and thought this would be a great alternative to a big metal case. The idea was great, but the quality of this product was awful. The handle fell off before we could even use it.. after investigation, it was due to stripped screws. The lid broke because the wood it was made out of was so flimsy. There are other products out there that are much better quality than this one."
2,Incorrect Product Description!,"1) While these will technically fit the thicker 40GB iPod, they were actually designed for the thinner 20GB - they will protect the 40GB device equally as well, however the openings for the scroll wheel and the screen will stretch out of shape. (This is not the seller's fault - the manufacturer's packaging claims that it will fit the 40GB)2) The claim ""Comes with 3 iPod jackets, each with a lanyard"" is factually incorrect. There is only 1 lanyard included for the 3 skins - this is clearly visible from the unopened package, so I lay the blame on the seller (who presumably wrote the copy for the Amazon page)They are a good value at the current price of $.99 - however they are not as described - thus my 2 star review."
4,"Relevant topic material, well organized","The book was very well organized, and very client-centric. I thought the detail of survey results was used well to bridge the chapters. A very relevant topic in today's fast-paced selling environment"
5,Good indices!,I bought this set for a student who is a beginner in design. They guide you through your design in the most meaningful way. They even come in a very cute case!Colorindex is the one I love most because it allows you to search for the particular combination of colors that gives your design the particular feel. It is the one good to have even if you don't get the whole set.
5,Take the plunge,"After borrowing my friend's book of color designs for nearly a year while redecortating my house, I finally took the plunge and bought the boxed set. I use the colors book the most, but the other two also have interesting combinations and design ideas. They are full of need to know information including how to be aware of what you are saying or emphasizing with your layouts. Wonderfully put together, these books will be useful to the beginner or the ultra experienced. And they come in their own cool box."
4,"Content notwithstanding, some little nits to pick","Great ideas and good reference content. However... I am not carrying these volumes around in my purse or pocket, I'm using them as a reference at my desk so I find the size (about 4""x6"") distracting from their readability. Lots of page turning, holding out at arms length, and they don't lay flat. Also, I'd rather pay a few dollars less and not get the twee little clear plastic suitcase they came in that I don't have a use for and will feel guilty just throwing away. Like I said, it is picking nits, but that's all that keeps the rating from being 5-star."
5,why do i need a title for this review?,"This is an amazing set of books for anyone who is even considering going into graphic design. The books cover everything you could want from color theory and schemes, to grid structure, graphic effects and all kinds of typographic treatments. The books have helped to inspire some of my own personal designs since i received them and i plan to reference them for many projects in the future. This is an amazing value for the money i spent!"
5,valuable resource,I am a design student and use these books on an almost daily basis. While some aspects of them are some what simple as long as you are not going to be using these books to get ideas but rather improve upon an existing idea that you already have then these books are great. Overall there are definitely other books out there that will do the same thing but they wont be able to do it as quickly or as easily.
5,Great Ideas,"These books are small and handy enough to stick into a small bag, and the ideas in them are great. Whenever you are stuck and need an idea to get you jumpstarted, these books are a great go-to."
1,Badly designed book about graphic design,"Lured in by the dozens of glowing reviews, I chose to ignore my doubts stemming from the clunky 90's looking cover design. ""Don't judge a book by it's cover""... except when it's a book about graphic design, it turns out.I am a professional graphic designer and was hoping this could be a quick resource for layout options and day-to-day design dilemmas - but this set of books is totally useless for anyone but a total beginner and I urge you not to waste your money like I did."
2,What's with the good reviews?,"I don't get it? I bought the book based on the reviews, and I was very dissapointed. What is the point of this set? There's nothing here. Just some outdated designs and basic principles. I don't get the point. This may have been great 5-10 years ago, but now its just outdated."
2,not quite the same,i just wanted to play the greatest game ever made...but it took forever to get it going and the game doesnt work that well..its very sketchy...even when you have it at the lowest resolution possible...plus even though its in hd it doesnt look any better...i wouldnt buy the hd version...
1,An Island Garden,"This was a poorly made copy of the original book without the famous illustrations by Childe Hassam. I was disappointed in the book, but the seller made good by refunding my money."
2,poor quality,"I chose this rating because the picture on cover has nothing to do with where this took place, and the print was very poor. Also the quality of cover and paper was below average... not good at all."
3,A Passionate Gardener,"Celia Thaxter tried poetry and fiction, but it is hardly a surprise that this book carries her mark on literature today. A woman possessed by the beauty of flowers, she planned and nurtured her garden year after year on a windswept island off the Atlantic coast of Maine and New Hampshire. Her friends and visitors included a small group of distinguished artists and authors. To those not terribly interested in flower literature, An Island Garden will impress anyway by the sheer passion and stamina of the author."
4,Nice introdcution to analysis,I am glad that Dover has added this book to their offerings. This is a nice introduction to analysis. I happen to like Hoffman's writing style. It seems very clear to me. Readers may also want to read Linear Algebra by Hoffman and Kunze. Linear Algebra by Hoffman and Kunze is considered to be a classic text by many applied mathematicians. This analysis book is written in a similar manner.
5,Great starter Bible for Kids!,"This is a great starter Bible for Kids. It has the full Bible text as well as shorter, paraphrased Bible stories and beautiful illustrations."
3,Okay product,"This Bible is okay. I bought it for my two year old, which is the audience I thought is was intended for. However, it seems to be more appopriate for maybe a five to ten year old. There are some shorter type stories you can read to a toddler, but not very many. I will keep it for her to use when she is older."
1,Blurred Images,"My son received this item as a gift. I saved it for night time when he was sick and couldn't sleep. And boy were we disappointed! It is impossible to focus the images. You can get a very small circle in the center focused, but everything else is very blurred. I tried different reels, moved it forward and back but nothing helped. I plan to find somewhere to return it for another item."
4,What a pleasure!,"Okay. First, you need to know that I've read this book about three dozen times. Obviously, I love it. The characters so well developed and Dexter provides judicious helpings of magic and humor.Leith, the title character of the novel, is a likeable but hapless young man who is cursed with two different color eyes, which makes him an outcast. His companion, Lady Kess is ruthless and not above taking advantage of Leith. Finally, there is the horse, Valadan, who has plenty of personality of his own.The book is about quests, relationships, fate, magic, and all of that. It has both humor and emotional weight. It reads like classic fantasy and is highly engaging."
3,Kess - the terrible,"I did enjoy this book and I enjoyed the prince's character very much. Very rarely will you find a fellow who has such wonderful manners and constraint despite all that ails him. I, however, loathed Kess. There is no doubt she is a strong female presence, She was bitter, contempuous, heartless, selfish...I could go on and on. Even in the end she never really redeemed herself. I'm positive that the prince's worst luck of all is that he didn't dump the ""wonderful"" princess on her behind in a desert somewhere. Kess ruined a very good reading experience. The book gets three stars for the prince...I wish him well."

5,Fiesta Chip-n-Dip Set Christmas Gift,"The Fiesta Chip n Dip set, arrived on time for Christmas, was packed extremly well, and in excellant condition. Thank you."
1,Junk product,"This is an inferior product. I mean really inferior. Irregular, dusty chips. Dirty fingerprints; they seemed manually packed in very bad conditions. Cheap aluminium case. *Do not* make this a present to anyone, it will be an embarrassment. While the seller refunded me for the product, I didn't get a refund for shipping -- which is more than half of the product cost.I wish I can recommend you where to go for a good chip set. Tried other vendors and got the same kind of junk. I suspect most those chips come from a common source. Some companies sent me samples; then when the order arrived nothing looked like the samples. I was duped."
5,Great chips!,I had no idea what to buy (this was a gift) and asked a friend for advice. This is what she recommended. They are great and my husband is very pleased with them. They came quickly and in great shape. Thank you!
4,Sturdy frame,"I ordered this futon for an extra place to sit in the nursery. The instructions were not the best but all of the parts were in the packaging and we just figured it out from there. This is definitely a two person job. The sturdy wood is very heavy duty. The reason it didn't get five stars is because I had to re-drill two of the holes, they did not line up. Once the holes were redrilled, putting the futon together was a snap. My son slept on it and it didn't even creek. I am impressed with this product."
2,i really wanted to like it...,"i first read this book when i was in junior high and i thought it was good. when i saw it on here for a couple of dollars i thought 'why not?' when i received the book and flipped through it i realized the only thing i liked was the artwork. there isn't very much useful content. i guess it was okay when i was a teenager, but going through it now...it's just so one sided, the author even calls the sun god boring! i'm glad i only spent a couple of dollars on this because it's not worth much more than that."
1,Book Feedback,"There are some interesting points made in the book; however, the information within the book is biased towards advising companies to outsource the IT Department and advising the readers that a majority of the problems that are encountered in a business are a result of the IT Department. The information overall is old. The book does not promote a Win/Win approach."
1,Please don't buy this book,"This book is Godawful. The only reason I read it was because it was assigned. The entire plot seems to consist of spontaneous reasons for the characters to have sex with each other. As far as historical accuracy goes, since when was Hamlet a girl? Please don't waste your time. PLEASE don't buy this published fanfic."
4,Lighten up,"The Field Guide to White People is a great book for people to laugh at themselves along with other overly stereotyped groups. If you the reader cannot handle satire, then you are both very stupid and not fit to read this book. Enjoy this book for what it is- a joke. Don't expect a great literary piece with this, but don't be offended by the obviously harmless classifications of white people. For those who were offended by this book, I'm sorry for your friends and family because obviously you have no sense of humor and are not fun to be around. I would definitely recommend this book."
3,Very Funny,"Number one, this book was nto meat to purposley stereotype anyone. It's was meant for plain fun. I noticed how I am much somebody really tries to make a book of humor. Even though I didn't agree with totaly everything in the book, it is plain humor and fun, very funny!"
1,no stars,"Amazing what passes for humor these days. I found this to be full of vicious stereotypes that would not be acceptable if they were applied to any other group of people. Not funny, cute, or even mildly entertaining."
5,You'll love this book more than you love Johnny Cakes,"''l love you Johnny Cakes'' is what Joey G. is best known for. But after reading this book, you'll think you're on the 0rient Express chasing a killer than a bed & breakfast in New Hampshire chasing a hunky biker with a knack for making that special breakfast. Now that ''Fat Vito'' is dead, maybe Joey G. will become the next Mickey Spillane."
2,So so,"Not so good. I bought it for 3 reasons, my husband is an Italian-American, I love to cook and I love the Sopranos. Dissapointing."
5,love it and would buy it again,We bought this for our second daughter on her first birthday. She loved it and played with it consistently for nearly two years and so did her big sister. Definately buy it! Never had a problem with it. So worth the money.
1,Horrible toy,"This Product was terrible for the price. It takes a lot of batteries which only last for about fifteen minutes if the child is steadily playing with it. If you leave it on, the batteries drain within minutes. The on/off switch is on the bottom which makes it hard to turn off once you have stored all the blocks away. It only works with the enclosed blocks, not any of the other companion block. You are better off buying the Giraffe or the Elephant to play with. They don't eat batteries only blocks."
2,Thought it would be more interesting for 1-year old!,"This toy is boring and not well assembled! I purchased this $50 toy because I thought it would be educational for our daughter - sticking blocks in holes, and a variety of other fun things to do with blocks! Not so. The ""special block"" on the top only announces its name as you press the button, and the revolving spinny thing (on our model) is grinding, after only 7 days of play. The side that you drop the blocks into (the storage container looking thing) keeps opening, so not all the blocks actually stay in, and I agree with a previous reviewer....you can only drop 6-8 blocks into the ""lever"" side before they all dump out. Not worth the money!"
2,what a boring toy,"We bought this for our Daughter and the most she has ever played with it is 2 minutes at a time.The top is not really interactive and only spins,when you take a block and put it in the middle it should say what the block is but you need adult muscles to do that and the sides dont hold very many blocks before they all drop. For the price I would not buy this toy, there are so many other cheaper and more interesting ones out there."
5,So Much Fun!,"I bought this for my daughter on her first birthday. She has so much fun. She loves that she can open the door and take the blocks out. I love that she can open the door and put the blocks back. :) She learned that if she puts the block on top, it will tell her what it is and play music. She loves the cat and can now say ""Cat"". She has learned to stack the blocks in the slots and let them fall. She can also stand up and push it wherever she wants it. It's so much fun!!!"
1,Fisher Price missed the mark on this one,"This is the 1st Fisher Price toy that has diappointed us, it is also the most expensive one we have tried.Pros:-Steady enough for baby's just learning to stand.-Nice sort bin with storage for many blocks.Cons:-The stack and spill side does not work consistently, sometimes the blocks spill even without pushing the button.-The mirror on one side is film not plastic so ours was distorted and my child could not see himself in it.-The carosel on top needs a cover as others have mentioned. Also the motor on it is louder that the music.-It is not age appropriate for a 6 month old.-The blocks spilling into the cube is very loud.Overall I think I would have been better off getting the Laugh and learn House."
2,An Incrediwaste of money.,I don't usually buy expensive toys for my kids since they get bored with them after a while but read the great reviews for this one and thought I'd take a chance and do something unlike me for a change. I should have followed my rules. The spin thing was grinding on the first day and the blocks sometimes fall through the slotted side without the lever being pulled. My 3 yr old has more fun with it then my 11 month old as she can pretty much figure out how things work. But even she moves on to something else after a few minutes. My 11 month old finds pulling things out of our recycling bin more entertaining. The plastic that this is made out of also seems faulty. If your child slammed it with a heavy toy it could easily crack. Even if this toy worked as it was supposed to I would still think it is definitely overpriced. I am hoping that with time my 11 month old will play with it more.Now the LeapFrog Fridge Farm Magnetic Animal Set is great and less than half the price.
2,Can't hold the pieces!,"The pieces were just too hard for her to hold. We bought a cheap set that didn't have any special features and she loves that more than this. This would be good for a 2 year old, or maybe even older. Small hands can't handle the pieces."
3,Review - incrediblock,"We purchased this for our 6-month old who can already pull himself up and walk along the couch. When the toy is on the carpet and he pulls up, it slides away from him because it is not heavy enough to stay in one spot. It will be better when he's older, if he's still interested.Also, one side has shoots for the blocks to be stored (and then released) - when the baby went to sit down (from standing with support from the toy), his arm stayed in the shoot and slid down with him. Because we were right there, it wasn't a problem, but it potentially could be.The blocks are great. We purchased the A - Z set and they do have some educational value."
2,Not Worth The Money! Too many problems.,"We got this last night and we are very dissappointed. We really love the peek-a-blocks, but this item was a waste of money. The motor is too loud to hear the music, even on the loudest volume. The blocks fall out of the stackeron their own, or won't fall out when you push the button. The orange door on the sorter will not stay shut. The stickers that are already on, were'nt on well, and the ones you put on, well you'd better get them on right the first time or they will not come off to fix. I hope they come out will a better model for less money because until then, I don't want one. We have EVERY peek-a-block set there is, but this is the only one that needs to go back to the drawing board. We took this back the very next day."
1,"Not worth the $50! Nothing spectacular, its going back to the store","I bought this for my baby after reading what a WONDERFUL toy this is. This thing is too bulky, too cheaply made and too *generic* for $50!!! Save your money and get a few toys that will hold your babys interest, and maybe be little more sturdy then this piece of crap.Too bad there isnt a zero star option, Talk about buyers remorse....."
2,not so incrediblock,"I purchased this for my daughter's first birthday and while it was thew most expensive toy she recieved, it was also the least played with. While it appears to be full of activities, the only side that delivers encouragement was the top of the toy which she liked because she could slow the revolving pictures (which stripped the gears) and she ignored the rest of the toy. My husband and I play with it more than she does. Maybe if she'd recieved it before she could stand the other sides would be more appealing, but as it were, I wish I had my fifty bucks back."
4,Great .... sometimes.,My mother bought this for my son last Christmas when he was 11 months old. He really was not interested in it at all. Now that he is almost two he is starting to play with it alot more. He loves to put the blocks on the top and hear what it is and what sound it makes.
5,"BOUGHT FOR 1 YEAR OLD but, TWO YEAR OLDS LOVE IT!",I purchased the Incrediblock cube for my one year old son and he loves it. I must add that my other two son's age two literally take over this toy and love it as much if not more than my one year old.This toy is awesome and even includes storage area for all of the blocks!This is a great toy!
2,My daughter does not like it,I bought this toy for my one year old daughters birthday. She is now 18 months old and has never taken to it. I have tried to get her to play with it several times but she just doesnt like it. It seems like it would be a fun toy but I guess it depends on the kid. The four sides of play arent really that exciting and when the child puts the block on the top to hear what it says the turntable spins. However the top is where most kids are going to hold onto so the tuntable just gets stuck and makes a horrible noise. I dont think its really worth the money. My advice: find a friend who already has it and see if your child likes it first before you buy it.
4,Still waiting on my dd to really enjoy this.,My dd got this when she was about 12 months old and she still doesnt show to much intrest in it. She plays with it occasionally but thats about it. She's 15 months old now and her intrest in it hasn't really changed much. And this is alot of money to spend on a toy your child never uses. I hope she will enjoy it more in the future. Maybe shes just not as easily entertained as other children or something. But so far she thinks this toy is pretty boring!
1,A Disappointing Christmas Gift,"My 10 month old received this toy for Christmas. I was very excited about it since he has many other peek-a-block toys. When we got the toy out of the box and inserted the batteries the toy does not work. We have tried everything to no avail. So, next I tried to call Fisher Price, Good Luck There! I keep getting hung up on because they say they are having to high a call volume. You can't get any info on their website and my Mother-in-law threw the receipt away from amazon.com. My son does play with it as much as he can. For how much this costs, I expect it to work. I am extremely disappointed in Fisher Price. It looks cute but I wish it worked!"
2,Not worth the price.,"If this was priced around $35 I wouldn't complain, but $77? Ridiculous. It is a plastic box that plays music on top. That's it. Furthermore, I received it in a box that had already been cut open and stickers placed poorly on the block. I may be sending this back."
3,"Fun, but pricey, and only the original 13 blocks make individual sounds.","Fun toy. My kids, 1 & 3, both like it. However, I bought it and the additional alphabet blocks thinking that the toy would tell you what letter you put into it, and it doesn't. Apparently, it only has individual sounds for the original 13 blocks that come with it.That's fine, but the description should be explicit about this, and the price should reflect this.Other than playing a little song and spinning around when you put a block in it, the toy doesn't do much. The sides have little activities, but they aren't that great.Too expensive for what it is by half."
5,Incredible Toy,I thought I would type my first review to rave about this toy. To start with this keeps all of the peek-a-blocks in one place and it stores a ton of them. I love this because I have a 1 year old daughter who has figured out how to work the top part where you put the blocks so it tells you what is in the block. Also it has music. Honestly I can say I am not sick of the noise because you can put it at a level where it is tollerable.All of my neices come over and play with it also and they range from 3-11 so I think I have truely gotten my money's worth.Totally worth it!! This is the most played with toy in the huge mountain of toys we have in our house.Yvette
3,$50!!!!??????,"Waste of $50, they hardly play with it and within a week they had broken it, it no longer spins or responds when a block is placed in and you have to hit the other button just right for music. Maybe at $20 it would be worth it, but not $50"
1,Not worth the money,We were excited about this toy when we bought it. Our daughter does like to stick things in the door. My nephew which is two does like the merry go round on top but my daughter at 15 months isn't that interested in it. It only comes on sometimes when she pushes the button. I am not sure if it has an automatic turn-off or if it doesn't work right. I have to turn it off then on to get it to work again. Nothing else on it gets played with.
4,A decent purchase,"I have a 19 month old and purchased this toy 2 months ago. My son enjoys stacking the blocks and pushing the level so the blocks fall out. He has also added new words to his vocabulary since playing with this toys. I would recommend the toy for pre-toddlers (12-24), who are beginning to pay attention to deals, and can somewhat identify with: what's in the block, what sound does the item in the block make, etc."
3,"not bad, but don't buy at full price","I bought the Incrediblock for my 3rd child's 1st birthday. He had already been walking for a couple of months at that point. Based on how much he plays with it, here is my advice: this is a good toy to purchase for a child who is crawling and starting to pull to a stand. If your child is already walking, it's not worth paying full price. If you can get it at a substantial discount (maybe $35 or less), and don't mind that it is pretty large, I would also recommend it, but otherwise I'd say skip this and get something else."
2,Not happy at all,"I was so excited to get this toy, and when i finally found it I was overjoyed. When I got it home, I noticed the blocks and words were not matching up. The train would say car and vice versa. It turned out to be a big 50.00 piece of junk that took up too much room!It was returned the next day!"
5,"All the ""Bells and Whistles"" a Child Could Want","Fisher-Price is one of the leading toy manufacturers (certainly in England), and you can be confident that this toy is well made and innovative. Children whether young or old are very inquisitive and are always interested in a toy that actually does something. Even if the child is too young to understand what the toy actually does they can still get the fun of seeing things happen when they perform a certain function. The toy has sounds and flashing lights and these are always a plus and guaranteed to make a young child smile. The toy is not cheap, but the quality is there."
4,Great toy for a toddler who doesn't climb on everything,"I bought this for my son for his 1st birthday. He is very active and likes to climb on everything so I wasn't surprised when he wanted to climb on the Incrediblock. But when his knee got stuck in one of the 3 columns that the blocks go in I was upset. It took both my husband and myself to get my son's knee unstuck while he screamed the entire time. I'll see how he does w/ the toy for a few more days and if he doesn't try to climb on it, we'll keep it. But if not, I'm taking it back b/c I'm not gonna risk him getting stuck again. If it weren't for this problem I would love the toy."
4,Mostly Fun,"I purchased the cube for my daughter. She's had it since aobut 6 months and just turned one. She doesn't play with it as often as she use to. However, when we first purchased it she used it to practice standing up. You should brace the cube however. She loved the spinning top and the music. She also loved the sorting bin, and the stacking columns where she could press the lever and make them all fall.My only gripe is the other two sides. The side with the mirror lost my daughter's interest. She really never was interested in it. The side with the falling down pegs seems pretty cool, but it is very difficult to remove the blocks once they're at the bottom. You have to maneuver them to the center then pull out.Other than that she has really enjoyed it and I believe we got our money's worth. Now we're thinking of purchasing the Fisher Price Laugh and Learn Learning Home. It got great reviews and has tons of fun stuff."
3,Not-so-Incredible block,"I bought this toy for my 7 month-old twins, who were starting to pull up and stand. It got great reviews from other twin moms I know, but I was disappointed. Within 5 minutes of introducing it to our explorers, they each pulled it over on top of themselves. As the boys' balance has improved, they tip it less, but it just isn't very stable.I was also disappointed in the activities on each side. The only thing our boys are very interested in is the top, which another reviewer noted has a disappointment of its own...not all peek-a-blocks are compatible with it.Overall, it's OK, but definitely not ""incredible""."
3,a little confusing,"great in theory! Everything works great except that half the time you put a block on the top it will misread it--or putting other blocks on the top will also trigger it to say the ""wrong"" answer. wish they would've fixed this problem before my purchase."
2,save your money and by the house,"The only thing my 17 month old son found entertaining on this thing was the side that you drop the block down and push the red lever to make the blocks fall out. The other side is a mirror, a storage area and a ""plinko"" type thing that is as much fun as watching grass grow. The top side spins and plays music but overall it's not worth the 40$. It's sturdy if baby uses it to help pull himself up but save your money and put it toward the Fisher Price House."
3,It's just OK for the price,"I bought this for my 1- year old son and liked this toy for awhile, but did not play with it constantly. He's now almost 15-months and only pays attention to it only fleetingly each day. I would spend $50 on a variety of interesting, but less expensive toys that I could switch around to keep his interest."
2,Save your money,"We bought this on sale before Christmas for our 9 month old, and although he seemed interested in it at first, it only captured his attention as long as any much cheaper toy. Plus, we noticed the stupid thing likes to say the wrong name when you put blocks on the activation center sometimes. Once it even said ""bird"", when there isn't a bird block. I received ads that seemed to imply it could be used with any Peek a Block, which was why I bought it - to help teach my son to learn objects and sounds, but it only works with these lousy eight blocks. Overall it was a big disappointment, so it is going back to the store and will be replaced with something much more entertaining. The xylophone I bought my son occupies him much more."
2,Overpriced and Disappointing,"My son is 17 months old and everyone was talking about this""great toy"" and it had great reviews, so we decided to get it for Christmas. Big mistake. He lost interest in 10 minutes. It makes a awful grinding sound when my son puts his hand on thetop, the lever side is supposed to hold 12 blocks, after about 6-8, the blocks fall out without pressing the lever. It only comes with 8 blocks and those are the only blocks that work with it. All other blocks just play music and you can't buy additional blocks anywhere. In my opinion, the toy is a big waste of space and money. For $50 you can buy a lot of other toys that are a lot more fun and cheaper. I recommend the little people zoo and the fisher price musical chair my son also got those for christmas and hasn't stopped playing with them!!!"
3,Not much to it,"I thought this to would be great for my 8 mo. old twins who are just starting to pull up to standing. The block is not heavy enough for them to pull up, nor does it stay in place while they are standing. Okay - I didn't know for sure that it would be great for these things but for the money it really isn't that much fun. There should be more lights and music when they do things. For example there are knobs and flaps to turn, but nothing happens when you turn them - there is no cause and effect. I am keeping this because I'm hoping as they get older it may be more fun for them, but for now it's a pretty boring toy."
2,peek-a-blocks incrediblock,My 11month old never got interested in it! We would sit in the floor & play w/ it! I would show her the different things it did!She would loose interest quicly! I think one of the mogor things wrong w/ it is the music is not loud enough to keep there attention! We have it turned all the way up & it still is pretty soft. Her other toys are pretty loud & they keep her playing! The box only has one speaker & it is on the side. So maybe if they put more than one speaker it would be better.
2,"Broken quickly, returned quickly","We waited a long time for this toy, but like many others, parts of our block broke quickly (the side with the lever). We returned it for the defects, and because our children were only interested in stopping the top from turning-- the other sides were not interesting. Not worth the money...."
2,Thought it would be much better,I bought this toy for my daughter when she was 9 months old. It was a Christmas present and I thought we should try it out. There really wasn't much on this toy to play with. It has four sides. One side that opens to store blocks. One side to drop the blocks in and watch them bounce down (very loudly.) One side to put them in and push and button to watch them fall out (again very loudly.) And one more side with two holes to put the blocks in (very boring.) The top I thought had potential but the motor on top was so loud it scared my daughter and drowned out the music. If you can't tell I was pretty disappointed with this toy. We ended up taking it back. My daughter loves her Peek a Blocks but this toy was not fun enough for us.
3,Wal-Mart has this for $39,"I don't have this, but it's currently listed for $79 here and I just found it at Wal-Mart (not available on-line) for $39 bucks. Definitely worth the trip to the store. The Wal-Mart site does, though, have a great video of how it all works."
4,This a great toy!,"When I bought this for my daughter at 11 months, she didn't play with it that much. She did like it, but she enjoyed her other toys more. But, she definitely played with it more as she got older. And now, at 18 months, she plays with it a lot. She likes to put the blocks inside the Incrediblock and also enjoys watching them fall down the side. The one downfall of this toy is that it's expensive! I'm not sure, after having it for 8 months, if it's totally worth the price. But it is a fun toy!"
3,great to help them learn to stand,big and pricy. the only thing my children like about this toy is the button on top that plays music. i have triedto show them if you put one the blocks in the square ontop it would make the noise of whateve s in the block. absolutly no intrest. the throw the blocks at one another and the broke the side door off. all i know is thebabies on these to commericals must be gifted or something.
5,For My Fiance,"I got this for my Fiance's ""Boy Room"" where he keeps all of his sports stuff. I loved the antique look of this pennant. Its a birthday gift for him and I'm sure he'll love it too!"
3,Rubber's too tight,Nice swivel type but make sure you have a locking extension to get them out of the hole when your putting spark plugs in or you'll have to take it out and use something else. Hopefully they will wear a little over time.
5,A great book for spouses to read together,"Unfortunately the use of pronography by both men and women is exploding and draining marriages of the emotional and psychological energy needed for marital bonding. In this book, I Surrender All, both Clay Crosse and his wife describe the devestating effects internet pornography had on their marriage and their slow and painful journey to marital wholeness. A great book for couples to read together. It allows husbands and wives to sometimes reveal their own feelings, through reading Clay and Renee's accounts, that they might never have the courage to say to one another otherwise. This is a wonderful book for all couples, and especially for Christian couples, to use in working this this growing problem."
4,very sincere and humble,"i d like to thank the crosse family not only for sharing about the sin that is often taking too lightely, but mainly they shared about the difference of the shallow and lukewarm christian life and their deep conversion. i live in the czech republic and there is a very low percentage of christians down here. we need testimonies like clay s and renee s to avoid same mistakes and compromises. i recommend the book. it s easy to read and captivating."
5,Buy it for your husband,"This is a really good book for those husbands who struggle with Pornography, and also for the wives to read...it gives you a Godly perspective of the realities and consequences of the destructive nature of pornography. There are too many cases where marriages are destroyed because of the evil nature of pornography, and the fact that it is so accessible on the internet...this is one of those books that gives a true account of their lives from both the perspective of the husband and the wife. Buy it, you will find it is a very good jumpstart to accountability for your husbands struggle. This is a good companion to use but please be aware that counseling is most important in helping your husband ""beat the porn"" rap...."
1,I'm very disappointed in this book,I'm very disappointed in this book. I really wanted to like this book but this is an extremely religious book and I just couldn't finish it. I tried and tried to read this book but the author does a great job of shutting people out. If you are not a Christian...then there is no help for you. Best of luck to the author on his recovery but avoid this book...
2,How to build tri-five chevy trucks,This book has lots of good information and step by step instruction and picture on suspension and running gear up -grades for 55-57 chevy trucks. The book explaines several different front suspension upgrades and goes through step by step instalations of several of the options. This book is good for the begining and expert machanic and i would recomend it to anybody interested in this vintage of chevy trucks. strayerking@hotmail.com
4,Does its job!,"Purchased these to help with a battery corrosion problem (I guess thats always the point of buying these). Was pleased at how they've worked thus far. I will say they are a bit expensive as I totally spaced out about a local hardware store which had them for half the price. But seeings how this is a review on the product and not the price, I'll give it a 4 star. Nice product and decent packaging/display."
1,Not Ready for Prime Time,"I purchased several of these bulbs for outside my home and am now on my 3rd round of replacements. They just do not seem to last more than 3 to 4 months. Save your money and wait for the designs to improve. For how long they last, I would just as soon buy incandescent which generates more light overall."
3,Not the Brightest Bulb,LED's have really come along way but this bulb is not really bright enough to be used in a Par 30 ceiling fixture to provide task lighting. It would be good in a room that you might typically use a dimmer to reduce your current lighting. Of course the power savings is tremendous; even compared to compact fluorescent bulbs.
2,below average LED bulb,There are better bulbs that output brighter and warmer light for the same price or less.I would not recommend this light for indoor use due to it's cold (blue) color temperature ( 5500K ? ) nor would I recommend this light for outdoor use due to it's narrow beam and brightness (or lack thereof).I give it two stars instead of one only because it is not truly dysfunctional
2,Not quite what I expected,I don't think the technology is there yet for using LED's in a floodlight format
3,Good But Dated,"This book is a well written survey of high grade, expensive sailboats. The information is getting very dated. We need a new edition if the reader wants current advice on selection of a sailboat. Few of the boats covered are current production boats, though I assume all of them could be built for an owner in a custom yard. I found the general principles described in the book helpful, but the newer materials and newer designs that have come out in the years since this book was published make the book dated. I would have rated this book five stars when it came out, but its value to me as a first time sailboat buyer today makes me give the book only three stars."
1,Misleading Publishing Information,"This book was not first published in 2001, as suggested by Amazon's information, so what is offered is either a second edition or there is a typo in the date of publication. Some of the manufacturers are no longer in existance (as pointed out by another reviewer), and Vol. II of this book was published in 2003 with updated reviews of most of the boat builders covered in Vol I.Yes, it is a stunning picture book, no, it is not of the slightest use for any other purpose, and even as a picture book it does not equal or compare well with Vol. II."
3,Could use more details,"The book had wonderful photographs and nice tidbits about the boats, but many of the detailed photographs weren't even explained via captions."
1,Wrong Item,"When I went on-line to order the book that I wanted I specifically asked for Vol II. I received instead Vol. 1. Because this was a birthday gift for my husband I tried again for the Vol II book and PAID for shipping so that I would get the book in 2 days.I still do not have my refund credited for the above book, although I received an email saying that I was credited."
4,Try if you dare,The anticipation for the next shock is most of the fun. Trying to handle the jolt is also exciting.
2,No info,This item was not fully explained and can not be used around mu grandchild who has a pacemaker. also the recommended age was not stated
2,Cumbersome interface needs streamlining,"I've been using Paint Shop Pro for several years, but wanted to try Photo Express 4.0 for its red eye removal and printing capabilities.I take mainly snapshots, and so need to remove a lot of red eye! While Photo Express's red eye removal tool is neat and works fine, it is quite clumsy going back to thumbnail view after editing a photo! You have to click the ""mode"" button then click ""Browse"", each time! If it used a standard MDI interface, like Paint Shop Pro does, the browse window would just be there when you closed the photo window.Another gripe: the thumbnails are not stored on disk after they're created (like Paint Shop Pro does). Consequently, it has to recreate them each time you visit the directory, which can take awhile.These two problems are bad enough that I'm going to return the program."
2,I am very disappointed with 4.0,I have used Ulead Photo Express for a couple years now and love it. I down loaded a trial version of 4.0 and found that Ulead has removed the Dust/scratch removal from the program. When editing photos this is a must. So 4.0 is off my shopping list. I will find another program that compares or continue to use 3.0 Platinum. Ulead customer service acted offended that I even asked about the scratch/dust removal in 4.0. I guess they don't want further business from me.
3,the politics of submarines,"This was a good journalistic (that is gossipy, not analytic) history of the politics surrounding submarines: the obtuseness of naval departments and international politics that surrounded and usually hindered the development of subs. But if you pick up this book really wanting to learn about the subs themselves, you will be quite disappointed. A few minutes with Hutchinson's ""War Beneath the Waves"" will tell you more about them than hours with this general history."
2,Get another type,"We just bought this after seeing a similar one at a friend's house. This toy is very flimsy. The pen needs a longer point as little ones just learning to hold a pen generally don't hold it straight up. You have to swipe several times to erase. Our daughter is entertained by it, but I have seen better. It's also only $14.97 at Target Stores."
3,Pen problems,"I was very excited to discover the Little People Doodle Pro when my son was turning 2, because the shorter nib on the pen seemed more suitable for his age. However, as other reviewers have indicated, the point is actually TOO short to use in anything other than a straight vertical position, which is not how my son holds a pen. Also, the cord connecting the pen to the drawing board is too short for the pen to reach all areas of the drawing board. The eraser is a little hard to move as well."
4,Great for car,I bought this to keep in my car during those long car rides. My daughter loves to use it.
3,Prefer the Original Magnadoodle,"I first bought the Little People Magnadoodle for my 12-month-old son. He had a very difficult time using the pen because the tip is so short he had to hold it straight up and down to make a mark. The shapes worked great, though, and I liked that they were held in the case by strong magnets. My son also could not push the ball across to erase the screen very well because it was so stiff. The screen eventually pierced, causing it to leak fluid. So I bought the original magnadoodle, and I've been much happier. The pen is easy to use, doesn't get caught on the balloons, and he can easily erase the board. The shapes don't have as strong of a magnetic effect on the board, and the storge drawer is a bit stiff, but he now loves his new Magnadoodle. This one's a keeper."
4,A toy that doesn't give parents a headache,"Because the pen comes attached to the doodle, you don't have to worry about losing it. You can lose the magnets and then find them again as I found one this morning. We got this for my son before he was 2 and he continues to enjoy it now that he is 2 1/2. This is one of a handful of toys he plays with again and again.I've seen bad pens where the tip was shoved in. So far, we have not had this problem. This is not an issue with every doodle and if it is a problem, I'd exchange it rather than just take it back because it does work well when you get a good one. My son draws at all angles (he's two) and it writes well. He's able to erase the drawing without help (it might be harder for those who aren't two-years-old yet, but they catch on quickly).We've had toys where a pen or item was attached and it was too short -- Doodle Pro doesn't have this problem."
1,pen doesn't work,I was very disappointed with this product. My 2 1/2 yr. old twins got this toy for Christmas & were very frustrated with it because the pen doesn't work if you hold it at an angle. You must hold the pen straight for it to work. My 5 yr. old didn't like it either. I ended up returning the toy for a different magna doodle with a better pen.
2,Sad to see - not easy for a toddler to use,"I had previously purchased the standard blue Doodle Pro for my 3 year old, and he loved it - a great toy. So when my 1 1/2 year old twins started showing an interest in drawing, I purchased one of these Little People boards for each of them. Much to my disappointment, the tip on the end of the pen was so short that its impossible to draw unless the pen is straight up and down. The soccer ball slide eraser is so tight that they can hardly move it. The only good thing is the magnets are nice and big and easy to use. I have to say that all in all, this is taking the product downhill - stick with the standard Doodle Pro, you'll be much happier."
1,pen doesn't work,"The concept is adorable for those young little people fans. I love the shape stampers & they come out very easily for little fingers. My 20 month old daughter can erase the picture herself with the soccer ball eraser. The problem for myself, my 20-month-old & my 6 year-old who also tested this toy is that the pen is made in a way that if you turn the pen at an angle to draw or write (the normal way anyone would hold a pen or pencil) it won't write. It has a short magnetic tip on the end combined with blunt plastic around it instead of the angled pen of the magna doodle. I returned the first one & purchased a second one thinking maybe the first was simply defective & they are both the same. I also compared it with other models & it is just made weird. Bottom line..stampers are great but rather frustrating to draw with."
4,Great toy for my toddler!!!,"My daughter received this for Christmas, and she was 19 months old. She LOVES it!!! She will play with it for hours. I didn't have the problems the other people have with the pen. She can use it just fine. My husband and I can both write with it just fine. My daughter loves to make the shapes move. If you can get the shapes in the right spot on the board, the magnetic remover will actually make the shapes move across the board while you erase it. I have purchased this for a few children after getting it for my daughter."
2,you have to be a fan of Japanese anime,"Both films are lame. They're supposed to be. This DVD has two films that are meant to take Japanese anime into real world / real people level, and in the process still keep the feel of Japanese anime intact. If you understand that, you will enjoy the DVD. If you don't like Japanese anime, you should avoid paying full price and get it used. I'm not sure about Makiriko, but Battler Sienne Matra is worth watching - even if it does look like it was made in somebody's garage and back yard. Very low budget, Z-movie films, few people involved, and heads up, the language is in Japanese with English subtitles. The first film would likely be rated PG, the second film would be rated R. There is violence, partial nudity, and unless you speak Japanese the subtitles don't have any vulgar language. Not meant for viewing by the non-Japanese anime initiated, and nearly anybody else will wish they skipped this."
1,Does not measure up to claim,"This headset fits well, but it works poorly.If you cue send recieve directly through the walky-talky, it works, but its not worth the trouble. The hands-free feature is pathetically useless.Works sometimes, and when it does, there is 10 second delay to get it going. If you don't mind repeating everthing you say twice and never pausing, I guess you could communicate with it -- if it was life and death -- but otherwise, a total waste of effort and money. The instructions are a joke. I do not recommend buying this at all."
4,Motorola 56320 2-Way Radio Earpiece with Boom Microphone,"They were as dipicted but were difficult to keep on my ear. As an event planner, I sometime need more than two units."
1,No bueno!!,It was not working with the very same product it said it was compatible with. My little boy was very disappointed at Christmas that he couldn't use it.
2,not compatible with what you may think,This product seems like a great idea but only if it works with the radio that you have. When I recieved this product I plugged it into my t5400 and expected to be able to speak and listen without any buttons. Well I couldn't do this because the t5400 is not compatible even though this site and the packaging say that it is. I am returning the product to amazon expecting a full refund including shipping. I am very disappointed with the situation I have encountered and wait on the outcome which will depend on myself shopping on amazon again.
1,Dont buy,"it lookd very sexy and it caught my eye. Mototrola must be good, Right? Wrong!! the earpiece simply does not work. Dont buy"
4,They work,"These mics work just fine in quiet places. I wanted these for my husband and I to communicate when we're riding our ATV's. Unfortunately the ATV's were too loud, and the mics wanted to stay on constantly. But the point is they work. I would recommend them."
2,Not for large ears,I never even got to testing the audio quality because the ear piece was so uncomfortable. My ears are on the large side - but not huge - and this didn't fit well at all. I haven't had problems with other around-the-ear headsets but this one is rigid with a tight fit. Putting it on is a two handed operation requiring folding and tucking of ear parts. If I try to take it off with one hand it pinches my ear painfully. I'll be returning it.
3,2-way Radio Earpiece,This earpiece works fine with the Motorola radio we have if you do not use the VOX feature. When using VOX one radio or the other remains keyed so 2-way communication is not possible.
2,Motorola 56320 2-Way Radio Earpiece with Boom Microphone,"The earpiece is OK as just that, an earpiece. The Boom mike with my Motorola MR350 is not sensitive enough. Even with the radio at highest sensitivity setting the mike takes a while to turn on when 1st trying to transmit and it turns off in the middle of transmission."
1,Not The Best,"After trying unsuccessfully to get the ear piece to stay on my ear, I gave up and returned the unit to Amazon."
2,Motorola Earpiece with Boom Mic,I brought this product several days now an is unable to use it as the ports for the radio is different that what came on the item... I searched for an M1 plug before purchasing and it came up with this item... The display photo did not display the jack either... I was gonna return the item but ordered an adapter instead...Motorola Earpiece with Boom Microphone
2,unusable,The product is not usable as it has the wrong size plug. I needed 1/8th and it came with a 3/32nd. The ad discription was incomplete as it failed to indicate what size plug it came with
3,Not worth purchasing if you're not going to use voice-activated mode,"I purchased these with the hope I could use them on an upcoming ski trip. Our walkies are not VOX (voice activated) compatible (VOX radios are too big to fit in your pocket comfortably), and I was hoping these headsets would have a button on the wire (etc) that you could press to activate PTT (Push To Talk) mode. They do not.Instead, if you want to use PTT to talk, you need to take the radio out of your pocket, press the button, talk into headset release button. It's really no better than holding the walkie up to your head. Sigh.(And I'm sure these work great with VOX radios, I just didn't want to use VOX since I've heard negative things about delays, hearing people's breathing, etc.)"
1,Will not stay on my ear,"I cannot get this to stay on my ear. When I do get it on, it is not close enough to my ear, so it's hard to hear. I now use the earbud model with a PTT/mic on the cord -- Motorola 53727."
1,Cheap!,Had a Calphalon jelly roll pan I was replacing (my dau in law liked it!) and this was a big disappointment. Not worth the money to ship it!
2,"Too brief a bibliography, too historical a trading or inv bk","I understoodd that it would be stupid to expect something close to the ""Market Wizard"" standard from a 342 page book covering over 80 big names intriguing enough for 180 more books. However, I did expect a summary or two about the life, trading or investment methods of the people covered in the book. The passage devoted to Bernard Baruch is a rare exception to the above. A pity that it was mostly copy and paste from the work of other authors. Even worse, the content is not timely. For e.g., the article of Robertson was written nearly a decade before the Tiger Fund got drown in Russia. It would be much better if the author had written several volumes and covered more and timely of each guru."
4,Insightful!,"Writing with James R. Vertin, author Charles D. Ellis presents brief profiles of 85 Wall Street leaders who contributed to the growth of the world's major financial marketplace. The authors divide these individuals - all men, which tells a tale right there - into four slightly arbitrary groups: masters of investing, movers and shakers, business builders, and wisemen and rascals. The collection is drawn from the other writers' pieces about these men, and includes occasional articles the featured financiers wrote themselves. Apart from a few brief notes about some patterns that the author observed, these excerpts from various sources stand alone, with no overarching theme or exposition. We [...] keenly feel the lack of a few analytical essays that might have pulled the collection together and integrated it thematically, but even so, this serves as a useful research tool and an interesting introduction to a unique confluence of powerful men."
1,Can get better reviews for free from their website,"You can get better reviews from actual parents than what they offer in their book. I purchased a crib based on their recommendations, and it's a big piece of junk. I wished that I had found the reviews on their website first so I could've gotten a good piece of furniture."
5,Ah! Parenthood!,"I bought ""Baby Bargains"" because out of all of the books I bought while I was getting married, ""Bridal Bargains"" (same authors, obviously) was the only TRULY helpful book.These books are loaded with information, but somehow are not overwhelming to read. They provide websites, addresses, and phone numbers if possible. Clear, and concise, this book is THE ONE BOOK you need. In fact, this time around I knew that I would not have to bother odering any other ""consumer-advice type"" of book for my baby shopping once I ordered ""Baby Bargains"". Wish I had known that when I was buying all those ""consumer-advice styled"" books when I was planning my wedding.Can't say that I didn't learn from my mistake. =)"
5,Very helpful resource for first time parents,"This book really helped me figure out what type of stroller I needed and helped me make some decisions on a variety of other items including our car seat, crib and high chair. I thought it was a great resource, but I did do other research on some of the items just to help make up my mind. I would recommend this book to someone who is having their first child and is overwhelmed by all of the baby products and brands out there."
1,Message to the author,"To Mel: AKA (Denise Fields) Do you really think people don't know you are writing your own reviews on your book? Everytime there is a bad review, suddenely a marvelous 5 star shows up the next day. Get off your high horse and drop your ego.. Not everyone likes your book. You are not Martha or Madonna!About the book: There is a rule of thumb about this book. If you buy it, use common sense. Not all reviews are for you."
1,Beware: Amazon offers you sellers who have several editions when you search the latest edition,"The book is supposed to be good, but while searching for the newest edition at amazon.com, i was directed to a seller who had a very old edition and that was not specified during the sale process!!!"
1,It's all about my choice,"Written from an unborn baby: If you think you will save money you WON'T and here is why. The reviews in this book are horrible. These people write about things they have no use for themselves (the authors do not have young children) and many of the products they have featured in past editions of their books have been recalled and clearanced. I am hoping that my mom would take the time to review products and not rely on a book from some authors who write reviews and then charge you for them If you are lazy, get this book. If you care about saving money, don't. Mom, you are entitled to a choice."
5,Very helpful book!,"This book is very helpful, especially when you are a first time parent and have no idea about the plethora of baby products that are out there. I definitely recommend this book to the first time parent!"
1,Not worth the money,"Even if you believe that their reviews are spot-on, there is nothing in this book that cannot be found for free on the Internet. By the time the book is published it is outdated and it is limited in the options presented in each category. Save yourself the money and put it toward something USEFUL for your child. Hop on the web to one of a number of parenting sites easily found through a Google search. These folks are not experts in the parenting field, have not personally used most of the products they are reviewing, and rely on real life parent reviews from others - for example, the message boards they host on their website, so why not go straight to the source - parents in the trenches who are using these products right now?"
1,Don't waste your money!,The book is filled with typos and outdated advice. You can get much better information on the internet for FREE. The book will not save you money at all--it will only make the authors more.
2,Some useful tips but...,"Yes, you can find some useful advice here, but it's like looking for a needle in a haystack. This book is extremely verbose, and the information is consequently rather poorly organized. If you're looking for a crib, for instance, what you need is clear listing of the selection criteria, and how each manufacturer/model measures up. This takes a couple of pages in a tabular format. Instead, the information is spread over 70-80 pages of verbiage, and it's up to you to dig out what' you're looking for.Another thing I noticed is that the authors keep referring to the Consumers Reports recommendations, especially when it comes to safety issues. It turns out there is a consumer reports book for baby products. I thought it dishonest to copy someone else's work in this manner."
5,gives a great overview of the millions of baby products,"I found this book very useful. A few of the suggestions are still a bit over the top (emphasis on name brands) and you have to use common sense. But overall, there are many, great tips to narrow down for each category, the millions of products available for your child and still pick a quality product."
4,"Excellent guide, but...","I loved this 2003 book, and I used it for all my major purchases while preparing for the arrival of my first baby. I took the advice given about ordering the nursery furniture at least 6 months ahead of time and ordered forevermine, which the book gave excellent reviews. The furniture didn't arrive until almost 8 months after I ordered it, and the quality is not nearly what I expected. I was very disappointed with receiving it after my baby was born- I would have cancelled the order if they were honest about the delivery date; and I was surprised the guide recommended such a poorly made product."
2,"Too much information, not precise or well researched","Found this book to be overwhelming with too many choices and ideas. Not ideal for the parent/grandparent who is clueless on what to get. I didn't find the descriptions very helpful and MANY products are unavailable and no longer made. That is frustrating. Best to do internet searches for free. Also, I disagree with many of their comments. I read in another review that the authors don't even have young children.. How can they write about products they don't use?"
5,What consumer reports is for everything else...,"This book was a tremendous asset for us. We rec'd an older version from a friend and decided to get the newest version since it seemed so helpful. We are adopting and our son will be at the ""change over"" point for a lot of developmental things. There were things we thought we needed - and found out we didn't. Plus with all the changes in the world all that ""free"" advice we were getting was outdated, even when it came from fairly new parents!Loved the book - GET IT."
5,"If You're A New Parent, You NEED This Book","As a new parent, I was overwhelmed by all of the ""stuff"" that comes with a baby. This book helped me sift through all of the various makes, models, and manufacturors so I could purchase what I needed without wasting any money. If you make any major purchases without reading this book first, you will regret it later."
1,Impractical ADVICE,This book is filled with impractible advice and poorly written reviews.Terrible book and waste of money.I bought it and sold it.
1,This book insults me,"[...] I'm a new mom...I'm not an expert.. neither are the people who wrote this book. Because they all read the same, [...] I am a single mother of twins and I think the advice in this book stinks.It is nothing but lists of crappy products based on nothing. Most of the information you can find for free on the internet. [...] I bought 2 products based on the advice from this married couple (without babies) -one of those take along infant chairs and a potty chair. Both fell apart. Enough said."
1,The authors think they are G-D,"....it' all about buying your baby needs at Wal Mart, isn't it? Why didn't they just publish this book. You don't save money because these horribly-written reviews lead you to believe you ""NEED"" all of this plastic crap to be a good parent. You don't.Swaddle your baby (oops. the authors poo-poo products that do this) breastfeed your baby (oops. the authors poo-poo products that do this) and diaper your baby with organic cloth (oops. the authors poo-poo products that do this) and you will be a horrible mama.Sat nam."
1,WHAT I HATE ABOUT THIS BOOK,"What I hate about this book is that the authors lead you to believe that their reviews will allow you to make your OWN choices on what is IDEAL for YOU. They do not offer any expertise in this field or information in this book. Consumer Reports are the experts on this and have a testing agency to back their claim. This is nothing more than an opinion of some journalists who DO NOT HAVE KIDS. To me, this is a consumer scam."
4,Baby Bargins Very Helpful,"We found this book to be very helpful when registering for our bigger items such as the high chair, travel system and pack n' play. Also many other good tips through out. I would recommend this book to any expecting parent."
5,A must-read for all parents,"We bought the earlier edition of this book and found it to be one of the staples of our baby preparation process. Granted their recommendations don't work for everybody, we appreciated the guidance they gave. They brought to light many things we would not have even thought about."
1,Buy Consumer Reports Best Baby Products instead,"I found the Consumer Reports book to be more informative in terms of which products to buy, how to know which brand/model is right for you, features to look for and the safety and money saving info is outstanding. Baby Bargains covers lots of ground, but doesn't go into detail about any one product. It's also confusing because the product info is scattered throughout the book rather than in one spot. I liked the Consumer Reports book much better."
1,This book is stupid,"Who needs a book like this? Really, what is special about this book. manufacturers laugh about the credibility of these people and only support it for free press. Parents seem to like it and hate it. I seem to think the whole thing is stupid.I would not buy this book for a penny. Buy Consumer Reports or Kim Danger's 1000 Baby Bargains instead."
3,Helpful in the beginning,"I do appreciate the advice and resources provided by the experienced parents/authors. It is very well written and has a friendly tone.With the popularity of online reviews where opinions are shared among consumers and you get the collective wisdom of many-for free, this book is just one resource I turn to for product reviews. I used this book to narrow down my baby product choices but I still rely on online reviews and trying out the products in-store to make the final decision."
3,Reviews read like advertising,"I'm laughing out loud because some of the bad reviews are so true. The good reviews read like commercials! Who made these authors experts? The reviews are not written very well and I find other parents' opinions much more helpful to me. I have 3 young children and 1 grandchild who lives with us. This book has not been too helpful for our household but I'm guessing parents who want a quick read about things may enjoy it. I have to say I would suggest perusing it at the bookstore first. I have to agree that the internet is a better source. Babycenter.com has helped me. That website is free and has much better reviews than this book. Also, I did buy one outfit from a manufacturer they listed as good and the whole thing shrunk after 1 washing (yes, I followed the directions). That made me pretty angry since I bought it on based on their advice."
4,Very helpful,"This book really helped me weed through all the baby products that are out there. It brought things into perspective with details about convenience that might not have been noticed in the store, but would have become very obvious with use over time. I ended up with all baby products I loved, including my stroller, playyard, high chair, boppy, carseats, etc. It's a good investment when you consider how much you're going to spend on all your gear."
4,Good,"Too much information given on some items, contradictory at times therefore confusing the person even more. Book came to me in just 2 days even with regular shipping which was awesome. Definitely a good book to have on hand incase you are not sure. I loved the rating system of grades."
3,Can be compared to a marxist novel...,"This book is a good resouce for first time parents...HOWEVER, the authors sometimes preach which baby items are good based on reasons that may or may not be applicable to you. When you read through the book, take the comments with a ""grain of salt"". Go to the store and look at the products, rather than taking their advice on everything. Additionally, I found that they would oftentimes negatively rank a product because of a high price. This was frustrating because they would remain focused on the high item cost, rather than the benefits of the item."
1,Baby Bargains for the birds,"I wrote a review but I just have one more thing to say. As a mother of 6 (yes, you read that right) I have not saved any money because of this book. The products listed are old, the reviews are biased and the authors think they are GOD. They write in their book that they are the ""Bible"" for parents. They also ask you not to share the book so they can make more money. Keep that in mind. My 6 kids have what they need and I sure would not give any of my money to these loons."
2,Not a bargain. That's for sure.,"I find this book to be nothing more than a glorified magazine, and those are half the price. I do not think these authors are credible, they are journalists, for heaven's sake, not experts. What the h_ll do they know about baby bottles that's better than the advice of a new mother or any parenting magazine you get free at the hospital or OB/GYN office. Most of the reviews are outdated. This book is all about hype and self-promotion. Not worth the paper it is printed on. Don't be fooled. You ""rarely"" see this duo in the media with their advice on credible parenting shows. Look elsewhere for advice.. ask your mother-in law instead."
1,Accessorize your baby- don't think about safety,"If you buy this book, you might as well list recalls.gov in your favorites list.So many of these ""faved"" reviews seem to turn up as recalls. I have the first book and got this one by mistake ( I thought I was buying another book- my bad) and these authors are not on the money on safety for kids. They are on the money for what's expensive and looks good as an acessory to your baby. Most reviews in this book is for the clueless parent who does not give a s___t on what they really need.. they just want crap to add to their baby shower list so their friends and family can pay for it.. (Hence the expensive not needed and not functional strollers) Skip the book and check websites instead for FREE. Also, there is no credibility behind the reviews.. it's just the opinions of these people trying to make a buck off you."
1,authors are not experts,The ratings on all products in this book are based on opinions. It is cheaper to ask your friends who have kids than buy this book. Most of the products they list are NOT needed. I wasted tons of money with my first child thanks to this scam. I know better (on my third now) that this book is only good for the return policy. My nanny is the one who tipped me off on what a scam this book is and I hope more parents realize this.
2,wheels are made of hollow plastic do not spin freely,"I bought this item for my[...] who insisted on having 4 wheels. Body of scooter is a good design with a wide place to stand but wheels are very cheap, made out of plastic that they use on power wheels. Would not but if i had seen in person."
2,disappointed,"I was excited originally to have found this frame however when I got it the pegs didn't quite fit and there is no ""glass"" for the frame so the puzzle flops around and no backing so the glued puzzle needs to be well formed in order to stay together."
5,"Dark, Ethereal, Wonderful","The Delerium influence here is unmistakable. I have been a fan of FLA for about 10 years, and this is certainly a departure. It sounds little like their earlier albums. Is that a bad thing? Hell no! It is so dark and melodic throughout, and heavy at parts. As great as Maniacal is, Transmitter (Come Together) is even better: a ballroom dance waltz for the dead and insane. This album is every bit as good as Millenium, only in very different ways, and among the best of the past year by any band. Any fan of dark/industrial music would be proud to own Civilization."
3,nice ALBUM,"Its great to hear rhys back to FLA !!!!I think millenium was their peak - before they started to soundlike all the other generic ""indutrial"" dance crap out theremaybe not as groundbreaking as they used to be but still quite goodThese guys are the real thing- they dont take the ""industrial"" tag literally - they play what they feel -this is way more important than owing alligence to some genre"
2,Someone Kidnapped FLA,"I've been a longtime FLA fan since the ""Neural Implant"" days. I don't know who the guys are on this CD but they sure don't sound like my FLA. This CD sucks. It's slow, boring, and fragmented.The guys on this CD sound like either new comers or a band that has totally lost it's identity. Goodbye FLA!!!!"
5,Simply Marvelous!,"I just got finished listening to this CD for the first time today and I must say overall I'm very, very impressed. Bill Leeb & Rhys Fulber are back with a vengence creating a wonderful & mature industrial album. Its exactly the kind of album I was wishing they would make(mostly slow & moody). If your a fan of dark electronic music you should be on your way to purchasing this right now without hesitation. This cd wont be leaving my player anytime soon."
3,Delerium Assembly,"After listening to this one a few times I've come to the inescapable conclusion that Bill and Rhys need to keep their projects separate. There are far too many hints of Delerium and Conjure One in this music, and while I actually do like those side projects, they have no place in FLA's repertoire. The droning female chants on top of heavy industrial? No thanks.I this one a 3 out of 5, because while there are some catchy tracks on the album, it's just not what I was expecting from the single Maniacal."
4,"No title, but great motiv !","Though I am a stomathologyst, I've been interesed in it and I think the book is cool. But four stars. That's right and it is just because of it's 628 pages which I (personally)think is way too much and the work loses it's major concept. But I MUST congratulate the author, Mr.Topol, for it's exelent fabula, and as I said before, thank You for making the publc avaliable of reading Your works."
