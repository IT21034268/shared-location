4,Graphic and compelling account of German Navy WWII,"Wonderfully and skillfully written account of a German sailor in WWII that also weaves parallels with Greek mythology to American classics. Sometimes lighhearted, sometimes bewildering imagery, but always an adventure that takes the hero to hell and back - several times. When one wonders if Teidemann ever makes it back, one realizes that the entire book is written in the first person and this somehow adds to the value of the story. A wonderful examination of the very worst in human nature and nature itself. You will never see seagulls quite the same after this."
5,"a fascinating journey into ""what if""","What if one could ""host"" the memories of a famous person, of someone who has qualities that you wish you had, of your deceased beloved. How would you be changed? How would the long-deceased react to the modern world? These are some of the questions that the stellar authors in this anthology attempt to explore.A scientist discovers how to extract memories from genetic material. He becomes Dr. Chimera - a blend of himself and his beloved wife. An inventor hosts Leonardo da Vinci and finds there is more to life than inventing. A mother gets more than she bargained for when she melds an explorer with her comatose daughter.A variety of authors from the science fiction, fantasy and mystery genres tackle this premise of experiencing the memories of another and a very satisfying anthology is born."
4,Not Exactly,"I received my first shipment of the Superwinch 2202380 mount kit. Mounting bracket appeared to be specific to my 2002 Arctic Cat but found NO roller fairlead in the package. Product description was ""roller fairlead included"". I thought the shipment was incomplete, returned it to Amazon.com and received a second shipment. Again did not include the roller fairlead. This mount kit from Superwinch DOES NOT INCLUDE THE ROLLER FAIRLEAD. Amazon.com made it right with me. Very satisfied with Amazon.com. The mounting bracket was an exact fit for my 2002 Arctic Cat and installed easily."
2,"interesting, but I wish it delved deeper","This book gave lots and lots of arguments that were very nice and well thoughtout, but it often seemed that the point-counterpoint ""arguing"" was a little redundant. The whole book consisted of an article or an event that had to do with the ethics of euthanasia and two people with conflicting views would write why. I wish that the book had some documented dialog between the two opinions. It was a little boring reading the same opinions over and over again. ""euthanasia as long as it is consentual and necessary should be permitted yada yada yada"" ""killing another innocent being should not be permitted at all because it is murder yada yada yada"" Each and every writer was very elegant and well spoken, but I simply wish there was more dialog between the two people, not simply between book editors."
3,BIG NAMES ADDRESS THE RIGHT-TO-DIE,"Jonathan D. Moreno, PhD, editorArguing Euthanasia:The Controversy over Mercy Killing, Assisted Suicide,and the ""Right to Die""(New York: Simon & Schuster, 1995) 251 pagesA collection of 19 articles by well-known authors such as Timothy Quill,Nat Hentoff, Betty Rollin, Ronald Dworkin, Sidney Hook, Daniel Callahan,H. Tristram Engelhardt, Jr., Margaret Pabst Battin, Dan Brock, & Leon Kass.Both sides of the debate are well represented.And this format--presenting complete articles--gives more space to each thinker than other 'both-sides' collections,which usually give each author only 2 or 3 pages.This book could be a good introduction to the issues,but it does not break any new ground.If you would like to read other books on these themes,search the Internet for the following precise expression:""Books on the Right-to-Die""James Leonard Park, advocate of the right-to-die with careful safeguards."
4,Cinco razones para comprar el CD,a) Exterminador tiene los corridos más perrones b) Están actualizados c) Exterminador es pa' compas pesados d) Tienen una excelente caja de ritmos e) Ridiculizan la border patrol americana y la federal mexicana.
5,Concise and well written,"This book explores the question of how English came to be the premier international language of our time. Crystal begins with various ways of defining ""international language"", and he explains how English alone among other widely spoken languages meets all criteria. The book includes numerous maps and descriptions documenting the spread of English throughout former British colonies. It is concise and well written."
5,Fantastically entertaining,"I loved this movie! Not only does it take you through some of the most glamorous scenes and people in Hollywood's recent past but it is a sensitive exploration of a relationship between a famous father (Haskell Wexler) and his son Mark, who seeks to walk not exactly in his old man's footsteps but near enough that the synergy creates a delicious friction between them. It was like Vanity Fair in a therapy session. From beginning to end, my attention didn't waver a second."
1,hahahaha Schmaltzy Presumptuous People eating their own vomit !,"These ""folks"" make movies, think too highly of themselves for some foolish reason,THEN have the audacity to FILM themselves thinking out loud and sharing these. . . . . swollen notions or deeeeep perceptions. . . . for the rest of the viewingworld to somehow digest. PUKE!"
2,Corny,"This movie was very ""corny,"" low budget. I am very surprised that Ving Rhames was even in it. My husband order it to watch just out of curiousity. We were both disappointed with it.Ving is the split personality of another actor (no clue what his name was) who kills people. Drug/gang related movie. Too far fetched and cheesey for me. Ving is the only actor in the movie that I had even ever seen before."
3,Enjoyable book about one of the Right Stuff Astronauts,"I had fun reading this, but the author seemed to be guessing about some areas of Alan Shepard's life. Because Shepard himself never wrote an autobiography and gave few interviews, a lot of his life was loosely pieced together. It made me wonder if now, from beyond the grave, Shepard wishes he had just written a book himself so he could set the story straight! The lives of the 1st waves of astronauts is always interesting to read about, even though it was before my time. They were revered as celebrities and heroes, getting the covers of Life magazine, and ticker tape parades. This book does uncover some of the partying and hard living in Cocoa Beach that the newsmen of the day kept secret to protect the hero status of the astronauts."
1,"I Gave It 1 Star, 'Cause It Was The Minimum That I Could","Poorly written, riddled with inacuracies. If you reaal feel the need to read it, check it out from the library- it'll be much easier to return."
1,"I Gave It 1 Star, 'Cause It Was The Minimum That I Could","Poorly written, riddled with inacuracies. If you really feel the need to read it, check it out from the library- you'll be glad that you can easily return it."
3,"Decent enough, and long overdue biography of Shepard","On the one hand, this is a long-overdue biography of an American hero who never did make things easy for biographers. It shows us where Shepard came from, and how he wound up riding a fifteen-minute lob over the Atlantic, and playing golf on the moon, and it makes for fascinating reading.Unfortunately, the book is somewhat marred by numerous errors of detail that any expert on manned spaceflight history could have caught, and the occasional annoyingly awkward turn of phrase that any competent copy editor should have caught. Together, these give the author a less-than-authoritative tone. Then, too, even the typography of the book is slightly annoying: for the chapter titles and the page headers, somebody picked a truly ugly and amateurish-looking font, one that doesn't belong in any book."
3,"Hugely redundant, often incorrect","Not much about Al Shepard that isn't already in other booksand movies. And just plain wrong on obvious things likeGrissom's pickup --which is on tape. How do you screwsomething like that up? Short on technical detailsand a lot of rehash on the Glen rivalry.The constant repetitive mentioning of Al's sexual business is a bit weird.Especially since only two real instances are mentioned in the book,and neither of them involved sex. The supposed suppressed T.J. scandal(John Glenn saves the day) is total horsecrap too, never happened."
5,Awesome,My husband is obsessed with all things space travel. He loved this book. The book arrived in as-expected great condition and it arrived quickly. Thanks!
2,Marred by Errors,"This seems to be a decent enough biography that gives some insight into Shepard the man, his background and drives. However, I must caution that it contains many errors of fact that seem to be related to the author's apparent ignorance of the military, aviation and space. These errors range from niggling (referring to flying boats as ""seaplanes) to significant (stating that modern aircraft are controlled by a ""steering wheel"" rather that a stick and rudder pedals, when in fact a stick is still the preferred control for high-performance aircraft). The shame is that these errors could easily have been, and should have been, caught by proper review and editing - so the publisher has to take some of the blame."
5,Sooooo Good~!,"I also am very happy that Trisha wrote and explained where to find this CD. I also heard in on the music channel and fell in love with it.This surely must be a Typo here, as I'm thinking 19.99 would at least be reasonable.My copy arrived today from LRMP, and I'm enjoying listening to it now.Thanks again Trisha!!!"
5,wwe smackdown puzzle,"It was an inside joke gift for my boyfriend, he put it together quite easily and it was cute and fun. It got there very quickly."
5,who announces???,"I mean, I wish these reviewers would put down who the announcer was. I know that Howard Cossell called this fight along with Rocky Marciano, for ABC radio, back when Cossell was first becoming a broadcaster. Is this that broadcast?? I hope it is. I mean, If they would include info like that, maybe they would find it a little easier to sell these CDs. The fact that they don't include any information like that leads me to wonder if it might be some awfull ""re-inactment"" of the original announcement. I hope it is not one of those"
5,A True Feel of the Emerald Isle,What a joy ... just like finding a pot of gold under a rainbow! Marian Keyes has us longing for a return to the Emerald Isle with a fun book that is best read by sticking a finger in the pages and finding the start of a chapter!From an author who writes in bed readers will be transposed into the Irish mindset and if you really try you can slow the pace of your life and be one with the Irish for a moment or two.The anthology of columns shows that Marian's writing has great effect for a quickie read as well as being enveloped in her novels.
2,Sadly disappointed,Under the duvet was a series of very short stories or articles put together and called a book. I felt let down and wanted more.
4,Keyes reveals her secrets,"This is a collection of Marian Keyes's journalism and a few previously unpublished non-fiction pieces. Just as funny and self-deprecating as her novels, it offers a personal glimpse into the life of one of Ireland's most-loved authors. You can't help but come away with the impression that it would be lovely to have a girlfriend like her."
3,Saved by Irish wit,"This collection of rather pedestrian essays is saved from being a total loss by the Irish wit of its author, Marian Keyes. Her sarcasm and over-the-top wit help to punch up the humor in spots, but her essays are certainly not in the same category as other modern-day essayists. Many of us can relate to her experiences of flaky building contractors, marriage and family, and more, but all of this has been mined before. It wasn't a laugh riot, and it isn't really a must-read."
2,Disappointing,"I've liked or really liked most of Ms. Keyes' novels, but this book was a total disappointment. Boring and trite and totally not worth the money. Try her fiction stories instead."
2,Unbelievable,I can't believe the popularity of this author. Every conscious moment expressed. Such random dribble. This isn't even as interesting as just talking to a stranger in the checkout line.
5,It is the US Constitution,Quality made copy of our founding documents. Definitely a worthwhile thing to own for all liberty oriented citizens. Make sure to get everyone a copy so they can start learning our actual rule of law!
4,Not as small as i was expecting but still good,This product is very good and i would recommend it to any fellow american as resource for settling arguments between friends or even go into deep discussion about how the constitution should be improved to fit humanity as to what it is today.What it contains is:- The constitution of the united states of america ( stating the powers of the government as well as it's branches )- The Amendments ( 1-27 )- The Articles of Confederation ( The first constitution of the United States )- The Deceleration of IndependenceAll of the information i wanted was there in black and white and in small print. My only quarrel is that it wasn't pocket sized. Other than that though this product is great for any american looking to expand their knowledge of their own rights in the U.S.
5,Constitution Book,"It's the Constitution of the United States; what's NOT to love? The book is small, compact, clear and easy to read - I wanted that very thing to carry with me for easy reference and this is it. Great book and of course, love the content :)"
5,This is a classy little book.,"This is a classy little book to put on your coffee table. It is simply the constitution and Declaration of Independence. If you are a patriot, and want to refer to it often, keep it out."
5,Perfect book!,"A perfect book, small, convenient and informative. Every American should know their constitutional rights. This book provides just that for them."
5,Everyone should keep this handy,"As a Cato contributor for many years I've gotten copies of this great little book many times directly from them ""for free.""I keep a copy in my briefcase and have given other copies to friends and family. I can't count the number of times I've whipped this little book out and used it to discuss some fine point of what is in the Declaration of Independence or the Constitution.You can become a Cato contributor and get a free copy, or buy it in many places. Ironically the shipping costs on Amazon are higher than the price of new books that can be obtained in many places.An essential item in every house."
3,Weak binding taints an otherwise great pocket reference.,"Purchased this earlier this year to accompany me throughout my Constitutional Law class and beyond. Here, 5 months later, the binding has disintegrated. Several pages are falling out. It's a shame that it has floundered under the pressures of the academic's life I lead, for the booklet has been flawless otherwise. The paper is of high quality. The Cato info page at the end is entirely unnecessary, and is something I would expect from a free publication as opposed to this $5 item.Footnotes are sparse yet relevant. My only criticism is a lack of durability. Enjoy."
5,Must have,"Every student, every American needs to read this historic document. Keep it in your bookshelf for references when debating historical or political issues. A must have!"
2,Just Ok,"If you are looking for the true and original Constitution this is not it. This is the newer version, but it is ok if you want to read the present and updated book."
5,The Pocket Constitution,"I bought this for my husband, and he loves being able to carry the Constitution around in his pocket, and quick-reference information on a dime. I gave the other copy I bought to a dear friend."
4,It is small but it is okay,Even thought I did not expect a pocket size book.I welcome it. I can carry it around in my pants pocket.Great material. It is great to be able to pull thisreference book out to remind of recite the Declaration of Independence or the Constitution of the United States.
5,Perfect Companion,"This is simply the best, concise U.S. National Policy book available!Oh...and it isn't printed in China! (like some of the competitor's ""Little Red Books"")"
5,"Light, Compact, Durable and Easy to Use.","This is an invaluable reference source you can take anywhere. It's got the entire Constitution and Declaration of Independence with all the amendments. It is light (1.4oz), small (3&1/2""X5""X.225"")and made so well it should withstand lots of abuse before wearing out. The wrap-around cover appears to be made of a tough vinyl and the binding is very sturdy. The booklet is rounded, top and bottom on the right side for further resistance to wear.I often keep mine handy in a chest pocket as an argument stopper (or starter, heh heh) when needed. I've thumbed through it often for several months now and it shows no visible wear."
5,Great explanations of the Bill of Rights!,"Note: reviewing the Kindle version . . .The real value in this book is that it has explanations about recent case law, the popular and dissenting opinions, and implications of the Bill of Rights.Of course the book has much more than that, but as Americans our liberties are the most valuable asset we possess. This book is a good reminder of all the history, and how amazing the freedoms we have been gifted as American citizens are. I like to re-read the Constitution every few years, and this book, with its included annotations, is a good way to do that."
1,They're cool but...,"I bought these sandals to complete my soul reaper cosplay to a recent anime convention. They were cool and all, but they barely lasted. I missed a step going down stairs, slipped and the sandal broke! Before I even registered for the convention! I managed to EVENTUALLY tie it around my ankle to keep it on, but it didn't stay on well and was annoying the whole convention. If your buying this just for cosplay they work, but don't expect them to last very long."
5,The perfect tool,"This is exactly the right tool for cooking almost everything. The coating covers the entire spatula... there's no attaching of head to handle... no places for food to get trapped (or for the spatula to pull apart, as so many of mine have done in the past). I looked everywhere for a spatula that was one solid piece, and this is the only one I've found.It seriously doesn't retain any stains or odors. Makes a perfect omelet."
3,Slide all over my counter top...,"I have a wood benchtop and while I realise that the smooth surface may have something to do with this, these boards slide all over the place and frankly make cutting somewhat dangerous. This may not be the case for those people who do not have wood benchtops.However, they are very convenient for picking up, curling into a tube and depositing cut vegetables, especially onions, into a waiting pan. And the different colours for different food types is also good.Overall, great idea, but the silicone on the bottom needs to be a little more substantial."
3,okay,"Over time these have scratched heavily. However, they are nice and light and good for the kids' craft activities."
4,Flexible cutting boards - an essential kitchen accessory,"Have been using this style of cutting boards for the last 7-8 years. My first set of 3 similar boards were getting pretty beat up as of late, so I purchased this 4 pack to replace them. The new boards are an improvement as they are thicker but still flexible, which should keep them from curling, and they have one side that is non-skid so they stay in place while in use. Judging by the way these boards are made, I would guess that they should provide me with no less than 10 years of service before needing to be replaced, as my old ones made it for so long and were of lesser quality.If you use your kitchen regularly and don't have a set of this type of cutting boards, I would highly recommend that you get a set of these."
3,Good concept but....,"The concept of using different cutting areas for different foods is good, but I much rather cut on wood/bamboo than on these boards. I get the feeling that they won't last very long after enough slicing into them. I'll stick with a bamboo board for veggies and such, and then a thick plastic, easier-to-clean-and-disinfect board for meats. I've seen TV chefs use flexible boards like these to easily slide dry ingredients such as flour into a stand mixer, so I'll probably use them for that."
4,Good for what they are supposed to be,If you watch Alton Brown you will see he uses these less for cutting than for using them as scoops/funnel to add your flour to the kitchen aide mixer. I use them for that and for trimming meat/poutlty -then pop it in the DW to clean/sanitize.They do get a little bit bent after repeated swims in the dishwasher but still work fine
1,Fell apart in a month,"I loved loved loved these at first- they're cool, they're pretty, they store rolled up, and they make transferring veggies to the pot a snap. However, my opinion quickly changed. The sticky backing started rubbing off after a few weeks, and the boards do not stand up to use with a Chinese meat cleaver. Now, let me assure you that I was not overly rough with the boards. I always made sure that the backing was side down on the counter, I don't even own a dishwasher, I wash them with Seventh Generation all natural soap, which is extremely mild, and I followed all their directions. There's supposedly a guarantee, but I couldn't find a way to get in touch with the company, so it did me no good. So alas, it's back to old fashioned cutting boards for me! I would only suggest buying these if you don't cook a lot and only use them for light tasks like chopping vegetables."
2,Mine fell apart with little use,"I've seen good silicone sheets for cutting surfaces before, but these particular ones were brittle and fell apart from just a little usage (they cracked at the edges and tore). I suggest trying a different brand."
3,"Great, but temporary","Work well, easy to clean and store. Nice to have a color to use only for vegetables and another color mat for raw meat to avoid cross contamination. Get cut marks after 6 months to a year where I am concerned bacteria could hide from washing, but work well up to then."
3,Nice cutting mats,"Worth what I paid for them. I do wish there were more silicone backing for the non-slip performance. Flexible, thin, easy to clean. These are great!"
1,Warped and failed to stick,"I loved these for about two months. After that, they bent and would no longer lay flat, and the nonskid bottom was worthless. It's a good thing they were cheap because they were, well, cheap. I would recommend getting instead getting a good, solid cutting board and putting either a wet dishtowel under it or some of that nonskid shelf liner underneath. I also recently bought a real-size cutting board with nonskid ""feet"" on it that works great.Do yourself a favor and spend a little more money to get a quality item."
5,Well written,"Besides the usual detail related to the uncovering, this author does an excellent job of tieing the structures to the actual life of the citizens of Herculaneum prior to the envelopement. For example, using discovered documents he has a chapter describing the lawsuit described in those documents."
1,Very thin on information,"Book is poorly printed and contains very little actual study information. Lots of pages on how to take a test and some sample tests, then a few pages of accounting info that look to be printed on an old typewriter. Very difficult to read. Not worth the money at all."
5,Highly Creative--Best Thing to Come Along Since the Muppets,Do yourself a favor and buy all three of the Wallace & Gromit videos. They are spectacularly creative and funny. Highly recommended.
2,Seriously dissappointing!,"Was advertised to be 50 min. long. It was if you counted the special features garbage. My 5y/o could care less about the behind the scenes workings. In reality the ""movie"" was only about 20 mins. Was a total rip off and I will not be buying any ""Wallace and Grommit"" movies ever again."
4,This Guy Is weird,Typical humour that you can only get from someone from britain. The Adventures of Wallace & Grommit is really a very skillful and insightful use of animation and puppetry. Add to that typical British humour and you have a great piece of entertainment.
3,An Ok Movie,"It took our 3 year old and 5 year old a little while to get into this movie. I was concerned at first as to whether it was a good purchase. Then all of a sudden, they were actually watching it."
4,Do you want to succeed in business and have fun?,"This book has two themes that resonated strongly with me; 1) find your passion, and 2) get started. It is full of practical advice, compelling examples, and it has a wonderfully helpful section on finances that will appeal to even the most number-phobic readers. Read this book and save yourself months or years of running in the wrong direction with your entrepreneurial desires."
3,Eh.,"Somehow, this chocolate just really doesn't have much flavor. I'm not even any kind of a chocolate / candy snob, but this stuff just surprised me with how bland it was. I truly think a plain Hershey bar has more flavor. It's not BAD, it's just....nothing. Just vaguely sweet with little bits of almond. Tastes to me like the dark chocolate aspect is most definitely mostly sugar and little cocoa. Doesn't melt in the mouth quickly the way some other bars tend to. I gave it a shot, but I won't buy one again unless it was the last bar on the shelf and I was dying for a chocolate fix or something."
1,Poor reproduction of a classic,"This review is for the Kindle edition.I have heard about this book and was very excited to get a copy for my kindle. Unfortunately, the kindle edition appears to be a scan of the original text, which makes it very difficult to read. The kindle edition looked like a rush job. The ink is highly inconsistent and the typeface cannot be changed. Only the size can be changed, which does not make it any easier to read. After reading the first few pages I found it too much of a pain and decided to go through the whole text rapidly. It is a pity to see such a well known classic with such poor formatting offered for sale.I do not recommend this version until and unless the publishers re-format the book."
3,Not For the Average Person,"I was looking for a book on Saturn, but this one was not what I wanted. If you want one that's on a PhD level, then it might be just the book for you. But I wanted one that talked about Saturn using language that the average person uses. I was disappointed with this book. I'll keep looking. Someone majoring in psychology would probably like it . . . if they like to use a lot of words that would make their dept. chairman smile. Thanks, but no thanks."
2,Waste of time,While watching this I probably smiled less than the two mopy girls in the movie. I have no clue how this movie got such high ratings.
1,H O R R I B L E - Disgusting/ Immature humor,"Unless you're a 13-yr old boy, this movie isn't worth 10 minutes of your time - crappy characters that are a total turnoff, horrible story.I apologize that I am unable to give you a better description of this movie so that you will avoid watching this but I am at a loss for words this movie sucks on so many levels."
4,excellent review of verbs and verb tenses,"This five hour course is a continuation of the original Michel Thomas 8 hour introductory course, with this one focused on establishing a groundwork on verbs and verb tenses.Thomas socratic method of engaging the students and those listening is enjoyable, particularly when you begin to get the rhythm of the language and the answers begin to become natural. Though German is closely related to English, my own difficulty has always been the word order and sentence structure, and on this one aspect, Thomas was able to at least point me in the right direction.Verbs and verb tenses are the most important structure of a language, and the true value of the course is giving you a sense of familiarity with the topic, that one can use to look up specific topics in a grammar book or related resource."
3,interesting overview of Diana's life both as a child & adult,"I enjoyed this 2 disc set and found it enlightening about Diana Princess of Wales, but I was disappointed that it was all narrated. When I got it, I thought there might be some of the lyrics from her funeral but there was not. Overall, it was very good if you are looking for a historical prospective and want to learn about Diana, don't order it if you are looking for any music or coverage of her funeral."
3,the usual collection of mostly forgettable short stories,"Back in the 1960s Alfred Hitchcock put his name on several collections of murder-themed short stories. 'Once Upon A Dreadful Time' is one of those collections. It contains sixteen stories that are easy to read, mildly diverting and entirely forgettable. I sense these stories were never published elsewhere and were picked up and put in this book at a cheap price.Bottom line: unremarkable in every way. Not recommended."
4,excellent recipes and interesting info re Chaldean holidays,"I am an American woman who has been married to a Chaldean (Christian Iraqi) man for almost 30 years. This book has been very instrumental in teaching me to prepare Chaldean dishes. I have had many compliments from my Chaldean relatives on the dishes I have made using recipes from this book. Some of the instructions for the preparations are a bit wordy and the author's use of the English language is less than perfect, but she communicates her meaning. This book devotes several pages to a description of the celebration of the various Christian holidays in the Chaldean culture and explains how different foods are used at each time. I would be lost without this book in my kitchen - my copy is dog earred and well used!"
5,The ONLY Chaldean cookbook,"If you are interested in preparing great-tasting Chaldean/Assyrian food, get this book. It's the ONLY one that I know of on this subject. It also includes interesting facts about Chaldean holidays, etc."
1,Bad product,I purchased these brayers in good faith. They are lousy. The rubber rollers are not round and leave gaps in the relief block.I cannot recommend these to anyone at any level of printmaking skills.
4,Works - used slightly differently,I use this to spread glue on my woodworking projects. It does that nicely and cleans up easily. Handle is nice an heavy so I don't worry too much about breaking it.
4,Wonderful,"high quality, good clarity sound would recommend to anybody who enjoys opera. I saw this live and enjoyed DvD production almost as much (sub- titles good)."
4,I call it Freedom from the normal 9 to 5,"Outstanding book, gives you a step by step process on closing the gap from a job to your dream opportunity. We put here it be a blessing to each other, once you learn the things in this book and DO them, you will be able to share and be blessing and change others lives."
5,Excellent Resource - New to MLM,"As someone who is new to multi-level marketing, I found this book to be a great read! I highly recommend this book. The ideas/suggestions are very practical and easy to digest. Since the chapters have different authors, it exposes you to a wide range of experiences and writting styles. You won't be dissapointed![...]"
5,the ultimate guide to network marketing,it is very good. i like that it gives you information and inspiration at the same time.
5,Ultimate Review for the Ultimate Guide to Network Marketing,"Great collection of methods, ideas, secrets and plans from 37 of the top network marketers in the world. Too bad I can only give it five stars, it deserves 5 stars 37 times!Greg ArnoldGreg-Arnold.com"
5,This is the Ultimate Book in my opinion,"I have been with a network marketing company for four years. This book is a great resource to solidify beliefs, to understand where you may be strong and where you may find you need improvement. Best of all, it gives you examples, ideas and advise from the people who have been ( and still are ) at the top in this business. Love it! I will read it again and again and share it with others."
2,Sinister six,"I just started reading this book and I just wanted to let anyone interested in buying it know, it has a LOT of typos. I'm on chapter three and I count about half a dozen typos so far. If this bothers anybody or if anybody is a stickler for this type of thing, I don't recommend this book"
3,Good machine can be improved,This one lasted almost 4 years. It's the only yogourt maker available here (in BC) that makes 1 and 2 litre batches instead of fussy little ones. The heating coil can't be adjusted so it eventually fails to deliver enough heat. Yogourmet provides a 2 litre container which is a bit too large and unwieldy for me. They flatly refuse to provide a one litre container. The nearest I can find is a 940 mL yogourt container so I have to waste 60 mL with each batch. (Milk comes in 1L containers here.) The price is a bit high for what you get.
4,would recommend this,"I followed the directions in booklet which are very minimal, but sufficient. After checking online, I learned that adding 1/2 cup of dry milk to milk before boiling and instead of using a ""starter kit"", I used 5 Tablespoons of Stoneyfield Farm plain yogurt that has six live cultures in it(mixed with a little cooled milk then added to rest of milk). I let it incubate for 5 hours and it was nice and thick.Would be nice it they included a few recipes."
2,Needs a thermostat,"It has taken making several batches to figure out just how to make this thing work without getting the mixture TOO HOT. I have found that leaving the top off and placing a dish towel over it works, at least for now. That may change with the seasonal changes since my house is cooler in the winter. It needs a thermostat! I would not buy it again."
5,Easy Yogurt,"I am so happy I purchased this Yogurt maker. I have been making yogurt for years in all sorts of ways. Coolers, heating pads warm oven....This is just so compact and easy! Not to mention the tub goes straight to the fridge, so convenient. This came with everything I needed except of course the milk and starter. Just a great product that will get lots of use."
2,The thermometer that comes with sucks.,"As I was warming my milk I couldn't figure out why it wouldn't heat above 120... causing me to slowly keep turning up the heat... and scalding the milk..... Finally AFTER I decided I was about to give up because the milk wouldn't get hot enough, I put my own personal meat thermometer in and it said 180!! The thermometer is WRONG! And no, I wasn't looking at the celcius numbers, I was looking at the farenheit numbers. GR! Will see how well the yogurt maker works."
2,Wanted to love it.,"I wanted to love this. We eat a LOT of yogurt.I first purchased this:[...]And it worked AWESOME!One time.Then it died.I sent it back and got this one. And I have made four or five batches in this thing,first letting it cook for 4 hours, last night I let it cook for 8 - SAME consistency. RUNNY!I used their yogurt starter, I used powdered milk, I used gelatin, I used brand name yogurt for a starter.I have tried everything.The yogurt comes out like Kefir, which is great for smoothies, etc. but how do I make it firm up?Can anyone help?"
3,Godd priduct,I am very happy with this product. It makes excellent yogurt. I only wish it had a timed off option.
4,Pleased w/ results and research of this product,"I purchased the Yogourmet yogurt maker to make the 24 hour yogurt for the specific carbohydrate diet. So far so good, have make several batches of yogurt. it works well and it easy to use. I would suggest using at least 1 or 2 % milk, when i use skim milk it comes out w/ a lot of liquid but that may be due to having to ferment the yogurt for 24 hours. I am using Fage total greek yogurt or dannon plain yogurt as starter culture, but am planning to get a dried yogurt culture starter b/c i heard it yeilds best results. I especially like the cheesecloth, the yogurt cheese (dripped yogurt) is great and very versitile."
4,Mostly awesome,This yogurt maker is awesome. It lost one star only because it's a little splashy sometimes removing the yogurt from the resevoir. But the final product is great. Get one now! Now!
2,Disappointment,"Sorry but this will not be a favorable review. This is my first time using Yogourmet electric yogurt maker. I've tried it twice and so far have not come out with a satisfactory yogurt. Originally I bought a Salton -- used it faithfully for two years and then it died. So I thought I would try Yogourmet, but I'm disappointed. I will give it another try just to be sure it's not my mistake. The yogurt was too loose both times and I increased the time limit thinking that might be the problem. Didn't seem to make a difference, the increased time just made it more tart."
3,product fine,the yogurt maker works exactly as promised but I found out I am not a yogurt maker. I need to leave to professionals.
1,Yogourmet,"So far, I have thrown out 4 batches of milk trying to make yogurt. Not very happy with this appliance."
2,Worked well but died.,The product is well constructed of good quality plastic and is simple but works well. The thermometer is too small to easily read (for an older person). Unfortunately the heating element died in mine after one week of use. I'm returning it and will update the review after the replacement arrives.
1,not good for warm climates,Did not mention anywhere that the temperature of your home must be between 68-72 degrees for it to maintain the correct temp. There was a small insert that came with the machine. No use to someone living in warm climates unless you have a monster air conditioner. I cooked my bacteria trying to make yogurt. A thermostat would really help!
5,Love it !,"I bought this to make salt rising bread starter and it works perfect. I like that it has a single fill container and that it doesn't have an automatic shut off. It kept the starter at the perfect temp. the entire 2 days. I haven't made yogurt with it yet, but I'm confident that it will work."
3,9 month review for Yogurmet yogurt maker,"The maker has fins on the inside (which hold the container off the bottom)which make it very difficult to wipe the inside clean, with crud accumulating in the corners.I strongly recommend buying an extra container (even if it is overpriced) and not over-filling it. The lid snaps shut, but it has also come loose while in the maker, and while trying to lift the full container in and out of the maker, with disastrous results. Instead of relying on the knob built into the container top, I try to grasp it by the sides, but there is very little clearance. It is always a ""hold-your-breath' moment. Otherwise, I have no complaints with this unit."
1,stopped working after 4 batches of yogurt,"The machine functioned alright the first couple of times. Now the internal temp regulation does not work and it heats up quickly and cooks the culturing milk turning it into a vinegary whey and hard, rubbery curds using the expensive ABC culture packets. Gets up to 140."
2,Gets too hot!,"I have owned my Yogourmet for one year and have only made a few batches with it. Tonight after finishing a batch, I measured the temperature of the yogurt. It was 120 degrees F. It is supposed to incubate at 100 degrees F.This is greatly detrimental to those who are on the SCD diet and need properly prepared yogurt."
3,Glass replacement jar,"Has anyone replaced the plastic container with a glass jar? One review I read said that a yolite glass jar worked. After much searching I think I found what they were referring to, yolife glass jars! Can anyone confirm this and comment if it fits correctly? Or if you know where to find other glass replacements, please advise. Thanks!"
2,"Slightly defective, but still good yogurt","The yogurt maker comes with a digital thermometer. However, when I opened the box, the thermometer was switched to the on position and the included battery was totally drained. That's an unacceptable failure of QC.Still, the yogurt was tasty once I bought a new battery."
5,My favorite small appliance!,"I've had the Yogourmet yogurt maker for about 6 months now and love it. No, it has no bells or whistles, but it works! Yes, I have to heat my milk and cool it, but once I've added it to the Yogourmet yogurt maker I can just leave. Three hours, four, five - whenever I come back I can open the lid, tilt the bucket and judge if it's done. I use my own starter (from the previous batch) and have never had a bad batch. I used a crockpot before this, and never felt comfortable with it, plus created some pretty ugly (though edible) yogurt. One example was my ""cottage yogurt,"" curdy lumpy stuff which tasted ok but definitely wasn't nice. What I get from this yogurt maker is a nice thick, delicious product that I enjoy daily.Simple is beautiful!"
4,My Yogourmet from Amazon,"I'm getting used to making yogurt, and liking it, thanks to the Yogourmet from Amazon. The only drawback is removing the full container from its ""bath"" when it is done, but I can't think of a better way of designing it, since it has to be a snug fit, for it to keep a steady warmth. I do like the large size very much, and it was because my sister had one that I decided the large size is the way to go, for me. I eat a lot of yogurt, and the closer to real the better, no added stuff, and nothing synthetic. I have had good results, taste-wise, but it is drinkable, not thick. I am enjoying getting used to it, and experimenting a little. It is really very simple to do, and sits nicely out of the way while it is ""cooking."" Thank you, Amazon, for a good deal! I couldn't find it cheaper anywhere else."
5,Does what says,"Had this a month now and use it nearly twice a week as I've taken to making smoothies for breakfast. It's easy, quick and makes good yogurt."
2,Faulty device or faulty design?,"The device worked like a charm. I made perfect yogurt every week for about nine months. But, I found water running down the electrical cord when I dried it after making yogurt. I ignored it for quite a while -- until my husband said that it was dangerous to mix water and electricity. With a shake, we could hear water in the exterior base of the maker. I did not exceed the water level for the 2 quart processing, but water was overflowing or condensing during processing and leaking into the unit at the top lip where the lid rested. Since the exterior casing included the electrical wires, we had a problem. We tried to seal the rim, but that didn't work. We ended up discarding the device."
2,Runs hot,"Keeps the milk at too high a temp. Curdles every time. Better off just using non-electric means (blanket, oven pilot light, cooler) to insulate and keep the yogurt at incubating temp."
1,Does not work!,I was so excited to get this batch yogurt maker. The first one lasted three batches and then quit heating. I ordered a replacement. The replacement overheated and ruined the first batch. Either I have really bad luck or this product sucks. I've looked for a replacement batch yogurt maker and there are no other brands available. I don't want to clean little jars. I want a batch yogurt maker. Does anyone have any suggestions?
1,Do not waste your time...,"The author must have come from the late 90's when everyone was ""successful"" in the dot com game. Everything in this book is common sense. Special things that are revealed makes no sense. If this is really the CTO of Perot Systems, then Ross Sr. really needs to look at where he is spending his money.The author has no depth in this subject matter. The article read like a boiler plate presentation that was thrown together for a conference where no one is listening.There are so many better books on this topic that this should NOT be on your list."
3,So-so,"I honestly don't use it that much, but when I do, it gets the job done. My biggest complaint is that the pop-off cap on the top doesn't stay on very well - it seems to slip off easily. That's only really a problem when storing it, though. I haven't had rust problems as mentioned in another review."
5,Great Overall View,"This book offers a great overall view on racism throughout the world. It doesn't just focus on the holocaust in europe and slavery in the south. The authors have various backgrounds in education (English, History, Anthropology), and combined give this book a wider perspective viewpoint. You get various articles (first and second hand accounts; some historical interpretation), glorious photos, and also guide you should you want to konw more about a particular thing.Highly recommended to anyone wanting a greater understand of our world today and why/how racism will always be a constant problem."
2,I have clear breathing ...,"This book has been one of the best things I have done for myself in years. I have had a stuffed up head and sinus condition for decades. Doctors give me medicine, which does not deal with the cause and creates other problems.I find I have an allergy to corn and wheat, which appears to be in everything and after less than a week of eliminating corn and wheat I can breathe clearly and deeply and I don't cough in the mornings. I am thrilled. I am working with the book and checking out dairy products too.I was not looking for a diet book; however I lost alittle weight already too."
4,Goofy whips some a@*,"Goofy has never been this fun. Plus, you get to skate around as his son Max. The both have different ways to do moves. Anyway, bottom line, I was surprised at how good the graphics are and my nephew is having fun wtih it. Typically, Disney puts out some good educational games, but this is just pure fun."
3,It was very informative but did not give the information I n,I was doing a report on pisces and it did not give me the information that I needed.
1,huh??,Why am I getting asked to review this? i didn;t order this. This is something my mom ordered...not me. Please ask her to review this.
3,A good two years,"I bought this about two years ago and yesterday it finally died on me. However, I did use it a a lot, like 4 times a week at least. It did the job, though loud as heck, and the spout was useless. I could not unscrew the bottom also. It was so clogged that it was impossible to unscrew to clean the base. I would not buy the back to basics for the spout. But the best thing is the stir stick, which is terrific and the best thing about this manufacturer. All blender companies should take note. Now that mine died, I kept the stir stick and bought a warring blender that is about 10 times faster than this one.If you buy a budget blender and can get a few years use out of it, that's par for the course. You simply just get a new one. I've used the Vitamix blender costing 500. But these budget blenders will chop ice just fine."
2,Boring!,"OK, maybe I'm being a little too harsh. I actually enjoyed the idea of the cross-country motorcycle ride, the details about motorcycle mechanics, and especially the portrayal of the narrator's relationship with his son. The son was the best part of the whole book. Unfortunately, there wasn't much space for sonny, because dad was too busy advertising the author's brilliant philisophical insights. Even more unfortunately, the insights weren't brilliant, and consumed hundreds of tedious pages. It occured to me to wonder whether the author was trying to make the point that the narrator was a pompous idiot; however, the intent seemed to be for the reader to be blown away by the brilliance of the narrator's philosophical insights, and hence by the brilliance of the author who conceived of the narrator and the philosophical insights. I can't believe I made it through 380 pages of this."
4,Neat,"For those who are unfamiliar with philosophy, this is a very accesible book with some nice insights.It reads like a train (although you might want to pause once in a while to think about some paragraphs).It is a bit outdated, and I have some personal remarks concerning a few topics."
4,Difficult but worthwhile reading!,"The author and his son Chris travel from Minnesota to California by motorcycle. At first they are accompanied by another couple, but, a bit later, father and son are left to continue their journey alone. Throughout the trip, the author is deep in thought which is reflected in the paucity of communication with his son and more communication with himself alone.A reader involved with this book must either have great fortitude or a fervent interest in philosophy to make it to the end of the story. Despite its haunting quality, its philosophic meanderings are often overwhelming for the casual reader. Best reserved for a reader who likes to ""work"" at reading, ZEN AND THE ART OF MOTORCYCLE MAINTENANCE, is a sad but profound story of philosophic theory, mental illness, and a father-son relationship which will leave a deep impression on those willing it struggle through it."
4,Hard to follow...but not so bad,"To some extent I can agree with another reviewer that said this book was incredibly boring. But I basically attribute this to that fact that I did not quite get what the author was trying to say to me. Perhaps this is because I'm young and inexperienced in life or maybe it's because I have no experience in philosophy and therefore had no idea where he was coming from. This is a book that I will have to read again in a few years and then hopefully it will make more sense to me.In the end I walked away with something very valuable and I don't regret one bit that I suffered through all 418 pages. If you want an easy read...don't read this book!! If you are currently going through a time in your life where you're being very introspective and at the same time are feeling critical of the culture around you, then I would definitely recommend this book."
4,Hard to read but Compelling!,"This book is not an easy read, and I'm not certain that I understood everything that it was trying to say, but I agree with Robert Pirsig's basic message about quality, which is that it's not only in the observer, nor is it solely in the object. Quality is something that occurs when something is done consciously...okay this is not quite right. But in my defense, the author had trouble defining exactly what quality is. If you really want to know, read the book!Karen L. Jett, CMA - Author Grow Your People, Grow Your Business"
4,Hang in there...it's worth it!,"I listened to this on tape and have to admit, I would have struggled to get through if I tried to read it. This book raised some important issues and did it in an entertaining and thought provoking way. I enjoyed the back and forth between past and present, the references to Greek philosophy and the telling of the journey itself. I cared about Phaedrus and his son. After listening to it I did buy the book just to be able to go back over some of the parts that had so many layers. It seems people have a strong reaction to this book because when I asked the bookstore clerk where I could find Zen, another customer joined the conversation to tell me how many times he had read it. This book also caused me (and my books on tape group) to listen to Lila, his follow-up novel which continues Phaedrus' story years later. It was also one of the books the group has listened to that generated the most discussion."
3,"OK, but not groundbreaking if you've ever had Philosophy 101","I had heard a lot about this book and finally had a chance to read it. Definitely not what I thought it would be; really, with several philosophy classes under my belt from a long-passed undergrad, I found it to be annoyingly extended and rambling. The Kubric-esque twist the narrator reveals may have been cutting-edge reading in the mid-70s, but has been done many, many times since. As a bit of a classical-leaning individual myself, as well as being a motorcyle rider, I found the technical deficiencies to be distracting.I would not recommend this book to someone wanting to learn about Zen, Buddhism, or even basic gestalt psychology. But if you have a general interest in basic philosophy, especially that of romanticism vs rationalism, then definitely give this a read."
1,Illogical,"Another reviewer said that people who don't like this book would be people who want a lot of action in their novels. Booo! Low blow. I enjoy reading philosophy, but this book was awful. The author is just plain illogical. He draws ridiculous conclusions. If you are going on a journey of the mind, you should not have a guide who is incapable of thinking straight. If you love this book, then you will be very comfortable with illogical statements and I recommend you read a book on logical thinking."
1,Stupidity and Beyond,"When I take an account of the things that were a complete waste of my time in this lifetime, this book will be in the top ten. What a bunch of self-absorbed gibberish. In the beginning, when there were some real references to motorcycle parts, I was actually interested, thought there might be some nice analogy and life lessons to be examined. Nope. Turned into one long megalomania rant. I loathed this guy by the end of the book and wished I could have reported him to CPS for his lack of parental skills. Hiking up a steep grade and NO WATER? What a moron. Maybe the incredibly poor nutrition may have been 90% of this guy's problems.Presently, I live in a university town and the author reminds me of oh so many of the instructors who THINK they really have something to say...and everyone else KNOWS they don't. And shame on every teacher who assigned this in a sorry attempt to stroke their own ego. Don't waste your time with this book."
5,2nd copy of this book,"I read this book when I was 18 and though it was an interesting read then, now that I'm 40, this book has deeper meaning for me. I've gone back and re-read different portions of this book a few times and have actually applied some of what I've learned from the book to my life."
5,A philosophical ride,"The style is flat and uninteresting; but this is a fascinating quest, in fiction form, about what philosophers have said about Quality. The search is interwoven with the central character's journey on a motor cycle across the United States, with the landscape symbolizing the quest (e.g. ruminations about the most difficult philosophy while he is in the rarefied air on very high mountains)."
5,great book,This is a great book and very moving. A bit sad and pretty deep. For those who are new to zen and some of these concepts it is very significant.
5,Changed my life.,"I read Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance in the 1970's. It was hard to read at times and yet I could not get enough of it. This is one of the books that changed the direction of my life and how I look at the world. I love having it on my Kindle, to refer to,and reread it, much like I do with Moby Dick also on my Kindle."
3,A good book but where is the zen???,I have read the book. I put the five not so much becuase of the book itself but rather because of what I thought it would contain. I am only eighteen but I have mixed feelings about the book. First of all I plan on majoring in religious studies and the original reason I read the book was to read about zen. I found little of that there if any really and I was very dissapointed. The objection I have to this book isn't the actaul story because that does make you think which is something few books seem to do for me but rather the fact that you can find it under zen buddhism in a library. I would rather have it under philosophy. It changed me to the extant that a well written book changes anyone but it lacked faith. That I think is why americans like it so much. . . maybe. then again I am an american too so who knows? it is ineresting. go for it if you can't decide.
2,I tried,"Wow... where to begin. I can count on the fingers of one hand the number of books I've started but not finished. It's just not something I do. However, I quit on this book about half-way through. Some of the reasons were the author's fault; no doubt some were mine. I don't know that I was fully prepared for what this book ultimately is... a deep, drenching immersion into philosophy, metaphysics, quality of life, and personal self-worth. Writing about those things is a fine and admirable endeavor, but for me reading Pirsig's tortuous and complex prose just didn't work a majority of the time. He would sporadically grab me with a particular line of thought, only to veer off and lose me (interest-wise) for pages on end. I was far more attentive to the cross-country motorcycle trip than I was to his meandering ""Chautauqua"". In the end what made me put this book down was that I just wasn't interested enough in the subject matter. So, before you begin this book be sure of what you've undertaken."
1,Typical Boomer Indulgence,I thought this book would be interesting and thoughtful but instead it seems to be more of the usual meism that permeated the Boomer generation and has so negatively affected my own generation. No wonder we're all screwed up!
2,Zen,"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance is a very difficult, but helpful book. Although it may not be the most exciting or entertaining story, the concepts discussed by Pirsig in this book are very helpful in learning many of life's important lessons. The way Pirsig approaches his ideas is also somewhat peculiar and confusing, yet he will always find a way to tie up any mixed up thoughts. He has an interesting outlook on how the concepts he explains pertain to almost every aspect of a person's life, and he uses them when performing maintenance on his motorcycle. On Robert and Chris Pirsig's journey across the country, they face their fair share of difficulties between each other that they must overcome. At the end of the book, Chris begins to see a split personality in Robert who is deeply taken by the teachings of Phadreus, an ancient philosopher. The conquering of this and many other troubles also teaches readers important lessons about people's relationships."
2,Brave enough not to like this classic,"Two stars! One for Pirsig putting pen to paper (all 514 dull pieces of them) and one for the apposite title. If Zen is patience, then I came damn close. What strength it took to not banish this book to my `begun but not finished' bookshelf. A dull pontification on the definition of `quality' (which is ironically lacking in the novel), and an unlikeable narrator who exemplifies the `genius is madness' slogan. His philosophical ramblings are not profound, just disturbed. And hellishly boring."
2,A Philosophy Lecture Posing as a Novel,"As an aspiring novelist with a degree in english and philosophy, I find it disheartening to find philosophy lectures thinly disguised as novels (Lila, Sophie's World -- could that title have slyly been borrowed from Sophie's Choice?). Also, Persig, in his so-called quest, refuses to acknowledge such modern philosophers as Nietzche, Kierkegaard, Sartre, Camus, or even Rand. He also doesn't attempt to create a synthesis between eastern and western philosophy, as the title would suggest. Herman Hesse, for example, does manage an intriguing blend of eastern mysticism with western philosophy -- he is greatly influence by Nietzsche. Persig's prose is often flat, but his protagonists are very driven in their quest for metaphysical quality. But as characters, they don't -- for me, seem very interesting. If the reader is interested in the philosophical novel, may I suggest reading Sartre, Camus, Hesse, Rand, Mann, Dostoievsky, or Tolstoi."
5,Amazing book.,"This book has changed the way I look at the world from a high philosophical level to a low practical level, and everywhere in between. Plus it is a great story. I loved it."
4,peace of mind,"I've read this book 3 times. First time was a abridged audio book, I loved it. Years later I read a paperback book. I liked it. Today I finished a unabridged Audio book and I loved it once again. This is a book I'll go back to over and over. Each time I've gotten something new out of it, and next time I'll get something new again. This book for me isn't just a philosophy book, it's also a self-help book. Many days I think I must be crazy, I see things so differently than others. This book reminds me why that's not a bad thing."
5,It is a 'quality' read,"Very curious and unusual read. I was fascinated by the range of knowledge Pirsig possesses about motorcycles and at the same time about how multidimensional and deep Phaedrus can think.It is a great read, it inspires, more in depth readings and kindles that thirst for more knowledge into deeper sides of it. I definitely am intending to explore the Zen philosophy soon!!"
5,wonderful.,"After readingTen Thousand Miles by Freight Train: A Memoir of Beauty and Freedom on the Rails, I was looking for more writing by poet-philosophers on wild adventures; this book fit the bill quite nicely. Vicarious adventure and deep thoughts, nature and zen; a wonderful combination of which I will never tire."
4,Not at all what I was Expecting,"This book was great. Definitely made me aware of trends in my life that I hadn't previously thought about.While it was written more than 30 years ago, the lessons are still very applicable to society today."
4,"there is treasure here, just have to dig for it.","Found this hard to get into the first time I tried to read it, took awhile to warm to the material. worth the effort to get warmed up."
5,Life up close,Really is very important to remember to smell the roses..the joy is in the journey. I'll always treasure my days as a biker..both riding and repairing..
4,Still reading it but very inspiring,"I purchased this on Amazon as an e-book to read on my iPad mini through the Kindle app. It reads very nicely and if you're the existential, adventurous wonderlust type like me then you'll definitely like having this one in your bag to draw inspiration from the words and the message. It's a timeless novel."
1,A Pseudo-intellectual Classic,"A pseudo-intellectual classic for people who can't handle real philosophy. The characters are wooden and annoying, the philosophical ""lessons"" are bad, and the pacing is atrocious. I met a woman years ago who thought that metaphysics was the study of ""ESP and stuff."" Zen and the Art would be perfect for her. For those interested in reading real philosophy, I recommend Martin Heidegger's The Fundamental Concepts of Metaphysics: World, Finitude, Solitude (Indiana University Press, 1995). Don't worry about reading Being and Time right away, just enjoy The Fundamental Concepts of Metaphysics. When you finish, you'll never want to read pop-philosophical kitsch like Zen and the Art again."
3,good but..,probably the most over-hyped book of all time....i like practical books..check out Live Like A Fruit Fly - also on amazon
3,"Interesting, but not impressive","I found the premise of this book interesting. But did not obtain the sense of satisfaction many other readers have. Frankly, I'm puzzled by the devotional, almost fanatical following this book has. I would categorize it as one of the first 'New Age' psychobabble texts which have filled bookshelfs of the past several years."
5,25 Years old yet Eternal in Message,"When you finally get through this book, possibly needing to read it several times to fully comprehend what is being said, you will be left in a daze."
3,"This is not an essay, this is a case report.","This book offers interesting questions and interesting points of view. It does not contain answers.This book will tell you more about the mental state/mental disorder of the author then about philosophy and zen.It is Pirsig's psychoanalysis session put on paper.While it is worth reading, expect to doubt the science/philosophy part, especially if you are familiar with science/philosophy."
2,This Cycle Sputters,"This book was nothing but trouble for me, and perhaps it was because I hadn't expected it to be such a heavy work of philosophy. There are moments when the book is more of a narrative, but by and large, it's a philosophy book in the guise of fiction. It's much higher quality than something like The Celestine Prophecy, but not exactly unlike it in the way it wants you to see the world in a different way.I got 2/3 through it and that's all. Most people who read this book seem to love it, so my reaction seems to be atypical. But hey, a reaction is a reaction."
1,Don't read beyond the title,"What a great title. And even an intriguing concept...explaining zen via the motorcycle. Unfortunately, the book turns out to be a long winded narcissistic lecture by a person you wouldn't want to be stuck in a car with, never mind a motorcycle. Don't waste your time. Take a mindful walk instead."
3,so far...,"I've read about a third to a half of this book, and...1. The author/narrator is very grandiose. Always looking for what's 'wrong' with this or that, and having no answers. The problem is that his 'what's wrongs' are pretty sophomoric.2. Add to that that he is a very meticulous/rhetorical guy, and you get a lot of droning.3. Throw in sappy storytelling of the kind... 'well this is where my pen landed, it has to be included'... and you may just find yourself annoyed fairly often.What's good? So far his classic/romantic constructs are pretty interesting. But there's a lot of times he's flaking out in his way and it's not fun."
2,Expected more...,"Perhaps the most overrated book in pop culture. Interesting, yes, definitely. A treatise of philosophical merit or anything of any philosophical interest certainly not. Reading it will only confuse and over simplify what the great thinkers such as Kant tried to achieve. Likely this book says the most about what can happen when an intelligent person lives in a small Western college town."
1,"""ZZZZZZZZZZZZ.........""","I am listening to this book on audio tape, and I am surprised that given the ""classic"" status of the book, how it is so incredibly boring. The ""philosophy"" is not particularly interesting, as is the motorcycle trip itself. Every time I have put the book on to listen to, I have fallen asleep."
1,Yawn,"I don't know if it's the philosophical subject matter, the slow pace of the prose or the motorcycle theme, but I kept actually falling asleep while reading this book! It must be rewarding to finish it, but I am afraid I will never get there because it's just not worth my time."
3,problematical to assess,"This book is among the most problematical for me to assess. On the one hand, it seemed overwhelmingly ""honest"" to me when I first read it. On the other hand, I've read a great deal of philosophy since then, and the initial book now seems trivial by comparison. The book at least provides stimulus to a reader's thoughts, but then once the reader has grown, he may disavow the original catalyst. The book is too serious for the general reader but too lightweight for a serious student of philosophy. The narrative of the cross-country motorcycle trip is alternately compelling and lackluster. The tone and style of writing is colloquial, which may or may not agree with the reader. Overall, then, I give the book a three-star rating, mainly on account of its quality to stimulate the general reader (and it is the general reader to whom the book is addressed) into thinking about metaphysics and modern society."
5,"Had to have it on Kindle, too","I just love the book. I had the paper version, but wanted to have it with me wherever I go.Not an easy read, though, but it opens many questions about modern society ... phylosophy interspersed with everyday life"
4,Very interesting,"Great read. Definitely a little more philosophy than I was expecting, and surprisingly little zen. But a great and thought provoking read."
4,It's not about motorcycle maintenance!,"My friend picked this book up thinking its about motorcycle maintenance. I bet the most folks know by now that it's not. At all. It's an interesting book to read, there are a lot of engaging philosophical discussions in the book, although I have to admit that in some places it's incredibly painful (or boring) to read. I did enormously enjoyed and liked the discussion of the nature of quality. If I ever teach again, I will make parts of the book a required reading."
5,A truly mind-expanding book,"I am an engineer that has been doing some soul searching for about a year now. I came about this book and just consumed it. It spoke to so many things that I have been feeling, and helped me open new areas for existential exploration. A must read for anyone who just can't put their finger on IT, whatever IT is. The perspective the author presents is not necessarily the correct one, but it helped me learn more about my perspective on life and living."
4,"Excellent. Very literally, ""thought provoking"".","I first read this book in the early '70's, when I was reading many of the pop philosophy classics of that time and culture. It delighted me in it's simple pursuit of truth with it's arguments skillfully presented in metaphor. I felt that it stood head & shoulders above most of the sophomoric propaganda being touted at the time. I was extremely surprised to read some of the negative reviews printed here. I can only assume that these people ""just didn't get it"", or weren't really interested in doing any original thinking."
4,"Good, Intense. I will read it again.","RP has done a very good job. He is the types who think a lot, just because they can. He has gone into the depths of some issues and torn them apart until he figured out the cause. Your experiences might have lead you to think about those issues. In that case, you will not be completely impressed but will still feel good. But, if you have not spent too much time contemplating, this book will be an eye-opener. It carries you into the heart of the matter.He is very sharp and intelligent. He is a pleasure to read. His eye for detail is refreshing. At times, while reading the book, I felt he was sharing my experiences. He is good. No doubts here."
5,What a book!,This book was reccomended by my choir teacher and it is the greatest book I've ever read. It has changed my outlook on things and has effected me in unexplainably ways as well. I'd give this book to anyone and thanks again S.V.
2,Not all that it's cracked up to be,"My philosophy course at university was exciting and dynamic and opened my eyes and mind to all manner of different ways of thinking about the world. Imagine my disappointment, therefore, when I finally got round to reading 'Zen and...' to find a subject I had loved as a student presented in such a messy and disjointed way. I'm sure Mr Pirsig means well, and there are a number of passages in his book (well, 2 or 3) which caught my attention, but when I'd finished I was left wondering what all the fuss was about. Essentially, having put the book back on the shelf, I can readily understand why 121 publishers turned it down. (What I find harder to understand is why no.122 accepted it!) Probably I should give the book another chance, but, to be honest, I feel I have better things to do with my time."
2,An over-rated and disappointing work,"When I studied philosophy at university, it was exciting and dynamic, and opened my eyes and mind in ways I'd never thought possible. Imagine my disappointment, therefore, when I read this highly-acclaimed work. Having heard so much about it, I wanted to like it, I really did, but, oh dear. All I can say is I'm glad Mr Pirsig wasn't one of my university tutors, for, barring a couple of passages, he succeeds only in turning a wonderful area of human experience into a cure for insomnia. I'll come back to 'Zen...' again some time in the future and hope for better things, but, for the time being, I have to consign it to my 'Most Disappointing Books' pile."
1,Mental Games,"The author constantly defends his head games by trying to explain why people dislike head games, but this does not make the head games any more palatable. What a book. The other one star reviews have said it all: boring, dry, heady, rambling, burdensome, sluggish, heavy. And if that weren't enough, it's got mid-life-crisis written all over it.The one thing that really gets me is the author's note at the beginning:""What follows is based on actual occurrences. Although much has been changed for rhetorical purposes, it must be regarded in its essence as fact...""Are you kidding?Personally I say you're much better off - philosophically, spiritually, logically, rationally, romantically and in terms of quality - reading the Gita, or a Michael Chrichton thriller.Two thumbs the heck down for Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance."
3,Moby Dick and Time?,"My immediate reaction after reading this book was one of ambiguity: Moby Dick and Time? Reality, the white whale, or rather, the ghost of rationality, manifests itself as the insuperable and the innocent so cleverly in this book and yet, through the archeology of memory, time too is added into the formula. Is the ""inquiry"" skimpy or economic? A second reading made me see that the unnecessary development of certain theories through both the narrative and the analysis were bogging the true ideas down so much that synthesis is literally impossible in such a short space. And so, philosophically, the book contributes little. But then, taking the narrative events and the rather intriguing semiotic treatment of memory, an artistic lustre becomes apparent. It is unfortunate that Prisig chose to write a ""chautauqua"" instead of a novel."
1,Awful!,"Maybe I was expecting too much. What would it focus more on: Zen or motorcycles? I'm interested in both topics, yet this book came nowhere near to satisfying me on either of them.Zen and the art of Motorcycle Maintenance was a huge disappointment for me. I totally concur with the sentiments in the review by the guy from Seattle.I finished this book feeling depressed and disheartened, and all the way through it I wondered why there was hardly any love shown to the author's son.If you want to find out about Zen, buy a copy of Zen made Easy by Timothy Freke. If you're new to bikes, buy magazines or visit your local two-wheeler store and get advice from the experts.I could have gone for a hike, played a round of golf, painted the house or, better still, gone for a ride on a motorcycle - pastimes far more worthy of my time than reading this depressing, prolix book."
1,Life is Too Short,"I remembered liking this book when I was 20. I bought it recently at a library sale and was excited to re-read it after more than 2 decades of (cough, cough) wisdom. Usually when I have read books that made an impression on me in my earlier years (I'm thinking ""The Good Earth"", ""Atlas Shrugged""), I still enjoy it, although maybe in a different way. A classic is a classic no matter where you are in life or how it speaks to you. This book, however, just left me thinking ""What WAS I thinking?"" I can not fathom how it spoke to me or why I liked it. The underlying plot was just a thinly disguised means of rambling about the author's self-important ideas. It didn't take me long to get bored with both the plot and the philosophy. My personal philosophy of quality led me to abandon this book before the end."
3,Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance,"The book is good, however, I would not recommend ever buying any products from the company I purchased this book from- (greatbookdeals)... This is by far the worst place I have ever made a purchase from and I am saying this in a nice way. Greatbookdeals have to have the worst communications and shipping on planet earth.. Please save yourself a headache and buy from anyone else. Greatbookdeals get well I don't have enough thumbs on my hands to give them a thumbs down.Would not recommend greatbookdeals to anyone.............!!!!!!"
3,not what i expected,"decent book but wasent expecting such indepth knowledge and as much time spent on ancient greek philosophy and technology, understanding that is very much relevant to the book it just wasnt what i expected. decent book but very drawn out without much of a reward"
4,Think and think again,"ZATAOMM is a philosophical train of thought to question the meaning behind the meaning. 'Quality' is the term that Robert Pirsig uses to explain the unexplainable. If the previous sentence sounds too philosophical then skip this book. 'Zen and the Art' is a brilliant explanation not only about the source of happiness, but also about the source of the thought where happiness was formed.It gives me encouragement to realise that sitting in a classroom with teachers whose purpose is to indoctrinate not to teach and learn together may not be the ideal growth experience.I completed my reading of the book last night and many of the ideas, morals and guidance are yet to sink in.ZATAOMM is a classic and beautiful narration for the philosophically minded."
5,Speechless,"What can I say one of the smartest things Ive ever done was reading this book,its chock full of insights and philosophy of why late 20th century living is the way it is.I was mesmorized from beginning to end. To those who have already read this book Lila,an inquiry into morals is also a similiar book from this author that is also great."
1,"Self-Absorbed, Self-Pitying Rubbish","I agree with many of the other one-star reviews, this is actually the worst book I have ever read, out of thousands read, in my entire life. The worst book designation goes to Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance because it is extremely, extremely, over-rated. I found it to be one of the most self-absorbed, self-pitying, whining complaints I had ever been exposed to - and I know about those, because I'm a former junior high school teacher.Not only did it not contain any philosophical insights whatsoever, the book is just plain boring and badly written. The only book I have ever thrown in the garbage can - it's just rubbish, and that's where it belongs. I'm sure the author is a fine human being. I just think he wrote a very, very, bad book. Please don't waste your time on this book."
1,The Emperor's New Clothes,"I agree with all the 1 star reviews here, which make for fun and rewarding reading, unlike this over-hyped waste of paper. At 88 pages I cannot and will not read another word. After all these years, and so many people telling me I had to read this, I finally picked it up at a used bargain book store, and I want my dollar back. The author's ramblings on motorcycle maintenance are sleep inducing, unless I suppose you enjoy motorcycles, and all this massive book is, at least from the first 88 pages I have suffered through, is a boring road trip, void of any sign of plot, used as an excuse to paste on philosophical rants, which make me think a root canal is not such a bad thing after all."
2,ADD and the art of motorcycle maintenance,"Ugh. This book can't decide what it wants to be. Every time you get interested in a topic (and this book does contain some interesting topics from the travel narrative to some of the ideas expressed) it switches over to another topic before resolving anything. This is incredibly frustrating from the point of view of entertainment. Does this book want to be a novel and flow like one, or a middle-brow discussion of contemporary worldviews, or a amateur philosophy thesis? It suceeds only in being a very long and slow 400+ pages of several seperate books thrown together with minimal integration."
4,"It helps if you ride a motorcycle, but not required.","I first read this book before I got into motorcycling and didn't fully appreciate the biker situations. Later on in the book it gets silly/confusing with the ghost Phaedrus. Perhaps Pirsig got carried away on the philosophical angle. He should have kept it simpler and more meaningful like Hermann Hesse's ""Siddhartha""."
2,"It took two goes, but i got there",I managed to get the whole way through on my second attempt at this odd book - hard core philosophical discussion mixed in with the narrator recalling his past life as an insane philosophy-seeker mixed with the story of a road trip.The philosophy is so involved that it is esoteric and actually usually boring rather than mind expanding. And there is very little Zen!! It is hard to feel for the central character - he seems so interesting until he starts becoming so invovled in mind numbing minutiae. But there are some great sections on the riding and the 'art' that can be found in 'non-art' activities like motorcycle maintenance.
1,Audiobook Buyers Beware!,"I thoroughly enjoyed reading the book and hearing the Books on Tape version, but the Audio Renaissance 25th Anniversary version is _abridged_, a fact not mentioned anywhere I could find around here."
2,Walden on a motorcycle,"All this book was, was Walden on a Motorcycle. Too Folksy for my taste. It had been on my reading list for years though, so I read it. If its on yours and you read Walden and did not get much out of Walden, you won't get much out of this either. You really have to be in the right frame of mind, IE stoned. Wish I would have read this then like when I was 20. Oh well."
5,Impact,"This book has fundamentally changed the way I think. Since reading it (2001) I have quit my law degree (undergraduate) and re-applied for various philosophy courses, in order to pursue Pirsig's 'metaphysics of Quality'. I'm not suggesting that the book will have the same effect on anyone who reads it, but it will nevertheless challenge your preconceptions and I think that my experience should give rise to at least a little curiosity....."
5,"Wonderful, Deep, and Rewarding","I enjoyed this book in a way far greater than any book I have ever read before. This story makes you think and ponder questions just as the main character is doing. The story is told in the first person and you get a unique view into the mind of a man who is on the razor edge of genius and insanity.I have read this book twice and enjoyed the second read even more than the first. Many insights into the nature of things (don't want to spoil anything for first-time readers).There are many small scenes of perhaps half a page that still stick with me and help me understand the nature of people.I am a better person for having read this and I thank the author for sticking with this book and getting it published where other mere mortals would have given up.The author has his own trials and tribulations and mentions these after the end of the story.I will spend many years, I fear, searching for another book as insightful and enjoyable as this book has been for me."
5,Philosophic talk easy to understand,This book will become one of my favorites very soon. I'm just finishing to read it.It is amazing how easy the writer drives the story and gets in to deep topics and conflicts of our daily life. That makes the book a great source of common sense and wisdom and makes easier to understand the reality.If you are a person interested into find out the source of many problems or conflicts this book can be very helpful.If you would like to expand your criteria for analysing different realities this book can be helpful.It is a bit too long but it is so easy to read... For sure I will read it more than once to find details I couldn't keep before.I'm even using the book for supporting my work like manager. It helps me to make evident some kind of problems and supports very good the process of finding solutions.
2,Just not for me,This is a very detailed book and may be perfect for that person who is into minute details however I was unable to get involved in any way.
2,A good start but the authors beliefs soon ruin the story,"I kind of liked the book and the fresh way it starts.But then the author suddenly goes into complicated explanations about science and beliefs, which could have been interesting, except for the fact that he does not know what science is.He believes science is a search for truth. I guess that this leads to the kind of beliefs that oppose science and religion. And i have no interest in that.That ended the pleasure I had reading the book."
5,STILL THE BEST READING AVAILABLE,"It was a pleasure to reread this wonderful book. It took me back to my youth. I lost it and never got around to replacing it, I am enthralled to have it again in my hands. I highly recomend any of his books and also the site that lets you talk and discuss all of the metaphors in this book. a great read and insight into someones life thoughts. Yours in lit. J.C.M."
3,"Good book, but neither fiction nor philosophy...","I read this book for my English class in high school, and I have to admit, the book was surprisingly engrossing for all its technical difficulties. It was indeed an interesting read. However, as a novel, the book contained too much philosophical lecturing to feel like a novel, but too little real philosophy to feel be enlightening. Some of his adventures (however metaphysical) were interesting, though. The author does present an interesting objection to our common senses. Still, almost all the arguments in this book were from sources that I already knew, and there was no real new insight being revealed. I guess the most accurate way to describe my response would be to just classify as an ocassionally thought-provoking book."
4,Quality Is as Quality Does...,"Being the beneficiary (??) of a Great Books liberal arts education, yes, the same one that Pirsig writes about at his time at U of Chicago, one would think I'd be very dissapointed in his work. Not so. Reading this brings to light many of the questions and concerns I've had over the years. It's a shame I wasn't reading this at the time that I was in college, because I was searching along the same paths he was (although I wasn't involved with bikes at the time, more along the lines of dance parties and the occasional search/rescue mission).For those that are entrenched in the classical science vs art dichotomy, Pirsig will shake you up some. But at the same time, he does bring a big revelation to bear: there is Art within Science, and Science within Art. And when we realize that we can indulge in both, we might be able to get back some of that pride in craftmanship that is so lacking in today's world."
3,So-So,"This book is fairly well-written and somewhat thought-provoking in places. However, it also feels quite dated, self-important, and boring. I was excited to read it, but was ultimately disappointed. It's not that it's bad...it's just not good."
3,"Not terribly great, but thought provoking","ZAMM is a book of intense thought. Some of it is true, some of it is plauseable, but for the most part it just rambles. It somehow makes up for its rambling nature by provoking thought, but in a way it presents a danger that some will take its philosophy as their own. It is not a great philosophy or a great book. It does however open up a train of interesting thought. If you find your thought stagnateing and need a little kick start it is a good read, if you need some life changing answers, guideance or direction, look somewhere else."
4,Pure simplicity,"As another reviewer said, if you read a part of this book and don't get into it, put it down and wait for the right time. This book has so much to offer, but you need to want to listen. This is a book for one who is disillusioned with themselves and everything this ****ed up world appears to offer. It reveals your own inadequacies with such a caring hand because the author knows them in himself. Reading this book, I found someone talking about their own pain. This isn't a book aimed at healing the world. It's a book about stopping and looking at yourself and all the clasifications you make of other people and how quickly we blow off people when we really should be (and in actuality are) blowing ourselves. At the right time it's just a book that makes you realise you're not alone but you are stupid. Who can ask for more than to be reminded of that."
1,shabby,"althought I am enjoying the book, the pages have been cut poorly and unevenly, 5 out of every 20 pages are torn as opposed to cut, giving the book a half assed shabby appearance."
1,Didn't recieve the book,Actually I never received this book. I need to follow up with Amazon to see why. This is a big thumbs down for Amazon.
1,Maintain your sanity by not reading this book,"A philosophy textbook hidden by a disquise of a motorcycle maintenance manual. I know nothing of motorcycle maintenance but I thought that this would be an interesting way to learn a little about it and how that simple act could relate to my life. I was quite wrong. Pirsig does discuss the various fixes he uses on his bike along his journey. Don't get fooled. He uses these side trips only to advance his main topic of philosphic confusion and insanity. If you are a student of philosphy or quality then by all means enjoy, but all others steer clear."
2,...,"I understand that the whole idea of this book is to make the reader think for himself about 'quality', which is a very interesting philisophical concept...this is presumably why Pirsig makes time for the reader to think about it by making 90% of the book as boring as possible. This book falls between reference, fiction and biography and satisfies none of these forms. It's quite amazing how by using the right words Pirsig can make a simple theory seem extremely complicated."
1,He is Insane,"He is insane, and in fact, receives electroshock treatments for his illness. Being forced to receive the treatments renders him powerfully resentful, and his entire book is an attempt to say he wasn't sick. This mess of a book should convince you he was sick."
1,better than sleeping pills!,"My dad encouraged me to read this book, and he had a free copy so I thought what the hell. I had a job at a coffee shop at the time and during down time I would read a few pages. Man, everyone has heard of this book. You don't know how many people came into the store and saw it sitting there and mentioned what a great book it was, I asked everyone of them if they personally read it and I can remember them all saying ""Uh, well I heard it was good from a friend"". Anyway, save your hard earned cash and buy a motorcycle manual or something this is the most boring book I've ever read. There's not a hint of inspired writing or insight here, then again I should have known better my dad reads books on playing chess."
1,Zen and the Art of Crap,Yeah: it all makes sense when you get to the part about the author getting shock treatments.
4,Zen and the art of...,"If your looking for a book that talks about philosophy, this is it, even though it is sometimes incredibly hard to make sense of it. This is truly a book that will force you to think. One must figure out what Pirsig is trying to say through pages upon pages of rambling about the meaning of things such as quality. This is a book to STAY AWAY from if you are looking for a good read.The book starts as a seemingly interesting story about a boy and his father on a motorcycle trip; however, as the book goes on, more and more of Phaedrus, Pirsig's other personality, comes back. The further one reads, the more complex and impossible to understand it becomes. At points, I was just praying for Pirsig to go back to talking about the motorcycle trip, yet as the end neared, I became very interested in what was going to happen, and I must say, I was not let down."
2,Disappointed,"Maybe there has been too much hype about this book, or maybe it's just been out too long and it's all common sense to me by now since these ideas are more in the mainstream than they might have been in 1974. I found the book to be rather trite and condescending, with not much to reveal in they way of new ideas or modes of thought. It was also extremely repetitive and Pirsig takes forever to get simple points across to the reader."
2,What is this book about?,"I read this for a philosophy course--and, yes, I read it all the way through, attended class, participated in discussion. I still couldn't tell you what this book is about. Its subject is surprisingly inscrutable, despite the novel's very readable style."
1,It _Is_ Good! (If You Think So),"(with apologies to Pirandello)Isn't it lucky that Zen patriarchs tend to be an enlightened lot, with an active sense of humour? If they weren't, I have no doubt they would sue Pirsig for libel. What this book contains is all the froth and gibber that you have to dispose of before you can discover Zen.People have a habit of saying that books they like 'changed their life', and this book gets a lot of that. Personally, I find that any book worth reading will change my life. This one didn't.Zen and the Art of Lacklustre Hippiedom has all the philosophical insight of Sophie's World, and all the entertainment value of the Boston Telephone Directory. So yes, I suppose it has some redeeming virtues.In short, a best seller."
5,On Quality:,"The fact that more than 120 people have spent their time sitting at their computers and reviewing the 'good' and 'bad' of Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance not only proves that the book's philosophical meandering about ""Quality"" - which eventually leads to several different points about the essence of experience and life itself is fairly right-on, but that, as in the book itself, Quality is dictated (when intellectually reviewed) by a person's background and preconceptions. This unique viewpoint as well as the grace with which it is reached (motorcycle trips, mountain hikes...et cetera) is enough to make it a worthwhile and brilliant read."
3,like beating your head against a brick wall,"I have never taken a philosophy course, so I will admit that having taken one might have better prepared me for this journey. It starts out very intriguing--both the physical motorcycle journey, and the narrarator's discussion of technology and art. Then, when we get up into ""high country,"" I found myself completely lost. I have a bachelor's degree in English, so I think of myself as fairly intelligent. But perhaps it is like his analogy to reading Walden: you have to pause after every sentence and let it set in. It's just that if I did that, it would take me years to get through this book. Some wonderful ideas, but this book is definitely not light reading."
3,Far from light reading,"This book is far from light reading, and to be honest I'm not entirely sure what my overall impression was. On one hand I thought the incorporation of a Walden-like adventure mixed with philosophical propositions was fascinating and well integrated into the story. On the other hand the material was sometimes too dry and had repetitive, circular logic that seemed to be an exercise in rhetoric. At times I was completely engrossed and jotting down notes for further research, then at other times the writing seemed so trite that I found myself impatiently waiting to finish it. Overall the book is an intelligent work that has personally inspired a pursuit in philosophers such as Hume, Kant, and the Greeks. But an appreciation and prerequisite knowledge of these philosophers would have made the book far more accessible."
4,Pay Attention,"This book taught me to ""pay attention when life goes awry."" In some ways, this is a mysterious book because it is not so much fiction as it is the author's life. Not your average sort of book - it's wise, honest and solid. I also highly recommend ""Open Your Mind, Open Your Life: A Book of Eastern Wisdom"" by Taro Gold. Excellent."
4,Miracle of the Human Spirit,"An incredibly touching search for self, made doubly so by life experiences no one should be forced to endure. The horrors of ECT revealed - a man cleaved in two, one forced to retrace a path from a previous life spent defining quality, hoping to find out who his former self, Phaedrus might have been. The damage done to a sensitive intelligent person - a modern tragedy. One that further compels me to expose the travesty of what passes for ""mental health"" care in a modern age."
3,good story base,"Thought provoking,I understand this book was used in many philosophy classes for many years.It was fun to listen to durring my commute to work.Being a motorcycle rider, I found it eseptionaly easy to relate to.Everytime I was getting lost in the mediphisics, the author would get back to the original story to bring back my intrest.Very well written.Ernie K. Rivewrside, ca."
5,Classic of softcore philosophy.,"While ""Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance"" has been criticized as mushy philosophy, it is still a great read, and it justly deserves its ongoing cult following. In the 21st century, we've grown accustomed to trash goods and services: corrupt corporations and politicians; shoddy consumer goods; diminishing or disappearing service. ""Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance"" still provides at least a psychological antidote -- viz, a benchmark for quality."
1,A Disgruntled Philosophy Student,"As required reading for our philosophy class our teacher assigned us Zen... However, he failed to tell us how boring and unelightening the book actually was. Pirsig is not really a philosopher, but more of a rambler who just goes on and on about quality...whatever he means by that. The chautaquas were dry and the narratives only slightly better. I don't recommend this book at all."
2,OVERRATED,"I don't really care for chatty writers, and Pirsig likes to palaver on like it's nobody's business. Just get to the point and back it up with facts. The first time I read Zen was when I was teaching college at the time it was published. There was a lot of buzz going around about the book. Some profs were assigning Zen to their students, while almost everyone was praising it as the book of the century. So I had to read it. It didn't live up to the hype. There's nothing really deep or novel here unless you're a fan of syncretism, in this case the meshing of Eastern thought with Western thought. It's my view that both are mutually exclusive, and that any attempt to combine them dilutes both of them. But I'm biased. I'll take the Greeks, Augustine, Aquinas and the rest of the Western tradition any day."
2,Disappointing,"There are some good reviews already about why this is a bad book, I'll add my vote to that column. It being such a best selling book and supposedly about zen (see title, Zen and the Art...) I came into the book excited. It started out interesting but became tedious.He goes on and on about motercycle maintenence as if his goal was to bore the reader (which he succeeds quite admirably at). The way he talks also grows old fast, very self concious which he might be doing to show he has psychological problems, but it doesn't work. It reminds me of the way a high schooler would talk who is perhaps a little clever, but certainly not up to the task of writing a book. It's a little like the book ""A Work of Hearbreaking Genius"" which sucked even more than this book.There are some interesting thoughts in the book but it's overwhelmed by the trash. If a friend of mine enjoyed this book I'd lose respect for him."
1,Junk from start to halfway through,"This book is utter junk it is not even written properly the grammar is appalling and a simple sentence is made into a major trial to read. No wonder so many publishers rejected this book it is so poorly written. It is only utter junk half way through because no matter how I tried I could not read more than half the book.Even the story is all over the show,that is when I have deciphered WHAT the author is trying to write down.The standard of English display is that of an 8yr old. Not worth a penny.Fit for the rubbish bin only.Total and utter crap."
5,What Philosophy is All About,"Suppose that I were to try to describe this book to someone who was a philosophy professor, an expert in some German philosophers, a critic of Nietzsche who considered Nietzsche's psychology as prominently as his philosophy in matters of religion; there was no way that I could say anything better than in the words of this book itself. I had been reading a lot of philosophy the way my father had before he became a minister, like it is taught in college. Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance was the perfect focus for the complaint that any philosophy can only be a way of trying to graduate carbon copies of someone. The real person comes through at the end, where I like to start things rolling with the sentence, ""It's so hot . . ."""
3,Mixed Feelings About This One...,"Mr. Pirsig has written a very thought-provoking book and I am glad his stand on quality and values (or the lack thereof in this society) was put into print. As I continued to read, however (and I did read the whole thing, by the way), his character became more and more scary. I don't think I would like to meet him because the picture in my mind was of Reverend Jim (from the old tv series ""Taxi"") but only more bizarre and without a sense of humor. The book became increasingly ponderous and incoherent, sort of like the main character. I would recommend reading it, however, because it does contain some good ideas plus you will know what people are talking about when they refer to this book."
2,"Intellectuals love it, the rest of us just struggle.","Every 'professional' review of this book that I have read has been incredibly favorable. Just see the synopses given here. But for myself, I found this book very hard to read, very pretentious (""I opened up the throttle and Pheadrus said 'What is truth?'"") and really, really boring. I find that books in which the author revels in his intellectual superiority to me leave me cold. Of course, there are lots of people who profess to liking this book because it it seems to coat them with a veneer of intellectuality. My mother calls that 'putting on airs'. And of course as we all know, a veneer is only on the surface."
1,WAY Overrated,"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance is the rambling thoughts a philosopher who concludes that because he can't define quality, it can't be defined and is the center of all insight about the universe. (Quality Control professionals would have no problem providing such a definition.) Philosophers often come up with goofy conclusions about other people disciplines such as the nature of God or the universe and yet so often people look at these musing as profound. This book is neither profound or entertaining.The author takes what might have been an interesting story about a motorcycle trip or about the importance of understanding and maintaining your own equipment, and ruins it with these musings."
2,oddball book,"""Zen and the Art.."" is certainly a different kind of book. Personally, I couldn't get thru the entire novel. At pg 248, I just gave up. Phaedrus' rants about ""Quality"" are just horrible. It does give some good insights, no doubt about that; however, the author seems to take odd paths and use the novel with some propaganda means as well. (for ex. Sylvia and John need technology but can't work with it/understand it). This novel is different from others I have read, but a good read if you're up to the challenge. I would say give it a try up to 150 pgs. if you don't like it after that, then quit because you're not going to like the rest of the novel at all."
3,Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance,I have only gotten thru half of the book---perhaps I should hold off my rating till I finish it and then rate it.
2,Possibly the worst literary experience of my life,"This work claimed to be a 'chautauqua'. By definition, it cannot be. There is no discussion in a book. The book is strained, trite and convoluted at best. While it raises some issues, I felt that no issue was truly addressed."
1,Like A Golf Ball Through A Garden Hose,"The only reason I gave it one star was that they didn't offer a zero-option. When I first read _ZaMM_ I was crushed that such a good title had been wasted. It contains neither Zen nor motorcycle maintenance. The title was designed to sell in surburbia. And for some unknown, ""emporer's new clothes"" sort of reason, it does.The book drones on with successive street corner rants better contained in a tome entitled _Sometimes I Feel Like a Nut, Sometimes I Don't_. I know Quality (one rant which dragged on for what seemed like nearly a thousand pages) when I read it... and this ain't it. At the time I read it, I *had* Zen and the art of motorcycle maintenance going with my motorcycle. ""<Profanity>,"" I thought, ""I can write a better book on the subject than that."" (And there are many folks who think I did.)"
2,I Don't Get It,"I'm sorry, I just don't get it. I think this book is over rated. Maybe if I read the whole thing it would have changed the way I think and feel about my life, but after forcing myself through of the book I said ""that's all I can stands I can't stands no more."" This book isn't about Zen or motorcycle maintenance, it's about a guy on a motorcycle trip with his son trying to find the truth about his life. Just too much philosophizing for me."
3,fair vs good vs poor condition,"The book was described as in 'good' condition but I found it to be in fair/poor condition.. very tattered, however, readable. the owners were very nice to deal with when I told them my query and even offered to refund the cost. That was not necessary and the book is being read, just would have appreciated a more accurate description. there was no image to go by either."
2,An Intellectual stroll through a swampy morass,"I found this book to be quite tiresome and ineffectual. Despite all the hype leaped upon it, and having read numerous reviews, I failed to see the relevence between Zen and the shock treatment given to the main character. I simply got halfway through the book and had to move on to something more interesting. nuff said."
1,What was that all about???,"I read this for my book club - and if it weren't for this I would have given up after struggling through the first 100 pages. Some people seem to really like this book. I just didn't get it. The meaning of ""quality""? Enough already!! I feel like I just read a book about the meaning of ""the"". I'm the dummy though, for not following my instincts and putting it down after the first 100 pages. Hey - for those of you that really liked this book - I know of a bridge here in Brooklyn for sale...."
1,Most Overrated Book I've Ever Encountered,"Don't believe the hype. The whole premise that ""Quality"" is an undefineable thing is ridiculous, and the whole rest of the book is built on that flawed premise. A huge disappointment after hearing so many wonderful things about the book."
2,Reread it as a parent,"I don't get it. All of this praise for a book with a misogynistic, selfish a-hole for a main character? A road trip with your child is something to be savored between the two; yet I remember reading only two or three conversations between them. Granted, it's difficult to talk while riding a motorcycle, but you have to get off of it sometimes.And one of the few conversations is when Chris is told people are saying that he has mental/emotional problems. When you think of everything the poor kid had to go through with that nutcase of a father, I don't think Chris is the one with the problems.The book is not about philosophy; it's the rantings of a schizzo whose parenting skills make Joan Crawford look like June Cleaver."
2,Not What You May Be Expecting,"You would think a book about motorcycle maintenance and zen would be a very down to earth kind of read but a huge majority of the book is spent on philosophic meanderings and metaphysical mysticism. As many people have said the ideas in this book aren't exactly new these days but that's not the author's fault since he wrote it over 30 years ago. The problem is that he's taken very simple concepts and made them ridiculously complex.In contrast to this book, pick up something by the Dalai Lama about buddhism. I find it very ironic that while the spiritual leader of Tibet can explain a concept so simply, some guy on a motorcycle wants to tell me about how a dead greek guy's ideas relate to an undefined term called 'quality' that comes before everything else.It's just disappointing to me because I was hoping to hear a lot more about motorcycles and how they relate to life and zen but he completely forgets about the bike about a third of the way into the book."
1,Boring..,"I bought this book because it was required by my English lit teacher!! Required reading!! Anyways, I didn't enjoy this book at all. Not my type, definitely.But if you are interested in reading this book, just remember, this is one book that you can judge by its cover. It's about exactly what the title indicates. Kind of a novel/bio about a man who gets into motorcycles and becomes philosophical about them. A little bit creepy, not too interesting and even some steamy scenes.Weird...and not worth my time."
1,A waste of time.,"A good friend raved to me about the book. I read it. Sorry everyone, but I don't think the king has any clothes on.-BB"
1,ZEN and the art of boredom...,"This was by far the most boring book I have ever suffered through. Yes. I read it all. From all the hype on it, I knew it must get better. NOT...Don't waste your time on this book, unless...you really like to read someones philosophy on every thing except a mototcycle road trip."
1,Where is the Quality ???,"I finished the entire book to know the complete nightmare that the author put his son through. I read it recently with a author's postscript. He is just a creep and kind of scary and his ""philosophy"" is completely illogical. I just about cried for his poor son."
5,The Whole Approach Changes . . .,"I decided to re-read this book now that I am older, have my own bike, know a little bit more about Buddhism, and (showing my non-Buddhist material side) wanted to convert a ragged paperback to a hardback for my permanent library. It was certainly better than the first time around, but my favorite quote is still right at the front of the book, ""We want to make good time, but for us now this measured with emphasis on 'good' rather than 'time' and when you make a shift in emphasis the whole approach changes."" This is a book I can hopefully read many more times in my lifetime and an easy five star. This version was the 25th anniversary edition and has a new introduction from Pirsig."
4,Inner Analysis of the Highest Order,"A thought provoking book which causes you to think about yourself and life. Best to be read in thirty page intervals for maximum comprehension and understanding. Some may have trouble understanding Pirsig's thoughts, writing and ideas. Once you get into the inner thoughts of Pirsig, you begin to understand his views of society. A lot of work went into this work. Well written and thought out. The most intelligently written book I have ever read. Constant analysis and thinking required. Not for everyone. A book one can go back to again and again. A book unlike any other"
4,Whoa.,"Deep. Deeper than I had originally guessed or planned. I feel accomplished to have read such a text, and thankful to the author for sharing it with me."
4,Life-view changing book,"Everyone should read this book, it will expand your ideas about life. Really gives an insight into how to be innovative."
4,A Zen Philosophy,"Probably written for a specific reader, one who likes to think on a different plane, outside the box. A challenging philosphical view of life."
5,Take the time to make this journey,"In this world of reality TV, instant gratification, and moving through life at a blinding pace, Zen is a welcome journey. Read this book, and take your time pondering each message. You will be better for it."
3,Bought this for my mom,"I like the song selection and the quality of sound, should have bought one for myself. The Chi-lites sound as fresh as they did back in the 70's."
1,"Their ""FIRST MISTAKE""....","The first mistake on this CD (or any Chi-Lites compilation/greatest hits) was NOT to include ""My First Mistake"" from their 1977 release ""The Fantastic Chi-Lites"" produced by Ritchie Rome! This is a quintessential disco/dance song that has sent crowds into frenzy @ clubs around the world....especially in Chicago. It is inconceivable to me for there to be a release of ""greatest hits"" & not have this spectacular song embraced."
3,"Excellent, though dated, summary of effective communication.",Confronting can be difficult and awkward. Augsburger uses practical tips to understand how confronting can be the most caring approach. Also offers details on how to communicate more effectively -- and expect others to do so with us.
3,books,"college course required readings or textbooks, served their purpose, good shape and arrived on time for classes, easy way to get cheaper books"
5,ONE source of spritual essence,"This book is a treasure with full of knowledge based on Vedas, Upanishads and other great spiritual scriptures. The process and purpose of the meditation are superbly explained. This is a great source to learn the spritual essence and to find answers for numerous questions."
2,Didn't agree with me,"DLPA is an Amino Acid supplement for adults which is supposed to elevate your mood, decrease your pain and help with alleviating symptoms of arthritis, depression, menstrual cramps and migraines.I have taken it several times and believe it has the potential to do what it claims. Unfortunately it upset my stomach and so I was unable to give it more than a brief trial run."
4,Completes the collection for sure,If you're a Stooge fan and acquired all 9 volumes of the Stooges on DVD then here you go with the rest of the best from the vaults to bring it home. Thanks Sony. The boys deserved the best and you delivered the best.
5,Sultan's Seal,"It took a little bit longer to receive the item than I had hoped for, but it was exactly as described. It arrived in perfect condition. I would definitely order from them again."
1,Strange present tense,"I'm not sure why I bought this. I guess it sounded interesting. Which, I think it might be, if I could get past the author's use of present tense and third-person narrator. I simply could not get past page three because I was so distracted by this awkward combination. I don't mind present tense in an autobiographical or nonfiction book. But here, it just seemed like an awkward stylistic decision that didn't work."
4,a fictional primer to Turkish elites,"This novel has its flavor of a good thriller but it offers more about the mentalities of late Ottoman Istanbulites. To make it more specific, although it provides a rich scene of everyday lives, it focuses on the elite lives of Istanbul. It is not partisan at all, it demonstrates the complex nature of relations and signs of the emerging leaders of the new Republic."
4,Elegant mystery of the Ottoman Empire,"The Sultan's Seal by Jenny White is a fabulous first novel. Kamil Pasha, a magistrate in the Ottoman Empire of 1886, is assigned to investigate the death of a young English governess. Instead he finds layers of betrayal and lies, as well as the affections of the ambassador's daughter. White writes a powerful mystery by carefully weaving together the stories of Kamil, Sybil, and Jaanan. Most mystery stories are solved by the laying of a foundation, almost like masonry work, but this story is told colorful thread by thread until the pattern is almost complete. The clash between the dying Ottoman Empire and the young men within it, as well as the political influence of the English is used to great effect. White also uses the cultural mores of the day to advance the story. An elegant mystery."
2,"Good recording, Horrible packaging","I would have been very happy with my purchase of this set, except for the packaging. The boxes for 3 of the 5 CDs came broken. That in itself was a sign of what to expect for the treatment these CDs must have gotten. When I opened the first box, I noticed that the CD had fingerprints on it right out of the box. I thought it might not have mattered, but on the last song of the CD, my player goes nuts skipping all over the last recording. I tried to clean the prints, but they won't come off, and I think that using anything short of some really caustic chemicals which would damage the rest of the CD will not take these prints off of it. If you want good quality music on a quality product, spend more money on another set. I never expected this poor quality handling from Amazon."
3,"Good orchestration, great price, one CD skips...","Dad and I are novices to classical music, but this set sounds great to us! I tend to go for quality over quantity, but the Hungarian Philharmonic gives me no reason to buy a more expensive set of Beethoven's works, especially when there are so many more composers' sets to buy. I also like having all nine symphonys in one compact set. My one gripe about this set is that one of the five CDs has a flaw in the surface, which causes my player to repeat over and over... Maybe a more expensive set (with implied higher quality CD stamping?) would have been the way to go; it's a hassle returning items when they don't work. Hence, 3 stars rather than 4."
1,TERRIBLE!!!,This is an abosolute DISGRACE TO BEETHOVEN'S MUSIC!!! The music is Far below the tempos that Beethoven originally wrote. The quality of the recording equipment is also quite terrible. I was extremely displeased with these pieces. I now have learned a valuable lesson.. NEVER PURCHASE INEXPENSIVE RECORDINGS! They tend to be of poor quality.
5,An excellent introduction to beethoven's symphonies.,"The sound is excellent, and the musicianship and conducting is excellent."
2,too small,"This item didn't hit the mark. It is so small I had to spend time trying to get it in the right place to protect myself and it was never handy nearby to do that. Maybe a handle loop would help. But I am not interested.I still have them, but don't use them much."
3,"Handy and Convenient tool - Not Bad, Not Great","The ""Swiss Tech UKTBS Utili-Key 6-in-1"" attaches easily to your key ring and is completely unobtrusive, being the same shape and size of a normal key. The multi-tool can be a little hard to open at first, but becomes easier with usage.While it says 6-in-1 (Flat Screwdriver, Micro Eyeglass Screwdriver, Bottle Opener, Phillips Screwdriver, and Knife), I find that the Phillips Screwdriver and Knife are the most practical and get the most use.The tool is reasonably well made and sturdy, but should not be used as a pry bar or other high stress uses.A handy and convenient tool, recommended if like having basic tools with you at all times."
4,Nice rack bag with cooler for 4X4 QUAD.,I was pleased with rack bag when I received it. The price was very good and the quality was also good.
5,Awesome!,"This is a great product! And if you've checked the official Honda or other ATV makers they want twice as much money. It has a ton of room in it, stays on nice and securely. We pack the cooler and it stays in place and keeps the drinks nice and cold. Highly recommend!!"
2,Not designed for intended purpose,"At first sight, this is a great looking bag for your ATV, and it contains convenient storage. Do not attempt to put any ice in the cooler, otherwise it will melt and leak everywhere, it will not stay contained. My biggest complaint about this product is the quality of the tei down straps -- Every one of mine ripped in less than a 6 month period -- Or in about 3 to 4 3hour rides. For the price, it should have sustained the basic riding elements instead of falling apart. I have since thrown this in the trash. Unless there has been a change in stiching quality -- Beware!"
2,Do you like to sew?,"I purchased this product last year and after no more than four or five rides the mounting straps came apart. The stitching came undone on the straps that attach into the bag. The rides I have been on were nice, easy going flat trails so there was very little stress on the straps. The bad part is it came apart right after the one-year warranty expired so Quad Gear will not help and I know how little stress this bag was under. I would not recommend buying it unless you like to sew."
1,JUNK,"Went to Coal Creek riding my ATV, bought this bag because of the cooler that was attached. Halfway through the trails the straps that hold the bag to the rack started ripping off. By the end of the day every stap was broken. I had to use 2 ratchet straps to hold it on. Do not by this bag. Sent this bag back and got money refunded."
4,Curt Class I receiver,"This is the second Class I receiver I have mounted on one of my vehicles. This one was the easiest of the two. You do have to fish a bolt and washer through a frame member to get the bolt to protrude through a hole, but it wasn't as hard as it seemed it would be.The only real trick is tightening the two horizontal bolts. You need a really long ratchet extension to reach these nuts."
2,"Great writing, not-so-great characters","[***** = breathtaking, **** = excellent, *** = good, ** = flawed, * = bad]The writing is gorgeous, which is a given for McKillip. But all three characters are exactly alike -- and, while two are women, the third is supposed to be a guy!Plus, the actual quest got a little murky for me. I was never sure exactly how our main characters are supposed to save Ombria. Longer review at ImpatientReader-dot-com."
3,The Shadows Stay Shadowed,"I loved this book for its poetic language, its characters and its atmosphere. I was surprised, however, that the ending revealed so little. There seemed to be such original ideas brewing beneath the surface of the politics and intrigue. Unless I missed something, it never explained what the Shadow city was, what its relationship to Ombria was, what the shift was, why it happened, or who the sorceresses were. I picked up some implications that Mag may have been half of the shadow city, but it never said, and it didn't say whether she was related to Ducon in some way. I suppose the characters' lives were fixed in the end, but I was still confused. I wanted a more in-depth revelation of the nature of this world."
5,poetic romp,"Ombria in Shadow is a great book. Patricia McKillip's true conquest is one of language. It took me two chapters to really find a groove with the reading, but once I did, the book wasn't long enough. I kept wanting the chapters to be longer, I kept wanting to spend more time with the characters. For me, that's a mark of great writing.For anyone who reads fantasy, here's a chance for something different. For anyone who pointedly doesn't read fantasy, here's a chance for something different. I would definitely say that this is a reader's book."
4,"Good, readable fantasy","A good chef can make wonderful pastries from ordinary ingredients. That's how McKillip writes: she starts with the evil queen, a half-hidden mage, a city on the edge of shadow, and the eventual defeat of evil. There's a princeling, not yet of age, around whom the intrigues and fights for dominance center. McKillip turns these basics into a very readable, enjoyable fantasy.There's enough left unsaid at every step to hold a reader's attention: what is that other city, the one without daylight? Who, or what is that artist? Why does each thing he draws take on extra meaning? I won't spoil the story by saying too much - there are many other questions to be answered before the book is over.This book is clearly aimed at readers with more interest in the people involved, and less interest in weapons and combat. It's fast-paced, but gentle and a bit romantic. The right reader will get a lot of pleasure from it."
3,"Good, But An Awful Ending","I really enjoyed this book, it kept me interested. But I don't understand the ending."
2,An Alright Book,The racial conflicts had a lot of realism to it. I feel the racial relationships had been discussed nicely. it held a feeling of early racism. It was clear that the book had clarity of racism in the 60's.
4,"A lesson in history, and in our neighbors","I read this for a college class comparing books and movies made from those books. This was a wonderful place to begin learning about my fellow students. Younger people did not understand the book, or the movie. As a snapshot from the past, it acted as a place to begin building awareness of how much progress has occurred since the Civil Rights Movement, both in individual understanding and societal acceptance. Those of us who do remember those old days, were able to provide some validation for the story. And it IS a wonderful story, told with simple strength."
4,A Blue patch Review from Mike,"A Patch of Blue Review:Reviewer: A reader from SouthBend, Indiana. I thoght the book was great because it shows a love to races. It proves the world is not in darkness after all. All people can get along if they chose to. The book has a good meaning and it has a realistic outlook to it. It would seem to give people a certain feeling of goodness that they would carry with them wherever they go. It shows that racism is a bad thing which is good to know. When I read the book I actually felt a new life spark into me and I feel like I changed somehow. I look at life differently now. And like they say, life is not fair but in the end it can turn out to be."
4,A Patch of Blue,"A Patch of Blue is an outstanding book! It is set in the 1960's when race and prejudice was a problem. A blind girl named Selina gains and loses many things throughout her life. She falls in love with a man without knowing his race. Being blind still makes it hard for her not to be prejudiced against others, as that's all she knows due to her childhood. Her love for Gordon teaches Selina not to be prejudiced, and she finally realizes people are people no matter what their race. Although the book does not have a typical ending, it has a profound effect. A Patch of Blue is a very enjoyable and memorable book. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys love stories, as well as learning about life."
2,"""A Patch of Blue"" is an OK book but the ending is bad!","After reading A Patch of Blue I could tell that Elizabeth Kata must be a good author. I must admit though, by looking at the cover and reading the summary on the back of the book it didn't strike me as being an interesting novel. It really isn't as bad as it looks! In my opinion, Kata does a good job using the interesting liability of a blind girl to tell a love story. If you like stories of love that knew no color, then I recommend this book to you. For her first novel I would have to say Elizabeth Kata did fairly well. The beginning of the book grabbed my attention, the middle lost my interest slightly, and the end was confusing and depressing. But don't take my word for it! Go read it for yourself and see what you think!"
5,"Compeling, one of a kind!","Once I started A PATCH OF BLUE, I could not put it down. It left me breathless- I was like,""WOW!"" A very moving and touching story- the book is a diamond in the rough. I usually go for fantasy but this story dealt with human emotions, racial prejudices, and tolerance. It was kind of confusing but I think it was done with a purpose. The message that this story sends to you is clear and strong. I couldn't help but feel moved after I read the book. It'll be one of my all-time favorite book."
4,BEWARE! Unfinished business,"This is an exhaustive bio . . . but the author, James Mellow died before finishing the book. I read it with great interest, but because of this unfortunate occurance, the book is unfinished. So, if you're looking for a birth to death bio of one of my photo hero's, I suggest you go some where else."
5,Wonderful Book!,This is one of the best written books on the wonderful Walker Evans. It is well worth any price to own a copy of this book to remember one of the greatest American photographers ever!
1,Looks can be deceiving,"These thongs looked like they would be comfortable. Unfortunately, they are very heavy and feel hard on my feet. They drag on the floor as I walk because of their weight/design. Yuck!"
5,Does the job,"Good athletic tape. Tears well but is strong. Can be used to tape ankles, fingers, whatever. Does the job well."
4,Easy,The easiest tape will allow you to tear it with your fingers. This is the tape for that. It's strong and works well so leave the scissors home.
1,Tripped-up,Buy some other product. The suppressor did not protect any of my equipment after a lighting hit a tree in my back yard and sent a surge thur the satlite dish into the house.
4,Great reading while I was backpacking in the Sierras,I read most of this book on my kindle during overnight camping for a week backpacking on the Pacific Crest Trail. It was great to see John Muir's attention to detail to things that I was experiencing and his observations that are still valid close to a century later. I was not disappointed. It is a good read.
2,Well intentioned but...,"The Sierras are much nicer when visited in person. Reading about the natural wonders found there isn't the same as actually checking them out for yourself. Perhaps if you were already familiar with the areas Mr. Muir traversed, and wish to brush up un them or revisit them literarily when unable to do so physically... THEN perhaps this book would be better."
5,John Muir's first summer,"If we all loved God's country the way that John Muir did, it would be awesome. His descriptive latents are wonderful. Great reading!"
3,A really long book about the beauty of the Sierras,John Muir does nature only as he can. This book is great if you want to know every beautiful detail about the Sierras in the early 19th Century. Muir is so passionate about nature that he often gets mad at nature destroying other nature.
2,"If this is classic nature lit, then maybe its just me...","I am going to resign from critiquing this book on a literary scale, and just say that I didn't enjoy this book for the same reason a couple others mentioned - its boring and repetitive. Maybe its because I'm not used to aimless - albeit eloquent -landscape descriptions, or maybe it's the fact that NOTHING happens for 264 pages, but reading this book felt more like a chore than an enjoyable reading experience. Case in point: Casual readers beware!"
2,Cowboy turned Witch,"As a Halloween costume, this hat looks more like a witch's hat than a cowboy hat. It was difficult to keep the hat from flopping over. We ended up going with a real cowboy hat instead."
3,2-inch-wide mouth? Depends how you measure it.,I purchased this funnel to use with come containers which have a 2-1/8 inch opening. This funnel will NOT fit because while its throat (inside diameter) is only 2 inches the outside diameter of the neck is a full 2-3/16 inches. It is not that it is thick-walled; it's not. But it does have a peculiar crimp or curve at the very bottom opening of the throat which creates an _inside_ lip which suddenly reduces the diameter of the throat for the last 0.007-inch. (A lip which needs a little extra cleaning attention after each use.)
5,Steeltek Stainless-Steel Canning Funnel,Very nice functional item. Handle is a plus. Much better than like items made of plastics.
5,Great Size,A wide funnel teamed with a large ladle makes breezing through large quantities of canning tomatoes much less stressful.
3,Too much jazz filler.,"I thought this series (both Vol. 1 and 2) were a good source of historic blues info. I especially like the way they corelate historic events such as the 1929 Market Crash and WWII with blues events and artists. The only criticism I have is that it mixes too much jazz with the blues. I know there's a bluesy side of jazz (Billie Holiday, Dinah Washington, et. al.) but that's space in the video that could have been dedicated to blues people: more down home delta guys, Chicago 50 & 60s, Texas, New Orleans, West Coast, British, you name it, but no jazz filler, please!"
4,destiny,"Riding Freedom is a great book about a girl who knew her own mind and had to make choices early in life to fulfill her dreams. She is a strong, determined character that engages the reader. Her few important friendships are well-drawn. The book did end with a complete story arc, but abruptly, and the reader was left wanting to know more."
3,Riding Freedom,"Riding FreedomThe book Riding Freedom is about an orphan who has run away from an orphanage. She finds a horse driver. The really exciting events in the book were when she escapes, becomes a horse driver, and when she falls in love with one of the horses.This book would appeal to horse lovers. Annie has a love for Freedom, the horse at the orphanage. She was even cared for by horses when her parents died in an accident. When Annie was a baby, her parents and her went on a horse ride. They went down a hill and they were trying to stop but they couldn't. They crashed in to another horse carriage. Her parents died and she lived.This book is a page turner. If you like excitement, then you should read this book. This book would also appeal to people who like to read about people in different situations."
5,emotional,Charley/Charlotte is a very brave and daring person. When I read the novel Riding Freedom it moved me a lot. I couldn't put the book down until I finished Riding Freedom. I even wanted to look and see if there was a sequal to this intresting book! I hope people enjoy it as much as I did!
2,"Very boring plot, terribly written","This is a pretty poor horse book. If you want a super-good horse book, read the Heartland series. I could'nt believe it when I saw all the other reviews saying this book was great.Choose another horse book. In the beggining, Freedom dies. In my opinion, that is dead pathetic. The title is RIDING FREEDOM, people, and if Freedom is going to die in the beggining, that's just junk."
1,not vary good,this is im sory to say not easy to read i did not like it much i do not think it was put together very good tryed to read it twice and just could not i don't recomond it i am giveing it a quator of a star
4,Adventure plus horses!,This marvelous book was assigned reading for my son when he was in 3rd or 4th grade. I had trouble wresting it away from him. Fast moving adventure story with lots of horse-action.For more books like this see my listmania list: 'For horse-crazy kids'http://www.amazon.com/gp/richpub/listmania/fullview/R3NE2PRUVU56TN/ref=tag_tdp_lgcn_elst
5,RIDE AWAY WITH THIS BOOK.,RIDEING FREEDOM is a really good book. I liked it because there are horses in it. The girl named Charlotte runs away from the orphanage. She hops in a stage coach and gets off at a barn and she sleeps at the barn. She works for a man named Ebenezer. Then she gets kicked in the eye by a horse. Then she isn't sure about driving stagecoaches. She tries and tries again. Finally she gets it. I liked this book because it has a journey when she runs away from the orphanage. This book was awesome! Read it!
5,Riding Freedom,"This book has two main characters that are named Charlotte and Hay. This book is a very good book to me and hopefully to you. To me, this book is good because I love horses and this book had very good details and description.Charlotte and Hay always were good friends at the orphanage and still are. Charlotte and Hay always wanted to own a ranch in California together, but it never happened. What did happen was that Charlotte by herself owned a ranch in California. Charlotte bought one horse and a little later in the year Charlotte's horse had two babies. Charlotee named one of the babies Thunder and the other baby Freedom.I hope you get a chance to read this book."
5,Science fiction at its best,I believe that S is for Space is THE best book I have ever read. There are several short stories that are entertaining and easy to understand. Bradbury once again captures the human essence in a series of stories. This is a great book for beginners or even advanced readers.
2,WATERY,"I TRIED TO SPRAY THIS WAX ON MY BOAT AFTER CLEANING, IT WAS PRETTY WATERY & DID NOT SEEM TO DO MUCH"
1,Messed Up My Computer ! !,"After first loading and playing this awhile, the images got all fuzzy.This problem was then passed on to anything my child tried to do on her computer - all games, even the opening screen.The problem did not go away until I uninstalled Rolie.My daughter loves the show but found the play value very disappointing.The computer has a 333MHz Pentium, Windows 98 Plus, 128Mb ram, 1Gb available on hard drive, and an 8Mb graphics accelerator card - so well exceeds the system requirements called for by this game."
1,disappointed!,"We waited for months for this to be released and we were thrilled that it finally shipped. Unfortunately, we had problems with it from the start. The installation crashed my machine. Then, once it installed, running the game crashed my machine. It works intermittently, but it does work, so decided to keep it. My daughter is 2, and is definitely young for the game, but I don't think it will keep her attention even when she's older. It's extremely slow and clunky too. Overall, I'm just really unhappy with the whole thing. The only thing going for it is that it's Olie! And, of course, the characters in the show are cute."
1,Next time will pay a little more,"I bought this for my 4-year-old. I had one like it as a kid and remember it as being mind-blowingly awesome. This one is not. It doesn't focus very well, there's no definition or crispness to what you see, which diminishes the educational value greatly, in my opinion. I won't send it back, because it was so cheap that postage will be half the price anyway, and at least I can console myself in knowing that when my kid loses interest in 3 minutes I didn't go under for this. Given that my kid is 4, this is no big loss... When he breaks it I will congratulate myself on the money I saved! But the next go round I will definitely go with a more expensive product in hopes that it will be the awesome toy I remember."
1,"Feels cheap, doesn't focus","I purchased several $6 and less ""field microscopes"" off of amazon to test them against one another. My goal is to find one or two models that are suitable for a homeschool co-op class of 6-10-year-olds. This one failed right out of the box. It was the most expensive model, with the lowest magnification, a useless focus knob, a cheap build quality, and no batteries to power the light. I requested a refund 10 minutes after opening the package so hopefully the seller will oblige."
4,Fun toy,"This toy can be addictive! You'll find yourself hunting for things to look at when you take it out of the box. Comes with a lightweight case, which is nice for storage, and definitely easy to use. At first, we found everything to be a bit blurry, but then - oops - found the focus knob! That definitely helped a lot, LOL. Don't expect the quality of a science lab microscope, but for general household objects (i.e. salt, skin, hair, tabletops, etc.) it's great. A nice change of pace from video games and television for the kids. Uses 2 AA batteries (not AAA as stated in one other review). This would make a great gift for any child over age 5 or 6, so you may want to get several to keep on hand for those birthday parties that pop up!"
2,Junk,"Don't waste your money. While works slightly, it's really just a gum-ball machine quality plastic toy. Do better spending some more on a real quality item."
1,Broken if you put in the batteries,"The device looks fine, but fragile.. when I put in the batteries the comparment will not even close. I had one of these as a child and my son wanted one. I KNOW it was better back then as I used it for years. This didnt last the day. The batteries compartment split open as soon as the first battery was put in."
2,For the price....,"It magnifies, it lights. For the price, it works. My complaint is that the LED is too bright. It makes it difficult to see/focus on anything because of the bright white glare that reflects off of anything and everything you try to focus on."
3,You get what you pay for,Its a cheap and easy way to see if your trics are ready. It works and shipped faster then estimated.
2,Didnt expect to much...,For the price. Optics are cheap but look at what it costs. The controll are skittish not very smooth or respond well.
3,decent deal,For being so cheap its a great deal actually the only issues I have is that the light is too blue and the focus wheel doesn't stay where you put it. You have to hold the focus wheel in place in order to not lose focus. Perhaps mine was just a little defective but I only paid a total of like $6.
5,wonderful educational toy,this is a great learning toy for all ages. Just looking at hair strands is an experience your child or anyone will learn from. Definitely recommend to those who want to learn with their children or themselves. Have fun with it! :)
4,Disappointing Quality,"I ordered 30 microscopes. Six of the microscopes did not work - the probems ranged from shattered bulbs, to bulbs that did not work, to several microscopes that wouldn't work after trouble shooting by trying a new bulb, new batteries, etc. That boils down to only 24 working microscopes out of the 30 microscopes that were ordered."
2,Courteous reseller,"I purchased these pocket microscopes to give to my grandchildren. I found them wanting in optical quality. Specifically, the 'scope suffers from soft focus and chromatic aberration. Perhaps it would be useful if you knew exactly what you were looking for and just wanted to verify the presence or absence of a given microscopic substance, property, or flaw. Not good enough for general exploratory or educational use. The narrow field of view alone would make it challenging for a child to understand what they were looking at.That said, the seller provided the utmost service in fully addressing my dissatisfaction. I will gladly purchase from this seller again. I will, however, try to make a better guess at what performance can be anticipated from a very low cost item."
3,"Fantastic toy, short life.",My 7 year old had a lot of fun with this toy. For a day. Then the lightbulb burnt out and it was done. I'm now shopping for a higher quality pocket microscope.
2,Pretty boring,"I have to agree with the previous reviewer. This book was quite boring and there was no real action until the end...and even that wasn't great.If this is the first time you've read anything by Marion Zimmer Bradley, don't let it keep you from reading her other books--Mists of Avalon was one of the best books I ever read."
1,"The More I Read, The Less I Wanted To...","On Beltane Eve 1969, Truth Jourdemayne became an orphan when her mother died and her father disappeared while performing a magickal ritual. It is now 25 years later, and as Samhain Eve approaches, Truth finds herself in her father's Hudson Valley mansion, where a group of initiates are trying to re-create that same failed rite. Stranger and stranger things begin to happen around the house, is it haunted or is it caused by the macigkal dabbling of the inhabitants?Black magic, haunted mansion, sounds interesting, right? Wrong.I feel awful saying this because I love Bradley's Darkover novels, but I couldn't even finish this horrible book. It was BORING, ssllooooowwww, and the character development virtually nonexistent."
3,three hundred pages of filler,"Whelp, it seems that MZB will be wallowing in the reputation of Mists of Avalon for the rest of her career. I must confess that I stayed up until 6 am to finish reading this book - and I was greatly disappointed. This is standard MZB self discovery crap, with a few standard fantasy elements thrown in for good measure. Vague Arthurian mentions, Aes Sidhe connections and lost magic all mixed together with pseudo parapsychology and ghost appearances to hook the reader. If you enjoy cheap horror novels, this book might be a bit of a lark"
4,Interesting,"I liked all of marion Zimmer Bradley's *.* -light novels a great deal. They provided a neat melding of contemporary interesting people with witchcraft and the occult, with a satisfying amount of plot twists, dramatic details, and a happy ending. Overall a great read. Rather paltry after the mists of avalon, but, heck, anything looks paltry after it."
3,"Well, it was.....interesting.","Yes, it was interesting. The subject matter is exceptionally unique. I've never read about anything like this before. The characters have groovy names - Truth, Light, Julian....etc. However, its not something I would read again and its not something I would reccommend. If you've read Zimmer Bradley's Mists of Avalon, you'll find this book extremely poor in comparison. However, once you get over expecting it to be as phenomenal as Mists..., its an enjoyable story. There are a few too many characters for my taste, and they aren't very developed. Don't buy it; get it from the library"
4,Magick and mystery - a contemporary fantasy.,"I would have liked this book a lot better if I hadn't read ""Mists of Avalon"" first. It's good, but not *as* good, if you get my meaning.The story is engaging, the characters well drawn, but there's something missing. A familiarity with the occult is recommended, but notabsolutely necessary."
1,Bad romance novel,"This book is awful and should be avoided at all costs. The plot is thin and has huge holes in it, I skimmed the last hundred pages just to get through it. Nothing annoys me more than when a female writer gives her female characters every negative female stereotype there is. Truth is supposed to be highly educated and working in the paranormal field but knows ABSOLUTELY NOTHING about it...she misses such obvious things that it is amazing she can tie her own shoelaces without help.If this is a real exampe of occultists in the modern day they deserve all the bad press they get as none of these people has any intelligence of their own and blindly follow whatever ""cult"" leader is convenient."
3,Maybe 3 1/2 stars...,This book reminded me of when you are watching a movie and you constantly yell out
1,This film makes me hate being Canadian!,"Why do Canadian films always suck? Why does the world love Atom Egoyan? Yeah, machines can both aid and interfere with human communication and intimacy. We all know that modern modes of communication can ""erase"" history and lead to a narcissistic culture, but these ain't great topics for a feature film. Gee-whiz! I'll take an Ed Wood film about go-go dancing zombies before I sit through another Atom Egoyan flick!!!"
5,A nice quick reference,"This is a good, concise herbal book containing history, folklore, recipes & cooking tips, and more. There is also a decent appendix at the back, listing herbs and their corresponding planets, spirits/deities, magical correspondence (or use), and element. You might be able to find some of the information in this book in others, but it can fill out your library nicely, and contains information not regularly found."
5,Foood,Every time we get to discover a part of the word by its food and culture its wonderfulthank you for doing such a great job.... this is something you have to get if youare a food lover and enjoy traveling
4,Tony is the man!,"Watching Tony is great. His quirky narratives, and exploration of exotic locales and cuisines are interesting and entertaining."
5,Does the Job Well,"This is a small spatula, but I find myself using it for almost every cooking task. It has no seams or open spaces to catch sauces or food, so it's very easy to clean, and, because of the stainless steel core, the blade has a great stiffness to it that makes it easy to scrape the insides of bowls, pots and food processors. It also is very resistant to staining from sauces."
4,Almost Complete,"I would have given this CD 5 stars if were not missing his rendition of ""Danny Boy"" which shows his vocal range and control like no other."
3,It would have been 5 stars if my order wasn't broken,I read the reviews for other soup crocks and they all had bad ratings due to the crocks being broken. This item had a really good rating so I thought they must pack these really well so they don't brake. I was totally wrong in thinking that. Two out of four of the crocks were broken. There was no extra protection in the box to keep these from braking. They packed these like they were shoes. Just a box and some scraps of paper. If they had used a little bubble wrap they probably would have made it to my house in perfect condition. Now I'm not saying you shouldn't buy this item just don't buy them if you want four crocks that aren't broken.
5,Exact info we needed from previous review,"Because you had a review from someone who had bought the same frozen onion soup from COSTCO that we had, all of our questions were answered ie. crock capacity and oven temp., it was perfect. Thanks"
3,color not accurate to what is shown online,I like these bowls but specifically purchased them for the gold or mustard color which is shown. They came in a very boring brown color. Disappointed but will keep them because they appear to be sturdy.
4,Perfect for our uses,"We had bought frozen French Onion Soup at Costco, not realizing we needed crocks to cook it. These crocks work great for the purpose - however they don't bubble over the top, instead the soup is about an inch below the top. That's fine, just not the exact presentation you'd get making it from scratch.We also figure we can use these for dips when we have parties.The color is more brown than yellow. It's kind of a darker mustard brown."
2,Cute but not that useful,The product arrived damaged but was promptly replaced by the seller. The dish itself is not that great as it has a rim which makes getting the spoon out a hassle when u are eating soup. I would not have bought it if I had seen it in the stores.
1,"broken...AND made in China, lead concerns",Two of the four pieces were broken. I would have ordered a replacement for the broken two until I realized they were made in China. Way too many lead issues with things made in China. Will not order ANYTHING made in China again.
3,Pot Holder? No!,"Bought this thinking ""what a clever item"" --cute shape plus could be used three ways. Trivet - yes! Jar opener - works well! Pot holder - NO! Product snaps back to flat shape unless gripped extremely firmly. Ended up dropping glass lid onto floor, narrowly missing my sandled foot."
1,hi,This is one of the crappiest written book I have read. I fell asleep every time I read it. I tried my best. This does not usually happen to me
4,Shouldn't MARY TAMM be on the DVD Cover instead of Lalla Ward?,The Key to Time comes to its amazing conclusion! Also--just wondering--WHY isn't Mary Tamm featured on either the Front or the Back cover (which she WAS on the previous DVD release of this story)? Lalla Ward is a guest star in this story--she isn't playing Romana (yet!).
2,Beethoven Symphony 5 1st movement,"I downloaded the first movement. The clip was good because of the quality sound. I am dissatisfied with the splicing that was done on the recording. When it repeats, there is an obvious cut. When it transitions to the development section (after the repeat) the horn is off in pitch (an obvious splice as well). Entrances are not always solid in the strings and there are a few intonation errors in the winds. I also feel there were some balance issues (sometimes winds are not heard). I am also disappointed that I don't even know which orchestra this is-- not on the CD cover or identified in the MP3 list. I will be more cautious next time."
4,A stellar score for a ground-breaking show,"When Battlestar Galactica re-appeared it was clear that we were dealing with something that would challenge our expectations of a sci-fi drama, and it did so with such critical success that it made fans of people from widely varied and unlikely walks of life.A great deal of the success of the tone of this show is attributible to Richard Gibbs' score, which is as unconventional as the show itself. Stark Koto drum arrangements underscore battle scenes to add to tension, and the times of desperate peril are sometimes voiced by simple sad bell arrangements which run counterpoint to the direness of the situations. The music is truly another main character to provide reference to the action, and always in an unconventional way.Pick this up to relive the spectacle of the show, or to give similar mood to your day in the world which our heroes on Galactica are so valiantly trying to find."
3,Nice soundtrack,This is a nice soundtrack. I think it's more reserved because this series has lots of dialouge so it does have delicate sounding tracks then explodes during battle scenes but still a small set of instruments and synthisizers I believe but still makes it work very well for the series. It's very enjoyable to listen to it.
4,For a small-time composer...,"...this is an amazing score. The direction taken was a refreshing change from the usual bombastic orchestral or, god forbid, the synth that we are so used to in productions of this genre. I was very pleased with the end result. The tribal drum rolls, light synth, and passionate vocals really made this score stand out from everything I've heard in recent years. Though some may find the styles of several tracks to be repetitious, I can be very sure that the soundtrack deserves at least an honorable mention. Though Bear McCreary should also be credited for several tracks. Many of the better ones too. Look forward to the release of the first season's soundtack."
2,Disappointing...,"Listened to the samples, read the reviews & opted to get this Season 2 soundtrack as opposed to #3 or 4 & I'm not sure what to make of it. It just goes on forever, is just a mix of several 2 min sounds thrown together to make a cd or ""season"". I personally didn't find anything remotely musical about this cd & listened to it twice. Maybe after it sits a while & time passes, I'll give it another try. From all the youtube vids etc I auditioned before purchasing this cd, sorely disappointed."
1,"Best TV Series Ever, Worst Sound Track","Um, this is pretty much noise. The season one soundtrack has several good tracks that I could add to playlists and listen to often. This one, not so much."
4,Emotion Evoking,"Although this is just the mini-series, a lot of the elements established in this soundtrack permiate the regular seasons. Also, the calm yet erie emotion that is evoked is very powerful and adds to the dynamic power of the disaster that has befallen humanity to the scope that Battlestar tries to reach. Watching the miniseries again after having listened to the soundtrack makes it that much more poignant. Scenes are that much more powerful, and that's without the standard hollywood blood and explosion (such as when the ships without FTL drives are abandoned to save the rest of the survivors... it's the music that really dramatizes their fate.) Some tracks may seem a bit repetative, but you can't have the full battlestar experience without this soundtrack."
3,"Interesting story, but hard to follow","Like most of Kienzle's books, this one has an interesting twist to it, but the plot becomes hard to follow due to the ""alternative plots"" contained within."
4,Nice trailer.,"I turned mine into a boat trailer. It is pretty flimsy unless one puts a floor on it. After scratching it up I found the color is Rustoleum Red. The boxes it came in we're falling apart and one was open but all the parts were there. It's too bad you can't get the accessories this side of the pacific though. No problem with inspection and title. I deducted a star because it is out of square. Only one corner can be at 90 at a time no matter how tight or loose the bolts are. Since It won't get a whole lot of use, I don't mind too much."
5,The best of Fresnillo' talent is demonstrated in this CD..,For romantic songs none other than Javier Torres and his group. Each song is well written and the message is positive. Listening to them in person is a greater experience.
1,Not what I expected,"Anyone considering buying this CD should know that it's not live. The ""rants"" consist of Dennis reading transcripts of routines that I presume he previously performed live. Misses the whole point of listening to Dennis Miller."
4,One of Ms. Baird's best,"This was the first book I had read by Jacqueline Baird, and I have to say it was an absolute pleasure. I have to disagree with the other reviewer, I didn't find anything melodramatic about the couple's past.Nick is an Alpha male who gets what he wants. He wants his son and his exwife Abby back, and will stop at nothing to get them back.This book is a wonderful way to spend a lazy Sunday!"
4,"ok, with one problem","Actually, I liked this book except for the treatment of the secretary. If not the heroine of a book, secretaries are always painted to be after the boss. No exception here. I wished the secretary's lies (when Nick gave her the gold bracelet) to Abby in the ladies' restroom would've came out. The woman should've been fired, not promoted to a job in NY."
4,A delightful evening with Mozart.,"There are many performances of the Serenata Notturna, but this one by Berlin Chamber Orchestra has qualities of refinement and alertness,that make it rather special.This very familiar music comes up fresh as anyone could wish for. The Divertimento K131,written when Mozart was 16 , but sounding more mature, is composed for flute ,oboe,bassoon,4 hornes and strings. Here the Salzburg Camerata Academica players are of the highest caliber both technically and artistically. The Divertimento K205 cast on a large scale, and dimanding of virtuoso playing provides a difficult but well resolved task of balance. Vegh directs another characterful,delightful performance,to round off a very desirable disc."
5,"The Best ""Reduced"" History of Germany Ever!","To provide such an insightful history of such a complicated country as Germany in a mere 460 pages is some feat. I've read many German histories, but this was the one that left me feeling as if I understood the German soul. Especially valuable is Barraclough's illumination of Rome's, and a series of Popes', retrograde influence on Germany's early development. If you can only read one German history, this should be it."
1,Not for me,"I couldn't get into this book. I tried more than once to read it. It seemed to wordy, overly descriptive for me."
1,Not what I expected,"Based on the title I thought I'd love this book but I've had great difficulty ""getting into"" it and still haven't read it all the way through. If feels as if I'm ""plodding"" through it which isn't fun."
2,"great subject, poorly handled","it's more about the writer's experience with Jimmy than about Jimmy himself, though it does shed some light on Jimmy's colorful personality."
1,True Adventures with the King of Bluegrass: Jimmy Martin,The book was informative but a bit disappointing in that it did not cover Mr. Martin's early life. It is a shame that a man with such potential ended up as an alcoholic.
3,Eh...,"Although I enjoyed the book a bit, I must say I was sorely disappointed. I wounldn't say the book gave off incestous vibes as one reviewer so queerly pointed out. The only problem I had with the novel was Madison Leonine. As other reviewers stated...she is 'way' too over the top. Half the time I was hoping for someone to take A cheap shot at her and knock her one her rear. All the times she did wind up on it was her own doing. But alas, it is not my imagination and I have no right to devle into Elizabeth's at all.On the up side....I enjoyed the characters names :D."
2,Meh.,"I felt compelled to review this myself after buying the book based on the reviews posted here. Almost all of them were glowing, save one, which is the one I should have paid attention to. The fact that this writer was compared to Tolkien is a crock, thank you very much. In her(and any other fantasy writer's)dreams. Let the buyer beware.Although this was not a terrible book, it didn't stand out enough for me to consider it a ""good"" book, either. I found it to be derivative of Anne Rice, Harry Potter (without the whimsy) and any given Anita Blake novel. Elizabeth Ashe hasn't done anything new with her story: the main character, Madison Leonine, is an annoyingly archetypal heroine; beautiful, smart, sassy, perfetcly perfect, but with a dark secret. What a shocker."
5,An amazing story!,I am a huge fan of Liz Ashe and I have been waiting for In Shadowside to finally be published. This book is definitely worth the wait. Liz Ashe has created an amazing supernatural world where the reader gets drawn into the story and the lives of the characters. This is a great book. Go and get four or five copies. You won't be disappointed!
4,Liz is in true form,"I've loved Liz's writing for the longest time and this is on a par all its own. I can't wait for new stuff. Its nice to read something so original and creative. I say that if your waffling on buying this then stop, it well worth the money and then some."
5,An excellent look into spiritual warfare,"Folks, this is the real deal. This book pulls no punches. It makes no excuses, nor does it hide behind any false ideologies. All I can say is to be spiritually prepared, receptive, and open while reading this book because it will make you examine your outlook on modern-day Christianity unlike any other ""end times"" book out there. It's an excellent read with a stunning message of hope for the true believers in Christ."
5,LAMB - Just can't put it down!,"LAMB is a compelling book about the raw human spirit. It reflects how man can really screw things up if his way is not the Lord Jesus Christ's way!LAMB's characters come to life. It's 3-D without the pictures! There is a character with which every reader can relate. The inner dialog of the character's shows the silent workings and struggles of the human spirit. The struggle of good and evil.BEWARE, even though LAMB is fictional it exposes a lot of truth: How evil looks good and how those ""good looks"" deceive many.In the end, it leaves the reader glad to know that God's grace is perfect and in His love we have Hope.LAMB's a must read! Just can't put it down!"
2,Can We Say Ridiculous?,"I gave this book two stars just for some writing style and building some suspense. The author does an okay job with that. But if you know anything about the Bible, I would suggest you read something else that sticks closer to the Bible. If you want science fiction, Lamb is the book for you."
5,An Amazing Page-Turner,"When I first started reading this book, I just couldn't put it down. One of the things which really impressed me about this book was Zeph's amazing writing style and prose: Everything flowed from scene to scene in a beautiful fashion. Why this book never made it to a top-10 list is beyond me?? Perhaps, it's too controversial, poignantly honest and hot for most people to handle, accept and deal with?? This book will show you how the Spirit of Jesus works through people via the Holy Ghost and Holy Spirit. If you ever wondered what spiritual warfare is all about, then this book is for you.. If you ever wondered and pondered about supernatural protection from/by the Lord, then this book is for you too..."
5,Transformation-life in its rawest & lowest to its highest!,Multi-characters keep the reader reeling in intense turn the page to see whats next in this true to life story. An awesome read not for the 'fair-u-see and sad-u-see' thats for sure!Well done and a hardy applause to author Zeph Daniels.
5,Ron Bohmer paints a picture with his voice!!!!,"Having had the pleasure of being around Mr. Bohmer during his tour as Joe in Sunset Blvd., I've been waiting for this CD for almost 2 years. It was well worth the wait. I'd forgotten what a fabulous voice this man has. Besides the title cut, you can tell from ""Sunset Blvd"" that this man was created to play the role of Joe Gillis. His duet with Linda Balgord, who he not only was paired with in the tour of Sunset Blvd., but also in Aspects of Love, which this duet is from, is amazing. I can only hope that the two of them will record a CD of Duets for everyone, who has not had the pleasure of hearing them sing together in person, can enjoy. His original songs like, When The Lights Go Out, shows you that he truly feels every word that he wrote. I was so fortunate to get to hear Mr. Bohmer everynight for nearly three months during the St. Louis run of SUNSET. Now I can listen to him daily once again. What a truly amazing voice and from a truly amazing man!"
3,"Great voice, but there's just something not right.","I liked this album, but it isn't one I'd listen to very often. If you like Webber's music, you'll probably appreciate the album, he really does most songs justice, especially ""Love Changes Everything"" even Michael Ball cannot hold a candle to the velvet softness that Bohmer gives it. I have NEVER heard his match on that song. However, his ""Gethsemane"" was screechy (fairly unpleasant), especially in comparison to Michael Crawford's far more elegant version. On the whole, it is worth owning, especially if you like theatrical music, just keep the remote near you."
4,Sleek watch..but the color?,"I have been replacing watches that I lost in 2007 and this KC grabbed my attention. It is a sleek and modern looking watch, I like its square look and the way the watchseems to flow into the watch band. So far it is keeping good time. It feels well built, but not to heavy. Its a watch that you can wear for any occasion. The only reason I give it 4 not 5 is the color, and this may be my computers fault, on my screen the watch has a slight green tint (that I like) but the watch in fact is just shiny stainless steel, but still a very nice looking watch, one I will wear often."
4,Great watch!,We purchased this watch for all of our groomsmen at our wedding. They loved it so much that my husband bought one too!
4,"Am I free of the Mara, Doctor?","The evil Mara from the previous season returns to haunt Tegan's dreams and then take control of her once again. This time, it manipulates her into steering the TARDIS to a world where it was banished centuries ago. Now, on the anniversary, the Mara plans to gain control of the world once again. A very good sequel to one of the best stories in Davison's time, Kinda."
3,"""Where is the Great Crystal?!?""","Not exactly a sequel, but a decent follow-up to ""Kinda"", has the Doctor trying to stop the return of the Mara through Tegan. Janet Fielding makes a great vilianess. The design is wonderful. Davison is a tour de force trying to convince people of worldwide destruction. Love the archealogical spin on this story. And Lon is a great character. Another of one of the charming 5th Doctor Stories."
2,The Mara Returns...,"Just like the first Mara story, ""Kinda"", this has a very good plot in it. Unfortunately, like ""Kinda"", the story suffers badly from lack of action. Apart from the cliffhanger, part one wasn't that good at all, and part four has a confusing and mediocre ending. Apart from the regulars, the acting was terrible. And the costumes were hideous looking like the ones in ""The Horns of Nimon"". On the plus side, like ""Kinda"", the plot was excellent. There were some eerie and scary parts in this one, all the cliffhangers were great, and Janet Fielding's acting was breath-taking. She does a very good job playing the part of a possessed Tegan. She made my hair stand up. But in all, I would not recommend this one."
5,The Mara's Back!,"A great story. Just like ""Kinda"" it's kind of confusing and what's happening may not get a full explanation, but I think that's what attracts me. You can fill in the gaps with your own imagination or research."
4,More than just an anthology of poetry,"This collection brings to us more than just a gift of poetry from the land of Israel. It allows us to touch lives that we have no other conception of. In Voices, we meet people who live in fear, in awe, in tradition and history that we here in the US have almost no connection to, and we are privileged to take a glimpse into their lives and passions. This publisher had a keen and creative eye in bringing us a gift of modern history, beauty, and of course, the graces of the poetic verse that we otherwise would not have heard."
3,Okay,"This book was actually really good, but I just had a hard time imagining the settings, the kind of clothing she wears, etc. Plus I thought it was quite hard to read. I just about mmbled over the names. Plus, if you noticed, on the top of the book it says ""Special Edition"". Whats so special about it? It looks pretty much the same as the othe ones. Hard back, gold lined pages, pretty illustration on the cover.Nothing new."
1,Not worth it,"Usually I go straight to the bookstore and buy a new DA/MNIA/RD book when it comes out. I'm glad I saw this one at the library first and got it there. After about 80 pages I had to quit. The plot was very weak and dragged on. Usually by that point in the books, something interesting has happened. Not so in ""Lady"". If you feel you have to read it, try to get it from a library or a friend first to decide whether or not it's worth it to buy it. Lawrence Yep wrote fabulously in the My Name is America journal of Wong Ming-Chung. Sadly, he seems to lost some of his touch in ""Lady""."
1,One big disappointment.,"""Lady of Ch'iao Kuo: Warrior of the South, Southern China, A.D. 531"" was rather long and boring - it dragged. Perhaps if the length of the book had been shorter, it wouldn't have seemed dull. Yep seemed more interested in war strategies then the life of Princess Red Bird. I was disappointed he did not give more detail of her schooling and life at her palace. Another major disappointment was finding out nearly all the characters in this novel were fictional. This statement should have been brought up in the beginning before one begins to read, rather than after the book is finished. The final disappointed was in the epilogue - it was very un-detailed. I do not recommend."
4,"Above Average, But Nothing Extraordinary","This book is very good, but nothing that really stands out. You can identify with the main character, Princess Redbird, who feels out of place in both of her worlds: her home in Kingfisher Hill among the Hsien, and her school in a Chinese settlement. In spite of this, I found it hard to connect with the other characters in the story. They were all quite vague with a few exceptions. I would recommend it if you see it at a library, but you might want to think twice before purchasing it in hardback."
1,The Worst of the Royal Diaries,"I hate to be negative, but this book is just plain boring. It was far too long with too much pointless yakking and not enough suspense. The characters' names and names of places started to sound the same after a while, and the writing was unclear in a few passages. People who are interested in Asian history would love it, but in my opinion, it was extremely dull."
1,Lady of Ch'iao Kuo book review,We had to read this book for class and I thought it was one of the worst books I ever read! I do not recommend it for you to read. It is very boring!
4,Lady of Ch'aio book review-by brooke b.,"Lady of Ch'aio Warrior of the South, by Laurence Yep, is an amazing story that will take you through the diary of a Hisen princess. This story takes place in Southern China, A.D. 531, in the Great Forest. Some main charictars are Princess Redbird, the owner of the diary, her older brother, Little Tiger, Mother, Father, and her teacher, Master Chen.Princess Redbird is sent to Master Chen, an elderly scholar, to learn how to read and write. While she is there, another tribe called the Dog Heads start a war. With all this fighting and killing, she doesn't know what to do. The reader will love this book because it really shows happy emotions and sad emotions throughout the pages of this diary. You will really get a feeling of what it was like in Ancient China."
4,"A Good, Tragic Book","This book tells the story of Princess Redbird, a young girl who lives in Southern China, but is not Chinese. She is educated in China, but only to help her parents with the Chinese who want to attack. When her father is at war, his body is brought back, and her troublesome brother is named king. Her brother makes a stupid mistake in war, so Princess Redbird must happen with a trap that just might scare the enemy away... But maybe not."
5,Redbird ponders the questions we ask today about war,"Mr. Yep could not have known what was in store for America September 11, 2001, but I bet Princess Redbird (Lady of Chiao-Kuo) would believe it, expect it, and have words of wisdom to pass on to us today. This fictionalized account of a great female warrior, diplomat, and peace maker of ancient China has issues relevant to today's reader. She wondered how things got so bad, why did this happen to her people, and how would they survive. I recommend this book as a class reader and a way to sort through our own problems with the wisdom of the past."
4,Great Historical Story,This is a great historical story. I lived in Panama for a couple of years so it means a bit more for this reason I suppose
3,Well written but more history than engineering,"Definitely an extremely well-researched and well-written tome but about three-quarters of the book is about the politics and planning prior to the actual building of the canal. If that's what you are looking for, I'm sure you will enjoy it. I was hoping for more discussion of the creation of the canal community and the engineering of the canal and locks. A lot of reading to get to that portion of the book. Additionally, I think the book would have been served better with more maps and diagrams of the canal.Also, keep in mind that the book was written in the mid(?)-70's so the history from the past thirty years is not included. A minor point, I know, but perhaps worth mentioning."
5,A Most Profound WorK!!,"I found Mr. McCullough's book about the building of the Panama Canal to be well written, extra-well researched, and highly entertaining! I would recommend this book to anyone who truly wants to know what it took to build such an engineering marvel. Having lived in Panama twice and visited on many occasions, I can attest to the fact Mr. McCullough's book is THE SOURCE for accurate information on the canal and it's builders (both French and American efforts). I would also recommend purchasing the NOVA video, which Mr. McCullough narrates, called ""A Man, A Plan, A Canal, Panama"". He even quotes out of his own book on screen! I've never read a book so intricately and fastidiously researched. MUST READING for the true Canal enthusiast."
5,Nobody Beats McCullough,"I cannot say enough good things about David McCullough. ""The Path Between The Seas"" is my third McCullough book (""Mornings on Horseback"" and ""Truman"") and is a masterpiece. ""The Great Bridge"" is next on my list."
5,The Classic History of how The Panama Canal Came Into Being.,"I first read a borrowed copy of this this book some fifteen years ago and bought a copy for myself (since re-read, at least in part, several times)some six years ago when based for a time in Panama City, having then embarked on writing my own first book, a thriller titled ""The Panama Affair"".As a valuable research tool, a damn good read, and a fascinating history of how this project to breech the tropical disease infested jungle, and cut a hole through a small mountain range with early twentieth century technology came into being - along with a new nation; and the politcal machinations and deviousness that lay behind its creation, McCullouch's masterpiece has no equal."
5,A well done story of a great American accomplishment,"Having lived in Panama, along the Canal, and having read this book both before and while living down there I can say that the author did a splendid job. Most Americans today only vaguely realize that we ""dug a canal"" in Panama years ago. The full story is fascinating history. McCullough weaves a detailed yet very readable story of political will, international intrigue, national pride, and engineering excellence to show that the creation of the canal was one of the crowning American achievements of the 20th century - the ""moon shot"" of it's day! Wonderful!"
5,Panama Canal Review,"David McCullough has one of the best minds today. His writing style is very easy to read and has a cadence that is natural, full of facts and makes you a part of history.I was so impressed (I have about 8 of his books) I sent a letter to him via the publisher thanking him for being who he is.He is a very gracious man and actually sent me a reply.Anything you read or see with his narration is a class act."
5,"The Path Between the Seas: The Creation of the Panama Canal, 1870-1914","Having spent the first twelve years of my life (1933-1945) in the Canal Zone, and with a father that began working for the Panama Railroad Company when he was only nineteen, I have always had an interest in the history of that great achievement. Thus, I have read many books on the subject. This was by far the most in depth, detailed and INTERESTING of them all. The author tied all the various entities involved into one fascinating story, although historical, that seemed like a developing dramatic story. If someone wants to learn about this ""wonder of the world"" achievement and do so in an enjoyable manner, this book is for you."
3,WELL DOCUMENTED BUT A FEW OVERSIGHTS,"In the avalanche of information found in this book, we have found a few oversights:- The 1892-1898 period is skipped, as well as the trial of the contractors working for the Lesseps Company, most important to determine the origin of the fortune of the Bunau-Varilla brothers,- It is not correct to affirm that Philippe Bunau-Varilla had been involved in investing in his brother's newspaper, Le Matin; Maurice was the sole owner.- It is also incorrect to state that Bunau-Varilla's fortune came ""out of a private source that remains something of a mystery."" No more! A new book by Gabriel LOIZILLON shows clearly the origin of his fortune.David McCullough is nevertheless right when he writes: ""It is fair to say that without Bunau-Varilla there would be no Canal at Panama"".Let him be thanked for recognizing the merits of this great man."
3,Different point of view,"The book quality was described as ""good"" . I have had multiple pages fall out of the book. If that is what they call ""good"" - I couldn't agree."
2,Boring,"Very factual but exteeeeeeeeemly boring and wordy. I read it before going through the cannal and it helped me greatly to enjoy the trip, but it could be 1/4 the size and still do the job."
4,"The Path Between the Seas: The Creation of the Panama Canal, 1870-1914",Excellent reading for anyone interested on how/why/poltical intrigue and the problems involved with the building of the Panama Canal.
4,A man a plan a canal panama,"Just remember ""A man a plan a canal Panama"" reads front to back and back to frontGreat book by a great author."
5,Great book; terrible edition,"This is a great book, but the Kindle edition was terrible: footnotes in the actual text without any notice; unneeded capitalizations in the text, words ""disjointed"", etc. Now I notice that there is no longer a Kindle edition. I wonder why?The Path Between the Seas: The Creation of the Panama Canal, 1870-1914"
5,Impressive!,"It takes a good author to make a subject like this interesting. McCullough accomplished it!The story behind the Canal is so much more than just the physical construction involved. The years of the French construction involved a lot of corruption and scandal that I'd never heard about!Then, after about two decades, American takes over, and within a few years the canal is open for traffic. The successful fight against the deadly mosquito was one of the turing points.McCullough talks a lot about some of the politics involved, in both the French and the American stages. The story behind the Panamanian revolution was quite interesting. . . the US more or less ""stole"" Panama from Columbia, I guess you could say.Definitely a good book, and worth your time to read."
5,First-rate!,"Who would expect a book about a feat of civil engineering to be fascinating? Not me, for sure, until someone recommended Path Between the Seas. David McCullough weaves together anecdote and personality, finance and failure, statistics and statecraft to produce a book that makes us marvel at something we've taken for granted: the Panama Canal."
4,A Thorough History,"This book is a very thorough history of the French and US efforts to construct the canal. I had no idea of the extent of the French efforts, nor of the extensive efforts made by the French to promote financing of the project. The sanitation and logistical infrastructure that ultimately had to be put in place for the US effort to succed was mind-boggling. Overall, I enjoyed the book, however the level of detail was at times a bit much."
4,Another hit by McCullough,"You'll know everything you ever wanted to know about the creation of the Panama Canal--and more--by the time you're done here. This book is massive! But, in typical McCullough style, the prose is long on both detail and interest. Only a few places tempt one to 'skip' ahead, but by and large, it'll keep you hooked. A truly AMAZING subject--one we all can benefit by knowing more about."
3,McCullough's done better...,Only 1/2 way thru but not impressed yet... McCullough is usually much better with documentation and narrative but so far this one's not grabbing me. What took up the first 25 % could have been covered in 5-10 pages. Getting better now but still no like others by this author in terms of quality.
5,A great book about an ambitious project,The Panama canal was an essential part of American empire and I expected to hear about that as I read this book. While the focus on empire was not found here a tale of disease and hardship was. The sheer mechanics of building this project were amazing and this is a must read for all technological historians. McCullough weaves a complex tale with ease and the reader cannot wait to find out what happens on the next page. The construction and political decisions will make the reader cringe at times but the eventual triumph will bring a smile to any reader. This is one of the great McCullough books that is often left out but deserves great acclaim. I encourage all to read!
3,KINDLE Beware,"Well written and thoroughly researched, this is a typical McCullough fascinating and informative narrative. Why the 3 stars: because the KINDLE edition is not complete. No maps, which although noted in the Table of Contents are unavailable - without a link to the text or an appendix because they are nowhere in the e-book. This is particularly aggregious because the possible geographic locations for the canal are described in great detail in chapter one (and to some extent two), leaving one with no picture of the reality of obstacles they created; very confusing. I stopped reading, will try to return the (as usual poorly formatted) Kindle version and will definitely buy the (less expensive) paperback edition."
4,Cruising the Canal? MUST read.,VERY detailed but extraordinary details to ensure you understand what it really took to build the Panama Canal. History buffs will all love it.Anyone planning a cruise through the Canal should read it for sure.
5,A superb rendering of the whole story behind the Panama Canal,"Most Americans are largely unaware of the whole story behind the building of the Panama Canal. With discussions of a new, wider canal through Nicaragua once again underway, it's an excellent time to pick up McCullough's excellent history. It's fascinating reading, excellently rendered, and one wonders if the French would have succeeded had they not been so stubborn about building the canal at sea level. Probably not; time allowed the Americans to bring improved technology to the effort, and the private financing the French used also had crippling implications. McCullough catches the fine details as well as the coarse, the people as well as the process, and the time spent here is both educational and enjoyable.Another winner by McCullough - highest recommendation."
5,Path Between The Seas - A Journey Worth Taking,"The Panama Canal is probably one of the most overlooked achievements of the last century. David McCullough who you may know as the host of the series ""The American Experience"" tells us of the toils and troubles of the men who built this masterpiece of Engineering. McCullough's style is entertaining and imformative and makes one wish that he would write a book on everything. This book will make you see things in a brand new way. Also check out ""Truman"" by McCullough as it is equally intriguing and informative."
5,Interesting story!,"It takes a good author to make a subject like this interesting. McCullough accomplished it!The story behind the Canal is so much more than just the physical construction involved. The years of the French construction involved a lot of corruption and scandal that I'd never heard about!Then, after about two decades, American takes over, and within a few years the canal is open for traffic. The successful fight against the deadly mosquito was one of the turing points.McCullough talks a lot about some of the politics involved, in both the French and the American stages. The story behind the Panamanian revolution was quite interesting. . . the US more or less ""stole"" Panama from Columbia, I guess you could say.Definitely a good book, and worth your time to read."
5,The Path Between the Seas,"Excellent book. I read it in preparation for a cruise to the Panama Canal. When touring the area our guide said that this book was their ""bible"" . The depth of the research is remarkable."
3,the book was boring,way too much detail on the actual engineering mechanics of building the canal and too little on the lives of the workers and Panamanians involved.
5,Wonderful Insight into an Amazing Feat,"This is another outstanding work by David McCullough. His excellent research and easy to understand narrative put you right there in the canal with first the French and later the Americans. McCullough takes you through the political and enginering twists and turns that made the Panama Canal possible. You'll travel to Paris, Washington, Bogota and Panama to meet the people involved and take part in their conversations and planning. This is a must reading for anyone interested in construction and history."
5,Incredible story,"When I picked up this book from a stack of my wife's I was interested in neither the setting nor the subject. But from the first chapter, I was unable to put it down. Well researched and written, it told a fascinating story."
3,Ponderous Undertaking,"McCullough stuffs a lot of stuff in his books. This is no exception. I am still reading it. Could be my ADD. But, the story is remarkable and McCullough does a very good job at detailing all the horrific-ness of this nearly God foresaken undertaking from both the politics as well as personal side of the equation."
5,Page-turning non-fiction that reads like a novel.,"This the best book I've read in a year. It's 600 pages that is hard to put down. Truth is more interesting than fiction. It's a marvelously well written and human story of a historic epic. Highly recommended for anyone interested in history, engineering or Panama."
4,Path Between The Seas by David McCullough--brief review,"Great, very long, book with much (sometimes too much) detail. It divides into 3 parts. Part 1 is all about background and the progress of the French in trying to build the Panamá Canal. That occured before 1900. Part 2 is all about the background and process the United States went through in making its decision to build the canal in Panama (and not in Nicaragua). Part 3 is about the actual building of the canal from the early 1900s until its completion in 1914. I'm so glad I'd read this book before going through the canal recently. Some friends of mine bogged down in Part 1 and didn't get into the rest; so one might consider starting with Parts 2 and 3 (although having the background of Part 1 certainly enriches the total experience)."
5,very nice chenille,I ordered a twin for my daughters bed and a queen for my bed and it is just lovely. Wash it first but you will have chenille everywhere but then it stops and is very fluffy. If you would like it to touch the floor then order one size bigger than you mattress. Fast delivery and a great company to work with.
3,Tree stars,"This effort, at least to me, is the REAL Whitesnake sound. Most kids who cut their teeth on the early 1990s band only remember the incredible guitarists the band hired and the crappy songs they wrote. But this...THIS...is the real Whitesnake. Tough and bluesy Mickey Moodey and Bernie Marsden lay down boogie riffs and the band as a whole does its best Foghat impression. I always considered the original whitesnake to be a poor man's Foghat or a homeless man's Deep Purple but that's almost an insult. This is a decent album, from a pretty decent bluesy/boogie/rock band. This was not, however, a sign of things to come with the Vandenberg years, this effort is honest rock and roll."
2,"""Come an Get it"" should be titled ""Leave it alone""",If your more than middle age and like ZZ Top type stuff this is for you. It's not my cup of tea.
5,Rock and Roll and Hard Rock Lesson,"If you want good rock, this is an album that can't miss in your collection. This Whitesnake's album sounds very diferent from nowadays.The initial song ""Come And Get It"" features an excelent drum riff by Ian Paice, with a very good timming guitar riff. The others songs are pure Hard Rock and Rock And Roll, with an bit of bluesiness and with some stupid lyrics, that's true, but fits very well in the music. ""Wine, Women And Song"", features a blues piano introduction with the powerful voice of David Coverdale. Listen to ""Would I Lie To You"", the amazing ""Child Of Babylon"", etc...This is a must have!"
5,An essential part of your child's Christian library!,"This is the best children's Bible out there. It has a story and a song for every verse of the Bible, plus memory verses for each book. If you have a child who is an auditory learner he/she will learn 66 songs and 66 verses! The dramatic reading and the flow of the stories is done very well. My kids have been listening to these CD's for four years (starting at age 3) and they still love them! In fact, we're on our second set--we wore the cassette tapes out!"
5,Well worth the price!,"This is the best bible you could purchase for your children. I bought this 4 years ago and it is still being used by my children. This bible holds the attention of my 2, 5 and 10 year-old children. The voice narrations are FABULOUS and the songs are the extra special touch. My 2 year-old always gets up to dance. I stumbled across this at Costco and I have gotten my money's worth 10x over (I paid $30). I bought a small tape player with batteries and we all sit on my bed at night and listen to a story. You WILL NOT be disappointed!"
3,Overpriced,"All downrods seem to be completely overpriced for what they are (a piece of pipe with a hole in them). But, since they are not typically included with fans, you don't have much of a choice."

5,Great Gift for Friends and Coworkers,"If you don't have a lot of money to spend this holiday season, but still want to give gifts people will love, check out this small bag of Ghiradelli chocolates! It's a great price for a small gift to a friend or coworker, and who doesn't love chocolate, right?! I just love the little tote bag, too! It's very stylish and makes a great lunchbag once the chocolate's all gone!"
1,Didn't do what I thought it would,"I honestly bought this product because I thought it worked like ipecac, and would help me to throw up if I feel gross... but unless you have to drink a WHOLE lot, it doesn't work that way. It could be just because I didn't take a lot each time I've tried it, but I'm not sure."
3,Enjoyed 'Love Without Conditions' More,"Although this book is good, and I continue to read it (almost finished), I have underlined very little in it. Compare this toLove Without Conditions: Reflections of the Christ Mind, which I read with greater speed, more underlining and with a more profound sense of satisfaction and increased awareness.I will be tryingThe Twelve Steps of Forgivenessnext, another Paul Ferrini book. I expect that I will gain much from it, since being able to love without conditions does require forgiveness."
2,Christmas Repulsed,"I love dance music, techno music, remixed music, and Christmas music, but I cannot love this album. Everytime I find a ""remixed christmas"" cd, I usually get it, just because I'm hoping someday there will be one that actually transforms traditional holiday songs into club anthems. Unforntuanately, all of them have the same trend. They sound like 4th graders having fun with a computer. This one, as foul as it is, is actually better than most, however.There Are a few songs that aren't bad, Hark The Harold Angels Sing isn't exactly regrooved, but it's nicely mixed. White Christmas has good usage of vocals and beats. The rest however . . . well, Carol of the Bells, for instance, sounds like someone banging pots and pans to the music of a very, VERY slow paced funeral march. It is so bad. There are Dj scribble sounds, a demoic voice that whispers ""Christmas"", whoosey moans like a smurf taking a crap. It's horrid. If you don't believe me, listen to the samples, they won't lie to you."
3,"One great track, that's all","I fully agree with other reviewers concerning the good value for money and the excellent last track of this CD. These two are very good reasons to buy this CD, which I'm happy I did.I must, on the other hand, disagree concerning the Requiem itself. It is OK. No ""mistakes"", but also nothing too brilliant. The choir is a bit boring from time to time, the soloists sound very average, and the whole setting is a little dull. I couldn't hear any drama in the music.There are so many better Requiem CDs (just browse Amazon, and see the highly-reviewed Requiems; yes, I guess they are more expensive), and for such a great piece of music, I wouldn't be satisfied with this ""OK"" performance."
3,I paid $1.00 for this recording...,"I found this recording available for $1.00 at the DOLLARAMA in Toronto, Canada. Can't go wrong for a dollar!"
3,Decent Compilation,"I haven't heard this album for a LONG time. Someone gave it 5 stars, I just wanted to make the correction that this is not a fantastic album, and not worth buying new. I would buy it used, maybe valued at $5. There are 2 sick canibus flows on here (Canibus tony touch/Dj Clue freestyle) but true heads probably already have them. I remember McGruff spits a cool flow over that old Tried By Twelve beat too."
2,Bad sound for sound FX,"Terrible. Plenty of sounds, but very bad quality. Why make a SOUND fx cd with awful sound? Lots of hissing on all tracks. Fade in and fade out times make 50% of the tracks unusable. Way too many explosions and cars, a couple of each is all most people need. Very disappointing. Make your own."
3,Sounds like..well sort of..well maybe..,From just reviewing the samples I would be hesitant to purchase this CD.Many of the sounds I sampled sounded much different from there titles..for exampl there was one called 18th Century Battle field sounds but instead it sounded more like exaggerated echo footsteps..its your money but with a mic and some pots and pans you could produce more realistic sounds..
2,"Great item, but not as described....","Warning to other shoppers--this lunch box is VERY small....no dimensions are given in the description, and I didn;t think to ask. But it's about 3"" x 8"" x 6"". Also, in the description it says that you will receive one of the two designs pictured. I did receive a ""bob the builder"" tin box, but a different design than shown.Despite the above disappointment, the lunch box is for a 3 year old after all, and he will love it. I'm keeping it and giving it, but I cannot recommend or trust this seller."

5,Beautiful!Deserves a grammy.,"In this album,SCC are far from their N Gatz We Truss days, when they had weak beats and poor lyrics.This album left me breathless:perfect harmony between beats n lyrics,amazing beats and mesmerizing RnB choruses.Especially Gangsta Luv, which youll wanna bump with your lady all night long.Among the best and most distinctive gangsta rap I ever heard.This cd speaks 4 itself."
5,Classic,"This was the last good album from hav & prod. The 'south central madness','livin' in a crime wave', 'n'gatz we truss', 'kickin game' albums and this are the ones to get. Everything after wasn't that good. The production is tight and the flows are tight. It's a must have if you like westcoast with quality. Also checkout the 'murdersquad' albums which were classics too with tracks like 'no peace' and 'touch on wood' and other good tracks. Peace!"
1,Unknown,"I do not know because the Green Gables Detectives book was never shipped to my address, even though I ordered it online from your site."
1,Not for practical real life use.,"Unless you have a computer brain this is not for practical every day use , have not read it packed with ""coded"" explanations that is difficult to understand"
2,Needs more backcountry,"I was really hoping I might catch a glimpse of a certain top-secret geyser basin in this video. If you are hoping for a peek at FGB, look somewhere else. If you are hoping to scout some awesome backcountry adventure terrain for your next big expedition, look somewhere else. This DVD features the front country, mostly stuff you can see from your car, just from above. On the other hand, if you just want a relaxing visual feast of Yellowstone, it is nice for that."
4,Great DVD,"Nice little documentary of the Park. I was there when this was shot , so it has special meaning for me. It does leave you wanting more though. Beautiful aerial views!"
3,Re-recorded hits from 1976,"Titled A Kind Of Hush and with a cover photo showing the original Herman's Hermits (minus bassist Karl Green!) from their 1966 movie Hold On!, the insert of this CD indicates that it contains the group's original hits from the 60's. However, the 20 tracks featured on this release are all re-recordings from 1976 with Karl Green on lead vocals/bass, Frank Renshaw on rhythm guitar/vocals, Derek Leckenby on lead guitar and Barry Whitwam on drums. The new versions are of course professionally done by this mid 70's incarnation of Herman's Hermits, and tracks like Sea Cruise, Hold On! and Don't Go Out Into The Rain are even better than the originals. However, if you want the original hits with Peter Noone on lead vocals, this CD is not what you're looking for. A big minus for the cover photo, which is highly misleading."
1,NOT Peter Noone YUK,This is NOT Peter Noone. How do you get a CD of Herman's Hermits WITH Peter Noone?!? BEWARE OF ALL CD's!!!!! check them carefully. Peter Noone is HARD to find!!!!!
5,The Passion Is Still There,"Adamo. What a voice! And what passion he puts into his songs.I highly recommend this collection. Most of your favorites are here. ""La Nuit"" is my utmost favorite!After decades of hits, these songs are still timeless. Whether you listen to French music all the time or are new to it. Let this start your music collection! You won't be disappointed. This is what music is all about!"
2,It's Really Chuck!,"Chuck was one of the real legends of rock'n roll that gave so much of himself to others. His classics from the 50's and 60's will always be the considered the foundation of the rock'n roll music, but this album has an edge on it that shows the master is not what he was 40 years ago. It's good to hear him still performing, but there comes a time when even the best need to hang up their guitars."
1,Love it but shipping way too high!!!!,"Torani sugar free almond syrup is my favorite and has been for years. Recently, the store where I used to purchase it told me that they are unable to carry it in the future. Much to my delight as a frequent Amazon customer, it was available online at a comparable price, but not as an Amazon product. OMG. I ordered a case and was shocked at the shipping cost!!!!!! I tried to cancel the order but the company said it had shipped, although I had immediately emailed and they were closed (Sunday).I will never order again from the company just because of this shipping cost experience. Although the almond flavor is still my favorite, I will switch to a different one."
3,"More fun, but more distracting, than the first","I've owned this and the first ""Echoes of Nature"" boxed set for almost 10 years now, primarily as ""white noise"" to drown out distractions. This second boxed set is a lot more fun than the first, especially if you've never been to the jungle -- pardon the pun, but listening to monkey calls is a real hoot. Unfortunately, that reduces their value as white noise. ""Wilderness River"" is still great for that purpose, almost as good as ""Ocean Waves"" from the first set.The other bummer is that the 5th CD is redundant if you already own the first set. But, at this price, you still can't go wrong -- just give it to someone as a gift!"
2,Too busy for a natural sounding cd,"When it comes to nature cd's, less is more to my ears. So often, including here it seems, the engineer seems to think that more is more, the more sounds they can fit in the mix, the better. What about non-distrcipt ambient sound from the forest? That seems to me the best and most relaxing part.The sound of running water is highly unrealistic as well. For my ears, too busy for a natural sounding cd. For the generous price, you might want to come to that conclusion yourself."
2,The Natural Sounds Of The Wilderness,"not what i expected. more jungle sounds than anything. I wanted rain, crickets, and storms"
1,"What is this?? definately NOT ""natural sounds""!!","That was supposed to be sounds of nature?? I assure all you people who don't get outside much that that's NOT the way it sounds! Some of the sample clips sound like someone shot a computer and recorded the noise it made with clips of bird songs recorded over it. (that and the water sounds like someone recorded the water going down a toilet) Awful, awful. I don't think the people who made these ""natural sounds"" have ever been outdoors, much less to a rainforest!! If you are looking for CONVINCING nature sounds I recommend you look some where else!"
4,The Dorymen,"Thanks for the quick shipment. It5s a very good read for the local people,since this boat is part of that history."
4,Doryman's Reflections is real Maine fisherman's tales ...,"I live on the coast of Maine and appreciate this book so much. It is well written, great descriptive details of fishing culture, history, politics, the people and the place."
1,Avoid due to quality control issues!,"This set is impressive, no doubt. The collection of films is fantastic; the packaging looks nice, but it's all over the internet: the way the discs are secured damages them.My set arrived-- with all of the discs on their spindles appropriately-- and EVERY ONE had significant scratches due to the method by which they were SCREWED ON to the spindles.Were I the only person with this issue, I wouldn't score this set so poorly, but I have talked to dozens of people who purchased the set. Only ONE received his without significant scratching. I've tried contacting Fox, but they have been no help at all."
2,Unnecessary cuts,"This is the first review for me--I do not usually make the time or have an inclination; nevertheless, I feel compelled after having purchased this version to warn future buyers that about 10 minutes of the film have been deleted from the original. One spot in particular is the poignant scene where Judge Priest is talking to his departed wife in their room as he stands before her picture. The early part is there, but then this version cuts abruptly to the cemetery scene. The full version gives greater depth to the character. I have no idea why this was felt necessary. What a dissapointment."
1,VERY BAD PACKAGING !!!!!!!!!,"Once again Fox gives us damaged discs due to dumb, careless packaging. These classic films deserve better! Every one of the discs in my set had scratches due to the style of packaging. I give the films 5 stars. The quality control I give 1 star. You will spend most of the day trying to remove the discs from the rubber backing. Shame on you Fox for not having more respect for your product, and the customers that buy them."
4,"The best DVD boxset of the year, definitely.","Even a Chinese audience like me would have known JOHN FORD as one of the greatest directors of all-time. Four-time-winning of Academy Awards for Best Director, he's created a large bundle of masterpieces in B&W; film history. This Boxset contains the full works during Ford's age when working at 20th Century Fox. The reason I brought down a star is that the package style of the boxset-it can't be more protective to the disc as I expected. Besides, YOUNG MR. LINCOLN in it is only the film, without any special fatures in the former CRITERION edition, maybe due to the limit of copyrights? Who knows?However, the service of AMAZON.com was truly acceptable. The whole boxset was brand new when I received it, which is hard to believe for a parcel that had crssed the Pacific...Hmm, but it's cost my whole month's salary. Dinner's been cancelled."
5,Will Rogers at his best,"Loved this movie. The wit and wisdom of Will Rogers, the singing, good triumphs over evil. Just a great dose of the South."
1,packaging,Packaging is a disgrace. Discs are hard to remove and are scratched. How i regret the purchase of this box set.
5,Rare and precious gem,"Cajete's book is a rare and precious gem that describes the native (indigenous) perspective and experience of the natural world. Everyone who cares about the environment ought to read it. Everyone who wants to know why there is epidemic disease, ill health, depression and imbalance in today's world can benefit from the information woven throughout this book."
4,"ATTN: All Fans Of ""The Kumars at No. 42""...","If that show was your cup of tea, then so is ""Goodness Gracious Me""! It's got most of the same staff and cast, you see. And the unwrinkled Meera Syal, (aka ""Granny"")!"
5,Great Improvement,"I had been pretty dissapointed in Lord of The Silent; I thought that all the interesting loose ends had been tied up at the end of the book. However, the Golden One brings the focus back on our favorite heroine, Amelia Peabody. The plot was delightfully complex and kept me on the edge of my seat. Even with Ramses and Nefret married, the book still had some tension, though I liked the series better before they were married. The book also did not tie up every single problem so we can all expect that the next Amelia Peabody mystery will be as interesting or better. However, I found Sethos' turn for the good a little unrealistic and I wished there was more from the rest of the family. This series is great for anyone who likes good mysteries or has an interest in Egyptology. Elizabeth Peters is a highly competant author who knows her subject and her Amelia Peabdody series is a pleasure to read."
3,"Good, but not great","I am a died in the wool Amelia and Emerson fan, but this latest book did not have the 'spit and vinegar' that I have come to expect from Peters. It was slow going in many sections and the thrill and excitement were not there for me. In other words, the plot(s) were flat. I still enjoyed the book and loved meeting the old characters again but they lacked the vim and vigor they had in earlier works. Of course Amelia and Emerson are getting older so the adventures are rightfully passed to the younger generation. But I hope to see the old Amelia return."
3,"The series is still fun, but it's not what it once was","Elizabeth Peters seems to be running out of steam with Amelia, Emerson, et. al. The series was once a really wonderful one. Now, I still follow along since I've liked the characters so much over the years, but the characters themselves seem tired at times, and the plots are predicatable and often flabby. Moreover, the humor -- once such an important part of the series -- is now much rarer. I still enjoy the books overall -- and The Golden One is no exception -- but they aren't what they once were."
3,"Just couldn't get ""into"" this book",I love this series but just couldn't get interested in this book; I almost had to make myself finish it. If you are a loyal fan you will get much more enjoyment out of this book than if it is the first time you have read the series. A bit predictable
3,Two Books in one,"I really enjoyed all of the ""Amelia"" stories, however, I felt as if this was two storylines stuffed into one book - the missing tomb and the adventures in Gaza. It would have been much more fun to have two books written; one on each topic instead of two unrelated storylines.Having said that, it was still a good read and I loved the development of Sethos and his daughter. Can't wait for the next one to come out."
3,If you love the Peabody/Emerson clan ...,"of course you'll need to read the latest installment. However I'd recommend getting a library copy if possible and waiting for paperback before purchasing a copy for your own shelves.As in the last few books in the series, Ms. Peters seems to have lost focus, unsure of how to treat the affects of the Great War on Amelia and company. The archeological mystery feels trivial in comparison to the happenings in the world beyond Luxor. The adventure into espionage is perfunctory and fragmented. And the way Sethos has become a Deus Ex Machina makes me irritated with a character I formerly loved.If I were truly honest, this book probably deserves less than 3 stars. But my enduring affection for the series made it readable. I just wish I hadn't paid hard cover prices."
4,Another fun Egyptian adventure,"Like all her books featuring Amanda Peabody (archeologist and egyptologist) this was a fun-filled book that was difficult to put down. If you've read the other books in the series, you'll happily revist some old friends (and enemies). All in all, a fun read."
3,No surprises.,I have read all of the books in this series and have enjoyed every one of them. This was a good read except it was not as entertaining as some of the other books. It was predictable nothing in the book was a surprise.
3,Enjoyable Read,Once again this is a serial book with the same characters but with different adventures but the story is very good an most enjoyable.
4,Wonderful story,"Great story, good characters. I listened to the book on audible. Loved the narrartor. My only complaint about the audible version, it was abridged."
4,Tiny and convient,"I originally got this so I could jeep my jump drive in my laptop without having it stick out the side (i have a SD card slot) but now i use it for everything. music on my gps device, pictures on my camera... its got room to fit everything yet is so tiny. its great"
5,Best thing since sliced bread!,I love this thing and wish I would have bought a third before the price went up! I keep one in my Nikon D80 camera and one in my wallet as a tiny 2gb usb drive!
2,Great connectivity; when it works,"This SD card works fine, but the USB connection is loose and spotty; so much so that it DOESN'T WORK more often than it does in computers without SD readers.This is my second card of this type with the same problem. It's a great idea that failed in execution."
2,"Mine was very bad, very bad.","I was very enthusiastic about this purchase. The design is amazing and it was the perfect product of my needs...on paper. But, after using it several times in SD card mode without a hitch, I switched it to USB Stick mode and it just flat out rebooted the computer. My guess is that it created a surge in the USB 2.0 port on my Lenovo T60p which are not known to fail. I tried again, same result this time with XP not being able to recognize the card. When it was removed from the USB port, the computer restarted again. Now no device I have can recognize it. This could be a fluke based on all the other reviews (why I bought the card) but not mine."
4,Great product experience,I wanted a memory which would be both fast to support video recording and easy to plug into the PC for downloading files.I've got no problem at all after about a month using it. It's recording video at 30 FPS in 640x480 just fine. I've got a Lumix camera and it's proven to be great for it.The USB extension works as expected though it seems a bit frail but being careful seems not to cause any trouble ;)Worked great for me.
4,It's been very good!!!,"it's the best to use between a palm Life drive, a camera pentax and a notebook. You don't need to remember to bring with you the cables!!!You can put anything in the SD: music, photos, data...You can use as a pen drive also!! it's worth if you want a tiny thing that you can do all."
4,Good concept in portability,"I didn't give the product a 5 star because the opening mechanism is a little bit fragile, I think if you use it to much or too hard probably it will break. In spite of that, the concept is great. I no longer carry around a SD card reader."
3,"These are nice, but darn expensive","I have 2 of the 1GB version of these, and they are absolutely fabulous, but 2GB for over one hundred dollars, no way, it's not worth it. I just bought a 2GB Kingston card for twenty dollars. 5 to 1. Crazy. Also, this card was announced 14 months ago. Why the delay??"
4,Wish it was Class 4 or higher.,I love the USB functionality of this card.I bought a 1Gb version when they were introduced (for much more) and couldn't stop showing it off to my friends. I just wish they came in a faster class.
5,Must Have for camera users,I have this and a 16gb regular card. This thing is so great and so fast that I use the 16gb as a backup! This is a photographers must have!
5,Just Wonderful,This product is just simply wonderful it added soooooo much memory to my new digital camera and now I can go back and enjoy my vacation all over again with all the pics that I was able to take
5,"Very Handy, Very Fast","This is as useful a gadget as I've bought in years. It's fast, it's handy (as there is no card reader to lug around) - a great way to upload photos as soon as you take them. I'd give this an A+."
5,does what it says on the tin,This product works effortlessly and is great for those of us with laptops that don't have SD card slots yet. Transfer speeds are also excellent. Great job guys. I use this with my CanonCanon PowerShot SD870IS 8MP Digital Camera with 3.8x Wide Angle Optical Image Stabilized Zoom (Silver)and it works great. The unit feels very sturdy and easily withstands lots of switching between SD and USB modes.
5,rolls royce of sd cards,"blazing fast, usb functionality is great. hard to find though, makes me think they may stop making them."
5,Love the Interface,"I purchase these cards for cameras and Palm PDA's because I can leave the transfer cables at home on a trip. I also recommend the speed of the Ultra II line, which comes at a reasonable price. But it is very sharp to pop one of these cards out of a PDA or camera and use as an emergency USB thumb drive. I would recommend these cards to anyone."
3,a traditional buddist monk experiance,"This album is a bit different for that of laswell and bernocchi. The album is very traditional, with heavelly laiden chanting and ambience, after about every 2 min or so they break out into a furious rage of tibetan drums, horns, bells, very kaotic no real beat, lots of loose ripping. All except for fluid emations, which after the riping which only lasts of a few seconds, laswell kicks in the dub bass with very soft sounds and light airy drums, then back to the ripping. It wasnt exactelly what i was expecting but none the less a laswell classic. If youve got all the laswell but this one buy it i did."
5,101st Airborne - WW II,"Excellent, excellent book on the 101st Airborne Division and their exploits during WWII. Brilliantly written and fantastically described by one who was actually there!"
5,One of the best,"Donald R. Burgett has produced four excellent works concerning his experiences while a member of Col. Bob Sink's 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment of the fabled 101st Airborne Division. His details of his experiences of training and jumping into battle at Normandy put you right in the thick of his experiences. His graphic descriptions of what he saw, smelled, tasted and felt will bring you right into this environment like no other book I've read. The action comes fast and this is a book that you can't put down and will read from chapter to chapter and then be disappointed when you finish the book if you don't have his next work about Operation Market garden,The Road to Arnhem.I recommend all of Burgett's books about his experiences and the humble man who wrote them. This is a must read for WWII history fans and 101st Airborne fans."
2,world war stories,The book was easy reading and interesting. I thought the book is overpriced for a paperback and the size.We have heard good reviews about this author who writes of his true experience during World War II
3,Not too bad...,"This book is written in common language and easy to read. Some parts seem a little far-fetched, though. Over all it is still a good read for WWII or paratrooper buffs."
3,Nice Account of Paratroopers in Normandy,This book is a quick read and a good account by someone who was actually a paratrooper in the Normandy invasion. It is not nearly as comprehensive as the Band of Brothers and other books on Major Winters. You may be disappointed if you have read them already.
1,sub zero,"Lied to, storied, misrepresentation. Will never deal with this vendor again. If you see the name ""Woddy"" forget it.Tres bad experience and dishonest dealings..W. R. Murphy"
3,Currahee!,"The book Currahee is about an army division in World War two. It shows the struggles and terrifying experiences of each soldier. These men in 7 days fought some of the most ferocious combats in World War two. The experiences of these men were shocking but true. This book portrays World War two like it really was.I didn't really like or hate this book, it was in between. This book had a lot of boring parts, but also had a few good parts. This relates to The Pearl because the villagers were fighting Kino for the pearl and that was over a stupid reason and in the war we fought for a stupid reason when we could have just kept the peace like in The Pearl. I would recommend this book to someone who likes war history"
2,Expresses the author's personal ego,"This is Burgett's personal account in Operation Overlord. I have the greatest respect for what Screaming eagles did in Normandy, but Burgett is a prima donna and it shows!"
4,Cool and different,"Missile Girl Scoot is a great band with a female lead vocalist, but two guys who chime in from time to time, too. The sound's a little bit like Linkin' Park, but with a more industrial back beat. Lyrics (in Japanese) are pretty much indecipherable, but it's cool music to listen to while driving, or at a party. Not something you'd sing along to in the shower, but it does really rock. Missile Girl Scoot is totally hardcore."
5,SPEED,"Z-RO'S LIRYCS COME SPITTING OUT IN A HIGH FAST VOLOCITY SPEED.THERE ARE NOT TOO MANY TOUNGE TWISTING RAPPERS LEFT.HE BRINGS HIS OWN STYLE TO THA TABLE.THA MANS COLD,THA ONLY OBSTACLE LEFT FOR HIM TO BLOW UP IS TIME.HE'S GOT ALOT OF POTENTIAL."
4,Z-r0,"z-ro is a very skilled lyricist with a tite azz flo. if you cain't feel his raps then there's probably something wrong with you or you're on that played out overrated east coast style shyrt thinkin' thats the only thing worth listenin to (i hate you S.O.B's!) i've listened to alot of rap music in my day and z-ro is one of the best artists i've ever heard spit. it's hard to believe more people ain't caught on to him yet, he deserves to be a nationwide millionaire just like all the commercial rappers who don't come with half the skill or possess half of 'Ro's talent. there ain't no such thing as a wack song by this mane, you can put his cds in and jus let the whole thang play through. everything about his cd's is tite..lyrics, delivery, the instrumentals, everything. if you're sick and tired of the same Jay-Z, Nas, Eminem bulls--- then go pick up a copy of ""Look what they did to me,"" and after that go pick up all his other releases too and you ain't gon be sorry."
5,Greatest Album Ever,"With too many rappers releasing mediocre albums, Z-Ro certainly sets the standard for quality in an album. He doesn't tire you out with the same flow on every track. Each time, he hits you with something newer, and better. And with his varying speeds, he is untouchable. Another great aspect of the album is his inspirational lyrics. He writes lyrics like no other, and I can honestly say that every single line on the album blew me away completely. You would be amazed at the thought he puts into his songs. Some of the featured artists have average performances, but everything Z-Ro did was top rate. He also did all of the singing on the album, which certainly puts him a cut above the rest of the rappers out there. I guarantee that you will not be disappointed with this album."
1,"Terrible, thin, bassless sound","The only reason I give these speakers one star is because there's no 'zero' option. The sound is actually worse than the integral speakers on my laptop - 75% top, 25% middle and no discernible bass end. The USB dongle is badly engineered - it was loose in the USB slot, and the mini jack was loose in the dongle. On a friends say-so, I've now tried the Logitech X-140, and I can recommend these speakers without hesitation."
2,Disappointing,"A few things they dont tell you1) the speakers have a standard mini audio connector with a 5mm->USB adapter which is about an inch and a bit in length. This is disappointing because i wanted to plug the speakers into my keyboard or monitor which have USB outlets and this is too large and unsightly for that.2) The cable is a nasty tangly sticky clear wire style very thin wire, im sure youve seen this kind before it is contributes to a wire rats nest very easily.3) Sound quality is poor, overpoweringly strong sound in the high ranges with weak mid-range obviously almost no bass (considering the price and size you would have to expect the bass problem). The simulated 7.1 is a gimmick.If you intend to listen to any music at all, dont buy it."
1,Don't waste you money buy Logitech instead,"As a computer teacher with a variety of systems to test these speakers, you'd think I could get them to work.... Think again. The systems I tried don't recognize the USB device. Used the disk, tried alternate, and creative ways to install the drivers, downloaded drivers on the PLEOMAX website, tried XP and VISTA ... no luck.Also bought the Logitech S150 USB Speaker Oem which worked right out of the box! And for half the price!"
3,Doesn't work with Vista,"I tried to get the speakers to work with Vista repeatedly on Dell Inspiron 530 with no luck. Dowloaded drivers from Samsung Pleomax website, ran supplied CD-Rom in XP compatibility mode, etc. but couldn't get them to work. Kept getting errors to insert USB Audo device (which was already inserted) or something about C-Media Device. I know the product doesn't specifically say it works with Vista, but shouldn't be that difficult to get speakers to work..."
5,Reread this one.,"Another book club selection. I read it years ago, but enjoyed revisiting it. Good story with some insight into the Catholic church."
3,Religous Mystery,"I finally finished this book, but it was a little difficult for me. I wanted to see how the mystery and plot worked out and so I did. I had trouble in two areas. The first was that I kept waiting for that place in the book where you are finally so grabbed by the plot that you are compelled to finish as soon as possible. Sadly, I never found that. Secondly, I was a put off by a number of ethnic and sexual slurs that would not be acceptable if published today. The book was written over 20 years ago. The murder concept was intriguing, but you have to work to get through this one."
4,The Rosary Murders,"I thoroughly enjoy this mystery. It was fast moving, I had a hard time putting it down. If you like good mysteries, I would definitely recommend this."
4,Good mystery,I'm glad I discovered this series. I liked the characters and the mystery was interesting and well-paced. I will read the other books in the series.
2,Interesting but opinionated,"This book is an interesting read if you are willing to sift through the authors personal opinions, a lot of which goes off on a tangent and at some places there are paragraphs that don't seem to follow on from or have relevance to previous paragraphs. The author seems to dislike men and religion in general and unfortunately she seems to have used this book as a platform to purvey that sentiment rather than telling the story that was intended."
5,Good and Informative,"I've only read a few pages so far, but I find it to be well written and informative. Looks like a good read."
1,Huge Disappointment,"If you've ever read any of her other books, you'll find that many of those ""theories"" presented were regurgitated in this book. She failed to remain objective and I felt like she was pushing her ideas down my throat. I'm not even sure she proved her point on what this book was supposed to be about. I was too annoyed with what felt like whining for someone to believe every word she said and if she got to her point I missed it. Maybe she was being pressured to release another book too soon and just threw this together. I've enjoyed her other books but I wouldn't recommend this one."
3,I remember it being scarier.,"Of course, I was also about eight when this came out. It's kind of cute and cool in a nostalgic kinda way, but it's overall still just a basic Hollywood movie."
5,a favorite,this is one of my favorite movies! I especially enjoy the special effects with the sand - and the guy who plays the Mummy is pretty hot too.
4,The Mummy,It's a trip. So much better than the sequels. Good family entertainment. We were glad we got it. How many more words?
4,ekco,Very well written. Accuracy not to sure. My wife and I were raised in that area and are unaware of communities talked about in the book.
2,A bit disappointing,There were no reviews at this site when I ordered the book. I wish there had been - as I thought the book would be set around the 1900s and the only story that was set in that time frame was the first. The first story WAS good. But I had purchased it more for research into the Victorian times in North Dakota and so I was disappointed. I was also disappointed in how little I got for my money. The rest of the stories were only so-so.
2,"Some good material, but too many asides to wade through","The only good part of the book is his enthusiasm and his knack for getting ""right to it"" in his life. The idea of not waiting but doing it right now is well illustrated.But most of his pointers are copied from others or are ones that we have all heard before. Very little original.Plus he blends his points with crude and crass examples which detract from the book.He is a good example that you can have money without having class."
1,Candles and you,"One reviewer (from Moscow, Russian Federation) wrote:""It is expecting success in the future and doing the best you can to help God make you prosper (and this does not mean lighting lots of candles in churches, at least not limited by that). ""Maybe the reviewer doesn't realize that God can only communicate via candles, which is why we light them. To omit the candles would be to nullify any aspect of the wish / prayer."
4,Pat Croce feels great and I do too!,"whether or not you know the name pat croce, once you read his inspirational story you can't help but know the name. his motivation and drive launched him from the training room of sports injuries to the front office of sports ownership. an endless go-getter who went and got, pat croce reminds the reader to be hopelessly positive. his 'ten commandments of customer service' is a bible of business. and if owning the 76ers basketball team and starting the high-altitude Slamball league weren't enough, Pat Croce is also a highly motivated motivational speaker, author, television personality, and as his book says 'big scorer.' he'll tell you the secrets to being able to drain that 3-pointer, block that kick, and make that sale (though not all at the same time)! don't think of him so much as an 'entrepreneur' but more as an 'encourageneur.' he even inspired me to write this review! read this book!"
2,Disappointing Read,"If you pick up this book and expect to get a lot of insight on how to develop personal success or feeling great, this book isn't for you. I picked up this book expecting lots of insight, and saw many shallow, reworked quotes that have been used by other people. I got something out of his customer service commandments, but that was one chapter out of a book. He kept talking about feeling great, sustaining all kinds of energy, but he really never got into the deeper discussion on how he did it.If you pick up this book for a quick laugh and lighthearted reading, then this book is for you. It wasn't a bad book if you want to hear his life story, I just felt it didn't give a lot of in depth information. There were a lot of adolescent anecdotes and funny tales, definitely a book geared at ""one of the boys"", since a lot of the humor in the beginning of the book was directed at the male passage through college."
5,"I feel great, too, Pat!","Ok, I was pretty excited when I heard about this book. Not only am I a long-time South Philly resident (10 years and counting, baby), but a big fan of Mr. Croce. The energy he brings to the city of Philadelphia is more important than those politician people, what do you call them- politicans. Yea, ok, anyway, I am so inspired by his new book, I'm 19 but have the energy of a 12 year old. Don't you think that's nuts? Buy this book!"
5,Motivating,"I heard Pat speak and was so moved I bought and then quickly read his book. It's a page turner. It starts a little slow and uses some colorful language (PG-13), but that's Pat. Hang in there though, because the last few chapters are very good. His 10 commandments of Customer Service are awesome! Made me feel Great!"
2,Doesn't Hold Up,I don't honestly remember if they made any claims about this products durability but as with many dog toys...it took my GSP 2 days to tear it apart and get to the squeaker inside! It was fun while it lasted.
1,not for agressive play,"I purchased two of these hoping that my Bostons would enjoy playing with the toy; however, the first one lasted approx. 20-minutes before it was destroyed in a tug of war battle so I gave the second one to someone w/ a dog not so agressive. The AKC rabbit and squirrel last much much longer and I would recommend them hands down over this monkey."
1,Destroyed in minutes,"I decided to give this a try based on the good feedback. On the positive side, my 50 pound lab loved this toy. Unfortunately, the tail was ripped off and the the monkey was disemboweled in a matter of minutes. If your dog is an adept chewer I recommend the Coleman or Kong material toys."
5,Great dog toy,"Bought this toy for our 4-month-old poodle. It's his favorite toy and with his razor-sharp little teeth biting it constantly, it still looks likes new. He loves the squeaker. Definitely would recommend."
2,not so good,My 3 month old lab puppy didn't like it much. He occasionally picks it up. Not attractive for puppies.
2,Durability issues,"My puppy really loved this toy, but he put a hole in the seam on the first day playing with it! I let him play with it supervised, but I don't want him swallowing the stuffing. It's really too bad, it was one of the few toys he really took to.Maybe it was just his sharp puppy teeth as the other reviews rave about this toy. I was disappointed."
3,Monkeyz!,Well the first thing the dog did was get rid of the tail and ears. The noise maker lasted about a week. My dog is extremely rough on soft toys and feels that they all need to be destuffed and to have an end put to the noises - so this was a long time for it to last. The head no longer has stuffing but it is still carried around the house and I am able to insert squeakers from other toys. It is more durable than a few of the other plushy toys that I have purchased.
4,"Not bad, but could use a better squeaker",My dog loses interest in it fairly quickly because it's hard to make squeak. But it is durable- he tries to tear it apart and hasn't yet.
1,Cute but DESTROYED by chewers,"Big chewers in my house, and they ripped it to shreds the first day, in a matter of a few minutes. Sorry. It is really cute and probably perfect for small dogs or light chewers."
1,Not puppy-proof at all,"I had ordered this toy so I had something to give a 5 week old boxer mix pup I was adopting when I went to pick him up.He hadn't had this monkey for no more than 5 minutes when I had begun to hear tearing noises; 20 minutes after giving it to him, he was running around the house with the squeaker.Was very disappointed. This may be a great product for dogs that have passed their teething stages, but for those that haven't, stick to toys that you know are truly ""indestructible"" LOL like Gorilla toys."
3,not washable,"My puppy/dog loves her monkey! I have purchased 3 so far for her in the 4 months I have had her. The squeaker breaks easily however. But regardless, she still loves her monkey, it's more of a comfort toy for her as she tends to suck on its belly. I wish it was washable, so as I hand wash them, I interchange them out. Would be much better if toy was machine washable."
3,B Collision,Just finished listening to this collection and I'm going to play it again.This one has a little bit different sound than what I've learned to expect from the David Crowder Band. I have a soft spot for good banjo music and this was no disappointment. This collection is a bit small from what they normally put together but very good nonetheless.
5,A great addition to your Crowder Collection,"A bluegrass version of several of the band's great songs from A Collision - ""Wholly Yours"", A Beautiful Collision"",and live versions of ""Be Lifted"" and ""I Saw the Light"" with Shane & Shane and Robbie Seay.The more Crowder I hear, the more I like! What an awesome ministry!"
4,Here it comes.. a beautiful collision!,"David Crowder*Band produces another great album! B Collision is a great addition for any Crowder fan. With faves from A Collision remixed and reinvented, this album is a real gem. There are even a few live versions of some other greats like ""I Saw the Light"". Don't forget the full version of ""Everybody Wants to go to Heaven"". It is definitely one that gets stuck in your head!"
2,Too much jazz filler!,"I bought both Vols. 1 and 2, and saw them one after the other, and I noticed to much jazz filler in both. I want blues. I love and respect the jazz ladies (Holliday, Leena Horn, et. al.) but I bought this for the blues. It could have contained more Delta guys, some Chicago artists, West Coast blues, Texas... come on! There's more out there to have made a beautiful video but the jazz filler just doesn't seem right on a blues video. And please don't tell me Billie Holliday is blues!"
5,Better than pills for insomnia!,"Seriously, if you have trouble sleeping, these CDs are wonderful; they lull you off to sleep. I used to turn on the dishwasher (really) to help me sleep. For some reason the sound of water is very soothing and restful. Best recommendation: there are 2 tracks per CD, and I've never heard track 2 on ANY of them, have dozed off by then!"
4,Relaxing without the crazy background music,"There is some background music on these CDs, but it's not intrusive to the sounds of nature. I've listened to some nature CDs that included loud music over the streams or storms. This music is as soft and as soothing as the nature sounds - and compliments the sounds rather than covering it.If you need to relax, these CDs are for you. They're a great value, too!"
2,Music is a relative term here,"I thought the nature sounds would be beautifully enhanced with lovely classical music... instead, I get nature sounds with a dirge in the background. The ""digitally enhanced"" music (sic) sounds are depressing, overwhelming, and make this a poor choice for anyone who is used to the Serenity series of music and nature CDs, or the Simply Serene series. There is nothing serene about these. After attempting to ""listen"" to two of them, I am ready to toss them. A waste of money and a waste of time. Avoid!"
4,"Outstanding, but..","The vendor delivered a week ahead of the promised date. Great! However, I ordered (thought I did anyway) closed-toe stockings but got the open-toe style instead. They do the job of keeping leg swelling down, but the foot area rolls up."
4,Works,"Takes a little practice to get them on, but they do the job. Arrived after a 10 hour flight with feet and legs intact. Many passengers had swollen feet and legs. A little long. I should have tried a shorter sock but wanted the open toes for comfort."
3,Jobst compression stockings,"These stockings are not as tight as I expected, and therefore, they don't really give me the comfort I was expecting. They don't stay up on my legs as well as they should, and at the end of the day, they are sliding down toward my ankles."
2,Lacks real content,"Whilst I am in awe of Sri Krishnamacharya and have been for many years, this book, written by his son, is a very difficult and dry read. At page 81, I just gave up and getting to that page took me a couple of months! It is also tiring to constantly read how great Sri K. was - I know that already!There is very little if any information on the discoveries that Sri K. made from studying Sanskrit literature sprinkled all over India. There is also very little information of his life, hardships and realtionships with his chief disciples.Interpretation of the Patanjali Sutras is also done from a very physical Hatha point of view which I have never agreed with - see ""Bringing the Inner God to Life"" by Swami Shankarananda Giri or learn Kriya Meditation to see what I mean. The book by Swami Shankarananda Giri is a translation of Patanjali's Sutras and goes much deeper and beyond Hatha Yoga and presents more logical arguments."
4,"moody and soulful, I've been listening to it over and over..","The first song ""Charade"" is a pointed commentary on the false selves we present to the world rather than trusting that who we really are will be liked and accepted. It hooked me right away. Rachid's music is interesting and intense, and his voice is sensual and filled with emotion. I loved the mixtures of sounds and beats on this CD. His music makes you feel connected to him as you enjoy its rhythms."
4,Rachid Makes an Excellent Debut,"The album ""Prototype"" proves that the entire music industry doesn't rely on formulas. While the album lacks the visual luster of most CD's out now, it more than makes up for it in it's musical content. The production on ""Prototype"" is top notch and more than rivals that of most of the more well known production teams in the business. Rachid is a wonderful lyricist who makes you stop in your tracks and pay attention to what he has to say. His voice though is the selling point of ""Prototype"". Rachid journeys through R&B, Pop, Rock, Dance, and Indie within the span of a few songs. He moves in and out of moods like a spider, and his moves are just as intentional. Rachid is a young man who knows what he is doing and I look forward to future music from this brilliant artist."
5,Rachid fan,The vocals are some of the most incredible in years....a singers singer... and evidence of how screwed up the record business has become... and also proof that success in the industry has nothing to do with talent....excellent album w/amazing lyrical content & music production as well....Bravo Rachid & thanks
5,"This CD is amazing, but....","I swear I saw Rachid on Apollo Theater's Amateur Night. I didn't catch the guys name, he looked just like Rachid but a little heavier. It's hard to tell just by looking at him, but they sing just a like with the high notes and everything, so it must be him."
5,Rachid is Da Bomb!,"Rachid is Da Bomb! I listened to this CD, ""Prototype,"" and his soulful music style is da bomb and I love the way it sounds. It is really a good CD to keep you happy or sad. I say to buy it!"
2,Not up to snuff,"From the very amateurish cover to the demo-quality sound, Rachid's debut is an album full of good intentions gone awry. Unfortunately, while he is ambitious, he lacks the hubris to really listen and carefully edit, and he tends to do a little too much showing off."
2,Overrated but good intentioned,"One look at the album cover, and I hate to say it, but you can tell the lack of overall quality that went into this album. It feels like a demo, with lousy reverb, cheezy strings. There are hints of inspiration, like the submerged drum'n'bass influence and the awkward string passages, but these seem more forced and show-offy than an integral part of his sound. Amazingly enough, they managed to get a stellar cast of supporting artists, like downtown bassist Greg Cohen, but the overall feel is that of someone who is yet unformed. You'd be better buying Terence Trent D'Arby, Prince, or D'Angelo, for solid soul. Maybe even look for Neneh Cherry's import releases. But Rachid is not yet an important musician."
5,Very enjoyable short listen,"This unabridged lecture on Socrates (469-399 B.C.) covers all of the major aspects of the life of the famed Ancient Greek philosopher including his personal life, his military career (he served with distinction as a hoplite, the Athenian equivalent of a buck private), the sordid story of his execution by the government of Athens, his influences, who he influenced, his impact, both good and bad, on Western society and more. Throw in the entertaining (and surprisingly approachable considering it is about philosophy) text and the great delivery by narrator Robert Whitfield and this short little audiobook is a well worth listen."
2,"A good try, but...","I found this book to contain all the necessary information a Differential Equations textbook should have, but it was often presented in such a way as to make it confusing to the reader, if the reader did not already know the subject matter. The main problem is that concepts are more exhibited than explained."
3,GREAT LOOKING DVD.....BUT.....,This is a good looking package. The print is fine and the color and photography are sumptuous. But the film itself is another matter. The dubbing is laughable with voices mismatched to the characters so that whole scenes are comical when they should be serious. The victims are too healthy looking and pretty and costumed for a rock video---not the Whitechapel period of the Ripper. And boy do those costumes come off fast. The girls don't even put up a fight. They just whimper. The gore is confined to one scene that's gross but not very convincing. Klaus Kinski is sufficiently sinister as Jack but he just mopes around and tangles with the girls. So this is just a sexploitation effort by Franco although it looks good. Too bad it isn't.
3,twisted version of the old ripper legend,"This film is a relatively decent portrayal of the ripper murders of the late 1880's. Klaus Kiniski does a very good job depicting the mental instability that must have plagued the real Jack the Ripper. Overall , I was a bit dissappointed in the film's relative lack of gore considering the unsavory reputation this film supposedly has. But there is plenty of atmosphere and a touch of gothic to the fim's ambience. If you want blood and graphic depictions of murder check out New York Ripper instead, but if you are in the mood for a good european style thriller with some creepy atmosphere and an even creepier actor then check out Jack the Ripper."
1,One of the worst !,Terrible acting + bad dubbing + very slow development + stupid ending = lousy movie. The title begins the great deception on the viewer. The story has almost nothing to do with Jack the Ripper. What a waste of time.
2,"One of Franco's ""better"" movies. That is not good.","Make no mistake about it, the movie is very poorly made and has laughable acting, but this one is still entertaining. ""Jack The Ripper,"" One of Jesus' most well known films, is a test for average film goers. Necrophilia (almost) and really low budget gore make this movie hard for the ""Lord Of The Rings"" viewer to witness. But that fact is the beauty of it all. If you ever watch a Fraco movie it's a badge of honor: ""Hey, that movie was funny as junk, it was awesome."" Jesus Franco's perception of The Ripper is a unique one, making him an insane doctor who treats the less than fortunate Fellow. Warm hearted doctor Luv by day, Cold blooded pscho necrphyliac murderer. Doesn't fit, but is certainly entertaining. Great camp perfornces from Kinski(Jack) and Romay (uh... wife.)"
2,I first saw this movie when i was 8...,"...it had a big effect on how i look at real life(or supposedly real life) murderers. I just recently got into watching Jes Franco movies for the lone fact that that his ideas and movies were a huge sampling source for one of my all time favourite bands, Thrill Kill Kult. I have since seen 5 of his movies and am not impressed. he is not a bad director but he is way below average. this movie is very interesting to see the Frac's opinion on who Jack the Ripper is, and i like it. Go see FROM HELL, which is written by Watchmen/Miracleman creator Alan Moore. talk about messed up souls..."
1,Jack The Ripoff!,"This Jess Franco film is as bad as it gets. I will not waste either my time or those of reviewers with a long diatribe. Unless you want to build a collection of the worst films ever made, then you probably want to stay clear this Jack The Ripoff who lurks the dark corners of your video store.All I can say is that I bought this film because I'm a Klaus Kinski fan: particularly of his work with Herzog. Without knowing it, this catchy title with Klaus Kinski caught my attention in an obscure corner of the video store very much like the infamous killer jumped on his victims from out of the London fog. Next thing I know, I fall victim to the jabbing pain of pathetic scenes and horribly fake special effects.This is quite a stretch from Herzog's work and Klaus Kinski is horribly underused in this film: he barely utters any lines! Everything about this film is cheap and just bad: the plot, the acting, the directing, the filming, everything! Avoid this film at all costs!"
2,"Warning: Most of you will not be able to watch this ""Jack""","With the release of ""From Hell"" sure to revive interest in Jack the Ripper, this 1976 effort from exploitation director Jesus ""Jess"" Franco is going to get some revived interest. But this ""Jack the Ripper"" is only loosely based on the historic murders. Klaus Kinski plays the title character and his ""true"" identity of Dr. Orloff. The explanation here is that ""Jack"" was abused by his prostitute mother and so he starts butchering prostitutes on the streets of London. Even in a film career based on dishing out the gory, Franco finds a way to go way over the top with this one. This is a movie of stomach turning, savage violence that is rated ""R"" only because they did not have NC-17 way back then. You do not want to know anybody who can laugh their way through the gore in this one. The DVD version includes the theatrical trailer (""Close your eyes and whisper his name...""), photo stills and liner notes."
3,This is Jess Franco we're talking about....,"Sure, this movie isn't much good. A lot of time it looks as if it were made by a small child. Did they even have a script? But all that's really beside the point for fans of this stuff. Here's the great Klaus Kinski in a Jess Franco movie! Wonder if he slept with Lina Romay? Klaus slept with everyone else, at least according to his book.Klaus stalks, female flesh is exposed, blood flows, and Jess does something that might, in a pinch, even pass for direction. What are you waiting for? Buy this DVD!"
1,Thanksgiving Dinner,"Definitely one for Thanksgiving Dinner - a real turkeyPutting on one side the appalling print and sound quality, and suffering from a dreadful transfer to DVD, the film itself should get an award for awfulness.Inept mis-en-scene, risible dubbed dialogue, incoherent story, and pathetic acting. Why Kinski & Chaplin got involved, goodness alone knows. How do people raise money for ventures like this?Plus points - it's cheap and in a decent jewel case!"
2,Very Disappointing,"I'm a big boxing fan and a big fan of Don Dunphy. I really looked forward to hearing these fights. However, I was very disappointed. The poor sound quality is excusable - you have to use the material that's available. What's not excusable to me is that only the highlights of the fights are presented. Instead this CD seems to be a promo for Bill Cayton. Before and after every round there is an announcement that this recording is brought to you by Bill Cayton. Someone should just put the entire recording of the fights on CD. That's what anyone really wants to hear, not constant promos."
1,Very disappointed!,"I bought this gift for a young girl wanting crafting supplies for Christmas from a local gifting tree. It just arrived and I am completely disappointed. Last night while walking through WalMart crafts department to add to her packages, they had every item in this barrel and I am SURE I could put it together for a fraction of the price they charge!! PUT ONE TOGETHER YOURSELF AND SAVE MONEY!!!"
5,Big hit with 6-year-old niece,"My niece is turning into a craft junkie. Spending a day with grandma, she was quiet for hours, turning a spare piece of felt into a bear.Unwrapping this, her eyes widened and she jumped up and down. She had to be forcibly constrained from spilling all its contents all over the floor at that instant to start creating new stuff.The only item that I don't think this contained that would be great would be some kinds of fabric -- felt, or easy to cut cotton of some kind. With glue and all the exciting items in this barrel, that would add immensely to the fun. (If fabric was supposed to be in here, it was invisible; even without it, there's so much that my sister-in-law won't have to take my niece to a craft store until for another six to nine months!)Well worth the investment."
2,It is not a Barrel. It is a bottle of over priced stuff,It is just over priced. I paid $30 plus $10 shipping for this. I could get these stuff from a local craft shop with half the cost.
1,"No Signals, No Sex, No Nothing.","I read the first 20 pages or so, then paged through well over half the book, stopping here and there to read a bit, then threw it in the waste basket. No Signals. No Sex. No Nothing. An article in Cosmo has at least *some* information in the way cotton candy has *some* food value. This book has a good title and no worth."
2,Good tacky 70s fun,"What can you say? There's no great art here. There's Teresa Graves, a long, tall good-lookin' woman, catch phrases (""You're under arrest, sugah!"") and lots of afros, bellbottoms, and butt-kicking as Christy Love cleans out a nest of drug dealers - her way. There's nothing innovative here, and definitely no great acting, but this was only an ABC TV-movie meant to introduce the short-lived TV series. Now, of course, it looks like tacky 70s kitsch, and that's exactly what it is. Great fun but don't pay a lot for it, and don't expect too terribly much."
3,Get Christie Love,I enjoyed this show when I was much younger. The show captured pretty well the televised version. I would like to see more if there is more.
4,ACTION-PACKED MOVIE THAT LEAVES YOU WANTING MORE,THIS MOVIE WAS RECOMMENDED TO ME A FEW YEARS AGO AND I FINALLY FOUND IT ON AMAZON.COM. THE MOVIE WAS SUPRISINGLY VERY GOOD. TERESA GRAVES GAVE A SUPERB PERFORMANCE AND KICKED...IN THE PROCESS. I LOVE THE 70'S FASHION. THE MOVIE LEFT ME WANTING MORE....
4,YOU'RE NOT GETTING A TIP,"Christie Love (Teresa Graves) is really a substandard cop who is too direct. She manages to subdue her opponent even though she can't kick her foot higher than a guy's kneecap. She goes after a heroin dealer with about as much tact as Peter Sellers. The film causally drops the n-word without anyone getting sued or charged with a hate crime. All the cops had big hair back then. There was no concern over warrants and jurisdictions. A credit card could open any dead bolt lock.The film has camp value if you pay attention. Oh yes. It is nice to know a street hooker costs the same now as it did in 1974. How do they get by?Parental Guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity.In an early scene a would-be John calls prostitute posing Christie the N-word when she asks for too much money. She causally walks off calling him a ""N-lover."" In 1974 I would not have thought nothing of this scene. Now it is worth noting in how times have changed in one generation."
4,Flash from the past!,I remembered this movie from high-school. I wanted it mainly to get ideas for a 70's theme party and I remembered the star role was very classy/chic. The clothing was on-target for what I was looking for. Quite humorous as I've matured alot since then. But is still good to reflect on what was then vs. what is now.Very nostalgic!
1,Wasted Potential,"The potential for this book was tremendous. The author is the daughter of Lolita Lebron, the Puertorican independentist imprisoned for, along with a group of men, storming Congress and riddling it with bullets.Instead of telling us what it was like growing up in a *revolutionary* atmosphere, during the short spurts of time spent with her mother - or offering some insight into who her mother was and how she became what she became, instead Irene Vilar obsesses on a tenuous thread of mental illness and wastes an opportunity to tell a great story.There remains a great story to be told."
5,very good,"simple & cool. I love the relaxing ambient-dubby sound of this CD. It doesn't require lot's of free perception, and slowly drives you itno very pleasant atmosphere. Very hipnotic bass lines :) I like to fall a sleep upon the 3d copmosition (it has a very strong mood) :) Some times U just need 2 come back & listen it again. Laswell superb!If U like this, I would recommend you, his Divination: Ambient Dub Vol. II"
5,GREAT REMAKE,CAPITAL DID A GREAT JOB ON THIS KEEP RELEASING THE CLASSIC BEACH BOYS ALBUM. CANT WAIT TO SEE WHAT THEY DO IN 2011. 50 YEARS OF THE BEACH BOYSTHANK YOU BRIAN WILSON!!!!!!
1,Very Disappointing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I bought this CD hoping that Capitol would finally release the stereo version of this classic song. Only the music has been released in stereo as part of their boxset. I have read somewhere that the vocals had been lost which is supposedly why we are getting the same mono version once again; but I don't buy it! Oopps.....I already did! But seriously, don't waste your money on this one folks."
2,Good Vibrations,Thios is not what I thought I was getting. It is one song peformed in a variety of ways.
2,Not the best book I ever read,"Unlike everyone else in the world, I did not find this book to be all that great.A guy goes to baseball games or watches them on TV and gives you his side of things.Save yer money and come to my house I can do the same thing. Not much to hold my interest other than watching Tom Seaver play and a few trivial research interests.It is sad to think that this book may have been the book of it's time."
3,"I love it, but...","Now, I am an avid Play Arts collector. I love Play Arts figurines, and I am very careful with each and every one of them. Axel in particular was one figure I was very excited to get. His details were game accurate and very finely detailed. I was thrilled...until I tried to change his hands out so he could hold his chakrams. Axel is perhaps the most fragile Play Arts figurine in existence, as when I merely lightly tugged on the hand, the plastic ripped clean off and the nubs are now stuck in his wrists, leaving his hands unchangeable. I have had no problems like this with any of my other Play Arts figurines in the past. Even so, I am vastly disappointed with how fragile Axel is in comparisson to other products in the Play Arts lineup."
2,Looks ugly and cheap,"I know a fake plant won't look as nice as a real one, however, I find this one is just too tacky looking to be used (returning to Amazon).I found the picture to be quite misleading for the one I purchased as it looks 10x better than it does in person."
4,Great piece of plant decor,I love using suction cup plants because they are easily removed and cleaned. Sturdy for my arboreal geckos to lie on.
5,looks nice,its a fake plant for terrariums it looks nice snake seems to like it Id recommend it for any animal that lives in a terrarium.
5,Pretty!,They look really nice and blend really well in the tank. My turtles absolutely love it! looks good in a 10 gallon tank as well
3,This was to big for my tank,This was really way to big for my fish tank I was so excited when I got it but then it was way to big. I recommend having a really big tank when ordering this.
1,its ugly,"Seriously, this fake plant looks so obviously fake. Its also very ugly. It certainly doesn't look anything like the photo provided."
1,Medium sized plant not received.,I ordered two large and two medium. I believe this is the one I never received and got a refune. The other two I received and am very pleased with those two. Barb
4,Very comprehensive collection,"I have not heard the more recently released American compilation of The Archies, but this one sounds pretty good, especially on the more major tracks. Lesser-known songs are sometimes tinny and could be richer, but overall it's a perfectly decent listening experience. The selection of tracks here is hard to beat, offering many not available elsewhere. A few of them are admittedly pretty dumb, but overall the Archies are a fun bubblegummy pop band. I'm glad I own this."
1,Bitter Sugar Sugar,"I was quite disappointed when I listened to the song I had just purchased. It sounded more like the opening for a Saturday morning cartoon and was not the song that I love, ""Sugar, Sugar""."
5,"""Sugar, Sugar"" as Sweet as Ever","1999 marks the 30th anniversary of the ""feel good"" pop favorite ""Sugar, Sugar"" (actually 31st anniversary, as the album it was on, ""Everything's Archie,"" was released in 1968.) It's nice to see this song is still popular, and this release by 32 Records is a nice tribute to it. Released on a heart shaped CD, the listener wonders as he opens the package if this CD curiousity is really gonna work! But it works just fine, and the sound quality of the song is ""Great,"" nice and bright without any pops, hisses, or sound distortion that is found on some of the ""budget"" Archies CD compilations. The only flaw I find with it is that it is a BIG CD, with a BIG price for just ONE little song. C'mon guys... you could have at least stuck Sugar, Sugar's flip side, ""Melody Hill"" on there. Oh well... Overall, a nice sounding collector's item for both Archies and Music enthusiasts."
2,"a poorly mastered, but thorough, collection","All of the Archies songs I wanted to hear are here, but the mastering is varied and, at times, terrible. Some of these songs were obviously transferred from incredibly worn vinyl.I purchased this disc (as opposed to the relatively new collection on Uni/Fuel) based on one of the previous reviews. I haven't heard the Uni/Fuel collection so I don't know whether the sound quality is better, but this disc doesn't deliver the quality I expected. If you have Archies on vinyl already, you could make your own cd and it would probably sound just as good."
3,Great for a beginner...,"For a beginner, this book would be fantastic. If you've Managed for a season, though, all this book will do is confirm that you're doing the right thing (or not). Well written, and easy to understand, but elementary subjects."
4,Gather Together in my name,"There's no question why children all over the world are advised to read this book. This is the second of Maya Angelou's books that I have read, and I really enjoyed it. It's truthful and honest, but frankly, some parts of the book disgusted me. But, although I don't agree with some of the author's choices, this book is a good read. However, because of some of the content, I would only recommended it to a mature reader. If you want to read a book which doens't hide the fact that everyone makes mistakes, give this one a try."
5,My desire to understand my prejudice kept me ready Maya,This book was a real eye opener for me as a white woman. I read of her stuggles in a white dominated world and found myself cheering her on. It suprised me. The issues were balck/white and I was cheering for her team.Her strength of character and her boldness in adversity made me proud to be a woman. She tells it as only she can.
3,"Not quite what it says, but interesting","It's unfortunate the author didn't choose a better title. You'd probably expect THE Luthiers Handbook to be a how-to, but it's nothing like that. Actually it reads more like a college-level textbook. Engineering/techies will probably love it, as will anyone seriously interested in the how & why of fine instrument architecture. There's a lot in here about the tonal properties of various woods, bracings, etc. Even if you never figure out the author's 'tuning' method (or don't have your own home physics lab) you still might find yourself tapping on soundboards and thinking about such things. For the beginning luthier sticking to the tried and true, it's not essential reading however."
5,Great Book!,"This is an excellent book for an expert or a novice. It is easy to read...is very insightful about what makes your guitar sound the way it does, and will give you many ideas about how to customize the sound in your own projects."
4,Good Book For The Beginning Luthier,"Good book for the beginning luthier. The author gives some insight on the mental aspects of crafting a musical instrument. It is almost like talking about being ""one with the instrument."" He also gives some information on woods and techniques of an instrument builder."
1,Ugh.,"I usually love Nine West stuff, usually the only shoes that fit without an ""adjustment period"" of pain.And it's not that these hurt. They're just so hugely...UGLY. Maybe it's because I'm a size 10, but the super long, pointy toes just look like they should curl up and I can get work as a court jester.I've had pointy toed pumps before, and none of them quite made my feet look like gunboats.I'd recommend these if you've got a very small foot. Unless you're trying out for the circus, if you're a size nine or more...there are prettier shoes that won't make you be embarrassed at your Jackie O-sized tootsies."
4,for Syracuse in 1959-61,"Freeman studied the leadership in community groups in Syracuse, New York, from 1959-61. Despite the intervening years, the book might still be germane for those interested in the sociodynamics of volunteer organisations, especially in an American context. The book goes into the interplay between organisations and the city government, including various boards appointed by the city. The organisations were mainstream, often involved in activities like an arts museum.Half the book is the appendix, laying out details of how the study was conducted."
5,Satisfied...,I was able to purchase this product at a cheaper price than other sites were offering and I recieved this product on time according to the shipping estimate that was given. I am satisfied with this particular shopping experience.
5,Great Feel,"Since this is a real professional ball, and not a kid's ball, I like the way I feel when holding it. I enjoy my football games more when I am gripping this ball and passing it around to my buddies."
3,EXPENSIVE! Save your money!,"Decent enough ball, especially if you want to be throwing around what the pro's throw around; but for the price, it's just not worth it. Get a composite ball...I say the same to anyone who's gonna buy an official NBA basketball...the composite ball is just better. Save your money and go buy a composite ball. It'll be more grippy and will likely last longer. The real pro-ball hardens over time and hurts the hands to catch after a while."
3,Why does it stain the hands,I had purchased this item before and returned it because it stains the hands red when it gets wet. I bought another one liked the look and feel of it but like the other one I purchased it did the same thing. It really sucks cause I enjoy the feel and look of this ball better than a composite ball. Tight spiral every throw. Just wish it didn't stain my hands when it get's wet. I see the professionals use these in games in wet conditions and never see there hands get stained. Wonder why this happens with amazon balls. Great prompt service as always arrived a day early and love to play with something the pros do. Slightly disappointed.
4,Great way to end the show,"Season 4 of Prison Break was absolutley amazing. One of the best shows ever. The season had an incredible storyline of the team had to come together for one last time to clear their names. A couple spots here and there did get slow nearing the end of the season, but it was all worth it for the last episode. It may seem like the ending was a little rushed, but unfortunatly the show was cancelled but they were able to put on the best series finale possible. And on July 21st the true series finale will be coming out on DVD called Prison Break the final break. i will be buying Season 4 of Prison Break without a doubt"
4,love this show---sad its over.,"i've been watching this from the beginning and its so sad to see it over but it was coming. The only reason i'll be buying the dvd is so I can see the two extra episodes. I mean them just showing Michael's cemetary plot is just insane especially since i thought lincoln wouldn't make it to the end. I'm not the only who watched it to see michael and sara end up together with their child then four years later and no more michael. I'm just hoping these two straight to dvd episodes can show me more than the finale on tv. It left off in a weird place for me, i've never like shows that jump ahead more than a year and leave so much out."
3,A good call to end this show...,"Prison Break season 1 was superb, probably the best ever TV series out there. Season 2 still rocks and Season 3 was getting a bit boring. The original concept of this series is to show how a group of ppl managed to get out of prison cell, expertly! But for season 4, i felt that this series has really lost its way, from prison all the way to Sylla? It is now way totally out from the original story in my opinion, so i guess it's really a good time to take this show off air in season 4. I continue to watch this show in season 4 because i have already watched season 1-3 and i really need to know how it ends, otherwise, i wouldn't bother watching this anymore."
1,Very weak....,"I was shocked. Didn`t even finish it.It was mind-blowingly shallow and infantile.Only FOX could ruin something as great as the original PB.Never in TV history have I witnessed a descent like thisfrom excellence with Season One to foolishness in Season Four.Only watch season one and forget they ever made 2,3 & especially 4"
1,Prison Break 4,"I can't understand why Fox did the season four without Spanish subtitles for the hispanic public.Are they jerks????A great bunch of hispanic peoples are FANS of Prison Break.I can't understand why they made this stupid mistake, moreover ... they include subtitles for the Final Break, YES in spanish.How Come?I mean unless a second production includes the spanish subtitles for me they are jerks.ariel"
1,Should have stopped at 3,"Ok, my opinion is that Prison Break season one is the best season of any TV show of all time! I could not stop watching it!!! Buy season 1! Season 2 was only entertaining to me because I was already attached the the characters. Season 3 was a little better than season 2, but season 4 should have never happened. This season makes the first 3 seasons seem pointless! As a true Prison Break fan, I recommend seasons 1-3 in that order. This season was a sorry excuse to drag the series into a last ditch effort for more money. FLOP!!!"
1,should have been a miniseries,"it was an amazing first season , but not even half way through the second season it turned into a laughable show. i cant believe it lasted 4 seasoni should have been a mini series with a 2 hour movie finale. but they milked the story way way too much. i would advise everyone to just watch season 1 and imagine thats how the series ended. cause the creativity sure did"
1,"Terrible, Horrible,... there are no words","I like a lot season 1 of PB, it was interesting, well-written and exciting, season 2 was a little worse but still good, season 3 was a lot worse, it was simply very bad, and this season 4 it is so bad, that I don't find any words to describe it.Don't buy it, It is a good advice I give you, watching an entire episode of season 4 PB is really hard but watching the whole season can be a torture."
4,"Still good, but not as great as seasons 1 and 2.","I'm late to the party and just watched all 4 seasons for the first time this past month. I loved seasons 1 and 2 and couldn't quit watching, but season 3 and 4 were not as well done. They felt too hurried and not as smart or thought out. Still had to finish the series though since it kept me interested enough in what happens to the characters."
5,Love it,"I don't really watch television, but this tv series had me hooked and I couldn't wait to find out what happened next after every episode"
4,Great Show,"Terrific show but it had to end - the events depicted were growing increasingly more improbable and while I enjoyed the exotic locales, tension, and dramatic escapes the show simply couldn't continue because the events were just too implausible."
5,Excellent series,Lots of suspense and action keep you on your toes and make you hope for many more. You cannot wait for the next episode
2,The creative energy of Season 1 is gone,"Season 1 was incredible. After that, the series went steadily downhill. I don't know whether they lost the original writers or they just got burned out. Season 4 is totally lacking in imagination. It has a small collection of plot elements constantly reshuffled with slight variations. Pretty soon you realize that anytime there is a scene where Character 1 gets the drop on Character 2, Character 3 will come up from behind and turn the tables by getting the drop on Character 1. Every one of the good guys will have a family member taken hostage by the bad guys. Any time a character appears to have been killed in one episode, there is a pretty good chance the next episode will reveal that they narrowly escaped. The predictability kills the suspense. And the director continues his annoying habit of trying to show tension by having the actors suddenly start gasping like they just ran a marathon. Disappointing."
3,3/4th of a great season,"Was loving this season till the last 5 or 6 episodes where they just kept doing the same beats over and over. Plus, the last scene makes it unlikely I'll revisit any of the ""Prison Break"" episodes ever again."
1,Please spanish subtitules,"I have seasons 1, 2 and 3 and I bought this season but I would like find one with spanish subtitules"
2,I can see why it was cancelled,"The first two seasons of this show were amazing, never dissapointed, and the characters were rich, motivated, and unique. Watching season 4 makes me want to watch season one and two again. These are not the same characters. The writing is hokey, and awful. There is no driving force, and too many hokey ""aha!"" suprise moments. The characters seem to be written wrong deliberately. T-Bag pronounces a word wrong, and is corrected (would never happen), Sucre has a man crush on Bellick, and Bellick is a smarmy good guy. No way. I know they had to hurry up and end it since they probably knew they were cancelled halfway through the season, but they really screwed it up. Just buy the first two seasons (possibly the third), and pretend like the end of that season is the end of the show. You will be happier."
4,"At first I did not like it much but now, I love it!","I got the other three season in hard core packs that looked very nice. Although I liked those that way, I found this cover very easy to handle and it also looks nice, smaller but cds-protective. The contents are just what I was expecting them to be and this series is awesome!"
5,Excellent,"If you llike PRISON BREAK, Season 4 is super good - you got to buy it - no excuse !It's simple, everything single episode story is excellent as well as the actors.I don't want to reveal anything, so just click on ""buy it now"".your friend."
5,Spectacular!!!,Prison Break is by far the best TV Series I have ever seen in my life. It is beyond what you think could ever happen. Eric & Rachael give it 2 thumbs up!
2,What happen to the Close Caption?,"I Absolutely Love Season 1, 2, 3 but when it came to season 4, i couldn't understand what they are saying most of the time. What happen to the Close Caption? They had it for the other seasons, but not for Season 4. I love the show, but it sucks not knowing what everyone is saying since i am hard of hearing and even though, i turn up the tv, it helps somewhat, but not fully. I was so very disappointed, most of the time, i am just fast forwarding."
2,What a disappointment!,"I can't figure out why some reviewers can't make a difference between season 4 and the 3 previous ones... Frankly, all i found here was a poor scenario with predictable hooks and mellow love scenes. As a previous reviewer stated, stop at season 3 and u'll be fine!"
4,I love this series...,I love this series but the ending was really bad. Seemed like the writers were just tired and didn't try too hard.
4,Loved it!,I can't get enough of Prison Break. I wish the series was still on. Lots of excitement and drama. It's worth watching.
1,Why Any Subtitles?,Come on! I can't belive that Fox do that!!!Latin Market is a great market!This is the First time they do that! You make it with the wrong series!
3,disappointed,"Hi,i'm french and prison break is a great serie, but i'm disappointed by the dvd : no subtitles at all (either spanish or french) . Fortunately, I understand english but i prefer with subtitles. And what about the hearig-impaired ?"
3,Hope it was all worth it,"Im happy to see that the box set for season 4 will not take forever to get into stores, but I sure hope that the ending to the series wil be better than what they passed off as an ending to the Sopranos series, I hope I didnt dedicate the last 4 yrs to Prison break to be let down by a BOGUS ending"
2,not in stock,The product was not in stock. So I was charged then reimbursed on my credit card. I lost money in the transaction due to the variation of currancy rate (Euro to Dollar). It was very little money but it is unpleasant to notice it.
2,So So movie,"I rented this one expecting alot since it had all the film festival labels on the cover. But once again ,that doesn't mean anything these days. The story was somewhat interesting but fell short half way through. The one thing I can say is that there is an awsome fable that is told in the beginning of some scenes ,giving a continuity with the movie I guess. That story was awsome. That fable is worth checking this movie out. But that's about it."
2,too stretchy and rough feeling,"I was not impressed with this Jockey product--a big surprise. I generally buy Jockey because they have quality products. These pantyhose are unpleasantly rough to the touch, and do not have enough elasticity. They tend to pool around my ankles after a couple of hours, and bag at the knees. Ick."
2,disappointment,"received the book right on time and it certainly is informational as a dictionary. I did however find it to be written on rather coarse paper, the inexpensive binding put together in very loosely and ill-fitting manner.....I am surprised that this book was so costly as it was presented this way, and I certainly hope it will hold up well in all its use."
5,Another great release by Social D!,This release shows that you can grow as a person and a musician without losing your edge. This is another great CD and I highly recommend it. I'm just disappointed that I can't make the show when they come to Chicago.
5,Social D's Part II to White Heat,"First off, I love this CD. If you dont have White Heat, White Light, White Trash get it too. White is all about feeling down and abused. This CD is about redemption. I guess Mike Ness found someone to love. It still has all the edginess of past CDs but with more melodies. They added a keyboard. The tribute to Social D's passed away member, ""Dont Take Me for Granted"" is every guy's over 45 personal anthem. The lyrics on Winners and Losers are just incredible. If there were no music, just listening to the words would still make this CD worth it."
4,Well Worth the Wait!,I've been a huge Social D fan since the Mommy's Little Monster on LP days. I was hugely disappointed in White Light... I was expecting another lackluster performance like that of White Light. What a pleasant surprise. This is almost as good as Somewhere Between Heaven and Hell! The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is the album length. I would have wanted 4 or 5 more songs with the long wait but it is great nonetheless! Buy this CD!!!
5,"The best album to come out in a long, long time!","This album is amazing! I just can't stop listening to it. Just as wines get better with age, so does Social Distortion. This is in the vein of White Heat, but takes a huge step up! Mike's lyrics are even a little different, almost as if he's trying to tell us that there comes a time to grow up. But don't get me wrong, you won't see ol' Mikey lay down his guitar, toss out the beers, and cover his tats. He just shows maturity. Like Ness says on the 'Live in Orange County' dvd: ""Even tough guys fall in love."" Here is a tough guy who fell in love. He may have a big heart, but he's still got that switchblade in his boot. He ain't gonna change for anyone, but he will enjoy life while he's here. Words alone can bring this album no justice. You have to hear it. You have to feel it inside to understand what i mean. I always hate the ""if you only buy one album this year..."" spill, but I have to say this one cannnot be passed up!"
3,Mike Ness needs to give it up!!!,"I really liked Social D. at one time in my life until I recently seen them live a few weeks ago. I thought Mike Ness was nothing more than boring and down right ignorant. The rest of the band was good, but when the bands frontman can't do much, but say ""this next song is about or is."". Give me a break. Mike Ness kept bashing people in Hollywood and politics. He seemed really immature and pointless. I think he really tried to be a tough guy that night. I seen Agnostic Front about a year ago and the frontman Roger Miret is straight up a tough guy just looking at him, but he didn't have to make a seen of himself. Actually he was really kewl with the crowd and appreiciated everyone unlike Mike Ness's fake a.. . Plain and simple Mike Ness is a fake, but maybe back in the day he wasn't until he became stuck on himself. Oh yeah, Roger Miret has more and even cooler tatts."
1,Sad,"I've been a fan of Social D for many, many years. They have consistently been one of the best live acts I've seen, and I've probably seen them 25 times. Unfortunately during their last concert at Avalon in Hollywood, not only did their new material not measure up but I had to listen to Mike Ness' political commentary. I'll never ask President Bush to sing, and I am not interested in having someone with a high school education and no understanding of economics or foreign policy impart his ignorant viewpoint when I'm paying to be entertained. To all ""politically minded"" musicians: ""SHUT UP AND SING!"""
1,They should have given up years ago!,"Social Distortion is, was and always will be great in concert, but the music on this album does not reflect that at all. It is nothing but rewritten old songs from past albums, and they are not as good. Mike Ness is a genius, so why does he put out such horrible music for his fans to waste thier money on."
5,Wow.,"Really this album is one of my fav. Being the owner of around 800 punk cds this is by far outplayed. Their sound is just amazing and their lyrics have really matured. Youll have all your kids who dont like it cause its a little soft but man, what a sound. The guitars are awesome and the lyrics blow my mind. Thanks Social D for being who you are."
5,Amazing,"I have been listening to Social D since the 80s and I have always been impressed with their ability to maintain their own style while constantly tinkering with their sound. From the pure punk roots, to the country/rockabilly sound, and into pure wall of noise rock, Mike Ness and crew have always stood out as one of the all time great bands and probably my personal favorite (along with the Cramps.) Sex, Love and Rock and Roll, rumored to be their last album stands out as a strong, solid, and mature work. The hards edges in the music has softened, but the vocals make up for that. Mike Ness has again opened up his heart and soul and made an album which truly distills what it means to grow from young street punk to an older and wiser performer. I hope this is not the last album from Social D, but if it is, I can accept this as being their final work. If your a Social D fan, buy this album."
5,Buy it !!!,It is amazing no one knows about this band. Maybe that's a good thing. This CD Rocks!I saw them live earlier this year and was blown away!! I'm 45 years old and it was good to see people my age plus a new generation of rockers who love punk / rock music.
1,Looking for a good Brit composer ?,"Well, look elsewhere !!! This guy is so bad, so mundane, so whizzbang --- that he even makes Lloyd George look ok ...........and the latter is the elevater music of classical"
4,Pancho,"I have read other books by Blake and have never been disappointed. This is good, but not one of his best. Still worth a look."
4,You better enjoy ballads...,"If you like Dan Hill's typical mellow, bordering-on-cheesy, ballads, then this is a good album for you. Hill is known for his love-themed, practically-cheesy, mellow ballads, and this album is full of them. His popular tracks, ""Sometimes When We Touch"" and ""Can't We Try"", are on this compilation, along with several other ballads. Although his duets are recorded with Ricque Franks, who isn't the original duet partner, the songs still sound fairly comparable to the originals. ""In Your Eyes"" is another nice ballad with his typical love-theme, but slightly different than his other hits. There are about six nice ballads in this compilation, but I just about skipped through his non-ballads. Some artists are strictly balladeers and Dan Hill is about as ""balladeer"" as you can get. Dan Hill's music is somewhere between Barry Manilow and Joe Cocker, so if you're into the mellow/raspy voice ballads, you definitely will enjoy this one."
1,1 because there's no zero,"I wonder how many people have a song that by the 2nd time they hear it, they can't change the station on the radio fast enough. ""Sometimes When We Touch"" is that song for me."
5,It's a wonderful life,Love this movie! We don't get tv and this is a must see over the holidays for me. So thankful I got to see it.
4,Favorite Movie - good version,"This is an all time favorite movie for me (and many others), and even though it's on TV every holiday season, I'm glad to finally own it for myself. I think NBC holds exclusive rights to the movie and therefore only airs it a couple times a year at it's own discretion. Even more reason to own a copy. This version includes classic B&W; version as well as a color disc. To be honest, my family and I initially agreed that it's borderline blasphemy to watch the color version over the original ... however, we were all also curious enough as to what the color version looks like that I'm sure we'll watch it eventually. Maybe next Christmas.No complaints about packaging or delivery. Solid Amazon purchase as usual."
5,Classic!,It is nice to own a copy of this classic movie without being forced to watch it in black & white. The colored version is very vivid and helps to bring out a lot of detail that is missed in the original version.
5,One of the great movies!,This is one of our favorite Christmas films. I ordered this because our old copy finally bit the dust and I needed a quick replacement. The price was a bit of a premium but I was desperate.
5,Color is amazing,"I loved this edition which contains both the black and white version and the new colorized one too. I'm usually not a fan of colorization, but they did a superb job of making the colors look true to that era. I really loved this set and would recommend it to anyone wanting to buy a great edition of this movie."
5,Thank you Mr. Capra!,"The first time I saw this film was in 1982 at a very low point in my life. It had just started showing on the TV when I turned it on. In fact I was sitting in an empty apartment with the only furniture being a black and white TV (my roomate moved and stole everything while I was out.)By the end of this story I was completely moved, a changed person. That was the best Christmas I have ever had, though I was homeless and pennyless I discovered something eternal that guided me onward. I will always cherish that experience. Christmas isn't tinsel and wrapped gifts or shopping malls and parties. Thank you Mr. Capra for capturing the true meaning of Christmas. If you've never seen this movie you will be wonderfully suprised."
5,Love the Color,"After watching this movie at least once a year for nearly 30 years in black and white, this was a real treat to see it in color. I loved it. They did a great job on the colorization. If you love this movie you will love it even more in color."
5,Great Product !,"I bought this 2-disk set for my mom as a Christmas present. She loved it. The picture and sound were great, and she loved having both B&W and color versions. Great buy."
2,It's a crappy movie,"The character wished poorly.Instead of wishing he'd never been born, how about wishing he'd got all the things he wanted? Instead of being stuck in a second rate savings and loan with a partner too senile or stupid to hold onto $8000, he might have been a bank president in a big city.Instead of tearing his guts out helping ingrates, he could have been helping himself to a glass of properly aged scotch, given to him by someone in the banking industry who appreciated his abilities.And what about Potter? If he'd gone to jail, I might have said the movie had a happy ending.Potter had hopes and dreams, too, how would dullsville have changed into Potterville just by removing the Jimmy Stewart character?"
1,It's a Wonderful Live,"This is an extremely poor movie. It is a shameless enterprise in sentimentality, constantly bordering on bathos. Typical of many American films both of that period and contemporary times. Very boring to boot.It gets all its mileage out of holiday sentiments, and the hazy glow of the holidays colors too many people's view of the film."
4,Yet another release,"This is a great DVD if you don't already own this. What is nice is that the color version of the movie is made available to own for the first time on DVD. I hope the next release of the movie has a ""Real Documentary"" on the making & marketing if the movie. ALso how the movie became public domaine and then somehow was reclaimed by the studio."
5,It's a Wonderful Life,This is our favorite Christmas movie. We wanted to get it on DVD for the clearer picture quality and we're very satisfied. It's a wonderfully encouraging story. We bought it for some friends of ours who are going through difficult times and questioning why. It was an encouragement to them.
5,Just Love It!,"I finally have my own original copy. I feel everyone should have this movie ""It's a Wonderful Life"" in their library. Certainly make you see what's the important thing in life."
5,It's A Wonderful Life in color,This is a great make over in color. My wife & I lovede it even more than the balck & white. You have to watch them both.
5,The 1995 DVD release's picture quality is the same as this one,I own both and the 1995 DVD's picture & sound quality are the same. They just repacked the movie with 60th anniversary banner. There is no difference. So if you don't have the 1995 DVD release this is a good item for you because they did a good job in 1995 and saved themselves money not having to retouch it up in 2006!
5,Can't Beat It...,"This film is a classic, no doubt, and my ALL TIME FAVORITE MOVIE ever.As for the DVD version, doesn't get any better than this. The movie quality itself if better than any of my VHS Tape versions by a long shot, the addtional information about the film, actors, etc. is AWESOME!I love the movie and now I have a verison of it that brings it all back to me."
4,Enjoying!,"I really was pleased with the product except the box was crushed and to me the box was part of the package and had a picture of a Christmas tree. Otherwise, everything was fine and I am enjoying the movie and the bell."
4,Required at Christmas,"This is the sappiest of all Christmas movies and is not to be missed. Every one should see this movie if not for the lesson that underlies the story, then for the story itself. The good guys, the bad guy, the beautiful girl, the naughty girl, and an angel. How can you pass this up? Just plain makes you feel good, and all good people should see it."
5,Best Movie,Wonderful to be able to watch this movie through amazon. Thank you!Please be Pro-life and not support Planned Parenthood or Gay Marriage. Amazon should not support this.
5,It's a wonderful life,We have the VCR and wanted the DVD for more background information - just lovely.
5,Beautiful!,Was craving this movie over Christmas and was so happy to find it on Amazon! The resolution was great and the movie was even more beautiful than I remembered it!
3,Aspect Ratio,"I love this movie and we watch it every holiday season a couple of times over. The only reason I give this three stars is because it's still in 1.33:1 (4:3) aspect ratio. With all the other older movies being released in 1.78:1 (16:9) blu-ray, why isn't this one?"
2,Traditional Holiday Movie,"Stewart gives an excellent performance to an otherwise silly tale. Non-sensical, best left for children; I did enjoy this each holiday season when I was a child."
1,Is this a copy or an original ?,"This won't play on my DVD player.I get the following mesage on my screen.""this player is incompatible with the region marking of this disc""They also promised is by the 24th of November and I received it on the 26th, the day after Thanksgiving. I am Verrrry disappointed.I will be returning it."
3,very lightly colored :(,"Unfortunately, the coloring is so lightly done that it does not look like a color version, but almost like sepia and pastel at times."
1,Broken,I was looking forward to watching this holiday classic as it has been years since I have seen it. I made it half way through before the disc refused to play any longer.
3,It's A wonderful Life,I thought the movie was going to be colorized since it's the 60th addition. Disappointed it was still in Black and White. Thought it was pricey for a black and white film. I own the VHS and think it's better.
5,When You are Down and Out,"This is a classic film without a doubt. When you are down and out put this film in and really see what it has to say. When your back is against the wall and it seems hopeless there is still a ray of hope. Someone somewhere does care. You have made a difference throughout your life and you don't realize it. You made a difference to the ones you loved and loved you. You made a difference no matter how insignificant to many you have made contact with. Perhaps is worth living after all. You may have more to offer than you ever knew. You will be missed. You never know what's around the bend of life. Stewart conveys the torment and despair of hopelessness brilliantly. Yet, he perseveres. My heart goes out to him in this film. He just seems so sincere. Mister Capra, there is no corn here, just heart. Thank you so much for this film."
5,Without a doubt the best christmas film ever!!,"The best christmas film ever, I can watch it every year and not get tired of it. Waht would christmas be with It's a wonderful life? The film has a great story baout a man who wants to commit suicide on christmas eve and is visited by his guarding angel before he tries to kill himeself, then he wishes he was never born and see's what life would be like if he wasent born. The film has a great messege that everyone makes a diffrence in life. The acting is great espesially from Jimmy Stuert and Donna Reid and the actor who patraes Clarence is a scene steller. The film should of won best picture and shound of won best actor and actrerss and director. It's weird when it was relesed the film was a box office bomb but got more popluler over the years. The film is on many critics list's of best films ever. It's a wonderfull ilfe is one of my top 5 movies of all time and I watch it every christmas and is the best christmas film ever."
3,A little disappointed,"I was somewhat disappointed with the quality of this Blu-ray ""It's a Wonderful Life"". To me, it wasn't any better than the regular DVD version."
5,One of three we watch every year!,Our family watches this movie every year on Christmas. The HD version available on Amazon is of fantastic quality. A must see!!
5,No man is a failure,They will be playing this film a thousand years from now. It's message is timeless and because of alifting on rights can be played over and over again on television. This is by far one of the best films ever made.
5,Wonderful Life Lesson,"Even though some years it is overly shown on TV I still love this movie and never tire of it. I think what makes it one of my favorites is that it tells much more than a Christmas story. It tells us that no matter what we do, we matter. We touch so many peoples lifes during our lifetime that like a butterfly flitting across a blue sky in Illinois may lead to the wind a Sailing ship needs in the Sea of Japan. Well a little overstated maybe but we do in fact cause ripples in the fabric of our civilization. We all may never impact so many as George Bailey does, but we certainly can make a difference even if it is just one we touch. Anyone no matter what age should enjoy this movie."
5,Reflections on Ones Life,"If you have never seen this movie, watch it and put yourself in George Bailey's situation. This movie is a great way to look at your own life and judge what have YOU contributed to society. I have watched this movie dozens of times over the years and a video copy was given to me as a present from a very good friend of mine. Anytime I start to feel sorry for myself or think I got a bad turn, think of what the world may be without you, all the people you may have given directions to, helped someone cross a street, gave to a charity (if you never did this things than there is no sense to the movie). Each movie does not have to be a Cecil B DeMille do be worth something, hopefully by watching this movie you will look at your life in a different way. There are several worthwhile messages in the movie and it is a good way to spend an evening with your family/children. Everyone can't be monetarily rich but when you have many friends for many years you are truly richest man in town."
5,"""It's A Wonderful Life""","The DVD, ""It's A Wonderful Life"" is fantastic, I watch it at least 3 times a week during the time between Thanksgiving and Christmas every year, it never gets old, I bought this one this for a friend for Christmas as she only had a copy which she recorded off of the TV about 10 years ago, she was absolutely thrilled.W"
5,Excellent Quality,Excellent Quality B&W version. Best I've seen yet. Was very pleased with the video quality compared to other attempts I've seen. Not much else to say about the story; it's a classic after all.
3,NOT the colorized,"Of course the movie is 5 star!!! But one reviewer said this is colorized, and it is NOT, just FYI"
5,Great Movie,Just an absolutely great and wonderful movie to watch any time of the year. The color version in the 2 disk collector's set is remarkably good.( looks as good as Blu-Ray ) I couldn't be happier with my purchase.
5,Gift for Dad,My dad has an old VHS he takes out from time to time and the quality is pretty terrible. I found this and got it for him and he loves it very much. Thanks much!
5,Great Christmas classic,"Great Christmas classic, always enjoy watching, must have for home to watch over and over."
5,Wonderful Christmas Classic,Christmas is not the same without this movie. It's a wonderful movie to watch w/the whole family and reflect what really matters in life. I still cry at the end even though I've seen it so many times. It's definately a Christmas classic.
2,The story is beyond reproach...,"However, despite this being ""HD"" it is 4:3 formatted and that just doesn't translate well to a 16:9 HD TV."
5,If you haven't seen this yet.. What are you waiting for ?,"You have to watch this movie !!! I watch it every Christmas without fail .One of the best Christmas movies ever made. It makes you appreciate life when you watch it ,you'll never forget ZuZus pedals.Highly reccomended.!!!!!!!"
5,Classic,"This movie has everything you want in a movie. It is a fantastic classic! No Kardashians, no hip music & whatnot. The film has everything you want in a movie."
5,Black & White & Color..who could ask for more!!!,My husband has been asking for this movie FOREVER! The kids just did't take the hint so i bought it for him and it is wonderful!He is a HAPPY CAMPER!
5,A True Classic,"With remakes, new ideas, and new stars, there is a tendency to try and overshadow the originals which made these classics great in the first place. This movie, (like Miracle on 34th Street) gets greater every year. What would Christmas be without it? I have seen this movie at least 20 times and I am still not tired of it. It is a must for every video library."
5,A wonderful thing to have,"I am thrilled to own my own copy of the timeless classic ""It's a Wonderful Life."" One really doesn't have to wait until it is Christmas time to not only view a great movie, but also to ponder the contribution each of us makes to the environments in which we live and work."
5,It's a Wonderful Life is Just Wonderful,"How good is it? Well, as much as it is played during the holidays, I still had to have a copy of it. Take it from me an avid movie buff. You have to have a copy of this movie in your collection. Bring back the faith in your fellow man."
5,It's a onderful Life,"This was the first movie I ordered. I have watched this movie for many, many, many years, so I thought I might as well buy it. The price was a little high I thought. But when you like and want something, one will pay the price."
5,The Movie Comes To Life With DVD,"I've seen this movie numerous times on tape and TV broadcasts. However, the quality of the DVD transfer really made a difference.The movie takes on a three dimensional quality and deepened my appreciation for the work that went into the film.A ""must have"" for those who love the classics!"
2,Colorized Version Stinks!!!!!!,"The colorized version of this timeless holoday classic is a complete desecration of the original black and white presentation. The garish washed out colors (done in 1988 by Colorization Inc.), destroys the shadow and picture contrasts and kills the entire mood and tone of the film.Go with the original black and white version. You will enjoy the pathos of George Bailey (Jimmy Stewart), who attempts to commit suicide after a financial breakdown but is stopped by his guardian angel who shows him the importance of his life...This is a true holiday classic that is strictly meant to be seen in B&W;!!!!!!!"
3,Not the Republic Pictures Colorized version...,"I just received this DVD from Amazon and was looking forward to the Colorized version from Republic Pictures. I saw the colorized version on Lifetime Network several years ago (the Republic Pictures version) and it was very well done. The previous version out of video was poor. So, when seeing the description as color, and noting it's a Republic Pictures print, I thought it was FINALLY being released on DVD. Disappointed and returning to Amazon...."
2,Busted bell,"I was very excited about getting this movie, and the only reason I got the more expensive one was because I wanted the ornament for our tree. well to my disappointment, the ornament was busted. Completely pushed in one side. The package was intact, so I know it didn't happen in the shipping. The ornament was displayed in a clear front of the box, and you can clearly see it was busted. Which only makes me wonder what kind of person sends something when they can clearly see it's broken."
1,VERY washed out,"I love this movie and downloaded it so I could watch it on my laptop. I also downloaded Amazon unbox to watch it on. I was extremely disapointed that the majority of the movie is very washed out, so much that I cannot make out any details or even see people's faces. For $9.99 I expected a lot more. The audio was fine, but to not be able to SEE the movie in detail is a big deal to me.I also don't like that all of the reviews for this are mixed, so it's impossible for me to see which reviews are for the ""instant watch"" version as opposed to the DVD or Blu Ray versions."
5,Christmas Classic,"After having seen this for the 20th or so time I wish they had edited down the ""backstory"". Still delivers the message that we are what we do for others and not for what we gather for ourselves- which is what Christ's earthly ministry was all about."
4,Film noir becomes family fare!,"This movie never interested me until I started watching once in the middle of it: the scene where Stewart storms away from Ma Bailey's Boarding House & stares into the camera is spine tingling! So is the scene where he lunges after Donna Reed! It's real film noir as family fare! By the way, to see what actors mean by range, compare Lionel Barrymore's curmudgeonly Mr. Potter in this movie with his Key Largo role a year later as the grieving Mr. Temple."
5,An american classic,I had bought this movie more then once when this version came out. However I had to have it. I was not disapointed...I was so happy to have it in it's color version that the fact that the video has the orginal extra's didn't matter. I love this movie and anyone else that does should buy this just for the color version. It brings a new addition to your lives.
2,get the DVD,I got this one because I didn't know about the latest 2disc DVD release with B/W and color remastered versions. I was interested in this release because the colorized version was the only remastered version I knew of. Lighting in all the other B/W releases is NOTHING like the originals due to several decades of VAULT DECAY. Remastering is required to see anything close to what the directors/editors originally produced 50 years ago.
5,It's a Wonderful Life,Only wish there were more of these type of family value Christmas movies made today. This trully is a classic loved by anyone that waches it.
5,Husbands Fav,"Got this for my husband, he can now keep it on our amazon digital to watch at any time. It saves us waiting for the one time a year they play the movie."
5,It's a Wonderful Life,"This movie has been a favorite in my family for years, and just thought I'd like to own a copy for myself. I'm glad I purchased it. I've always loved the message of this movie. It's great for anyone of any age. I would recommend it to everyone. But then, who hasn't seen it??? :)"
4,A Story for the Ages,"This is a Wonderful Movie, one that I had not seen prior to purchasing this Blue-Ray. The package comes with two discs, one in the original black and white, and the other a colorized version. I bought this because my son and I were doing this story for the local theatre group, and we wanted to get to know the characters better. I cannot believe I never wanted to watch this movie prior."
5,Class Project,"I had to analyze this film for one of my Sociology classes. I had watched this movie about a million times before but at some point in all those years I had stopped paying close attention to the details of it. I had forgotten how exceptionally brilliant this movie really is. It is worth putting everything else aside, for a little while, to watch."
3,2 disc - one good & other not,Color version - nothing but skips & scratches -not 'playable'. B & W plays fine. Classic Christmas favorite! First time ordering online.
5,Wonderful,"This is my second favorite movie of all time. BUT....There was a glitch in the system that caused my Christmas eve viewing to be greatly disappointing as the Amazon video crash of 2012 made it unavailable from about 15 mins in until more than a day later which they tried to blame on Roku and was really their fault..I think Amazon should refund my purchase price and give me the movie for free. I've watched this particular movie every xmas eve for forty years and this 'crash"" is totally unaceptable."
5,Beautiful in color!,"I've probably seen this movie a dozen times in b&w and love it, but to see it in full, natural looking color is really amazing! Makes this classic even better."
4,Great Service,Great Service and gave as a Christmas gift .. bought 2 of them.!! Arrived just in time for me to give as a gift.
5,It's a Wonderful Film,"This is, without any shadow of a doubt, one of the best films ever made.George Bailey (played by the wonderful Jimmy Stewart) is a depressed man who contemplating ending his life because he thinks he's worthless. Enter Clarance, a guardian angel despirate to earn his wings from God, who begins to show him differently. The story of how one persons life affects so many others is both inspiring and heartwarming. It really does make you think just what might have happened if you hadn't been in a certain place at a certain time. For the few of you out there who haven't seen it, I won't spoil the ending, save to say that it's as brilliant as the rest of the film. The film should have won every Oscar going but, sadly, it didn't. This film really is a true classic."
5,Perfection?,"This is one of my all-time favourite movies. James Stewart has to be actor of the century, nay the millennium. This film among others show how brilliant an actor he was. Forget the insincere stagy performances of Tom Hanks, sit down and watch an actor who makes you believe in the characters he played. Every moment, every performance in this film is a positive gem. No other film has moved me the way this film continues to move me. It has humour and pathos, all carefully and expertly mixed. Perhaps the closest thing to a perfect film?On the down side this DVD transfer is not perfect, there is noticeable pixelation in some scenes, especially where there are shadows - there is a noticeable shimmering in the background. Other than that its a fine print of a wonderful film."
5,one of the best classics,This movie is one of the best classics around. I recommend it all young and old. Jimmy Stewart and Donna Reed are great together.
5,It's a wonderful Movie!,"This is my favorite all time movie! I wish I was George Bailey and was able to help as many people. That being said, I own 6 copies of this movie on tape and DVD. This new colorized version is probably the best of the bunch but the colors are still a little off. My husband and I always watch this movie a few times before Christmas and have just started sharing it with our two young sons. They prefer the color version but you know kids, they have no appreciation for old black & white! They are amazed when we tell them about the television stations ending their broadcasting each night, TV antennas, having to change the channel by hand and not paying for TV!The black and white version is good too. I would recommend this movie to any die hard fans or folks looking for a wonderful movie, wonderfully restored!"
5,Excellent Christmas Movie Classic!,This is a classic to the entire Christmas movie collection that no one should be without! It brings back memories when my husband and I were children as well as now establishing traditions with our grandchildren! George and Mary Bailey display what not only what family is all about but the true meaning of Christmas as many get caught up in the commercialization of Christmas losing it's true meaning. Merry Christmas everyone! GMomma D
5,A holiday Classic,A feel good movie with a timeless lesson that is as important now as it was when the movie was made.
4,Good Price,Good price for a good Christmas movie. Our kids had never seen the movie and they enjoyed it as well.
3,a gift for a friend,"The set came in good time, but both discs were rattling around in the box, so I had to unseal it, which I didn't want to do, since it was a gift. Both discs had come loose from the case. They were visibly scratched, but the gift recipient said they still played all right. I was not happy giving it to her that way."
5,Classic,"It's A Wonderful Life (1946), originally made for Liberty Films, is one of the most popular and heartwarming films ever made by director Frank Capra. Frank Capra regarded this film as his own personal favorite - it was also James Stewart's favorite of all his feature films.It was actually a box-office flop at the time of its release, and only became the Christmas movie classic in the 1970s due to repeated television showings at Christmas-time when its copyright protection slipped and it fell into the public domain in 1974 and TV stations could air it for free. [Republic Pictures restored its copyright claim to the film in 1993, with exclusive video rights to it. Currently, it can be shown only on the NBC-TV network, and its distribution rights belong to Paramount Pictures.]"
4,Old Movie - New Tech,"You wouldn't think an old movie could benefit from Blu-Ray tech, but it does! Clear, sharp definition, blacker blacks, whiter whites!"
5,I am amazed at Amazon,"This is simply a feel good movie for me. I could not find it anywhere. But Amazon had it at a extremely reasonable price. It came with 2 disc's. One was colorized and the other was the original version in black and white. I am in love with it today as I was 20 years ago. Although I chose standard shipping, I received it in about 3 days. And it was unharmed! This certainly won't be the last time I purchase from Amazon."
1,Bad quality,"Very bad sound, stoped often and went blank. Just before the end it stoped and would NOT start agin,so we never finished it."
4,Center of the universe after all,"I enjoy this movie, though not as much as other Christmas stories. I enjoy Clarence the angel the most, but I find the multiple disappointments of George Bailey tedious. The whole thing smacks too much of teen angst--""they'll be sorry when I'm gone!"" Although people do have many disappointments in life, these are generally not crunched together in narrative form and thus tend to depress the person living through them---and in this case us---to a lesser extent. The next good fortune manages to mitigate the last bad luck event. The novel prospect of seeing the world without oneself is the most entertaining part of the film. The question for me has always been, would it really be all that different? I have the distinct feeling that it's all about feeling sorry for ourselves, then discovering we were actually the center of the universe after all!"
4,Wonderful Life,My wife loves this movie. It made a perfect stocking stuffer Christmas present that we'll watch for years to come.
5,Great Blu ray box set of this classic film,"This Blu ray set of the classic Jimmy Stewart/Donna Reed film is great. The Blu ray quality is excellent with deep blacks and clear separation of shades in between which is important for a black and white film.The packaging is nicely done and the silver bell ornament is a fun touch. Only thing while Amazon usually gets it right, they had to replace this as the first sets box was crushed a bit."
4,Best yet but somewhat lacking,Although it is in Blu-Ray... it is still not Blu-Ray quality because it is old. But they did a great job of cleaning up the video. Fantastic! But the audio is still mono. I watched the colorized version but it is in the 4:3 format so I will not give it five stars because of that. Other wise this is fantastic. But 4:3 stinks.
1,IT's NOT in COLOR,"I bought this as a birthday present for my mom because she used to have the It's A wonderful Life in color on VHS.I recored over this VHS about 5 years ago, and i have felt terrible ever since. AMazon said that this edition was in color, so i decided that this was a perfect gift for my mom. I received the DVD today, and i am so dissapointed that it is not color? Why did they tell us it wasn't~"
5,Always a Great One,This movie is a great one to have for the holidays. The colors were vivid and it is certainly a movie the whole family can enjoy.
4,Very enjoyable,I purchased this movie because I am in this play at our church and felt like I needed to brush up on the characters. I found watching it to be very helpful.
4,It's a Wonderful Life,"Not only does this story warm my heart every year, it reminds me of the value of sacrifice, the importance of family and power of prayers. It's an absolute favorite."
5,It's a Wonderful Tale,"This is a classic in itself directed by Frank Capra starring James Stewart and Donna Reed. This film was once thought of as a flop, but it bounced back and beyond anyone's wildest imagination. James Stewart as George Bailey performs superbly in one of his most infamous roles. This movie is watched over and over by millions especially during the holiday season. It delivers a message of hope, romance, humor, failure and success. There aren't too many films out there that touch on so many emotions successfully. The movie reveals life's ups and downs, personal struggles and triumphs. This is a great movie, if you have never seen it, I recommend you watch it this winter."
5,Great DVD,"This is an all-time favorite for my family. This dvd came as a two disc set. One in original black and white, the other in color. I loved the option of watching the color version, very well done. I would recommend this to a friend."
5,Great Christmas Movie,The colorized version is very well done. Plus you have the B&W; version it that floats your boat.It is nice to have both.
5,It's a Wonderful Life,Viewing this video is a great way to start the holiday season. Great family video and some good life lessons to be discussed.
5,It's a Wonderful Life was great.,Seen many times but its a great old flick with very good acting and directing. Black andwhite quality excellent.
4,good movie,"I've read a lot of reviews about this movie wherin the reviewer complains that this movie is too sappy, or sexist, or whatever. Bottom line, this movie was made back in 1946, where family was still the center of life, where the father was the head of the household. Much as many people would like, you can not re-write the past. I think this is a great movie, with an awesome lesson. No matter how bad you think your life is (no matter if you're a man, woman, or child), someone else's life would be worse were it not for you."
5,It's a wonderful movie,"I've never felt so warm watching a movie as when I saw this classic for the first time. When the young Mary whispers into George's deaf ear, I'm hooked.What amazes me is that this movie seemed to gather mothballs for 30 years before becoming a phenomenon in the 1970s. I don't remember it being shown even during Christmas in the 1960s, and I had never even heard of it until Jimmy Stewart was on the Tonight Show, and Johnny Carson remarked what a great film it was. I saw it at a midnight movie in college a short time later, and I couldn't believe how perfect it was. A year or two later, it was on PBS a billion times each holiday, and it seemed like everyone fell in love with it then. I can't blame 'em."
4,GREAT FILM...RIPOFF REISSUE,"Buyers beware....This supposedly ""new"" 60th Anniversary Edition of ""It's a Wonderful Life"" is THE EXACT SAME DISC AS THE PREVIOUSLY RELEASED VERSION FROM REPUBLIC PICTURES / ARTISAN!!!! The only differencne is that the new version is from the Scrooges at Paramount DVD and they've added new cover art (whoop-de-doo).In addition, the ""new"" disc has the same bonus features and the same B&W; transfer as the older edition. Paramount desperately needs to GIVE THIS FILM A REAL SPECIAL EDITON and stop suckering consumers into buying a product they already own!!!!!By the way, there is NO COLORIZED VERSION on the 60th Anniversary DVD or the older release. Amazon has mistakenly listed this title as ""color"" and misled several reviewers to say that there actually was a colorized print on the disc. THIS IS WRONG!"
1,"not relaxing, actually makes me MORE nervous","This ""music"" is fine for background if you are having a party with lots of chatter, but for relaxation, not for me. It's way too heavy on the percussion, lots of ""dut-ti-dut-dut"" stuff going on all the time. The thunderstorm ""rain"" just sounds like somebody pouring a pitcher of water onto a flat rock."
1,Not so great,"NOT HAPPY !!!I ordered 3 sets for my Can-Am UTV. I was sent 3 driver side. Can you believe that - useless.I had the UTV apart, so I had to go get stock brakes so I could ride. I couldn't wait to returned the already opened boxed.Never mail ordere brakes again. NOT HAPPY !!"
2,no!,"Lord help me, I bought this because I thought it was the pre-Saxon version of SOB (they formed in 1974 and changed their name to Saxon soon after) and that these recordings were ya know... vintage.But no. It is 1996 and Graham Oliver and Steve Dawson have re-formed the OLD band for some reason, and here we have some passable if run-of-the-mill metal with painfully generic singer (Ted Bullet of Thunderhead ""fame""), whom I suspect wrote that other review. And is responsible for talking about a ""slob-job on my throb-knob"" on this record. Please.Since I wouldn't want my own misinformation to detract from the actual quality herein -- two stars. But that's because I didn't figure in the power of my disappointment."
5,Son of a Bitch ROCKS,"In April 1998, SONOFABITCH toured Brazil after the album release of ""Victim You"". Ted Bullet's singing and the musical talents of Graham Oliver and Steve Dawson, formerly of Saxon, wowed the crowds in South America. Since 1988, Ted Bullet's voice has been ROCKIN' international crowds. Ted's 'Killer Rock' style is demonstrated in the 9 CD's he has released. These recording continue to be tremendous hits with Ted's loyal followers in Germany, Japan and Brazil. Ted has been a major contributor to the bands---THUNDERHEAD and SONOFABITCH. In addition to his vocal talents, Ted also writes all of his songs and most of his music. Many of these bands recordings have been produced by Ted as well. TED BULLET IS NOW RECORDING WITH A NEW BAND IN THE USA!"
2,not for smart squirrels,"Haven't yet had this feeder long enough to talk about its weatherproofness... But, without the metal ring to deter the squirrels - I almost ordered it - OUR squirrels think it is an awesome feeder! :( Not only do they fit nicely between the seed dispenser and the bottom tray, but they are eating away at the plastic lip of the dispenser. It's just a matter of time before they gnaw off the whole lip, which will open up the dispenser and empty out the seed. I've only had this a week. Great investment. There goes another 65 bucks. Time to make my own feeder. And yes, I considered buying the metal ring to guard against the squirrels, but I've read that it is impossible for cardinals (and probably most birds) to work their way into the slots. Birds shouldn't have to work so hard ! Hard for me to believe it is impossible to manufacture a feeder that 1) keeps out squirrels, and 2) is weather proof.groan."
5,"No Mess, Less Waste, Savings","We live in the Florida Panhandle area and we have lots of birds that visit this feeder. We've had it up for 3 months now and I've never had to clean out the seed chamber. We have cleaned out the tray a couple of times. The squirrels have left it alone so far and the woodpeckers don't waste the volumes they used to on other feeders. All the birds are now used to it even though it took a couple of weeks (the Cardinals were not very smart about it and took longer to figure it out). I also don't have a mound of sunflower seeds/hulls under the feeder like we used to have. I used to go thru several 20 lb bags of sunflower seeds every spring/summer, I would say the lack of waste has allowed us to purchase probably 1/3 of what we used to go thru, justifying the higher price of the feeder."
3,Least popular and most expensive feeder of 5,"Didn't know much about birdfeeders 6 mos ago. Live in So Cal on a canyon. Bought a goldfinch mesh feeder, liked watching them and added 4 more. The second most popular here is a mesh sunflower seed dispenser. Other basic platform or perched platforms purchased from Big box stores for about $15 are still in higher demand and the seed is eaten fast enough to make weather related spoilage not an issue. Hard to justify the price of this feeder for this area."
1,"Very disappointed, ESP for the price",Good quality. Visually a nice design. Trouble is that only the sparrows and house finches have figured out how to use it--and ONLY if I use hulled sunflower seeds. Cardinals can't or won't use it. Using my seed of preference--safflower--then nothing can use it. Very disappointed
1,terrible,i have at least 30 bird feeders this is the worst i every had trying to refill it is a nightware 67 dollars was nuts they should be giving it away cant sent back try to refill it n it fell apart crased down into pieces DONT BY THIS FEEDER YOUR ONLY WASTING YOUR MONEY
1,Still no birds,I've had this since the summer and had couple but they couldn't figure out how to get to the seed...have left it out and still no birds. Also seed in tray still gets wet in rain and then they don't want it. Have cleaned out the tray and put fresh seed but they have given up on it. Very disappointed for the price!
3,O.K Movie,This movie is diffrent then all the other Kung Fu classicsbut also with very bad dubbingbut fun to whatchit's based on the true story on the japanese invasion in 1937
1,because 0 stars was not an option!,"This early supporting role by Jackie Chan will leave you wondering how he ever got another. In this he plays a resistance fighter during WW2 against the eeeeeeeeeevil Japanese, and his acting is so bad that you're almost relieved when the Japs finally kill him near the end, in one of the goriest death scenes ever. This film is relentlessly grim and gruesome, not even worth the price of a rental unless you're a crazed, masochistic fan who just can't get enough Jackie."
3,Your basic Chinese vs. Jap movie.,"My uncle lended this movie to me, and I didn't know that Jackie Chan didn't have the Main Role! And he also played the role of Caesar? C'mon, guys. This film is made in 1973, the time when Bruce Lee made ""Enter The Dragon"". It also had Ho Lee Yan (Who played the ""Old Man"" in ETD) who played the Uncle of the family which the 2 heroes lived with. This Chinese resistance family had to deal with the Japs just as they were the Syndicate! But the bad news...is that Caesar (Chan) bleeds to death BIG TIME by the Jap henchmen. And the way the Japs killed the remaining resistance fighters before the main hero comes to save them was too gory, talk about a child being thrown to the boulder HEAD FIRST! UGH! Don't buy this movie if it's too bloody for you."
1,Don't even waste your time reading my review!,"I agree with the previous review, and I beg you not to waste your time and money with this movie. The fight scenes are poorly choreographed and the storyline is hokey (but not in the traditional Chan way).PLEASE DO NOT BUY ME!Zakarius"
2,Lost,"I wore this anklet twice and then it was gone. I believe it broke at one of the hearts, the anklet is a white gold heart and then gold chain, then heart etc and I think the anklet has a weak point where the white heart is attached to the chain. So it was gone and I was very disappointed. Although it was a beautiful anklet and I was happy in the beginning, I don't think the way it is put together is very strong. I'm sad."
1,Cheap and poorly designed,"I was very disappointed in almost every way.The interface is archaic and awkward. This is 2007. It looks straight out of 1997. They need to get with the times. The least they could do is put text labels on the buttons. It's too bad they invested in appealing packaging instead of sensible interface design.I was required by the program to change my screen resolution. This is odd because most programmers have little trouble integrating that into code. Well, this is a flash-based program, so I guess we can t expect that level of sophistication.The animations are crude. It's without exaggeration to say that most people can hand draw better than this.The whole product amounts to little more than a mishmash of other programs thrown together by people more interested in selling than educating. There are far better resources all over the Internet."
3,Way Overpriced!,"Mr. McElroy's book has some neat math shortcuts for common aviation problems, but it is a pretty skinny book and not worth near the asking price. I've been an airline pilot for about 5 years, and a military pilot for about 10 before that. I'll admit that there were 2 or 3 shortcuts I didn't know (though less that I'll actually use!), but the prevailing comment among other airline pilots I showed it to were ""You can tell the author is an airline pilot!"" as they pointed to the $27+ price. I agree, this book is worth $10 or $12 tops. . .I could summarize all the shortcuts in a page or two. As for interview prep, you're better off using one of the books written specically for that purpose."
2,I am a bit puzzled,"This book is over rated! It comes across as giving the pilot all these tips and formula&#65533;s but falls way short on the task. First off, the typeset fills only half the page making the book in reality about 25 pages. It goes on to show you basic math found in any private pilot instruction guide. FH/C temp conversion, subtracting military time, and RVR which is all the same as in the NOS/Jep charts and Ops manuals for the plane you fly. The second half of the book has the times tables, subtraction tables, and division tables. He put fuel dump calculations in along with wet runway computations, this is not only a waste for pilots flying anything short of a jet, but worthless due to FMS and EFIS on bigger airplanes not to mention the F/E sitting sideways behind the captain. In short the book is outdated. finding reciprocals, compass turns to a heading, and ANDS are all in the flight manuals. In short this book fails to teach much. It is not worth the [price] that is for sure."
1,Mental Math for Pilots,"Mental Math for Pilots fills a very specific niche in aviation knowledge. If it were not for the very specific math questions asked during a Major Airline interview knowledge test, the book would be almost useless. Almost every technique taught in the book is beyond what you would ever need to know or have time to figure out in the flight deck. It is the perfect book for those in the academic world that do not spend their working life in the cockpit. Furthermore, for the price of the book, the content is very limited. Explanations of problems are lacking and often times leave you wondering how the author came up with the answer from what is written. The author will give a problem and the answer, yet leave out the explanation of how to arrive at that answer."
1,Awful,"In reality, it's not an awful book. In fact, there are quite a number of things which can be filed under the ""good to know"" category. However, I'm so bitter at paying such an outrageous price for this book that I simply cannot bring myself to give it anything more than a very poor rating. Don't bother, there are better (and more reasonably priced) sources."
3,Not bad,"Lots of neat rules of thumb and mental math exercises. I'd like to have seen SOMETHING about interpolation and landing distance charts, especially from this book. I felt like it stopped short and covered too much grade school math."
5,Essential for interview preperation.,This is an excellent book for anyone preparing for an airline interview. I was recently hired by a regional airline and several interview questions consisted of mental math problems. Buy this book and the ATP test prep....good luck!
4,I like it,very nice Thank You. I am sure i will fined a lot of helpful things in this book. Thank You again.
4,A splendid biography,"The appointment of Supreme Court Justice Samuel Freeman Miller by President Lincoln was perhaps his best decision before the Civil War. Miller's life story is well written by Dr. Ross and perhaps will be the definitive study of the man for generations to come.Ross provides new insights into Supreme Court cases, such as the Slaughter House rulings and other important judicial issues of the Civil War and Reconstruction. But perhaps what is Ross's finest work is his ability to articulate Miller's character. The author's background on the Justice fully prepared the reader for understanding why Miller voted on a certain issue. In doing so, the reader can clearly comprehend the various court decisions of that era.Clearly, the judicial system of the Civil War is one of the few areas of that time period with insufficient attention. Ross's book will hopefully ignite a spark to this unknown subject of American history."
5,Tomine is the literal visual counterpart to Raymond Carver,"Okay, I'm bias. I have a crush on the man but that doesn't mean you can't enjoy Adrian's work. He brings about bittersweet narratives that are not unlike Carver's own. 'Sleepwalk' contains his more heavy-hearted work and '32 stories' carries his more cynically humorous self published endeavors with Optic Nerve. I highly reccomend both."
2,Still in the Pupal Stage...,"These earlier, shorter stories are rather flat, and don't stand up to Tomine's later work, collected in ""Summer Blonde."" Tomine works best when he has the time and space allotted to really build his characters, and the short stories herein do not allow for it. As simply a portrait of a developing young artist, ""Sleepwalk and Other Stories"" is somewhat interesting, but certainly not a fully realized or especially enjoyable book."
3,Adrian Tomine Saves Comics,"I wish there were more comics out there like Adrian Tomine's. The characters in the stories collected here could almost be characters in a Belle and Sebastian song and those are some of my favorite kinds of characters. There are only a handful of artists doing thoughtful, literary work in comics and Tomine is one of them. In a medium with limitless possibilities Tomine is among the few trying to explore them."
5,Everything I Long for,Love this music! It's fresh and makes you want to sing along with all the words.
3,Two goods songs; that's it,"""Bad as they Seem"" and ""At My parent's House"" are the two good songs on this slow, almost sad CD. His style does remind me of James Iha (Smashing Pumpkins), which is good, 'cause I like anything Pumpkins."
5,Company through my lonely teenage years,"Recorded in his basement on a four-track, this album was Hayden's first big success. Most of the tracks have a seriously bummed out theme to them, while some of them manage just a gentle sadness. The raw, heartfelt music is Hayden at his very best. Later albums, though good, never acheived the same level of genuine feeling that this one has.Don't expect to buy this album and feel happy listening to it. But if you're going through a rough breakup or experiencing a futile crush, or anything else that's just a bummer, this album will be there to keep you company. At least you'll know that you're not the only one who has it rough."
4,pine needles in our hair,this is how it is. the album is absolutely amazing. this cd in my discman accompanies me into sleep every night. i never tire of his voice spinning the most fabulously depressing tales. his eeriely perfect voice weaves its way into my thoughts. it makes me want to show up randomly at his door. we would let the woods or a junkyard find us wiling away the day.
4,"''DONT WORRY,BE HAPPY''","This guy has a problem and he wants to share it with you and boy o boy is he sad and downright miserable,why he could give ELBOW and THOM YORKE a run for their money in the moping around stakeshowever HAYDEN has a certain style about him that is oddly compelling and you will want to listen to each 'story' just to see how things pan out.He's in to LO-FI in a big way,the whole thing sounds like it was recorded on his porch,but there's no getting away from the fact that this guy has a strong,grungey voice and is 1000% sincere in what he does and how rare is thatin todays world of (mostly) talentless prima-donnas?EVERYTHING I LONG FOR is perfect listening on those rainy days when you wish you were on a beach in hawaii,though i must add not with HAYDEN for company.It is original and heartfelt(but it wont cheer you up)."
3,"Not as bad as I thought, but still a ripoff","I bought this film ...for a laugh, but was actually kinda surprised that it wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be. It's still a rip-off of both Leone's 'Fistful of Dollars' and 'For a Few Dollars More', but is mildly entertaining for spaghetti western fans. Still, it should have been titled under it's other moniker, 'Trade Your Pistol in for a Coffin'"
3,A Great Spaghetti Western!!! A Not So Great DVD!!!,"This is a great spaghetti western!!! It's full of that classic spaghetti action and comedy!!! It's nice to see these classics on DVD, but this movie deserves much,much better!!! The three star rating is for the movie, not the DVD, which looks like a SLP VHS tape!!! The picture is terrible, well, for a DVD anyway!!! But the sound is actually good, still this DVD is pretty bad. This DVD is not widescreen either and the picture is severely cropped!!!"
2,"Very poor quality transfer to DVD, not even worth the $5 !","I'm a big fan of spaghetti westerns, especially all the ones that recently came out on DVD. However, I have to say this is by far the shoddiest transfer to DVD that I've seen. It looks like they worked off a poor tape copy instead of the original master, or maybe the master was damaged. A real disappointment. The movie itself is OK, but it's not in the same league as a ""Keoma"" or a ""Texas Adios"". Avoid at all cost !!!"
1,Waste of time and money.,"This movie should be sent free and have a $20.00 bill enclosed. The film quality is extremely poor, it is the worst sound dubbing I have encountered so far and the acting is not worth talking about. Stick with the Trinity movies and you can't go wrong."
2,DVDLESS,"Well, I thought this was a great product and it would have been except it did not come with the DVD. Without the recorded conversations, this is just another reader without any reference material. Called AMazon upon recieving it and they really did not help so now I have a book of conversations that I cannot listen to. Don't buy it unless Amazon has it with the DVD!"
2,Italia Contemporanea,This text is designed to be LISTENED to. It consists of transcribed interviews intended to be accompanied by a SOUND recording. The paperback alone is of diminished use and cannot be used as the book was designed. Instructions in the book prescribe LISTENING several times before reading. I will try to find another copy elsewhere. Possibly Europa bookstore or the publisher: Yale.
3,Broke! The software is great though.,"Worked great for a year & then suddenly wouldn't play, but I've learned to play lots of songs on it & the included interactive software is priceless for beginners."
4,Pleasing overall...,"Beethoven's Symphonies are very popular among the classical community, and hence there are many versions and sets to choose from. This box set is wonderful for a classical lover who desires to obtain the complete symphonies, but can't afford to spend a hundred dollars in the process. This is by far not the best performance ever recorded by any means, but overall, it stays close to the music and is very traditional. So if you desire to gain a better appreciation for Beethoven's symphonies, but aren't willing or are unable to spend alot of money doing it, this is the perfect box set for you."
4,A very good box set for a low price,"I found this a moderate edition of the 9 Beethoven symphonies. For the cheapskate collecter, this is a great pick. The pieces are played wonderfully, with not many mistakes, and Herbert Kegel does a great job conducting this mediocre orchestra. If what you want is the overall tune, this would be good also, but if you want versions of the 9 symphonies that are perfect, buy them seperately performed by big name orchestras."
5,Excellent value!,"Analog multimeters, like clocks, give quicker relative readings than admittedly more accurate digital meters. This meter is an excellent choice of relative accuracy and a quick reading. Highly recommended."
1,I HATE this device,"All of my past MP3 players had a nice, easy, drag-and-drop interface for loading files, but this one insists upon using the Sonic Stage program to load files. Since Sonic Stage crashes my computer every time I try to run it (there's a conflict with some other software I currently have loaded, and I gave up trying to find out which software it was) I'm stuck having to load Sonic Stage on my work computer. This means every time I want to change music I have to burn my music to a disk and drag the dang thing to work, load the music onto my hard-drive, re-start my computer, THEN add music to the MP3 player.Mostly it just sits in a drawer at home because putting music on it is just too much hassle. I think I've actually used it about five times since I ""treated"" myself to it for Christmas. Great value for my money, huh?"
1,Crippled Functionality,"Once again, Sony has designed a great product with incredible functionality only to severely cripple it with over the top digital rights management. I bought this unit to transfer legally purchased mp3 files (that do play on my iPod) only to find out that they ""cannot play"". Sony tech support indicates that the hardware will not allow mp3's to play if the drm cannot be ascertained - I sent them one of the files and they couldn't figure out why it wouldn't work either. It does do some things exceptionally well, such as play music, has fairly simple controls, great battery life and takes disposable batteries as well as a rudimentary but functional display that lights up to make it easier to see at night. It also holds a lot of songs as Sony indicates in their literature. Unfortunately, it does require that you use the Sony supplied software to transfer songs into it - and the Sonic Stage software is nowhere as user friendly as the Apple iTunes software."
3,not the best but good enough,"well here is my take on it...doesnt' have the best sound quality but i bought it to use it for my workout so is great for it. if i want great sound then i'll just use my ipod. it's light and best of all it uses an external AAA battery. i have used the psyc for 16 hours now...battery level is still at the highest...what else can i say? if only ipod used AAA's. if you're looking for a 512MB player, you're probably looking for something that you can use for your jogging or some workout session...if not you should be looking for a hard drive player. it's 99 bucks too....how many other 512mb players do you get for 99? besides the ipod shuffle i don't see any...and it has a display too....anyway...if you're looking for great sound....go somewhere else, if you're looking to workout with it look no further. Oh and one more thing....this thing can get loud...seriously loud...with the volume level at half it's as loud and my ipod will ever get...just one more thing to consider."
3,Get a free iPod nano instead!,"Why settle for less, when you can get a brand new original iPod nano 4GB for Free! I got mine from this web site: http://snurl.com/ipodnano4"
1,Stay Away From Sony,Until Sony ditches their proprietary ATRAC format stay away....stay VERY far away!
2,to good to be true,"plastic casing looks so cheap, earphones looks generic, compared to ipods , quality is incomparable. sonic stage software, is hard to manage, worked fine with windows XP pro, but when updated the ver 3.0 that originally came with the player to ver 4.2 fialed to work had to go back to ver 3.0 and ver 3.0 doesn't work on windows XP mediacenter.Sound is decent enough but max volume is not loud enough."
1,What a hassle!!!,"Here's the rub. If you use a legal download service such as Rhapsody, the files won't play in this device. So, you are forced to use Sony's at $1.00 a track as opposed to .79 or less. I blew 20 bucks downloading from Rhapsody into my sony and it wouldn't recognize the files. Really a pain. I just wanted a small, lightweight MP3 player. What I got was a big pain in the butt."
3,"great hardware, frustrating proprietary software","The hardware is great. I'm very impressed by the battery life, weight, etc. Unfortunately there are two problems with the software/firmware which are overly proprietary.1. The device is incredibly finicky about codecs. Many files can be played only by converting them to WAV and back to MP3 or ATRAC.2. There's no drag and drop, you have to use Sonic Stage to get files on the device.So if you plan on buying files from Sony or using Sony's software to rip cds, it's great. But if you want to leave the Sony bubble and use, say podcasts, it can be a serious hassle."
2,Ugh. You can do better for less money....,"First and most important, the battery life is NOT, repeat NOT, what it claims to be. The only reason I purchased this thing is because I figured I would save money with the extra long battery life when it came time to purchase batteries. Think again. Strike one.The sound quality is just plain bad. Most of the time there is an awful hissing noise in the background. I also like my music loud, but at full volume, you won't get eardrum-thumping sound, no matter what phones you use with it. Strike two.Sony's music connect service is the worst I have ever seen. I purchased an album a year ago and it still can't finish the download. Like a fool, I actually tried again and I still experienced the same problem. Two albums purchased and no music to show for it. MAJOR strike three. This product sucks and so does Sony."
1,DON'T BOTHER ! ! !,"Nothing new, and the techniques and samples presented were amateurish at best. I only wasted 10 dollars and I can get at least half of this back on eBay."
1,NOT the uncut 143 min. version,"This review is to point out that this version (Westlake Entertainment) of Escape from Sobibor (which is a great docudrama) is NOT the uncut 143 minute version as indicated in the Amazon listing and also indicated on the DVD cover. In fact, it is the 120 minute version offered by many other distributors. In addition, the transfer on this Weslake version is not great. I have the TGG/Diamond version (also 120 minutes) which is a much better transfer."
4,Hauer is as good as we always suspected,"Somehow I just knew hauer could be an exceptional actor. You get glimpses of it in his performances in films like ""Blade Runner"" and ""Lady Hawk"". But here in this film, as a captured Russian Jewish soldier,plotting the escape of the entire prison population of a Nazi concentration camp, he shines. I first saw this movie on The History Channel, but don't hold that against it. The plot is captivating, the acting superb, and the rush you get during the simultaneously terrible and glorious climax is powerful. Equal to Schindler's list at a fraction of the budget, this is a MUST SEE film."
1,escape from sobibor,i feel like i got ripped off on this item it was not remaster like it said it was and it was all cut up. i was not happy at all. russell smith
5,STILL POWERFUL AFTER TWENTY YEARS,"Film is still excellent. Almost unbearable without the commercial breaks.Apparently I got lucky when I ordered the VHS tape and the version I have has not been edited. Other reviewers have described the film in detail, so I won't add to that. What is really sad is that this was made for network television. Anything like this would be produced by Showtime or HBO now. And that is not only sad, it's tragic."
2,DVD Quality,"I watched this movie about 15 yrs. ago and was so excited that Amazon had it available. The only bad thing is that the DVD's quality is horrible! And this is suppose to be a remastered edition? I paid the extra money because I thought it would be digitally enhanced / dolby digital, etc.........It looks like someone was watching this movie on their own TV and they recorded it with a video camera. I love Amazon but I have noticed a lot of unhappy customers with this one."
2,Poor presentation,"This movie in no way does justice to the people it portrays. The dialogue is delivered in a weak and overemphasized manner. It is obvious that the actors do not embody their parts. Thanks to poor make-up and wardrobe efforts, the actors appear to well nourished and healthy looking to be believable. Do not expect anything even close to Schindlers List or the haunting performance of Adrian Brody in ""The Pianist"". Unfortunately, this was a magnificent story presented very poorly."
3,It was made in the 80s,"The movie has some very good historical information. Keep in mind; it was made int he 80s. Like most things in the 80s, it was big: big music, big scenes, and some cheesy images. I'm using the movie for high school students, and I can see them laughing at material that really isn't funny because of the time in which it was made."
4,Take on one of the lesser known rebellions,"The technology in the movie is certainly old fashioned, but...the story is still there. This movie shows one of the lesser known responses of concentration camp prisoners. It is important to show that there were reactions, people were not sheep being led to slaughter. These prisoners had so much at stake no matter their job at the camps. Be prepared for violence and the ugliness of the Holocaust. Remember the time period of the filming and you will understand the lack of computerization. A worthwhile film to see."
3,Sobibor for small televisions,This is a great story- about triumph under the most extreme of circumstances. Its based on actual accounts of witnesses and has the tension and drama only a true story could provide. The problem is that the 4x3 dvd transfer is so bad it looks like a nearsighted and or drunk technician took a wonderful movie and smeared it onto a dvd in a fit of stupor. Please- see the movie on tv-but dont even think about buying this dvd unless you have a 5 inch tv.
1,Excellent movie - terrible DVD,"I agree with other comments that have been made about the poor quality ofthis 'digitally remastered' DVD. The picture quality is terrible, and themovie has been abridged. This story deserves better."
1,Escape from Sobibor 1987 (Remastered Edition) NOT!,I recently purchased this DVD because it stated that it had been remastered with additional minutes added to the film. The film was neither remastered nor was any additional length of the film added. The picture quality was very poor and grainy. I was extremely upset and disapointed in this product. I would not recommend this DVD to anyone. I am currently is the process of getting a re-credit to my debit card. What a waste of time!
3,interesting but ordinary,"I love WW2 movies and the story is interesting and from true facts. But the quality is a little poor and it is more a TV movie than a real one, between a documentary and a movie. But I like to see new faces and ""dive"" into the conditions of life from the war. Would we be brave like they were? Would we take those kinds od risks instead of waiting at the end of the war? Bravery and faith into each other are the heart of that story."
5,A Movie Worth Seeing,"Excellent movie and superb acting. This movie made us cry but showed us courage and bravery in the midst of German occupation. Hope this thing will never happen again, ever."
3,It was good.,"This movie was for my daughter for her class project, it was a big help to her, thank you. JC"
4,Escape from Sobibor,"A bit more brutal than I remember, but, I watched it without getting too sad. I saw it in 87' when firstreleased. Was good movie for the era."
3,I keep on wanting to know what happens next,Subject says it all: I keep on wanting to know what happens next but I'm not certain that I'll continue to buy books in this series.
4,"Much better, not as gruesome.","Better then the previous couple of books, more medical, less creepy stuff. I enjoyed a lot of the interactions, and finding out more things about the characters. A bit irritating with the child's speak, and them not paying more attention to what the kid could do, but enjoying the other relationships and everyone working together."
3,More of the same,"I really enjoyed the first two Stardoc books, and the third book was OK. Unfortunately, the fourth book was a chore to finish. It's not just that it is more of the same medical emergency and melodrama as its predecessors. The new characters and new alien societies introduced in this book are not very interesting. When you get right down to it, it's the quality of the villain in a melodrama that makes it. The best Viehl comes up with for a villian in Eternity Row is a bad tempered fiancee. I'm afraid the series is loosing steam."
3,it's ok,"I agree that books 1 and 2 were much more interesting. I admit that, before reading Shockball, I discovered Viehl had written some romance books and that tained my opinion of her writing. Hence, the intimate scenes in Shockball read like a romance and that annoyed me. I found several plot holes and contradictions but if you don't care about such things, the book is an ok read. The fate of the main character's ""father"" seemed somewhat anti-climatic but there was lots of other plot-finishing going on to make up for it a bit."
2,SF Babytalk,"The first couple of Stardoc novels featured intresting alien cultures, excitement and ethical dilemmas. This one not only disappoints on those issues, but features the most annoyingly cute little kid since Totty in ADAM BEDE. You need a hit of insulin to get through this one. This supposedly gifted kid can't get out two words without baby talk, made exculsively of oh-so-cute misprounciations. What a tweet widdle kawaktow--not. As Dorothy Parker said, ""Tonstant Weader Frowed Up."""
3,Not the best,S.L. Viehl has created a fascinating world that captivates me every time I venture into it. I love everything she (?) has written and wait with bated breath until the next book comes out. I do think the focus needs to move from Cherijo and maybe other characters introduced.
5,what history programming should be,"As a gift, I received the BBC series on British history by Simon Schama a few years back, and can't get enough. I have searched a long time to find anything of comparable quality. Everything I viewed was seriously disappointing, until I found this one. It does not talk down to me, or present history with the sensationalism of America's Most Wanted (which seems to be par for the course at The History Channel and increasingly PBS as well). I learned a great deal, and will be able to learn much more as I watch it again and again. I only wish I could find more BBC-produced histories, as they seem the only ones capable of doing it right."
5,Excellent Documentary,"""The Celts - Rich Traditions & Ancient Myths"" is truly an excellent film which brings to life the culture of the Celts. Throughout, it provides the viewer with a thorough and in-depth look at this ancient people who have contributed greatly to modern society. Enya's beautiful music is a nice complement to this documentary."
2,Not what the title and box portray.,"This documentary started strong with history and reenactments, but then went off into boring tangents like ""modern Celts"" with scenes of people dancing in clubs. What? The narrator talks endlessly while standing on some historical spot. I was waiting for Monty Python to come running through with a gag it was so mind-numbing. I had to stop the dvd half way through out of sheer boredom. I would have loved to have seen more engrossing history, more reenactments, more history, and less long-winded dry speeches in which I didn't learn much of anything."
5,Factual and Accessible,"This series presents facts and information on a hard to define and often misinterpreted people and period. It is heavy in facts and research (supported/provided by top museums and historians), yet it is accessible to both the first time celt seeker and the serious enthusiast."
5,The Celts,"I recently had my DNA tested at the Oxford Ancestors lab at the Oxford University in England, mainly to see just who were my distant ancestors.The results came back as Celtic blood on both sides, maternal and paternal. Naturally I wanted to know everything I could about the Celts. This entertaining BBC documentary, narration by the author Frank DeLaney, has provided me with historical information about these amazing people called the Celts.Much aloha, Bill"
5,The Summer of the Danes,"I found this a marvelous mystery, though, as in most of this author's mysteries, the mystery is not important. The important thing is the words, the well-developed characters, and the lack of stereotypical characters.I have a question for the person who said that all Peter's heroes were tall, blond, and muscular. I would like to ask how many he has read, as it is actually rare that the heroes are blond. Take a look at Hugh Beringar, Torold Blund and Brother Cadfael himself for some examples! And in the Hermit of Eyton Forest, the protagonist is a child with many childish characteristics.The books are very good in general, though there are one or two that are not up to par. This is not one of her best, however, so you might try A Morbid Taste for Bones or One Corpse Too Many, which are both very good. I recommend this series to anyone who likes medieval mysteries!"
5,Reviews your rusty English while it teaches you Spanish!,"Concise yet thorough coverage of Spanish grammar. Gives English comparisons -- or tells you if the grammar is unique to Spanish so you can save time hunting for an English ""equivalent"". Appendices include: English Grammar Terms, Commonly Confused and Misused Terms, Conjugations of 30 Common Verbs. Ten verb tenses are summarized, including common irregular present & past participles. This has been my ""go-to"" aide for Freshman Spanish I and II. I highly recommend it!"
3,repreposessing,"second time i have seen it in a long while...is judged incompatible with other genres for those who incline to them and i agree...is likely to feel empty to those not prepared to embrace it by a fairly deep involvement with scifi...as one of the prepossessed, starting with two of the great founders, h.g. wells, and jules verne, i found a second browse of it to be worth the visit, and enjoyed refreshing much faded recollections of it...my sister has a strong preference for costume dramas...i prefer action, dramas that do not force upon me 18th century austrian wars or elizabethan court intrigues...and never miss a scifi if it has any quality at all...so...for you heinleiner mainlainers, i expect you will find rm to be fairly satisfying...others may want to keep their distance as it's good, but no classic...ciao."
2,This movie should be repossessed,"This film had a great premise, a talented cast, and a budget to make it work. What it didnt have was decent writing. This is a cautionary tale for writers and directors that have no clear vision for what the film should be. It was all over the place, unable to commit to being a dark comedy, a drama, or an action flick. It was utterly disappointing. The only thing that made it watchable were great performances by Jude Law and Forest Whitaker. They obviously had the budget to create a good film; the sets were darkly atmospheric, they had an A list cast, etc, but they couldnt make it work. It reminded me of Robocop, in that they tried to blend dark comedy with action and drama in a corporate-run future society, but where that movie committed to a premise and worked, this one failed. It may have been saved, but the ending effectively contradicted everything that you'd watched for the last hour."
1,butchering,"If you think there is a final line no movie should even close, think again. This bloody mess not only reaches, it flies right over it. By far. Morale is absolutely not an issue.A job is a job. Human bodies are dissected by coldblood killers hired by evil Union corporation in order to take back forgs - mechanical organ transplants. From those who defaulted on their obligations. Cut out from paralized humans, with no anestesia. Humans are left to die. Kids are not spared.Movie is supposed to give something, entertain, impress you. This butcher can only entertain serial killers and give you PTSD. If you choose to see this movie - make sure you have a stomach for it. Warn you, it can not be unseen."
1,What a waste of a great plot,I felt this movie wasted the amazing plot line it had. It was a big dismantlement and the ending was terrible. I was really looking forward to watching this and now realize there is about two hours of my life I am never getting back.
1,Repo Man - AVOID,Repo Man is probably one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Couldn't bear to watch it. Wasted such talented actors - or at least I had thought they were. But why would they take these roles. Horrible premise. AVOID!
3,worth watching if you're into that sort of thing,"This movie is basically eXistenZ without the slime and with more violence and blood.Uninspired plot. Mediocre writing. Good acting. Love the cinematography. Love the soundtrack (Róisín Murphy FTW!). There's a ""sex"" scene at the end that brings whole new meaning to the term ""gore porn."" It's intense. When I saw that scene in the theater I actually had a moment where I thought to myself, ""I'm not sure I'm old enough to be watching this."" And I'm 24. In fact, that scene is pretty much the only reason I bought this DVD.Aside from that, the movie's got some racefail, but it's not much worse than James Cameron's Avatar in that regard. Let's just say this is not Whitaker's proudest moment as an African American actor. It also fails the Bechdel test, not that anybody in the target demographic would really care. I just figured I'd put that out there on the off chance I'm not the only woman of color interested in this movie.See alsoRepo! The Genetic Opera."
4,UltraViolent Escapism SciFi Style,"NOT a ""family"" movie! Nor for the squeamish.I watched this while eating dinner, and surgery doesn't really go that well with food. However, if you're jaded like me, well...it's like a test.This is just fiction, possibly a ""guy film"", and is what some movies are intended to be: ESCAPIST.It's not about reality, but there is a hint of a morality tale here and it's an old standard one.Nothing new about this type of story except possibly the level of blood and gore which is just included because really it's necessary because it's part of the story.Sex and language are not overdone or gratuitous and there is no apparent political agenda."
4,killer ending makes it,"ok a little slow maybe a little poorly put together and ok maybe this was a collage of at least 6 other movies but man that ending was done quite stylishly and now i feel good about so there ya go, worth seeing"
4,Excellent choice,I really enjoyed this movie the directing was sharp as well as the script and the story telling.The ending was unexpected .I highly recommend this movie.Michael Ewell
5,REPO MAN,"This is an excellent blu ray movie with excellent futuristic visuals set in an ultra modern metropolis. Based on a credit system, if you have an organ transplant, and have not payed your bill on time, instead of paying a late fee, a repo man is sent to repossess the organ while you are still alive! You either die on the spot, or if you have other means for a quick transplant, you better do it before it's too late! Imagine if that became your future, with black market donors being a refuge for those who can't afford it. This movie is insanely excellent with two men whose job is to rip your insides out for pay!"
5,Better than expected.,After having seen a couple of reviews before I bought this I was pleasantly surprised to find this film to be much more entertaining that expected. The ending was also a big plus in my opinion.
2,Excruciating,"This film tries to be edgy and suspenseful, but it's just a train-wreck in slow-motion. From the beginning, the viewer knows things will get ugly with the protagonists' friends and colleagues. Why the devil draw it out?The main character is likeable enough, his wife unpleasant in a silly, yet believable way. Sadly, his best friend - turned - killer is just a foil for the protagonist, and watching him fall out of love with his bestie is agony. For God's sake, if you're making an action movie, get the betrayal over with quick and move on to the retribution. Stringing it out just makes your audience uncomfortable and grouchy.This film tries to be a clever character study blended with speculative fiction. It fails at these things thanks to a cliche'd script, in spite of otherwise competent direction, acting and photography.C-"
1,Repo The Lighting Director,"Yeah, it's over!The lighting was so dark in the first half of the movie'that you lose interest because you can't really see the fight scenes.By the time the lighting is corrected you really don't care about the movie.If you can't see the actors you can't connect with them.I couldn't wait for it to end.Jude Law was fabulous as was Forest Whitaker.If not for them I would have turned it off sooner.Sorry guys you did the best with what you were given.~ Cornelius"
3,Wow. This movie was weird.,"This movie gets 4 stars for production value...but 3 stars for a whacked-out storyline. There's A LOT of pulp violence: knives cutting into flesh and squirting blood. If you're in the mood for violence and don't mind shallow character development, watch this."
2,"Derivative mashup of ""Logan's Run"" and ""Brazil""","Derivative mashup ofLogan's RunandBrazilspiced with a bit of the old ultra violence, erotic surgery, and a nice performance from Forest Whitaker. I didn't hate it."
3,Could have been much better,"I was disapointed with this movie...and after much consideration, I figured it out. The cast didn't mesh. That simple. Jude Law and Chiwetel Ejiofor would have been much better in the roles as Repo Men - Liev Schreiber wasn't more than a pseudo-bad guy salesman, Lance Henriksen or Michael Caine would have been much more to the point, and that would have made all the difference in this being rated as ""it's ok"" by me to a solid 5 star rating. Basically, all three main characters needed a british accent. And to be well suited for their roles, in my opinion. The plot is great - the thought behind the story is great as well - and as Jude is a perfect match, sorry....Forest isn't. Chiwetel's well known endearing facial scar would have put this over the top. Michael would have been the perfect british business bad-guy. Whoever cast this film really messed up. Hoping there's another version of this story line with the right cast..."
4,when a bad ending hurts a movie this is one of them,i liked this movie with the dark humor and action but i just dont understand why they had to ruin it with this ending
3,Surprising,"Being a simpleton, I thought this movie was going to be about repo-ing cars. Imagine my shock and surprise when I saw that it was body parts. While not loving the movie I liked it, and it kept my attention throughout."
4,I bought this movie after seeing it!,I saw this movie on Si Fi not knowing what to expect. I liked it so much I purchased the Amazon streaming. I wanted to see it uncut. It is a very good movie with good acting and a great story.The ending was crazy man!Loved it!
4,Very good movie,This was a very good movie. It had an interesting ending. The beginning was okay but seemed to drag a bit. enjoyed it at the $3.00 price of Amazon Prime but for me it wouldn't have been worth the price of seeing it in the theater.
3,Full of promise... Sometimes delivers!,"I held off for a long time before purchasing Repo Men. When the price was right I bought it. For what I paid it was a decent buy. Acting all around was good... Jude Law was his normal understated self while Forrest Whitiker was his normal, slightly over the top, overwrought self. The story line was good but never really fully developed as the movie progressed. All-in-all a good diversion for a Saturday night (I don't get out much) and worth a watch!"
2,Seriously?,"This movie was entertaining, but had one downfall: The ending. This was definitely a ""WTF?"" ending that came out of absolutely nowhere. I'm pretty sure the writer or producer just pulled this one right out of his you-know-what. The movie itself wasn't that bad. Without the absolutely ridiculous ending, it would have been 4 stars. DON'T WATCH THIS MOVIE!!! It's a big waste of your life and time."
5,Great Action Movie,I think this is one of the better action/indie films available. It reminded me about great movies like Equilibrium. Great action sequences with a perfect ending!
3,"Well, err, ummm,","I am almost embarrassed to admit I watched this movie. I thought it would be something the husband would enjoy, sci fi, action packed. Well, I have to admit for entertainment value it wasn't to bad. It did drag somewhat here and there, but you have to stick with it. Please don't take it to seriously, I mean really organ repo, and it is gruesome to think that people would have that job, they would have to be completely heartless. The only thing that kept me from giving this a low rating was the ending, I didn't see that coming but it put a nice twist on it."
2,There is a price for every organ,"This science fiction movie is a combination of science fiction, thriller and homoerotic attraction. In a distant future, everyone can get a second chance in life by having an artificial organ put in their body. But for such high technology lease on life, there is a steep price. Most people cannot afford it. They fall behind in their payments for the surgery and that is where our main character's repo men come into play. These men will kill if necessary in order to retrieve organs which can then be recycled to the next patient, or shall I say a victim.Film has many twists and moves, but Marx brothers rumble between two main characters played for Forrest Whitaker and Jude Law goes over the top at times. I watched unedited version of this film and some of the scenes of organ retrievement are quite graphic and perhaps even unnecessary."
3,Unique flick,"I've not seen Repo Genetic Opera, so I have nothing to compare this movie to. It's a solid film in its own right, though it could have been a bit tighter. After seeing this, I want to see the Genetic Opera flick so I can compare this. The ending was a surprise, and I'm not sure if I enjoyed it or not. Overall it's not a bad flick."
1,Complete Waste of Money and Talent,"This movie isn't worth buying, let alone renting. The concept is asinine and it is a liberal screed that tries to portray the horrors of private medical care, as if public care doesn't already do the same and worse. Rather than get into a debate over rationing of medical care (every system does so, public & private alike), this violent and pointless film comes down on private medical care with bad guys (the greedy corporation) that are so ridiculous that it was a joke.A more realistic future would be one where the government was led by a committee (we'll call it the Berwick Committee instead of the ""Union"") that decided who lived and who died, and what procedures would be covered by government-provided coverage that you were required to pay into. Of course the Berwick Committee would have much better coverage and wouldn't have to worry about the same coverage and life and death issues as the rest of society. What a movie that would be."
1,Uhmmm...where they do that at?,"OMG this movie was unbearably horrid. I was so distracted while watching this. Distracted by Forrest Whitaker's wandering/lazy eye as well as Jude Laws disappearing hairline. And believe me that baby's hairline was doing some mad disappearing acts. He looks like the white version of Peabo Bryson round about the head. But as for the film all I can say is no Ma'am!! Did not want and/or need this hot baked hard boiled mess of a film. The acting was weak, plot was all over the place and they could have kept the bad dialog and lighting to themselves. Would rather lay under a guillotine and face execution than watch this again or better yet would have rather had my gallbladder removed w/o anesthesia than watch this again. Sorry this movie was not the business."
3,Not much suspense,"Agree with the other reviewer that the background of Tom and Angel are just too unrealistic.Also I mistook this romance book for a suspense story, and that's probably what made me feel disappointed: there is little suspense in it. Other than that, it's an ok paperback to kill time with."
4,More than just a beach read,"This is a fun very sexy mystery/romance. Angel is a tough-talking, spike-heeled wearing private eye. Tom is an ex-alligator wrestler (!!) and new millionaire. Both of them are interested in Holt Hudson, a recluse who has offered Angel the use of his mansion and the auction of his late wife's jewelry for her Altzheimer's Charity Gala. Tom has recently discovered that Holt is actually his godfather though the man refuses to speak to him.This could be a fluff story, but the families of each of the protagonists figure in key ways that give this book a little more weight than you'd expect.Very good, a cut above the average beach book!"
2,Out of Date,"While the cover for this book says 'Updated' and is labeled 12th edition, it appears to be a 2002 printing of a 1990 copyrighted texted. It describes the use of GPS briefly and refers to 'when it works, it is okay'. Obviously the comment predates the bombing raids on Bagdad. The description of harbors is little changed from a 1978 printing but having visited some of these harbors in 2004, I found the names, phone numbers and parts of the onshore facilities' descriptions totally out of date. I returned mine...hope you find a more up-to-date reference."
2,Insufficient Perforation and Only One Glossy Side,"I've purchased the product several times and in the past I would have given it 5 stars.However, this latest shipment was a bit different from past ones. The card don't separate well in the latest shipment; the perforations don't seem deep enough. Also, one side is glossy/plastic and it peels where the perforations aren't complete.So, the last shipment is almost unacceptable. The prior were excellent. My rating of 2 stars is a compromise."
1,Worst I ever heard,Either the recording was botched or the musicians are so avant-garde that I have no idea what message they are trying to convey. It really sounds like the CD was made from a tape going the wrong speed!
5,Worth watching...several times.,"Great well rounded approach to revealing the issues with the Sad American Diet. Combines some footage and topics covered in several other great films, but adds the element of the skeptic ""carnivores"" who are presented with reality. I thought it had a lot of vital information for a critical problem in our country and society."
5,Eye Opening!,I wish i had watched this movie a few years ago... funny thing? i was thinking that i might go vegetarian but once i would feel hungry i would change my mind... not anymore!
5,I am now Vegucated,Loved it and highly recommend it. Am now more Vegucated than I was before and am preparing for a Vegan lifestyle.
5,A Movie Everyone Should See,"Everyone, regardless of dietary choices, should see this film. It follows three average Americans from different walks of life; a college student, a bachelor, and a single working mother, for six weeks of trying a vegan diet. It covers a lot of different aspects, health, social, and enviromental issues. I also like that it covers fish, which a lot of people don't think is bad, and a lot of so-called ""vegetarians"" continue to eat. I know when I first went vegetarian, I had to phase different items out of my diet, I just couldn't completely switch overnight, and fish was the last thing I gave up.I also like the message at the end that even if you don't continue eating a completely vegan diet that you can still do something rather then nothing."
5,So well done,"Not only is this topic something I feel passionately about, but the documentary itself is extremely enlightening. The production value is first-rate and they structured it in such a way that they were able to diffuse the heavy nature of the topic into something palatable. It doesn't come off as preachy or evangelical, but educated and informed. Highly recommended!"
2,They forgot that great humanitarian and vegetarian ...,"Adolph Hitler. Most of his victims were non-violent people. (WOW! did I just prove Godwin's law first?)IMPORTANT POINT -- We'd all be a lot better off eating far less meat and fat. I suggest you do it. [My own BP, weight & cholesterol are admirable.] See, I can be a real pain in the ass, just like this movie.Other than the excellent point about eating less crap, the film is a crock."
5,Very informative and like a reality show (in a good way)!,"This movie explored many issues about being vegan and used every day people and it was fun to guess whether they would stay vegan or not, as time went by. At first I was worried it would be too amateurish, but it became entralling. I think this movie is great for someone who knows nothing about the subject - a thorough introduction."
2,Not as Described,"I was intrigued by this film thinking that it would be about ""normal"" people making the transition to veganism. How they adjusted to the food? What they found to be good substitutes? How they felt, etc. etc.Instead I got a lot of stories/videos about how animals are harmed in the processing of food. It wasn't helpful at all.Ironically, the film starts by trying to dispel the stereotype of vegans....however, this film just perpetuates it."
2,Less health conscious and more anti meat,"I was expecting to watch a documentary about the benefits of a vegan lifestyle and instead found myself watching a documentary concentrating on the inhumanity of producing meat products. I was looking for the former and not the latter. Their examples of meat production included a slaughterhouse from 1979, so I couldn't take the film seriously. While I doubt producing meat ""protein"" products is an overly humane process, I also seriously doubt the examples provided in this film are representative of the norm.Unfortunately, I have to rate this film low. If they had spent more time on how a vegan lifestyle is healthier over how eating meat is inhumane, I would have rated this higher and perhaps reduced my meat intake. I'm not at the end of my investigation, but this film provided me very little insight to influence my opinions of eating meat."
3,"alright, but very amateur","Some good information, but most of the time, just annoying. Crying about not eating meat, etc. Most of the information, people already know."
2,Veducated lacks professionalism,The photography is very amateurish. The crossover between vegetarian and vegan is blurred. It is more like a high-school project than a movie made for public education.
1,I love vegan documentaries but this is boring to no extent,Had to turn it off. Really couldn't stand it. Hot blond chick gets money to make a documentary and really doesn't have much talent or story-telling ability. End of story.
4,Dont watch unless you are ready to act.,Good documentary. It is a very insightful look into our attitude toward meat and its pervasiveness into our culture. I became a vegetarian immediately after watching this movie and wish I had made the choice earlier in life.
2,eh,"i understand this is someone trying to educate people on their own personal beliefs. all the animal cruelty stuff is sad and really horrible to think about. but some of the messages in the film are ridiculous. for example, it tries to draw some correlation between eating vegan and going to the gym, as if veggie people work out & meat eaters don't? these things are not related. also, it acts like the only way to eat meat is hamburgers and hot dogs and other highly-processed, deep-fried, high-fat preparations... as if eating meat automatically means you only eat the worst kind of foods. once it started exploring the Bible as a resource, i starting tuning out. oh -- and suggesting that the farting of farm animals is contributing to the destruction of the environment? that's where i turned it off."
2,Not as described,"As other reviews have said, it was a very preachy documentary. I was expecting more of a trials and tribulations of people adjusting to a new diet, it was clearly a conversion film. On a personal note, having grown up on a small farm, growing vegetables and raising animals for slaughter, I hate how they use the simple ignorance of the fact that many animals are raised to be slaughtered as a reason to convert. Please take the information on organic farming with a grain of salt too, there is a good deal of misinformation spread in that section of the movie."
5,Loved it - very inspiring,"I have been a vegan for 13 years. I only wish this movie had been out then so I could have pointed friends and family to it when they asked me questions about my choices. I found the film inspirational and well done. I was completely committed to the 3 participants and their journey. Informational, funny, kind, and down to earth. I loved it!"
2,Should be called Veganicated.,"So yes, they do follow these people on their vegan diet, which is better than eating poor animals. But they were not Vegecated. When did they teach them to eat a HEALTHY diet including mostly plants? You can eat french fries, potato chips, fried zucchini and vegan chocolate, but you sure aren't healthy. I think the emphasis should have been put on truly Vegecating (like Forks over knives or Fat, Sick & nearly dead). Teach them to eat VEGETABLES and FRUITS."
5,Wow. Great information!!,"I thought this was a very informative movie. Parts of the movie were disturbing, but that's ok because it was the truth."
2,Blah,"Im not one for preachy docs, the film maker butting in to get her mug in every shot is a bit distracting. Just kinda blah overall. THere are better docs on the subject"
4,Finally a Plebian Piece,"Perhaps a film called ""Vegucated"" about the trials of three want-to-vegans (and each successfully so in their own way) isn't 'balanced' but it is tasteful. This film is apparently lightly-funded but so is it avoidant of the heavy-handed production of many films. It's refreshing to see a first-person perspective from doubters coming to the expected and archetypal views that are forced in other films.It's a good film for vegans and staunch carnivores alike as it offers facts and reality, not figures and protest."
3,Interesting,"This was an interesting documentary, but as someone who watches many documentaries I didn't find it as informative as some I have watched in the past. I would recommend it for anyone considering becoming a vegan as it was interesting."
5,Very informative and friendly,"I loved how this documentary was made. It has everything you need to know about how to approach being vegan and the reasons behind it. It shows real people making the switch and learning about veganism in the process, as well as the struggles and triumphs as they deal with the change.I also think there's a good, unbiased balance of both the health aspect and ethical aspect of being vegan. Definitely worth watching several times!"
2,Preach to the choir and they'll give 5-Stars,"Vegucated is getting tremendous reviews from those already Vegan, but what purpose is in that?The first minutes are entertaining (although self promotional by the director/star), but the film can't decide whether to be an ""eat healthy"" or ""animal rights"" film. The eat healthy parts are good at showing the benefits, not necessarily the drawbacks. The animal rights parts drops quickly in to calling people on the phone and asking deep questions such as ""do the chicks get to see their mothers? (should have edit that one out).As mentioned in previous reviews, you really need two movies. One should be on the eat healthier, which could more seriously discuss the challenges of eating Vegan (besides taste). The other should be on animal farm practices, with responsible questions about the challenges of moving to that system.Eat healthy and exercise. And don't get hit by a bus."
2,Does not vegucate.,"I was hoping to learn about how to be a vegan, the nutritional and health benefits. Shopping , cooking, fast food - basically how one exists as a vegan. Not so much, in this film. This was more along the lines of ""look how mean they are to these poor animals"" type of film. Dramatic, but no ""vegucation""."
2,do your research on soy,"If health is your goal, do your research on soy products. Limit your exposure if, for no other reason than... 90% of soy grown in the United States is genetically modified."
3,A great starting point,"This documentary is a great starting point for anybody who is interested in becoming a vegan or vegeterian. I thought this documentary was going to be tremendously boring, however, I was quite surprised at how interesting and informative it was. Very entertaining."
2,"Some truth, mostly bad advice","This movie will unravel the lies about the treatment of animals that are raised for meat and dairy products. There are several scenes that are difficult to watch. I wish the film had more information about the various nutrients that different fruits and vegetables provide. There is also a bit of bad advice given in this film; just because oreos and dunkin heins frosting are vegan products does not mean they are healthy. The same thing goes for soy; there have been studies that question its health benefits. For anyone looking to go vegan do your research, avoid processed foods, exercise, and seek guidance from other people."
2,Go watch Forks Over Knives instead,"Let me start this review by saying that I am a vegan, animal rights activist. I disliked this documentary so much! It was annoying, came across as poorly made and really was heavy handed with the slaughter house footage. This video would turn most non-vegans off instead of opening their eyes. I'd recommend people watch Forks Over Knives, Fat Sick and Nearly Dead, and Food Inc, as well as read Skinny Bitch or Eating Animals as these all do what Veducated wished to do. I was so disappointed with this film! There was a lot of hype over this film and I expected so much more."
3,"Instead of converted, turned off.","I sat down expecting more recognition of the difficulties of switching to being vegan and the expense of switching to a vegan diet- which was not well addressed in this film. In addition, I agree with some other reviews that the depictions of animal slaughter were unexpected and super violent-to the extent that I ended up fast forwarding though them. I enjoyed the characters that were chosen and their personal experiences; however the heavy amount of material clearly pushing veganism and the unexpectedly graphic material made me distrust the film. I have seen other films that left me wanting to eat better and be more conscious in my choices, such as those suggested by other reviewers of this film. They were far more uplifting and made me want to change my diet far more that this film. I would also add, many of the suggested vegan foods concentrated on overly packaged meat and sweet substitutes instead of healthy vegetables, beans, and grains."
2,"Preachy and derivative, I turned it off","I've been digging a lot of vegetarian documentaries lately, and I though this would be another good one that discusses the virtues of plant based diets from a nutritional angle, but it descended into cheeky, sanctimonious, and trite college campus style fringe vegan social theory rather quickly.I suffered through this coming of age crap because I thought the premise, improving the health of skeptics with a vegetable diet, was interesting. But in the first week of their ""experiment,"" virtually the first thing the subjects did was go to a supermarket and start fawning over all their animal-free, supposedly ""vegan"" junk food options like Oreos, and the protagonist made no effort to derail this gluttonous senselessness. At this point, I deleted the movie from my Tivo and turned on the Washington Nationals. It was about 10 minutes in. Watch Forks Over Knives instead, or Fat, Sick, and Nearly Dead."
4,interesting,"It was interesting enough to watch till the end but focused more on the people than the message, Don't eat animal products and how to go about that"
4,thought provoking,"I was glad to find this movie available on amazon prime watch it now, because I'd been interested in seeing it for awhile. I thought it was overall a well put-together documentary with a good message. Although I do think animal cruelty is an important factor in veganism, I wish the film maker would've focused a little more on hard data and statistics associated with a plant based diet and how it benefits overall health and the environment. Some people respond really well to the stark animal cruelty images, but other people may just feel manipulated by them. Again, though, it was a good documentary with a good message."
3,Very interesting video. Of course there is always more to the story.,The more we are removed from the arena of mere survival the more we can chose to eat what is good for us. Unfortunately Americans like meat. I would like to understand more about the the future and the projected supply and demand for beef.
1,"Very one sided, no indepth study on becoming vegan","Totally disappointed! I, too, thought this would be ""educational"" for people thinking of becoming vegetarian or vegan. But, no, it turned out to be an ""amusing"" harangue on the livestock industry. And, you are right, no citation of sources! Then, to bash small farming, organic practices and everything else in between! Has she visited CSAs who raise livestock for the farmers markets? No! Has she researched modern livestock handling in the newer processing facilities? No. Has she read/researched Dr. Temple Grandin regarding humane livestock handling? No. If this was a college project I would grade it F. I am not naive and understand that there occurs some inhumane practices but to paint all of the industry as cruel is dishonest to say the least. The consumer needs to do research to locate certified humane practices and get to know your local farmers markets and CSAs. I sure am!"
1,"oreo cookies, lol","to be fair i maybe watched 20 minutes of this poorly made, manic narrative of a documentary... glad to know i missed the animal cruelty part, because any giggle about people revolutionizing their diet with Teddy Grahams and root beer would not have been worth sitting through scenes of torture. this movie is so NOT about health, or nutrition."
1,Trash,"Yes, there are many health benefits to eating vegetables.But there also are health benefits to eating meat.Factory farming is terrible and produces compromised meat.Buy meat from a local meat market instead.The meat is healthier, tastier, and you won't be supporting factory farms."
4,Gave me quite a Vegucation,I really like the movie and how the study was done with random everyday people. It made me realize even I change change my bad habits.
5,Very well done,"Really opened my eyes. Really need people to get over the idea of vegans and vegetarians as counter culture people. Its about health, and well being."
3,Could Have Been Better,"As opposed to Forks Over Knives and Sick, Fat and Nearly Dead, this documentary didn't do enough to educate the viewer on the challenges, options and health benefits of going vegan or vegetarian. Focusing less on the health issues and more on the farming and animal rights issues, the movie probably emphasized the wrong message to get the ""typical"" viewer to consider the switch. The ""what is in it for me"" is missing, and the focus on ""others"" primarily makes the message a tougher sell.Interesting content, and would like to know where the three end up today, and whether they have been able to stay the course - both from a health and lifestyle perspective. There are better choices along this topic line, as mentioned above, but it wasn't a waste of time."
2,Veganism documentary that is thinly veiled PETA ad. Go watch Forks over Knives,"If you must watch this I would say watch teh first half and turn it off, as soon as you hit the horrorifying slaughter house footage, its downhill.This could have been a really powerful wonderful documentary but instead decided to be over the top Peta ad.All the hidden footage of animals in slaughter houses are not given enough context.Go watch Forks over Knives you will learn more."
2,meh,"I was hoping to like this, as I am a supporter of a plant-based diet.A) Unfortunately, the editing of the documentary seems to be following the worn out formula of Super-Size-Me. This gets tedious. Could use some originality and style.B) If a primary point of the documentary is to introduce people to a healthy diet, extolling the virtues of ""tofurky"" and the various other frankenstein factory creations seems antithetical to your point. Yes, they are vegan, but you'd likely be better off eating meat. I don't buy the argument that eating fake meat is a gateway to no meat.At this point I turned off the movie."
2,eh...,"somewhat informative, but hugely one sided. it was more about animal rights than healthful eating. maybe duncan hines frosting is ""vegan"" because it contains no animal products, but it's loaded with other garbage that should be left on the shelf. there's absolutely nothing healthy about it. oreos? really? this was not vegucational. it made me sad about our modern farming practices, but didn't inspire much into vegan practices. if you're interested in learning about food and how it actually affects your body, start with reading the omnivore's dilemma."
2,"Vegetarian, but not for this movie","While I agree with most of the ideas in this film, I think the way the ideas were conveyed contribute to the bad rap that my type of lifestyle gets.Appealing to logic is always a higher road than appealing to emotion."
5,very powerful documentary,"My husband and I were very much influenced by this documentary. I think everyone should see it. I would say its a MUST-see. Great job,Vegucated! Let's vegucate the world!"
1,Vegucated is very uneducated,This movie is an extreme in-your-face movie as to why you shouldn't eat meat. The movie gives all the wrong reasons as to why you shouldn't eat meat. The movie shows peoples reactions to how animals are processed or a few of them getting injured in the process and it shows the people crying. I'm going to assume people have never seen a butcher slaughter an animal or cut the neck off of a chicken in order to humanly kill it for eating.That's my main issue with this movie; it wants you to think that killing animals for food is inhumane and torture. It also finds extreme cases of hurt animals being abused to make you think it's like that for all animals. The stupidest part was the lady calling someone on the phone and asking them questions about bulls and chickens.
1,Not based on fact,"I stopped watching this as soon as they claimed the chicken we buy are genetically modified. This is absolutely untrue, as they are ""created"" by cross-breeding two varieties of chicken. If they are blatantly stating misinformation as fact in this case, I have to assume they do elsewhere in the video as well. I am tired of ""foodies"" labeling everything they disagree with as a GMO."
1,PETA-type Propoganda Film,"It only uses a little bit about vegan diet to decieve viewers into watching a PETA-type film. It's more about animal cruelty, blah, blah, blah. The girl Tesla was a very immature, uneducated (and quite annoying) girl who could be led to believe anything. There are much better films out there if you are interested in a vegan diet."
2,economy holster...,"The holster is functional. It doesn't seem to fit any revolver exactly right. I have tried it with several Smiths, a Colt .38, and my Ruger GP100. As indicated by the product pic with the blue gun, the trigger and trigger guard hang out of the holster rather awkwardly. Not really a safety issue so much as a fit issue. Would be great for kid's toy gun but not practical to actually carry a 2+ pound handgun securely."
4,A good fit for the Nagant revolver.,Purchased this for a Nagant revolver and it fits great. So far so good! I would recommend to anyone looking for a cheap holster option for a Nagant.
3,Good holster - MUCH smaller than pictured!,"Was looking for a holster for a larger revolver, like the one in the picture - this barely fit my S&W .38 special... It is a good holster, my wife will use it - but if you go with what you see depicted you'll be disappointed. Do the homework on the size mentioned and ignore the misleading pictures here."
3,revised review on Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna,Gospel of Sri RamakrishnaI am revising my review as the vender refunded us 15% of our purchase price and tried to be helpful. Please be sure the quality of pictures and print is up to snuff before purchasing. I had a problem with these areas and the pages sticking together. The book binder cover is the best quality and it is my hope that the rest of the book will meet this high standard. Perhaps it will be improved in the future and the pictures included will be real black and white printing instead of a redish tint.But they did respond and gave me a %15 credit for these problems. I am hoping the beautiful teachings of Ramakrishna will be presented in a beautiful quality printing job and book in the future. Perhaps this review can help a little.
5,Outstanding!,"Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna is simply a great work. Based on a journal maintained by one of Ramakrishna's ardent disciples, this is truly a jewel. Credit must also go to Swami Nikhilananda for masterful translation. This 1000 page classic with densely packed text would have been a challenge to read if not for the wisdom and the way the wisdom is presented.It's been so well journaled that it's like getting into a time machine and going back in time to around 1870s to Bengal and meeting spiritual giants such as Ramakrishna, Vivekananda. This book has so much reference to Narendra who went on to become Swami Vivekananda. Here we get to see how Narendra evolved and what challenges he faced.All in all a great classic and readable anytime. Wish it was typecast in little bigger font and spaced out better."
3,Cute little doy toy!,I purchased this for my two miniature dachshunds. They chewed the paws off of it but the rest has stayed in good shape. They like it and play with it frequently. It's a nice size for them. It's very soft!
2,"Squeaker died within minutes, but toy is cute looking","Not asking for a refund or a return as I purchased this via the four-for-three promotion and I'll just regard this as the free item. SO cute looking. I don't know how, without making any rips, the squeaker was silenced under five minutes by my fairly wild playing male Yorkshire Terrier and dwarf Australian Cattle Dog. But it is now mute. Cute but mute. I get enough good deals from Amazon to not elect to bother with replacing this one but I think for some reason maybe not all the squeakers are that durable. The sewing seems okay though."
1,My Boston Terrier ripped it within a day,"Cute toy, but my dog ripped a giant hole in it within the first day. The squeker lasted though. Not very durable. So far NANCO has made the best dog toy I have found.This might be better suited for a toy type of breed."
3,"Cute, well made, but my little dog isn't too interested.","This toy is adorable and really well made, but my miniature pinscher doesn't seem too interested in it. She will play with it, but she has more fun with her smaller toys."
5,"A new version of the ""Bible"" of Demography","I remember the early days where I used to go through the old book ""The Methods and Materials of Demography"" while studying at the Cairo Demographic Center in the early 90s of last century. The new version is an innovative and invaluable addition to the fundamental books in the field. I highly recommend this book for all demographers worldwide."
3,too many repeats,"Said this before: I love Jeane Manson's singing, but the problem is whenever you buy one of these CDsthey simply contain too many songs that already happen to be on other CDs by this singer. The French seem to be in the habit of putting out records in this manner. Why?About the only bummer here: a third of the songs are also on the other three Jeane Manson CDs that I own.Skip this one, and get En Public. It's a double disk live concert set: one is a CD, the other a DVD. I gave that one five stars."
1,This episode gets a D grade and is ranked 77th out of 80,"When the U.S.S. Enterprise finds that all the adults in the Starnes expedition to Triacus have killed themselves, they beam to the planet's surface to investigate. The children, however, are alive and well and strangely oblivious to their parents' fates. They are beamed aboard the U.S.S. Enterprise while Kirk searches for an answer to the strange occurrences. The children summon their ""friendly angel"" Gorgan, who tells them to take the U.S.S. Enterprise to a planet he can control. By garbling Kirk's words and deceiving Spock, the children are able to take control of the starship. Finally, seeing Kirk's anxiety at the loss of his ship, Spock realizes that something is wrong and helps the Captain regain control. Kirk shows the children tricorder tapes of their parents... and their graves, demonstrating to them that Gorgan is not a ""friendly angel"" but an evil force. The loss of his believers renders Gorgan impotent and he fades into oblivion."
1,Ouuuuch!,"What a horrible dud! this show has gone down in history as one of the most hated shows of the series. I'm sure it was meant to be scary, but the results are dopey. Please, don't make yourself suffer through this mess, and don't torture yourself with attorney Marvin Belli's acting abilities."
5,Love the book!,"Great book for those who love to entertain but don't want to spend a lot of time making a big fuss in the kitchen. Wonderful Recipes. Thank you, Ellen!"
1,"Should be Called ""Vapid and Trite Weekends""","A friend (former) gave me this book and I found it silly and lamentable at best and unswervingly pretentious at worst. I think the author put it best, ""It's not just the food, not just the people, and not just the setting. It is how it all comes together."" This book is embarrassing to write, embarrassing to buy, embarrassing to read. Such vapidness should be kept to oneself and not celebrated as it is here."
2,"Stick to ""Blues tracks"" instead","After a number of albums sounding more or less the same, I have indeed grown tired of Pat Travers. And it's not just because he's doing the same thing over and over - the quality in material have become rather weak over the years. ""Blues tracks"" from 1992 may be Travers first real attempt on power blues and he did it very well indeed. After that, things have gone downhill with the exception of ""Blues magnet"" in 1994. But albums like ""Just a touch"" (1993) and ""Halfway to somewhere"" (1995) isn't really exciting, and ""Looking up"" from 1996 isn't good at all (primary due to lack of good material). But die hard fans, who can't get enough of this kind of repetitive blues will perhaps find pleasure in this release."
3,Not Enough Detail,"Novotny's book is good, but too short. He only touches briefly on topics and he left me wanting more."
3,"The Good Soldier: From Austrian Social Democracy to Communist Captivity with a Soldier of Panzer-Grenadier Division ""Grossdeutsc","Novotny's memoires are written from a survivor's perspective and thus adds sociological as military historical interest. Like ""Band of Brothers,"" ""The Good Soldier"" recounts life inside an elite unit and the contrast in equipment, rationing , and mobility contrast starkly with the accounts from ordinary Wehrmacht landsers. Novotny's Austrian youth forms a valuable snapshot of life after Anschluss while his observations on combat attrition of Germany's elite ""fire brigades"" and the subsequent poor quality of post-1943 replacement troops are telling. The image of a technologically and racially superior division overwhelmed by Russian untermenchen is common among such veterans, as is the total seeming ignorance of the work of the Einsatzgruppen. From Prokhorovka to Peoria, Nolvotny's life resounds with adventure if not insight."
1,The Usual Dreck,"Yet another WWII German soldier account utterly devoid of responsibility for starting the war, or any of the horror they caused in attacking other countries, and what is told is told poorly. Not really a disappointment, since I expected this crap from other such accounts I have suffered through."
5,Recall of WWII in Austria,"Reading Alfred Novotny's ""The Good Soldier"" brought back memories of my days living in Austria's economic depression in the 1930's, followed by seven years of Nazism and finally, nearly ten years of Soviet Communist occupation. Mr. Novotny's book drove home a realism that was all around me then. After such a long time we tend to forget the bad experiences of life, which is probably good. And yet, there is a danger in becoming complacent instead of assuring that for all of human kind they must not recur. I wish to thank Mr. Novotny for his brilliant account of what pain war inflicts and how only a few have the strength to survive it. Excellent reading to teach all of us that war is not an alternative."
3,Brief Encounter,"Alfred Novotny has led a truly extraordinary life, one well worth putting to print. His life before the war, during the war, and after the war could easily have been broken up into three interesting volumes, or made into one very long book. What the reader gets, however, is a long magazine article disguised as a book. Filled with large print and pictures this undersized book falls short because of what it should have been and is not. His battle with a Russian tank is just one of many examples. The encounter is told in a sentence or two, leaving the reader wanting and disappointed. It is not an exaggeration to say that most readers could finish this ""book"" while waiting at the doctor's or dentist's office. That makes the price a little too high."
4,"Typical Von Sternberg-Dietrich thing, w/ Anna Karenina-ish","plot... Blonde Venus is a story with a typical love triangle: a beautiful wife, who gave up her career for marriage, a decent but not very fascinating husband, and Cary Grant as a lover [you get the picture here]. But this film is not all clear-cut, e.g. husband is not completely dull, lover is not completely ruthless, and the wife....well, the wife is Marlene Dietrich, which in itself is not typical. It is surreal, to see her as a devoted mother and a wife. Dietrich performs some great stage numbers, but still manages to look ""motherly"" in couple of shots.Blonde Venus is definitely a Marlene Dietrich vehicle, with occasional long shots of young Cary Grant [simply standing there and being absolutely gorgeous]. Dialogue is very good, even touching at times. Oh, yes, you really get to see Dietrich in gorilla costume.All in all, this film is not overly cheesy, despite its trivial melodramatic plot."
4,Mug for the Camera!,"Hey, I love this movie. I continue to be totally fascinated by the 'Hot Voodoo' number, with Marlene wearing a blonde afro wig--surrounded by Cotton Club dancers (notice the one who turns back-and-forth opposite of everyone else during the 2nd chorus!), and Dickie Moore is one of the most adorable child actors of all time. But Marlene's mugging is hilarious! She mugs more than Prince does in 'Purple Rain'! Too funny!One thing I found very interesting...we rarely see Marlene's famous gams in the movie! Very disappointing."
2,ok,"First of all these CDs claim to be original recordings from THE JUDY GARLAND SHOW (1963-1964 on CBS-TV). SOME of them are. There are also a number of studio tracks with and without applause added. Of the tracks which ARE from the show some have canned applause added to ""enhance"" them and many are reproduced at the wrong speed. The fidelity of the recordings is also extremely variable. Pass this one by and go out and get THE JUDY GARLAND SHOW on DVD. The sounds and images found there are fabulous and do justice to Judy's legacy."
4,Prints fine,"As non-OEM ink goes, this seems to do the job. Blacks seems to smudge a little, but so did the original."
5,Satisfactory Product,"We have encountered no problems. These ink cartrides were purchased for my wife's printer, which is not used to print photographs. Thusfar, these cartridges have worked well and offer considerable savings. For generic use, highly recommended."
1,3 out of 4 Defective ??? Big Problem Here!,"Based on Most of the Reviews, I ordered 2 Packages...giving me four of each Color.Good thing since 3 out of the four Cyan Cartridges that I had to open were defective!One had a broken retention tab and could not be used. Two others were leaking into the plastic packaging!Did have one good one out of the lot and the test page I printed looked good.So let's hope they are replaced by the vendor without delay... and we'll see how it goes.I will update the review and let you know."
3,BJ color ink,Color sucks. B&W is great. Just don't print with these because the color is so off and not good...its even worst when printing on photo paper...
1,Garbage!!!,"Total waste of money. I bought this set of ink hoping to have some backup if I run out of my original Canon ink. What a crap!!! On box they put sign ""Ink made in Germany"", they claming compatibility to even CLI-8 series, but who cares if it DOES NOT fit!!! It actually fits, but not fully locked in. If you take original Canon and this garbage, you can see right away that difference in locking lever is 1/8-3/16 causing this ink to be not fully placed in your printer head. I was hoping to use it in my Canon PixmaIP4000. DO NOT BUY!!!!!"
5,A Geologists Relates,"Oddly enough, I was far from home doing field work in North Georgia when I found Oil Notes in a little bookstore. I am a geologist. However, unlike Rick Bass my job was to look for fresh drinking water, not oil. I found time to read his book between logging boreholes and setting wells. By the time I was finished I (with the book) I had a renewed interest and spirit in my profession and in the environment around me. Rick Bass found a way to express in words, the excitement and passions associated with being a field geologist, environmentalist and a man in love.Oil Notes is a fantastic book, and Rick Bass is an equally outstanding author. I have since read everyone of his books. He vividly defines his feelings and passions in everything he writes about, be it drilling for oil or studing wolves."
3,"Nice Narrative, Nice Bias","Rick Bass's little oil book, originally published in 1989, is a good read for those who know something about oil production. But it is dated, very badly, by recent developments in the energy sector. One of his ""notes"" -- page 19 of the SMU edition -- states ""I hate coal."" This goes to two pages of nonsense written by someone years ago, like me, that could not have anticipated the significance of coalbed methane.If you read this book, realise it is from a well-head mentality. This oil genius probably has never spent a day underground or a minute to understand why we must mine coal. Perhaps he could run his word processor off the crude pumped into a generator adjacent to his office. That's a patent I'd like to see."
2,Not necessary...,"Just forgive me that simple sentence: ""If you have IN BLUE SPECIAL EDITION, it's a waste to buy it"" - because all those track you can find on the album..."
3,Not as irresistible as it seems,"Okay, I assumed the Corrs rushd this CD single because the B sides or bonus tracks (however you would like to call it) are not really the best. First of all, ""Irresistible"" is a great song perfectly produced by Mutt Lange. The B sides ""Somebody For Someone"" and ""At Your Side"" are not as good as the version on the album therefore it would be better off getting the album instead. Overall, ""Irresistible"" is great but if you want to get this CD for just the song, I recommend you get the ""Give Me A Reason"" single instead because ""Irresistible"" is also on it."
1,They should have stopped the press before it ran out of ink.,"This is a terrific history, especially for someone like me who grew up in Park Forest and has personal familiarity with the village and its people. Unfortunately, the book they sent to me must have been the last one off the press. The ink on the even-numbered pages was barely visible. So I read the odd-numbered pages and got half the story. As Mom always said: ""Half a loaf is better than none."""
3,"nice format, needs update","Like other reviewers said, much of the information is outdated, but I like what the book tried to do: collect both baseball and nonbaseball information in one volume. The 'closest major league city' section are a nice touch for someone planning a road trip, and the top ten lists scattered throughout the book are a nice touch"
2,Dreams? A Trance Is More Like It.,"Not a very entertaining or informative book. Also, a lot of the information is outdated."
2,Outdated information,"I agree with some other reviewers. Much of the information in this book is seriously outdated. As a native Chicagoan, I was surprised to see that the China Club was listed as a hot spot. Well, I hate to break it to you, but the club doesn't exist anymore. As a matter of fact, the China Club was turned into residential lofts at least 3 years ago! Overall, this is an adequate reference guide, but double check your info before embarking on a trip."
3,"Good book, could have been better","In response to one of the earlier reviews, I have also read ""Dodger Dogs to Fenway Franks"" and found it to be a much better book. Fields of Dreams definitely has entertainment value and is fun to look through, but hardly a ground-breaking or thought-provoking publication. Most dissapointing was a disturbing number of flaws and factual errors in the book. I counted four errors alone in the section on the history of Toronto's SkyDome, including an incorrect year on when the stadium opened and the mention that Joe Carter's series-winning homer in game six of the 1993 World Series ""prevented the Series from returning to Philadelphia for a seventh game."" Every baseball fan should know that when you're in one town for game six, you stay there for game seven--- this isn't the NHL playoffs. Overall, I got some enjoyment out of this book, but the errors and the fact that I had seen this topic treated better before detracted from it."
5,MAE,An excellent movie. A true classic. Very suspenseful. It's great to be able to watch these old movies. Grace Kelly was an amazing actress as well as the rest of the cast. A must see.
4,Not In My Back Yard,"An old dog professsional photographer temporarily bed ridden (due to an accident)(James Stewart). A junior socialite (Grace Kelly) looking to get hitched to old dog photographer. A back yard full of troubled `lonely crowd' urban neighbors in 1950's New York. Bring in a salesman (Raymond Burr) neighbor (could it be Willie Loman going off the edge) in an unhappy marriage. Add in the master suspense director Alfred Hitchcock and you have the making of a classic suspense thriller. The plot revolves around the clues picked up by Stewart as he, out of boredom or otherwise, hones in on the apartment across the way. By the time Stewart and crew are done old Raymond Burr is going to need more than Perry Mason to get out of this fix. A word on Grace Kelly. They say Prince Rainer of Monaco, her husband, a man not known for showing emotion openly cried when she died in that car accident long ago. Now I know why. Enough said."
4,One of Hitchcock's best,"This movie is full of suspense, and yet is fun and entertaining. Grace Kelly is superb, as is Thelma Ritter. Raymond Burr is good as the killer even though its an unusual part for him. James Stewart as the journalist with the broken leg who sits and watches everyone in his apartment complex, plays an excellent part. It's a wonderful movie. Sad -- full of suspense -- and entertaining all in one."
5,Why aren't they rereleasing this movie?!!,"This is one of the first Hitchcock movies I saw. After I saw it I ran to the movie staore to buy it. To my dismay it is out of print! Why aren't they rerealesing this wonderful movie? I am mostly angry at the people who are rerealesing his other films(Natorious, Lifeboat, Spellbound and another favorite of mine Rebbeca) and not this one! They were smart enough to realese those movies. I wish they would put it on video! Well you movie reviewers now know that I LOVE this film and its a movie that everyone should see!"
5,Rear Window,"One of the most celebrated films in history, this classic takes its time, but once the tension starts building, it doesn't stop until the heart-pounding conclusion is upon you. A new peak for Hitchcock in blending the story of a crime that may have happened with the dark side of human obsession--in this case, voyeurism. The movie marks a high point for James Stewart, who would be remembered as Hitchcock's most human and vulnerable hero. And who can resist the bewitching Grace Kelly?"
5,I never tought spying on neighbors could be so thrilling!,"Rear window is one of my favorite movies ever! James Stuart was superb, along with grace kelly. This movies was a complete success. I watched it because a friend reccomended it to me, but I didn't know he had a good reason for it!"
3,A little slow by modern standards...,"It has taken me a long time to get around to watching Rear Window. Perhaps the wait made me expect too much. Maybe this movie just suffers in my mind because I watched it not long after watching the masterful North By Northwest.Whatever the case, I was left a little underwhelmed.Jimmy Stewart is great, as usual. Grace Kelly is a knockout. I even like the nurse.Yet this movie drags.As I explained to my wife, who fell asleep a half hour in, not much happens. They sit around. They sit around some more.They conjecture.And then--boom. There is an ending. While this movie has all the stylish atmosphere you could want out of a Hitchcock movie, it does not rise the level of a Psycho, Vertigo, or North By Northwest.Rear Window is worth watching. It has some very funny dialogue and a couple of iconic moments. I just don't recommend investing in your own copy unless you are a Hitchcock completist."
2,"No suspense, only boredom...","Compared to psychological thrillers like Psycho and Vertigo, this movie was disappointing at best. Rear Window is very slow and boring, and the audience loses its attention through much of the film. Of course the ending was surprising in typical Hitchcockian fashion, but there was no tension built through the film so the ending was very anti-climatic. However, I still recommend this film...if you want to catch a nice nap."
2,so so,"[WARNING: movies spoilers ahead] Recently I watched Psycho, Vertigo, Rear Window, and The Birds. Out of these four, I only liked Vertigo... the other was not much of anything new, probably due to so many other movies imitating it... but god... even if none did that, can Read WIndow be so highly acclaimed as it is? It feels only like a low budget Hong Kong black and white movie made in two weeks. The plot sucked.Even some re-run of Hitchcock on the TV that is 30 minutes long have more twist and surprise and ending better than The Birds, Psycho, and Rear Window."
3,Good film but often over-rated,"Rear Window is one of those films that tends to be over-rated most of the time. Definately not the best Hitchcock film in my book. The performances of James Stewart and Grace Kelly are wonderful to watch, but the plot is not exceptional. Yes, the film itself is suspensful, but do you want to watch a two hour picture whose subject is a handicapped photographer trying to solve what he thinks is a murder mystery?If you really want to watch Hitchcock's masterpieces, I would recommend Vertigo, Psycho, Rebecca, The Birds and North By Northwest."
1,Boring,"I feel stupid writing the only 1-star review for this movie, but what the heck. I thought Rear Window was boring. It starts off agonizingly slow and I thought it was annoying how all the action takes place in one setting (ala 12 Angry Men). The acting isn't half bad but the film is so slow...I can't imagine anyone wanting to sit through this film more than once. There's my 2 cents. Buy it if you like Hitchcock."
4,Great drama/suspense film.,"Like the Greenwich Village courtyard view from its titular portal, Alfred Hitchcock's classic Rear Window is both confined and multileveled: both its story and visual perspective are dictated by its protagonist's imprisonment in his apartment, convalescing in a wheelchair, from which both he and the audience observe the lives of his neighbors. Cheerful voyeurism, as well as the behavior glimpsed among the various tenants, affords a droll comic atmosphere that gradually darkens when he sees clues to what may be a murder. Definately one of Hitchcocks best, but my favorite is, and always will be Psycho. See it today."
5,the most awesome movie ever!,"this movie is breathtaking and the masterpiece of moviemaking! when i first saw it, i immediately fell in love with it, and in the following months i watched it over a 100 times. every detail is important, every look, every word! and the couple of james stewart and the wonderful grace kelly is undoubtedly magnificent! grace kelly is on her best, like hitchcock said himself ""a surface of ice with a volcano beneath"". she plays with so much witt, humor and coolness at the same time, she catches everyone! and james stewart as the injured photographer plays his part so honestly and charming, you never want to take your eyes of those two. but hitchcock knew how to get everyone's attention, with his great cameramovement, with the dialogue, with just about everything! watch it and love it!"
3,Not my favorite because...,"I LOVE Hitchcock. But perhaps I watched this movie with the wrong expectation. What I expected was a nail-biter. The truth is I only felt nervous/fearful in the last 15 minutes of the movie. It felt long, and the climax was over too quickly. Not a satisfying payoff to all the waiting.It is very interesting as a drama. (Fantastic for watching human behavior and for the little storylines of the neighbors.) As a suspense film, though, not scary enough."
2,Boring and little action,"Boring film. I can't understand how some people might want to sit through the entire movie without wanting to run away from it. It was so boring that I had to pause the movie several times just to ""take a break."" When I finally got through most of it, I was disappointed to find little if any action in the ending. I give it 2 stars because I thought the acting was good. Other than that, I don't see how this movie is a 5 stars."
5,Boy this was awesome on DVD.,"It was probably about 2 a.m. when I woke from this dream. I was watching Rear Window on DVD. It was still the same great movie, but made even better transferred to DVD. The quality even surpassed that of Vertigo remastered. The penguin next to me and some of my old elementary classmates watched the movie also and seemed to enjoy it. Though after the first half hour of the film, I became bothered by the carpet below my feet that transformed into a deep, blue pool of infested shark water. As it turns out, Rear Window is a great movie even when you're sitting next to a penguin and wary of shark attack."
2,How can this be a thriller? Never watch it.,"OK..Alfred Htchcock is a great director but if he makes this movie...Sorry ..I am not seeing any of his movies. storyline is neither romantic nor a thriller. The killer is pretty obvious and in the end so much for the thrill, his intentions nor the plot are even mentioned once. Damn ....what a waste."
1,Rear Window,Item sent was with a German Title and wouldn't play in my DVD player in California. Had to return it. Credit issued promptly.
2,Very bad transfer on Universal Legacy Series,"I purchased Rear Window - The Universal Legacy Series for my wife as it is one of her favorite Hitchcock films. What a dissapointment! The transfer on thie version is jerky and very grainy. After watching this for 10 minutes, we went back to the dvd version we recorded directly from cable TV, and that copy isn't the best, but certainly was better. If I had seen 30 seconds of this copy first, I would have immediatley dismissed it."
5,Classic,"Once again, write a review? Really? Classic Alfred Hitchcock... Will say the same thing about Rebecca, and the rest of his wonderful movies...."
5,A must see!,A great version of this movie - bonus features digitally remastered - exactly as advertised. A Hitchcock classic - a must see!
4,Rear Window,"When I was a child, I got so sick of hearing how brilliant Alfred Hitchcock was. To the extent that I never watched any of his movies, if you can believe it. Well, this one's pretty damn cool. I really don't want to overanalyze all the techniques that our beloved director employed so well, lest I spoil the fun. The plot centers around a question. Did Raymond Burr kill his wife and chop her up with saw and knife? That's the impression injured Jimmy Stewart got from peeping through the windows. We had to throw in some subplots and have some fun as well, because of the length, and it's excellent in doing that. Almost everybody sends up himself or herself a little bit, and we have some laughs in addition to trademark suspense, and it's a great film."
1,The dumbest movie ever,I dont see how anyone could rate this movie 5 stars...the mosthorrible movie ever...There is nothing left to say i dont wanna waste my time talking about this movie.
4,A fantasic movie with okay extras.,"The movie doesn't need reviewing in my opinion. Everyone at least knows about it. It's one of the greatest movies made. Not everyone loves it but most do, and should be on the shelf of anyone who likes classic movies. Not many reviewers comment on the extras. They are decent and are enjoyable enough to watch if you're interested in film. I will say that the hero worship of Hitchcock is still going strong and colors the extra features. Hitchcock was VERY talented but was possibly more master of PR rather than suspense. He did know how to put together a good team, though. A look at the extras onAlfred Hitchcock Presents - Season One(I think this was the one) was much more interesting."
5,a great movie,"I saw this movie for the first time last weekend when it was on Turner Classic Movies. It is terrific! Sometimes it's hard for me to believe these people wouldn't put their blinds down, though they do at some points in the movie. Stewart's character is the ultimate ""nosy neighbor"". The plot is just so fascinating and well done. I also saw ""Vertigo"" for the first time recently, but I definitely like this classic Hitchcock movie better. The story in ""Rear Window"" held my attention; and the climax, for me at least, was much more suspenseful than the climax in ""Vertigo"". I highly recommend this movie!I was curious if anyone else who has watched this movie saw someone who looks like Alfred Hitchcock himself in one scene. It's about 25 minutes into the movie, and this man is in the struggling songwriter's apartment. He has his back to the piano, then turns around. I just wondered if my eyes are playing tricks on me."
5,Love this classis,"If you like Jimmy Stewart, you will love watching this classic movie over and over. It is one of those movies you never tire of. I have watched it many times and each time I catch something that I didn't notice the previous times. Great purchase!"
5,Rear Window,This movie is a classic. I've seen it many times and it's still very suspenseful. I would recommend this to everyone.
3,Made for Europe...,"I did not know that so many companies in this country were selling dvd's from Europe. Lesson learned! Fortunately someone had a player for European dvd's and we were able to play it, but, unfortunately we can't add it to our collection because most patrons do not have that kind of player. :-("
4,GALILEO STEWART?,"When Alfred Hitchcock offered the lead role in this film to Jimmy Stewart in 1954, Stewart was reluctant:""Gee, that didn't seem like much of a part. But, Hitch could do that..create a good film out of next to nothing."" So, Hitchcock paired Stewart with Grace Kelly (old enough to be his daughter) and came up with a gem. which seems to have faded a bit with time. Laid up with a broken leg, Stewart all but rejects his girlfriend, Kelly, preferring to snoop on the neighbors with a pair of binoculars. Just imagine a Matt Damon or a Leo DiCaprio pulling a stunt like this today with a Kate Winslet type, Anyway, Stewart""s reconnaissance missions eventually turn up what he's convinced is a wife murderer; the type that likes to dismember his victim. But our voyeur is having the darndest time convincing police officer Corey until... This is still a very good movie, well worth your time. But time does change one's perspective, especially after 53 years."
5,Great Hitchcock suspense movie,Great Hitchcock suspense movieexcellent actinglots of suspensesome humorexcellent directinga classicStewart and Kelly are handsome and beautiful
5,Dazzling,"Only Hitch could get such a range of mood, light, color, vitality and morbidity out of an enclosed courtyard without a single shot of the sky...."
3,Not remastered,"I bought this DVD together with the ""Vertigo"". Their quality are the same, not remastered.Not enhanced for widescreen Tv of 16:9 Tv."
5,One of Hitch's Top 5 in MHO,"An enjoyable and of course suspense filled film from the master of the genre. A two disc set which contains a load of extras on the second disc any film buff or Hitchcock fan must own this Universal Legacy Series edition.The restoration of this is outstanding the film looks probably better than it ever has and I have seen quite a few versions of this on different formats over the years. I'm sure the plots been explained enough in other reviews so I will just give MHO of this classic. Jimmy Stewart gives a good performance, Grace Kelly as gorgeous as she ever was looks even better restored. The true genius of this is how can you put suspense into a film where a man is confined to a wheelchair the whole film Hitch did. There is a reason Hollywoods remade it twice (once with Christopher Reeves and reimagined as Disturbia) if you have never seen this see it if you have seen it this a beautiful edition and a fine way to find out more about this great film."
4,Watch This One With Lights Off,"The solid and stoic Stewart laid up with nothing but his camera, the classy and lovely Kelly and the wonderfully acerbic Ritter make up a small cast hunkered down in an even smaller world, where everything IS subject to scrutiny. Questions arise when a neighbor exhibits suspect behaviour, but are the actions of the neighborly threesome any less suspect ? A terrific change of pace from modern day slasher films, this shows that suspense is always best when it preys on ones' imagination. Hitchcok scored a big yippee for this jewel !"
2,Rear Window condition of CD,"This is one of Hitchcock's finest suspense dramas and truly delivers in terms of glamour, bravery and suspense, however the condition of the CD was not at its finest. The CD stops and starts at multiple times throughout its viewing and despite wiping it and changing DVD players, it continues to have this problem. In future, would seller please verify that the product is in viewable condition."
5,Rear Window,This is my favorite movie. I was delighted to be able to download it to my Kindle Fire. The quality is excellent.
3,NOT Restored Properly....,"I am a serious collector and when I read these reviews about this special edition ""Newly Restored"" Hitchcock masterpiece I had to have it. Sadly If you mean just tweeking the colors to call it fully restored then it's ok. But this restoration missed the dust and dirt particles that appear through-out this whole movie. White, black dirt all over this thing. Although the attempt was made it should be clarified that this falls very short of a true restoration. Yes the colors are rich and vibrant but one can't help notice the dirt all over it. So just to make it clear it might have been restored but not to the standards given to other restored movies. This edition really needs to be cleaned up. Hence the 3 stars instead of 5... as a truly restored movie would get."
2,A lot of build up with very little pay off.,"I didn't really care for this movie and I don't think it belongs in AFI's top 100 movies. The acting is definitely the best part of this movie. I mean you can't really go wrong with Jimmy Stewart and Grace Kelly. But It is not enough to make this a good movie in my opinion. I believe this movie is shot all from one room. The movie is mostly dialogue between Stewart and whomever is in his room at the time. During the times where there is no dialogue the camera is panning into the other windows of the courtyard. Stewart really doesn't have much evidence to go on but he is convinced one of his neighbors killed his own wife. The movie builds and builds until we find out he is right. There are no twists, He and his girlfriend are threatened twice but it's really not that threatening. I think it's a good idea but Hitchcock missed on this one."
4,clever!,"Great dialogue, Stewart as the chair-bound reporter observing life as it occurs outside his ""rear window"", in the alley below and also through the windows of the opposing apartment complex....does he observe a murder? We do not know, and neither does he, it does make for great suspense, kelly is fun as his girlfriend, too!"
4,Looking at the big picture,"My partners and I read the E-Myth Physician after reading the E-Myth Revisited. The concepts and systemization of our company have significantly changed our practices in the last year. After looking at some of the other reviews I noticed a common theme, people either love the book or hate it. Those who were not pleased with the book all have another common theme in that they did not feel it offered any ""practical"" solutions to their problems. That point of view absolutely supports Gerber's idea of the ""technition"" working in the business and not working on the business. I would not recommend this book for people looking for quick solutions to daily problems in their practice, but if you want to change your practice and the way you look at your business it is an excellent addition to the E-Myth series."
2,Not a great book,"I agree with Dan who posted a review 2 posts before me. I am a physician and have read a few of Gerbers books. His Emyth revisited is a good book. However, his other books such as this one which is supposed to be geared towards specific profession. He only gives you some very basic concepts that offer really no solutions to these problems. I think most of us who understand our problems wish to have some questions answered and get help solving them not just simply reiterate what we already know. He does an absolute poor job on the money section of the book even though he implies that it is one of the most important aspects of the business. It is a terrible book on application to problem solving. Emyth even though does not necessarily cover application all the way either but it gives more useful hints than this one.Organization: C-Application: FUsefulness: FRe-read: FOverall: D-"
3,Not the greatest business book I've ever read,"After reading this book I was a bit conflicted over what rating to give it. Yes, there is insightful information in the book, but it only takes up two pages. The rest of the text is the typical motivational style found in other business books. It's the ""You can succeed"" attitude that I find obnoxious. For what it's worth, the premise of ""E-Myth"" is that doctors should have a set form for the practice -- that the office should run more like McDonald's than the traditional idea that everything revolves around the physician's meeting with the patient. Practices should divide tasks among the staff -- such as letting the techs take care of the initial physical -- while the doctors worry about only matters which actually require an M.D."
2,Not Enough!,"The author seems to partly grasp the challenges (i.e. managed care, cash flow, office staff, family life, etc.) of a being a physician. However, he offers no practical solutions to help overcome these challenges. Changing one's ""mindset"" is simply not enough. I expected a whole lot more from this book and kept waiting for answers."
2,Not as good as The Successful Physican,If you don't have much time then read the following book instead: The Successful Physician: A Productivity Handbook for Practitioners. It offers better solutions that you may not think of. The E-Myth Physician talks about things that don't work but suggest little of what to Do About It.
2,A couple of good ideas and filler,"The author has a couple of good ideas: management is about building processes not about managing people, and the value of a practice is it's process. The problem is that we get no details about how develop such processes. Instead we get a bunch of meaningless psychobabble about change and motivation and the same two presmises simply repeated over and over again. This is nothing like a practical guide on how to rework a medical practice."
5,quickly sent,"book seems good thus far as a young practicioner still in residency looking to understand what were seldom taught. would recommend for anyone who wants to combat obamacare and learn to run your practice as a business, as thats precisely what it is"
2,Too Vague,"We expected more out of this book. No fresh, new insights into improving efficiency or systemizing a medical practice as would be expected. E-Myth Revisited & Mastery are still the best to me. Michael Gerber, please revise ""The E Myth Physician"" & teach us hard-headed physicians how to really deliver care through an impressively systemized business."
1,Disappointing,"I liked the E-myth Revisited. I think every business owner should read it. After you read it, don't assume that his other stuff is good, because it isn't. After reading this book, and skimming some of his other ones, I will never buy any of his other products, and certainly will not be travelling for one of his $5,000.00 seminars about daydreaming."
4,Must read for new doctors,"As an OD ready to start a new practice, this advice was invaluable. Many of us spend years perfecting our patient care, but never learn how to run a business. Easy read with some good advice."
5,Cycle Supplement is FANTASTIC!,"I have a 120 gal freshwater aquarium with about 50 - 60 fish....Corey Cats, Clown Loaches, Mollies & several varieties of Tetras with a few Chinese Algae Eaters to boot. I change 25% to 30% of the water in my tank each week and this equates out to about a bottle (16 oz) of Cycle a month. At over 20 bucks a bottle it's a bit on the pricey side. However, at Amazon I found it for just a little over 10 bucks a bottle and my tank looks beautiful ALL of the time and it isn't eating up my budget!Cycle is in my opinion the single best aquarium supplement on the market....It is the ONLY supplement I have used in the last 4 years.Creative Coral Reef was the seller, and I am VERY impressed with their service.Sincerely,Ralph C. Kinzel"
1,You get what you pay for,"I had a gig to play in a few days and decided to tune a half step down and decided I needed a Gb/F# harmonica for a few songs I play in the key of ""G"". Didn't want to spend much money so I ordered this one. As usual, you get what you pay for. Made in China cheap construction and the sound is terrible. The higher reeds don't work unless you literally blow as hard as you can. Spend the extra money for a good Hohner or Oscar Schmidt"
5,Soulful with the abilty to allow contemplation.,"A superb album, The flow and rythm draw the listener in. Track 4 would be my favourite. I am often reminded of evenings and nights spent sitting on a beach breathing in the setting. These have been for a number of reasons and yet the music has managed to touch many of them. I recommend a darkened room, a fire, a bottle of wine and a wandering mind. As a soundtrack alone, the music complemented the film perfectly. If you have watched the film you will be reminded of the scenes that each piece was created to accompany. I thoroughly recommend it."
4,"Some of the best minimalistic music ever written, not a great production though","Wim Mertens is my favourite minimalist along with Philip Glass. This soundtrack has it all. Great themes - probably the most memorable themes of any other soundtrack and intense atmospheric playing. The production of this CD though is very 'minimal', more so than any CD you'll ever buy for $20. I can not think of any other CD of that price range lacking all the essentials. A pitty.... 5+ * for the music, 1 - * for the package."
3,Handy Gadget,"It is a handy gadget to use with the Toppik powder, especially if you are a little shaky in controlling the flow near your hairline. Though a regular comb may also give you the same results."
1,I should have believed the other reviewers!,The fact that these are paperboard & not plastic isn't the problem. It's that they don't work. The powder goes under them and still ends up on your forehead. I love Toppik and you just have to put it on carefully to avoid the hairline issue. These don't help at all.
2,Self-Aggrandizement in a nutshell.,"My first reaction upon reading the first 100 or so pages of this book was that Korda thinks he is really great and wants to tell us all about it!! Korda mocks his readers with his self-congratulatory tone throughout the entire book. Korda has talent as a writer, but wastes them here in a high class, status conscious, name-dropping book (who cares if he lived for 2 years as a child in Beverly Hills? Isn't the title ""A Memoir of OTHER People""??). A well-written memoir engages the reader by adding creative flavor and story-telling to its non-fiction nature. Korda fails to do that here."
2,Korda needs an editor!,"This book drags and is repetitive. Korda constantly reminds the reader of his ""accomplishments"" such as being the only publisher who rides daily in NYC. Yawn. He's very busy talking about how wonderful he is to the detriment of the book."
5,KORDA IS A GREAT STORY TELLER,"ENJOYED THE CHAPTER ""ISN'T SHE GREAT"" ABOUT JACKIE SUSANN. IRONY OF HER FORBIDDING CRIPPLES AT HER BOOK PARTY, IRVING MANSFIELD'S FATHER WHOSE NAME WAS MANDELBAUM WAS CONFINED TO A WHEELCHAIR DUE TO INJURIES RECEIVED IN WORLD WAR I. SHE PROBABLY DIDN'T WANT HER BROOKLYN IN-LAWS THAT LIVED ON CROWN STREET TO SPOIL HER IMAGE."
3,lessons learned?,"Unlike previous historical authors, Ball argued that the politics of slavery overwhelmingly predisposed the western mission of the regular army--affecting the hearts and minds of officers and enlisted men both as the nation plunged toward civil war.By adapting the Indian style, the American military was able to eliminate their own casualties and conquer tribes one by one. One wonders why more military units didn't use hit and run style during the Civil War, instead of the ""everyone line up and present a nice target to the enemy, like a good gentleman should""."
3,BE READY TO INVEST TIME,"This educational software will be helpful to any child's knowledge, BUT be ready to invest time into ""dowloading"" software patches from the Topics Entertainment website.I guess there were some software difficiencies in the CDs, so you have to invest some time into fixing these deficiencies. Its pretty easy, but don't expect to download the software into your computer and be able to run all the programs."
3,Covers the Basics,"The HP iPAQ Pocket pc rz1710 is a good buy for the first time pocket pc user. The built in applications are very usefull for managing your day to day activities. Furthermore its screen resolution is great for the price. However it does not come with bluetooth or wifi which severely limits its ability to connect to other modern gadgets or the internet. In addition its low internal RAM prevents it from running many third party applications. In summary, If you are looking for basic functionality to help organise your activities, this product is for you.If you need more than that a higher end product is what you should be looking for."
2,Remade Hits,"This is one of the few drawbacks of buying online. If I had been able to pick up this cd and turn it over, I would be able to read that almost all of these songs were not original recordings, but remakes. I figured they were ""Roger Whitaker- Greatest Hits"", not ""Roger Whitaker-Greatest Hits Inexplicably Re-recorded""."
2,Too little - Too late,"Sadly - this cd is a bad deal. labeled as ""greatest hits"" - the cd contains only 11 tracks - it is low in quantity (total playing time: 39:18) and in quality. the cd doesn't include whittaker's phenomenal original recordings made in the early 70'ies - but poor re-recordings: the major hits like ""durham town"" and ""the last farewell"" are re-recordings from 1986 and simply cant be compared with the original recordings. the only reason i gave the album 2 stars and not 1 is for the featured song ""river lady"" - which is an original recording from 1961 and is just a great recording - featuring whittaker's rich and full voice from that time."
3,Not as good as I expected,"I've enjoyed selected songs by Roger, but several on this CD just aren't up to the ones I like. He has a great voice, but some of these selections were not the best for him to sing."
1,"Disappointing, Not Original Recordings","Our family grew up with Roger Whitaker's voice anytime we were in the car. Somehow I lost that recording (which was about a quarter century old!) Therefore, I worked diligently to find out which of his offerings were the real thing - that is original recordings, with the original tempo. It was disheartening to find so many re-recordings done just enough differently to not bring out the wonder that was Roger back in the 60's and 70's. We attended a concert about 6 years ago and found that not only did he not perform those wonderful oldies he was famous for, but his interest was really more about his love and concern for his African countrymen. If he wants to sell, he needs to bring back those original recordings!"
5,The answer to all,"Roger Whittaker's greatest hits covers it all. The music is wonderful, and I can not drive anywhere without this tape. It brings peace, beautiful voices (little boys singing) and the message that needs to be sent to the world daily. Sounds trite, I know, but....if the world just listened to that instead of the stuff on TV..all would be well !!I wish all the young young children in countries where they are being trained to kill all the ""evil"" people on the planet, could listen to the tape and get the message. And, adults too..but too many of them are programmed beyond repair.Anyway. Thank you Roger Whitaker for your music. I am a math teacher, and my husband is a judge and we KNOW truth when we hear it. Thanks. Awesome awesome voice, moving, touching words, but my words can not adequately describe you Greatest HIts. Kathryn Felton"
4,Not his best,"While this is not the best CD of Roger Whittaker, I purchased it for only one song - I Am But A Small Voice. It didn't let me down. This is a special song to me and is difficult to find. He is still great - voice, songs."
2,re-make?,sound like the songs(the bigger hits at least)are re-makes at a much later time!!(not as good). disapointing to say the least..>>The seller was top notch and i got the cd in record time!! << IT WAS THE RECORD COMPANY..NOT THE SELLER THAT I HAVE A BEEF WITH!! THE SELLER IS GREAT AND I WILL ORDER FROM HIM AGAIN!!
1,Disappointing,"I picked up this book as a brand new Judo student looking for tips and techniques, and I was very disappointed. This book goes over only 3 throws, 3 chokes, and 1 pin technique. There are no escapes, no counters, and no reversals. There is some okay general information on Judo history, competition, refereeing, etc, but I need to learn the basics before I worry about how to be a referee."
2,"OK general JUDO book, but it isn't about the GRIPPING",This is a general overview of judo and is OK at that. It is not for someone looking for great depth in the very specific sub-division of judo involving the theory and practice of various gripping techniques.
