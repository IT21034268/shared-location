2,"Great directing, satisfactory acting, bad story/script","We watched it, all felt the same. Great directing, cinematography, excellent visual quality, lots of style, audio quality, editing, enjoyable score. Acting was back-and-forth. Some things carried-off very well, very believable. Other things not done so well. No single actor was always great or always bad. They each did some very good stuff and some not so good. But the script was bad. Not horrible, just weak. Story was muddied, sometimes confusing, meandering. A lot of activities occurred, but the story didn't really progress much. It's as if almost nothing happened at all, just a lot of activity. Some surprises, but no feeling of suspense or expectation. No satisfying build-up, climax, then resolution. You never really cared about any of the characters or what happened in the story. The characters needed to evolve more from the opening to the ending."
1,This is not a good movie.,"Extremely thin (if any) character-development, predictable plot twists, irritating techno score... the filmmakers have the pretension toward a cold, Kubrickian examination of power and violence but not the skill to pull it off."
4,"Memoirs Are Good, Even In Flesh",This book is a pretty good read about one man's struggle to find himself and make sense of the world around him. The use of the tattoos makes the story that much more enjoyable. It is amazing to find out the meaning of each of the authors amazing body art. The use of the tattoos in portraying life is an art that has been lost in today's commercialized tatto world and it is nice to see that tattos still hold a place in story telling.
5,Naked.,"I bought this book because I had read about its premise in a magazine, I forget which. I thought ,""Hey, cool, a memoir centered around the acquisition of tattoos."" Since I acquired my tattoos at very specific times in my life, I was curious about someone else's tattoo reasoning.This book was so much more than I expected. I felt as if the author were lying naked for everyone to see--not only his tattoos, but his soul. His words were honest, sad, funny, and touching. After reading this book, I no longer felt alone in the world; I felt as if someone finally admitted to the same feelings I felt guilty about for so long.This book really is one man's journey to find a self he can live with, a self that emerges triumphant, with 7 beautiful scars to boot."
4,Great read!,I've had a great time reading this book. It's full of lots of great facts that are both useful for trivial knowledge or as conversation starters.
2,"Not Impressed, but Mildly Entertained","The book was entertaining and contained some pretty interesting information. A lot of the stuff in there is a stretch, however.For example:The book offers the interesting trivia that the western-most point of Virginia is actually west of West Virginia. In my opinion, however, the author is way off base in concluding that ""West Virginia is not really west of Virginia"".Another interesting fact: The Mona Lisa, painted by Leonardo DaVinci, was not called the Mona Lisa until a later period. Thus states the author: ""Leonardo DaVinci didn't paint the Mona Lisa.""Another totally inappropriate entry is the author's personal interpretation of the US 2nd Amendment presented as fact.These are probably the worst items in the book, however, and there was some pretty good information besides.If you would like a trove of fascinating information, however, I would instead recommend Bill McLain's 'What Makes Flamingos Pink?'"
2,"all human disputes start with the fact that everyone believe its truth its the only ""truth""","matthhew rignanese's review about this book is simply genial; these book (and almost all of them by the way) are debatible and refutable since all of them are based on pure semantics and data that should not be treated as facts nor laws nor truths but just, i repeat, revatible data"
5,"If you want a valid and easy color vision testing book, you found it!","I have been tested on this product countless times and it is such an ease to use. I can understand why so many pediatric optometrist/ophthalmologist would use it for testing color vision in children or people with developmental handicap. Being colorblind and taking this test so many times I would expect myself to find clues and hints about what shapes are on each card. It just can't be done.People are coming out with new ways of testing colorblindness on the web and, in all honesty, I have taken several of those and due to either the screens contrast or lighting I can often see things, which I should not be seeing. I would recommend this product to optometrist, ophthalmologist, school nurses, and people who are thoroughly interested in color vision and excellent testing products.The colorblind guy"
1,"Inhumane, but does work in only small areas.","This is very inhumane product. I had a mice problem on a 6th floor high rise apt. !! The maintenance man introduced me to this.One little cute mouse did not get the memo and ended up on one of these. I felt sorry for the little creature, but he was stuck on this and ended up dying just hours later from the stress.Since I am single with no pets, I have decided to place moth balls around the stove where they were coming from. For small mice, this works like a charm. Only problem is that moth balls in large numbers can be quite toxic, and I did have a really bad nightmare where this stuff must have gotten into my brain, but I must've grown immune because I've had no problems since."
5,great product,"as a second time buyer of this product (case of 72) I can say it works perfectly for what I need it to do ... and that is catch bugs & insects like scorpions, crickets and brown recluse spiders. Thanks Catchmaster."
5,Knock 'em dead!,"I am sooo glad to finally have some new CatchMasters...bye, bye bugs & mice that cross the path! Thanks!"
4,Works for me,"I have had an unstable SI joint for several years, and go to PT on a regular basis. I recently had my second child, which (as expected) put me out of whack for a while. The SI belt does reduce the pain and keeps things in line until I can get back in shape. A little inconvenient as it goes over your underwear (and you can see it through clothes as it has to be tight), but it does help the back."
1,Too small!! and I could not change a size......,"I just opened it and I realize it is too small, I tried to change the size but they say I can not change the size if I already opened. So it is useless and waste for me. I will not buy anything from them."
2,Do your research first!,I bought this belt to alleviate SI joint pain during my first trimester of pregnancy. The belt alone was ineffective- I believe you have to have the belt stabilizer pad in order for it to fit and work correctly. I'm unsure of why they are not sold together.
2,moves around,"I purchased this belt as a back-up to another belt that I had. I loved this other belt, but I felt that it was giving me a rash when worn in warm conditions. It had a vinyl component that I may be allergic to and since I was heading down to the Bahamas, I felt that I needed another option. BUT..this belt rides up whenever I sit/stand, therefore rendering it useless for sacroiliac stabilization. As a result I feel that I can only give this belt a ** rating."
1,Does not work with curves.,"As someone else said, this belt does not work if you have curves. I suspect that I either cannot get it tight enough or it just slips out of place. The belt does not keep my SI joint stabilized even if I have it as tight as I can get it. I gave up on it after less then a week when it was causing me to have more pain."
2,Skin irritation,"After only a few days of wearing, this item irritated my skin and rubbed it raw causing my skin to scab. Don't recommend."
3,Belt is just OK,I got this belt to keep my hips aligned. I have a back brace but it is too hot. I don't think this belt works as well as the brace. It is also inconvient when you want to use the restroom as you have to take the belt off every time or push it up and out of place. Then trying to get it in the correct position again takes some time.
3,"It helps a little for me, nothing more.","I've tried 3 belts and none have offered the relief others have said from these belts.Maybe my condition is too severe, I'm now in pain 24/7 and I'm at the point of looking for a surgical solution so that can give you an idea."
2,Open the front cover and you will find....,"A world of the most unentertaining short stories, essays and poems you will ever encounter."
5,Makes a Great Gift,Gave this piece to my wife and the gift succeeded with flying colors. Novica ships with special packing and artisan bios. very nice touch.
2,A HUGE disappointment,"First of all, I got this by mistake when Amazon listed this as a special offer for comedy writing. It is in fact a British police procedural, and a poor one at that.The author spends pages building a back story, but nothing ever comes together. The protagonist (and evidently the writer) states that many cases are solved by accident, not through any skill on the part of the police. That is how it is resolved - just by dumb luck, and no reason is ever given for why the killer started the spree in the first place. I had never read anything by Pawson before and I thought the development was OK, but wrapping it up was just a huge slap in the reader's face. (And the title is so incredibly lame, referencing a comment at the very end of the book with no tie whatsoever to anything about the case.)"
1,Very uncomfortable.,"OK, I was looking around for a better shoes because my old ones were from Walmart and were uncomfortable, So I came across these and I read the reviews so I went ahead and ordered them.The first day : After wearing them for 4 hrs I had to take them off during my lunch break because my feet were killing me. So I thought maybe I just need to get used to them.After a week and a half : I wore them everyday for at least 8hrs and everyday my feet hurt so bad I can not stand to have them on any longer than I have to.The shoes do look good and they seem to be made good but when it comes to work shoes comfort should come first.AVOID IF YOUR LOOKING FOR COMFORT."
3,Not a keeper but enjoyable.,"The characters had enormous potential but I feel that they fell short. Plot was good, but again left the reader with lots of questions.....like did the bad guy get caught?? The hero was a hunk but.... Perhaps the best and clearest characters were ""paw"" and jesse. Jess was the ""ho"" who was really a sweet lady and explained how she happened to be in the 'business'. At least u understood what she was all about. This was a big book with lots of ""words"" but that didn't make it any better. Just an average western."
4,excellent noir novel.,"last year i picked up a copy of the book ""1001 books you must read before you die."" this book (""cutter and bone"") was included as one of the 1001. i already had a copy of it. it had been in a cardboard box in one of my closets for about 20 years. so i dug it out and read it, and, unlike many of the other recommendations from ""1001 books...,"" this was actually a very good book. like most noir novels, likeable characters are scarce. this is dark stuff, about unappealing people; but interesting and compulsively readable their lives are. the story is a wild one, and the author pulls it off in an unpretentious and seemingly effortless way. i felt not a false step among the pages. it struck me as believable from 1st page to last. all in all, an outstanding crime novel."
4,"so so quality functionally good, good cork","Sound quality is fine, creates teeth impressions...not very solid plays fine for students not pro quality...1 2 3 4 5"
4,torturous,"a very cool compilation of songs from this amazing band. furious and paranoid noisy rock that in both intense and miraculously tight. contains some live stuff that includes some cool improvisation and some surprise instrumentation (saxaphone). a treat for fans of this band, but get the Face Of Collapse album first."
2,Aerial Stereo: Photographs by Harold Wanless,"Very crude photos, certainly can't be treated as a 3d atlas, but rather as scientific data. Great pricing though."
5,I lost 7 pounds.,"Great cleanse - Easy! I lost 7 pounds right away. I've taken this product 3 times over the last year. It reduces the stomach size and helps get you cleaned out. Every few months I take it again. There are huge benefits to paying attention to this underrated part of our systems. I took Formula 1 at night before bedtime and noticed results the next morning. Then, after a few days I took Formula 2 and noticed greater results. (Sometimes I would feel temporarily bloated. That went away and the overall effect was a big loss). Remember to drink lots of fresh water. I recommended it to my wife and friends who also liked it."
4,No Complaints,"I used this product and lost 15 pounds the first week. During the cleanse I only ate fresh fruits and raw vegetables and juices. There was not a noticeable increase in bowel movements, but I have been cleansing for fifteen years and I have regular bowel movements. So, I don't have all of the excess waste that most people would have. I did notice an increase in bladder activity. I believe when the toxins were released from my tissues it caused the excess fluid to be released which I didn't know I had. I felt very good and energized afterward. I was very pleased with the results and would use the Almighty Cleanse again."
1,Almighty Cleanse,The company I purchased the product from did a great job. Shipment was great and the items was recieved in perfect condition. BUT!!!! the almighty cleanse is junk. I urge people to not buy this product. You will gain weight and feel very sick. This product made me very sick and I started having blood in my stool. I have had to go to several doctors and they are trying to figure out what it product had done to me!! Any company selling this product should stop before it hurts their name.
1,NOT WHAT IT CLAIMS TO BE,I bought Almighty Cleanse (seven day program). I took the 34 pills a day; that many pills a day made me feel very sick. I could not eat yet I gained 10 pounds in seven day. No plug after I finished the product - just the weight gain. VERY disappointed in this product.
5,Perfect,"I have been needing to buy more heavy-duty pins for my daughter's long hair when I put it in buns for ballet. These definitely fit the bill. They have a nice ball tip, and they are heavier than the cheapy pins I've purchased before from the beauty supply store. I also love that they are bronze! Great buy, don't hesitate to get these."
3,Great item,These hair pins are perfect for me. They blend in nicely with my hair color so they're not noticeable when I wear my hair up. Love them.
3,Good reading,"If you want to know the reasons and the background of the fall of Barings bank, I recommend it. You will be surprised what were the levels of control at that time in the most respectful bank in Europe and in the world. Nowadays it's really hard to imagine that one simple back office manager could lead the whole bank giant into trashes. Good reading and relaxing with a flair of adventure."
4,Rogue Trader,"This is a truly captivating book for all who have an interest in financial markets. As an insight into how large financial institutions operate, it is a must read for auditors, students and managers in how not to run a business. The pace is fast with the onsetting panic of Leeson being palpable as he races towards the inevitable crash. The Ewan McGregor movie obviously stuck close to the book, but if you have already seen the film it will not distract from the book which adds more layers of complexity to the story. Well written, amazing insights and some thoughtful life lessons given."
2,Boasting greed,The obvious greed - albeit encouraged by his employer - and the sheer incompetence of this author and felon are astounding - yet his writing tries to generate our sympathy. An unpleasant story and not a book I should have bought as it only encourages and enriches the author.
1,Not even a trader,"I though Nick Leeson was once a good trader who have lost it all, but I fact he was just a back ofice operator who was send to the floor of the SIMEX to take order from clients. He never make money, nor have trading strategies. He just sell put to have income to cover some handling order mistakes. After he lost to much he buy futures contract to try to come back."
1,Keep the manual close,"The ak330 is anything BUT user friendly. Keep the manual close by, our you will never figure out how it works. Many of the functions are only available through the remote. So if it's not working, you're out of luck. The radio tuner picks up stations that are two states away. When we have our local stations on, the distant stations are so loud, that we have to turn the radio off. We don't have that problem with any of our other radios, so there is something wrong with this Panasonic. We would not buy this set again. Panasonic's quality on all their merchandise has worsened during the last few years."
5,Stealth genocide,"This is the first book to lay out the real story of cancer research,genetics, molecular biology, and the laboratory development ofpathogens for military and political use. Professor Lee gives aseamless documentation of this history through citations found themost respected science journals. He clearly shows the involvement ofthe world's top scientists and research institutions in a paradigmwith a single goal -- that of using the power of science to shape theworld's population to liking of those who have the might and thecallousness to do so. Lee's book shows how the biologists, in a fewshort years, walked pathogenic viruses up the evolutionary ladder insuch a way that they could single out ethnic and genetic traits....I onlyhope that Professor Lee follows this book with continued research thatlooks into the cut-and-paste biological history of the rest of the newand emerging pathogenic viruses and mycoplasms."
2,Poorly constructed,I used this twice before it broke. The unit itself is fairly solid but the plastic that holds the black extender clips in place is what keeps breaking. I was shipped one that I had to return because it broke in transit. Now second use and the same piece broke. Yes it has a supposed lifetime warranty but I dont really want to be contacting people for new ones every few weeks during the winter.
2,Disappointed,"I was hoping this would be a better 'broom' / ice scraper combo, but I am disappointed. It is made of good quality material, but the ice scraper isn't all that effective, and the broom sweep is not wide enough or thick enough to tackle a lot of snow. The head is tall so it doesn't store under the seat very well, so I just hung it on a nail near my vehicle and have used it a couple times to brush the snow off the pickup hood. I'm only using it until I find a better vehicle sweeper that won't scratch the hood."
1,Cold and plastic do not mix,"The plastic stoppers that hold it in place when extended snapped off the very first time I used it, now it's junk.I would not tell anyone to buy this product."
3,Broke,This is a pretty neat item. Too bad the length adjustment button broke the first time I used it. Plan on returning it and hope that the next one lasts longer.
2,"Real Heavy Duty, Scratched Paint","I got this snowplow for winter.....After used it for one month, I noticed that my car's paint has been badly scratched by the rubber bristles.....Even a polish or buff cannot fix my paint on my hood..........I should say, it is real heavy duty, but too hard for your baby vehicle....."
2,Save your money...,"Overpriced, superficial coverage of the topic and not very professionally done. I was hoping for more instruction on calling moose and scouting. Maybe covering moose habit more than just looking for available clearcuts. Most of the video centered on the harvesting of Mr. Brooks' two moose and even the harvesting wasn't shown as are most hunting videos, because it seems that the cameraman was more interested in looking around the camera (and waving the camera around) at the time instead of following through the viewfinder. Just not a lot of useful information on hunting moose, though the section on skinning and quartering was very informative. Save your money, you can get more info just casually web-surfing."
5,One of the Best Shows on TV,"Medium is definitely one of the best acted and written shows on television. Recently, NBC, canceled this series, which makes no sense whatsoever considering it still has great ratings, but not to fear, CBS in all it's infinite wisdom picked up the show from NBC, and will be airing it after Ghost Whisperer on Fridays! Now the show will definitely get the props and attention it deserves, because it truly is one of the best shows on television. If you haven't seen an episode of Medium, I suggest it highly, because it is definitely one of the best written and acted shows on television! This past season was absolutely excellent, and the last episode of this season was just absolutely incredible! This is Must See TV!"
3,"no subtitles at all (English, hearing impaired,..)","we were very surprised that some DVD still have no subtitles at all, and disappointed that customers' attention was not drawn to this fact.You really have to check all the fine print even when buying a DVD!! :(:("
3,Formulaic,"I dig this show because it is often dark and even a little scary. It's a show my wife and I can watch together. That being said, we can both usually figure out where the plot is going 5 to 10 minutes in and the way both the husband and district attorney seem to doubt her abilities over and over again every episode is a little silly. How many times does she have to do something paranormal before they just shut up and take her word for it? Flawed but still fun television show."
5,Put the shame where it belongs,"If you will notice, Medium is a CBS show & it was CBS who didn't air it in the first place & so NBC picked it up to give it a shot. With today's economy, it basically boils down to NBC looking at their bottom line & not wanting to give their competition money for a show that their competition produces & that they pay to air. I have watched Medium from day 1 & have all the seasons & will watch it no matter which network it is on(I work with an NBC affilliate)"
5,Medium Fifth season,I love this series and would recommend this series to anyone who is interested in this type of story. The actors in this series are wonderful.
2,The worst season,"This is one of my favorite shows. Seasons 1 & 2 were really good and it went downhill from there. It has been on politically correct side from the beginning, but it was mild enough to overlook until the fifth season. First of all, it is the least realistic from the psychic side with the temporary dead doctor etc. In the previous seasons the stories were quite realistic. Now with anti-gun diatribes and anti-survivalist nonsense I got really mad. And when they got to discussion about impending doom for the whole family and that nothing can be done about it I could not watch it anymore: what, they can't reinforce doors and windows, install cameras etc? Millions of people (literally) have these things, but this show would not even mention them."
5,The best show that was on TV,"I have never missed one show of Medium, I have all DVDS except season 6 and season 7 which I will be adding to my full 7 years of watching this show. I was so disapointed when it was canceled. Anyone that was a Medium fan should get these DVDs they are all great.Richard"
4,Medium: The Complete Fifth Season,I thoroughly enjoy this TV Series and always look forward to the next season. A series worth adding to your DVD collection.
4,two thumbs up!,tool box is durable! sturdy construction with a deep compartment. my fiancee loves it!
1,don't waste your money,cheap cheap cheap quality- batteries died within 1 week- viewing area very small and it's impossible to see anythingsave for your money for better quality one or a digital fertility monitor!
2,Never Again,I have been trying for the last 2 months now to figure this thing out. I haven't been able to get saliva without bubbles or I get too much or too little. It's hard for me to read. I can't tell if the focus is off or if I just really don't have ferning in my saliva at all. I'm sticking with the pee sticks.
4,Cute story,I purchased this as a gift for my 5 year old nephew. It is a cute story; good for the 6 and under crowd.
5,My favorite book!,This is my favorite book of all time. Great story and illustrations! My wife and I found this in Pottery Barn Kids and loved it at once. We don't have children and still read this at least once a week. I share the book with all of my friends and family. Great gift to share!!!
4,Fun story,This is a fun story about 'bad' things turning out to be good things. Maybe things aren't always as they seem afterall?
5,Love Childrens Books,"The theme of acceptance has been delivered in a wonderfully unique story that brings a huge grin to the face of reader and ""readee"" alike. I came across this book while on vacation and couldn't wait to deliver it to the 3year old little person that was having a birthday. The fun illustrations are absolutely delightful and a joy for whoever is turning the pages."
4,"A ""must"" for beginners","This book is based on simple examples and permit to beginners to get used with the basics of CMOS VLSI design. It shows how complicated circuits can be implemented simply and gives an overview of imortant tricks used by professionals. ""Buy this book"" was probably the only clever thing my micro-electronic teacher said !"
2,"for circuits, uyemura's book is much better","this book is just a collection of too many thing without a deeper insight. at least for circuit design, john uyemura's book will give you a much organized presentation."
5,KERI ARTHUR KEEPS ON GETTING BETTER,IF LIKE ME YOU LOVE KERI ARTHUR... THEN YOU'LL LOVE THIS BOOK CIRCLE OF DEATH - 2ND IN HER DAMASK CIRCLE FOLLOWING CIRCLE OF FIRE.. ITS AN ON THE EDGE OF YOUR SEAT READ.. I FOUND MYSELF HOLDING MY BRIEF CONTINUALLY... ITS HARD TO PUT DOWN. I AM NOT SAYING ANYTHING ABOUT THE STORY APART FROM THIS INVOLVE SHAPESHIFTERS AND MAGIC OF THE WITCH KIND... EXCELLENT CAN'T WAIT FOR THE NEXT ONE...
4,keri arthur,"I bought this cause I love her riley jensen seires.This is a bit differnt but just interesting, the story moves along and the interaction between charactors real and believable. Hoping this will be another long lasting series, for one of my favorite writers."
1,wat is this??!!,a marker?no it stinks.dont get it.my brother got it as a toy and it stinks.get the 98 custom.
1,The Sealed Portion of the Brotherhood of Jared,"The sealed portion of the brother of Jared should have remained sealed. If you are looking for a quick read, just cover the parts of this book that make sense. The only thing that can be taken seriously is the realization that good money is required to purchase this book."
3,The True Book,"I am been looking for the only true religion my whole life long and always. I have believed one religion after another and never found the one that answers everything. I am not sure and don't always understand the brotherhood? But, after reading this book, I may give over all my money and worldly possessions and following the brothers into the woods. God is great, halaluia!"
1,friend of 2 kids who are in this cult.,"This book was so stupid I couldn't even finish reading the book.If you want the real truth go back to the big black book the Bible. It is the Word of God. This author is nothing more than a cult -leader and I see what it has done to the lives of people who come into contact with this group of people, and it is teaching them mistruths and leading them astray. May God have mercy on their souls."
1,Save Your Money,"If you are looking for salvation, don't buy this book. Passing it up will SAVE YOU from wasting your money."
1,Looks Fishy,"If you are looking for quality reading material, you may want to continue looking? After puzzling over the content I began looking into the qualifications of the author. His lack of credentials and history as a sensational fake put this writer in a class by himself, but not in a good way."
2,Not much about web services,"This booklet introduces basic security concepts, but talks very little about SOAP/XML-based web services. For some reason, it spends much of the book describing Microsoft-specific security features, but that information is not very relevant to SOAP-based web services.I thought this book covered the wrong material, and it did not do a particularly inspired job of even explaining the topics chosen by the author. All the material related to web services was very vague, with little or no examples. The coverage of Microsoft product information was much more specific, but that was not what the book was supposed to cover.The booklet made brief mention of XML Digital Signatures. It should have focused on all of the new technologies under the WS-Security umbrella, plus technologies like SAML. 20 pages introducing that stuff would have been great."
1,It's just a Joke...,"It is more about IE settings ond other stuff, but nothing about web service sercurity ;-("
5,Funny.... so damn funny,"This is the funniest music i have ever heard. The craziest part is that the band actually has HUGE talent.Finally, the vocalist is in both Trivium and Capharnaum. I'm sure you know Trivium by now and if you don't like metalcore it might be a reason not to buy this album. However, in Capharnaum, Jason Suecof screams like Michael Akerfeldt of Opeth! Yes, this guy has many many many different singing variations. In this album that Crotchduster has produced, he even does high power metal vocals. True talent!"
2,Surprisingly disappointing,"I was really looking forward to this book, and then when I got it, it was all lists and facts and didn't tell me *what* was important -- there was enough information -- too much, even -- but not enough indication of what was essential and what was fluff. I guess I expected a lot more."
5,Graduate Student's Opinion,Sattler's work is a wonderful tool that has helped me better understand assessment. There are wonderful charts and worksheets that make interpretation of results much easier. I recommend the purchase of this book to anyone involved with the assessment of children. I especially recommend this to any school psychology major.
4,An important reference tool and must read for School Psychologists,"This book is a 'must have' for every school psychologist. Sattler is a recognized expert in assessment. The book is certainly helpful as a reference and an overview of important concepts. The reason I gave it 4 stars was that I found the writing a little hard to follow at times and overly general on certain topics. I heard that Sattler now has additional guides that can be purchased with this book. It would be great if Sattler would provide smaller and more specific 'how to' manuals for the main assessment tools school psychologists use. Overall, I can see how Sattler has achieved is excellent reputation. This book is a necessary reference for all practitioners in the field."
2,eh...,This was a dry read. I hoped to get some definitive definitions for Learning Disabilities and assessments but they went about it in such a round about way that it was hard for me to figure out what I was actually learning about at the time. The review of each assessment is helpful but the format was hard for me to follow.
4,very interesting book,"I really enjoyed this book, because it talks of local history here in Wendover Utah & Nevada. The areas it refers to and recounts are still here, with some of the buildings and areas still intact.I had spoken with a local friend who remembered some of the history, and recommended this book, which validated his recollections, as well as other documented local history.It's fun to be able to relate to what's being talked about in the book, and made me feel like I was actually taking part in the story. Well written and very enjoyable."
4,Good for sensory/ADHD kids,"Our daughter's OT suggested getting kids' yoga DVD to help her stretch and to calm her down when she gets overstimulated. This is a cute DVD and she loves doing the exercises. It does help her and I can do it with her, which is great. She'll even do it by herself."
4,Great for Ice Storms,"This scraper is the Big Gun for clearing ICE from car windows. It really only shines on those mornings when there is a layer of actual ice on your windows, not just frost or snow. When others are scraping madly with their little ice scrapers, you literally mow through the ice with the Ice Dozer. Chips fly, ice crumbles, grown men cry, women swoon.In light or moderate winters, you're just as well off with a standard scraper, but for the heavy stuff, you'll want an Ice Dozer.I keep a snow brush with a squeegee blade (best for removing frost) and an Ice dozer in my trunk during the winter months."
5,A MUST HAVE!,"This album has a great hip sound. I bought this CD couple of years ago. I let a friend borrow it and she never returned it. Now I saw it on line and I had to buy it. Still love it.... It has the sound of any secular R&B group, but with the message of Christ."
1,Falls very short of mark.,"Good idea to have sheet music and midi files and separation on the cd. left if organ and right is piano with drums on in stereo. The playing is very machanical sounding (quanitzed) and lack soul. As a church musician myself, I was looking for something new but I would not recommend this to anyone starting out. The intermediate and mastering blues piano books with cd you'll find more useful. Also going to all music guide online (for those with ears) plug in a search and buy the albums and simply study what the greats are doing! Also visit a few churches and see what they young and elders are doing. DO NOT BUY THIS!!! BUYER BEWARE!!! IT'S A WASTE OF MONEY!!!"
3,I've hiked almost all fo these,"I've hiked almost all of these hikes using this book. About half are accurate, the other half, forget it. You cannot find the trailhead. I was pissed off alot of the time because I drove miles out of my way and couldn't find the trail. Also, this book is old and the topography has changed quite a bit. SOme of his strenous hikes are not, but usually it is the other way around. He needs to drive these roads again, some of the ""well graded"" dirt roads are horrible, rough and rocky. Don't even think of going to White Mountain Tanks near Phoenix, it is a zoo. The Picacho Peak site was great, though."
3,You can find the same info on the internet,"This book was okay, but you can pretty much find all of this info (and more) on the internet. Most of these ruins didn't really seem that ""seldom seen"" to me. However, if you don't want to do the research on the web, I would recommend this book as a good resource."
3,Well....Not the best,"There are ONLY 5 songs, the other 4 are little stories, which you will not understand unless you know japanese.....I suggest you buy used ones cause is cheaper, besides, this album is worth it, but NOT EVERY penny. It should be like $10dls. NO MORE. Buy a Used One !!"
2,Pocket Tones is not for everybody,"I purchased two of the Farleys Pocket Tones. After a month or so, one of the devices is broken: it runs through the battery set quickly, without my using it.The other one still works, but I find it isn't a perfect solution. First, there's no real on-off switch. You use the Pocket Tones by pressing one of the pitch keys and then pressing that same one again. So, it's always ready to play, even when in a bag or in my pocket. And it does. Often.I've come across it singing to itself in my pocket or bag. This can kill the array of batteries at times. There's no way to know what the battery status is and I've had it die at times when I needed it.At the minimum, it needs an on-off switch. I'm looking at non-electric solutions."
4,A must-have for singers,"I've really been getting a lot of use out of this to rehearse my choral parts when there is no keyboard handy to start me off on the right pitch and help me find some of the high notes. The on/off switch keeps it from ""pocket singing."" The volume control has a wide range. The keys are easy to read. I would have given it 5 stars but for the fact that to turn off a note you have to press the same note again. That means you have to remember what you pressed, even if you pressed it by accident. It would be much better to have an ""off"" button on the front of the device. Still, its a great value, and I'm happy to have purchased it."
2,Short life span,"I bought this and thought it was great. Then about six months into using it, it stopped working. I thought, okay battery is dead. Bought another battery (watch type) and put it in nothing. It just stopped working. It was small and convenient and I didn't need to blow in it, but unreliable. Won't buy another one."
1,Is it a myth?,"I have come to the conclusion that this product is a myth. Twice I've tried ordering it and each time I receive a different Farley product that is no where near what the advertised product is in features or performance. If sellers don't have the product, they need to pull the listing. Otherwise, it's a waste of everyone's time and resources."
2,Rather Flimsy,"I've owned 2 or 3 of these and have not had much luck with any of them. I find I they lock up and require that I press the reset button on the back, which requires a pen or other pointed instrument. Older people in my chorus have trouble hearing it for some reason. The buttons seem to require more pressure over time in order to get the thing to produce a tone. I have to press it several times now. Battery life is also rather short. On the plus side, the tones are dead on accurate according to my Korg tuner. Even so, I can not recommend this device."
1,propaganda book,"If you want to teach kids to be Vegans, read them this book. The cows running after Bennie are crying, ""Don't you know what hamburgers are made of?"" Then at the end, Benny swears off ever eating hamburgers and only eats vegetables. No moderation in this book."
2,"well, it's interesting....","Admittedly, as I write this review, I'm not sure what to say about it. It's a brave experiment on Barbra Streisand's part, especially since very few people would try to make music out of the sucking noise of a vacuum cleaner. But I also have to say that alot of those brave moments, such as the one I just mentioned, falls flat.Despite the creative approach to this, I have to say that this album fails more than it succeeds. Yes, the versions of ""People,"" ""Second Hand Rose"" and ""Don't Rain on my Parade"" are inventive takes on the songs, and others, such as ""I Got Rhythm"" are just heavenly, but this is just too weird to work as an album on its own.The t.v. special, which I saw for the first time only recently, is fantastic, and something all fans will love. This, however, is for the completest only, and even then will not get much joy out of listening to this."
5,A 'must have' for Babs fans,"Earlier this year I discovered the DVD of this TV special. I was in college when this was broadcast and I guess I just missed it since this was pre-VCR and pre-DVR. Barbra displays her incredible, versatile talent"
4,"Great Voice, Kooky selections","Sometimes it's hard being a Barbra Streisand fan. An Album like this is the perfect example of why. Her voice is in absolute divine fashion on all of these songs. Her range is phenomenal and she holds some notes for a thrillingly long amount of time. The problem? she muddles up some beautiful singing with rediculous concepts. Why did ""I Got Rythem"" have to be intermingled with snatches of other songs, with bizaare musical accompainement. Why did ""The World is a Concerto"" have to include appliances, which are totally distracting. There are some gems here, ""I never has seen snow"" is absolutely divine and nearly worth the price of the CD. If your a Streisand fan, like me, the brilliance of the voice outweighs the ""kookyness"" of the album. If you arent, well this wont convert you."
1,Almost unlistenable,"I have them all and love them all, but this one is almost unlistenable. An experiment that failed. Buy it for the cover art, only."
1,Horrors! This is on CD?,"I still remember the nightmarish TV special. Well, maybe this could sub for ""Halloween Noises"" at a costume party."
1,Three Million Tires Burning Out Of Control!,Barbra or Kenny G's soprano sax? We have a pile of 3 million tires burning out of control about 60 miles east of here and they don't pollute the air nearly as much as those two.
2,From High Hopes to High Disappointment,"With a large backlog of books yet unread, but always on the lookout for something different and new, I came across the excellent reviews of THE SOFT DETECTIVE and felt that it looked very interesting, with a good premise. Not finding any of Keating's books in local bookstores to try to judge whether he would be to my taste, I ordered the book anyway. This was one of those times that the chance did not win out. What may have been a good short story was a slow paced and boring novel that, if it weren't so easy to read, I would have put down long before its 270+ pages had come to their own merciful end."
4,Your son is your prime suspect,"DCI Benholme is a quiet, empathetic person who always looks at the other's point of view. This should be a valuable trait in a detective but it conflicts with the hard-nosed world of policing. It also cost him his wife, who left him for a jock. And maybe he hasn't been such a good father either, although he loves his wife and son. He doesn't get much respect from any quarter. But he is an honest, careful, dedicated investigator, and his first suspect in this murder is none other than his own son. These are the two elements that set this novel apart - the ""softness"" of the character and his son as suspect, which of course torments him. It is an easy to read, entertaining, and unpredictable book that is skillfully crafted."
1,Won't ever get that 90 minutes back,Moves incredibly slow. I didn't care about any of the characters. I just wasted 90 minutes of my life. Excruciating
3,A Bit Shallow,"We never really get to know these 3 characters. Rip Torn doesn't have the subtlety to play this rich record producer. His girlfriend and son, conversely, are often too subtle. Maybe the script didn't give them enough revealing dialogue for any of them really make you feel one way or the other. There wasn't anyone to like or dislike. You just coldly find they all deserve their misery."
2,Disappointing,"Although this book is recommended by many as a standard work in the field, I personally found it unreliable and uneven.Fahlberg focuses on attachment to the exclusion of all other special needs and developmental tasks, and recommends techniques (such as ""holding therapy"") which many experts on attachment have criticized as harmful and even abusive. I found her account of separation issues to be much less sensitive and thoughtful than that of Claudia Jewett (""Helping Children Cope with Separation and Loss""), for example.There is almost no reference to organic mental or physical disabilities, except for outdated references to ""schizophrenic children"" dating from the 1960s.There is useful advice in it, but it doesn't extend far beyond common sense and is undermined by inaccuracies and omissions."
5,Awesome volleyball shorts!,I love these volleyball shorts! They feel so nice and comfortable and aren't too short or too long. I plan on ordering another pair! Shipping was fast.
5,Tight Fitting,I loved the way the shorts hug my curves.Nice fabric. very nice. I highly recommend anyone to buy thses
2,Augh,"As a competitive volleyball player, these didnt work to well for me. They had a high, tight waste and poorly stitched. Uncomfortable at crotch area. Would ride up a little to high, and showed butt. Thin, and can see underwear under. Not to great in my opinion"
2,Quality Control ?,"Comfortable and fits well, but how does something leave the factory with incomplete stitching and loose threads ?"
3,Adequate for the price.,"I bought this blade as a backup. When I installed it there was a noticeable increase in vibration. I cleaned the blade, adjusted the guide bearings and played with the tension with very little improvement. The quality of cut is ok. It is worth the money and might be a good choice if you're a little strapped for cash. I really would prefer to give it another half star but that isn't an option. In classroom parlance it deserves a C instead of a D but that's the way scale goes. It's worth what it cost."
4,A must have album if you like that folk blues scene!,"This is a digitally remastered version of David Bromberg's 1974 release. It was one of my favorite albums back then and it has only aged a bit. The music is fun and energetic. No lovers lament here. Great blues and humor that makes each song a favorite. These days when most albums have one or two pretty good songs, it is nice to listen to an album where every one (except mayb Wallflower) is a nugget."
4,David Bromberg has his own style,"I think this was Bromberg's first solo album, after he played with Jerry Jeff Walker and some others. He has a well deserved reputation as a great guitarist. Some of the songs here might be considered novelty songs. Bromberg is not like anyone else, and I suggest you listen to some previews here on Amazon, or either look up some vids online before buying. If you sort of like him at first, he will most likely grow on you, and you will come to love him later."
4,Charms and perils of Paris,"""Who doesn't love Paris? Reading an anthology of writers who lived in, and wrote about Paris is only second best to being there. From Hemingway to Sedaris, Thomas Jefferson to Langston Hughes, these well-chosen essays span over two hundred years. Whether describing the start of the French Revolution, or a corner bistro in present times, this book helps enrich one's view of Paris, and better appreciate her charms.""Paris In Mind"
4,Solid and Modern,"If you would like a modern review of statistical mechanics with detailed information of important statistical mechanical models (Ising and things like that) then this book is solid and concise. It is by no means an introductory book, and sometimes it is a bit too terse even for the advanced reader. However, a graduate student who has already had a good introductory course in stat mech should benefit from it."
5,Good Stuff !!!,Good with lotion so your hands will not be too dry. Works well !!!I saw Seattle Woodland Park Zoo was using it everywhere.
4,good foaming water free cleaner,I put this on my son's changing table for quick access. I think I may be a little sensitive to the product but it's handy and has a pleasant scent.
1,"Good Product, Bad Shipping","The product is good, now that I can use it. When it arrived, the container was leaking and the pump was broken. I had to go and buy another product, use it up, and the fill the container with this product. So, definitely do not buy this from Amazon - because the packaging is terrible and made the product useless (since it is foaming instant sanitizer)."
5,What can you say???,"This is Big Black. If you like them and you don't own this, get it. There isn't enough Big Black songs available as far as I'm concerned, so own them all!! If you have never heard Big Black before, I would suggest listening to some mp3 clips to see how you like them. Not everyone has the good taste to enjoy Big Black."
1,Will never replace my old Vise Grips,These pliers will never work as well as my classic old metal vise grips. They don't work very smoothly and constantly click and clack when clamping down.
1,A Shoddy Piece of Junk!,"I returned this item THREE TIMES, and never got one that worked without a snag. They would consistently jam up, and not work as they should. IDL's quality control leaves a lot to be desired, and these so called self-adjusting pliers are clear evidence of this! My suggestion to Amazon is to no longer carry them. Don't waste your time and effort with these. You are better off with the time-proven non automatic vise-grip pliers."
5,nice wrench,"This works fine grips tight and hold tight. Although I mainly used it for a wrench and dont set the lock that often. It cheap and does the job, what else can you ask for."
1,Worthless,Absolutely does not work as advertised. I fiddled with it for 30 minutes and could not get it to perform like I had expected. Hardly worked at all as regular plier. Could not get locking feature to work consistently or well.
1,Quit possibly the worst tool ever invented,"It does nothing very well. If I were to sell it, I'd advertise it like French weapons, ""Never fired. Only dropped once."""
5,Excellent once you get the hang of it,"I have a couple of these in different sizes and absolutely love them. They aren't meant for the more rugged applications of a vice grip, but have worked for me in most situations around the home. It took a couple of times to get used to how they work, but since then I have loved them. My trick is to hold the ViperGrip with my thumb and index finger on the handle near the jaws. I only apply pressure with my thumb and index finger until the jaws are at the correct size. Then, I apply pressure to the rest of the handle with the rest of my hand to get the tool to lock on. I think it's a wonderful tool to have around."
5,"If you like punk, this is for you.","I saw a concert in LA w/Fear, Circle Jerks, and Black Flag. Wow this really brought it all back. If you like punk or want to get in touch with the punk movement of the 80s in the US this is for you."
4,A literary treat,"Matt Stevenson has been a travel friend and tour guide through his book""Letters in Transit"" and now again in his new book""Mentioned inDispatches. This is more than a travel book. Stevenson has such an in depth knowledge of history that I feel like I'm drinking from a fire hose as he leads me through ""Vienna at Twilight"" and ""War's End in Okinawa.""He has immersed himself in literature and shares excerpts andquotes with us in each of his essays. Combine this with his own literary style and you have a treat for readers.His eulogy of Michael Huberman, not only includes quotes from King Lear but his unique phrasing: ""Everyone here had those delightful conversations with Michael-a white burgundy of friendship.""Yes, heroes are those who are ""mentioned in dispatches."" Stevenson is a literary hero."
5,Fabulous........,"A MUST READ for anyone interested about magisteria of science and religion. Well written essays (as one would expect with Kurtz as the editor) presenting both sides of this discussion. Never more relevant than today when religionists are making the claim about ""biblical science"", ""creation science"" (an oxymoron) ad infinitum. America can be a strange land where mythology and fact are allowed to mingle in some minds. This book will make you THINK."
2,One-sided,"I am not a Christian but I still was offended by the one-sidedness of this collection of essays, most of which first appeared in Skeptical Inquirer. The volume is titled ""Science and Religion: Are They Compatible?"" but a more honest title would be something like ""Scientists' Views of Religion: How to Leave it Behind"". Out of the 39 essays, I counted barely a handful that defended religious views. There is a place for such a collection, but editors should have been more honest about their bias. That said, the essays did provide insight into the 'science overcomes religion' perspective. Especially helpful was Gould's essay presenting his famous 'non-overlapping magisteria' argument (that religion and science are not incompatable because they preside over entirely separate domains of values vs facts), and a rejoinder by Dawkins."
4,Science vs. Religion,"Although some in the scientific community see a role for religion in science many other decry religion as unmeaningful in the natural world. In other words if you cannot see, feel or taste it, it probably has no validity."
1,**************************ABSURD!,"-Blind Faith is a harbinger of idiocy and precursor of mind control!-********SCIENCE AND RELIGION ---Are They Compatible?-********************ABSURD!Since when has 'Fairy-tales' and Scientific determined 'fact'been thought of as ""Compatible""?-Careful research should prove to any rational person that""Religion"" is organized crime'!-Consider""Suicide bombers"" and the victims of pedophiles!-And that: ""Infidels""? ""It is better to kill them all""!(From the first of ""The Five Pillars of Islam""!)-"
1,My goodness,Yeah this is not a biased approach at all!! My eyes are rolling up in my head from the massive quantity of sarcasm....This is not a good approach at all.....Money is a valuable thing... don't waste it on this book.
2,Kind of cheap looking,"I guess you get what you pay for, this is one of the least expensive steering wheels Grant offers. The wood looks nice, but the rivets are not flush with the wood. They are indented and makes me wonder if I'll get splinters in my hand. The spokes are just silver painted and make it look cheap. Overall this just looks a little cheap in my car as I have no silver paint in my interior, I guess it would be okay if your cars has silver in the interior. However, for me it just looks a little too cheap so I'm returning mine. As far as build quality, it is okay, seems sturdy."
4,"wonderful characters, excellent plot","A foundation stone to understanding the Guild of Renunciates (Free Amazons). The characters have great depth, and the plot is compelling. They should reprint this book!"
5,venice: art & architecture,a very wonderful book for people who love art and architecture especially for a wonderful and enchanting city such as venice. Through this book one is able to be transported in time and view its art and architecture one that cannot do in even the most dedicated of travelers to this fascinating city.
1,not satisfied,"I purchased it last month. It didn't work. I asked Amazon how to return it but asked me first to change the battery, it's weird because it's new right? I managed to replace the battery only yesterday because I was busy. It cost $41! I thought it will work now but when I wake up this morning, it stopped again! That's why I will return it and I hope I will receive the full refund because it's frustrating!"
4,Good indepth info for the adventurer,"If you have a short time in the Philippines and want easy, but good, trips laid out in detail Lonely Planet is better. But if you really want to learn about the Philippines, get a handle on the remote areas, leave the tourist track and plunge into wilderness or hang out with remote tribes, Moon is much better. I use them both."
2,Would not like to depend on this book for information,"Unlike the great South Pacific handbooks by Moon this book lacks detail. It mentions areas you can go to, but not how to to get there or where to stay. It has general information but is not worth it. Would rather like to depend on Lonely Planet, am going to check out Jens Peters book as well. I'll pass on this guide."
4,"Used, and enjoyed!","This was our guide to our last trip to the Philippines, and was priceless. Was enjoyed just as much by our relatives there. Would never have enjoyed the 'Hobbit House' so much if it hadn't been mentioned. This is a must have guide for anyone travelling there."
1,Something to offend everyone,"The members of a very large cast each must face a spectacular moral dilemma or personal outrage. How many of these incidents can be fitted into an hour? I only watched Disk 1, I gave up. Like other reviews, there are lots of far better wartime stories, try Foyle's War if you need a suggestion. The Cazalets is a melodrama, maybe a little more disjointed and sordid due to hastily moving storyline arranged so every character can have a eye-popping crisis in each episode. Bad script, poor story development, to be avoided not because it's too adult but because it's too childish and superficial."
5,The main disappointment is that no more episodes were made,"I recently watched this mini-series for the first time on DVD. It was wonderful to see Hugh Bonneville featured in this WWII-era British family saga, after enjoying his performance in the first two seasons of ""Downton Abbey."" The production was superb, from the period costumes and settings, to the fine acting by an excellent cast.My major disappointment is that the series went out of production before reaching the end of the tale as set out in the Cazalet Chronicles novels on which it's based. Having not read the books, I've now reserved them at the library, because I've become so interested in the story that I want to follow the characters through the war years and to the end of the saga.Actually, I have another, milder, disappointment. Unlike the DVDs watched by a previous reviewer here, my DVD set didn't contain ""explicit"" ""sex scenes."" Not even close to ""porn."""
3,An unfinished symphony,"The acting is great, the period drama done so well, as only the British can do. It is a great story, and you are really getting into the whole thing, and wham bam in the middle of the war the series is over. Clearly there was meant to be more, there was a great deal more written in the books, but you are left hanging, with no conclusion and no ending. What happened to this mini-series, do they run out of money? Very, very disappointing."
1,The Cazalets,"I was very disappointed in this series and turned it off before the first episode had even finished. It seemed to me every other scene was one of the various couples in bed. I am a huge fan of period pieces, but I felt this one was trying too hard to be some sexy soap opera rather than an intelligent drama. I will be sending it back."
4,Renewed,I've used this product at a spa many years ago and was thrilled to see it again. It is very relaxing and leaves my skin very soft and free of toxins. It's a great product to create a spa like atmosphere in your own bathroom at home!
2,Its a photocopy...,"I recently bought this book from Amazon (Mar 2011). Nowhere among the information available at Amazon did it indicate that the book is now only printed on demand in a photocopiable format (advice from the publisher), ie it is a bound photocopy of the original. I was quite surprised and disappointed.The other reviews on the Amazon website are some years old and positive feedback re the quality of the printing and colour must relate to the original publication.The content seems to be as I would have expected, but I objected strongly to Amazon re paying $90 for a photocopy. They were quick to offer a $30 refund. I kept the book to avoid hassle sending it back and I needed the info, but in hindsight I would look at other options rather than paying even $60 for a photocopy."
5,good condition and the price was right.,Got here in reasonable amount of time in good (practically new) condition and the price was right (about half of what I would have paid for it at my college bookstore).
2,Not worth the money..,"This collar looks great, but doesn't work well. We couldn't get it to stay tight so we would randomly find it laying on the floor or outside. I give this collar two stars because it looks good, but it's not worth the money!"
4,Great record,"The Butthole Surfers are one of the best bands the 80's had to offer. This was their first LP that started it all. Definitely recommend it. For fans of Kill Dozer, Primus, The Jesus Lizard, Shellac, Laughing Hyenas, Ministry, Pavement, Etc."
4,"LOW BUDGET ART ROCK,MILK","MES JUST LOVE THE BUTTHOLE SURFERS,MES THINK THEY ARE A TRULY ARTISTIC BAND WHO GETS OVERLOOKED IN ROCK MUSIC,BEACAUSE THEY A GREAT BAND ...MES LIKE THIS ALBUM,IT'S ARTISTIC AND SILLY,I CALL THIS AVANT-REDNECK,IT IS HARD TO DESCRIBE THIS ALBUM THE BEST WAY [I] CAN DESCRIBE IT IS,SILLY PUNK MEETS SONIC EXPERIMENTION A GRAET COMBINATION.GIBBY HAYNES IS A WONDERFUL SINGER ALTHOUGH MOST PEOPLE MIGHT THINK HIS VOICE IS ANNOYING.THE LYRICS ARE VULGUR AND IMMATURE BUT GOOD FOR A LAUGH,MES LAUGH AT THEM,...IF YOU WANT TO KNOW HOW GIBBY GETS THAT VOCAL SOUND ON THE SONGS""EYE OF THE CHICKEN"" ""COWBOY BOB"" HE USES An ELECTRONIC BULLHORN A GREAT SOUND HE GETS WHEN HE USES THAT.ALL IN ALL I SAY THIS IS THEIR THIRD BEST ALBUM,2ND BEING REBRANDT PUSSYHORSE,AND THEIR BEST ALBUM EVER,""LOCUST ABORTION TECHNICHIAN"",GREAT STUFF...,YAY ... FOREVER,BUTTHOLE SURFERS ARE AN ARTISTIC FAVORITE ..."
2,I dont know...,"Ugh. Picked this one up because I am a HUGE fan of Electriclarryland. This one's noisy and non-melodic. The rhythms are simpler than the ones featured on electriclarry and more punk-ish. 'Negro Observer' is pretty cool, but pick this one up only if you dig 'bad music'."
4,Why this version is better than the domestic version,"I found this particular CD in the bargain bin of a record store for like $3.99, and since I was already a Butthole Surfers fan I didn't care if it sucked or not. What I noticed is that the last four songs on this imported version were the same as the last four songs on my cassette of ""Rembrandt Pussyhorse"", although the names were slightly different on some of the songs. These four songs were from an EP called ""Creamed Corn From The Socket Of Davis"", and the songs seem to fit well at the end of both of the albums they were attached to: ""Two Part"" is one of the best songs they have ever recorded, not to mention the classic ""Moving To Florida"" is found here as well. Overall, the original ""Psychic..."" album is not one of my favorite Butthole Surfers albums, but even their worst album rates three stars (""Weird Revolution"" in my opinion)."
4,the world's intro to Butthole mania,"The Surfers' debut album is nothing short of scary, wild, downright weird, and yet fascinating to listen to. If you've listened to nothing but the Butts' newer stuff, especially Weird Revolution, you're in for a big surprise.Firstly, the cover art is great in itself, which is what appears to be grainy head shots from an old film reel, painted over with graffiti. The album title: yes, it makes no sense, but I love seeing the looks on people's faces when I mention it.Song highlights: the bizaare opening song ""Concubine""; ""Lady Sniff"" which sounds like it's being sung by an old man with Alzhemiers, complete with dirty bodily function sound effects; and the whacked-out ""Cherub"". Good luck understanding Gibby's lyrics, as the majority of the songs are sung, using distorted vocoders and tape loops.A downright enjoyable album to weird out to and scare many friends. What would have been really [good]is if Latino Bugger Veil re-released it on CD..."
4,A BLAST of good vibes!,"It's not often you hear a song as irresistible as ""Mighty Mighty""! On their 5th album, EWF was getting it together tighter and smoother than ever. Each album seemed better than the one before it. Standouts here also include ""Kalimba Story"", ""Devotion"", ""Drum Song"" and ""Open Out Eyes""-- but I also can't help but laugh when I hear 2 guys discussing their ""problems"" with women on ""Tee Nine Chee Bit"". Power, class, style AND humor! And dig that cool logo. These guys had it all."
5,""" A Masterpiece""","Please, do not listen to the viewer from Texas. It's must buy for your music collection."
1,my God,"oh my, don't buy it. I'm a white middle aged man trying to recapture my youth but this was NOT the way to it"
4,Beauty In simplicity,"This saw is a beautifully crafted tool. Very sharp blades should last for quite a while, The handle is lacking a little though, feels and looks cheap, like it was an afterthought definetly not the same level of quality as the blade. and the shipping time was unusually long(needs Improvement) Over all i'm happy with purchase the quality was in the parts that count, but has potential to be improved upon."
2,DISAPPOINTED!,"I bought this toy to bring when we go to grandparent's houses or other places. The book itself is very cool, but when I received the item, toys were missing and ripped. If I could send it back, I would. I'm so disappointed that I paid for something like this."
4,Excellent Incentive for Tummy Time,"I bought this item because I wanted an interactive mat for tummy time - not just a mat with toys at an end. What a great value for all the activities inside! My child is 11 weeks old, and he is fascinated by it. So far he has only been able to play with it with my help, of course, but he is anxious to get at it alone!I was having a hard time motivating my baby at tummy time. Hopefully this will do it. The activities seem like they will be of interest to him for a long time. We have friends with a 1 yr old, and I think she would have a blast with this toy."
4,Great but out of stock,These gloves are great I originally intended them for use in the fireplace but found them very good for working under a car with scaldingly hot pipes and metal. They protect my hands and wrists. They are great quality and have had them for months of non-stop use that would destroy most gloves but these don't even have a scratch. I have gotten many comments on how great these gloves are and would like to gift a few pair for Christmas but they have run out of stock.
3,Liner problem,"I used the gloves three times and the liner on the left hand glove tore,Will return.Color is bright orange, not brown as advertised."
5,A must have for wood burning devices!,"Looked at other reviews for this product before buying and found the good reviews to be very accurate. Glove are more orange, than red, but not a big deal to me. They work so very well. We recently installed a wood burning fireplace insert and it gets extremely hot when stoking it up and adding logs. I could not get close enough to get a log in other than to toss it in and hope for the best. These gloves allowed me to load the log and place it in a certain spot without getting burned. They go up to the elbow which is perfect for trying to feed wood in! They are high quality, well made and a great help to me."
5,best yoga book yet,"Of all the various applications of yoga I've tried (classes, home practice, books, DVD), this is one of my all-time favorite yoga practices. True, there's no video to follow along with, but the descriptions and diagrams in the book are great, and the author's calm voice on CD guides a person through all of the exercises. The additional chapters in the book are also well worth-reading and the illustrations are fun, too.The best thing about this work-out is it only takes 15 minutes. About the only prop you'll need is a chair for some of the sitting exercises and there is nothing here that is too difficult for even a beginner. The workout is even better than a morning cup of coffee -- instead of a caffeine fix, get ready to start each day with a yoga fix."
4,Cup of Yoga,"I liked this easy to understand and do book. Sometimes in the morning I have a few moments of quiet time and when I use this book, my day seems to go a little bit better. I also am not as stiff in the morning if I have ""yogaed"" the day before. I recommend this book because of the ease of use and the little amount of time it requires.Wendy Belaski"
2,Not a good place to start,"This may be a good sequence to complete, but if it's your first ever exposure to yoga, you will have a hard time finding the right postures. Get this if you already know a bit of yoga, but otherwise, I recomend getting a DVD to follow instead. This is in no way a stand-alone solution."
5,Best little book I've purchased,"I've been working on a four year project, and this little book has kept me sane. I've even talked my team members into doing routine with me. It's great with our without the really nice tape. I've even done it in the airport, and had people come up to my and say what a great idea it was to do yoga before a long flight! I also like a Morning Cup of Meditation and a Morning Cup of Massage. Not so much a Morning Cup of Pilates or Balance."
5,a morning cup of Yoga,"Simple,fun,an easy read. You will love mornings again. The DVD is a bonus....but the book really is fun. The routine can be done any time of day."
1,Very disappointed!!!!,"I ordered this book on yoga to assist in teaching me the basics as my Neurologist recommended my doing yoga to assist with debilitating migraine headaches. I ordered this book specifically because the routine is basic and short, and mostly because of the CD that came with the book which would walk me through the routine. When the book arrived, the CD was missing from the sleeve in the back of the book--- VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!!! I will never order again from here or any other associated site! I paid for something that I did not receive!!!"
2,not what I'd hoped it would be,"this is a cute book, however it is very much for beginners. So if your just starting to learn yoga give it a look. I was hoping it would be a variety of 15 minute yoga routines. It was only one and too simple for me. If you have been doing yoga for a while you might want to try a different outlet."
5,Hi-Tec Cape Trail WP Hiking Boot,"GREAT boot for the $$$.Lightweigth,nicely padded with good support,quick break in time & very well constructed.Truely waterproof! Good fit / true to size.I use these boots for hiking & backpacking."
5,Awesome movie,"this movie is awesome. rutger hauer was perfect for the hobo role. this movie has great special effects, a great story and great actors. i was really impressed on how well this movie was made for a independant film. some of the best movies are independant low budget films. this movie was great. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do"
5,Starts out sketchy but pcks up fast,"A great independant film, damn good acting on part of Rutger. Their are moments that are really cheesey but they are few and far between. This film really pushes hte envelope on what filmakers can show, this has a lot of gore. Perticularly when the Hobo hides inside the body of a cop(like on Southpark when Cartman hid inside the body of Mrs. Chokesondick). You also finaly get to see kids getting killed. I have always hated that maniacs always use restraint in movies that procliam to be hardcore, this film shows a busload of kids getting roasted, and it's awsome. This is a film that's a fun B flick that dose not wimp out."
2,Hobo with a shotgun,Just cause somethings different dosent make it good. They took a horrible approch with this movie honelsty it was new but nothing really exiting about it. Blame lies dirrectly on the director and writer cause the acting was great. Im glad I watched it but I wouldent really recomend it to anyone or watch it again.
3,Misguided vengeance,"In a limping economy with a massive loss of jobs due toconniving men in fancy suits with expensive degrees,clandestinely scheming to enlarge the gap between therich and poor, results in the true power base of Americaresigning themselves to places like F**ktown.It's a place where one becomes further destitute, whollyapathetic, meandering in a zombie-like trance, while at themercy of a brutal wannabe dictator and his bloodthirstyunderlings whom readily indulge in their barbaric fantasies.""Hobo"" is a surreal, nightmarish journey; a hyperbolictest of the inhumanities of humanity and suffering pushedto its limits. However, it is relieving to know that thegrass is always greener... all one needs is a lawnmower... ora shotgun for change.Guest starring Tom Cruise in ice skates."
2,"Doesn't quite fit the ""Grindhouse"" tag","""Hobo With a Shotgun"" is basically being marketed as a spin-off of the Tarantino/Rodriguez ""Grindhouse"" semi-franchise (which currently consists on ""Planet Terror,"" ""Death Proof,"" and ""Machete""). That's not exactly true. Instead of a tribute to 1970s exploitation, it's a tribute to 1980s Troma flicks. There's a difference: exploitation movies are a lovely combination of shocks and sleazy taboos; Troma movies are just intentionally bad, in the vein of vintage John Waters. Hobo's director clearly grew up on Toxic Avenger movies, not blaxploitation and zombie films. What makes this better than the typical Troma release is the presence of Rutger Hauer, an actual actor (as opposed to the talentless wannabes who populate Troma movies). On the Troma level, it's a gem; on the Grindhouse level, it's more of a miss than a hit (better than the painfully boring ""Death Proof,"" not nearly as good as ""Machete"")."
1,Rotten To The Core,"In a word...pure unadulterated trash. It's not a movie fit for human consumption. Whoever is responsible for this movie coming into being should be evaluated by professionals.Why Rutger Hauer would lower himself to such filth is sad to see. I hope he recovers.This movie has absolutely no redeeming qualities--none. There is no scene, or frame or dialogue in this putrid story that's worth mentioning.Please, do not entertain any thoughts of even contemplating the watching of this so-called movie."
2,Don't Waste Your Time!,"This movie was absolutely repulsive, and the acting was terrible...even for being a B grade film. I know it was meant to look like a 70s flick or something, but it was terrible even for that. This movie could have been so much cooler than it was, even for a B grade movie. The gore was way overdone, and it was sadistic & morbid. At one point, the baddies in this movie even torch a school bus full of kids. WTF!? That's pretty messed up. Watch this if you really want to, but if you want my honest advice...steer clear! What was Rutger thinking? He's much better than this."
4,"A Hobo, A Hooker and Hoodlums","I had been wanting to watch this since it came out and I finally got the chance, and I wasn't disappointed.The Hobo is just looking for a nice place to live and maybe start his own business. He hops of the train in the most crime ridden city around. He soon finds himself in trouble and befriends a prostitute that he wants to help have a better life. They soon find themselves trapped in a war with street thugs, dirty cops and every other lowlife possible. The Hobo decides it time to clean up the streets ""One Shell at a time"".This does have a grindhouse feel but it reminds me more of a Troma movie. The crime filled city, over the top violence, crazy thugs and colorful scenery look like a page out of the Toxic Avenger and that's ok. It works great for this movie. If you are a fan of trashy cinema, then you owe it to yourself to check this one out."
4,Exploitation at it's finest.,"Hobo With A Shotgun is a faux-80's exploitation movie directed by Jason Eisiner and starring Rutger Hauer. It was originally a Canadian-made trailer for the Grindhouse double feature.The premise of the film is a simple one. The Hobo (as he is referred to many times in the movie, his real name never revealed) only wishes to buy a lawnmower and start his own business. However, everything goes awry from the moment he steps off the train. The opening segment is very nicely done, with it's 80's-like intro (akin to Charles Bronson's Death Wish) to the opening kill (decapitation by manhole cover). Do not go into this movie hoping for a cinematic masterpiece like Casablanca, go into this movie hoping for ultra-violence and witty one-liners from Rutger Hauer.Oh and I should mention on a side-note that the ending is very predictable about half-way through the film, but, overall this is a great flick and I can't wait to see what Mr. Eisiner has up sleeve for his next movie."
1,1 star for the Technicolor,"Horrible plot, it's all so cheap. With the exception of the star in the movie, I've seen porn with better actors. I gave it one star for the Technicolor which impressed me. A great movie for people who enjoy wasting money."
1,Hobo with a shotgun,Bad movie not worth watching if it were free. Who ever made this mess is sickin the head. These people need to have their mouths washed out. Foul languageis really bad. Worst i have ever seen in my life. I DO NOT RECOMMEND IT!!!!!!
1,Garbage,"This film is poorly written, directed, and especially acted (excepting Rutger Hauer). It is garish, sadistic trash. Some may think it's so bad it has to be good, but they'd be wrong."
1,"just bad, even for what it is","Non-existent budget, bad acting in a bad way even for this type of movie - I have seen the grindhouse-type movies before and liked them - this was just plain not worth the $, don't even bother renting it."
2,So Bad,It's so bad I had to watch to end to see if it stayed that way. My wife kept looking at me and wondering why I was still watching it.So it will prob become a classic.
3,Rutgar's last bad film,"Liked Rutgar as an actor, good face, nice timing, but in this one,its not over the top enough, because of the bad directing, just goesto show you, it takes some good directing to make a bad film badenough to be good."
2,Carnage and gore in search of a plot,"I was pretty disappointed with what I thought was going to be a fun episode of Robert Rodriguez or Quinton Tarantino style retro-flick. I think that was the idea as this movie was hinted at in one of the ""Grindhouse"" trailers. While it's nice to see Rutger Hauer again especially with the in-your-face title in hand, the film never gets past the raw carnage and bloody gore of the premise. Hauer is a railcar hopping hobo who stumbles upon a nasty town that for some reason nobody leaves. The population stays in spite of the fact that the police and politicians are controlled by the evil Drake and his 2 equally evil sons. They stay in spite of the fact that it's acceptable to board a school bus and kill all the kiddies with a flame thrower...and of course, for no reason. I found the movie pretty stupid without much to recommend."
3,Suprisingly its not too bad for this type of movie,"I dont really like violent films unless its creatures againts manking kinda stuff.And these days there's a lot of gore and violence out there in movieland.Someone lent me this movie and i decided to watch it. I did enjoy it becausewe kinda care for that hobo as he ends up in a town from hell that is been heldhostage by a kingping and his sons in a type of cartoon violence, a bit like the old batman series. Anyway its over the top, i did reckonized abunch of Canadian actors...(ricky from trailer park boys) and i would recommendit for what it is."
3,Bloody,Rutger must have needed money to do this one but it is full of action and the bad guys get it in the end and everywhere else.
5,What can I say?,This movie is a hilarious/disgusting/over-the-top/heart warming tale about a do-good er hobo and his prostitute friend fighting 3 guys dressed in white jumpsuits wearing RayBans... Enjoy
4,An Epic and Violent Grindhouse Film!!!,"I've been wanting to see this movie for a long time, and I finally watched it with some friends, and all I have to say is...wow! This movie was so incredibly and insanely violent. People lose their heads, get ripped open with a baseball bat covered in razor blades, and get shot to death by an ass-kicking hobo. This movie based on the trailer from Grindhouse has more action than Machete. If you are easily offended by children being burned alive or being watched by a pedophile Santa Claus, you should stay away. This was a fun movie to watch, and all the gore scenes are hilarious and epic.Rutger Hauer stars as a Hobo who comes to a new town, overrun with corruption. He befriends a hooker named Abby. While a Pawn shop is getting robbed, the Hobo can't take it anymore and decides to shoot the robbers down with a shotgun. He becomes a vigilante and goes around shooting anybody involved with crime. Never ever cross a HOBO WITH A SHOTGUN!!!"
3,no digital copy,got this but no digital copy very unhappy with this i dont know if ill buy a blue ray again
2,"5 stars for Rutger Hauer, 2 for the shotgun, minus 5 for herr director","This film put me in a bind. I wanted to stop watching this worthless animalistic sick-minded crap, but I didn't want to miss Rutger Hauer's insightful, thoughtful & poignant, Dirty Harry-esque performance. He is as good in this as Mickey Rourke was in 'The Wrestler' or 'Sin City'. Molly Dunsworth was also quite good as Abby, the prostitute he protects, and who dreams of a better life. Jason Eisener however, is a self-important, fat, untalented Canadian who didn't deserve a picture deal for his amateurish movie trailer. But I'm happy that Hauer was able to get some recognition for his ability to be creative within this putrefied dreck. I'd like to have read Ebert's review, but he boycotts gore (Hostel for example) so that's an impossibility. In the future I hope Eisener can only attract actors to his projects that I don't like. Ben Affect would be great! Thanks."
5,this was great,"This was a great grindhouse type vigilante flick. Filled with weird comments that did not add to the plot, it was hilarious and filled with cheesy gore. Although the plot was completely different, the cheese factor was similar to the evil dead. If you like b movies and low budget horror flicks this will be a classic. I will try not to spoil it, but the film is about a homeless man who eventually cracks, and becomes a vigilante in a chaotic town; filled with innocent people and a bunch of crazies, led by a evil family. Highly recommend it is worth watching if you like offbeat lowbudget movies."
4,Delivers What It Promises!!,"This film was incredible! I watched it with a buddy, both of us knowing full well what a grindhouse film is. Having said that, it had all the key ingredients: gratuitous gore, laughable acting, and scenes of violence strictly shot for the shock value. Of course this wasn't supposed to be a well acted, high-brow ""Escape From New York"" type of underdog story; the title explains everything you need to know about it!Lots of people have compared this to the Rodriguez/Tarantino Grindhouse films (in face, Hobo was one of the 'spoof' trailers in the Canadian release), but those were big budget nods to the exploitation films of the 60s, 70s, and 80s. Hobo is more true to that genre than Death Proof or Planet Terror.Many people have also been down on the acting, the violence or the killing of children. If any of that shocked you, than this film did exactly what it was intended to do. You're welcome!"
5,VERY gory and bloody! U will never be bored,"wow, this was very bloody. there was ALWAYS something happening to make the story more exciting. its not scaRy, but its good"
5,Rutger sends himself up!,"Rutger Hauer. the name says it all. Hobo with a Shogun. the title says it all. I have to watch this again: it's really gory, but uninteded humor takes it down a notch. If he wasn't in it, it would only rate 1, maybe 2 stars. But he adds character to this character and makes the movie. It's not a parody of this type of film although it does seem like it at times. Loved it!"
2,"Brutal, and mean","Just look at the title, a hobo with a shotgun, brings justice to a small town. Sure we can have some fun with this. I have nothing against violence, especially if it is un-leashed against a bunch of murderous thugs. Fight violence with violence, that is fine, can we please make it entertaining! This movie is too serious, it takes the fun out of shooting bad guys in various parts with a shotgun. The ending is terrible, although not un-expected. By then, I realized that I already had more than enough about half an hour earlier."
1,Blu-Ray Review,There are a lot of sick people out there. This movie blowsssssssssssssssssssssssss. Total garbage. What a waste of time and money! Homage? You have got to be kidding me. Gimme back my money.
2,"OK, but too gruesome.",This movie does not belong in the action and adventure category. It was grotesque just to be grotesque; the plot had more holes than the bullet-ridden bodies found throughout the film.
1,et tu rutger?,"during the reformation, the great schism ignited by martin luther between roman catholicism and the new protestantism of the north, luther compared rome to sodom, and scaled sodom as the runner up...the war that ensued included every atrocity that could be imagined, such as the impaling of individuals on sharpened tree limbs, roasting them over a slow fire, and slashing open the bellies of pregnant women and flinging their unborn children to ravenous dogs...in other words, it was a fairly ordinary war...but i have little taste for such spectacles, and i find it difficult to believe that an actor of rutger's stature would immerse himself to the ears in a slasher movie that attempts, however futilely, to outrevulse all contenders...at least the trailer gives fair warning, but the high rating it is accorded by critics who have damned to near death films of real quality, with tedious cavils and faint praises, is entirely outrageous."
1,roady xt home doesn't work,Never was able to get it to work either in my home or in the camper. assume it's defective but at the price not worth the trouble to fool with shipping it back.
5,Volume?,I must say this is a good product. Placing the reciever near a window had no effect on the signal which stays at a constantly good level.My only complaint is the lack of volume control both on the device and on the remote. There is a volume control under the settings menu which only has 6 levels. At a basic level give me the ability to adjust the volume with up and down arrow buttons. Go a step further and implement a proper volume control.All in all this is a good product.
3,It's OK for the price,"Upon arrival the remote battery was dead. Purchased another battery. Remote only works if you are within 2 feet of the unit, so it's useless in the house. Works for the car, but is really not necessary since I mounted the unit within arm's reach. All in all it's worth the money, but the remote should be able to control the unit from a greater distance if it they sell it as part of the ""home"" kit."
4,Worked perfectly,We received the item timely and quickly (Christmas Gift).Worked great when first installed and haveing some teething problems ... but PROBABLY operator error and not merchadise error. We recommend seller for fast and quick shipping and response.
4,Everything was great except for the remote....,"The price was right, but the remote worked with the XT but was for a different model. I think it was substituted or an older version. Still happy with the overall purchase though."
3,Good but May be Unnecessary,"Why buy the home docking station when you can listed to XM online for free with your subscription? Online XM includes both World and African stations NOT available on the sats. To me, these are the two best stations! XM over the air has a ""World"" category but no true World stations other than two pop French stations and a Reggae station. Before you buy a subscription, listen to the music online. Many niche stations have been cannibalized to make room for rock and talk stations. XM sounds more and more like FM with every passing week. Sad."
2,Okay but expensive...,"My 2 star rating has nothing to do with the quality of the item, just with the price. You get the home docking station, an AC adapter, the home antenna, a cable and a remote. It just seemed a little weird to have to spend about the same as the radio itself to get items that you really need to enjoy your Roady XT at home. I think Delphi should sell a unit that has *everything* you need to enjoy Satellite Radio in your car and your home for a really fair price."
5,XM at home,"I love this kit. It's half the price of some of the other kits I had found and it works great. I opened up the package, plugged in the audio wires to the back of the radio, plugged the AC adapter into the wall, plugged them into the cradle. Then I set the antenna on top of the stereo and plugged in the roady. It works great. I have better reception in the house than I get in my vehicle. And I can listen to all my favorite shows when I'm home."
5,Roady XT homekit pretty cool.,"It was extremely easy to hook up and it sounds great! The cost on amazon (around $25) was half of what I found elsewhere. For this price, it's a great buy. I don't know if I would have bought it for the $50 I saw at some sites, because that is pretty close to the original system's price.Overall I am very happy with the Roady XT's homekit."
1,Soul Sister,"Barbra tries to show the world that she has ""soul"" on this release and fails miserably. How anyone can listen to this and keep a straight face is beyond me. If you want to hear a much better Streisand cd pick up either ""Superman"" or ""Guilty""."
4,"Varied Music, Very Musical","The album is primarily solo piano, ranging in style from original compositions in the 12-tone mode of Schoenberg to a tune by Jelly Roll Morton. The pieces are all quite beautiful and the piano playing is fine. There are also a few tunes with a jazz quartet. This is an album that will be a pleasure to listen to many times over."
5,Frommer's does Thailand the Right Way,"I am a strong believer in Arthur Frommer and his guides of top tourist destinations. The guide to Thailand 2000 is just another example of Frommers' dedication to American tourists. From inexpensive hotels in Bangkok to prehistoric tribes, Frommer's has created a masterpiece. Oh, and if you have the time, don't forget to visit the beaches in the south!"
5,Style and shine,"I had wanted these earrings for a very long time to match the necklace,Sterling Silver Sculpted Open Square Pendant, 18"", that I had bought previously. Thankfully I have some wonderful friends that sent them to me for my birthday. The earrings are just as nice and solid as the pendant and worn together the set looks great. I do like that the shape is a bit unusual, people notice it and that's nice too.*I posted a picture of how they look."
4,Caution: Get the plastic backings!,"I wish I had read J. Littlefield's comment about the plastic backings a month or more ago! I ordered these earrings and on the very first day I wore them, I lost one of them. I was angry with myself because earlier in the day, a colleague mentioned to me that the earrings looked as though they were starting to work their way out of my lobes, but I was quite busy and just pushed them back on. However, by the end of the day, one of the earrings was gone. I tried backtracking my steps, but didn't find it. What a waste! The earrings themselves, however, are quite nice and I'm considering re-ordering the pair. But I won't wear them until I get some of those plastic backings to hold them in place."
1,"This CD has terrible sound, do not buy it","CD has the worst mastering job ever, i always look at the levels with cool edit and more than half the songs are recorded with extremely low volume and i cannot even listen to this album on headphones or in the car because the sound is so bad it murders my ears at any volume."
1,Payis complaint,I was expecting all that was shown in the picture. All i recieved were the payis and not the hat and beard.
5,Definitive Wildlife Collection,"I am an avid National Geographic fan I own tons of the VHS and get most of the good wildlife videos when the come out on DVD. This collection is made up of some of the great programs that were on VHS but now found in this DVD collection make for a wildlife fans dream. There are 12 programs in this set some of the best are Realm Of The Coyte,Secrets Of The Everglades,African Animal Oasis,Crodiles Here Be Dragons,Creatures Of The Namib and more. National Geographic gets it right and having all these in one set is well worth it I highly recommend this to other wildlife fans."
2,Collecter's Item,While this isa quality collecter's item it has little attraction for the 3 year old it was purchased for. A five year old chose this item for her sister because she had seen the character in her coloring books. It was opened and quickly discarded.
1,"Not stable, a lot of bugs, it freezes when recording voice over 20 mins","I definitely don't recommend this product. When I record voice, it seems that there is a limit of 20 mins. If you inadvertedly record more than 20 mins the player freezes, so you have to reset it using the recessed button. The file system also has problems, I have several zero length files in the player that can not be deleted. I also hungs if you press the wrong key when recording from radio.It seems that the firmware was never tested :-("
3,"Decent for its price, but quite buggy....","I had bought this in Nov for something to listen to on the bus and at work, about a week in I noticed that the screen had gotten really dusty and that there was nicks on the body, not much of a problem, then I found that to copy alot of music at once I would have to load everything....and then meet a error screen and everything gets all buggy. Still not to bad but annoying as hell."
2,Good player but problems,"I had gotten this mp3 player at the beginning of the summer. I had enough of carry my cds and cd player around. I searched the net and found this player. It was a good price but dont be fooled. You can do a lot better. As they say, ""You get what you pay for,"" and thats exactly what I got. But it did come with some sweet comfortable headphones and earbuds. The player had some great features but it was slow. The more music you put on it, the slower it runs. After a few months, the buttons began to stick and become slow. Not very reliable. Like many other people who bought the product, I eventually got a sad face and a bug on the screen. I tried recording something and then when the player went to save it, it froze and showed the sad face. I would not recommend this player to anyone out there. Sorry but keep looking. There are so many other players out there and this one just is not the one."
1,Garbage,"3 months and 1 week into a 90 day warranty and I just get a frown face w/ a bug. No refund, no replacement, have a nice day. I actually feel sorry for their customer service, having to field calls all day about their crappy product and not having anything to tell the customer other than ""I guess it's broken. It'll cost $150 to replace.""Nice. That's what I get for trying to save a buck. This player is no bargain. I'm out $100. I hope this company goes bankrupt. So will you if you buy this junk."
1,Believe the Negative Hype,"If you are reading this review there is only one reason $$$. The price on this player is really hard to pass up. I love a good deal and thought that this would be one with feature set, capacity, bonus headphones, and the price. Unfortunately, I decided to ignore the low Amazon ratings for once.Unlike many other here, I can't complain about this player as mine was dead on arrival. Tech support was a total joke. I charged the player for five hours as instructed but unit would not power on and display had nothing. Tech support recommended allowing it to charge for a while longer as it was new???? I was considering exchanging or sending in to get fixed but lost all confidence and decided to return for refund. Overall construction and feel seemed shoddy as well although the headphones were pretty decent."
2,more notes on the rave mp,"I agree with what everyone has had to say about this device. It's cheap, and you get what you pay for. My biggest complaint was the complete un-randomness of the shuffle feature. It played the same five songs all the time, in the same order, while ignoring hundreds of others.and of course, I eventually got the sad face/ bug icon, and the player was dead.but a few weeks later I tried plugging it into the USB in my computer, and it came back to life, and has been working fine ever since. Anyone else have this experience?"
1,Peace of Junk. Don't buy it.,I would give it zero stars if Amazon system offered it. This item is really a piece of junk and doesn't worth the money. It works when it wants. Freezes several times and not easy to use. It needs to reindex the music files after any change the user makes which takes several seconds and may last to minutes if you have a lot of files. Do not be fooled by the low price as you are paying it for a product that will annoy you everyday.
1,"Resist the urge, don't buy it.","I bought this for $80, not expecting much - just something that would play music. There were lots and lots of bugs in the firmware - I won't even go into them here. Anyway, I just wanted something that would play music, but after only a month of having this thing all I get is a frowny face (the player is dead), and I was quite gentle on my player (I didn't do anything that might shock the hard drive). Although Rave seems like a legitimate company from the looks of their web site, they sent a shoddy and underdeveloped product to the market and you should not spend your hard-earned cash on it. Save up and wait, or invest a bit more into a better product - that's my advice."
1,Throw your money in the street instead,"I bought one on clearance for $35. It was great for exactly 92 days, then it died completely. The company that made it is defunct, so there is no warranty or support, (I wasn't expecting that anyway). It worked pretty well for the short time I had it although the sound quality was poor-to-middlin'. I would not recommend anyone buy this at any price."
5,Great product!!!,I also got the Frown and bug... Eric Hamen but after a week I tried it again and I downloaded songs and it was absoloutely great!!
2,Service Sucks for Rebate,The player itself is OK be careful to lock it after use or else any little touch would turn it on and run down the battery. the life of the battery is not what they said no way it was 10 hours. Also i bought one for a friend and one for myself (hey 2.5F for that price)? what can i say i was a sucker. When i sent in the Rebat forms a letter came back to me saying i can't get one of my rebates... I called them and they said their computer will not allow them to send two to the same address. i asked for the UPC they said it's their property now!!1 liers.Be forewarned!!! DON'T BUY GO VIDEO MP3 PLAYERA co-worker bought the San Disk and it works like a charm... spend a little more for a LOT better quality and Service.
3,Darn good product,"I've heard tons of people rave about their Ipod's. If only they had waited. This mp3 packs more memory and comes with all the necessary tools (carrying case, charger, 100 free downloads, two sets of headphones). Although I was discouraged originally by some reviews I realized that some of their gripes aren't a big deal, so its based on the individual purchaser. The battery power could be a little strong but, its never conked out on me so I can't complain about that either. I'll come back in a month if things go from bad to worst to update you ... I hope I won't have too."
2,Not Real Amish Recipes!,"We were talking to the old man about how good homemade noodles are...DB: There isn't anything better than homemade noodles.Mrs: I used to steal them when they were drying.KLC: How hard can it be? They're just flour and salt and egg and butter, maybe. Hell, I'll make them.Mrs: It's not as easy as it sounds.KLC: Nonsense. I'll just get out the Lancaster County Amish Cookbook.Mrs: That book is a tourist trash. It's not real.KLC: What? I bought it from a real Amish girl, what are you talking about?Mrs: The book is terrible.KLC: She had the accent and the bonnet. I gotta get you one of those bonnets.Mrs: Shut up.KLC: Okay, I'll just look up the recipe for making noodles...huh, there's no entry. Okay, here's Turkey Noodle Encore, that will have a noodle recipe.Mrs: Right.KLC: Here's what it says: Cook noodles as directed on package. WTF?Mrs: You never listen to me. That book is a fake they sell to tourists.KLC: Well, I still like the bonnet.Mrs: Shut up."
2,Just not the right book for me,"The synopsis of this case makes it sound extremely interesting and unique. Two rich young sons both suffering from major mental illnesses? Especially in one tight nit, religious and wealthy family. It seems most people that interacted with them over the years knew something was askew but there was nothing anyone else could really do. The author tends to really go out of his way to embarrass the mother and victim in this tragedy. Does an overbearing nutrition loving mother drive her boys to insanity in all cases or just this one. This book really had a ""blame the victim"" mentality going on. Very sad story but I did not feel it was written to shun Reaganomics or make too many statements about social services. It was just a slow and repetitive book."
3,"OK, but strays a bit","I found the original topic of this book to be interesting, if a bit gruesome. However, one thing McDougal does in this book is to give too much irrelevant information. We don't really need to know what the grandfather of the primary subject of the book looked like, nor do we need to know about interactions between William French Smith and Ronald Reagan, since they have little to do with the book. In my opinion, much of this was filler material to make what should have been about 150 pages into 320. To be fair to the author, publishers often insist on excessive copy these days, as they find it easier to sell ""thick"" books than ""thin"" ones. Using that paradigm, though, most of John Steinbeck and Ernest Hemingway would never have been published. Also, McDougal seems to feel it neccessary to periodically interject his negative opinions of Reagan's policies into the book, and while I guess he has the right, as the book is not a newspaper, it at times becomes distracting."
3,"Mental illness, murder, and Ronald Reagan's policies","The family of Ronald Reagan's personal attorney, Roy Miller, reaps the negative benefits of Reagan's policies toward the mentally ill during his term as governor of California. When Gov. Reagan began dumping the mentally ill on the streets and closing mental hospitals statewide there was little sympathy shown for the families of those most affected by his decisions. It is ironic that his personal attorney, a brilliant and compasionate man, would find his family destroyed as a result of his client's political policy. Dennis McDougal removes the rock covering the slimy underground of California's physchiatric empire and lets the sun shine in. The author maintains sympathetic control over his writing and provides the historical background necessary for the reader to understand and appreciate this long hidden tragedy. A must read."
3,Very Depressing....,"I have two sons, and I pray that they don't become schizophrenic or bi-polar every day. This book was scary. It is about what can happen when parents don't beleive in conventional medicine to help mental illness. Schizophrenia cannot be curied through homeopathic remedies, aromatherapy, macrobiotics, or quack treatments. It can only be monitored through medication and a good psychiatrist. Even then it can still be dangerous, as many schizophrenics don't like to take their meds. The Mom dominated the sons and the Dad seemed like he wasn't there. What a tragedy."
4,2nd best band outta Wisconsin,"After Killdozer, of course. DK's drummer played on the farewell Killdozer tour and was great (check out KD's Last Waltz).Anyways, Die Kreuzen is a band that's been completely forgotten about and that's too bad because they were great! The original LP was a gatefold sleeve so you could deseed your weeed on it. There was a sticker on the shrinkwrap that screamed ""FREE POSTER INSIDE"" but mine didn't come with one! If you're looking at this page on Amazon and don't know anything about these guys, pick this up. Their sound is kinda similar to Laughing Hyenas, maybe a little less dark. Just get it, OK. They're thanked on a COC record as Die Cruisin'!Check out Mighty High...In Drug City."
4,stunning,"Delivery was faster then expected. Looks exactly like the picture, actually even better. The gem was really big. A really nice addition to the jewllery box"
5,Hard to find this smaller roll,Did not need a roll for a dozen knives. This one was a gift for someone who did not need to carry every type of knife. It is sturdy and secure. Was a greatly appreciated gift.
5,All Saints Best,"""All Hits"" by All Saints contains a great mix of their best musical work. This cd contains some upbeat pop music with themes relating to love, overcoming challenges, and happiness. I enjoyed listening to ""Feel You"" and ""I Know Where It's At"". ""Feel You"" is about being in love with someone that brings out the best in you through various ways. ""I Know Where It's At"" is a catchy musical track about having fun and knowing about making the best of life. My favorite overall favorite musical beat is ""Pure Shores"". ""Pure Shores"" is a unique melody about being close to a love interest. ""All Hits"" by All Saints is great to get for the many who enjoy pop music from the 1990s and the early millennium (2000s)."
5,A good step into art,"This cat definately knows the ins and outs of the art world. If for no other reason, this book is worth the money."
3,EGO GETS IN THE WAY,"Thomas Hoving is an intelligent man who had a fascinating career. The problem is that the person most fascinated by Hoving is Hoving. Once you get by his monumental ego, there is much here to warn not only the collector but the museum goer, the student of history and the lover of art. Just how much is real? It is frightening to think that what we revere may not be what we think it is. Oh, well, you can always close your book, turn on the television and watch, ""Antiques Roadshow."""
3,LIGHT READING,"Light reading for those interested in art forgeries. Like others, I found the tone condescending and this is perhaps the biggest negative.Sometimes I write to authors to point out or inquire about perceived factual errors in their books. Some reply and some don't. The church (Muenster) in Ulm, Germany, is not Roman Catholic, but Lutheran. This is one author who did not reply to my letter about that.If you are interested in forgeries in general, try Charles Hamilton's Great Forgers and Famous Fakes, about autographs."
4,Will you ever believe anything is real again?,"This book is thoroughly entertaining, and makes the reader completely suspicious as to if anything they have ever seen in a museum is actually authentic. Thomas Hoving draws on his countless hours of investigation to illuminate the reader as to the frequency of fakes. Although he has occasion to assume the reader knows more about art & history than can be normally expected, he does make you want to read more on the subject. My next purchase will be "" Fake?"". A good read that lacks enough illustrations as to the subjects being discussd, it is equally valuable for its bibliography and end notes if nothing else."
2,"Subject fascinating, information good, editing terrible","Okay, art fakes make for interesting reading. Hoving has had a lot of amusing experiences, and, if he tells with relish the stories of his superior acumen, he doesn't neglect those in which he has been the dupe.But did no one edit this book? Hoving has terrible trouble with pronouns. There are paragraphs that simply aren't worth the effort it takes to figure out which ""him"" refers to which person.It's not that the writing is erudite or obscure; it's merely un-edited. Even on the simplest level, a bronze ""casket"" becomes a bronze ""basket"" for a couple of paragraphs, then reverts to a casket again.Let's have some editing here, guys!"
3,art fakery revealed,"Art fakes and how to detect them - a fascinating subject. Hoving has all the credentials and experience, yet his book is disappointing. A gee-whiz journalistic style, plenty of chutzpah and bragging, some snide comments about colleagues and competitors, gossip here and there among the name-dropping. He wants you to think that even after the many forgeries which have been detected, there are many many more on the walls of museums and in the glass cases of art dealers. And the experts are the real sleuths, not such things as X-ray (and other) analytic techniques.It has a lot of information but is ultimately a superficial book. Not once does Hoving discuss the thorny and fascinating questions, such as - when paintings A and B are quite indistinguishable, what happens when it is conclusively shown that B is a fake- to you, to the painting's significance, to its ""value"" (financial or otherwise) - and why."
3,Used but useful,"I am glad to receive this book. Although it is already been used, and with many highlighted sentences in the text, it is useful to me in my theological studies.One other thing that amazes me is that I was told that it would take a month or two to receive the book, but I actually received it within three weeks."
3,functional but cheapo looking,"The pen holder is a bit small. Otherwise, it's functional. Can use lower tray for clips and drawer for whatever. We use shallow top tray for return receipts on certified mailings we sent out so that we can wait for the confirmation to come back. As a post-it holder as it in the picture of the product on Amazon, it probably wouldn't function well. Takes up small amount of space on desk, and I like that. My main issue is that it looks chap. Like black plastic type stuff. It would be better if it were glossy black. Product in person is almost dark gray and doesn't look as dark as picture."
1,Fundamentalist propaganda,"Not much to say about this work. It centers around a vague, emotional christian propaganda line more in the spirit of a Billy Graham revival than an adequate look at the Manson Family. Those wanting to read something intelligent will likely be let down."
4,Useful Resource,"Webster's II: New Riverside Dictionary / 0-425-10267-XI picked this up cheaply at a used book store. It's a good dictionary, although the ""pocket dictionary"" moniker is a bit of a stretch - this wouldn't fit in any pockets that I own, except maybe cargo pants pockets. Still, it's much smaller than a standard sized dictionary, and it's light enough to easily fit in a backpack without taking up much room.I like how thorough and accurate this dictionary seems to be - I haven't yet found any ""missing"" words that I needed, and the definitions are clear and concise. Some of the included words are actually surprisingly obscure (which probably contributed to the slightly-larger-than-pocket size) but I prefer to have ""too many"" words than too few.If you still need a paper travel dictionary in this day and age, then I definitely recommend this one, especially since it can be bought so cheaply.~ Ana Mardoll"
4,Great album.,"I'll give this one 4 stars simply because although it is great, I don't find it quite as good as some of their past (and future) work. This album took a while to grow on me...it's pretty harsh. But when it did, I couldn't get enough of it. If you don't like it, give it time. It's much more alternative sounding in some parts, yet other parts are very heavy. As always, Dale's lyrics are deep and thought provoking. A favorite line of mine taken from Isaiah 64:7 is ""If my sin remains I have chosen my God."" I urge you to pull out the lyrics and read along while the music plays."
2,Running Board Review,"You sent us the wrong running boards, we purched full length and you shipped for the cab only. We didn't notice the problem until the mechanic had already installed it."
3,Pre-dict-able!,"This is the first Nora Roberts book I have ever read. A friend at work loaned me her copy of the ""Irish Born"" Triology. I have to say, I just don't get it. From the start, to me, it was pretty obvious what was coming between Maggie & Rogan, as well as her Sister Brianna & Gray. While wildly romantic, I like more meat in my reading but then again I am not overly fond of romance novels in general. Nothing really happens in this book. Everyone is beautiful, becomes rich beyond their wildest dreams, with no real obstacles to overcome. Most of the characters are totally one dimensional stereo-types. BORING! I am still reading this book so cannot comment on the third Triology (Born in Shame) and honestly, while somewhat entertaining, I probably could take it or leave it but being an avid reader, I will finish reading this book. Will I read another Nora Roberts? Maybe, just not one of her monster triology series.Overall Rating: Ho-Hum..."
1,Wonderful Irish Nora..wonderful stories...2nd REPRINT,"These are three great stories, HOWEVER...if you have lots of Nora's already, double-check to make sure that you don't have these already since this is the SECOND time these have been issued as a trilogy. Makes you really wonder about the quality of this publisher's current crop of writers, doesn't it. The grade does not reflect the author or the stories, just the publisher's tacky audaciousness at reissuing these again."
4,"Good, a bit uneven","Slightly uneven collection, a lot of the stuff is great but some is strictly for Montand fanatics. Good buy."
4,good value,I bought a spindle sander at a pawn shop and needed all the different sized spindles. This was my cheapest option.
4,Frieza's true power revealed.,"This is a terrifically piece of anime as you find out how powerful Frieza really is. All of the characters fighting have grown enourmously since the Namek saga, you get a real feel for how tremendous the difference is in their fighting power where one can dominate when the other can't even land a hit, constantly switching the leadership. Now Piccolo's strength is surpassed by Vegeta, who is given the power he thinks is of a super saiyan by the reluctant Krillin and Dende, who hurt and heal him, releasing a Saiyan's true power. But even then he's not even able to touch Frieza, who undergoes his final transformation. This video is critical to any collection of the Frieza saga, it creates the feel for just how everyone stands powerwise for the final battle - Goku vs Frieza!"
1,A disappointing read,"Where to begin?I picked this book up in a local bargain bin thinking it might contain some contemporary, witty satire on Ayn Rand... woe is me. This book is full of cliche's, badly written metaphors, and generally uncreative material.If you're a fan of Rand, avoid this book. If you're a critic of Rand, avoid this book. But if you're looking for cheap fuel for your furnace in the midst of these high gas prices, this is a great buy--only 59 cents for a used copy on Amazon!"
4,I Miss Listening To This,"I haven't listened to this CD in close to 2 years - unfortunately for me the band's music is now permanently tied to a negative vibe. C'est la vie.That being said, I was reminded tonight of the track, ""Attraction Is Ephemeral"" and felt like I wanted to add my endorsement to the woefully under-represented numbers (two) of reviews here.Quite simply, this record is a magnificent achievement. It resonates sonically and lyrically to a depth and with a persistence that is beyond rare.I miss listening to this and, once you hear it, you'll understand exactly why.So why 4 stars and not 5? Because I'd like to believe that this strange and long-standing partnership can even exceed this work in the future. And perhaps, after a moment's annoyance, that will evoke a wry smile on Ms Smith's lips....you never know..."
5,An Appropriate Title,"""Finding Our Voices"" is aptly titled, for often those of us who disagree with a governmental policy are too timid to let our voices be heard. This film follows the courageous efforts of individuals who have not only found their voices but have used them to demonstrate the patriotic duty of all Americans to speak out against injustices committed by leaders of our beloved country."
5,Pure blues,"This is pure, original blues with Otis Spann and Robert Lockwood Jr. Every track is a joy, but ""Otis in the Dark"" alone is worth many times the price of the CD. This is one of those albums that will still be deeply rich the hundredth time you listen, and you will continue to listen!"
4,Blues and Early R&R collection.,I collect blues piano players and Otis Spann is one of the best although not so well known. I would like to get some of his sheet music.
4,"""The Oxford Book of English Verse""",This is a well-made and moderately priced book. I am sure that my grand-daughter will enjoy it!
4,Great if you like unusual jewerly,"This necklace looks like a fancy dog collar. However, It goes great with jeans and a jacket. It dresses them up nicely.It is hard to clasp somewhat though"
3,Intriguing first album,"Fans of Hiatt's later work may find this one a bit of an oddity. There's a curious mixture of folk, rock and country here, not very well produced, that doesn't quite gel. The title track is probably the best - suitably weird lyrics and music, and John sounds so young! So, it's a weird album from a young guy. Worst thing about it is the dull sound quality."
3,Real benefits or imagined?,"After a few weeks of use and $30 poorer, I'm not certain what I feel?It seems that I wake up more rested some of the time, but other times I feel tired and have a lack of energy?My Fibromyalgia pain, again feels better some of the time, but not all the time?I think it works, but maybe ""not as well as I was hoping""? I'm not sure?So, I think the only way to ""really know if it works or not"", is to stop taking the Taurox SB 6x when the first 25ml bottle is finished, and then see how I feel?This may be the only way to truly know if Tuarox provides real benefits or just imagined?"
4,SOMEWHERE IN TIME THER WAS DONNY,"This new release by Donny Osmond pays homage to the songs of the 70's and 80's. His rendition of the classic WITHOUT YOU is done in a very basic style with not a lot of instrumentation....Mariah Carey's version is still the best for that song but this one Donny does his thing on also! The standout tracks are DON'T DREAM IT'S OVER, AFTER THE LOVE HAS GONE, ALL OUT OF LOVE, HAPPY TOGETHER, PUPPY LOVE, and NO ONE HAS TO BE ALONE! The others are good but not as stellar as these remakes. Remakes are always a risky thing but Donny will not dissapoint his legions of fans....to all others, it really does not matter. By the way, there is a hidden 13th track after the end of the cd...so listen for it!! ENJOY!"
2,The guy can SING!!!,"I followed the dreadful LOVE SONGS OF THE '70s covers package, finding out about this pop cover songs package, which backdates 4-5 years. Oh, wow....Two GREAT songs, soulful in the best meaning of the word, groovin' band, just two gorgeous romps. Absolutely great vocals, killers, if too slick. You can hear the promise, that voice. Tracks #2 ""I Can't Go For That"" and #7 ""Would I Lie to You."" Give the guy the songs and the band, Donny has soul.Oh my, but the rest...that great high voice...and corporate adult contemporary syrup upscale convenience store muzak songs. Just wrong, wrong, wrong!A mouthful of onion, that kind of tears. Just ""wow."""
5,I've matured and so has Donny! A great collection of energizing songs!,"I have to say, I ""found"" the Donny Live DVD on his webpage and bought it. After so many years of not hearing or seeing Donny, I was blown away by how his music has matured; even the ""old"" songs like ""Puppy Love""! The American music world has been missing out on a terrific performer who has been continuously popular in the U.K. for years! I feel like I've been robbed all these years, but then again it's my fault. I knew what I liked back in the 70's and 80's and I should have known that with the caliber of performances then that he would still be great..if just given the chance."
5,AMAZING!,"This CD is a genuine treasure! Donny's voice is incredible throughout but two tracks in particular stand out and show his amazing range vocally, ""All Out of Love"" and ""Without You""--absolutely gorgeous renditions! ""Would I Lie To You"" is more upbeat and just plain wonderful! Even though these are covers of classic love songs from the 70's and 80's you feel like you are hearing them for the first time--Donny makes every song on this CD his own. Truly his best work to date--there's even a surprise at the very end (it's worth waiting for)!"
4,SOMEWHERE IN TIME THERE WAS DONNY,"This new release by Donny Osmond pays homage to the songs of the 70's and 80's. His rendition of the classic WITHOUT YOU is done in a very basic style with not a lot of instrumentation....Mariah Carey's version is still the best for that song but this one Donny does his thing on also! The standout tracks are DON'T DREAM IT'S OVER, AFTER THE LOVE HAS GONE, ALL OUT OF LOVE, HAPPY TOGETHER, PUPPY LOVE, and NO ONE HAS TO BE ALONE! The others are good but not as stellar as these remakes. Remakes are always a risky thing but Donny will not dissapoint his legions of fans....to all others, it really does not matter. By the way, there is a hidden 13th track after the end of the cd...so listen for it!!! ENJOY!"
5,IT WAS WONDERFUL FROM START TO FINISH!!,"This whole album is a wonderful, delightful surprise. Donny proves once again that he is as great as he ever was. I don't usually like remakes. Not ANYONE's. But Donny has changed my mind on his album, and that is not an easy task. I hope he continues with great success and I truly hope to hear more from him soon!!"
3,Disappointing,"I hate to say it, but this CD disappointed me. As a former staunch Donny Osmond fan, I used to think he could do no wrong. I now see he can. It's unfortunate, because the man has a wonderfully powerful and emotion-filled voice, but the choice of tracks for this CD only reinforces the prevailing opinion in today's audience regarding Donny; that he is a ""has been"". These songs are definitely in the ""has been"" category, and by virtue of his singing them, only shows that he too belongs there. And I don't believe he does, but I do believe his material needs a definite recharge and a shot in the arm. He's got a great ""pop"" voice, and could do modern hits beautifully, but the track choice here leaves a lot to be desired. If, however, you are a fan of these kinds of songs (""oldies""), you will love this CD."
2,"dig out your ""This is the Moment"" CD instead","I love, love, love Donny Osmond -- I received my first Donny album as a gift 30 years ago, and I've followed him ever since. I am apparently the only fan who doesn't like this release. After the magnificent ""This is the Moment"" I really expected more.His choosing to cover this collection of love songs from the '70's and '80's was obviously a labor of love -- he calls them some of his favorite songs. There just doesn't seem to be anything terribly special going on here -- it's all fairly average with a few nice moments and, unfortunately, a few karaoke-happy-hour moments.Throw what you will at me -- I will happily listen to ""This is the Moment"" and my vintage Donny until the next release comes out."
1,"Donny, what were you thinking?? Why do ""Muzak"" 70's songs?","Oh Donny...what were you thinking?? This album is absolutely horrendous! (Which is heartbreaking for me to say, as I'm such a huge fan of yours. I love everything you've ever done...except this.)Perhaps if you'd tried new, fresh arrangemets for these tired, tired 70's songs, it MIGHT have worked.But why pick songs that have been relegated to elevator/grocery store ""Muzak"" when there are so many great songs out there to cover??? (And adding insult to injury, to do them with arrangement virtually identical to the originals??) I don't get it.Perhaps next time Donny will cover some classic Motown songs with cutting edge arrangements (songs he performed extraordinarily well during the concert segments of the 70's ""Donny & Marie"" Show), Stevie Wonder or other songs. (Or even more Broadway tunes, such as ""I Dreamed A Dream"" from Les Miserables and other classic shows would have been wonderful compared to this.)"
4,Open Horizon,"""Breeze On By"" from Donny's 2005What I Meant to SayCD went to #2 on my personal top ten this year. I went back for ""Somewhere In Time."" Six years later, this disc offers great Osmond performances. Darryl Hall & John Oates' ""I Can't Go for That"" transforms into a soulful groove. Steve Beighton's blazing sax makes this one of the most addictive covers in memory. When Donny sings, ""I'll do anything that you want me to,"" it opens the horizons. Charles & Eddie recorded ""Would I Lie To You."" On this track, Donny's voice explodes, ""Everybody's got their history, On every page - a mystery; You can read my diary; You're in every line."" It's a classic track. ""Could It Be I'm Falling In Love,"" ""I'm Not In Love"" and the hidden track ""Crazy Horses"" are also excellent. This disc offers some classic interpretations by one of our best singers. Enjoy!"
3,Disappointed!,"I'm a Donny fan from way back. His voice is great on this CD, but I'd like to hear something original from Donny. He's going to turn into another Rod Stewart - singing everyone else's songs. And what is with the noise at the beginning of track two? That is awful. Good luck next time, Donny."
3,"Somewhere in Time, is lost in space","This new CD lacks in all the above, I'm was very disappointed. Hey, this guy doesn't need any back-up singers, his voice is natural. The song selection is ok, but could have been a little stronger, it sounds as if sometimes he is almost straining, to hit some notes."
3,Odds & Folk Gods,"Columbia raided the Dylan volts for this record, consisting of covers from the ""Self Portrait"" & ""New Morning"" sessions.Highlights are Johnny Cash's ""The Ballad of Ira Hayes"" & Jerry Jeff ""Bojangles""As a album of unreleased tracks it fine, & not as bad as Bob would make you think."
2,"Even if it's garbage, I still want to hear it...","C'mon, release this one. It can't possibly be that bad. This is the only Dylan album I've never heard. He never wanted it released (Dylan had briefly left Columbia for Asylum Records, and recorded Planet Waves for them, which is one of my least favorite Dylan albums), so Columbia retaliated with this album in 1973. It's never been released domestically on CD, and probably won't, but I think it should. I'm curious at least. I have heard Knocked Out Loaded, Down in the Groove (which I was playing the other day and it was even worse than I remembered), Dylan and the Dead (Dylan's worst), Under the Red Sky, or Self Portrait, and this one can't be any worse than those."
3,Dylan - 1973,"There are only two real draw backs to ""Dylan"". 1) I have a little trouble with some of the female backing vocals and 2) Being that this is now only available on cassette, there is a considerabe amount of ""hiss"" even on the very first play! Anyone who has been spoiled by digital quality sound will understand what I mean. With those two complaints aside, this is a really fun compilation of Dylan outtakes to listen to. Lily of the West truly is a fantastic song. I also enjoy ""Sarah Jane"", although Bob does sing a little off key on this one. I would definately reccommend any Dylan fan pick this up! Well worth the (low) price! I'll bet that if you appreciated Self-Portrait, this will be something you can sink your teeth into as well."
3,Just okay.,"This product is a little misleading. The description dosent mention that these gloves are made of vinyl on the outside and not leather. I was looking for leather when I purchased. I will probably just go an exchange them somewhere. The gloves them selves are perfectly acceptable. They have a fair amount of padding, with a wrist wrap that is just okay. Definately did not get what I wanted, but again, the listing was not very specific. I would say buy these if you will only get moderate use out of them."
5,Good ones,"After I place the order, the gloves arrived the next day. It was surprisingly fast. I tried them on during saturday spar training and they were really good. Although even the small size ones are too big for me, they still protective and comfortable."
1,Not the gloves in the picture,"OK so i bought these pair of gloves that i saw on the picture, but their's a problem their not the same!!! the ones i got came in a different color and less cooler looking...is it a scam? Buy it and get a a cheaper crappier version or did someone made a mistake posting the wrong picture. Everlast if your reading this, please answer me."
4,Good for the price,"I use these for working out and speed bag work, not for grappling or real mma. They do the job quite well. They took a while to break in but they do the job."
4,Pretty Good,These gloves are very comfortable and offer good padded protection at an excellent value. I use them daily and they have taken the abuse without a problem so far.
3,good product,i think this is a good product as it went along with the everlast bag and got good customer service
3,A bit small,"I bought some UFC gloves and my hands fit fine. These Everlasts are a bit tight, especially around the finger webs. If you read the reviews they're all pretty mediocre. I'd say ante up the money and get some quality. I'm not impressed with this purchase, even at $25."
4,NO 5 STARS,I ORDERED THE LARGE/X-LARGE BUT THE FINGERS PADDING ARE KINDA TIGHT AND NOT LONG ENOUGH. THE KNUCKLE PADDING IS GOOD THOUGH.
4,"great, but needs longer knuckles-coverage-for grappling but not for competition.",perfect! ...except I hit the boxing bag with it and my knuckle skin chafed off so I had to wear 2-3 bandaids for almost a week before it healed.I bought sports-tape for my knuckles at a drug-store so I don't get hurt next time I use them again.could be improved with longer fingers-coverage and a little padding on the thumb-knuckles too.This product's great cuz it has a little elastic on the underwrist so you can velcro on the wrist-guard part easier with your free hand. Almost 100% perfect pair of MMA gloves...non-leather so no animals got killed in the making of it; which also makes it less expensive to make and affordable for us. yehay!
2,I wouldn't recommend it,"I've ordered Large/Extra Large model, and barely can get them on (getting them off is even harder) even though my hand doesn't exceed what's normally considered Large. Threads are hanging from various spots, indicating poor manufacturing quality. Price was good, so I will use them until they break and buy another make/model next time."
2,MMA Gloves,"I tried to cut some corners (price wise) purchasing these MMA gloves.They're vinyl with the palm side bare (open hand).The gloves cut into the webbing of my finger.I purchase the ""Harbinger"" model MMA Gloves after, and what a difference."
5,Phenomenal Mess of an Album - GREAT!,"This was the first Butthole Surfers album I ever bought and it's incredible to hear it remastered on CD. All of the songs are experimental, weird, driving, deep (in a psychotic way) and well worth listening to while drinking heavily in a dark room... My fave tracks: the eerie ""22 going on 23"" with the ominous cows mooing at the end (on vinyl, this goes on indefinitely because of an intentional skipping loop) and the all too brief ""Weber"" which could very well have become much more of a twisted tune. I love this CD!"
4,Let's be serious ( no really ),"This band are quite frankly mad, but the music that's on display here is impossible not to like as it is damn groovy in an odd way. I think the track Kuntz is odd but it kinda goes well with the whole schizophrenic nature of the album.Buy it if you like to have a bit of humour in your music"
4,"not their best, but still bery good.","Actually, Gibby IS saying SOMETHING in ""The O-Men""-- it's just 95% unintelligable (I can pick out ""some of the time I hold it inside"" and ""I remember the time I could"" in there, but that's it). Ant ""Kuntz"" is Indian folk music that's been messed with a little bit. The BHS don't actually play any of it."
3,SATAN!,"Speaking as a person who took l.s.d. at the age of 3 I say that this Surfers album can be summed up with these words: dread, downer, durge, bummer, a BAD TRIP. It sucks. For masochists.The short duration of listening to this 30 minutes feels like an eternity of crap.So if you want to feel bad, exactly like a bad trip, then buy this. If you want to feel happy and glad, buy Hairway to Steven, Pioughd, or Worm Saloon."
5,Best Album Ever!!!,"This is the butthole surfers at their best. their rendition of the Black Sabbath song ''sweet leaf'' is better than the original. this is by far the greatest butthole surfers album ever, also Hairway to steven and Widowermaker! were really good weird but tasteful noise.good music to listen to while taking a dump. this is the butthole's 6'th recording,the previous 5 were more punk, this is an experimental album.this is the 1992 touch and go version of the cd.the remastered version contains less artwork, but the music is pure entertainment on both. it's interesting to check out.buy it if you don't have it, it will change your life. 5 stars+"
5,"I liked it, me too!","Reminds me of the time I took some adulterated PCP, then fell into a dream where I disemboweled a cow with a chainsaw, then filled the cavity with a litter of kittens, and eventually drove my car off a bridge onto a Liberian freighter whose crew sodomized me repeatedly until they finally docked in L.A., where I was arrested on outstanding traffic tickets. Only to come down & find out it was all true.It was a lot like that.Highly recommended music to conduct unholy experiments involving LSD, living flesh, and sharp instruments by."
3,GOOD,"I HAVE NOT USED THEM YET,I WRECKED MY CAR TWO DAYS AFTER I GOT THEM AND HAD NOT HAD THE TIME TO USE."
1,DONT BUY,"This product is very bad! I was trying to clean some head lights, and it messed up and scratched up the pumper! I must mention i've had a Detail shop for many years now and i knew what i was doing... try it at ur own risk! what you can do with this product is to use it on absolute flat surfaces. if there are any curves, there is a huge possibility that it will get scratch and ruined"
2,You get what you pay for,I should have bought the kind of buffer that screws into the face of the buffer. This kind flys off the face of the buffer.
2,Good & Bad = Ugly,"I have to agree with the review by 'Trucker' when he says the quality is poor. While the disk that screws onto the polisher is good and strong, and the velcro holds well, the pads have very little wool and it stops short of the edges, leaving the stitching showing around the edge. I did just what he was warning about...I gouged the surface of my boat by tipping the pad slightly. Once that happens you can't buff it out. It's almost impossible to polish in a recess or where the surface changes to a concave shape without getting that edge in there, and then, gouge!I would send them back except for the price, it's not worth the effort. But I'm looking for something better now.**Added later:I did send these back and got a refund from Amazon (way to go!)I recommend buying the [Makita 192629-7 7-Inch Hook and Loop Pad for 9227C Sander/Polisher] which is sold on Amazon. These have been working great for me. Read my review."
3,This type pad,"Been in ""the bussness"" for >40+ years, and the pads with the stitching around the outside edge should avoided,,, at all costs. They will bite a finish in a heart beat, even if you're experianced. Beleive this!!I will say the price is right for this offering and you could cut the edges off the pads and use them for hand applicators for glazes and waxs, the main velcro pad that goes on the buffer is well worth the price."
2,Disappointed,While the velcro backing pad appears to be decent the pads are the cheapest I've run across. Because they only go to the edge of the backing pad they leave the user with the very real possibility of gouging the surface with the edge. I admit I was not expecting the quality of a 3M wool buffing pad but this is a disappointment.
4,VERY NICE,"VERY NICLEY DONE WITH A HINT OF TORY AMOS , PORCUPINE TREE AND BLACKFIELD IN THE SONGS. I DO LIKE A LITTLE POP EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE. THIS IS'NT JUST ANOTHER RUN OF THE MILL MIDDLE OF THE ROAD COLLECTION OF BORING SONGS THAT YOU HEAR ON THE RADIO PRETTY MUCH ALL OF THE TIME.THE CHORDS ARE WELL PUT TOGETHER . WELL DONE !"
1,CRAP,Me and my friends would have done a better job with a camcorder. What a piece of garbage this movie is.. Watching this movie is sheer waste of time. I still dont belive I just went after the DVD cover and the raunchy scene shown behind the cover. Many Z-rated movies have better story lines than this one.
1,No words can describe how awful!,"First of all, I cannot believe that a piece of garbage like this would even get financed. Second of all, I cannot fathom that someone would distribute it. And third, I cannot believe rental stores would waste their space! This is Z-grade dreck!The ""movie"" appears to have been filmed on a camcorder. The editing is terrible. The acting is worthless. The script is juvenile. This is so bad it is not worth being PAID to watch it.I cannot say enough bad things about this, I watched maybe 10 minutes of the film. I want my $2.00 BACK!!"
4,Bond does it again!,"So far, Stephanie Bond continues to please, with her spunky heroines and her gorgeous heros. Even her secondary characters are fun. If you don't love Tuesday, something is out of kilter in your funny bone. As for the booted automobile, that was a little too close to home. Glad my rescuer did not come on a motorcycle."
2,Boring!,"I don't know how this book got so many good reviews. From the first chapter, I was bored out of my mind. The author spends entirely too much time describing EVERY LITTLE DETAIL, and that includes the unimportant characters about to be killed. Meanwhile, the main character is perfect. Absolutely perfect in every possible way. The perfect warrior, sorceress, leader, rebel, and mother. Not to mention the fact that she's exceedingly beautiful. I can't remember another character who annoyed me so much just by being her wonderful, arrogant self. The only reason I even gave this book two stars instead of one is because at the end, you finally get to see what part the sorceress Nyadnar has in all of this. That part was creative, but the rest was just plain dull. Try to avoid this title unless you feel compelled to read every single Forgotten Realms title."
1,If you like this Realms book then you are on crack,Decent good guys but what drunk wrote the story. How did the Zhentarim get dragged into a story that some many holes in it. The book should be called the Realm book that no story written just for the money potential. Realms fans are sadly ripped off by this Harpers series wannabee.
2,Not as hoped,The last roll of gaffers tape I had was a cloth backed type from 3M. It stuck beautifully and was waterproof without leaving a residue. This is more like a duct tape with a plastic backing. I wrapped it around some tubing and used it outside on a nice sunny day. It unpeeled from itself in a couple hours. It does not meet my expectations and was not a good value.
2,Ineffective gaff tape,This is not professional-quality gaff tape. It balls up easily but tears poorly. It leaves residue behind and then doesn't hold well. And it smells funny. Substandard quality.
1,Electrical tape is not what I ordered,I thought I was getting gaffers tape which is what it appears to be from the ad. But it seems more like electric tape not the cloth like gaffers tape. Gaffers tape is smooth and wen you don't you scissors to cut it looks like you cut it with scissors. This items is not good. Maybe for an electrician or a plumber. It's being shipped back. No wonder why it was so cheap.
4,"Oh, Donna","The more I listen to the Dead, the more I notice when Donna's not there _ roughly before 1972 and after 1978. Yes, she screeches, yes, she's not Bonnie Raitt, as she demonstrates on her Raitt-like solo on this one. But somehow, she provides a subcontext that's missing in some of the Dead's other work. (Not counting the Pigpen era _ that's a whole other story.)That's why I like this CD. Jerry is Jerry. Those of us who like him will buy almost anything that's released (more than 30 CDs of some kind since he died 5 1-2 years ago). This is good Garcia, good song selection and some great stuff _ I happen to like his version of ""After Midnight'' better than Clapton's because it's more spontaneous. (By the way, Clapton didn't write it, J.J. Cale did). He was at his best from 74-78 and I'd like to hear more of the JGB from that period.Still, for whatever it's worth, Donna makes this different."
4,It's a Keeper! Let's hope for more.,I am glad to see this edition of the JGB getting a full scale archival release. The sound is together and the performance is wonderful. Lots of tasty playing. I can't wait for the next one.
2,Don't You Let This Deal Go Down!!!,"I love the JGB and I am genuinely excited about upcoming releases, but this recording didn't impress me. I think the problem was the band line-up. I know the cast of characters changed over the years, but this is a weak ensemble compared to Keystone, Legions of Mary, and the 1991 self-entitled masterpiece. The bottom line for me was that I've heard better versions of these songs performed by different personnel. I hope to hear Legions of Mary material with Martin Fierro on horns as well as Merl Saunders. That's top shelf JGB. By the way, I returned the cd."
2,dreadful grate,"SLOOOOOOOOOWWWWW. The songs go from slow to slower. Donna can't sing live, never really could, no matter what the ""music fan"" below says. Granted it was ths sound system (supposedly). But was she really that much better in the studio. Keith was a great addition to the Dead and Garcia Bands sound (until the last year, when he seemed asleep at the wheel most of the time). This is hardly the best to be found, of any of the parties involved. Save 5 stars for when they are deserved. They become meaningless when thrown around too often."
3,"Don't think ""ripping.""","If you are considering this purchase, think ""Reflections."" Don't think of tapes and disks featuring Melvin, Merl, or Legion of Mary. Don't EVEN think of that insane ""After Midnight"" on your Union, NJ tape.Jerry's solos have that sweet slowness to them...precise and rolling. Jerry's singing is soft and sweet, but Donna is conspicuous throughout. Kahn is simply awesome. I bought it because I like ""Reflections,"" but apparently I need that sweaty, heavy-metal Jerry from live CD's. No blistering crescendos on ""Don't Let Go""!Outside of the ""Knockin'"" and the ""Sitting In Limbo"", I'm not finding many treats on these disks. I'm afraid this CD will find it's way to the mere curiosity section of my cherished JGB material."
4,Love Will Make You Do It,"The song ""That's What Love Will Make You Do"" is worth the cost of the album."
5,Classic Garcia,"Release of Jerry Garcia`s ""extra-curricular"" work is long overdue. This CD contains some of the finest melodic performances of his career. The combination of Jerry`s frail, sensitive voice along with his soothing,enticing guitar notes makes one long for days past when one could purchase a ticket for a Garcia Band concert for $5 and hang out on a pier in Asbury Park with a few peace loving Dead heads from Toronto, San Antonio, Jersey City, and who knows where else...enjoy some good food and a whole lot of good music.To the new breed of Dead fans...You are in for an incredible musical treat...""You shouda been there!"""
4,Georgia Dead Head/ JGB fan,"Well,,, I thought this was an excellent cd from start to finish.Jerry is so smooth in his playing and Donna doesn't let you forget she is there..Is that good or bad..? Many cd's of the Dead but this is my first JGB cd and, I shall have many more.."
1,Where the ... is the Eleanor Rigby jam???,"This CD puts me to sleep, just like the '76 Dead. Deadheads need a vault release of After Midnight >> Eleanor Rigby >> After Midnight from the winter of '80. That tour cooked as well, though in some ways looking back, the era had ominous plentiful signs of the smack-attack years ahead. Rock Scully - where are you and your tapes?? Nothing much will satisfy 'til we all get to hear that jam in hi-fi. Sorry, I've been asking for years...."
4,"Superb, often overlooked period for the Garcia Band...","This album contains some of the most delicate, carefully executed playing these ears have heard from Garcia & co. I've never been a huge fan of Donna Godchaux, but most of the vocal harmonies here are quite nice and, because of the vintage, Jerry's voice is much stronger than on any of the officially released JGB albums. The rendition of Jimmy Cliff's ""Sitting In Limbo"" is absolutely stunning."
2,WTF!,"She's Not There, Hold On, Winning, and All I Ever Wanted are not on their Greatest Hits CD? Seriously? Really?"
2,"Very Small, and not very nice.",It was just not what I wanted. The face is TINY and its too small for a toddler.
5,I Love this Book!,Had a copy I bought in 1980s through 2010. Missed it so much I had to get another through Amazon.
4,A Disturbing Story,I enjoyed reading this novel. It is not really a police procedural as the police play a small role. Nor is it really a mystery as we know quite early on who has commited the crine . Some people might find the story disturbing as it deals with crimes against children. The author is a very good writer and there is an atmosphere of menace through the book. The story jumps back and forth between the phsycopaths who have kidnapped a child and the distraught parents.Frankly I thought the parents considering there child has been stolen seemed to decend into self pity and I found the criminals to be more interesting.Anyway the book was quite good and I would reccomend it.
3,The Return of The Caravels,"The translation is terrible. The city of Lisbon is spelled ""Lixbon"", and other spelling errors abound. The reader is left to wonder if the author is purposely being opaque, or if the translator altered the meaning. Oter than that, it is a good read for persons interested in recent Portugese colonial history"
5,Hilaroius,"The Meatmen is an angry, offensive, crazy classic punk rock band from Michigan. They're musically good and very amusing. Anyone who is into the punk genre should check this band out!"
4,The Meatmen,"This is by far one of their worst albums, but it is pretty funny... Six more words required. Suck it."
1,Is This 5ive?,"What the hell happened with this single? Thid is complete repetitive garbage!! I really like 5ive but this song is completely dumb. The lyrics are not intellegent at all and the song is really bad. The other songs were OK, but were not up to 5ive's standard. If you are a fan and haven't heard this song, DON'T BUY IT! COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY! Why they picked it as a single is beyond me."
3,Hemp Wallet,"Well made wallet and should last a few years. I wish it had more pockets for storge, I have to use the Billfold pocket for credit card storage. This practice has already resulted in dumping serveral cards on the floor, unfortunately there is only 2 pockets for cards. But I must say it is very comfortable to carry in your pocket."
4,Similar to banging your head agianst the wall,"There's no doubt that listening to Big Black is a painfull, if not, masochisitic thing to do, but thats the point. They knew how to torture their listeners with brash guitars and chaotic melodies, unlike most bands that come around. When you listen to bands that just bang and yell, it comes off as just annoying and juvinile, but Big Black takes the cake for creating hell on an 8-track."
4,Terrifying,"And yet...unlike anything I've ever heard before. While this may be the antithesis of easy listening, somehow it seems there's a master to all this rage and noise. While I wouldn't call this party music or listen to this every day, it's easy to see that Surfer Rosa by the Pixies would not exist with this album and Atomizer (Especially ""Something Against You"", which after hearing the two albums almost seems like a Big Black impersonation). And for that influence alone, I have to admit this ""music"" (I have to use the word loosely here) isn't half bad."
5,The back door to this country...,"is two clanking, grinding guitars, a harelipped bass player and a drum machine named Roland. Its Big Black, kiddies, and this IS their finest moment. Three nerds blasting the most vicious, vitriolic post-everything music you're likely to come across. Whether you're looking for your next sonic challenge or just looking to discomfit people as they rifle thru your record collection, this is something you shouldnt pass up. They broke up as soon as they realized they were being recognized...how much more anti-commercial can you get, if thats what you like? Features a Kraftwerk cover, and a Cheap Trick cover...the rest of the songs are mostly about really bad human behavior. Too bad Amazon wont get offended when you ask for it by name."
5,Sonic brilliance,Big Black's finest hour was also their swan song. It's amazing to think that it's 10 years old already; it still sounds new and frightening.
4,hey Brandi,"go back to listening to The Backstreet Boys ya goody two shoesthis album rules, Albini is a genius."
2,"Great title, doesn't back it up musically","Industrial pioneers is what some guy said about this in his review about this album. Who are you kidding son? This thing is way overblown in terms of notoriety and yes I have listened to it a half a dozen times throughout to make sure I wasn't the joke. There are countless bands/artists who have contributed to this type of flair who deserve the respect far more than these guys. Since we are dealing with Mr. underground Steve from Montana then there must be something special about it however. This is hipster ""industrial"" plain and simple that would belong to someone whose ""craziest"" album is this. If you're into machinelike drums, dissonance, screaming, weirdness/artiness, you're gonna have to dig a lot harder than this. 2 stars for the title even though it is a little bit 3rd grade in the cover art dept."
1,NOT WORTH IT,"400 Trademarks on GlassI wish I had read the reviews before I bought this book. I got more information looking at other websites and writing their information down. Again, there is no mention of the copyright date on the description. Why aren't makers listed in alphabetical order, didn't they think that would have helped in researching. It was cheap enouogh, I am not going to bother returning it, but I will read reviews before I buy next time."
3,400 Trademarks on Glass,"I bought this book to supplement Toulouse. I have not used it yet, but I do know I have not seen some of these trademarks. I think it was a good buy for the price, that's for sure."
4,400 Trademarks on Glass,The book was in good condition and contained good information. Only one thing could have been in the listing -- the date of copyright. It was an older book (1992) than I thought it was.
5,the modern ''dark side of the moon''?,"the [...]surfers are pure genius. they sound like pink floydfrank zappa,& black sabbath warped in a hellish bath of acid.this album opens with ''jimi'' which sounds like someone being molested by satan himself.''ricky'' is a more normal track, so is ''rocky''. the other songs are funny and weird, probably their 2'nd best album. 5 stars+"
5,"""Some of her best"".","A wonderful combination of great songs and one of the best female voices on the planet.I own several of her albums, cassiettes and CDs. She has the tendency to 'yell' or 'holler'now and then, which is troublesome and negatively affects my ability to enjoy everything sherecords."
1,i agree no track list = no buy,"i too have been fustrated by the same problem. if you want us to buy, at least list tracks if no samples."
1,Linda Ronstadt Karaoke,Is it asking too much to have the songs that are on this CD listed? How can you decide if you'd like to buy it?
4,Great book to learn OO,"This book is the first attempt by Robert Martin to condense his OO design ideas to one spot. Since this book, he's done two more that have the same topic but use Java and C#. While the other two have far more mature thinking behind them, this book presents a number of topics for people new or hostile to OOP. His later books assume you believe OO is right and true.- it starts with an argument and explanation for OO- has a discussion of paradigm differences between OO and other styles- Explores good C++ style and organization that later works don't.In short, if you're doing C++ and don't know these concepts, read this book."
1,I knew it would fall off,I knew this holder would fall off and in 2 days it was on the floor. 2 sided tape is how it is designed to mount. The holder is great but you cant mount it on the wall.
4,I bought 4 of them for our Travel Trailer,"I bought these organizers to keep the clutter down in the small space while camping. I have a total of four of them. Overall I really like them, but one of them will not stay on the wall. The other three are perfect. We put our wallets, sunglasses, keys, cell phones, Ipods, nintendo DS, tv & radio remotes, medicine, well you get the picture, in them. I plan to order at least two more. They helped with knowing where our stuff was as we were running in & out of the camping during our trip. I would recommend these to anyone looking for a space to hold items, rather in a camper or at home."
4,!,"The ZZ Top cover is worth the entrance fee alone.All together now:""Just got paid today, got me a pocket fuuuull of change""Great stuff,"
3,Dah.......,"This is the worst Albini band, hands down. It starts off with a bang and ends with about 40 minutes of misery. The best thing about this band was the name (if you don't know who the Rapeman is, this probably sounds like a horrible thing to say). Just buy the 2 7""s and forget about the LP and EP."
4,A very unique album,"I think I'll always have a special place for this album. It has this anger and frustration that completely grabs hold of you, forcing you to acknowledge it. The guitar is a trebly mess, the bass is similar to that of jesus lizard (duh), and the drums are very high energy, and give the music direction. my personal favorite on this album is 'trouser minnow"". the vocals and guitar are amazing in this song, full of desperation and sexual frustration.buy it"
4,Noisy gets,"Why on Earth Albini shunned this album I'll never know. Chock full of salty gallows humour and nasty noise, it's a winner. Pure dense, maaaan. I much prefer this to Big Black. Features the live ""Budd"" ep too, which boasts one of the best screams of a profanity yet committed to vinyl. Don't screech along with this whilst you're wearing your iPod. It'll give your mam an aneurysm. What a bonus."
5,wait till I start nautilus,"My personal favorite of the Albini bands. Dave Sims' bass is monstrous on songs like ""Up Beat,"" ""Trouser Minnow"" crawls and creeps with barely restrained aggression, and there's a fantastic cover of ZZ Top's ""Just Got Paid.""Kinda sleazy, kinda scary, kinda off-putting to folks who can't grasp the confrontational irony which informs Steve Albini's bile."
5,Absolutely the Best!,I love to cook Chinese food; and a particular favorite dish is chicken or shrimp with hoisin sauce. Koon Chun is difficult to find in local stores; but it is far and away the best hoisin -- both in terms of flavor and consistency.
5,Works Great,"This product is made for babies, but it's also excellent for use on adults who have incontenince. Urine can burn the skin and cause pain and discomfort. This stops the pain and irritation very fast and protects the skin for hours. It is a little hard to use because it is very thick and difficult to get on the fingers for use. But it's worth the inconvenience because it works so well. I bought the 16 oz size because I thought it would last a long time."
1,"TERRIBLE company!!! I never received my purchase, but they charged me","The product comes through another company, which is E-WorldDirectInc. I bought a Balmex for my baby on October. Now is end of November & they did not send my purchase!!! They've charged me for that though!!!"
3,Incorrect book enclosed,"Part of what helps with these clip art libraries that are so huge, is a good, easy to see printed book. This one said it came with two books and showed that they were of decent size. I received a very small, single book that is hard to see all of the artwork. It will be very hard to be creative with this small printed book."
3,Art Explosion,"Art Explosion is a valuable tool for clip art basics. It could use more silhouettes and less cartoons.The image library book, however, does not coincide with the discs!"
1,No!,Was extremely disappointed. Disks did not work in my Mac computer and I even ordered set for Mac. I am used to Clipart program through internet and it is so easy to work with but have to pay $125.00 per year. Was looking to save some $ but have decided to renew my subscription to Clipart.
2,"Art Expolosion 750,000 Expolded","Sure Art Explosion has nifty stock images that can help in a pinch with small graphic solutions, but what to do with 48 CDs that come shrink-wrapped on a spindle with no lid? In the past the CDs would come supplied with a carrying case. So don't expect one to come with this collection or to get a response from Nova even though they advertise a money back guarantee."
2,Deceived,"Buying this product I was replacing my current 750,000 Art Explosion that was on 48 CDs with this new version that was on 5 DVD and it had the promise that I could search the entire 750,000 pieces of art with an onscreen program. I was never to have to page through two huge book trying to find artwork, I would only need to type in key words and the options would be on my screen. Well guess what, it didn't work. What is even worse, the new book that replaces the old two books, has tiny thumbnails of all the art, it's really disgusting to look for something. To top it off, I got my set of DVDs and I got two #3's and no #4. It was a hassle to get them to say they'd send me out the #4 DVD. I should have received it by now. Purchase this if you are in great need of eps artwork."
2,Not that great,"I brought this product to use in my graphic design projects, and have got to say I'm disappointed. The content of the cds might be nice if I could ever access it. It takes FOREVER to open the folders on the cd, like almost over a minute and I'm using a brand new, very fast Mac Pro. And while it's accessing the cd it sounds like it's chewing up the cd player. Not great when you're on a tight deadline and every minute counts. The portfolio browser could be better too, the samples are pretty small, better than what is in the book they provided, but still, cumbersome to use, and some features of it make it crash often."
1,WORTHLESS PURCHASE,"Art Explosion 750,000 for Mac is a COMPLETE waste of money! The Portfilio 6 Browser is not compatible with Snow Leopard. Nova help tells me no update is on the horizon and to use it with another browser. This was not the reason I invested the money to purchase this software.This collection is a HUGE disappointment. Nova guarantees satisfaction - but you have to send the product back at your own expense to get a refund check for the purchase price - sans taxes and return shipping costs. Not a very good business practice.The collection is a waste of time and money! Don't bother!!!!"
2,A waste of money,"As a graphic designer, I'm always looking for tools like this. When I bought this for our shop, we were planning on using the icons for quick placement in our statement designs. We also looked forward to using the fonts and other clip art eps features for various quicky projects. Unfortunately, the interface is difficult to use, and loading the CDs is tedious.The stock photos are worthless. I have yet to use one of their 1970s photos for anything other than a good laugh.The font database has nothing usable.Overall, this was a waste of $100. Our shop has used it probably half a dozen times, and I don't imagine we'll use it much from here forward."
1,Amateur clip art collection is a waste of money.,"Art Explosion 750,000 for Mac is a waste of money! The collection comes with a crippled version of Extensis Portfilio 6 Browser. It is very, very slow! Finding the image you're looking for is a chore, even on a fast MacBook Pro! The first two DVDs I tried mounted, but the third did not. I tried it in two different Firewire DVD drives - nothing. Defective out of the box.Vector clip art resides on the first two DVDs. Image quality is poor - most are badly drawn cartoons. I've seen many of these images from other collections, such as PrintMaster (for PC). While this clip art be okay for children or flyers to promote the neighborhood garage sale, it is not good enough for business use.This collection is a HUGE disappointment. Nova guarantees satisfaction - but you have to send the product back at your own expense to get a refund check for the purchase price - sans taxes and return shipping costs.This collection is a waste of time and money! Skip it."
5,Much Better Than My Crappy JVC,Finally! I found a good stereo system for my room. Very easy cd changer. Very cool color (black and red) and cool design. Good sound and not huge. The two things I like best about it is that it plays MP3 cd's and it has an AUX connection so I can connect my iPod to it.
2,Touchie Feelie Sham,"Typical California feel good self-help schlok. Blaming the victim for not getting in touch with his feelings earlier (and of course not paying someone like Sonkin to ""help""). Generally muddled pablum."
5,Grandaughter LOVES IT!,"My grandaughter just turned 1 yr. old and I purchased this CD a month ago. Her parents keep it in the car and it helps keep her entertained and they say she LOVES it! They brought her over last night and I put it in my CD player. She stopped her playing on the other side of the room and came and stood where it was playing. She was dancing and enjoyed me singing along with the songs. I was showing her some hand motions to ""The wheels on the Bus"" and ""Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star"" and she stayed with me until it finished. My kids said the price was fantastic as they had checked on some of the CD's previously. This was a great purchase! The price was right and the CD was in excellent condition as described. I would recommend this one definitely."
5,"This is the 2nd time around for us, our now 3yr old wore out the first one... Get this CD!","We are on our 2nd time around with this CD, our now 3 yr old wore out the 1at one! You need this one in your kids' CD case~"
4,My daughter loves it... and that's what counts!,"After the first time my 2-year-old daughter heard this CD, she wanted to listen to it again and again. I hoped it would die out, to be honest... it's not a very adult-friendly CD. The voices can be a little on the irritating side, along with their overly-perky dialogue. But her love for this CD would not die.Every time we are in the car, she calls out, ""Put Little People on!"" And so it grew on me. A little. It has very positive messages for kids, and is full of praise whenever one of the Little People finishes a tongue twister (""That was so good, Sarah Lynn!"")What I know is that it gives my daughter a lot of joy to listen to these songs, and to sing along to classics kids' tunes like ""Itsy Bitsy Spider,"" ""Hole in the Bottom of the Sea,"" ""Pop Goes the Weasel,"" and ""Who Too the Cookie from the Cookie Jar?"" So no matter what I think, the CD is a winner.I'll just wear headphones. ;)"
5,Excellent for children,My daughter asked for this CD after hearing it at her cousins house. She loves it and the whole family can sing along.
4,Great List of Classic Kids' Songs and Well Done!,"I have a toddler who LOVES music. She's been singing pieces of the old classics to me but I couldn't remember the words to them since it's been so long so I was having trouble trying to sing these songs for her. We have a few kids' CDs that are just annoying (the voices and the music make me crazy) and the song collections just weren't very good. My mom bought us this CD and wow! It has every song I remember ever singing when I was a kid and it's nicely done. I can totally live with this music. Best of all, my daughter loves it and we have a ball singing together with it.Would highly recommend!"
4,This is our 2nd one!!!,My daughter loves this tape so much I need another. She can sing along with all of the songs clearly at 20 months old. She will even do the hand movements for itsy bitsy spider.As far as the other response - it's not about the adult - it's about the child - and it's obviously had a VERY positive influence on both of us.
3,Stolen and resent.,The product has been stolen during shipment: I only have the empty package. After writing to Amazon they immediately sent me a new copy: this is great!
2,ANNOYING!,"Although the songs are very cute, the ""kids"" singing get to be annoying. They have conversations between the songs and they just sound so fake and scripted. I have 50+ cd's for our daughter and all of the fisher price little people ones make me bonkers!"
1,Nothing Mounts on the CETME,"The CETME does not have a tab on the rear sight extension like the HK-91 or PTR. Therefore, no claw mount will properly mount an optic to the CETME without sliding forward upon firing.I've read some reviews on other sites that state that this is the ONLY claw mount that will work on a CETME. Not true. There is no mount, claw or otherwise, that will work on the Spanish crap. You would be better off finding someone who could braze or weld a rail to the top of the receiver than wasting money on this contraption."
1,Puhlease!,My advice--don't waste a dime or your time. This book could have been done by anyone with or without experience in retirement planning. It is so elementary Amazon should remove it from their offerings.
1,What a waste!!,"Look, I only gave this one star because I couldn't go any lower. This is nothing but sickningly sweet top-forty garbage. It has nothing to do with country and I'm offended that people think it does. Is this the backstreet boys with cowboy boots? I'm sure that if everyone buys it though people will be so wrapped up it's dulcet tones that all war will stop and people will all get along. This isn't music but Robbie Fulks is, get that."
5,excellent for all the things that are happening in the world,excellent content for all of the violence that is happening in the world today. With all of the school shooting in the US in the past few months we really need some senseless kindness brought back in to our everyday lives. Instead of all the hussel and bussel. I cried the first time I heard this song and still get chills every time I hear it. I saw billboard sign the other day and it said...That thing love thy neibor I meant it...----GOD I really wish this song would go up in the billboard charts . It has a bold statement.
5,Excellent tool when evaluating Human Rights Education plans,"A valuable compendium of essays from international professionals discussing the substance, methodologies and thematics of human rights education."
2,Worr Paint Domination Paintballs,"I shot these paintballs through a flatline barrel and they repeatedly busted in the barrel and were shooting all over the place. I put on an 11"" barrel same thing busting and shooting all over the place."
4,Lamb - Bernard Mac Laverty,"I had to read Lamb by Bernard Mac Laverty as a school projet. At first I was really un-keen as it wasn't my kind of book , but by the second chapter I was totally hooked. the only thing better than this book is the film."
4,Good debut,"Songs such as ""Journey from Mariabronn"", ""Apercu"", and ""Belexes"" are great prog jams, but are a little more rough around the edges than most of Kansas' later songs. ""Lonely Wind"" is an awesome bittersweet ballad, but not at all sappy. A very strong opening album for the band, but they would get better!"
3,"A mixed bag, but innovative for the time","This is Kansas' first LP, recorded in 1974 suffers from ham-fisted, canny production, much like Aerosmith's rushed debut two years earlier and Cheap Trick's first effort, a few years later. Steve Walsh's earnest vocals and Robby Steinhart's frenetic violin playing shine through the muddled mix. However, tracks like ""Bringing It Back,"" an ode to drug smuggling, probably sounded hilariously out of date a few years after the album was recorded, let alone today. Highlights include the melodic chorus of ""Lonely Wind"" and opener ""Can I Tell You."" Epics like ""Journey from Mariabronn"" are competently executed, but some of the riffage does become repetitive."
4,contains two of their best songs,This whole cd is very good but two songs apercu and journey from mariabronn are among kansas best songs. lonely wind is the next best song on the cd. I don't understand why apercu isn't on any of the collections because it is very good.
1,What I Ordered Was NOT What I Received,"I have a Marlin lever action .45-70 and wanted snap caps to practice cycling the action and trigger pull. The picture shown for this item sure look like rifle cartridges to me, but when I received them they were a different look entirely (and basically just a bit longer than .45 ACP rounds, although slimmer). I'm not going to bother seeing if they'll work in my gun; I'm going to return them. They were NOT the rifle cartridge-looking things you see in this description."
1,Very Cheap Manufacture....,"I needed a crib bumper to match my crib set and this was the only white one I could find at the time... Well, terrible choice, I should have waited. The material seems soooooooo cheap, it's not sturdy at all and does not prevent my baby from sticking her legs out, it does not go all the way around my crib, and mine is standard even a little smaller than average. It already needed to be repaired.I would not recommended this product at all."
4,Charlotte's Web gift set,I purchased this kit to show my grandchildren an earlier version of this classic before we went to see the new one. Was well worth the price and time.
4,A huge hit!,"I had a great time with this costume. It was a huge hit with everyone I encountered while in Kansas City, MO. Thank you!"
4,How Sad... The Airbag,"Nothing like fixin' up an older car & finishing it off with a fresh new wheel from GT. The quality & price value is second to none.My wheel buying days have slowed sadly due to the invention of the airbag. Grant really needs to make an ""off road"" kit that would allow the removal of the airbag allow for the & installation of a classic GT wheel.I bought this wheel for my 95 Jeep Wrangler YJ. The fit & finish was flawless, this wheel should have earned a 5 star rating. The first one I ordered was missing the horn button logo. I sent it back only to receive a second one with the same problem. I called Grant directly, the were very apologetic & sent me a new GT logo to install on my wheel.The service from Grant was second to none & Amazon was top notch in returning & replacing the wheel. Very impressed."
1,Product did not corresponded to Amazon's description.,Amazon's description did not correspond to the product we actually received. Unforgivable.This is total bummer not only for the deception but the time and money you need to spend in returning the product (specially when it weights over the normal items).
5,A Classic!!!!,"You can argue all you want to about who was the best Mama Rose (Angela Lansbury in my opinion), but the fact remains that Gypsy is one of the best American musicals ever created. The overture is by now classic, the rest of the score perfection. Ethel Merman was electric and unforgettable creating the original Rose, and the rest is history. It is the role that every Broadway leading lady wants a crack at and most suceed admirably (except perhaps Tyne Daly who was not capable of performing the role and should have stuck to television mothers).A great score, Jule Styne's music is wonderful and Sondheim's lyrics are masterful! A must have album for any theater collector."
4,Surprised,"I ordered these and they were hard to find!!! When I opened the package, I wasn't thrilled. The sheets looked handmade but when I unfolded them, I saw that the bottom half was fitted. GENIUS!"
5,Greatness!!,"Awesome, especially ""Dream"", this live version never gets old. Been diggin' this same recording for 20 years."
4,Great to have in Mahavishnu Collection,"So far not really happy with the sound quality. However the arrangements are interesting and as with all early Mahavishnu, ""one must take sips from the cup to develop a taste before one can gulp it down""."
1,NOT IN STOCK,"This Item IS NOT in stock. Be warned I found out the hard way. I ordered on Saturday, received an email stating my account had been charged, then received another email stating the item was no longer in stock and the money would be credited to my account. Tomorrow is the fourth of july so if I'm lucky I'll have MY money back in my account in time to order from someone who actually has true advertising on their website. Unfortunatley, it may be too late to receive these items in time to give them to my bridemaids. Thanks The Sportsman's Guide and Amazon.com for taking money from my account without checking to see it the item was in stock. They certainly can take your money quick enough, but it takes them 3-5 business day to credit your account. Nice customer service."
1,Waste,"Get what you pay for here. Poor sound quality, has two plugs - only works with computer, not music players- and an overall. Waste of money."
5,Best there is.,"I've had everything from the cheapest medical catalogue bulk order special ears to the midrange sprauge's and littmans, the master cardio blows them away. Ambient noise is not a factor with these. Being at the scene of an emergency or in the back of a squad I can still auscultate clearly without sirens or screaming getting in the way. Recommended if you're serious about your profession. Buy once, cry once."
5,The Best,I bought this scope in 1993 when I was in nursing school and worked on a cardiac stepdown in Ann Arbor. It was perfect for me for two reasons: 1. I have slight hearing problem and 2. Sometimes cardiac pts are hard to hear when in failure. This scope made it so I could hear everything. I love it and wouldn't use anything else. Even with a very slight hearing loss I can hear everything.
4,Great Product for a Great Price.,"Anyone who is a healthcare provider is aware of the quality of Littman's stethoscopes, especially the Master Cardiology Stethoscope. Auscultating pulmonary and cardiac sounds are a breeze with this tool. I love not having to turn the head of my stethoscope over to the bell side to listen for murmurs."
3,Pricey,"I brought this stethoscope because I was struggling with hearing heart murmurs with my cheaper stethoscope. Unfortunately, I still can't hear them with this pricier stethoscope."
5,Quality Product,"Bought this stethoscope for my wife who is a Intensive Cardiac Nurse and she says its the best stethoscope she has every used. Great in quality, perfect for the hospital setting"
5,Good 3M product,"The Littmann family is the best stethoscopes around and it is no different with this one.Would recommend to anyone looking for a top quality, nice looking and durable stet."
2,item looks differently,"The stethoscope, I got looks different from what I ve ordered...dont know why, but that is not what on pic. So, now in doubt if I got the right item."
5,Great Acoustics,"I traded in my littmann SEII lightweight stethoscope for this one and I'm amazed. The acoustics are so good. I can hear breath sounds and heart tones in noisy environments with ease. My assessment is a breeze with this tool. Definitely worth the money, if you can't hear, or don't trust your scope to give you reliable sounds how can you make judgements about your patients status? I'm really happy with it.I wasn't sure how the color would come out, it's hard to tell with the pictures what the difference is between the smoke and the black edition. I'm very pleased. The chest piece and ear tubes are charcoal in color, very sleek and nice looking. Couldn't be happier with my decision to buy it :)"
4,Excellent sci-fi!,"Eric Frank Russell is a terrific science fiction writer and storyteller. While his short stories often end weakly, I didn't find the same to be true of his novels.The only thing keeping him from a five-star rating in my book is that he never really develops the characters, just leaves them as people with little or no personality. When I read fiction that has really good character development, I find myself missing the characters for a few days after I finish the book. When I finish an E. F. Russell novel, I can barely even remember the characters!On the other hand, the stories are superb and contain many interesting ideas and scenarios. Definitely a book worth adding to your library."
2,Ipod Nightmare!,"I went to Best Buy to check this item out and could only get Audio out of my Ipod, it would not transfer the picture to the screen. 2 Best Buy Reps looked at it and neither one had a clue what the problem was.I tried installing it, uninstalling it a few times and couldn't get the video to work, and I made sure all the Ipod settings were correct.I have an Ipod about 2 years old...60 gigs. I'm not sure what ""generation"" it is but it clearly did not work in the Philips player after numerous attempts. I will agree that the picture when playing a regular DVD was just ok and not great but I was willing to overlook that for the Ipod feature. Unfortunetly I couldn't even get that far with this product, I'm not sure if my Ipod is not compatible or if the switch toggle that connects the Ipod to the unit was defective but I sure wasn't going to buy one and bring it home to find out the hard way."
3,So much potential... wasted,"I knew someone who had a fully-functioning version of this product and it seemed great and innovative, something that everyone should have... Then I bought my own.It's an A+ concept and design, but D for delivery.The i-Pod docking works fine for me, but the battery does not charge, so the DVD player is not portable, which defeats the purpose of a PORTABLE DVD player.I'll probably give mine away or sell it for a fraction of what it's worth if and when I can.Such a shame, because I really liked the overall versatility of the product, it just doesn't deliver as it should."
2,"I have the 7"" model","I thought that this item looked like it would be pretty awesome, since it plays so many different formats. One problem, if you listen to the player through with the headphones, you can actually hear the motor spinning the disc. The only way to not hear it is to blast the volume till you can't hear anything anymore. I exchanged it, and found the same problem on the second one. Philips wasn't much of a help either."
4,"Nice product, my daughter likes it","I bought this for my daughter's b-day from Best Buy. The sales guy told me that any MP3 player can be used. I think he is wrong, only IPods work. So this feature is useless to my daughter since she does not have an IPod. But she does like it and she may buy an IPod later."
1,Lousy tech support for obvious problem,"I received this as a gift. I was so psyched! Then I tried my new 120g ipod. No video. Then I read the directions. Ok, doesn't support that one. Tried my husbands 80g. It's supposed to work. It didn't work either. So I called tech support. Three times. No one ever asked if I was using a new ipod classic. Mostly they put me on hold or repeated back my information to me. Finally, it was confirmed that it was a compatibility issue with Apple and this device. That's two hours of my life wasted.DO NOT BUY IF YOU HAVE A NEWER IPOD!"
4,How to set the display to fullscreen mode,"Since this isn't in the documentation, I thought I'd pass it along here:1. Stop the DVD (or iPod video), if one is playing.2. Press ""Setup"" on the remote.3. Highlight ""TV Display"" and press ""OK"".4. Highlight ""16:9"" and press ""OK"".5. Press ""Setup"" to exit the menu."
3,THIS PLAYER DOES NOT PLAY IPOD 160GB CLASSIC,While this player will play my IPOD video 30 GB...it does NOT play IPOD 160 GB Classic models. I even took this player to the Apple Store and they confirmed that it can't be played in this deck. Bummer! No one says this in the fine print...I assumed and IPOD was an IPOD...so this is my caution to you.
4,Great Portable but no SDHC Support,"We bought this product refurbished a little unsure about how it would turn out. So far it's been a wonderful player. We love the swivel screen (something we didn't know about before hand) that turns this player into a tablet style portable DVD player. We also love the fact that we can play videos on the iPod, DVD or an SD card. The only disappointment so far is the fact that this player won't support SDHC cards. Pretty much anything over 4gbs isn't useable. That would have been good to know before I invested in an 8gb SDHC card."
1,THIS ITEM HAS FALSE ADVERTISING ! DO NOT BUY!,"WE PURCHSED THIS DVD PLAYER FOR OUR DAUGHTER FOR CHRISTMAS ALONE WITH THE NEW VIDEO NANO.....ONLY TO LEARN THAT IT WILL NOT PLAY THE NEW IPODS ! NO WHERE ON THE BOX DOES IT TELL YOU THAT IT WILL ONLY PLAY THE OLDER IPODS . WE ONLY FOUND THIS OUT AFTER READING THE MANUAL INSIDE AND CALLING PHILLIPS. TALKED WITH TWO PHILLIPS CUSTOMER SERVICE REPS AND THEY BOTH BLAMED THE PROBLEM ON WAL-MART (WHERE WE PURCHASED THE ITEM), SAYING IT WAS UP TO THEM (AND US) TO OPEN THE BOX, BEFORE PURCHASING, AND FIND OUT THIS INFO. ON THE BOX IT SAYS ""MADE FOR IPOD"". WE ASKED WHY THEY DID NOT PUT ""ONLY WORKS WITH OLDER IPODS"" AND THERE ANSWER STILL REMAINED THE SAME .....THE STORES FAULT!! NOW WE ARE PAST THE 15 DAY RETURN DATE AND ARE STUCK WITH A DVD PLAYER THAT WE PAYED EXTRA MONEY FOR. WE COULD'VE PURCHASED A DVD PLAYER WITH A LARGER SCREEN , FOR MUCH CHEAPER PRICE, IF WE ONLY KNEW !!!! PHILLIPS IS NOT TAKING RESPONSIBALITY FOR THEIR MISTAKE !!!!!!!!! DO NOT BUY !!!!!!!!"
2,Keep looking,"We thought this would be a great option for a trip with a small child. After less than two weeks of use, the video display started to deteriorate so that it was impossible to use at all. The unit is small, so if that is what you want, go for it. The construction leaves a little to be desired. I loved the size, nice and compact, easy to travel with, but it feels cheap. The remote does not stay very secure in the unit when it is stored. We never got to try it with the iPod, but since it won't even hold the remote in place, I would be nervous docking my iPod in the unit."
5,Just what I expected and more!!,This is a great product. It's a really good size for traveling. It's so compact with a large screen. We were looking for a DVD player to bring on the plane for our 1 year old daughter. This is a great size and what a great feature to have the IPOD docking station! We also use it in the car with a case that we bought from Target. I highly recommend this!!
1,Disappointing - not for newer Ipods,"I got this for Christmas. Went to make sure it worked with my Ipod before I left on a trip tomorrow. I could get sound but no picture. After making sure I went through the setup list TWICE I broke down and called Phillips. Come to find out, this machine is not compatatble with the newer Ipods because according to the tech support lady, Apple has locked the compatibality communication on the new Ipods and they do not ""communicate"" with this product. There is nothing to do except put it in the box and send it back. Sometimes Apple is a little too controlling..."
5,Great total package!,"I have had this DVD player for over a month now and continue to be impressed. No problems with any iPod or SD card video features, it can handle a supprising range of video formats. The DVD playback is very good even when on bumpy roads. The screen is bright and the LCD quality is top of the line. The black video iPod looks killer in the dock space too.I researched my player choice quite a bit, and this was by far my top pick!"
4,Not quite everything you need to know....,"It is what it is. Like all Haynes manuals, the writing presumes SOME knowledge on the part of the reader. Many of the task detail photos are close-ups and do a poor job of establishing spatial relationships between the object component and nearby components leaving the reader with a sense of ""OK. thats how thats done.. but WHERE is it?""That being said, its absolutely indispensable for working on this type of machine."
5,Perfect for the Triumph.,"The perfect book for working on your older Triumph, this book unlike my older copy has the 750 models right up to the end of Meriden production. very useful."
5,triumph repair,"For a beginners manual it is fine, If you are looking for more detail buy additional manuals. It needs more detail,"
4,Better than expected,"The only thing keeping this product from a 5* review is the center grate design. The pieces just don't fit the way they should and it makes for a poor look from underneath. The copper colors on the different elements all match fairly well and it is better looking then the pictures show. It is bright metal and looks polished, even though it has a brushed look in some of the pictures. Be warned, the box doesn't match what is inside; mine said satin stainless. Open it before you call upset."
2,It is OK,The real test is nothing like what is in this book. The problems are challenging and it is good idea to practice.
5,"A ""Must Read"" for every Teen","If you know a teenage girl between the ages of 13 and 18, you have to give her this book! Daughter, granddaughter, niece, neighbor, they will all enjoy reading this book. It answers many of life's toughest teen questions: Peer pressure, dating, smoking, clothes, self-esteem, and, most importantly, building a strong relationship with God and walking in their faith daily. Comments I have heard include: ""I couldn't put it down."" ""My mother and I both love this book!"" ""I'm a grown woman and I'm buying this book for me. I didn't have this kind of information available when I was a teen."" A Girl's Life With God, is practical, inspirational and easy to read. There's even a question and answer session at the end of each chapter to help girls remember what they read and apply it right away! It's great! What a blessing for every teenage girl!"
2,Ew....,"Unmixed, mostly cheesy vocal trance. This CD is definately geared more toward the MTV listeners out there (i rag on MTV a lot...i think for a good reason). Well, all i can say is...there are DEFINATELY better CDs out there."
4,An Intermediate Guide to SPSS Programming: Using Syntax for Data Management,"Purchased for a class.Well written text; clear and precise language with easy to follow examples. However, it is greatly over priced. Would recommend for anyone who has never used SPSS, but not for others. The $50 spent on this text would have been better spent towards another book on SPSS."
2,Just common sense,"This is a good book but it is very tiny and looks like something you'd pick up in the supermarket checkout line. It's a great pick me up but nothing incredibly life changing is in it - just simple common sense things to keep your cool, i.e. count to 10, etc."
3,"Not great, but not bad","This item was marketed as ""For Her"". As a man I just bought it because it fit my needs. I use it 5 days a week. The good part is this stepper is small, easily stored, and gives a good workout.The bad part is the cable does not last more than a year for my 185 lb male body. Perhaps it might last longer with lighter women. My advice: this device works, but the day you buy it, buy 2 extra cables.All the company needs to do is make the cable stronger for heavier men. And it would be a fairly good buy at $60us."
5,Excellent Prog,"This was almost how prog began with bands like Kansas, Rush and others. This album is a worthy good effort as their first album and it's very good."
4,"Great first outing, but....","Although this first release of Kansas was strong, fresh and unique it actually paled in comparision to how they sounded live at that time. I had the pleasure to see them in concert when this LP was first released back in like 1974, and all I can say is the concert was an order of magnitude better than this LP. Not to take anything away from this LP, which is in my opinion the best showing of any Kansas LP, it being more real, & straight forward with no radio fluff that the later hit generating releases would be chock full of. Check it out, you will be surprised to find another side of Kansas."
3,Before They Went Arena,"I actually recieved this record by mistake for x-mas about 25 years ago (I had requested Leftoverture)...Anyhow this record basically relies on the strength of 2 tracks ""Apercu"" and ""Death of Mother Nature Suite"" the rest is mediocre 70's progressive rock--not too far removed from eary Styx or early Journey before they too turned arena as well. The bonus cut however is a nice addition and pushes the rating up to 3 1/2...."
5,DARRENS CHOPPER COOK BOOK REVIEW,"IF YOU HAVE FOUND AN INTEREST IN CHOPPER BUILDING THIS IS AN EXELENT START. IT'S INFORMATIVE, ILLUSTRATIVE AND GETS TO THE POINT.IT DEALS WITH BASIC CHOPPER CUSTOMIZATION, SOME OF THE TOOLS YOU WILL NEED EVEN LEGALITIES AND MUCH MORE. A WORTHY ADDITION TO ANY CHOPPER ENTHUSIAST. I RECOMEND IT"
2,"great, but poor dvd quality","My kids love these Noodlebug dvds. But they are both scratched and skip and lose their sound. We've had them both for less than 6 months, my kids handle them no more than any other kids' dvds we have and these two are the only ones with problems. It's frustrating. Noodlebug is great. The skipping and jumping of the dvd is not."
3,choose color for you??,"That's crazy! I agree with the other review, I want to choose color. It looks like one might be purple stripes, I would buy that one if I could."
5,A welcome counterpoint to the original poetry,"The visually impressive artwork of Sheryl Getman offers a welcome counterpoint to the original poetry comprising Jack B. Jelinski's Water Like The Soul Of An Angel: Memoirs Of A Fisherman. Jelinski's verse celebrates an enjoyment and appreciation of the outdoors, and for the solitude and peace of mind to be found there. While Casting For Trout: The delicate, white-feather legs of a thistle seed/run upstream with the wind./The fragile physics of a miniature tumbleweed ballet/make it magically spin/against the weight of mountains/while standing still/until/this exquisite balance fails/and must wait to find its moment again/downstream from where you brace our feet/against the current's will."
4,MAXXUM 5 (an english viewpoint),"I read many magazines back in the U.K. e.g. What camera? and was impressed by the reviews. I was travelling to the U.S.A. for six months & I only wanted to carry one lens so I found a deal to purchase a Dynax 5(u.k. name) with a Tamron 28-200mm lens.What a fabulous combination.This is my first SLR and you can use it straight out of the box as a point & shoot. Picture quality is very impressive,so much so that it will flatter you. The more experienced and confident you get you can delve into the cameras more 'creative'modes.All in all,if this is your first 'proper' camera,have no fear.Downsides? Low light shots can sometimes be disappointing in auto mode,i.e.under or overexposed.Along with a lot of cameras of this type (lightweight,compact SLRs) it uses 2xCR2 batteries which have a shortish lifespan if you are using auto-modes & flash a lot.Otherwise, buy a polarizing lens,a tripod (and spare batteries!) and enjoy!"
3,"Great features, poor reliability","This camera has great features for the price, and I was extremely happy with the quality of the photos I took in the 3 days I had the camera. Then it started eating whole rolls of film. After contacting the manufacturer they would repair it and I would pay all shipping costs. I returned it to amazon instead."
5,"Small SLR, Big Features!!!","Just bought this camera from Amazon.com and came with no harm. The camera is pretty small, compared to Canon Rebel 2000 or the new TI and Nikon N65. I kind of have a big hand and this camera is actually for my wife who has a small hand so it's perfect for her. I chose this maxxum camera cause my friend has the old minolta SLR camera and still produces nice pictures. The EYE START module is nice, it'll follow your eyeball to the object you want to focus the most. It's really nice. I'm no pro but loves anykind of camera. Used to have N65, hated it, never got a single nice pictures, and it was so heavy. With this camera, you can taste what a pro-like results even you use the complete auto mode."
2,automatic does not beat manual,"I purchased this camera and was totally unimpressed. I bought this camera for its automatic features. The camera feels [inexpensive], but then so do most cameras these days. I have taken five rolls with this camera and the pictures don't look any better then the pictures produced by my wife's [inexpensive] pocket camera. I still own an old manual Pentax K1000 which blows this camera away. The automatic focusing on this camera is useless at night and the autofocus is not that sharp when there is adequate lighting. To my surprise many of the pictures were over-exposed when I had it on automatic. I was very disappointed. I'm sticking with my old reliable friend."
5,Great camera,"I bought the Maxxum 5 couple weeks ago. It is a great camera with lots of features that easy to use. The manual is easy to understand. I was amazed by the first roll. The photos were sharp and crystal clear. If consider buying a SLR, this is the one you may want to put on top of your list."
1,Not made very well,"Although the size was just what we wanted, this product is not made very well. We removed it from the shipping box and set it on the ground and the bottom weld immediately broke apart."
1,Don't waste your money!!!,"It is not worth your time, money or effort on this product. It is way too short once you bolt it to the car seat floor; the DVD player will sit about 6 inches from the ground. You'd do better putting the DVD player on a cardboard box than using this worthless piece of garbage. Then once you've opened the plastic bag, you've voided any chance to return it...DON'T waste your money!!!!"
1,Dissatisfied,I received this product and I am very dissatisfied. The product is extremely flimsy and would not hold my DVD player. I would like to know the steps to return this product ASAP. I would not recommend this product for people.
3,"Helpful, but ""typos"" are annoying- more corrections needed.","The cards review the basics of all of the areas of law as advertised- about 50 cards or so per subject. However, many cards (about 10% of the cards so far in my review of the MBE subjects) have ""spell checker"" type errors. I bought them from the publisher, and some corrected cards were included, but many errors remain. E.g.- the Contracts cards frequently spell ""promisee"" (the recipient of a promise) as ""promise"", which is at best distracting, and at worst a critical barrier to understanding of the rules. Overall the cards are a convenient way to study, and a good time saver versus writing out all of your own flashcards for the elements of causes of action, rules of law."
1,"Cheaply done, full of typos","I purchased these cards because I heard they were really helpful - am so disappointed. There are many typos, key words left out, and words typed over each other. Its as though no one ever bothered to proof them, even slightly. It makes simple law incomprehensible."
4,"A good study aid, though you'll need others","I used the card set to supplement the BarBri materials. I found it very useful in helping me get a handle on a subject before reviewing the BarBri notes. The cards also helped me remember a few difficult details and mnemonic devices. There are a few places where the cards' interpretation of California law seems outdated, and there are some typos and printing errors that ought to be rectified. On the whole I thought the card set was a worthwhile investment and I would recommend it, with the caveat that you ought not depend on the cards alone."
4,Very Helpful,"I got these a week before the bar exam and the best thing about them is that even when you're zoned out from studying you can just do a few of these while you watch tv or do anything at night. They are a good way to jog your brain, and often they point out things that are missed or glossed over in bar prep courses."
3,Paintball Heros suprizing!,Ok i have been paintrball for quite a while. I downloaded the demo to this yesterday it is pretty fun. The bad thing about it is that it is very cheesey. Like for example : Auto-matic pump guns and all the paintball splats look the same. Good buy for $6
5,I'd Rate This A 10 If I Could,"In my many years in car repair I have consistently found that Fel-Pro gaskets beat any other brand hands down. This auto trans pan gasket is a hard-formed pan-shaped frame coated with a durable soft ribbed rubber. The rear of the gasket will not jump out of place as you are starting the front screws or vice-versa. I have seen these pan gaskets used, then re-used, without leakage many times... although no one would recommend such a practice (wink wink). That I'm aware of, this would only be possible with a Fel-Pro. This is the royalty of gasket and seal manufacturers and well worth the extra expense. I have no financial interest in Fel-Pro, only professional appreciation for top quality gaskets and seals."
4,Perfect Fit,This was a perfect fit and I had no problems with any leaks. A very well made product from Fel-Pro.
3,"It's ok, if you get it in working order.","This is an ok stand. I would say for light use only. Some of the ball bearings stick and may have been damaged during shipping. The ones that did work were not high quality but got the job done. The roller worked well. However, you can not adjust the feet, so the stand rocked back and forth. This could be fixed by carrying a deck of cards around with you and place an appropriate amount of cards under one of the feet to level it out but I didn't feel like that was something I wanted to do everytime I wanted to adjust the position of the stand."
3,Confusing on its own,"Nowhere on the cover, or in the first pages before the story, is this book listed as a sequel to Prince of Frogs, yet it reads like a sequel. You have the impression you were already supposed to know some back-story on these characters. Reading this one on its own, you feel a little bit like you've been thrown into the middle of it. I just came to Amazon and checked Prince of Frogs. It's clear from the synopsis that Prince of Frogs came first and should be read first.As another reviewer points out, the style is a little different, but I'm otherwise enjoying the book. I don't completely get these characters, but I like the plot and I definitely want to keep reading to find out what happens."
2,Annoying at best,"Boring plot, boring characters, pointless fighting between the two main characters that goes on and on and on. This book interested me a little in the beginning but eventually I found the two main characters, Kelsey and Finn, so darn annoying, I skimmed the remainder of the book away. At one point, Finn actually wishes that he and Kelsey (his girlfriend) someday get caught having sex by Kelsey's son. He's five - need I say more?"
5,Great book!,"While the examples are dated, true TRUTH never changes.The basic ideas Joe Gandolfo uses are the same today as they were when he wrote them. The book is currently out of print BUT what ever you pay for it when you find another will be well worth the ""investment"" of your money and the time you spend reading it."
3,Interesting? Maybe. Listenable? Well...,"I've had this one for a number of years. I know I'm supposed to like it, I certainly love Rocket from the Tombs that was recommended beside it when I looked it up today. This has never caught on with me. For atmospheric records from the 70s give me the early German stuff that this seems to reference. Try the first couple of Ash Ra Tempel albums, or even better Phallus Dei or Yeti by Amon Duul II. Even those however won't contain any recognizable ""tunes"" so be forewarned."
3,Outdated,This book is very outdated. The section on technology reads like from another planet. I would not recommend this book.
3,Good for Ms. McRae's fans,Purchased the CD because of the title track which is great; remember from years past. If you are a Carmen McRae fan...this is probably a good CD.
4,It's nice but get a new chain,It is a very nive little pendant that mom's just love. The only complaint is the the chain is very cheesy. When it first got it I had untangle the chain for 15 minutes. But if you get a decent chain it is very nice.
3,"Beautiful necklace, slow to deliver","We ordered it for Mother's Day and realized we ordered it a little late. Expecting it to arrived after Mother's Day was acceptable, but it didn't arrive for another week. That was longer than expected. However, it did make her smile and my son sure felt good giving it to her."
5,Great Value for the Price,"Great value. Sturdy, Solid pendant for any Mom. From a far looks like a very nice filigree heart pendant and only upon closer inspection do you make out the word ""Mom"". This was the perfect little gift for my wife after having our first baby."
4,Beautiful... chain a little short..,"THe charm is gorgeous... Any mother would love it from their husband or children. But okay if you are buying this necklace for a mother under the age of 30 they will be okay with the length of the chain, if you are buying the chain especially for a woman who is over the age of 40 they might be bothered by the short chain.. or if they have a large neck not saying my mother has a large neck she just has three surgery scars that the short rubbing chain bothers."
5,Gorgeous,"I was a bit hesitant when I ordered this necklace because I thought the pendant would be thin and bendable. However, when I received it, I was pleased to see the pendant was solid and gorgeous. My wife is a slender woman and the chain is longer than a choker, but does not hang down so far that she has to wear something low-cut for the pendant to be seen. Most important, my wife loved it."
3,"It's Fun, No more, No less","This is a crossover. That means that while it isn't a Technics turntable, it isn't a raging ghetto blaster either. I'm new to te whole mixing thing, and I find it straightforward and easy to use, so I recommend it to anyone who wants to pretend they're Pete Rock. However, it won't get you any where if you're serious about DJing. It isn't very loud, but you can plug it in to larger speakers. This Boombox is a good gift idea for a teenager that likes music. It's fun, and that's about it. My only real problem with it is that the right player skips, so we'll see if I can sort that out."
2,What the heck!,I got this DJ system for my son (13) for christmas and it worked for about one day and then there was no sound at all. Even turning all the volumes up did not help.And trust we read everything before even turnng it on.What a rip off!
4,Choir drama teacher likes,Have used for approx 7 1/2 yrs with HS and MS choirs and sound effects for dramas. Great tool for the price. It is wearing out but was worth the investment. Wish I could find a comparable replacement.
1,Don't do it,"I return it the next day. It didn't work, the sound was not clear at all. Save you money the sale is not a sale if the product don't work."
5,Soundtrack to redneck heaven,"Boy, does this ever bring back memories. What a glorious riot of lowbrow insanity these two immortal records are. Little Baby Buntin' in particular is pure redneck heaven - knuckle-draggin, Nascar-lovin', Colt .45 swillin' - the whole rooty toot. Or is Michael Gerald just having a good old chuckle with tongue in cheek all the while? Who knows. Without a doubt though these dudes occupied a musical space all of their very own, glorying in the truly bizzare. Perhaps only Butthole Surfers got close to Killdozer's obsession with the flotsam and jetsam of the great human soupbowl. The music is glorious throughout, grinding guitars and pounding drums behind Gerald's unique vocal delivery. Ah, the good ol' late 80s. Brings a tear to the eye, it does..."
3,"Not a great fit, but works","As others have said, it does not snap in well to the faceplates that I have like other Keystone inserts do. I was able to get most of them snapped in strongly, but leaves a small gap at the bottom. At least one is loose and I fear plugging/unplugging may snap it out, requiring that I take the plate off to re-set it.The wire connectors, though easy to use, are not very strong. Wires pull out fairly easily, requiring that I had to take the outlet back off after securing to wall... make sure to check both before and after you fasten the outlet in place!However, the product does work for the simple job of converting 3.5mm IR receiver to the three signal lines going to the IR hub."
2,Does not fit standard keystone,"There were three reviews when I ordered this - two praising it, and one stating that it did not fit the keystone. Foolishly I ignored the warning.I tried to fit these into two Leviton Decora keystone wall plates - one with two spaces and one with three. In both cases, the keystone fits a tiny bit back in the plate and also leaves a narrow gap beneath it. The resulting appearance is not good enough. I will return these and get the genuine Leviton ones."
5,Their Last GREAT release,"Between 'Hairway to Steven' and 'Pioughd' there's a huge gap, with only this EP. I remember the drought of Buttholes material at the end of the 80's and how myself and all my Buttholes-crazed friends just gobbled this up when it was released in '89.Each song is great (even though 'Helicopter' drags a bit).For those who say this is 'transitional' to Pioughd I say rubbish. For starters this is good - Pioughd STINKS!!!'Bong Song' sounds like something off 'Rembrandt Pussyhorse', 'Colored FBI Guy' could be off 'Hairway to Steven' and 'Booze, Cars, Pussy...' is one of those inspired pieces of madness (check out the drum machine 'solo') that will make me love the Buttholes always.If you see it, grab it. better still order it from Amazon... :)"
5,this is an exciting and beautiful book,absolute gem!!! wordless story told in pictures and original musical score- everyone should enjoy this book
5,SIX worthy songs! (not a bad haul),"I'm mostly a song person. I love Jesus Lizard and I have my own personal cd comp of all their songs I love.From this album I love tracks 1,2, 4, 5 (-oh god #5!!), 6, and 8 -a rather good harvest of songs, I think."
5,This band Rocks,"This is a completely underated band that deserves a lot more recognition....this whole album ROCKS! Buy it, you won't regret it!"
3,"stop singing out of your @ss, David","I was a huge Scratch Acid fan before Jesus Lizard emerged, and for me half of the excitement of a S.A. record (at least) was David Yow's incredible, visceral, demon-possessed ranting, screaming, and yowling (YOWling?). Musically, I liked J.Lizard, but Yow always sounded terribly muffled and undermixed on the records. Also, J. Lizard never reached the heights of musical anarchy that Scratch Acid did, but then no one else has come as close. J. Lizard were still amazing live -- best show I ever saw, except for Nomeansno!"
2,oh boy(grumble...),"loved scratch acid(previous efforts).this was mediocre,i am sorry to say.spend your money on ""the greatest gift""(scratch acid)instead.trust me.really."
4,look carefully at the album cover,"this is one of those albums that when someone is looking through your cd collection, they will either say: ""f**k yeah! the jesus lizard!"", or ""who the f**k are the jesus lizard?"" - upon which you will sit them down and play them this cd. it is at this point that arms will spring out of the stereo, grab the unsuspecting listeners head, rip their brains out, and f**king smash them! this my friends is what i like to call music (a term thrown around all too much these days) so do yourself a favour and buy this cd and spread the disgusting love that is the jesus lizard.also, steve albini produced this record, and chances are that if you like this, you will like steve albini's bands - big black, rapeman, shellac. however, be warned these albums are likely to cause brain explosions also."
5,Saddle the Wind x 2,"This is amazing FSM pressing, limited to 3000 copies with a 20-page-booklet.What make it amazing? This CD contains the complete official usued Score by Elmer Bernstein, with 12 Track and Total Time 31:15Also there is by Track 13 - Track 26 the unused score by Jeff Alexander with total time 35:32Total Disc time: 66:53And just the the title song ""Saddle the Wind"" is a beautiful one.don't miss it - buy it!!!"
4,"An eclectic, compelling mix, for the most part...","The title track alone, with its anthem-like quality and stellar contributions from Earth, Wind & Fire members, makes this disc worth owning. ""Love Song"" is another highlight for those who enjoy Love Unlimited Orchestra-style string arrangements. ""Gemini Rising"" should appeal to those who appreciate Chick Corea & Return To Forever's more experimental '70s work. In just seven tracks, the CD encompasses a broad mix of immediately accessible and less accessible styles."
4,the man on keys,"the title cut was recorded with my favorite group of all-time earth,wind&fire.the brillant and under-rated maurice white and mr. lewis get down on this one.the rest of the album is tight.mr. lewis is bad on the keys just as he is still today."
5,Classic!!!,What more can be said about this recording. I wish I was present in the recording process.
4,Very Good But A Tad Samey,"""Sun Godess"" and ""Hot Doggit"" more or less sell this album-both feature Earth,Wind & Fire.But I would reccomend the sameyears ""Don't It Feel Good"" over this (if you can find it) becausethis album doesn't hold up as whole quite as well.But nothing onhere is terrible and the title track alone is at LEAST two outof the stars here!Completly jazz-funky but a bit predictable too."
4,"Real Music.., Real Craft.., True expession","At some point I have to reference back to musicians like Ramsey Lewis,Ronnie Laws, Gil Scott,etc... The jazz sounds of the mid-seventies to the mid-eighties were really the best of "" pure "" musical legend.., No music today, except for a few like the George Howard's, Paul Hardcastle's, Sade' whom put their thing down in the nineties, survive time testing.. Now when neo-soul can go ""The Best of"" I'll give it a shot..."
3,works as good as the Clarins neck cream,I had brought and returned a similar Clarins product at about twice the price. I don't expect magic but I'd like to see a little improvement and feel good about myself. Feels great on the neck and decollete.
2,Let me explain,"I found this book to have mostly ""feel good"" language ie ""I'm special and my daddy loves me"" rather than a good,clear explanation of what donor insemination is. It also had a couple of real clankers in it - the worst one was ""here's me in my Mommys tummy"" Mommy's tummy?? This is biologically incorrect information that parents tell their children because they are too embarrassed to use the word ""uterus"". I will actually white this out in the book before I read it to my child. It might serve as a general reinforcement to your child that it's ok to be a product of donor insemination, but don't expect valuable information from this book."
3,"A Good Tool, but lots of Errors","Although this book was very helpful as a supplement to my college engineering physics course, Browne makes several mathematical errors in his practice problems. I recommend buying the book because it's a huge help in understanding calculus based physics, but be on the lookout for the errors in the answers. There are usually at least 2-3 per chapter."
2,Not a nuclear physicist!,"I'm just an engineering student, so what do I know? Well, I will tell you this much: there are a lot of errors in this book. Someone else wrote a review that said these errors are a good way to learn. This person was also a practicing physicist! I'm still learning and I don't leave much room for interpretation when something is incorrect. I automatically assume I'm wrong because I'm still learning. This is overkill, but there are a LOT of errors so don't throw caution to the wind. This book also explicitly states that you should understand some ""obvious"" things. If I did, I'd stick with my textbook! Not completely useless, but can be frustrating."
1,Unreliable-Too many errors,"As other people have stated, this book has many errors in every chapter. Not just with the solutions to problems but also in some of the equations and ideas. How can you learn from a book when you can't trust what the author is saying?"
1,Please proof read before marketing to the public,"The book was engaging in the fact that in presented challenging problems and helped the reader work through them but by chapter 10 I just couldn't take all the errors and had to put it down. There are numerous misprints for example problem 5.8 They set the problem up correctly but then clearly wrote the wrong answer (56,000 x 0.05 is not 2300). They misprint the number 34 with a 134 in problem 5.12 but then solve correctly, 5.17 they subtract m2g from m2a incorrectly but the next line reverse it. problem 5.19 when taking the derivitive of a sin they write the answer as sin, but the next line change it to cos. This is all very confusing if you are just learning the material, and the mistakes are everywhere. It becomes very time consuming to check and recheck answers just to find the book was wrong. This is the first schaum's outline I bought and will not buy another."
1,Unwrapped mattress,"Cradle Mattresses - Size 18x36This mattress comes bare-no plastic covering at all. I have no way of telling if this mattress was previously purchased, then returned, then sent to me. When I opened the shipping box, there was a bare mattress, no ""sanitary"" type of covering, no label on the mattress. Whether it is a good quality mattress doesn't matter since I would never use this mattress. Very disappointed."
3,Cradle Matress 18x36,"The matress is fine. It was delivered in a box without a cover/plastic sleeve on it. This doesn't seem very sanitary to me and was off putting. I will clean it with lysol before using it. At first I thought it was used, but after inspecting it, I believe it is new."
5,Sweet Dreams,The cradle mattress fit my little wooden cradle perfectly! It sits on springs and provides padded comfort. Very happy with the item and shipping of it.
3,Cradle Mattress 18x36x2,"The mattress was folded in a box which I didn't like but the mattress was just as advertised. I was hoping it would have been a bit firmer foam but you could squess it almost flat between your thumb and index finger. But it is only for the first 3 to 4 months and the baby won't be very big by that time, so I think it is fine. Received mattress within 2 days of shipping. Shipped 2 days after order."
5,Cradle Mattress,"Fits the cradle my father-in-law made nearly 30 years ago for our kids perfectly--now we're using it for our first grandchild when she visits. I didn't remember what I'd done with the old mattress and thought I'd have to come up with some foam substitute and decided to check online first. The measurements didn't seem quite right when I ordered it, but I read other reviews of it fitting old cradles so thought I'd take a chance."
1,Fictitious fiction,"Sorry, but this books rings so hollow that its a fiction to call it fiction. It's nothing but a bunch of words strung together.Truly terrible and ugly prose."
3,Blackjack: Take the Money and Run,"I wanted to add this book to my library of Blackjack books. It verifies some of the strategies I'm using to create my own system to win at the game. It is a ""work in progress"" at www.blackjack-bailout.com"
1,Written by a Casino,Don't buy this book it was written by a casino!! 100% sure. Waste of money and the basic strategy is wrong in this book
5,"Really enjoyed this story,",I really enjoy time travel romances and this book was just perfect in every way. I loved the characters and didn't see what was coming at the end. Fabulous book from start to finish. Awesome plot and just an all round lovely story. Thank you to the author for a wonderful read.
2,Unlikeable herione,"The book was a bit tedious, because of the selfish attributes of the main character. She was much too interested in how she looked and keeping her lies straight, to be someone you could relate to. I gave it two stars, because of the ending."
1,Awful,"Sounded interesting but unfortunately turned out to be lacking in depth (very few characters with one track minds; medieval world reduced to interiors/exteriors reminiscent of a low budget film)and an ending so abrupt and superficial as to be irritating. Reads like a teenage fantasy of the ""knight in shining armour"" genre and, as such, lacks psychological/historical richness."
3,Good until the twist at the end.,Enjoyed most of the story until the end. Judy is in love with Andrew but leaves him. It works out in the end. But it would of been better if they were not separated so for long.
2,"THE ""L"" WORD FINAL SEASON",WELL I loved the show.. but the Final Season .. STUNK! It was like a bunch of Girls . .whom didnt know anything.... the Writter should of ended with something more creative!
1,A bad show got even worse,"This show was never good, but this last season was pathetic. The dance contest episode was the most boring television I have ever watched."
1,unsatisfactory,"I recently order the l word final season. It was a complete disappointment. The only disc that worked was the last disc. It skipped throughout and I couldnt even go to scene selection without it stopping and going back to the beginning. I understand selling things used but they could at least made sure it played. It didnt play at all and there was deep scratches all over the disc. However, i will say that they responded to my issue promptly and gave me my refund without a problem."
1,Horrible ending to a great series,"I loved The L Word series, although it obviously started going downhill in season four and continued a downward slide through season five. But season six is just horrible. Characters act totally unlike they have in the previous five seasons, and the whole mystery about who killed Jenny (if anyone did) was so boring. Who cares who killed Jenny? The character has been completely unlikeable for years; honestly, I'm surprised that she wasn't done in long before this.And for being the last season, there is no closure. The last show in the season is especially weak. And the whole big mystery around Jenny's death is never solved, either, in case anyone actually cares. What a horrible way to end a good show; The L Word, and its fans, deserved better than what was delivered."
3,"The L Word, Last season","Even though this show was all Hollywood gay scene, it did hit on some very important issues concerning society. This Last season was a huge let down because crucial questions weren't really answered."
5,L Word : Last Season,"I was anticipating the DVD when it came before I knew it. The ending was appropriate but I was sad to see the series end. Maybe a reunion or a delayed continuation? One can wish, right? I hoped that the sixth season was longer but I guess the writers and actors were tired of the storyline. Overall, the series was enjoyable and very stimulating!"
1,Did you actually plan this ending?,I will buy it eventually to end out my collection of the series. I am really glad that I didn't preorder. That would have been a waste of funds. You leave everything at a question mark. Not a cliffhanger ending a smart aleck teenage way. Enough Said.
4,"The exact opposite of ""Queer as Folks""","Realize a few things:1) Although there are scenes of women making out and breasts are shown, the show is not pornographic. There is a larger emphasis on the relationships between the characters.2) Every character is a lesbian, but it's not the same type of lesbianism that you see in pornography. If you don't know the difference, then I would advise against purchasing, since you'll be disappointed."
5,Love the L Word,"I'm in denial that this is the last season of The L Word, since I had grown accustom to most of the characters. Some old characters that lost my respect came back in this season and kinda redeemed themselves for me."
1,Do not trust this seller,"I ordered a season of a show for a christmas gift for my mom. I ordered it in mid November and did not receive it by christmas... in fact, i did not receive it al all."
1,L Word Season 6 WTF,"I think tee shirts are in order here that simply say L Word 6 WTF ?I own the other 5 seasons and I'll probably purchase season 6 only to complete the set (can we say OCD......) but I'm not too happy about it. What a waste of film and time. Maybe this was the plan all along; to have us endlessly write about how crappy the ending was ?? Too bad really, the show, characters and the fans deserved better."
1,"Horrible, waste of money to keep Showtime for this show","I loved the first three seasons of The L Word, and it all went downhill after that. The last season was a complete joke, 8 episodes?! Are you kidding me? I don't pay extra money to have Showtime for a lousy 8 episodes, and bad ones at that. There are no questions answered in the season finale at all, what was the reason the writers had for killing off Jenny? This season was the worst season of any tv show I have ever watched and I regret keeping Showtime to watch the final season, it was a waste of time and money on my part."
3,Uneven and unsatisfying,"This season lacks one very important thing: closure. There were a lot of story lines floating around from seasons 4 and 5, but few of them get resolved. One notable exception is Bette and Tina. Thank God those two finally figured things out.But Helena loses her fire; Shane ties herself down in a horrid relationship; and Jenny... if possible, she acts even crazier than before. So in general, characters act very uncharacteristically throughout this season.That's not to say I didn't enjoy it, but the finale in particular left me feeling very unsatisfied. It's bad form to present a huge mystery and then not answer it. Personally, I think Sounder did it. Man's best friend? I think not."
4,Fragile Beauty : The Victorian Art of Pressed Flowers,"Practical design techniques, list of flowers that press well, cultivating a pressing garden and a wealth of other information. This book would be useful for a beginner or advanced pressed flower designer; and a treasure for anyone who loves Victoriana. 90 pages hardcover"
4,"Be careful of the highlights, you might get dizzy","I once read that Steve Albini said when he first heard the vocals from this record he was embarassed for Brian McMahan, but after listening a couple of times, he was moved to tears.I also heard the comment that when this album came out, it was as if an entirely new type of music had been created. I couldn't agree more. This was a moment of vital new direction, and the highlights on the album are dizzying. For me, ""Good Morning, Captain"" is as beatiful and intense and frightening as any song I know."
4,spiders at night,"the familiar mercury taste of cigarette smoke fills my stomach. cold sweat breaks. i dread listening to SPIDERLAND because it thickens the dread in my stomach. cold sweat breaks.remember spiders at night are good luck.(fans should also check out the wu tang clan's debut, to live and shave in l.a., kevin drumm, mars, the double leopards, keiji haino, mikami kan, dizzee rascal, the charalambides, and creation rebel.)"
3,Download this record,"-long jams with spoken word-""good morning captain"" is one of my all-time favorite songs-doesn't sound better on vinyl (cd jacket says otherwise)"
5,...,"Too many people here seem to have missed the first and only important fact about spiderland--that it is astonishingly beautiful. Forget words like ""seminal"" and ""revolutionary,"" for they are only verbal playthings which obscure the fact that when the bomb drops, most of us will be listening to this album. This is the new classic--Mahler doesn't make me cry anymore, ""washer"" does. bombastic? of course. true and neccessary? right."
3,Okay,"Alright, enough about this ""godhead""stuff. I mean, it's okay and all... I like Bastro, Sonic Youth, Rapeman, Drive Like Jehu, Mahavishnu Orchestra, etc... I mean, it's just indie prog. A good record, but... to hear what this could have been, but isn't, listen to the superior version: Voivod's Nothingface (1989). Now that's what I'm talking about!"
3,Slint - Spiderland,"I remember borrowing this cd from my library like five years ago, I really liked it at the time, it has the sort of raw sound that I really liked then. It is still a good cd, but it is not for everyone, even for myself, I don't like it as much as I once did but I can remember why I did."
2,Weavings wanting,2 1/2Overly cited indiecency that barely maintains any lasting intrigue past an important lead-off track.
1,a great album...,"if your idea of fun is an album of long, monotonous songs that all start with meandering strummed guitar that slowly (and I mean slowly)builds up to bludgeoning power chords only to die back down to irritating strumming again. And if you like a vocalist who alternately speaks and whispers in an off-key voice. This record is only about forty minutes long and it feels like two hours! This record is a summation of everything that is self-indulgent and boring about indie rock! The definitive statement! (The back of the CD case bears the warning that ""This recording is meant to be listened to on vinyl."" Hey, guys, lighten up!)"
5,Amazing..,I was turned onto this album only a few years ago and after listening to it a few times realized that it was THE missing link album of the '90s sound. It made other musics make sense and at the same time sucked me back to the confusing and lost times of my life as a late teen. There are parts of these songs the evoke a very simular feeling as a Bruckner Symphony...and if you know Bruckner you know how powerful that is. It's raw emotion and very carfuly calculated songs. If you have any brain waves and appreciate many types of music..I assure you this will climb to the very tops of your personal charts. BUY IT!
4,Fantastic Book,This book is a fantastic introduction to the fundamentals of geotechnical engineering. I recommend it to everyone
4,Perfect fit,"The hood protector is a perfect fit for my 1998 Chevrolet Malibu, however I didn't like how it looked on my car. Still kept it though, so it must not have been that bad."
3,A little known author,"Elizabeth Musser writes an excellent story with a Christian theme that is not preachy. This book is second in a series of three. The only problem is that having become wrapped up in the history of Algeria's fight for independence, the third book is unavailable unless you can read French! Look for other books she has written. She grew up in Atlanta, so some of her books will bring back mental pictures of life in that environment."
4,Benson Live,"Weekend In L.A. is a smooth live recording by George Benson. His version of ""On Broadway"" is a great combination of jazz, r&b with a dash of funk thrown in. Mr. Benson's voice has never sounded finer and the song became a top ten single. There are other great performances on the album including the smoky ""Lady Blue"", the breezy title cut, the heavy jazz of ""Ode To A Kudu"" and a touching tribute to his mentor Wes Montgomery, ""We Remember Wes"". There is also Mr. Benson's original version of ""The Greatest Love Of All"" which is from the Muhammad Ali biopic, The Greatest. The song is nothing like the overplayed, schmaltzy version that Whitney Houston had a hit with. It is an understated, pretty song that Mr. Benson doesn't go over the top with."
4,Benson Live...in the middle of his pop crossover,"This is a great cd which is a blend of his masterful guitar and emerging singing career. This was Benson's phenom band...Ralph McDonald, Phil Upchurch, Jorge Dalto,and the extraordinaire Harvey Mason This is the cd that you will hear his mastery of the guitar and bits of his vocalizing. Other live cds seem to concentrate on the vocals. This is the next best thing to being there. I was lucky enough to see this concert at the Roxy in los angeles, CA. His opening act was Gil Scott Heron...check out Gil Scott Heron's cd 1980 on Amazon..great cd. This is one of the first recorded concerts by Benson when he switched from his Gibson to the Ibanez guitar...still had that deep sound.Pop this in your cd player and drive....you'll not regret it. NOW lets hear the Remastered cd!!!!"
4,cooking benson,"Probably my favourite George Benson album, and I have a few. This is one that I keep coming back to, one that I like to play first thing in the morning to get me moving. Also my favourite cover of ""Greatest Love of All"". When I first heard this I played it do death learning the words. Now all I need is a remaster. My copy is a very poor imitation of what it ought to sound like."
3,Not what I expected,"George Benson - Live in L.A.This is an older CD of a live performance. Be sure you check out the snipets to be sure you like it. I'd have to characterize this CD as a Collector's piece for unwavering George Benson fans. For casual Benson fans you may be better off with a Greatest Hits CD etc.. The extended compositions were distorted, perhaps to suit the California audience and time of recording. Think Jazz fusion-funk inspired rants.. Not the smooth melodic sounds typical of G. Benson.George Benson collectors - have at it. Others use caution."
5,Incredible timesaver,"What a timesaver! I use this with a Jet 1100 CFM dust collector. It works flawlessly, installed in about 2 minutes and saves me a bundle of time from walking back and forth to the dust collector. The RF signal works through walls, so I can now put the collector in a small room adjacent to my shop and free up additional space. There's even a belt clip on the unit, allowing me to clip it on while I'm in the shop. Well worth it."
4,Sleek & neatly portable,"Really like this lil' gem. It's easy to tote it in my backpack along w/all of other mobile video-conferencing gear. The image quality of the video is pretty sweet and has lived up to its billing. As well, it hangs on my laptop perfectly and is quickly and easily adjustable. I'm really happy w/this purchase and the price on Amazon was the best I found."
3,Excellence in engineering.....not,"This web cam gets mixed reviews. The Good.. I really like the camera...it is great in low light situation. I use it alot in hotel rooms when I travel to talk and see my family members back home. The case is a great idea and can bounce around in my laptop bag and I don't have to worry about it. The Bad...What were the engineers at Logitech thinking when they came up with the arms/legs. As Red and Green says get the duct tape out. The other reviewer who says this is a delicate insturment and should be treated as such....I think is the engineer program manager from Logitech trying to defend a very lame design. Let see, is it form follows function or function follows form."
4,4.5 Stars Great little gadet!,"This is my first webcam. I am very pleased. Easy installation, great picture quality and microphone pick up! I travel a lot and I love that this comes with a carrying case too! It works great with Yahoo Instant Messenger, haven't tried it yet with AIM. No glitches soo far. (...) I placed the order on 1/25/04 and received on 1/27/04!"
1,This is not the real camera that everybody will like,"I bought this camera, yes, it works out of box. But the quality is so terrible that it even can have clear picture on any one of computer. I am going to call Amazon to exchange for this item. Hopefully I can try another one and get clear picture. I cannot believe such kind of quality product will can suvive in USA???"
4,good thing,"Nice design, easy to 'fold' and travel with in supplied hard case. Easy installation, functions well, good picture quality however online still gives frame by frame. Overall, great purchase for price payed."
2,Don't underestimate form factor,"It is a great camera, if optics are the only measure of greatness. But that would be like saying that the engine is the only measure of a good car. If the steering wheel is on the wrong side of the dashboard, that's not just some aesthetic issue.So it is with this camera. The stand is terrible. Not only is it flimsy, it's basically inflexible. The camera can sit in one position, with no possiblity to raise, lower, or turn the lens. It wouldn't take much more in terms of design or manufacturing, to be able to set it up with some flexibility. And it can't sit on a table, etc, because the cord extends from the bottom of the unit rather than the top. Inexplicable.A camera is as useful as you can make it. If you would buy a 35mm film camera that could only take mid-distance portraits, and nothing else, then this is the quickcam for you. Again, the image quality is excellent, but that matters far less if there's only one type of image it can capture."
5,Outstanding imaging performance.,"Yeah, the stand is lousy and I almost passed on this camera at first becuase of it. In daily use the stand is just adequate but I'll live with it to get the level of image quality this camera provides. I'm usually disappointed by the video from most webcams, but this one delivers excellent video under extremely diverse and difficult lighting conditions - a must for mobile users. Do you're self a favor and spend the few extra bucks for this one if you're a true road warrior."
2,"Exceptional for limited use, then kaput","Used on a Pentium M laptop w/ vCon H.263/264 video conferencing software; never used LogiTech software. Flawlessly connected to high-end Polycom & Tandberg units, & sent impressive video quality. Clip on laptop mount is durable and effective, extremely portable. Image is quite sharp once mushy focus is set. I use headset so no idea how camera microphone sounds. Effective face tracking. HOWEVER, after ~20 sessions something failed, camera produced only vertical streaks. LogiTech replaced it free."
2,Good but not perfect.,"Given that this webcam is near the high end of webcam prices, I expected a much better picture quality. The video quality is good, but the stills aren't that clear. It hangs pretty well on my laptop. Lastly, it saves video files as AVIs, but they are pretty big: A two second clip (320 x 240) with sound was 1MB. Still debating if I should return it or not."
2,"flimsy stand, substandard image quality","i've been using the quickcam 3000 for a few years now with good results. so i figured i wasn't taking any risks to buy the quickcam pro for notebooks. i use it on a thinkpad t41 with windows xp sp1 and the latest logitech drivers. the image quality is grainy. definitely worse than my old quickcam 3000. if i could i'd return this and look around for a cam with better image quality. i tried everything in the faqs from logitech with no improvements.also, the clip-on attachment doesn't really clip...it just hangs on your lcd....the whole attachment system is very flimsy.i'm unsatisfied. look elsewhere or wait until these issues are resolved."
3,Weak support...,"This camera is wonderfully light and small, yet still has great visual capabilities. The only problem that I am experiencing is the supports used to mount it on the lap top are weak and seldom keep the camera stable/steady...which causes much confusion on the viewers end and frustration on my end of things!"
4,A good purchase,"I moved from England to America and wanted to keep in contact with my family. The Logitech QuickCam has been great. It is really easy to set up, and the quality is not bad. I love the carry case, and the whole thing is small enough to travel around with me. Definitely a good purchase and at a competative price."
5,great porduct,"Bought this after much research and looking at reviews on this board. Everything installed easy, no hang-ups and works great with microsft IM. The quality is great - even with just the glow of your monitor.Some people have mentioned difficulty with getting it to attach on the screen - it's not a problem. I think those people didn't look at the directions (and image) of how to attach it. You don't rest it directly on top - it actually sits back off the screen about an inch while the two legs latch over the top of the monitor...."
1,Flawed Design,I don't know who this would work for but I think the design is terrible. It does not stay put no matter how tightly you wear it and there is not enough velcro to adjust it properly. Not to mention that it is impossible to put this on yourself so forget having to remove it to go to the bathroom or anything else. It is not supportive at all and if you are able to get it on low enough it definitely shows through your clothes.
1,What support?,"I am at the end of my pregnancy and thought this would alleviate some of my back stress at work (As an RN). I ordered according to the recommended size chart but when I had it come it was HUGE!!!! I am not a small woman but if that was an XL, I must normally be a size 1. Yeah right. I double checked the sizes and had ordered correctly according to their charts. Anyway, the thing was useless, it took forever to arrive so I couldn't reorder in a timely manner, and it looks adjustable, but good luck with that. I would definitely recommend NOT buying this product on-line."
1,HUGE,"I can't believe how huge this belt is. I ordered it according to their recommended size, but it looks like it would fit an elephant and when I tighten it to fit, the material is all bunched up. Even if it wasn't so large around my waist I would not find this belt comfortable, it has a really big band that goes half way up my back and digs into my legs, so it is impossible to sit down in. I only wear it at home if I am going to be standing for a while, but it comes off the second I sit down. So unfortunately I can't wear this support when I go out, it is very difficult to put on and would be to much of a hassle, plus you have to take it off to use the restroom. I wish I had not purchased this product."
5,Mom-Ez Maternity Back Support,It was great. It really help support and took pressure off my lower back.
4,awesome!,"This is an awesome product. I'm carrying twins, so the load is unbelievable - my twins are at least 2 pounds each, not counting the placentas and amniotic fluid of each. I'm quite small (5' 2""), and it was such a relief to put this on. I felt like I was being gently hugged and my back no longer hurt. So why did I give it only 4 stars? Because the velcro near the front would rub against the sensitive skin of both my thighs, right at the crease. It hurt, but I just put a pair of my husband's socks to cushion it. It's heaven sent, so I don't really mind the socks. It adds to the cushioning in front, around the belly. I highly recommend this! Definitely worth it!"
4,very helpful and mostly comfortable,"I purchased this belt after looking at several on line and reading reviews. I also emailed the seller to find the exact dimensions of the product.The large is 65 inches long. The widest part of the belt, which rests on the back, is 8 inches and the narrowest part is 4 inches, which is near the ends.The XL is approximately 72 inches long. The width is the same as the large.The belt is as advertised, soft and has stays in the back to support, it does have to be readjusted sometimes when changing positions from standing or sitting or getting in and out of the car, but overall, very helpful in taking strain off my lower back. I would recommend this to anyone with lower back pain."
4,Very helpful during pregnancy,"I used this belt for four pregnancies after first trying a cheap maternity belt that was about 3-inches wide. I don't think there is a perfect belt that will stay in exactly the right place when you have a huge protruding belly and lead an active life with continually sitting/standing/walking. But this belt really does help relieve a lot of the discomforts that can occur - especially during the time mom's hormones kick in gear to allow for the pelvis to expand. As with any belt made with velcro, you will have to make sure that the velcro is completely covered or it can be scratchy against the skin. I am sure this belt saved me many days/hours of pain. Let's face it, the last trimester is uncomfortable and there's really not anything that will take that away. This belt will at least help. I even slept with it on!"
2,"Nice title, dumb story","Wendy and Elliot get away from their parents. While looking for help, they come to a place called Camp Jellyjam. It's a camp devoted to sports. Competitive Elliot loves it there, but Wendy can't help feel like something is wrong. Why are the competitions so serious? What's with the ""Only the best"" motto? Why doesn't the leader seem very interested in finding their parents?This title was not impressive. The plot was nothing short of ridiculous, which is a pity since the beginning was captivating; 2 lost siblings, a creepy camp... Sure the mascot was a clue, but...Meh."
3,Not one of the best ...,"I know that these books are geared at a younger audience, but this one must be geared at 4 year olds. The ""monster"" in the book is a gigantic purple blob that sweats snails. Not scary and defintly not even close to being realistic. One more thing, the kids get to the camp by wrecking in the back of a camper trailer. The parents find the trailer, but don't care to look 25 feet away at a sports camp for their kids. No. They call the camp. That makes no sense at all. This was poorly written, but I gave it three stars anyway because I like sports and everything but the ""hidden"" aspects of the book were good. Not the best Goosebump out there. I own, merely because I have the collection."
4,One of the best Goosebumps books.,I think that the best part is when Wendy goes down the stairs in the igloo- shaped place and sees King Jelejam. The part I didn't like was when Wendy and her family were in the car on a long journey at the start of the book.It is one of the best Goosebumps books and Irecommend it to anyone.
4,horror at a camp of competion,The Horror at Camp Jellyjam was exiting and scary. They gotseparated from their parents and found by a camp counslerbuddy. Who told them about camp and to wait for thereparents. The parents were looking for them at camp. The camp said the kids weren't there. They had to compete. They had to collect coins but once they collected them they disappared afterthe winners walk. I dont want to give away the ending.
4,good,the book was good and the quality was good. i haven't had any problems with any of the items i have purchased.
3,Not the best!,"This book was O.K. but there was barely anything scary in it and it took so long for anything to really happen. R.L.Stine wrote a lot of great books, but this was just not one of them."
4,Excellent value,"I purchased this GPS when I began to geocache. The Garmin Summit is an excellent value for the money. It has all the features a geocacher needs, including the ability to download waypoints from geocaching websites. The unit was in ""like new"" condition when it arrived and it performed just as well as my friend's new Garmin GPS. Be sure to buy the computer cable for downloads. Other units include a cable, so I was disappointed when the Summit didn't. It is a significant extra cost, but you will appreciate the convenience."
2,This is Not The Greatest Karaoke-But For Beginners it's fine,This could be better. You can find much better at a local karaoke store
1,Really didn't meet my needs.,"I had to purchase this since I thought that the quality would surpass my expectation. I was to record a conference and translate it to english for a formal presentation to the board. Not only was the quality horrible, but it was un understandable. I find this product to be a big waste of money. I'm sure theirs something out there that can do better. Sorry Olympus, I've had your product in the past and was VERY satisfied, but this one really let me down when I really needed it.I'd give it a no star, but the head set was actually the only good part of the unit."
2,Not for lectures,"I received the recorder expecting it to be as good as the mircocassette recorders that Olympus manufactures. This was not the case for a classroom or lecture recording. The hissing sound couched my voice completely even in a very quiet 10 foot room. It may be fine for a scope of 3-6 inches but, other than that, I would not recommend it. I called Olympus directly and found that they made NO digital voice recorders for large (6-10 feet) conference rooms or lecture halls--yet.I would like to say that they were very honest and tried their best to help me out. I am just going to update the older model of the Pearlcorder S720 to an S725 or S950 microcassette model.Again, I would not recommend it for voice recording over a 3-6 inch range even with an external mike--too much internal noise from the recorder itself."
4,What I wanted,"I needed a really small device for taking notes, making recordings of meetings and listening to my spanish course in while biking.This device does that well. It turned out that it is very good for listening to music with too.I have many other USB devices (I recommend the Linksys hub!), and after installation of a CD-RW on my laptop, I had to go to the Device Manager to click on remove and then restore to get the Olympus working again./JB"
4,MP3 Playback Compatibility For Mac OS Fix,"I would have given it five stars but they dissed Apple by not providing MP3 compatibility. There is an MP3 driver that get's installed by the PC only, Music Match.I've done a lot of searching for freeware to come up with a fix for this. You can use Kilometre. I have a packet with directions for download but the review guidelines prevent me from posting a url for downloading. If you know of a really popular posting forum where I could put this, let me know. Thanks"
1,Not good as a primary dictation device.,I got one of these at work to be used primarily as a dictation device. It is almost unusable. There is no cue forward/reverse during record. You can only pause/restart. Can't edit your files. Can't insert in middle of file. Voice quality is great though.
3,No MAC support,Pretty cool if you have a pc. However if you have a Macintosh there is absolutely no way to listen to music on this thing. The only software (musicmatch) you can use to transfer music to the device never supported the DM-1 for Macintosh and now they have discontinued even making musicmatch for Macintosh. One would think you could just transfer the mp3's over using a smartmedia card drive but then one would be wrong. There is no way to transfer music without the musicmatch sounds dangerous to me. What if Musicmatch goes out of business? Then were out of luck for the PC's too and you've got [an expensive] voice recorder.
1,Waste of money,"We bought this because we thought it would be more hygienic and better than those big plastic scoops - we were wrong. Small clumps fall through the grates in the scoop. The scoop itself is rather flat, so when you jiggle what you pick up to have the unused sand grains drop off, the cat waste also falls off."
3,Tape and no screw holes ... Mmmm,"I kind of walked into this thought as I bought it and I was right. The tape sucks. I drilled two holes through it and then its a good product. Once the holes are in there and its screwed to the wall it really works great. The wood finish is acceptable in my opinion and now I'm happy with it. So, three stars. If they ever get around to predrilling them for me, as it can get tricky because one has to drill straight down at the edge, its five stars."
3,Buy extra holding tape,I placed the holder in my traveler trailer during the summer and I went back out to the trailer 1 week later and the product was on the floor. The item arrived with the adhesive peeled off.
2,Rehash of Moon Handbooks Pacific Mexico,If you want to know about more than just the Puerto Vallarta area buy the Pacific Mexico Handbook. Better than 80% of the content of the Puerto Vallart Handbook is included as well as information of the other Pacific destinations. If you do not plan to venture more than 25 - 50 miles from Puerto Vallarta this book adds no additional value.
1,Worthless upon worthless,"Absolutly positively the worst travel guide I have ever read!!! Don't waste your money. The only thing that surpases what it doesn't include, is what it does include. Hardly anything of value! This book is a waste of a perfectly good tree."
2,Goodman trying too hard,"After the first few chapters, I found myself thinking that A Season to be Sinful was a deep, powerfully written novel. But, I realized shortly after that that I was wrong. Goodman's writing gets old very quickly. Nothing is clearly written or revealed. She tries too hard to be esoteric. She frustrates the reader by giving little mysterious tidbits and then not explaining herself until several chapters later. That's a fine gimick if utilized one or two times, but every single chapter has incomprehensible information. That's just annoying after awhile. In the end, the story gets dragged out in such a long, convoluted manner, that you just want to give up halfway through. I usually like Goodman's books, but this one just took too much effort. Plot that moves along nicely is a key element that she has forgotten in her desire to be ""taken seriously"" as a writer."
4,Indulge & Enjoy !!!,"This tale of Lily, and Viscount Sheridan (Sherry to those close at hand)..is well written and an enjoyable read..altho I must say a bit long...but with a good ending.....The additional antics of the three lads,..Pinch, Dash, and Midge...really made it even more enjoyable. Go ahead and read this one..."
2,Not for me,"I guess the bobby show is not for everyone. I tried for a few days and it made it easier to slur notes regardless of the register. Although, I bought this last year and have not tried it since. I've only played on it a total of like 3 times for less than 30 min. so I guess it takes more time to break in."
2,It's not you it's me...,"First, I'd like to state that there was absolutely nothing physically wrong with this product. It was exactly what it was advertised to be. However, I'm giving it a bad review anyway because it simply didn't work for me. The cup was too shallow for my lip structure which would block the opening if I tried to play anything near the top of the staff. I also didn't like the sound quality of what I was able to play in the lower register. My advice to anyone looking to buy a mouthpiece online is to try that model out in person before making a purchase."
1,It's the wrong damn mouthpiece and it's all scratched up,"The mouthpiece that I received is a Yamaha 11B NOT a Bobby Shew Lead. No Way - Not even close. The cup and rim are OK, but the exterior has several deep scratches - through the silver and down into the brass. I appears that it was hit with a fixed blade knife or some similar tool. It plays and I only paid $20 for it and that makes it cheaper to keep it in my book ;especially when you factor in all of the hassle of mailing it back.I suspect that the person that sold this items was expecting that sort of reaction from the rube that bought it. I should have thought twice when I saw a BSL for $20. You can bet I won't use Amazon anytime in the near future.jdjay"
5,great book,This book is a great book. It is very detailed and indepth. I suggest it. It says everything I want to know.
3,"Good, but very lite on content","The quality of this DVD is very good. However, my one issue with it, is at a whopping 40? something minutes or so, it is extremely lite on any content. They cover the basics, but really don't put much of their personal experience into it. For example, they really don't cover what people's experiences have been like. If I'm a novice, what should I expect? How deep should we dive for these guys, any other clues to indicate what are good times ( weather, tides , etc. ) to go hunting for lobster. On the other hand I do thank these people for making a DVD for such a niche market. This must have been a labour of love, and not a high budget movie for profit venture."
2,Short Life and needs 4x4 Firewire to download,"My Camera PV-GS85 is a little over a year old, I did not use it for about 4 months took it out and DEAD, No lights at all even with a fully charged battery, and Power Cord. It has never been exposed to extreme heat or cold or dropped. I took it to a local camera shop to make sure it was not me, they said it was DEAD and would have to be sent to Panasonic. Also I did not like the fact that I could not use USB cord to download, had to buy a firewire cord 4x4 pin, should have been included. Also the Joy Stick is a little tricky . Now I am trying to figure out what to do with the DEAD camera only 6 months use, It was nice while it lasted, and died after the Warranty. If anyone has experience this please Post... Paid too much, for so little."
2,not sure if any GS85 is as faulty,"as mine. but mine possibly seemed to have poor (defective?) cmos sensor. As a result. autofocus was extremely slow and also resolution dropped too low even in the shade, not mentioning real low light. Overall picture quality in SP was worse than with my old Panasonic with same 680kpix sensor in LP. Maybe just my bad luck...Great features are: fantastic OIS; VERY comfortable finger controls; webcam capability."
1,You get what you pay for...,"I ordered and returned this item. Although the image quality wasn't as bad as the Canon ZR830 (which I also ordered and returned), the Panasonic was clunky to hold and had some odd limitations - which you learn all about if you read the reviews. The second I ordered it I wished I could spend $300 more for something HD...and that's what I ended up doing. If you're going back and forth trying to decide what's the best of the worst - this is it. But if you're going back and forth between SD and HD, stop wasting time and tell the old lady you're going to have to spend a little more for the quality of HD. Seriously."
3,Decent for the price,"Pros:1. Really easy and convenient to use2. 16:9 widescreen recording3. For Windows users, simply connect to the PC and use Windows Movie Maker to download your recordingsCons:1. Relatively short battery life2. USB 1.1 !! Inexcusable for a new product. It does have FireWire which is fast, but if you're a USB only person, then you're stuck with 1.13. The battery needs to be removed to connect USB or FireWire to the computer. Consequently, power needs to come to the camera from a cord hooked up to the battery charger... an inconvenience. What's even more irritating is that when you connect the battery charger to the camera to power it up, the battery stops charging... i.e. the charger will either charge the battery or feed power to the camera but not both! Really annoying since I'd like my battery to charge up while I'm downloading the recording."
3,"Great camcorder, but....","I bought this camcorder to record the birth of my daughter and must say was very happy with the results. I think it looks far better than the previous Panasonic range and has the OIS feature. They also have improved the LCD screen over the last model, which had that awful plastic hinge with a 2.7 inch widescreen display. The camera side is pretty crappy with a resolution of around 1/2 megapixel. What's bizarre is that the camcorder recognizes the new SDHC format, but what's the point of a high capacity card with such a dire resolution camera? Don't expect any loaded software either, it's up to you to make your own arrangements in that department, also no remote for when showing on the TV. Apart from that, a very nice, easy to use little camera."
4,Pleasing purchase - good recorder,"With all the choices you have when searching for a reasonably inexpensive camcorder, trying to find just the right one can be a little daunting. I was looking for something that didn't carry a huge price tag, but was of high enough quality to use as an every-day-events or catch-the-family-on-vacation type of recorder. Nothing fantastic, just something that was convenient and made good clear recordings. Well, I believe the PV-GS85 is a real winner. The image quality is impressive, better than I expected, and it's a real easy unit to use. Good optical zoom, good up close, good sound pickup. I haven't tried all the more advanced features yet, but I bought it for the basics. Glad I did. Oh, and it fits nicely into a number of the more generic camera/camcorder bags you can buy off the shelf."
3,Lovely but Nobody can Smell it!!!,This is such a beautiful fragrance but don't expect anyone to smell itcause they won't. I put it on generously but unless someone put their nose up against my skin they couldn't smell it. Not exactly worth the expense considering.What a shame.
4,BETTER SCENT THAN PINK SUGAR - BUT,"THE SCENT IS SWEET BUT LIGHTER THAN PINK SUGAR. THE SCENT DOES HAVE HINT OF COTTON CANDY WITH SWEET FLOWER MIXED IN. PINK SUGAR IS PURE COTTON CANDY SCENT. THE BOTTLE IS ADORABLE. PRINCESS IS A TOILETTE NOT PERFUME, IT WILL REQUIRE REAPPLYING. I SPRAYED IN THE MORNING BUT BY AFTERNOON SCENT IS MOSTLY GONE."
5,My new favorite perfume,I have to agree with every comment. I love it!!! I got this for Mother's Day and it is so young smelling and simply wonderful. A great scent for everyday wear.
3,Smells Great but a little pricey,This is a great perfume but a little pricey.There are cheaper high quality perfumes that smell just as good.
2,A perfume for young girls...not women,This perfume is definitely recommended for young girls...maybe ages 7-16. The perfume was compared to the baby soft product from days gone by...that is pretty accurate.
2,Nice fragrance,"It's definitely the ideal fragrance for me. However, it lasts only 10 minutes. It's not my skin because other perfumes last way longer on me."
2,"Ok, I bought it because it was called ""Princess""...","It doesn't last long at all. Like an hour if that. It's very light, it's a great perfume for a little girl, actually. Not for a woman, or not for me, anyway. It's not that I have anything at all against the scent itself, but it's just got substance or soul. I love the bottle! I love the color. I like the lid and the cut of the glass is great. It's more of a show piece to me than a workable scent, and one I like to look at and sniff but never choose to wear. And if I do, I know it can't be an all-day smell for it will wear off nearly instantly. I'm really surprised this won a fragrance of the year award for 2006. Design, sure. But perfume... it's hardly remarkable or memorable. But it is expensive!"
4,Intoxicating!,"When I first smelled this in a magazine, I had to take another sniff -I was not expecting it to smell as good as it did! I immediately ran out and purchased this perfume and have been wearing it ever since. This fragrance combines a blend of floral, fruity, the sweetness of candy & musk all rolled into one tantalizing smell. Although I can still smell it on my wrist more than 10 hours later, I feel the intensity of the smell dimishes after only a couple of hours which is why I gave it only 4 stars."
5,Love the entire series,This whole series kept me totally engaged. I read each of the books in about 1 or 2 days. I totally recommend!
4,Wouldn't really call it a ski jacket,"Got this for skiing and was shocked that it was so thin! But, actually, using the layers technique, it surprisingly did the trick. I realize now that you don't need a big bulky ski jacket to hit even the most chilly Colorado slopes. This worked fine, and kept me dry. Plus, I reckon I will be able to use it for rainy, cool days far from the slopes."
3,Not bad for a rain coat,"You should not get confused this with winter jacket, this is very thin can not protect you from any cold conditions. hand cuffs are a kind of elastic which I hate. I am yet to use it in a real heavy rain conditions"
4,Nice Jacket,"Lightweight jacket to be worn in fairly warm weather (since has no lining), excellent protection against the rain, and good quality for the price."
3,"Looks great, but flimsy quality.","I was disappointed when I got this jacket. There is basically no lining to the jacket. There is a mesh vent for your back but no lining anywhere else. All the pockets are exposed, as is all the stitching. Every time I take it off I feel like I'm taking off a garbage bag with the pocket lining flapping everywhere.It protects well from the rain, but it is far too flimsy for typical spring weather and temperature. The jacket looks nice from the outside, and has 4 pockets, but there is no comfort at all. I may have been expecting too much because of amazon's previous amazing deals on jackets, but in this case you get what you pay for."
3,Not Breatheable but waterproof,"This is a good jacket for carrying along on hikes for contingencies as it packs small, has 3 zippered pockets, a stowable hood, is waterproof and windproof, and looks great. But it is definitely NOT one that you would want to wear routinely while active because it is not breatheable. I carry it on my bike in case it rains, but if ever I have to put it on my arms and shoulders are dripping in no time. It is vented which helps a bit with the chest and shoulder areas, but not the arms. NOT a good deal anywhere close to the retail price, but at a closeout price under $20 I'd get another one."
3,Plastic feeling. Very hot and sticky.,Plastic feeling. Very hot and sticky on all but cold days. Not cut as long as it looks in photos.
3,Not bad,"I thought it would be thicker & warmer,but it turned out to be a really basic, no frills, somewhat flimsy outdoor jacket.Otherwise, it looks fine, but it's not a jacket for cold weather"
1,"Too thin, too bad","I don't know why this ite can be called Jacket. It looks good here, however likes a paper when you touch it. Bad material and bad function."
4,style and useful,"Columbia makes good and useful products, this specticular jacket is light and very convenience, including a hood to protect users when it's wet, too windy or rain...It's not mean to be used in very cold weather but very comfortable in the 50' or when it's just little chilly and wet. Furthermore it can be rolled and/or parked in a small piece.Its also a stylist product, which means you can use with your casual cloth, in a casual places, the color is stand out but not too the point it trying to get attention itself.Overall this is a quality product from a good, solid reputation likes Columbia and I highly recommended."
4,Good Jacket,This is a good lightweight Jacket. I have not taken it into much rain yet but has held up great in the wind.
3,good shell,"This is kind of a minimalist product - good for chilly or windy weather when you want to wear the least amount of protection that will still get the job done. It is most appropriate for hiking or similar outdoor activities, but is nice enough looking to get by on a college campus or informal work environment. The fabric feels rather uncomfortable against the skin so is better worn as a shell over a shirt or sweater, but is amazingly warm for its modest weight and it is easy to break into a sweat if you're active. Good value."
3,ok for $26,"it's cold when the wether is cold ,isnt cover inside ,that's make it sounds like plastic or nylon ,but the size is perfect"
4,Value for money,Looks great.. However I was expecting this to fit for my newphew but it fit me :). But it looks great.
1,Don't buy !!! You will be disappointed !!!,"This bagpack is ridiculously small. Believe me it cannot even fit 1 college book. The description did not say that it is for Elementary School kids. Believe me THIS BAG IS FOR ELEMENTARY SCHOOL KIDS. YES !!! IT IS THAT SMALL. I'm gave it as a present to my friends cousin, who goes to the elementary school. I am not kidding. The photo is misleading. It is unbelievably small. If you buy, you'll see."
1,Description lacking,The dimensions of this bookbag where not stated. The bookbag is extremely smaller than the photo depicts. I had to pay double shipping sending it back. A big disappointment.
2,passive,"yeats' advice to beware of poetry of ""passive suffering"" rings true with the (feigned) sentiments of this sophomoric effort. whereas Rita Dove's Thomas & Beulah derived from familial grounds, Van Jordan's hodgepodge hangs on its purported subject by a thin thread--unsure of it's direction and executed with a lackluster hand."
5,One of the Best.,"III is a record that gets into your head. The guitars and louder songs from one side are experimental and for the most part driven by a curious need to explore. The softer acoustic ballads that permeate the record are some of their truly best and most heartfelt, and they both add up to a pretty good time with a record that hasn't aged in the slightest. Lou Barlow and the noisier Eric Gaffney create an amalgamation of styles that fit in perfectly in some sort of genre defining indie record. There is so much to like here and there is also an entire other disc of rarities and b-sides to round out the package. Full five stars easily the remastering is quite nice."
2,'Caro's Secrets' are just that - secrets,"Caro's secrets are still secrets to me. Actually there are very good points and ideas in this book, but the book is poorly written. It might take several reads per topic to figure each one out. Mike should keep his day job and let someone else do his writing for him.Caro's other book, 'Poker Tells', has the same problem - good ideas but difficult to read."
4,A steal at this price,"Well worth the money. If you're new to poker, but wish to improve this is a good start. If you're seasoned you should have got it long ago. Will return your investment.... On second thought maybe I'd rather you didn't buy it. Forget what I said."
5,Mike is the master,"As a writer of 13 books on poker I have a world of respect for Mike Caro. I recommend his books and poker software to everyone who asks. The concepts he presents are powerful and well presented. He has rare insight into the minds of poker players and his strategies for winning are exceptional. Keep writing, Mike!"
2,odd,"What's here is good, but there isn't very much material, and it's not at all comprehensively presented."
1,Not useful,"This book reads more like a seminar summary than a real book, which isn't surprising, because that's what it is.What was surprising, to me (given the excellent reviews on this site) was the almost total lack of concrete, useful, practical information of the sort found in Ruben's ""Win At Poker"" (a much better--and cheaper--book). Caro tells you that when faced with a marginal decision, you need to incorporate more information--but he doesn't tell you what a marginal decision might be, and what sort of extra information you should look for.Maybe there are people this book will be useful for, but I wasn't one of them. If you don't already know how to calculate pot odds, what the odds against improving are for each given hand, how to calculate when you call or raise, then I'd strongly recommend that you get the Rubens book instead. Maybe I'll come back to this book later and get something out of it, but as a player who knew the rules and little of strategy, I found it almost useless."
4,Helpful with mental aspect of game,"I found this book to be very helpful with the mental aspects of poker. It gives some valuable advice on what you should be thinking when involved in games. The section on body language was helpful, but I would wait and get Caro's full length book on the subject."
2,very frustrating,"I used to be very fluent in Spanish and have had occasion over the past years the need to return to previous fluency. I also live in a city that is very bilingual and a state in which Spanish is an official language. I have lots of exposure to the Spanish language but want to refresh for pending international travel. I am approximately 70 pages into this review guide and hate it. These earlier pages are dedicated to verb conjugation and the coverage is far too sparse (too much all at once)and exercises often seem unrelated to immediately preceding text and rely too much on unfamiliar vocabulary. I am ready to return to a workbook I used previously,Practice Makes Perfect: Spanish Verb TensesI found that workbook very helpful."
4,Def a Kool Keith Album to PEEP!,I coped this album after seeing Keith live in Vancouver last April. This is a dope release and should not be slept on. It has more of a broader appeal than most Kool Keith albums. I highly recommend checking this out. It goes from sweet to filthy and back before you know it. Quite a headspin!!!
4,sleazy but cool,"well this is another nice kinda secret album which I found just recently and it`s all in all a pretty nice one. Kool keiths raps seems kinda refreshened and there are some nice tracks with cool beats. the rap and singing qualities of nancy u gotta get used to, but its an above average album for KK. its kind of like an more upscale version of his personal album, which by the way is pretty good too.definitely recommendable for KK fans. But those gotta have evry album anyway ;)peace"
4,Kool Keith can do anything,Keith is amazing. I am very rarely let down and find facination in his abilities to do his own thing and stay around so long!DEF 4****
3,Historical source,"Fab 5 Freddy, the first celebrated rapper, is the man who ought to know this material, but 10 years has elapsed and the ever-dynamic world of hip-hop has rendered this volume more historically interesting than topical."
2,Hollow sound distracts from performance,"While I'm no judge of Fidelio recordings, I found that the quality of this recording distracted from whatever enjoyment I would have found from listening. Recorded live, this recording has a hollow, distant sound the almost hides the orchestra and dulls the soloists.The only real value of this disk is due to its being (I think) the only Fidelio highlights disk available on Amazon (I have seen others in stores, including one from Karajan). Unless you must buy a Fidelio highlights disk here, I would not recommend buying this one."
4,Helpful cookbook,We bought a sandwich maker but it didn't come with a cookbook. I found this cookbook and thought it would be helpful. I have a 14 year old and there are lots of recipes in here that even he can make. It's great.
1,waste of my money,what i thought i was getting and what it actually is are TWO different things. I would of done better with figuring out the basics instead of buying this book
5,Amazing. <3,"alice nine., once again, created three amazing songs. And, of course, I was not surprised. ""White Prayer"" is a cool and amazing song, ""Sutorei Cat"" is a fun, pop-ish rock-ish song, and ""The Last Empire"" is an awsome song, with much English. I truly reccomend this CD, you will not be wasting your money, trust a fellow J-rock fan. Support alice nine. <333"
1,Only 3 songs,"problem is that the description did not include a track listing; so we thought we were getting an album's worth of songs ... once opened, no returns, so we're stuck. Amazon needs to put detailed song lists with ALL of their CD's"
4,"A good book, not super great, but worth reading,","This book was about adventure and love, er, friendship. Eddings catpured manny views of wizardry, honor, and intelect. This was a good book, and it IS worth reading."
3,Eddings should have stayed with the Belgariad/Mallorean.,"It's not good enough to be satisfying ,there is too little action and too much politics and i hate politics. The three stars i give are going out to Sparhawk and Kalten.they are the only ones who make me laugh(a little).I'm not going to read book nr.3"
2,Oh my god it's so slow!,This book as an OK story if you can stand reading it long enough to get to some of the good parts. All they do for most of the time is talk about strategies and the past and other boring topics that sometimes don't even matter. The jokes aren't even funny in this book. I've read some good books by David Eddings but this is DEFINITELY not one of them.
1,To read this book means to waste a great deal of time,I really liked David Eddings' Belgariad and Malloreon books but the Tamuli Saga shows how poor Eddings' writing style is. This book doesn't have a climax and the protagonist is never in real danger. The plot was so boring that I was always tempted to read another book. Some characters in this book behave in such a childish way that I wondered why Del Rey published such a low quality book.
2,Great plot the first time,"Although I am a huge fan of the Belgariad and the Mallorean, I must say I was disappointed. This is another sad Eddings entry into the epic fantasy genre. The standard plot -- retrieve the good blue rock, foil evil religious types -- begins to pale after the sixth or seventh rehash. The characters are also stale and old. Sephrenia the mother figure, Sparhawk the gruff but tenderhearted warrior hero, Talen the sly thief, etc etc. The characters ramble through uninspired prose studded with the same jokes used in the Belgariad (to better effect, the first time).If you like Eddings, stay away from the Tamuli as well as the Elenium. It gets better (slightly) with Polgara the Sorceress."
4,nice story,"The Eddings did a nice job with this story. While I did not think it was quite as good as the Belgariad and the Malorean, it was a well writen story with likeable characters. It is sad that David and Leigh Eddings are no longer with us as I would read anything they wrote. Highly recomended."
3,"It's only entertainment but I like it, pt. 2","In fact, why should I review this book when I've already posted my opinion of the first book of the Tamuli, and there's no difference whatsoever between these two epics. Well, let's just say that in The Shining Ones, the characters keep wandering around cracking brilliant jokes and smashing the bad guys up. Nothing could go wrong with this recipe, and nothing also goes. But it's a bit questionable if anything goes in the right direction either. There are far worse ways of spending time, and of course anyone that likes DE's style will have to read this series."
5,Granny want some Kolon Blo,"First off, Killdozers eat bulldozers for breakfast, semis for lunch and airliners at suppertime. They can take your song and stretch it out for a whole album, and make you feel so jealous and inferior, you will literally drown in your tears. A few words of warning to the ultra tender-hearted: this kind of kerfuffle is so intense, it will spin your bowels around like a potato sack of kittens dropped into a raging sea among the craggy rocks. You'll be a hell-on-wheels grandma sitting in the cab of a three-story-high monster truck, armflab a flag of rusting flesh waving in the wind as you adjust the outside mirror to better view highway patrol vehicles flipping as you dump exacto knives onto the roadway. Bam! Fwipp! You can wake up from your nap now."
3,Live Your Life Like You Don't Exist,"Anyone who doesn't like Killdozer is lame. If you're new to the band get 12 Point Buck first, then check out the others. You'll need all of them. Like fine wine, Killdozer tapes get better with age.Check out Mighty High...In Drug City"
1,"I hate to admit to buying [this], but...","Imagine, Mojo Nixons unfunny, mentaly challenged, red headed stepchild. You almost have Killdozeer. Now imagine that he dosen't sing as good as Mojo.Now imagine a musically impared Tom Waits; but he quit smoking about six months before his voice really turned into anything besides a low growl.That's Killdozer.Kind of my fat, beer drinking uncle; without the talent!"
2,"Just The Facts, Man!","I, like many men ages 16-35 enjoy reading random yet interesting facts. I bought this book in hopes of learning somethings. I've learned quite a bit from this book but what I don't like is that I have to read a very, very long backstory before I get to the ""little known fact"". I would rather read just the interesting fact. It's not a bad book but it wasn't exactly what I was looking for."
2,Hogwash,"This book is full of hogwash. Many of the dates are wrong. Many of the items cannot possibly be true. Yet the book sells and people believe the stories it contains! After all these years, not one person has dared to criticize or question these so-called facts! Am I the only one missing the joke? How do publishers get away with publishing ""facts"" which are blatantly false? The book may be interesting reading, but it is fiction!"
3,It's All Here,"I guess the concept of glossary and phrase finders was not a part of the Indian literature scene. While not desiring a Norton critical edition, I hoped to be able to sort without exhaustive reading. Though a collection, it comes short of being a reference."
5,Back into paradise?,"Well, not really. Though we sometimes wish to return to childhood and have all its privileges, we forget about the difficulties children have to confront in their day-to-day life. And they are as stressing to children as our problems are to us.Korczak is a man who understood and loved children till his death (for more information about his life, read my review on Ghetto Diary). In this book he alerts adults to children's lack of power when confronting the world. How to deal with day-to-day fears, novelties, anxieties, and oppressing teachers?The book reminds me of a famous quote by Pablo Picasso: ""Every child is an artist. The problem is how to remain an artist once we grow up."" It is our responsibility to let children grow up in a healthy creative environment, and this can be done only by respecting and understanding children's feelings. This is what this book teaches us."
1,Gigantic Disaster,"For those who like paintings done by primates throwing ink on canvas or a-tonal music with no harmonic center, this may tantalize. Certainly there is a clever use of diction and syntax to cover up what is not there - and there is nothing to cover up - no clear plotting, no rising or falling action, weak or at best flat characterization. This is a Wall Street junk bond - worthless."
1,Never got product,I had to email the seller several times to check on why I hadn't received this product. Finally he had someone send it off and it was a 45 not a 30. Although I was very frustrated at this point he told me to keep the tube and I received my money back the same day on my account.
4,Nichols Understands the Human Condition,"Having read ""The Milagro Beanfield War"" and ""Nirvana Blues"", I was anxious to finish his New Mexican trilogy. I could not find the book, however, and off I went in search of his other work. I was deeply impressed by the aforementioned books, especially by his treatment of characters, his probing of conflicting emotions in complex situations. Often, Nichols characters seemed to be lamenting their lives, feeling as though they have missed out. These characters are generally middle age or older. However, in this book the main character is around 11 years old. The thoughts and emotions of this prickly young boy are written with such authenticity and cleverness, it's as though Nichols is conjuring up a real person. It is depressing at points, as most of the characters grapple with their senses of mortality, but there is something distinctly uplifting about it."
4,a great novel.,"An orphaned boy goes to live with his relatives, and he slowly finds a new home. I enjoyed this book. The paperback with the cover of the porch scene is wonderful.I think the other reviewers were too harsh on this novel. I really liked it.Also, even if you've seen the movie, read ""The Milagro Beanfield War,"" by Nichols. A super story!The Milagro Beanfield War: A Novel"
1,"Terrible, don't waste your money","This has got to be one of the most awful books ever written. The main storyline takes forever to get going, the whole idea is uninteresting and downright boring, and the ending is abrupt and rather pointless. The book goes off on random tangents which culminate with half-developed characters that are never explained and contribute absolutely nothing to the story. I had to read this for an English class, so I had to buy and read it. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS GOD-AWFUL BOOK. The reviews they list on the back and front of the book must have been written by either people paid to say good things about the book or monkeys on crack. (or monkeys on crack paid to say good things about the book)"
1,very poor quality,My son has had the back pack for 2 weeks now and it is falling apart!Very very porr quality! Not worth the money spent. Very disappointed. Do not buy.
1,Did not work for me,"When I first saw this thing I was very skeptical, and after using it a few nights my intuition was right - a waste of money. I found it extremely uncomfortable and got a few terrible nights sleep. What it does is keep you sleeping on your side all night, with your head in an odd position. I think the concept of an anti-snoring pillow may work, so I will try one more brand. You can't return this item."
1,pillow doesn't work,"We would have to agree totally with all the negative reviews posted here. The pillow simply does not work as it claims. My husband found it extremely uncomfortable (it was difficult to place his arm properly) and woke up with aches & pains on top of still snoring all night. We were at least warned about the no return policy before we bought it so knew the risk that if it didnt' work we'd be out the cost, but after many other attmepts to stop his snoring we decided to give this a try because of its claims (and positive reviews on other sites claiming it works - we should have checked here first)."
1,Don't Buy This,"I purchased this as a gift and the recipient found the product caused choking and no decrease in snoring. When the recipient tried to return to Brookstone, they were denied. When I tried through Amazon's A-Z gaurantee, I was denied. Don't buy this product unless you are sure it will work for you."
1,IT DOESN'T WORK,"I bought this for my husband and it was a complete waste of money. It's very high and hard and it gave him a headache. We threw it away and he started sleeping with a second pillow. That worked and now he doesn't snore anymore. Save your money. And by the way, they won't take it back."
1,Brookstone Should be Ashamed,"I purchased this pillow, but think it isnot worth the price. The same results can beobtained from any other pillow by simply sleepingon ones side with an arm underneath a regular pillow.This product requires a unique pillow case, and theone(s) provided by Brookstone and made in China areso flimsy and so cheap! The zipper will pull off quicklyand the material used for the case is very low quality.The guy shown using the pillow in the ad is using thepillow without a pillowcase---I wonder how long one coulddo this without cleaning!!"
4,Active Reading Skills,An excellent book for one of my college reading classes. It really brought me back to reading strategies that have been long lost over the years. A really great tool for someone who wants to get re-acquainted with their reading skills.
4,LIKE NEW,"BOOK LIKE NEW, GOOD CONDITION AND DELIVERDVERY FAST. GOOD CHOICE. THANK YOU.I'LL TRY AGAIN FOR MY NEXT COURSE"
2,Dissappointing,"This book had such great reviews, I had to buy it. Now I'm glad I didn't spend very much money on it. The first half of the book is slow and, at times, boring. The ending was supposed to be good, according to the reviews, but I found it to be dissapointingly predictable.I do not agree with the assertion that this is a book for both kids and adults. As a fourth grader, I believe I would have found ""The Thief"" interesting, but as an adult reader, I found it to be quite dissapointing."
4,"slow start, excellent finish","The beginning lacks action and has a few too many info dumps--but the characters are engaging enough to push through that. The second half really picks up--not only in action, but by then, you're totally immersed in the character's well-being. Even if you skim the first few chapters, the book is definitely worth a read. It's clever, with unexpected twists and fun challenges."
3,chapter 8,Im my opinion the book does not get good until chapter 8.But once it is in chapter eight it gets pretty good. It is about a thief in prison named Gen caught stealing the king's seal.Then the king's magus promises to free him if he comes on an expedition with him to steal Hamiathe's gift.It goes on for a while about there travel wich I think is rather dull but then it gets exciting with occasional fighting and alof of theft.I rated this book only three stars simply because I am a kid and I just personally didn't enjoy the first half of the book.Once I got into the book though it was definately good.Infact I actually believe this book deserves four stars. Im just being brutally honest.
5,how old is Gen anyway?,"One very interesting point about this book, and I admire the author for pulling it off, is that Gen as a character can appeal to a wide variety of ages. Somehow, the author has written Gen in such a way that you can read whatever age onto him that you want. I know people who thought Gen was as young as twelve or thirteen, and others who thought that he was closer to twenty. It's a very interesting tactic, I don't know if it was deliberate on the part of the author, but it certainly increases the possible audience for the book. I know as a child and teen I preferred books with characters my own age, or slightly older, and I don't think this is uncommon. With this book, Gen can be the age of the reader, whether the reader is 12 or 20. Check it out."
5,Very entertaining,"I really enjoyed this book a lot. Gen, a common thief, had bragged his way into prison. But soon the Magnus, hearing the of Gen's reputation, takes Gen out of prison and onto a journey to steal something out of a fairy tale. Accompany the Magnus, and Gen on the journey are Sophos and Ambiades, Gen names as the Uselesses, and Pol.Very entertaining book about there journey to steal what Gen believes is a fairy tale. All characters have there own personality which makes the book even better. I love the Sophos character how he is always asking questions even at the worst times. Of course I like the main character Gen, always having something witty to say. Pol is great too, always quietly there to get Sophos out of trouble.The book takes a sudden twist at the end that I didn't even see coming. I thought it was well done. I can't wait to read the next book in the series: The Queen of Attolia."
3,3.5 Stars for The Thief,"The Thief probably deserves 3.5 rather than just 3 stars. I liked certain things - especially the protagonist's humor as it made him likable. The book gives a good picture of the time period (the dark ages), makes the reader sympathize with the Thief, and the ending is a nice surprise, but I had a problem with the number of apocryphal tales of gods and goddesses included. I skipped almost all of them and lost nothing of the story line."
5,Brother Rick,I liked this book. It held my attention. There were characters in it that I wanted to follow. The action was constant and consistent. If flowed well. Very enjoyable.
2,Not Worth It,"Why anyone would ever give this book a good review is beyond me. I picked it up one day, and expected a good read since it had been a Newbery Honor Book. When I read the first page, I found it interesting and kept going. As it went along, the plot simply got harder and harder to follow. It seemed as though the author got so wrapped up in the details she almost forgot about the central plot. I gave this book two stars only because of those almost too-real details. Overall, I didn't think this book was fully worth all the time I put into reading it. Struggling through the sea of words is a labor in itself, let alone trying to follow it!"
1,this book is horrible!,"I thought I would love this book. But it is absolutly attrocious. bad plot, nothing happens for the first half, confusing, boring, I didn't care about what happened in their stupid kingdom. I read half of it and couldn't keep going. Don't make the same mistake I didGinevra Davis, 6th grade"
2,i think the thief a was a pretty good but kinda boring,i think it was a fair book except that it was kinda boring and hard to understand
4,Great!,"I really liked this book. It was a great adventure, although it could be slow at some parts.The descriptions of the land were beautiful and I loved the ending!"
4,pretty good,"It was a pretty good book!It got really exciting when Gen had to get the necklase of internial life.Gen was really scared when he first met the Magus,but he got use to him after a few days.At first he was in jail but he got by the Magus.I really liked the suprise ending."
3,"Book was exciting, but confusing at times.",We agree with the reading level suggesting that the book is meant for young adults starting no earlier then middle school age. This book would be a good read aloud for 5th grade level kids. We felt some events dragged on.
4,"My Son's Favorite Series, currently","My son discovered this book in his school library two years ago. He has since read the entire series. With this book, he completed his purchase of the series. His only disappointment is that this cover art is not available in hardcover. We are still looking."
5,an impressive imaginary world,"It is hard to understand why anyone would object to an imaginary world on the ground that it does not follow the chronological development of our own and includes geography that is clearly inventive and fictional. On this principle, we would have to dismiss almost all literaure except that small category called ""historical fiction"" whose purpose is to teach history. Even historical fiction makes useful adjustments to history, but THE THIEF cannot be mistaken by a competent reader for historical fiction. The imaginary world it offers is exceptionally impressive, and teaches us much about our own, but is obviously not a textbook on classical antiquity."
3,SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO COOL,"I LOVED this book! The plot and characters are amazing. The mythology tied the book together. The way it ended, about him knowing everything, was so cool. This is one of my all time favorite books. I highly recomend this book to all. It's a little confusing. You really have to follow it to get the end, but it is so worth it. I give it 100 stars, a perfect book."
3,Pretty Good,"It's not the best book, nor is it the worst. To me, it was slightly above average. Gen was an interesting main character -- even though he has the tendancy to sleep a lot -- and he was my favorite. But plot-wise, this book was a bit lacking. The majority of the time they're walking, and there were only two eventful, worthwhile scenes. Other than that it was pretty mellow and could get a tad boring."
5,Incredible Series.....buy it!!,"I bought the first book in the series to see if it would be a fun read for my 14 year old son. I was 30 minutes into the title when I quickly paused to buy the remaining books in the series. Wow....what an incredible fantasy series! My normal tastes include the ""Song of Ice and Fire"" series, ""Malazan"" series, ""The Wheel of Time"" and so forth. This particular series was every bit as good as the aformentioned. I finished all four books in less than two weeks in my spare time, which is unusual for me, since I usually try to savor a book for a while. My only wish is that the series were longer than it is. FYI....I'm a 40+ adult, and never felt like I was reading a YA title."
3,Not quite what I expected,I had high expectations for this book after all the high reviews. Unfortunately it did not live up them. I didn't hate the book but it didn't sweep me away either. The characters and the last part of the story is what I enjoyed best. I least enjoyed the monotonous journey that they took. It seemed to take forever for them to get from point A to point B. The only reason (it seemed) for this long journey was for character development. But nothing much really seemed to happen around this time and I found myself very bored.Not sure if I'll read the 2nd book or not. I might but it will probably be a while before I do.
3,Adult user,"This is an excellent tool for a higher-grade student who needs help with spelling because Spelling Ace doesn't offer any extra information that might be used for cheating. It fits inside the adult hand and is light (it isn't going to weigh down a briefcase, purse or knapsack). The lid is not very secure and I snapped it off while taking it out of the shipping container but I was able to snap it back together. The spelling software is decent and is more phonetic than the spell checkers found in traditional PC software. The price is right! The only caveat I have is that wouldn't recommend it for anyone with visional perception issues because the digital lower case letters are difficult to differentiate."
2,Good spell checker but broke easily,"We bought this spell checker for my daughter. She was able to more easily and quickly check her spelling without using a computer. But the cover doesn't protect the screen very well, and the screen cracked after my daughter accidentally put her bookbag down so that the spell checker was underneath the books."
4,great use in the classroom,I use these with my third graders in the classroom and have recommended them to parents whose kids' just flounder when it comes to spelling.
1,Inferior Product,"I have a Wordmaster, also manufactured by Franklin. It's about 15 years old, and far superior to this Spelling Ace. I did a random test for synonyms, using the words ""heard"", ""bury"", ""relish"" and ""wonder"".The Spelling Ace produced a total of 19 synonyms for these 4 words. My 15-year-old Wordmaster gave me me a total of 80.I'm sorry I wasted my money on this product, but fortunately, I still have the old one"
1,franklin spelling ace with thesaurus,It didn't work. I returned it. Was it added to my account? How do I see what amount is left ?
4,frankin spelling ace,"has a lot of functions, half of which i will never use, but its there just in case. glad i got it."
4,A pretty good dictionary,"I like this thesaurus quite a lot. It has a good dictionary, simalar wordchoices from the one typed in, and some neat games. I can also take it anywhere. But the definitions aren't very good, and the top breaks off easily."
3,Same as other video,"This is virtually identical to the other video by her, ""Yoga for Gasto/Intestinal ... "" There's just one segment cut. This is disappointing, since these are the only yoga videos available to Amazon prime members for free."
3,good not great,"pros:-good pacing-good stretches-nice low-to-medium intensity workoutcons:-low production value, mostly the audio. there are some odd distracting background noises throughout the video-instructor's voice is often difficult to understand, due to thick accent and awkward phrasing (eg, 'retain your breath' vs 'hold your breath')"
3,What about headaches?,"I love the yoga routine in this video, but I was disappointed because I was expecting more focus and information on headaches since that is the title of the DVD. Perhaps the routine is designed to help headaches, but I would have liked some specific mention of headaches in the video - which poses are specifically designed to help prevent headaches? I also would have liked information about which poses are best for preventing headaches and which ones are best to do when you actually have a headache. There are several mentions of how certain poses are good for other physical problems, so why wasn't there any discussion of headaches?"
2,like a home video,"The almost amateurish production of the DVD initially did not bother me (although it may bother some!). What I found to be most disappointing about this DVD is that the two parts ('basics' and 'headaches') are almost identical. Why bother calling one 'basics' and the other 'headaches' if there ie almost no difference (if there is. it should be explained to us)? The order of the moves are changed ever so slightly and one is 3-4 minutes longer than the other. The producers did not even bother with two takes, just edited one take and placed under two different headings.The editing overall is not good, the instructor starts explaining one move and then the editor cuts to another move. The sound is also bad, it is difficult to hear the instructor.Overall, if this was a home-made video a friend of mine had passed on to me, I would have probably appreciated it. But not as a DVD for which I had to pay this amount of money!"
1,Terrible,"Just went through the first minutes, terrible yoga class with a strong focus on throwing Chi-signs in the air with your hand closing off one or 2 nostrils....."
4,Good for introduction to yoga,"My husband and I just got started with yoga and are checking out all of the videos. This one had a great pace, easy to follow and was quite relaxing - not just poses... but really focused on breath. I like instructors accent and her energy was great."
4,"Beautiful Clock, but...","The entire back is plastic, there were no instructions enclosed in how to set the alarm, alarm is not very loud. If it weren't for it being John Wayne, and the costs, I would have returned it."
4,I laughed out loud -- a lot,"I didn't grow up anywhere near the book's New York City setting and I'm a bit younger than the primary characters, but I recognized enough of their lives to joyfully follow along. And their younger significant others -- ""the kids"" -- can be hilarious and infuriating at the same time. This is the first of Morden's books I've read, but I'll be getting others. I was touched at times by the relationships (the differences in how characters act in groups vs. when they are alone with their partners.) While the book deals with some serious topics, such as AIDS and cheating partners, it's certainly not all serious. At one point, I was laughing so hard my eyes squinted so I couldn't see to read. Yeah, there are gay stereotypes all over the place. But who cares? I still really enjoyed it."
4,Love it!,Great product. Just need a pump so I don't have to refill my smaller bottles. These are too bulky.
3,Introductory to lower intermediate information-terse,"Book covers, from a practical view, all the basics and introduces enough advanced topics such that a knowledgeable reader will know there is a LOT more to routing that what is covered in this book. Book is not sufficient to configure a cisco router properly beyond absolute basic operation. Author injects personal opinion in many discussions without factual correlation using any specific examples. A good introductory book, for persons with computing backgrounds, presenting the many facets of routing and complexity of internetworking in a multiprotocol environment. Did not buy, not a comprehensive tutorial, and to shallow for reference."
3,I was expecting more INTERNET oriented book,"Maybe the name was misleading, but surely this book was written for persons operating company intranets than for people connecting to internet or working at ISPs. Even the name of the book has TCP/IP on it, the text misspells TPC/IP. Also, several oversimplifications about the Internet made me upset."
5,great book,"excellent book to learn the basics about Cisco router. Finally, a book of commands and WHEN to use them."
5,Best Technical book ever crossed my way,"This book has actually helped me again and again to solve routing problems across our campus. The writer brings a clear sharp picture of the routing world and how to implement it using Cisco routers. To the auther I can say: ""Thank you, and I'm looking forward to your next book !"""
1,Disappointed,"This book does not provide the theory behind the technology and will not prepare you for certification either.It shows you how to do a few things that the ""author"" wants to show you and NEVER goes into detail about them. The author will ""see little point"" in going into something and tell you nothing about it.This book is definitely a beginner level that will not drown you."
2,Mediocre,"On the back cover, the book reads:'Make the most of the leading router technology with the in-depth manual you never got from cisco!'I hope you noticed the word 'in-depth' then I wonder why when I tried to get some IS-IS information, on page 120 all the writer has to say is said in a paragraph and the last line reads:'Nothing more will be said of Integrated IS-IS, because I recommend that if you want to use a link state protocol, you use OSPF.'HAAA need I say more about this book!Chris, it is none of your damn business to tell the reader what to use or not. When you took the task of writing a book on cisco tcp/ip, then you had better covered IS-IS 'in-depth'. When I pick up a book to read about satanism, it does not neccessarily mean that I'm planning to adopt satanism. I might just be reading for the sake of getting to know what satanism is all about, right?"
5,The best book on TCP/IP and routers,Chris is simply the best author. He gives you what you need to know. He teachs how and why things are done. I recommend this book to anyone serious about learning CISCO routers and IP routing.
5,A book for the stressed Cisco Engineer. Plain English,"The book is direct and to the point. It doesn't float over subjects, and give you the ""I don't know to much about this, so I'll tell you what you already know"" deal. It gets into what you WANT to find out about. Also specifies the little things you may not know, EVEN if you consider yourself an EXPERT. Please don't buy any book just to pass a test ! BUY it if you want to LEARN and USE !! SAY NO TO PAPER CERTS."
4,"If you do routers, this is a MUST...","I was relativity new with the Cisco routers, but ain't no more. This book was a great help in solving a lot of issues with real world problems. I rated 4+ stars because of the ease of reading. (1) The book doesn't have a lot of 19 letter words to leave you scratching your head. (2) It was easy to understand what was said and most of all, I was able to configure the routers with little difficult. Ever try using the shipping manual? I didn't give the book 5 stars because only God gets the best. Thanks Chris... great job on the book."
4,Would be five stars if ...,"... the publisher would be totally honest about the scope and depth of this book and alter the title to read ""Cisco TCP/IP Routing Basic Reference"".When I was first dropped into the position of having to know routing, and knew nothing, I was lucky enough to begin with this book. One of the most concise and readable basic level introductions to networking and routing that I have ever seen. This book is a wonderful beginning level text for those of you who have never seen or worked with a Cisco router before but will be doing so shortly.My one complaint is the use of the word ""Professional"" in the title. This text is nowhere near the technical level or depth of what I would consider required to be considered a professional in the field of networking, much less to be considered as a professional when it comes to working with Cisco equipment. But like I said, one of the best introductary level books I've come across.PJZ"
3,Sing-A-Long: The Wizard Of Oz [KARAOKE],"We used this cd for rehearsals for the production of Wizard of Oz, the music is great, its easy for kids to sing along to too.It also has all songs sung by a performer so that you can learn the tunes.Although the music was not as upbeat and as musically as I would have preferred, it still was very easy for the children to sing along to."
3,Word wizard for Oz.........,"Thank you for the opportunity to participate in a critiquing session. Honored as I am, I feel it unfair to even venture a rating although I see I must. The best I could swing would be a three out of a possible five. Why? I am a KJ. The visual presentation of Karaoke CD&G is paramount to it's worth. I know how my karaoke junkies, as I call them lovingly, react to a disc which present words that are not in-sync with the music or color cues that ""don't"". So, if you want to know about the audio presentation...excellent! But, that's not all there is to CD&G, folks! Would I buy it? I'd take a chance. If the graphics are as good as the music.....keep those catalogs comin'!"
1,Brand name no guarantee,"No nicks or cuts? Not in MY experience.These razors nicked me four times in a single shave.I was delighted at the low price for a brand name razor until I used them.I must use these razors with extreme caution to avoid getting nicked.Reports of close shaves obtained I cannot agree with.I get much better results with no nicks from the Personna blades I'd bought numerous times before finding these bargain razors from Schick.Personna hit that sweet spot between price and quality. I'd hoped Schick has produced a product aimed at budget consumers like myself.""Disappointment"" doesn't begin to describe my experience.Schick would do well to check the QA on this product line. I'm going back to Personna blades before people mistake my scar tissue for a goatee."
2,Not what I thought....,"I thought these were like Wilkinson Sword's old ""Colours"" brand. That's what a search told me anyway. They're not the same. The shipping cost was positively OUTRAGEOUS!"
3,surprisingly good plastic razor,"I tried the shick twin blade disposable razors and was surprised how good they were! the blade actually gives me a smooth,close comfortable shave! I still prefer the other shick disposable with the white sliding safety cap but these cut my beard just fine. dear people you may wanna try a pack of these they are pretty good and would be great to carry along on your next vacation trip. I recommend them!"
2,Unhelpful Transliteration,"Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this map. The transliteration of names into English is not too good, on occasion to the point where you cannot recognize them sometimes, and names in the original scripts are not included. Further, some towns and villages are shown on the map that don't seem to exist, while existing ones are excluded - maybe this is due to outdatedness as others have mentioned. In total, I found the small maps within the Lonely PlanetGeorgia Armenia & Azerbaijan (Multi Country Guide)a lot more helpful than this map. Note that this map shows large parts of Georgia, but the best maps for Georgia at various scales are available from Geoland (in Tbilisi and online: geoland.ge)."
3,Vintage Van Vogt,"This collection brings together some of the better short stores by the late A.E. Van Vogt (1912-2000), a Canadian science fiction writer who first rose to prominence in the 1940s. Van Vogt remains a much-praised and much-criticized author. At his worst, he produced implausible pulp fiction, with no scientific basis. At his best, his writing had a kind of bold, archetypal power. His stories were wildly imaginative, strikingly original for their time, and contained unusual plot twists, such as the role reversals in The Monster and Enchanted Village. Many of his ideas would eventually be adapted into films. Black Destroyer was one of the inspirations for Alien. The space vampire concept in Asylum would be used many times in film and television. Van Vogt did not possess the intellectual quality of some other science fiction writers, and certainly was no great literary stylist. But his stories were concise, compact, and often succeeded in entertaining the reader."
3,Audiovox Sirius Radio,"This Satellite Radio Receiver only has 5 frequencies that you can use to tune into on your car stereo. The area in which we live,(Eastern PanHandle of WV), those frequencies already have something on them that causes interference, so we are forever switching freguencies. We can use this radio on our home stereo though. It's big and bulky, and it gets hot setting on the dash of the car, but other then these problems we like the radio. We also have the Sirius Sportster Satellite radio that works better in the car because you can use any freguency and is a smaller radio."
2,miss leading ads and bad customer care,Fist you should know that while sirius advertises you get 120 commercial free music channels65 talk channelssports including all NFLfree online listening for subscriberswhat they dont tell you the online listening is only of the music channels even though they print it too look like you can get all the services online they don't broadcast any sports or talk online.also while they don't have commerials thyte still have DJ's that come on EVERY 2 or 3 songs and talk about nothing to do with the music usualy to tell you about another channel or another show (which in my oppinion is still a commercial just for their own service) not a whole lot more music than fm
1,Audiovox recieiver is a waste of money,I bought the Audiovox receiver. Less than 45 days later the metal antenna connector pins (3) began to snap off. The unit is supposed to be mobile between house and car but the design is so bad that actually moving the unit around damages it quite easily. I returned it to Audiovox ( well within the warranty period). They would require $80.00 to repair. Plus about 6 weeks or more. So I'll be switching to XM radio and probably the Sony receiver. Do not waste your money on the Audiovox.
1,reception,"I would not have bought this unit if they told me it would cut out all the time on back roads were there are trees. advice to all who want this dont do it for your auto, it is no good buy cds"
3,It's okay but,"The receiver has two issues that have to be considered. First this guy gets really hot. Both in the car and in the home. Heat was the cause of a failure of this item in my house (the fm modulator died) - Audiovox did send me a free replacement, but I was out of use for a few weeks. The other issue is signal strength. The FM modulator could use a boost. When traveling, I have to change the frequency to get a solid signal. Otherwise I get interference from other stations in the 88.1 to 88.7 range. Is there something better? I tried the JVC and it's cooler, but the signal strength of the FM modulator is no better."
1,radio ok but customer service kills sirius radio,"radio is ok, but nothing could be good enough to overcome the rude customer service dept.they basically told me they don't care and they can back it up.try a basic call to customer service before you buy and compare what they tell you as opposed to there terms and services page.that makes for some intresting entertainment.when customer service fixes itself sirius radio will be good."
1,No more technical support for PNP2,"I had one of these receivers for about 5 years and it was reliable. Well, it just finally died, and Audiovox does not make satellite receivers anymore and cannot provide any technical support. Because of the long reliability, I am happy with Audiovox and I am happy with Sirius/XM radio, but beware of buying this product which is no longer supported."
1,"Great service, crappy hardware",I've been enjoying SIRIUS for about a year now. It is absolutely a terrific service.The Audiovox SIRPNP2 is a complete piece of crap. The first one I had crapped out on me and I regret I exchanged it for a new one rather than a different model receiver. The second one just crapped out and the warrantee is over. (...).
1,Sirius Bites,"We have an AudioVox receiver. The instructions to install and tune were awful. It took two weeks and four calls to Sirius Customer Service to work out the issues. They had to boost our signal...and we had to change stations several times. We still get static.On top of that, Sirius hosed us out of a $50.00 rebate, and despite my calling them several times.....they refuse to let me speak to someone about their error. Each time 'Customer no Service' tells me I need to do something else, or tell me they are putting me on an escalation list, or they send me to a dead phone line. They keep sending me generic rejection cards in the mail. I jumped through major hoops to get the rebate in and on time. They asked for everything except my first born in order to qualify. Even though I did everything the rebate said 'to the letter'...they refuse to pay."
5,My personal Favorite,"This book is great. The only problem with it is i didn't like the ending (same with Foundation Edge) but after reading it again , i decided that it was good one. Schwartz a cool and description of earth is good. Best asimov book by far (and his first, ironic)"
3,Not bad but Dallas little flat.,It's hard not to think of this book in terms of the Foundation series but it doesn't quite live up to those standards. Still a good read.
5,Classic Si Fi,I have been reading Science Fiction since 1955. Lately The publishers have been reissuing some of the books that I enjoyed so much in my youth. This is certainly one of them.
3,Not as Good as Expected,Pebble in the Sky is clearly an inmature writer's work. Too many tangents and too wordy and too many unveiled references to the bigotries of the time (when written).Asimov's The End of a Eternity is a much superior work.
2,Yikes!,"I have read many books by the ""MASTER"". My favourite author by far. Never mind the outdated science or the religious parallels, the story is just plain bad. Characters in power too easily manipulated for one thing. The Galaxy is in potential peril and the Procurator figures he would wait it out and see if it's true instead of investigating. The denouement felt like he had to finish the story because he had a train to catch.That's enough of me complaining on the MASTER's work.How can anyone give this story 5 stars is beyond me."
3,Not as good as it was,"I've recently been rereading Asimov; some from my own collection, others from the library. I've decided I need to stop since they aren't holding up.Pebble in the Sky starts slow, but Asimov slowly creates an intriguing world and several characters that seem to have a little more depth than usual (for both Asimov and that era of science fiction.) Unfortunately, the plot soons starts to stumble. Then come several absurd twists and a rather silly ""all too convenient"" ending.Yeah, it's still worth reading, just not critically."
2,"Games, and more games!",This book is nothing more than a collection of games. Practice must be based on theory. The authors' approach will not lead to lasting change.
3,Ok...,"I have not had a chance to use the book yet, since my class was canceled. But I have looked over some of the subjects and this seems like a really informative book, I look forward to using it."
3,ok condition,the book was a little older and being used than I taught but in an ok condition. the shipping took a little longer than i was expected too but i wasn't in rush. over all im happy with the purchase.
1,On line let down,"I will never buy used again. I needed this book for school, and the pages I needed to complete my assignments were torn out, so thanks for nothing. I wasted time and money thinking I could get a less expensive deal on line. Never no more. From here on out I'll buy new, but because the seller represented Amazon.com, I will not buy anything from your website anymore."
5,Great condition!,"The book was delivered promptly and it was in great condition for a used book, no highlighting or other marks anywhere on it. I was very pleased with this purchase."
4,Kristi's Review of HF0DVD,"Excellent DVD, but wish they'd shown more of the deleted scenes and bloopers. Nice to see the tribute to the original, and see the places where they shot everything. Good to see the behind the scenes on the pilot."
5,HAWAII FIVE-O!!!,Hawaii Five-O is back and I love this DVD set. I watched all of the episodes on TV and now I can watch them whenever I want. The product is great!
2,NOT A FAMILY SHOW,"I INJOYED THIS SHOW VERY MUCH, BUT THERE ARE TO MANY BIKINI GIRLS IN THERE, MACGARET IS SO GOOD BUT HIS TATOOS SPOILES IT, I LOVE MACGARET AND DANNY TOGETHER.IM NOT BUYING THE MOVIE BECOUSE ITS NOT A FAMILY MOVIE."
2,Nothing Special,"I watched five episodes of this before bailing on it. Other than the scenery, this is run-of-the-mill with paper-thin cliches as characters. A more accurate title would be ""Male Model Five-O""."
2,"Not a review, but....","Let me start off by saying that I love this show. I think the cast has tremendous chemistry and season 2 is looking great so far. Love the addition of Terry O'Quinn. Anyways, about this Season 1 Blu Ray....why is it so hard to get?? The blu ray won't even come up in an Amazon search. You search for Hawaii Five-O and all you get is the DVD. What's the deal? Is it a limited release? Only available out of the country? What the heck?? And they are charging almost $80 from a third party??? The show would receive 5 stars, but because of availability...you get 2."
3,Release this on Blu Ray now!,Great series. Would have given it 5 stars if it was released in the proper format. I will wait for the blu ray to buy this.
2,JACK = STEVE,This is NOT havaii 5-0. Jack lord is the real steve macgarett and they should stop give new shows titles which they have nothing to do in reality.
2,"I tried to love it, really I did","I loved Moonlight and Alex O'Loughlin, and I think Grace Park and Daniel Dae Kim are hot. But since the beginning I thought the script was really poorly written and amateurish and the characters were unconvincing. But I stuck with it... till today. I had to turn off the TV in the middle of the show because I simply couldn't take the whiny over-acting of Scott Caan anymore. He may get away with it if he's good looking, but he's short, has bad hair and bad posture and zero charisma. So bye-bye Hawaii."
1,No Blu-Ray?,"Reviewed @ 1 star because like everyone else who has posted, waiting on blu-ray release, otherwise what's the point?Regarding the series, I remember the old series and used to watch with my grandparents, this reboot is an awesome update to this franchise. Hey CBS, just give us blu-ray and I'll forgive your shortsightness."
5,Five O Again!,"No, this isn't the original show. If you compare the two and you are looking for the newer version to be a duplicate of the original show, you may be disappointed.However, if you try to enjoy the new Five-O as a completely new show (with some similarities to the original), it's one of the most exciting new shows out there (IMHO) - along with Blue Bloods.The scenery is great (plenty of nice shots of Hawaii, the cast works well together. I enjoy the banter between Danny and Steve. The plots have mostly been excellent and well executed. Looking forward to the DVD release of this new show."
5,Fantastic images in a good TV show!!!,"Very good images of Hawaii locations, a team fo actors that holds the attention on amazing plots, all this in Blu-Ray.Outstanding!!!"
5,Hawaii Five-O : Season 1 : Good to watch!,"This is my first time buying a DVD and first time buying it online from a US website. Delivery as well ahead of time and packaging was good. DVD is in perfect condition and quality of movie very good. Basically this season is action packed, love the actors and scenes of beautiful Hawaii. Keep up the good work !"
5,Hawaii 5 0,I received my copy of Hawaii 5 0 Season one within one week (5 days I think) of ordering. It was in perfect condition. I started watching the show in season two so I have enjoyed catching up on how things started with 5 0. I would order from this vender again.
2,Sometimes you can't redo a classic without ruining it!,"The only thing I like is the intro, because it pays homage to the original series, which simply can never be duplicated! The new cast, well... O'Laughlin and Caan seem like towel snapping frat boys, or some dudes I knew back in high school! How can they be taken seriously???? I kind of like Grace Park I guess, because I'm a guy, but I need a little more incentive than just that to keep me watching."
2,Huge disappointment,OMG what a letdownincredibly boring and simple-mindedterrible acting and writingI stopped at ep. five....Buy Mentalist 3 instead! (or even Castle 3)
1,Blu-ray version,I am shocked a blu-ray version is not being offered. This show is so visually stunning that to release it as a DVD only release does not play to it's strengths. I will wait for a blu-ray release.
5,Very intertaining.,"I did not know if I would like this series or not, but I love it. I am learning Hawaiian as I go since each episode has a Hawaiian title as well as the English. I like the cast. Daniel is great in his part as well as the other actors."
5,Love it,"Wasn't available in my country for a couple of months later, so even with waiting for it to arrive was faster than I could buy it in Australia."
3,"Love the show, but this review is for the DVD quality","The quality of the DVDs are poor. Disc 1 and Disc 4 skip badly during play...close inspection reveals underlying scratches and dimples. Also, on Disc 1 and 3, unable to watch the Deleted Scenes part."
4,Five-0 : Next Generation,"Top notch cast,writers and of course it takes place in Hawaii...From the first epi to the last,you were kept on the edge of your seat...I'm sure it will be a long ride,so hop on board..."
3,Case was broken,I love this show. Best new show on tv. But when I this collection the case busted. I have to get another case for it. I was not happy.
4,ive conducted the show...,"having conducted this show in a recent mississippi production, i learned that this is the version that Williamson Music sends with the production package. This score is, in essence, the conductor's score - including cues. if you are interested in producing this show, this is the pre-usual score to purchase."
2,TOO OLD TO BE SOLD,"I have been in love with Estee Lauder's original Youth Dew fragrance since the 1960's. When I heard about the Youth Dew Amber Nude fragrance I decided to try it. After trying to buy this product in several department stores, I was advised that it's an 'old' product that had been removed from their stock. Evidentally it didn't sell well because the original Youth Dew fragrance is still in stock. When I saw that the Amber Nude was available on Amazon.com, I jumped at the chance to buy it. Bad idea! It smelled ""old"", as some fragrances do when they've been around too long. I was sorry that I ordered it."
2,Collector's piece...,"The 1956 first edition of this book was the first English-language book with Aikido EVER (before Ueshiba, before Tohei). About 40% of this book is devoted to Aikido (pretty basic stuff). The earliest printings carried the title ""Judo: Appendix Aikido"". It's not for the person wanting to learn Aikido; just for the book collector."
5,Essential Information for All Visual Artists,"How human visual perception works may seem intuitive or obvious to artists--but you would be wise to study this book and realize that it's much more complex, subtle, and amazing than you think. Livingstone lays it out with great illustrations and very readable explanations of complicated cell-level processes. Then she goes on to show how great artists have applied these principles to their work. She answers many questions regarding the mechanisms which make great art so evocative.If you want to be a good artist, or understand what's happening when we appreciate art, get this book."
4,Too short,"This is a nice mattress, however it is actually 15 x 31 1/2 instead of 15 x 33. When I put it in our cradle and saw that it was too short (you can see about an inch of the cradle bottom on both ends) I measured it with a tape measure. I tried to contact the company to see if this one was a mistake, I was told that they are standard size and asked ""was I sure that it was too short?"". Like they thought I couldn't see the bottom of the cradle and that I couldn't read a tape measure. I will still use the mattress but I have to put a rolled up cradle sheet at the end of it."
5,cradle mattress,Just what we wanted. It fit perfectly in the family cradle. We had been concerned we coud not use the cradle for the upcoming birth as we had not found a mattress for it. I am so glad we did as now the baby can sleep in the same cradle as daddy did.
5,Wonderful!,When i ordered this mattress I was in a hurry because I couldn't find one anywhere else and my son was coming home from the nicu in just a few days. I got the mattress a lot sooner than I expected and it was exactly what I was looking for.
2,Not quite the size they claim!,"I think the actual size is like 14 x 31 or something like that I was very dissappointed, but I am using it any way. It still works just not as well as I would have liked is all!"
5,Best CD of Janis' music,Not only including her hits but also her earlier recordings and lets us hear the range & depth of this outstanding singer. Highly recommend this boxed set. May still be some copies out there so for a Janis fan it is a MUST!
3,"""What Happened""?","After hearing and loving the great hit ""Ball and Chain"" with Janis along with Big Brother and the Holding Company and seeing that this song was included in this set I jumped at the chance to buy it used. What a disappointment,the version that I listened to for 30+ years was not even the one that was on this set. The one that was included was not near as haunting as the original,what a disappointment. There is some good material here but there is also some out takes that could of been replaced with more positive recordings. If I had it to do over I would of been more selective before making this $30.00 mistake!"
5,Awesome,"She's the most influential and aspring woman singer of any generation. Her name and her legend will live within anyone who-like me-gets chills whenever her soul spills onto the floor, in each and every one of her ballads"
4,The Rose,"I became interested in Janis Joplin after seeing the movie The Rose. I was just captivated by the power in her voice. I had the soundtrack from a documentary of her life. It was great. There were interviews & other snippets from and about her on the album. But being young, I didn't appreciate what I had. My friends & family made fun of me for liking this white singer, so I gave in to peer pressure & gave the album away. I've regretted that decision ever since, and have been searching everywhere for a CD version of the soundtrack. This is the closest I've found so far.****YOUNG PEOPLE! NEVER GIVE AWAY YOUR MUSIC OR BOOKS! YOU'LL REGRET IT WHEN YOU'RE OLDER!****"
4,it's Great!!,"I just bought this box set at Spec's for $52. This is a great album there's lots of unreleased songs and it has music from Big Brother and the Holding Company, Kozmic Blues,and Full Tilt. This box set also has clips of Janis Joplin in the studio talking before recordings. You will be very satisfied with this album."
3,Digital monitor is misleading,"The digital monitor simply counts the back-n-forth movement of the seat.It's not connected to the fly-wheel at all. So the calorie count ismeaningless - the monitor doesn't even know the flywheel resistance levelyou're using. I don't really care about it that much, but it would havebeen nice to be told of this beforehand. I realized it just because thewire from the monitor only went backwards, towards the seat. If you standup from the seat and row, the monitor stays blank. If you leave the rowingbar alone and just push the seat back-n-forth with your hand, the monitorshows plenty of activity!The machine has three supports, but the middle support is actually slightlyoff the ground. Not sure if that's intentional. The middle support bearsweight only when the machine is folded up.Anyway, the machine looks fine for light use. For heavy-duty use, youprobably need something sturdier."
5,Great Rowing Machine,"I have owned three rowing machines. This one is by far the best one yet and it cost $100 less than the one I purchased in 1993. This machine gives you a good workout and unlike my other machines, the tension is adjustable so you can work as hard or easy as you like."
3,Good but not enough resistance,"I bought this rower and put it together with no problem. It came in two boxes, clear instructions and the material seemed sturdy. I had no trouble with the display. It worked properly. I liked the machine at first and only bought it because the rower at my old gym was one of my favorite pieces of equipment to use. I expected to get a full body workout with this like at the gym but it just doesn't offer enough resistance. It's just too easy. Also the recoil isn't executed properly because the pulling mechanism for the machine is a nylon strap. It can give a jerking or stumble feel when you're trying to do double time or isolate the obliques. It seems to be even easier for smaller people. I let my friend and my mom try it on separate instances. They're both 5'3 and both said they didn't even feel a workout, even on the highest setting. I ended up selling the unit."
3,Rowing machine primarily for my wife,"THe machine seems generally well made and i bought it primarily for my wife who is using it. Two things I don't like personally: the digital readout never really turns off, there is no switch, and the battery life will be lessened; Point two is that even the stiffest setting will not challenge fit people and they might want to consider a more challenging machine. It also takes up a large horizontal space and since folding it is not much fun, it will have to stay in the middle of the floor most of the time. I can fold it but shee will not."
2,Many minor glitches,"Both foot straps (ridiculously inferior quality) broke immediately. The electronic timer has not worked - sometimes it's on, sometimes it's off. The bottom of the ""heel holder"" on the foot rests is too shallow - my feet keep slipping out. With my new straps (bought at Dick's), I cinch my feet very tightly into the foot rests and they do not slip out. I use the rower for 25 minutes each morning. Fundamentally, the rower works very smoothly and gives a decent, low-grade workout. I hope that the mechanics of the rower work better and last longer than the three largely ancillary parts that I identified above."
3,"Fine machine, but flawed","I've had this machine for a few weeks and used it daily. My largest complaint is the front of the machine will actually lift up and slam down with every row unless the handlebar is pulled almost perfectly horizontal from the machine. I'm 5'8"" and the 'natural' row for me is at a slight angle which causes this lift. This lifting motion, along with the flat bottomed floor supports also causes the machine to move across the floor as you row. I plan on trying to secure the machine to the floor with dumbells, but wish the machine was simply weighted properly to begin with."
2,Poorly Built,"I have owned this machine for 2 years now and have used sporatically during that time. I have recently started a workout program where I am using now daily. The problem is the machine is literally falling apart. First the foot straps have broken numerous times. The pull strap has frayed so I call to get a new strap and was told I need to buy the entire recoil system for 366 dollars, I only paid 460 for the entire machine. If you want a machine to impress your friends and not use this is it. NOT WORTH THE MONEY!!!"
2,This is NOT for serious workouts,"I decided on this machine to replace my worn out Kettler Coach, based on its cost and positive reviews. After receiving it yesterday, it took about a half hour to assemble. The first issue I ran into was the display panel wouldn't work. It would activate at the start of the workout, but the readouts would remain at zero until it shut down after ten minutes. Pulling the display out and replacing the batteries worked for a while, but then it shuts off again even while using the machine.As to the workout. Even at the highest setting, 5, there's very little resistance. After a half hour I never even broke a sweat; I'm 62 and exercise regularly, but I'm no athlete. I expected, however, at least a semi-rigorous cardio for calorie burn, but this just won't do it. Very disappointing. If you're serious about your workouts, look elsewhere.The biggest physical challenge with this machine will be re-boxing and returning it."
4,Roachmine,"This CD'S ok. Worth the price since you get 2. If you like them, there last 2 CD'S are better. Saturation is their best (my opinion)."
4,good watch,"i got this watch for my dad. the gift package came in the authentic bulova box, tissue paper and a gift bag. it's just that the watch band was a little too bright brown for me... i wanted a rich dark brown band."
1,do not buy!,It broken 5 months after first use...no way to contact company to be repaired.amazon should not sell those kind of items.very unpleased!
2,Waste of money,You can get most of the information in this book FREE from the WEB or in any quality swingers mag. The use of the word UTLIMATE is a JOKE. Very basic but a short read.
3,Common Sense,Basically this book would appeal to lonely guys who couldn't get a date never mind have a swinging lifestyle but it is useful for a couple who are honestly and sincerely looking to have a meaningful relationship. Swinging is about honesty and experiencing love and sex without jeaolusy and becoming a complete person.
2,Quality ?,"This flag is very low quality, emblem is printed on one side only and shows through opposite side backwards. If you want a navy jack get a heavy material with sewn on emblems."
4,very enjoyable medievel...,"this book is a sequel of sorts to the author's Bride of Windermere. But I haven't read that one first and still found Dryden's Bride enjoyable on it's own merit. The book has all the elements of classic Medievel romance-tortured hero, downtrodden but spunky heroine, truly evil villian. The theme of the book is how the two main characters have a flawed sense on how others perceive and value them. Having the love of the other opens their eyes that they are truly worthy and worthy of love and family.While I understand another's reviewers comment about historical accuracy-I do feel that this IS a work of fiction, a romance, and therefore the author should be given a little leeway about historical accuracy. It's supposed to be entertainment, light reading-don't overanalyze it folks:)Great escapist weekend reading-4 stars****"
2,Genuine Reality is a Genuinely Mediocre Biography,I finished this book last week and frankly I couldn't wait to put it down -- the author has no feel for the man or his ideas -- it is biography at the most superficial level.
3,"Cool, but not enough energy and perfection....","i am a huge santana fan.In september 2003, i went to see them in concart as part of the 'shamen' tour.They were absoulutley amazing.By that sort of time i knew what santanas stuff waz like, so when i bort borboletta, for 7.99 i fort it was like v over albums i had of them eg.Supernatural, shamen(ov course),Abraxas,and live wit buddy Miles...wen i hard it i knew vere woz something wrong.But then when i listned to v whole album again,and began to appreciate the muzic a bit more.I knew vat carlos woz just experimenting with different types of music arond that sport of time...its actually really cool...bye!"
2,for lite jazz fans,"This aint Santana at all. There might be fans of this phase of Santana, but I am not one of them. Santana to me is Latin rock, not this fluff. Glad I only paid $4.99 for it."
4,Santana at his best. Great chops,"This is latin jazz influenced rock at its best. Sometimes when Santana has tried to be experimental he could get a little tiresome but the music on this record gets your attention and never lets up. This album which weaves thru various moods and is alternately serene, funky and always interesting. The work of percussionist Airto is brilliant. Santana's chops are terrific and he's especially inspired on the album's climax cut, ""Song of the Fisherman"". Overall this is a highly successful and wonderful album. Four Stars!"
5,1 Stinkin' Star for Amazon.com - Borboletta is Fantastic But This is NOT a Remaster or 2008 Release,"Borboletta is by far my favorite Santana release. I can't give this less that 5 stars... However, Amazon gets 1 stinkin' star. When I saw the 2008 date on this posting I assumed that Sony had finally gotten around to a remaster, after all, Welcome was remastered in 2003. NOT. This is the same ol' AAD release that I already had that's been around since forever. Not the first time I've been burned by Amazon on CDs."
2,Disappointed!,"I was disappointed when this CD arrived, listed as a 2008 release, only to find that it was identical to the same release as the very ordinary early CD remaster of ""Borboletta"", in other words nothing at all contemporary, neither newly remastered or even packaged with any information other than title details. Amazon needs to do more to inform shoppers of the exact product being sold."
3,The end of Santana's jazz fusion era.,"The last of Santana's jazz fusion albums, Borboletta is really a mediocre album. Too many of the songs are boring, and Leon Patillo isn't really the best singer. The instrumental montage at the end, Here and Now, Flor de Canela, and Promise of a Fisherman are really the only great songs on the album, with the exception of one or two others.It was about time for Santana to return to it's latin roots. Only Canto de las Flores shows a hint of latin sound.It's also good to hear David Brown on bass agaim. He would even stick around for the following album, Amigos.Chepito Areas's timbales only appear on one song, and Michael Shrieve would leave the band for good after the album was released. He was responsible for at least 60% of Santana's sound. Without him, Santana would never again sound the same as the glory days.If you like jazz fusion, you might want to get this album. But if you want to listen to the afro-cuban/rock Santana, grab the following album, Amigos."
3,Santana Borboletta-overrated?,"I really believe that this review 'panel' is a bit worked up over this album. I have over 25 Santana albums in my music collection and I would have to say this album recieves the least airtime. Many of the reviewers find the last few tracks on Borboletta meditative which I find surprising given the harsh almost over-blown tone of the saxophone.These last tracks are pretty much saxophone solos and I find them so 'disturbing' that I usually skip them.There is one song on this album that I think should be on a Greatest Hits album ; that being 'One With The Sun'.As it has some nice singing by Leon Patillo and some nice guitar from Santana.Other pieces that I rate up there ,include Practise What You Preach and Mirage."
3,Not a bad Santana Album,"I loved the first 3 Santana albums plus a few other things he has done, but this one needs time to grow on you. After some time I am changing my review on this CD and give it a better review.It's a jazzy album that has some great moments."
2,Conscious move toward commercialism,"When Santana decided to abandon fusion in order to sell more records, this was the product - a hodge-podge album, with some really awful R&B; tracks - ""moorage???"" and some great instrumental pieces, that to me, define the Santana sound of the period.So you get an inconsistent, weak album overall, although not without some great music on it.Far from being washed up, Santana put out some very good and very commercial albums later, such as Amigos and Moonflower, and a solid return to fusion with The Swing of Delight. After that, it was the same hit-or-miss for a few decades, until his total artistic self-sacrifice with Supernatural, in 2000. Oh well, I console myself with the thought that we still have the classic albums to enjoy. Viva Santana Classico!"
5,"No, listen to ME instead.","GAWD, HOW BEAUTIFUL. Yes, the lyrics are a bit goofy. But only jerks obsess about lyrics. Shut your mouth and listen. Let's mention here also the gorgeous track ""Friendship"" with McLaughlin on the ""Johnny McLaughlin, Electric guitarist"" disc. Lyrical. moving, profound and exquisite. Don't like McLaughlin? Then go stick your head in a bucket of rancid chicken fat."
4,For the Santana fans,"I just recently discovered this, and it is a pleasure. While not as impressive as the first album, Caravanserai, and Supernatural it is certainly worth the money and time."
5,pleased,Item came within the specified time alottment and was well packaged against damaging-would reccomend this seller!
2,"Disappointing, a lame version of Sly & the Family Stone","I'm a big fan of Santana, especially his more experimental stuff, and have seen him play live many times over the years. I was hoping Borboletta would be something like Caravanserai but it's not even close. Borboletta is full of very weak r&b type songs that are poorly written and dully executed. And on top of that, THERE'S NOT MUCH GUITAR PLAYING!!! By contrast, I think Caravanserai is one of the greatest albums ever recorded so I was very surprised at the wide gap in quality between these two albums that were done only a few years apart. I think there were substantial changes in band personnel (i.e., Gregg Rollie and Neal Schon departing, among others) and that probably did not help. Stick with Caravanserai, Lotus and Moonflower."
2,The beginning of the downslide,"My review title basically sums it up. Santana, both the individual and the band, has never been the same since...irregardless how many albums he's sold."
4,Tales of a Korean Grandmother,This book has good stories and give a interesting look into the life of Korean family before modernize of the country.
2,Not the best cop book on the market...,"The glimpses into cop work are brief, over-dramatized, and lacking the emotional power of other works by authors such as Gina Gallo. It is a sincere attempt to reveal the inner workings of NYPD but the author fails to achieve this. I found myself losing interest after chapter 2, which is a shame, because the subject is an ever-engrossing one."
4,Hello Stanny,"Thats right. Hello Stanny You feel like you are a part ofStanford White's world When you read this book ...For me, It waslike I could step right into Stanford's world. His electric personality enveloped me as I flew through the pages. I went to Europe with 'Stanny' I visited Milan of the 1880's I toured the streets of New York sidstepping the carriages. Before New York was 42nd street and taxis, New york belonged to the opulence of a century gone by. You too can live in Stannys world if you read this book.Follow him through into his fifties when finally he is shot by his jealous lovers husband in the Madison Square Garden he designed.Good summer reading, delightful pros and excellent narrative. Never a dull moment. This book is good beach reading. Take my advice and take Stanny home with you from Amazon today ..."
2,Don't waste you money,"dnt waste your money on this design. it just fades wid time. besides even if the lighter gets moist from outside, the design starts peeling off."
5,I love it,"It's a real zippo. cool! I wanna give it to my uncle, he must be like it. and it's also very cheap."
4,Nice Lighter,Very nice lighter. The only thing i had wrong with it is that the design on it started rubbing off from taking it out of my pocket and putting it back in. My parents found it and threw it out so i bought a High Polish Chrome Zippo now.
3,How to put your name on it?,I see the previous review saying that you can creat your own name or ID on the lighter but I don't see any box or note allowing me to do it? Someone know how to or I misunderstand?
5,Happy Customer.,"I am very happy with the book. as a sufferer of CBT,It helped me to understand more about cognitive behavioral therapy.To me the book does exactly what it say's on the cover,change how you feel by changing the way you think."
3,MIND OVER MOOD,"COMMON SENSE TOPIC AND CONTENT. NOT AS EASY TO DO IN REAL LIFE, ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE SUFFERING FROM DEPRESSION."
4,A systematic way to change our emotional patterns,"This is a very operable book giving detail steps to see clearly what is behind our emotions, how we get there, and how we can change to a more balanced, and realistic view so that our emotion can be uplifting."
5,Good book if you actually do the work,"This workbook helped to give me insight as to why a person's thought process is the way it is. If you are willing to answer the questions honestly and do the pages, this will be beneficial in helping you figure out your own cognitive thought process."
2,A Waste of Time!,This book continuously insults the reader's intelligence. It describes situations and terms in such painfully obvious ways and then repeats them several times so the reader will remember them. I spent half my time flipping past pages upon pages of repeated text until I just couldn't take it anymore and I closed the book forever.
3,Lovely and quiet,But illustrations a little too monotonous to hold a 3 year old boy's attention. Pretty good for a bedtime book.
4,Excellent for the beginner to intermediate do-it-yourselfer.,"Our landlord left an old (1930s) Linden wood table in the basement. Linden wood is very soft and pale. The table had lost the veneer top well before we met it. Mr. Jewitt took us through the preparation stages, helped us decide what type of wood color to use (water-based dye), finishing method, and how to apply a hand-rubbed satin finish. Even if you don't know much about materials or methods, this book is easy to understand and walks you through the process. If you have some basic knowledge, it provides very interesting details on how various finishes cure and why they look different. I'd say that for beginners to intermediate wood-workers, this book is well worth the price. It deserves a front row on the workroom bookshelf."
4,Thought provoking,"It was not a high budget film, but the story was interesting, and held your attention until the end. It will cause you to look at yourself, and consider what you would have done back then."
3,Interesting concept.,"May have been inspired by Jesus' words that even if we, as humans, were to not give testimony to God, the rocks themselves would. My son saw this movie on tv ans was positively affected by the story. He wanted a copy of the movie. It is a storyline that needs some work but could have great potential. As stated in other reviews, the quality of the production was less than polished. Personally, the thing I had the hardest time with was the 'forced' acting and script glitches. If someone could work on the script and make it more natural with a reasonable flow, then the message would be more powerful. It's just that the characters would have 'reactions' or conjectures that were forceful and random that distracted from the continuity or point of the story."
1,Please Put Forth Better Effort Next Time,"The message of the sacrifice made for all humanity by the Son of God should be held as sacred. I believe that the makers of this film had good and honorable intentions however the execution of the final product was simply put: horrible. The acting, sound, and terrible camera work made this film very difficult to watch and very distracting to the important message we all must hear, the gospel. I must apologize for such a critical review as the concept had intregue and I think the actors and producers hearts were in the right place. ""Christian"" movies are fine but I believe that Christian movie makers should excell in their craft to present the gospel in the best possible light. This may seem shallow but it is a reality that often the message is judged by the presentation. See a film like ""The Last Sin Eater"" to see how it should be done."
1,no thinking allowed,"This movie is one of the worst I've seen, in terms of acting, script, and concept. Obviously, it's a christian propaganda film, where they mock science, scientists and the scientific establishment, where thinking is not allowed."
4,AAA-Aid,"When it comes to electronics today, we need all different kinds of batteries for our MP3 Players and extra needs for our homes. Maxell knows that feeling with making some of the highest-quality aids for our electonics. This 20 pack of AAA alkaline batteries is convient and works just as well as other brands like Energizer and Duracell. It is convient and delivers well for all your needs. I've bought batteries from Maxell before and they last just as strong. I really recommend this multi-pack for all your flashlights, remote controls, and anything else that you depend on to help you through your gadgets' lives.Price: BConvience: B+Overall: B 1/2+"
2,Bad Battaries,"They do not last very long. They go dead very fast. They are being usedx in calculators, CD players and MP3 players."
3,Not enough tests yet,"I would change this review as soon as I can test more batteries from the pack, but the first ones that I used to different simple appliances, show me an original charge of 70%."
1,"bad batteries,,,",doesnt last but a hour if i am lucky they last an hour..like they are DEAD at tme of purchase wish i could change products
4,So-So,"For the price, these batteries are perfect. it is much cheaper to buy these than other batteries that last only a little while longer."
1,shipping is fifteen dlrs ??,what kind of incompetent merchants would sell something for three bucks and slap a ridiculous shipping charge on that
1,Not Sturdy Enough,"If you have a dog that likes to chew like ours, the bone on top was chewed through the first time we gave it to her so a reg frisbee holds up much better"
1,not what we wanted,"nylabone makes flexible frisbees - this is not one. hard plastic. great for playing, but not for our dog. recommend for everything but."
4,holds up well... be sure its the right version,"my Golden Retriever loves to chase/fetch his frisbee, carry it around and yes, chew on it. The first one of these held up for 3 years. The second time I got the one with the bone on top and that was gone in a week. Then got the flexible version which looks just like this one... but it was gone in 2 weeks. After looking carefully at the Nylabone site, I figured out there are several versions, got the right one and it held up again for about 3 years. The best lasting one is the Durable(aka Durachew) Nylabone one with the Flat top (listed above). Buying a new one of these now, since the old one has finally gotten too bad to use (rough edges which can hurt his mouth - still flys tho!)"
4,Where's your Frisbee?,"My Dobie is fond of his Frisbee. He always remembers where he left it and will lead me to it if I ask, ""Where's your frisbee?"". It replaces a Kong Frisbee that was reduced to two toys,a frisbee ring n a floppy frisbee in short order. It durable even with his jaws(I have a cat food can my Dobie opened for him self) My complaint is it is to small,he loves to slide on it...is there a snow disc Frisbee? I will give 5 Stars for a bigger one!"
3,Not durable enough...,"We have a 60lb mixed breed who loves to play frisbee, but this one got torn up on the first go round. We can still use it, but it's got teeth marks in it and the side is already torn. Maybe it's better for less ""mouthy"" dogs, but ours is quite the beast. It's also kind of hard for him to pick up since it's flat on the top. The ones with the bone on top seem to be better suited for dogs that don't fetch in the air (our dog likes to chase the frisbee while it rolls and then stomp on it with his paw before grabbing in his mouth)."
3,durable within limits,"Product is durable but a serious chewer can tear it up if left unsupervised. Chewing will leave small bits of hard plastic sticking up from the surface that can make it hard to throw forcefully without gloves. Bottom line: if your dog is a serious chewer, do not leave them alone with this toy."
2,Not strong enough,"I bought one of these, my labrador loved it, the bone on top made it easier to pick up. but the plastic that it was made of was too easy to destroy. With all the time we spent playing she always managed to destroy some part of it. It sould be tougher."
4,Mastering Nikon Compact Digital Cameras,"Using the techniques listed I was able to rediscover photography. I have read 1/3 of the ""book"" and learned new techniques or relearned old concepts long forgotten.Why only 4 stars, this ""book"" should be a book w/cd supplemented by his website...In the preface he explains his reasons for using this format, but I think a traditional book (spiral-bound) would have been better.This leads me back to the content, so far it has been excellent and I'm sure I will get [my money]out of it."
5,All you need to know!,"A concise, well written presentation of ""All you need to know"". The important points are covered in the order you need to see them. You get started quickly, and move rapidly in a detailed but logical manner through the workings of the coolpix line. Required reading if you are serious about learning to get the most from your tools."
2,"Overpriced, and of limited use","This is certainly not worth the price. Of the 458 pages of the book, only 133 are of potential use to me. Trial versions of software are worth very little cost, since anyone can get them with a bit of searching. Someone who uses Photoshop (not Photoshop Elements) might find this of more value, but the filters included do not work with Photoshop Elements. And I don't use PhotoShop due to its high price (so to be fair, chapter 9's 20 pages may turn out to be applicable to the image processing software that I do use).I would certainly not recommend that anyone buy this book without first leafing through it at the bookstore ... What's that? No opportunity to do so, since it's a totally CD book. That makes it worth even less tome.I'd have been happier to pay half or less of the cost of this book, for what it is."
5,Great ebook!,"Thanks M. iNova for writing us this wonderful book. No editors beleived in this project so M. iNova made an ebook instead of a real book. And it's great cause you can see real digital pictures and 300 Photoshop filters are included and many examples to work with. This is a must have for all Nikon Coolpix 990 owners. We're very lucky to have a book on digital photo specific on our camera. It's not just a user guide, it's a digital photo lesson for YOUR camera."
5,A Great comedy of murder !,"This one is surely one of the most entertaining Fell mystery.It is a memorable mix between a hilarous comedy set on a ship and a good whodunit. Here,there is no locked-room,but very funny situations.But be careful,most of the clues are hidden in the comic parts.Only few mysteries mix with such talent humour and mystery.Dont miss this one."
3,Electric Scotto,"I like much of Scotto's artistry, but this is just not her cup of tea. Her high notes sound like they are plugged into an electric socket! AHHHHH!!!... Even her usual, wonderful word painting is not there. Her Vien's at the end of the garden scene are worse than the most mushy mouthed Sutherland (who could at least produce beautiful sounds). Get the Sony arias disc with Renata Scotto, which, oddly enough, shows her in much better and firmer voice, even though it was recorded later.Ghiaurov is magnificent, as always and Kraus provides more elegant support than many of his later recordings.If you want a verismo-like performance, get the recording with Freni (awesome......the largest voiced Margie on record). Domingo is dramatic, beautiful, if without a great high C. The final trio is SO dramatic. Hmmmm, what to buy?"
5,20th Century Art Shines !,"This art book is the most complete description, most detailed analysis, most distinguished book of its kind. It has almost every painter of the twentieth century (and some impressionists of the 19th as well) with his/her's most important works and some not so very well known that show the great variety some painters have. This book is full of color photographs of painters (book 1) and of sculptors (book 2). You've never seen Picasso, Pollock, Kline, Lissitsky, Moholy - Nagy, Dali, Vasarely, and hundreds of other so well before ! At the very end of the second book you have a short biography of EACH AND EVERYONE of the painters and sculptors in the book. This is THE MUST BOOK for every art lover in the world."
3,Decent history of 20TH Century Art,"I have several art history textbooks that I had to read for school. I generally like Taschen's books because they are attractive and inexpensive. This book is pretty good, it doesn't put you to sleep when you read it like most books like this. Most books that try to cover painting, sculpture, photography and film over a 100 years or so can be very dry. I would reccommend this book over H.H. Arnason's book that I had to read at the Art Inst. of Chicago. I would recommend this book with Stokstad's Art History text. Stokstad taught a friend of mine at Kansas and I found her book to be a good reference. This book, I think, is written by a European...so, it might be good to have an American and European's view of the same subjects."
3,Not what the Amazon.com review says it is.,"This is far from the ""be-all, end-all guide to art of the past 100 years."" In fact, while it does cover a huge number of artists superficially, it leaves out an equally huge number of extremely important 20th century artists, particularly 3-dimensional artists. Where is Ernest Trova? Claude & Francois Lalanne? Chihuly? Where, in God's name, is Duane Hanson, the first and best 3-dimensional Hyperrealist? If you want a superficial and not particularly daring look at 20th century art, this is a decent choice. It is not, however, anything approaching ""be-all"" or ""end-all."""
1,MADE IN MALAYSIA & PRINTED CROOKED,"I am very disappointed in this product. Amazon's website CLEARLY STATES made in England, and these bowls are made in Malaysia. FALSE ADVERTISING. Furthermore, most of the design on the bowls is evidently crooked. As I am buying these bowls for everyday use and not for a collection, the fact that they're made in Malaysia wouldn't be so bad if the design wasn't crooked. I am giving the bowls one star because the color is actually quite beautiful. BUYER BEWARE."
5,"My Review of ""With Malice Toward Some""","""With Malice Toward Some"" by Georgia Z Post is a most unusual book of short stories. There are 47 short stories in this book all of which are amazing. I thoroughly enjoyed each story. The author has amazing writing skill for humorous stories and she presents them well.I came across this book at a book signing at the Tarpon Springs, Florida Library. The signing was put on by the writing group which meets at the Library one day a week.I was able to meet the author and purchase her book. She has an amazing personality and it shows in her stories. This book is one that should be left on a coffee table in your home to pick up at random and enjoy. I feel it should also be placed in the waiting rooms of doctors offices.""With Malice Toward Some"" by Georgia Z Post is a great book and I highly recommend it."
3,Nice Stereo But Audio Quality Leaves Something to Be Desired,Just picked this shelf stereo up as a gift for someone. After setting up the stereo and testing it here is what I think. First off its very nicely designed visually speaking. Speakers are a bit thinner then what I expected though. Sound quality on this shelf system isn't the greatest. The higher you go with the volume the more distortion you will hear. The preset equalizer functions just make it sound worse...I found it just best to turn on super sound. Overall I would say this is a good system for a small room if you don't expect to really turn up the sound. Again in cd mode (which is the best sound you will get) music sounded distorted the higher the volume went (past 50%). Tape deck didn't have an option for metal tapes (Co2 i believe) not sure if thats built in or not...quality on tape playback was pretty poor.Stereo does pack nice features such as a mp3 & digital buttons on tape deck...it also looks very sharp for the price.
1,Report Wedge,"Buyers be aware that the picture does not show the correct shoe. The real shoe has an ankle strap. Also, the shoe seemed to run a half size smaller. I had to return the shoe and lose out on shipping costs."
3,Wood portions chips easily,"I bought these shoes for my daughter ...because she just had to have them....last Christmas. They are darling, all leather uppers and the heel (which is really high to me..but what do I know) is wrapped in leather. The part where your foot goes in is wood and chips pretty easily. We ended up using a furnisher wood marker to cover it up. Kind of a bummer since they cost around $80.00. They are very cute you just have to be careful going up stairs, curbs etc.."
1,shoes,The picture of the shoes was deceiving. Did not want ankle strap. You could notgo by the picture. Which is how you do online shopping. Returned the shoes.
3,Has good web sites,"Some of the book is hard to understand, if you know nothing about computers. Some of the websites no longer exist. For the most part i have found 2 really good sites and i think they have made the book worth my money"
2,I've seen better,"This book isn't nearly as good as a similar book, called Homeschool Your Child for Free (Gold/Zielinski), which is very well organized, easy to use, and includes a recommended scope and sequence that ties it all together. I am a big reader of homeschooling books, and this Guide to the Internet doesn't come close to the quality of Homeschool Your Child for Free."
3,REAR SEAT!!,I am giving this product 3 stars only because the quality seemed good. But please be aware that this is for the REAR SEAT no the front seat as pictured. It does not say this anywhere in the description (unless they add it after my review). Had to return and will search for a front seat cover.
5,"Paul Mauriat, Definitive collection","This is an excellent collection, if you're a Paul Mauriat fan, which I am. It is also the second of this same collection that I have purchased. Those of you who have, or have had, young Black Labs will understand."
3,Paul Mauriat Definitive Collection CD,"I bought this CD because because I'd like to have a copy of the original composition of La Chanson Pour Anna (Song for Anna)by Paul Mauriat, but it came out just another version. I was disappointed."
5,Rich baritone stylings,"Henri Salvador has the kind of voice not often heard today with its rich baritone and elegance nuances. His choice of program is always varied and well chosen with both sultry ballads and more uptempo numbers. The orchestrations are always first-rate and compliment his singing rather than overpower it. If you enjoy the qualities of ""nostalgia"" blended with excellent musicianship you will not be disappointed. He has the touch of the old school in that this is music to savor and luxuriate in.Thomas Lee Randleman"
3,Everything OK but three problems,"I just received the Canon HV10 today. The first problem was simple. The remote device battery pocket refused to open. I tried in every way to open it to insert the battery with no luck. I called Canon and the lady there said yes it was very difficult as she had similar complaints. I finally opened it scaring the plastic case with a sharp knife. Second was the manual. Poorly written and too small for these old eyes. I will have to download it as aPDF file and print it in larger type. The third problem is that there were four very noticable white spots and four black spots on the picture when projected on my 61"" screen. I called Canon again. The tech man said look at the LCD screen on the camera to see if they were there and indeed they were so back the camera goes. Other than that the pictures even at 61"" were good HD."
4,Generally a good camera but why miniDV?,Generally a good camera but why miniDV? I had to switch to HD based rather then winding through tapes
1,"Poor Interlacing, worst low light camera","This Canon camera has poor quality interlacing artifacts all though out, on a 1080p monitor. I have used other HDV format cameras, and they were much better. The low light level recording was filled with fairly large digital grain. If you use a 1080i tube then it will probably look ok in high light, but still plauged in low light."
4,Nice Camcorder...but,"I really like this camcorder a lot,but the battery really stinks. The size of the Canon HV10 is small enough to put inside your coat pocket or your handbag, backpack etc. The HV10 could be too small to handle for people who got big hands. The picture is excellent though I haven't shot in low light condition yet. Overall I will give the HV10 4 stars because of the battery, if it wasn't for the battery then it would have gotten 5 stars."
4,best camcorder ever !,"i like the camcorder , it has a great picture and an amazing quality .i didnt like the still capture alot , it is better than sony RS300 , as it takes a huge number of still photos and it has a great sequence option . but the still photo quality isnt the best .also the battery life is very weak , when recording on high definition video it has a maximum of 1 hour .it is the best on its price categorey ."
4,Beautiful outdoor video but grainy indoor.,"With all the light on in our house (not that we have the best lighting), our video comes out grainy. Disclaimer... I may need to read the manual thoroughly to discover if there is something more I should be doing to improve the quality.We selected this type of camera so it would be compatible with our Mac, but I really don't like having to do the tape thing again. It Takes longer than real-time to download to our computer. E.g. 30 min of video takes 40 min or so to download."
3,Difficult to download video,no customer support for HD download from cassette for HD software and 1934 firewire to computer interface. Stills work great.
4,A great addition to your Pesach library,This book is wonderful -- full of useful information for kids and adults alike. Both novices and know-it-alls will find something new here. We plan to incorporate some of this material into our family seders this year.
5,A best buy for the Pesach kid's table!,I've bought the other kids' catalogs from JPS but this one is the most useful yet! I purchased one for my children and for the families of their friends who are invited to Pesach dinner. It has lots of great activities and learning tidbits perfect for active children.
3,Radio and the Meatmen,"This release contains all the songs off their first LP and crippled children EP.Meatmen were the most profane punk band to surface from the earliest 80's.The Band was notorious for using explicit language and adult themes expressed by their music.The music is raw and fast, but the studio releases lacked good quality sound. Still this beats listening to mainstream radio anyday."
2,Didn't care for it,"Nothing new here, lots of talk very little instruction. No new ways ofteaching and no basics, just assumming you know"
3,search for meaning,This book meant a lot to me as a number of churches are facing exactly this problem. I found it to be very true of the midwestern churches and the prople quite representative. I would have liked more conversation from the people involved but Mr. Grant certainly presented a variety of efforts by hurting people to find meaning in their lives. Perhaps this will start or encourage lay discussion of this problem
5,"Dan's best ever, as well as my 'first'","Dan Fogelberg reached a magic peak with this album. All the songs on it are timeless, as my grooves are well worn on my copy (yep, still got the album). He has done some great things since this one, however this album still has a place in my heart.The songs on this span a variety of styles, however all have a lot of emotion attached to them (similar to Jackson Browne's 'Late for the Sky'). This was Dan's moment, and he took it to the nth degree....I love this album to this day, and think that anyone who might like this kind of thing would love it too!!!"
5,My favorite....,"This one is my favorite Fogelberg album, along with ""Home Free"" which I find to be a close second.These were the songs he was playing way, way back when I saw him live.Dan Fogelberg was a consummate musician and songwriter, and a gentleman on stage( when he played the show I went to there couldn't have been more than 300-400 of us total in that arena but he was gracious all the same--had us all crowd up close to the stage and then he played two sets--one solo and then one with his backing band Fool's Gold).RIP Dan, and God bless."
4,Only one bad song,"""(Someone's Been) Telling You Stories"" is - in my opinion - one of the very few weak songs that Dan Fogelberg has written over the years. But apart from that, the songs on the rest of the album are either great or very good. His greatest albums, however, are ""Nether Lands"", ""Phoenix"", and ""The Innocent Age""."
5,Souvenirs,I used to walk to this cassette. So wonderful to be able to listen to it on a cd now. I love Dan's music. He will be missed!!!
5,Intelligent money management for kids,"This book contains great suggestions on how to teach your kids (and you!) money management skills from an early age. Both my 9 and 6 year old boys enjoy doing their chores, crossing them off, then budgeting their allowance money into 4 jars each week. My older boy has always been a saver/hoarder; I think this will help him realize it is o.k. to spend some money on himself (medium-term savings). My younger boy is the spender, and this will teach him to save (long-term savings). They pay for a school lunch each week (short-term expenses) and contribute to a charity. It does take some work on the parent's part: setting up meaningful chores each week and staying on top of paying the allowance money, but it's an extremely valuable lesson for the kids."
4,Good book for all parents.,If your a parent and having trouble teaching your children about economy then this is the book for you. It help me with my children very much. This book has many was to help you teach your children and may even teach you a thing or two. So if you need help then get this book.
4,Nice cultural history,"I was never a big fan and I'm still not, but this well written bio seems to do full justice to its mythic subject. You don't hear Joplin much these days. Her voice is so over the top and she only managed to eke out three albums before she od'd on junk, so there isn't that much to hear. She didn't make it past 27, and it's no wonder, according to this account. She was either drunk or high most of the time. She didn't fit in in Port Arthur, Tx., but she did more than most of her generation ever managed. Bisexual and straight, Janis was a mess. You wonder where she'd be today if she'd lived. Of course, she'd never have been a misfit if she had been born a little later. Her quirks would barely register today. For that, in today's culture. Janis Joplin is probably one of the ground-breakers responsible."
4,A solid behavioral profile within the context of the times.,"Echols provides rich and detailed insights into the motivations and behaviors of Janis Joplin. Her interviews with Joplin's friends, associates, and lovers, adds a complexity and understanding as to why this great talent was so self-destructive. Echols does all of this with a historian's need to place the events within their context...the 60's. I came away with a better understanding of this cohort. Myra Friedman's book pales in comparision."
1,Scars of Sweet Paradise:The Life and Times of Janis Joplin,I felt that the text was very repetitive. The same stories told over and over again. Chronology was difficult to follow. I would not recommend this book.
4,BUYER BEWARE!!,"Barnes & Noble.com has this book for $15.60, a savings of $10.40, Amazon.com is $18.20, a savings of only $7.80.You choose."
5,Excellent,"Alice Echols skillfully weaves the cultural nuances of the complicated '60s with the life and times of the great Janis Joplin. Informative and painstakingly researched. This book is far superior to Myra Friedman's overrated ""Buried Alive,"" which is a vast pile of stinky doo-doo rather than a definitive biography. Avoid ""Buried Alive"" and get this book instead."
5,An extraordinary piece of work,"This work achieves the impossible in exploring the various facets and contradictions in Janis Joplin's life with real sympathy and understanding, a standout gem being the phrase 'context is everything.' Above all, it explains why and how she became to be the person that she was which is an achievement in itself. Most interesting are Alice Echol's exploration of the emergence of the hippie culture in which Janis Joplin is placed, rejecting eaasy stereotypes and getting away from the airbrushed version which it is too easy to accept. Quite simply, this is the best pop biography ever."
5,Terrific book!,"Alice Echols teases out the meanings of Joplin's short life -- the predicament of thebrilliant woman artist trapped in the same masochistic love-me leave-me I'm worthless mentality that characterizes her songs. Much more than a show-biz biography, this is a wonderful work of feminist social history, full of information, insights, and extremely well written."
4,unbiased and full of info,"Just having finished this wonderful book, I realize my brain is now full of so much new information. This great book not only speaks unbiasedly about Janis, it speaks unbiasedly about the 1960's. I'm 19 years old and all that I've heard about the '60s is that they were so commune-like and everyone loved each other. Now, I know that is not true. I understand that was part of it, but it was just as ugly as today. If not more. In this book, it seemed as if Janis was speaking for herself. With such in depth interviewing with friends and family, it is hard not to feel like you knew and lived in the times of Janis Joplin."
4,Scarred but spectacular!,"With the expansion of opportunities for women today, it is difficult to comprehend how scripted young women's futures still were in the central US in the mid-60's. It was more of a struggle to break out of the mold then than teenagers today are aware of. That Joplin accomplished as much as she did is testimony to her raw determination to do something with the talent that she possessed; that she was unable to avoid the twin pitfalls of alcoholism and addiction only makes her seem more human. Despite its sometimes dry style, Scars of Sweet Paradise provides an important perspective and gives unique insights through interview sources unavailable to previous biographers. Consequently, I found Echols's book more compelling and insightful than either Buried Alive or Pearl."
4,Times are a Changin',"I found this book to be quite interesting on the level of an historical and cultural analysis of Janis's life. Echols manages to write an objective biography on Joplin that does not get too sentimental or depressing, as have other biographies on Janis. This biograpy provides one with an education on the late 50s/ early 60s (on the level of history and lifestyle); however, it is not as personable as other biographies. Overall a very good book."
4,"It's Okay, But Only Holds 3 GBA Games","I got this case as a gift, and it's a great case if you want to take your GBA SP and a few games for a short trip. If, like me, you like to take several games and the adapter on longer trips, it's just too small.At most, the case can hold the GBA SP (and one game inside) and 3 additional games. The games are stored in a little pocket on the front of the pouch, protected only by the flap. This isn't a lot of protection, should the case fall. The SP itself is pretty well padded in this case, as it provides enough protection for the system itself.I have taken to using another backpack to hold additional games and the adapter, but I still put the system inside this case before putting it in the backpack.If you want a cheap case or only have a few games, then this is the case for you!"
2,"For ten bucks, it should hold more games...","There is a definite benefit on one of these cases -- I own one -- and that is keeping the GBA protected from the wear-and-tear of day-to-day use. However, the inabilty to carry more than three games (one in the GBA and two in the pouch) is moderately annoying. Get this if you're going to have your GBA floating around in your backpack or messenger bag."
4,A great buy for a begginer,"I dont know what people are talking about i love this case. The inside is really soft to keep your gameboy advance sp from scratching. Although it is pretty small you can atleast still fit 3 games in it and whoes gonna bring more that that anyway, right?! I would say that if your a game freak and have alot of games this probibly isnt for u. But if your like me its great and for only 10.00$ how can u go wrong!?"
3,OK Case,"Overall the case works. It is nicely constructed and holding up fine. The only two issues are the size - it is a little on the small side. The GBA SP fits, but it is kind of a tight fit. My 6 year old son kind of struggles with it and therefore doesn't use it as much as I would like. I think for an ""older"" user this wouldn't be an issue and keeping the case as small as possible could be a plus based on the user. The other size issue is a lack of space to carry games in the game pocket. Without the GBA already in the case you can squeeze 4 cartridges in there, but this makes it even harder to get the GBA in and out. If you only wanted to carry 2 games in there not a problem, but more than that it is kind of hard. For the price it is very good case, beside the size."
4,nice!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,It is real good for carrying all your games and your accessories and your sp.I think this a good buy.
1,"No, you don't need it...","Put your gameboy in a plastic bag and don't be a complete idiot with it. Problem solved.There is no need to buy this carrying case. I saw it and immediately said ""no"". Seriously, 2 games in the SP. If this thing held like 6 games and didn't look like a purse, than enjoy."
5,Highest Knowledge,"Authentic and authoritative work on Highest Knowledge, nothing primitive, nothing mundane, no dogmas, non-sectarian. The eternal knowledge / truth in this book is timeless and universal. A must-have in a seeker's library."
4,A classic album - it still is.,"Michael Martin Murphey has always done pretty good stuff, and this album was one of my favorites, so I was glad when it finally became available on CD. And, after all, ""Wildfire"" is a classic in its genre, in spite of the much-joked-about line where the horse (and subsequently the girl) dies because of a ""killing frost"" (which most certainly CAN kill... a tomato plant)! It's still a good album."
3,Blue Sky Night Thunder,This CD has two well known songs- Wildfire and Carolina in the Pines. The Greatest hits CD has several more songs to enjoy. Michael Martin Murphey was great in the 70s and still performs very well.
5,Master of the Cowboy Song,"This is an early release for Michael Murphy who added ""Martin"" to his stage name. This to me is his strogest release with some really great stories and unfortunately one of his only mainstream hits ""Wildfire"" which will always be one of my favorite songs. I have played his music on my radio show and and continue to enjoy it after all these years.Glad it is on CD. Buy it if you are a MM fan."
5,Bring back memories,I had this CD in a 33 album.... yes still have my old records. It brought back a lot of memories. Thanks for the quick response and shipment so I could enjoy for Christmas.
5,Another must-have MMM album,"It seems like all of MMM's albums are classics, but this one has the breakout hits 'Wildfire' and 'Carolina in the Pines'. Hidden later on is the song 'Without My Lady There', which has a California sound that I think Jimmy Buffett imitates so poorly. The songs are well-written and the music is awesome...this is an album for the MMM collection no matter what!"
1,Blue Sky - Night Thunder,We love Micheal Martin Murphy but this CD is terrible. Do not waste your money buying it!
3,"Sounds good, but Dock doesn't work","Bought this last night and am returning it today. One of the big factors in my decision to buy this product was the inclusion of an iPod dock and the ability to control the iPod from the remote control. Well, the remote control doesn't work on the iPod. But what's worse is that the iPod itself is unresponsive when in the dock - I can't even operate it manually. Hoping all I needed to do was upgrade the Philips unit's software, I went through the lengthy process of downloading the upgrade, burning it to disk, and then upgrading the unit... to no avail. All I can do is start the iPod playing, then insert it into the dock and hope I don't need to ff/skip/rewind/pause/etc. Pretty disappointing."
3,Terrible packaging,The home theater system was packaged is a box that was almost a foot longer then the unit itself. There was no packing material and the top of the box was crushed inward. The unit was undamaged (fortunately) and is working properly. I submitted a photo to Amazon regarding the packaging and never received a reply.
1,Doesn't work,"I purchased this unit on sale. I set it all up and found out the DVD didn't work. It kept saying ""no disc"". Tried the USB and it was dead, too. Put it away for a couple of days and tried again. Got no power at all. Nothing works. Totally dead. Its frustrating because it was several weeks from when I purchased it until I got it. It was refurbished so did not have a long warranty."
1,Should Have Read Reviews Before I Bought It,"I wish I would have seen Matt's review before I bought this unit. I've had very good luck with Philips products, so I have no doubt that this is a quality product, but I'm with Matt on this one. Philips, why would you design your speakers like this? I opened the box, saw that I couldn't use my 12 gauge wiring already installed in my room, and I have to take it back. Very dissappointing Philips..."
1,useless to me,"I bought the Philips HTS3544 this evening and I returning it tomorrow morning. It only took me long enough to open the box before I realized it would be useless to me. All of the speakers are hardwired to their cheap standard 20 gauge wire and they have special plug-ins into the unit so you can't just open the speakers and replace the wire with better. I have spend $200 in wiring my theater with 12 guage so I wouldn't have to have wire running all along my floor. If you want a simple bookcase unit, go for it, it may be great, but for a more custom installion, this mickey mouse arrangement just doesn't cut it. Philips, why would you design such limitations into your product? Shame on you."
1,Didn't know it would be May-December romance,"Worked fine at first. Initially was only using it as a CD player, and was happy with the sound. Later on, we bought a HDTV, and I was happy with the Philips' DVD playing ability. But 6-9 months later, when playing DVDs, this thing would sometimes freeze up/crash. I would have to unplug/replug to reset it. But never was there an issue playing a CD. After another 3-6 months, it would not play a complete DVD without freezing/crashing. So I pulled out an older DVD player, and relegated the Philips to CD duty. For only a few months, until this week. It crashed playing a CD, and now will not respond at all to unplugging/replugging, and one of my CDs is trapped inside. I look forward to busting up this thing to get my CD back. Philips again? Never."
1,It crashes!,"Philips HTS3544 Home Theater System with iPod Connectivity (Silver)Everything works as advertised. And, the price is competitive. But, it crashes! Like a poorly configured computer sometimes it becomes unresponsive. Not even the power button will work. The only solution is to unplug it from the wall. This is a repeat problem and a repeat pain. Like many people, all my cables are hidden behind bulky furniture. So unplugging it is an effort.I will replace this as soon as possible. I do not recommend it."
5,Very Good Home theater system,"Sound Quality:It is significantly better than the several 2.1 systems (for pc) I used before. The sound is warm, crisp, deep and calm. It does not create a dramatic sound field as I expected, but it is still good enough for a five star.USB input:Pros: It can play pictures, musics and even avi,DivX files on usb drive. The music files can be played promptly. And you can play musics and pictures at the same time.Cons: It is kind of slow when loading the pictures.FM radio:The hole in the FM antenna is a square while the pin on the receiver is round. I finally connected them together the third time I tried. The Radio did not work until I connected the antenna.In all, it is a pretty good system for the money."
5,Makes a GREAT gift for the man in your life!,"I bought this for my husband's birthday, and I think by far, this is the best gift I have ever given him! It was affordable, super easy to install, and has supreme quality sound! The speakers rattle the windows in the house!!I would highly recommend this product for a gift for the man in your life, or anyone looking for an affordable surround sound!His favorite feature : The iPod dock that allows him to not only listen to his music, but change songs via the remote as well. (as it charges too) Even works on his iPod touch!I really hit a home run with this one :)"
3,"Good product, great customer service","The first DVD player with surround sound speaker system I recieved was defective. The sound was amazing, but the DVD player itself would not play DVDs properly. I alerted the seller, and was instructed to send the DVD player back to them (this was a refurbished DVD player, by the way). Within about a week and a half, I received a new refurbished DVD player, and haven't had any problems since. Now the product works great!"
1,Was fine until it quit working,"I bought this system and loved it. It had decent sound and would play all dvds from all regions! But, like many others here, after just thirteen months it quit recognizing DVDs at all. It just says LOADING.....NO DISC. I went to Panasonic's website and it says the laser must be bad. What a pile of cheap junk."
4,Good buy!,"The system arrived in excellent condition. It was easy to set up, (good instructions) and it has features I was surprised to find on a system at this price, such as adjustable volume for each speaker. My wife likes the convenience of the ipod dock and the uninterrupted music play that allows. We haven't tried the slide show feature yet, but like the idea. The sound quality is as good as can be expected for the price."
1,I bought this item 6 months ago. It worked wonderfuly until now..DVD doesn`t read disks anymore..Im so disappinted :(,I bought this item 6 months ago. It worked wonderfuly until now..DVD doesn`t read disks anymore..Im so disappinted:(
2,i would not recommend this product,"This product only sounds good after fiddling with the individual volume channels for each speaker, and even then the quality is not good. The major drawback is that this systems volume can not be programmed on a universal remote. On the universal remote, major drawback with this device. Other than that the menu is only active in DVD/Disc mode... and will randomly reset the menu and volume settings. I would not recommend this product!"
4,great for the price! Slow load time!,"We love this speaker/DVD system. We got it to replace our old shelf cd system and got a DVD player as a bonus (even though we didn't need it). It is great for the price. We are not audio experts and sounds good to us.Two cons: 1. It takes a really long time to switch between modes or start playing from power on. Close to 20 seconds until it states playing.2. The other issue I've found is when connecting our tv audio (via RCA cables) to the speakers the sound is very tinny. I don't know if it is the cable I'm using or what, but my other attached devices sound great (via coaxial).With those two small cons I would still recommend this set up for those wanting a cheap unit for good sound."
2,"Doesn't do what it says, too small","didn't help at all, and for something you're supposed to give more than once a day depending on the size of the child, it should come in larger then a 2 oz bottle."
2,lackluster,"If you really enjoy the young Judy and her musical arrangements, you may enjoy this CD. I for one, prefer the older Judy especially her concerts. This CD has none of the ""punch"" in the musical arrangements that you will find in Judy's concert performances. This CD is music taken from the original movies. Also, the arrangements on this CD for karaoke purposes are not easy to follow nor do they make you really feel like singing. Of course, music is very subjective and of a personal nature. As I said above, I prefer the more ""exciting"" arrangements from Judy's concert performances.I believe that if you have a stereo system that is karaoke equipped, you would be much happier using one of Judy's live Cd's and using karaoke controls to block voice and/or music. I have had great success with Judy at Carnegie Hall and some of her TV Show Cd's..As for this particular karaoke Cd, I will relegate it to my collection of background music."
1,"poor design, poor quality","I purchased this Rubbermaid wastebasket through Amazon and it was shipped by BIC Superstores. I tried to call them but just got an answering machine.The wastebasket lid just falls off on the floor, if you try to raise the lid. There is no way to attach the lid. It is obviously a defective product. The shipping on the 12.72 cent item was 8.67. A ripoff!!!! And there is not even a person to talk to.don't bother!!!!!!!!!!!!!JennyRubbermaid FG280300AQUAM Dual-Action Wastebasket"
4,Nice gift for the teen,The purchasing experience was great. I received the product in a timely manner and the packaging was in good tack.
3,Not wearable,The fishhook that goes in your ear is very large. In fact too large for my pierced ear. If your lobes are stretched they will probably be okay. Other than that they are cute enough.
1,Forget the Kindle version!,"I purchased the Kindle version because I thought it would be a satisfactory version. I was wrong! It looked like someone used a Xerox machine from the '80s to make it. I had to get a refund on this one. I am pretty sure the physical book will be great, but stay away from the digital version.Edit: I used Amazon's ""Click to LOOK INSIDE!"" service to view the physical book. It, too, looks to be a very poor quality. If you publish a book, make sure it looks good and is not full of spelling mistakes. I will not be purchasing this one."
4,Fantastic exploration of Great Basin Nature and History,"The giant Great Basin Desert was covered by Great Lakes sized bodies of fresh water 10 000 years ago. Today it is dry and salty dotted with salty inland seas and isolated mountain ranges teeming with biodiversity.This book is a journey through old Lake Bonneville and Lake Lahonatan to today's Lake Tahoe, Mono Lake, Great Salt Lake, and Pyramid Lake. Along the way we meet the Humboldt River and mountains of the Great Basin. A truly great read for natural history buffs and those fascinated by America's least known desert."
2,Where are the real divas?,"The only real divas on this CD are Cher and Stevie Nicks. They've earned the right. Especially Stevie because she writes her own songs. Anastacia and Shakira??????? Why are they on this. And they both sound horrible. And Celine, while sporting a divas voice, cannot sing rock n' roll. The Dixie Chicks are definitely talented, but it was the presence of Nicks that got the crowd response. Cher and Stevie have stood the test of time and are legends. There should have been more Stevie on the album and maybe another diva such as Ann Wilson of heart or even Sheryl Crow. Hell, most of these women aren't divas; they are divettes in training. Yuck!!"
3,Better Off Live....,"Obviously a live album is meant to be heard that way and that way really only.....LIVE! The only good tracks on this cd are TRACK 1, TRACK 3 TRACK 7, AND the ANASTACIA, CHER AND CELINE PARTS OF TRACK 9....the rest would have been much better live and sadly Shakira sounds horrible on this cd....and I am a huge fan! Be careful when you buy this...."
5,Perfect!,"I gave the binding of this book a good workout the first day I received it. Dennis McKinney gives a wealth of information on Colorado's SWAs. I moved from the Upper Penninsula of Michigan to Colorado Springs and was wondering where I could hunt deer, elk, waterfowl, and small game (This book is going to have me doing more fishing too). This book gave me exactly what I needed. It provides sizes, locations and directions, type, quality of fishing and hunting, and regulations of all State Wildlife Areas. He even provides useful tips like maybe needing a 4WD vehicle to access certain areas. If you want to hunt and/or fish in Colorado and are wondering where to go, start with this book. Contains many nice color photos as well."
3,"Hunting and fishing guide, not a wildlife guide","Hunting and Fishing is the focus of this guide. Wildlife viewing is a third, but more distant focus. The list of wildlife often refers you to the birds and animals listed under hunting. This guide could have been so much more if there had been better and more detailed wildlife information. I would have also enjoyed information on habitat and plants. On the other had this guide does a good job on the rules, camping information, directions and has some interesting general information. I imagine that fishing and hunting enthusiasts would love this guide. As a wildlife enthusiast I am moderately disappointed."
2,a better idea...,"This item is WAY overpriced! As a clarinet player and teacher I agree a thumb protector is useful, especially for beginners who resort to poor right hand position due to the discomfort of most thumb rests. I suggest using a 2"" long soft plastic pencil grip. cutting off a 1/2 inch piece and sliding it onto the thumb rest; one size fits most. I give one to all my clarinet students at the beginning of the school year and they love them."
1,The music is great - I just never received the CD!,"After finding such a great price on this classic CD of Michael Martin Murphy's (only $3.99 with Auto-Rip), I was so anxious to add the CD to my MMM collection. That was until I received the notification that it was ""returned as undeliverable"". Amazon used FedEx for shipping (I believe) so I have no idea what happened. I wish they had used the U.S. Postal Service - they never seem to have a problem finding my address. Not sure if I can trust Amazon to deliver the products I buy anymore."
3,An okay product,"Being a little cheaper (or at least they were at the time of my purchase) than the other brands, these arent so bad. Unfortunately they don't seem to last nearly as long as the other brands. The actual piece that gets hit by the firing pin eventually gets pushed so far in, that the pin no longer hits it fully and eventually becomes the same as dry firing, but i guess thats why they include 6..."
4,They help protect the firing pin!,"I would recommend these to anyone trying to sharpen their skills while dry firing a pistol or revolver. They do help protect the firing pin, but the duration you can get out of each snap cap is questionable. I do tend to worry when the rear of these fake ammo rounds begins to develop dimples that goes too deep. It's hard to say how long they will last if used constantly. Use them with caution and be prepared to replace them over time."
3,Not light reading,"I had to read this book for a course on the Legislative Process. While it is definitely readable, and well-researched, it is expectedly dry. Sinclair describes methods that are becoming more common in getting major legislation passed, and shows that this unorthodoxy is not necessarily a bad thing. The first half of the book describes the changes that the system has undergone, while the second half illustrates how these methods affected several major bills. Examples include a national service bill, regulatory overhaul, an omnibus drug bill, and two budgets."
4,Informative Book,"This book is a great source of information on the legislative process in Congress today. It is a bit technical and has a lot of examples (that you can skim over), but it is very informative. If you want to know more about the legislative process or are going to work on the Hill, this is definitely a useful book."
3,Very timely,"I received the book in a timely manner. It was in an ok condition, I was expecting a little better based on the description, but it is okay."
3,Rather disappointed,"I just expected more from this 3 book set. The photos are very modern. There aren't close ups of the work of. There is very little text, just at the front of the book. I was hoping for something more in depth. It helped a little into my insight to CoCo Chanel, but not much."
4,A piece of Fashion History,"This set is a nice introduction into the world of Chanel. Be it for the perfume or the cloths, it gives one a cross section of the development of the brand name."
2,Fine for modern mouthpiece but not old ones,"This is probably fine for a new mouthpiece, but did not fit my old (50s) mouthpiece."
1,Very Trite,This song is what is wrong with Country now. Shannon while I am sure she is nice is just another choir singer. I would not reccomend buying this
1,Unable to review due to not able to listen to it.,"I am unable to write a review, I need to listen to the single first to make sure it's what I want."
5,Get prepared,"I just received the new Shannon Brown cd in the mail yesterday - ""Corn Fed"" and get ready Gretchen Wilson - you had better move over just a little. Big 'N Rich have found them another bright star on the horizon and is she ever going to shine. Start saving your pennies - this promises to be a top 10 seller if ever there was one. Great voice and new songs to boot. Unclechaz"
4,Great new artist,Shannon's music shows her to be one of country music's hottest new stars with great potential.
5,"Followed the Waves now in USA, great !","What an rock'n'roll career Melissa Auf der Maur has had thus far. A former bassist in Holeand The Smashing Pumpkins, front woman to a side project called Hand Of Doom - the amazingBlack Sabbath tribute band - and now a solo singer; The Canadian woman definitely has exceptional talent.Followed the Waves is the first single to be released from her first class, self-titled debutalbum ""Auf der Maur"".This song features a little heavy/grunge style.Her voice is definitely gorgeous !Melissa Auf der Maur's transition from another band's bass player to solo singer/songwriter seemed to be remarkably succed. A strong praise can be lavished on a very talented and arousing musician."
5,great single,"at the beginning I was quite shocked. I didn't know rock could be such a spacious thing. Perhaps it's because we're listening to tons of bad material and once we get something awesome is almost a surprise! in this case, it's a wonderful surprise!"
3,"novelty, perhaps...","Lesley Rankine's (aka ruby) first band. Weird, thrashy punk, with lyrics that include repeating the song title over and over. Makes no sense, but interesting for ruby collectors!"
3,HUNGRY ONINBO,"Oninbo is still hungry for Bugs from Hell, and still just happens to be saving people's lives as a by-product of his appetite. There are plenty of people out there nursing secret sins and wasting away from regrets of the past. All Oninbo wants is a meal, but he has some competition. His fellow demons Himenbo, who almost passes for a cute little girl, and Mamushinbo, a Peter Lorre look-alike whose one goal in life is to stomp on his rival Oninbo, will periodically team up and fight each other for a share of a bug! This volume had some slightly more disturbing images than volume 1 but actually this would be considered light-hearted comedy from Hideshi Hino. Kinda like if the Marquis de Sade wrote a children's book. It's also one of the rare Hino works that ends each episode with a positive event. The humans whose bugs have been eaten can become better people. If only we all could."
5,Be careful what you ask for.,We all dream about the perfect life and the way it could be 'if only....' How do we know what will make our life better or worse? Now this is a puzzle that could a class a whole week to solve.
5,My Favorite!,This was my favorite book when I was little. I read it over and over. Now I am twenty eight and I read it to my two year old son all the time. It is one of his favorites too!
2,depressing book,"I love all the caldecott medal books that I bought for my son but this one was so-so. It was sort of depressing for a children's book. Kids will have enough sadness to experience in life so I don't feel my child needs to learn about depression and hopelessness just yet. I think the story mentions the word hopelessness several times in this book- something very odd for a child's book. I am not downplaying depression & emotions but for a child's book, this is just too depressing of a read. When Sylvester turns into a rock, he becomes hopeless & keeps sleeping more & more & his parents cry & try to forget about him since he is gone (dead). I was getting all down reading this book. My son kept throwing the book on the floor when I'd try to read it to him-- something he never does w/ other books. I guess he doens't like it either. Maybe he's too young- 4 yr. old?"
3,Not appropriate for the age group I purchased for,Good fun book for older kids I painted a pebble to go with book it was fun but too sad for 2 year old
1,caveat emptor,"I was horrified . Yes I paid under a dollar for a used children's paperback, but the postage was four dollars. I'd had three or four copies of same title over the years. Each was at least 81/2 inches x 11 and paid maybe $3. I had never before seen a 3x4 inch version with print too small for any young child.Nothing in the ad warned me."
3,"Good book, old fashioned, traditional","This is a traditional tale with a moral to be learned.Nothing fancy, no high class illustrations that reach out and grab you. Nice color usage, sentence structure, and tone."
1,"Sad, depressing story","I bought this book - sight unseen - because it was on my son's reading list for kindergarten. I about cried the first time I read it - it is very sad. It is about a boy who gets a magic pebble, and he can get whatever he wishes - and he accidentally turns into a rock and his parents cannot find him and mourn his loss. Then circumstances happen that he turns back into himself - like a year later. I just thought it was very weird and we will likely donate this book to the local library. Did not like it at all."
2,Not too good,"I bought this green tea. It really curbs your appetite, but when i take it twice or three times, I get frequent heart beat, heart burn, and I always puke. I never lost any weight after trying it for 10days. This thing is really harsh even when I sleep. It might work for others though."
3,It was good.,"I didn't see any results, even with changing my diet and exercise. I think seeing results in the first two weeks would be more of an incentive to purchase the item again and continue using it, but because i didn't see any, i didn't bother to refill. I guess it works for some and not for others."
4,Not Exactly,"I like the little boost associated with taking this green tea extract but I don't really think that I'm going to loose a bunch of weight off of them. Then again, I'm just looking for the boost and not the weight loss. I guess you just have to see how they work for you."
1,Made me ill,"After taking this product for the first time, I was violently vomiting within 20 minutes. I don't know what they put in this to cause this kind of reaction in my body. I've never reacted like this to a product before. I really regret trying this and will never use it again. Everyone is different. maybe it'll work for you, but for me it was horrible!"
2,So overrated,"The reviews make this sound like some kind of miracle cure. Here's what you'll get - a caffeine boost. That's about it. Buy some coffee. It's tastier and cheaper.I used it, and occasionally noticed some caffeine headaches and dry mouth. What I did not notice was additional weight loss.Personally, the best thing I've seen on the market is straight up hoodia, in a higher dose formula. (This product contains just a trace of hoodia)."
1,Worthless-Does Nothing-Would Rate 0 stars if it were an option,"***I did not purchase this through Amazon. A pharmacist recommended it to me***I tried this out because it is supposed to suppress appetite and enhance energy. It did neither. In fact, with the exception of a very, very mild sense of agitation the first time I took it (lasted about 10 minutes), there has been no noticable effects at all. I cannot say whether or not it burns calories or fat because I gave up on it after a few days since I felt no effects at all.This product is worthless. I am amazed at how many good reviews have been posted about it. Either it has a great ""placebo effect"" or the company itself posted the reviews to deceive us!"
1,TOTAL B.S.,"Don't waste your money.After reading the positive reviews I thought I'd give these pills a try. I'm sure glad they were cheap because they performed about as good as a pint of ben & jerrys. NO appetite suppressing, NO extra energy, NOTHING! TOTAL EFFING GARBAGE if you ask me. I tried these other japanese diet pills that were supposed to be all natural and tho they made me feel terrible (slightly nauseated, a bit dizzy, extreme dry mouth, insomnia) I lost weight with no exercise or change of diet! I only took them for 1 week too!! I'll go back to those!!!!!!"
5,Appetite suppressant for sure!!!!,"I actually bought this from a local big name store for $4.00. I figured it would be another waste of money, but at least it was cheap! To my surprise, this has been the best appetite suppressant that I have found. I have had no jitters or nausea. I make sure to eat shortly after taking the pill in order to avoid nausea. Although, one day I took it with just V8 and was fine. I have only taken it for two days so I'm not sure about any sort of ""fat burning"" claim. However, I can surely claim that it has suppressed my appetite very effectively. Good luck to all of you trying to lose weight and get healthy!!!"
3,Buy at Dollar Store 98 cent store,Hey these are sold at the 98 cent store. Don't take on empty stomach or forget to eat. They will make you sick.
1,Didn't use it,Not usable when I did my thesis. The instructor's formula/helpful hints much better then what this could provide. Wasted money and donated book to goodwill.
2,Not as good as the original scent,"While the product smells alright, it doesn't even compare to the original fragrance. Not happy with it. So disappointed because I remember how wonderful it smelled on my husband. The original was intoxicatingly seductive. Sadly, this doesn't come close."
2,Wrong manual sent,"Michael L....Item received promptly, but it was the wrong year as stated. This was a 1969-1971 Full Factory Manual. There were not any full manuals for '68, just a supplement to be used in conjunction with the full '67 manual. This book was described as a '68 manual in the description portion of the page. There were no dates anywhere to be found on the cover or inside the manual itself stating a year at all. Chrysler made it very confusing way back then. A picture of the actual item would have saved me a lot of hassle."
5,It's the end...,"Farewell to Bren and Jago and Illsidi and Jase and Banichi, as well as all the other characters...It's hard to part after 6 books!"
5,Explorer,"Having read all 6 books in the Foreigner Series, I am sad to see this series at it's end. As Bren would say ""One highly recommends"" this outstanding series by C.J. Cherryh. It is however suggested that all 6 books are read in order.Happy reading"
5,CJ Cherryh Explorer,The Foreigner series is amazing and I had read this book before but wanted to have my own copy. As with all this series they are great to read over and over. pbshous gets them to me in NZ a lot quicker than their estimate & they are in mint condition
3,Too much Ilisidi,"I liked the book, but I'm getting really tired of Ilisidi, and her cane pounding - turning up at all climatic moments. I think she should spend much more time at Malguri.Also, does Bren really have to have all of that starched lace?SPOILER:Sitting out in space having refreshments with an alien is way too much!!"
3,Dissapointing..,"This soundtrack was only dissapointing to me because some of the tracks I looked most forward to hearing I didnt care for. I did not like Marissa Jaret Winokur's version of Good Morning Baltimore-it sounds way too whiny, and Jill Hayworth's version of Cabaret is nowhere near the passion of Liza Minnellis."
3,Mixed Bag,"Note that some of the recordings are not in stereo. While I expected that for some of the very old songs recorded in the 1920's to 1940's, I thought that the songs from the 1950's and more recent would have been recorded in stereo."
5,AWESOME movie!,"This is such a great movie, why isn't available on DVD? It's a wonderful story of loss, love and friendship. Some parts are very funny and the cast is a perfect combination of talent. I only wish I could buy it on DVD!"
4,Useful in Relationship Therapy,"Professional therapists would benefit from a viewing of this emotions/communications conflict. The characters struggle through the emotions of love, grief and loss and the ensuing identity crises in which they find themselves. Many female clients (and a few men), unable to write their own affirmation statements have been able to take Marsha Mason's monologue in the closing moments to inspire and motivate them in the capturing of their own identity and self-worth. And therapy issues aside, this is a wonderful classic. Out of print and distribution for several years, it's worth adding to most video collections."
4,Harper wows!,"Anything with Valerie Harper deserves at least 4 stars. I have seen this film, and while she looks terrible, her inner beauty and generosity of spirit are considerable. However, this is Marhsa Mason's film. She has even enough charm and energy to arouse shaggy dog James Caan. Still, this is a well-cast film---Caan's character, Neil Simon himself, a writer, should be an oddball. If you like or love The Goodbye Girl, you will find Chapter Two to be compatibly good."
2,Very disappointed,"I bought this SEALED, BRAND NEW VCR tape as a gift. (I could not find a DVD version of the movie.) The video was about what I expected--VCR quality. However, the audio was a nearly constant snap, crackle and pop. So bad that we were not really able to enjoy the dialogue or the music.I have some old VCR tapes, and they play fine, so I am certain the player is not the problem. I would not have expected this from a new, sealed tape, made in 1995, but maybe that is to be expected. If so, that information would have saved me a fair amount of money."
4,Write to Sony Pictures Studios,"It helps to write a letter to a studio when you want a movie released on DVD - this way they know what may make money for them.Here's Sony's address -DVD Release CoordinatorSony Pictures Studios10202 W. Washington BlvdCulver City, CA 90232I, too, love this movie and would like to have it on DVD.Start writing, folks!"
2,Why are some songs missing,"This is an overall good soundtrack, but there is a flaw. Ther are a few songs that were in the movie that didn't make it to the soundtrack and I am very dissapointed about that."
4,nothing to lose soundtrack,"nothing to lose soundtrack is da hottest soundtrack the best hits on it are not tonite by kim,angie,brat,missy,and the newest lisa ''lefteye'' lopez and the master p and mercedes song the soundtrack is my secomd favorite other than nutty proffeser 2 the klumps soundtrack although it did have its downs like on the queen pen song if you like artists like da brat,tru,eve,queen pen,ruff ryders,missy elliot,and rap music this is a pure soundtrack for ''hardcore'' fans thank you"
2,DVD rewiew,Very fast shipping ! But one of the DVD doesn't work well (the 4th one)... it seems a little bit scratch and half of the films are not working.
4,Early Soviet Union Worker Rights,"How interesting to have read about working conditions as they existed in the Soviet Union in the early 1900's. Managemnet tried , however, they did not succeed very well."
3,constant feature of the midwest punk scene in the 80's,"A great Wisconsin rock band that were ever-present supporting players in the 80's midwest punk scene. Another great ROCK band that gets lumped in with punk music because they're just too good for the radio; they're really more rock than punk. Their sound varied alot, each album being different - this one's got a monster rock metalish feel to the vocals, but with unpretentious guitar work that kinda in the vein of a Chicago or Boston sound (the music styles, not the bands, OK? try to keep up), and a nice hard-rock beat. I suppose that makes them prog-rock, but don't let that term turn you off, it's darker and a little harder than most prog-rock, so you won't get bored, it's not artsy-fartsy either."
5,Jag 9th Season,We have all the Jag DVD's to date. Love the series. We aren't sure why they are released so far apart. When will the last set be available?
2,The series continues to decline.,"The best seasons of this series are the third through the sixth. Subsequent seasons become less about the drama of the JAG, and more of an ongoing soap opera about the lives of the individual members, and seem to be searching for a focus. This series ended none too soon."
5,Jag one of TV's best series,"I would have to say that this TV series is one of the best, and the actors blend seamlessly with each other. This tv program is an excellent program, to bad they quit the series, for I would still be watching it."
1,Don't buy from this seller!,"Earlier this year, I ordered the Roary DVD for my son (a cartoon for preschoolers). The seller shipped me a book about some political candidate. I contacted Amazon and they agreed to resubmit the order and paid for expedited shipping (which I greatly appreciated). The seller then proceeded to send to me the Roary DVD COVER - with NO DVD INSIDE of it. My son was greatly disappointed. I was disgusted by the whole situation and have simply written this order off as a loss. However, I do feel it's necessary to forewarn prospective buyers about this seller - who is not reliable and does not deliver on their orders."
3,great show..but...,"My 2year old son loves this show...the problem is that they only play the opening theme song once at the beginning of the first episode. Toddlers love the opening song and so he gets bored because the episodesplay back to back and he doesn't get that excitement of hearing the ""song"" playing before each episode. He gets involved with other things and forgets to watch- it's like a one hour non-stop long drawn out episode rather than many smaller episodes."
1,broken so fast,"it's broken 1 and half month ago, without any human destruction, I called the macally company to seek for ways to fix it myself, apparently it wasn't working!"
1,bad quality,"This headset is definitely not worth the $100+ price tag. Even from the beginning the battery case wouldn't stay shut until I taped it down and now three months later the headset broke down. I was planning to use this around my dorm but the walls are too thick, so the wireless is completely pointless. The quality of the sound, the craftsmanship and the return/refund policy definitely makes this product not worth the money."
2,"Light, comfortable, good sound ... but poor quality!","I decided to try these after getting used to the freedom offered by wireless headphones. The other pair I own (another brand) work great but aren't that comfortable. I really prefer this style.Unfortunately, the quality is quite poor. The first pair I bought I had to return to the store immediately, because only one audio channel was functioning. The second pair worked great, and I was quite delighted with them. They are very comfortable and the sound quality is great. I was quite pleased.Unfortunately, a week later, they simply stopped working. It appears to be the ""sync"" issue others are reporting. I have to ship them back to Macally for service and I don't know how long the replacement will last ... hopefully third time is a charm.On the positive side, so far their support has been decent to deal with (I went the email route, haven't tried the phone)."
1,BlueWave: Buyer Beware,"Pros:1. Bluetooth2. Decent sound quality3. Decent sound dampening from the wrap around earpieces.4. ComfortCons:1. Cost is too high2. No way to re-synch if (when) they loose synch.3. Cheaply made, you will need to order a replacement battery door for dongle if it does not come with the purchase.4. Battery life is terrible.5. No rechargable battery option (like newer models of the wireless bluetooth)I knew this going in, so its more an FYI for new potential buyers)6. headset stopped working within 30 days (synch issue, its apparently common and the fix is to ship them to Mcally -- you pay the shipping).7. Very poor tech support from Macally. (if you can find the right number, its currently 909 230 6778 which will tell you, ""no tech is available, please email or hang-up"")"
4,Perfect for what I need!,"I bought this item because it was a MUCH better value than the cheap ones I was buying from Office Depot that broke the minute you tried to connect the place holder. This one is perfect, it moves and adjusts to where i need the copy held. The only problem is the place holder does NOT slide easily. It doesnt seem to slide with out pressure to make it move... afraid of breakin it off..."
3,A reasonably thorough and scholarly book.,"There is nothing exciting here, either in subject matter or writing style, but this is a reasonably good companion book for a reader of 19th Century British literature. Not essential; a reader capable of wading through this rather dry book is probably capable of figuring out most of what it has to say by reading between the lines of the literature itself, but for someone interested in the literature of the period, it couldn't hurt to read a bit of background."
3,Did the job but Not Happy!,"I bought these to repair a crack in a kayak. These rods melted on the surface and sealed the crack nicely! However, I really did not appreciate the excessive shipping charge from the supplier! I would think twice before buying from this company again! In short the product worked great but the supplier sucks!"
2,Close but no cigar!,"These are very cute, however, the sizes they place on these are nowhere near real sizes! Be careful when ordering & be sure to choose a size or two bigger than what is decribed. Also, made for skinny feet."
4,Try the real tour,"I actually did not read this book but did take an actual tour of Sunset Park, Brooklyn with Ms. Alperson (I rate the tour 4 stars). Ms. Alperson has a sense of humor and is passionate about food, as are those who take the tour. The whole point of the book is to get you into these neighborhoods to sample the foods. So if you aren't a book lover, go to Ms. Alperson's website (www.noshwalks.com) and sign up for a culinary tour. It's a great way to meet people, get to know a different NYC neighborhood, and try stuff you never would have otherwise. I have recommended the tour to friends who have really enjoyed it."
3,"Indifferent performances, bad edits, and below avarage mix","This is not a great release. The jams are cut and the best night of the run wasn't even used. I loved the sound of Brent's Fender-Rhoades electric piano during this period. Unfortunatly, it's been turned so low in the mix you can barely hear it. On tunes like Lazy Lightnin' Jerry and Brent's backing vocals have been erased. This release does have a nice setlist but bottoms out after High Time. Very little after this is actually noteworthy"
1,Did not work,"I am having to return the item, a real hassle, because it did not work straight out of the box. It would play CD's, but we tried several DVD's, some brand new, and it will not play them at all."
1,Avoid this model,"I had only played about 10 hours of DVD when it stopped playing VCD format disks. Because I rarely used this unit, the 90day warranty had expired. I would definitely AVOID Toshibas from now on. Such a waste of money considering I paid [what I paid] for this unit. The repair shop informed me the warranty only covers part, so I had to pay ... for labor. After some consideration, I decided to spend ... more and brought an APEX three disk carousel model(AD5131), ... It's working great, way more features than Toshiba or any other brands for about 1/3 the cost."
2,Skipped badly,"I played three dvd movies and every one skipped and paused about every 10 minutes. It also skipped on a cdr. The mp3 playback worked but has no functions, no id3 tags, no shuffle. You can skip through tracks, but thats about it. I tried to play a cdr with mpeg files and nothing happened except some soundtrack like music that wasnt even on the disc. I sent it back as a defective unit. The skipping problem seems to be common with a lot of dvd players based on many reviews I have read. I am going to try some other brands and see if one will work. Altogether, very disappointing"
5,Great Buy! But MP3 disks take some work...,"It's an excellent player with a rich feature set and excellent price. It took work to produce MP3 disks that work with this player. The CD must be ISO 9660 formatted as a data CD. Easy CD Creator can do this but you must goof around with the settings in Easy CD Creator for it to work. After messing aound with settings in Easy CD Creator, I was able to burn MP3 CD's that play correctly. Toshiba says in their ""Guidelines for playback of MP3 Encoded Compact Discs"" (included with the documentation with the player) to use 74 minute CD-R's. However, I used 80 munute CD-R's (Memorex) sucessfully."
2,Toshiba SD2715 drawbacks,"First I would like to say if you have this player do not buy a Yamaha reciever to go with it. If you do get a new DVD player or at least the firmware upgrade. What happens is this. If you use digital sound it will make popping noises when switching between menus ..very annoying. Also after the firmware upgrade I have now had some srious problems with this player skipping scenes...also very annoying.Also,can you say slow? This has to be one of the slowest players I have ever come across. It does play everything but it sure takes its time getting going.on the plus side it has a very good remote and as a whole the dvd player would be awesome if I could just be sure that I was going to see the whole movie everytime. I thought the cutout scenes were suppose to be in the menu not during the movies...at random!!!!!!!!Do some research first. BUY WITH CAUTION!!!!!!!"
1,Disappointing,"I've had good luck with Toshiba products in the past (I own two of their TVs and two VCRs), but this DVD player has been a major disappointment. Unfortunately, I didn't discover some of this DVD players' shortcomings until after [local store's] return policy had expired, so I couldn't return it. I bought the carousel model so I could use it to play a selection of CDs at random, but it is very clumsy to program the random feature, and it's VERY slow between selections. Also, you actually have to program this thing EVERY time you play more than one disc, or it will just stop after it plays one disc. The DVD player creates a nice picture, but there have been way too many skips during playback."
2,Runs out of Gas,"This book starts out with an interesting premise, but it soon becomes simply tedious."
2,A Students Opinion,"NOTE #1: Have a person who likes the book to tell you where the relevant material is located. Good book only after hours of concentration. The BSL makes large jumps, so be ready. It is an 'old school' book; most of the time the author is performing unnecessary mathematics (the computers ablity has changed alot). I prefer more physical application."
3,(Too) Classical textbook,"This is classical textbook for all ChE. It shows incradibly insight in unified approach for fluid mech and heat and mass transf. However, for me, I think this one is too classical for undergrad student now. Anyway, there is no the other books in field , which can compare to this one (I have been waiting also)."
4,Good book,I purchased this book to go along with the teacher edition I previously purchased (from a different seller). It will be the perfect accompaniment as I teach Phonics.
2,Choose another brand,"Makes excellent coffee, but I don't recommend this product. The glass flask broke very easily with little cause. I tried to replace it, but Bodum's online purchase process didn't work. I purchased another brand from Progressive ([...]) at my local hardware store for about half the price. I like the plastic frame of the Progressive because it retains the glass flask for improved handling and cleaning. The Bodum flask was loose in the metal frame and could slide out."
2,"so good but not so good,,,",I love the coffee - I had this press for about 2 weeks and loved it-- I did use HOT water not boiling and the glass beaker cracked...only 2 weeks old and it is off to recycling heaven!!
4,French press coffee pot,I loved this coffee pot...the coffee was great from it...the only problem with it was it is breakable and I broke the carafe so I had to go to a full metal pot....The coffee is just as good.
2,Not my favorite Ursula 1000 CD,"I really enjoy Here Comes Tomorrow, and also like Kinda Kinky. Ursadelica has several tracks that seem to repeat the same beat and noise over and over."
5,For Swingers Only!,"A great, funky little album. After you're done with the smooth stylings of whichever Hotel Costes volume you have, if you're in the mood for something a little wild, something a little zany, this is your disc! A psychadelic cocktail lounge party crashed by funksters, go-go dancers, mods and rockers. A good time for all!"
5,Revisit the 80's style,"Fantastic comedy fluff that reminds me of the 1980's classics such as Porky's or Fast Times. You will get hijinks of a crude variety but mostly funny not exploitive, well not too much anyway. This is a double feature too so watch them in order for greater effect. The clarity of the picture is brilliant and both films are perfect for that late night viewing with a few drinks."
2,Look elsewhere for a vacuum,worked well for 1st 6 months and then has been eating up belts at least monthly...have been thru at least 5 belts...easy to replace but annoying. There are better values for the same price...the Bissell line gets much better reviews.
2,yuck-ola,This vacuum was great for about 5 months. The belt comes off all of the time! The hose clogs easily and I am constantly beating crud out of different parts and the filter! I have had several vacuums and I cannot seem to find a good one that I can afford...so I am going to spend more money next time. Good luck!
1,nice while it lasted,"We bought a Eureka Whirlwind Litespeed vacuum just over two years ago upon purchase of our new (to us) home. For the first year and a half, we loved the vacuum. It performed wonderfully under very modest use.Alas, no longer. It breaks belts on a regular (approx. every 2 weeks) basis. Despite changing height settings, cleaning debris from the rollers, inspecting and scrubbing all moving parts and even trying belt dressing, I now spend more time changing belts than vacuuming. This is highly frustrating, as you might imagine.In my letter to Eureka, I ask the following questions: Should I bring the machine with me on my trip to the landfill this week, or try some yet-unthought-of trick to keep the vacuum cleaner working? Presuming the former is my best option, do you have a suggestion on a similar replacement vacuum from another manufacturer that might last as long as, say, the Hoover upright I owned previously that lasted 20 years while breaking only a half-dozen belts?"
2,Save up and buy a Dyson instead,"After two years the gasket which seals the top of the canister leaks resulting in a considerable loss of suction. Replacing the gasket is of little use since the plastic canister itself has deformed under the strain of opening and closing and will no longer make an adequate seal. It's hard to understand why any manufacturer would put critical functionality at risk over such minor stuff. I seriously doubt that Eureka gave this feature adequate testing before moving to production. Does not speak well to the quality of the engineering at Eureka. Still, I've owned worse vacuum cleaners."
3,Tokyo Mew Mew japanimation,"This cd is actually pretty good considering I don't like tokyo mew mew . I really like the music (especially Zakuros theme Mintos and Purins theme I like aswell) but I was hoping for songs sung by the actresses . If you want songs sung by them I suggest you go for one of the super best hits or if you like the instrumental elements then I seriously suggest this cd .I really like the music on this but I hate Ichigo so I'm taking off two stars .But I like Zakuro, Minto and Purin so this cd IS SO WORTH it but I actually did'nt get it for $60 I got it for $39 something so I think amazon is ripping you off .Also the cd cover is paperback which is cool .So get it but be warned you're getting ripped off ."
3,market umbrella,"Pretty umbrella - poor manufacturing. The ribs were made of poor quality wood, already splintered and one rib partially cracked. Poor stain job, and very hard to lift by the pulley system; it's easier to just push it open. It's OK for the money, but wouldn't buy another."
5,Rome Antics,David is an awesome writer and can sketch a picture that will draw you in. He uses all this to covertly educate you on the topic at hand. Rome Antics is clever from the title page on. Buy it and enjoy it.
3,creative and fun; no plot,"This book reminds me of ""Once Upon A Banana"" by Jennifer Armstrong in showing a series of scenes and something moving through the pages (in this case, a homing pigeon. We really like ""Once Upon a Banana,"" by the way.)The back of the book has the information you need to understand the different buildings and piazzas, plus a map. The rest of the book is just the pigeon being cute.Beautiful architectural drawings, though."
3,Rome Antics by David Macaulay,"Cute story, but was hoping it was like his other book Motel of the Mysteries and it wasn't the same. I enjoyed Motel so much that I was a little disapointed by this one, but it is a good book otherwise."
2,Kris who?,"well, let's put it this way, i don't know how kris kristofferson got on the album...he certainly qualifies as a writer, but he sure does not have anything close to a memorable voice. And pitting up against/with willie, waylon and johnnie makes it even more apparent! The other 3 are fabulous, but unfortunately, this becomes more of a Smithsonian concert, than great sounding music. Must have been a political decision to have Kris along. Too bad...it would have been a 10+ without him!"
4,Nobody else mentioned it,Negative Approach is fantastic. Nobody else mentioned it so I'll say that you should also check out the Laughing Hyenas. This is what Negative Approach turned into. Hard Times is a kickin' bluesy postpunk album. If you were listening to Negative Approach when you were young you've probably grown up a bit by now. Nice to see how there hardcore boys matured.
3,Smack you in the face hardcore,". . .Angry, smack you in the face hardcore! Detroits answer to Minor Threat. Angry music for angry times(Ie: The Regan Adminsitration). Everybody, at least in Detroit was unemployed and everyone was pissed off. If you grew up in these troubled times you'll understand, if you didn't though you probably won't. Sound quality suffers however and this does diminsh some of the impact. Overall an important document of early 80's hardcore."
4,"Im angry, angry, angry , angry","I love negative approach. I really do. But if there is one drawback its that i cant listen to them all the time like some ofmy favorite bands like crass,addiction face,and the dead milkmen. Their just too angry. Ive got an analogy to sum it up for you. he hem. NEGATIVE APPROACH IS TO FURIOUS as DASHBOARD CONFESSIONAL IS TO UNREASONABLY BUTHURT OVER NOTHING. I love the album though i mean being mad isnt bad but N/A were certainly not the greatest."
