5,A Pizza Maker's Must Have Tool,"We make pizza every Sunday night. We'd cut our pizza with the regular rolling cutter which didnt always do a clean even cuts and toppings would move around. My husband insisted we NEEDED this cutter, just like the pizzeria has. So we ordered this World Class Cutter and I honestly was alil skeptical bc of the price and by its design. But once I used it, not only does it glide easily over the pizza, its also very sharp so the toppings dont shift. We have gotten some good use out of this cutter and I can tell it will hold up to being used regularly."
3,Wes - North Carolina,"This cutter isn't made heavy enough. It's simply a rolled piece of stainless and it lacks rigidity. There is a sense of ""flex"" when using it on a pizza and this is enough to cause the cut to be less than desired. choose something better built."
3,Better than plastic,I'm not as thrilled with this pizza cutter as I had hoped. I had a similar item that I bought from a childs fundraiser that was a hard plastic. I loved it but after about 6 months the edge started to chip away. So I figured I would go with a metal version. This is better only because it is metal but doesn't seem to slice as well as the plastic one I had. I am going to see if I can get it sharpened and see if it helps.
4,Use it every time!,"I use this every time I make or eat a pizza. I look for excuses to make a pizza to cut with this thing, it's pristine. Like any knife, it gets dull with repeated use.Marked it down 1 star because the rolled metal handle feels a little flexy and is difficult to clean."
3,It works but the weighting is awkward,It works as a pizza cutter but the weighting of the cutter makes it a bit difficult to cut it like a professional would. The force behind the cut is what makes these knives effective and worthwhile. Because of the way you have to hold this cutter it isn't as effective. I find myself pulling out a pizza roller to make additional cuts on nearly every pie.
3,rsvo pizza cutter,"overall it does what is supposed to do, however it could be a bit sharper and longer to cover an entire 8 cut pizza."
5,Chop chop,Great for cutting pizza or veggies. Washes well.. haven't had any issues with it rusting or anything when I throw it in the dishwasher.
4,Like it,"Only used it once so far. For me, it worked much better than the roller cutter. Have a sore wrist, the roller cutter always hurt my wrist. Would recommend it."
3,Okay,I was looking for something more effective then a typical wheel cutter but this isn't sharp enough to cut easily or through the whole pie.I'll keep it but am somewhat disapponted in it's effectiveness.
2,Barely Useful,"This cutter is not sharp at all. Even cutting thin, crisp crust pizza is a bit of a chore that requires repeated rocking of the cutter blade. The curved handle is offset from the cutting surface making usage even more of a challenge. Sharpening the stainless steel cutting edge makes it a bit more usable but even a chef's knife is better than this. I recommend buying another product."
4,Works Well,Easy clean up and is shape edge. Handy as cuter and scoop for picking things up when working with it.
4,Good Pizza Cutter,The blade is sharp and performs exactly as expected. It is dishwasher safe and cleans up easily. Recommend buying this pizza cutter
4,GREAT PIZZA CUTTER,"We really love this cutter, does a great job of cutting pizza without ""pushing"" toppings around like a roller cutter does. The rolled handle is comfortable to use, the edge cuts easily. This cutter is built well, it is made from heavy weight stainless steel that does not flex at all when using it and built to last, and it is easy to clean.The only drawback is finding a place to store it as it is almost 14 inches long and 4 inches tall, we just leave our on the back side of our dish rack ( which is stainless also so it blends right in, so much we forget it is there ) trying to store this in a drawer might be a problem. After using this for a while I wonder why I didn't get one earlier, it make cutting your pies so much easier."
3,comprehensive but questionable,"I was prompted to acquire this work after travelling along ""Bohicket Road"" south of Charleston, SC, and wondering about the origin of the name. A Google search turned up a page from this book, which looked as though there were entries for every state, including placenames for Washington, California and Idaho, many of which I'm familiar with. That impression was not misplaced. There are, indeed, entries for nearly every state in this 600-page work.However, some of the entries are...questionable, particularly with certain etymologies. Some are traced to Spanish placenames without explanation (e.g. ""Potos√≠ "" to a Bolivian mine). In Washington there are unexplained deviations from Chinook jargon to various ""Salishan"" dialects (e.g., ""Chuckanut""), making them hard to accept without additional attestation.Despite these gaps, I'm happy with my purchase because it is an entertaining and informative work, with wide application."
1,A lesson from Henry Ford,"Henry Ford said, ""I'll sell a car for $25.00- just give me the parts business."" Bissell took a lesson from this- the vaccuum was priced very attractively, and the only bags that fit- cost $...a piece! Brilliant! But I assure you, my next vaccuum will NOT be a Bissell.... by the way, did the other review read more like and advertisement? Think it might have been written by a Bissell employee?"
4,Simply Great Songs,"The second half of the new single, is just as good as the first part, if not better. It is also, hopefully, an indication that Travis' next album will be as great as their first two. The a-side is as catchy as anything on Top 40 radio. I've only had it a day and I'm already singing along to it. The cover of The Band' song ""The Weight"" is simply awesome."
4,Delightfully upbeat single,"Coming Around, which reached No. 5 in the UK upon its release in June, is a delighful slice of ear candy, pleasantly upbeat in juxtaposition to the more sombre album The Man Who. It makes the single worth buying alone, but their spot-on cover of The Band's The Weight, a highlight of their concerts, is quite moving, and makes this CD2 a must-have for Travis fans."
4,An excellent deal overall,"Pros:* very powerful suction* excellent edge cleaningCons:* excepting the motor, it is a conglomeration of cheap plastic parts* the hose is too short, though the hose extension is helpful and it does fit extension tubes from other vacuums* the electrical plug is not groundedOverall, I am very pleased. It suits my inclination towards things that work great and are cheap."
1,Hoover Poover,"My sister in law owns this vacuum. When I visit them, I cleantheir house...when i use this vacuum i always smell something burning. Then i knew the problem, it was on a low carpet setting. so i put it on the highest setting. (the carpets are really low and flat). Now it would be fine, but it wouldnt pick up anything, then the beater brush makes sqeeking sounds and burns up. Then when i use the attatchments, the hose keeps popping out of the vacuum!"
3,More mystery than romance!,"I was a bit disappointed in this story. I read Christian Romance for the romance but there wasn't much in this story. I found it to be more of a mystery than a romance novel. The hero and heroine don't even have any interaction until the 13th chapter which is half way through the book. I personally like more interaction and relationship building in my romances. That being said, it was well written and believable.My only other complaint is that there were so many characters that I had to keep a hand written list in order to keep track of who everyone was. Reading the first book is a must in order to understand who everyone is.These were my first Linda Chaikin books and I did like them enough to try more by her."
4,Worth Reading,"As always, any book by Linda Chaikin is worth reading at least twice. I liked this book, but I only gave it 4 stars b/c at the end the love connection happens a little to quickly for my taste. You wait the whole book for the 2 main characters to get together and then they are like...Oh I love you & I love you all of the sudden. It just happened funny. But, it was a great book and I love reading anything that Linda Chaikin writes."
2,Get a real refrigerator,"I've had this refrigerator/cooler (although when I bought it it was advertised as a refrigerator) for about a year. It's more of a cooler only...leave out refrigerator. It doesn't keep things cold at all just cool (believe me there's a big difference). I wouldn't recommend putting any perishable food in it...doesn't keep it cold enough. I just use it for water only...it won't even keep your beer cold enough. It is quiet and requires no care and it's inexpensive to run, but, spend the extra $10.00 bucks and buy a true refrigerator.."
1,Didn't last 5 months!,"DON'T BUY THIS OR ANY HAIER PRODUCT. Stopped working in less than 5 months. Would've been under warranty except it was a gift, and my friend paid cash at the time and can't find the receipt. Haier doesn't care they'll fix it for you for $140 hmmm that's more than it cost. Customer service is sketchy at best, first woman didn't even want to deal with me, so she just transferred be to the repair dept, who kept saying I could send it in for $140 minimum repair. Ridiculous. I Will NEVER buy a Haier product again. Whoever heard of a refrigerator that doesn't last 6 months.My sisters old one (another brand) that I gave her to take to college still works after handed down to me then to her. 20+ yrs still working. Haier 5 MONTHS.They're really a sad excuse for a company."
3,This is an electric cooler - NOT a refrigerator,"I bought this as a refrigerator (and it was advertised as such) to keep water and juice cold upstairs in the bedroom for use after exercising. (Yeah I know, after exercise I'm too lazy to go back downstairs to the real frig). This really is an electric cooler and as it states in the manual will cool items to 25 below room temperature. That means if you have it in a 80 room, the internal temperature will be 55. Don't store meat or dairy in this unit! In my air conditioned bedroom, juice and water are kept at 40, which is OK. It also runs continuously without cycling off. At least that is what I am observing based on the noise. I had originally set it next to the bed, but it made too much noise (whirring/whining) and I had to move it across the room. Now I think my wife wants to move it into another room.I bought this unit on sale for $49 and it is doing the job for which I bought it, but if I had to do it over, I would buy a real refrigerator."
5,Sturdy and attractive,"We bought four of these chairs a year ago, and they have been used on a daily basis. All of the chairs remain ""tight"" with no wobbling or loosening. The finish has also stood up perfectly. Overall, for the price, this is a great chair and we highly recommend it."
5,Sturdy chair(s) and a great value!,"When I compared this chair with the one it replaced,I found it to be of superior quality.The back of the chair isMade with a thicker,stronger wood and the chair overall weighs more.The finish is smooth with a nice satin gloss.As for value,I purchased my old chairs over 15 years ago and finding a price tag on the bottom of the seat,found that I paid more for the it than the new chair! It is important to note that these chairs are sold as a pair,not individually."
5,Well made product at a great price.,Picture is a good likeness of the actual product. Color and size was as expected. Arrived promptly and in good condition. Great price compared to similar products.
4,Windsor chairs,"Hi, it's a little early to submit a perfect review in regards to these chairs. I had the same ones for about 2 years and the did not last; I tried fixing, gluing, you name it. To be honest with you I haven't had these long enough to tell whether they are awesome or not. Bear with me and I will try to post another response in a timely manner, as long as they last."
1,low price means low quality,no instructions were provided. no tool was provided for the hardware. and one of the chairs is cracked. i would not recommend purchasing from this seller.
3,On th small side.,"I purchased these chairs to match missing chairs in a kitchen set. I didn't realize they would be so much smaller than the ones we were replacing. On the up side, we now comfortably fit 8 seats around the table with ease. On the down side, they are noticeably smaller than the arm chairs at the ends of the table. On the plus side they are well constructed and sturdy. They are comfortable for an average person and will accommodate smaller settings."
4,Very good chairs.,"I would have given them 5 stars, but I hardly give anything 5 stars. The color of these chairs is a bit lighter than my table, but they still look good. Very sturdy and it was great not having to put them together. They arrived in 2-3 days and were ready to use out of the box. I bought a set of 2 more right after I received the first two. Great deal!"
5,Very pleased,"We love these chairs. They arrived on schedule in fine condition. Best of all, as advertised, no assembly necessary. Open the box and to the table - great match. We've been sitting on them daily for about 6 weeks and they are quite comfortable."
5,Great deal!,"I ordered these chairs to put in a built-in desk area in my home. They came in perfect condition and look great. Very charming. As far as comfort, I bought seat cushions at Target and that solved that problem. As far as size, my kids mostly use these, so they're just perfect for them."
4,As Expected,"Saw reviews complaining about the comfort and durability of these chairs, and so far they are just fine. They arrived assembled, match and fit well with a 36"" table I stained natural, and have held up to my 250 lb husband as well as my 2-year-old tipping them over. Don't expect luxury, but for the price they are good little chairs. My only complaint is after they arrived and I decided I liked them enough to buy another 2, the price had gone up by $30."
4,They do their job!,"After looking for replacement kitchen chairs for my table, I was so happy to have found these chairs for a good price! I have seen the same chairs for $100 each chair and these were half the price for 2!!! I ordered them on a Wednesday and received them on Friday of the same week! Also, the quality was good and the chairs are very sturdy. So happy with my selection."
2,Small Chairs,"I should have listened to other reviewers. These chairs are tiny. I am 5'10"" and half my thigh was off the chair in the front. The width barely covered my tush. It was fine for my kids under 10 though."
5,Kitchen Chair Upgrade,"Bought these chairs to replace some broken ones. The chairs arrived when expected and turned out to be better chairs than I expected for the price. I may actually get a couple more soon. Great price, great product."
5,great chairs!!,"these chair arrived fully assembled---yaaay---- and are what was described in the listing. they seem to be very sturdy and well made. they are a little lighter colored than they look in the picture, which i like. i think they will last along time, even with the rough use they get when you have a bunch of kids around. long story short-- i love these chairs and will be ordering more soon."
5,Windsor Chairs,"Wonderful,wonderful,wonderful! Sturdy, beautiful, well made chairs.I don't know how they can afford to sell them at $35 each, no shippingcharges (I bought 2 sets) and no tax! When the boxes came, my mailmanhelped me bring them in. They were well packed and undamaged inany way. They were here in a very short time too. I highly recommend them!"
2,Winsome Wood Windsor Chair - 2,"The chairs arrived in good time, but one ofthe legs was chipped. I would not orderfrom this dealer again."
3,Agree these chairs are small,"I read the reviews that said these chairs were on the small side. We didn't think it would be a problem since we're not large people. We can deal with it. They're ok for our purposes, but I'm only 5'6"" (below average for a man) and I think they're a bit small. I don't understand why the manufacturer is making them this small unless it's because they're depending on people buying them based on the picture. If you are an average size man or larger, you don't want these chairs. The one advantage they have I guess is they will fit in smaller spaces. They're about the size you might expect for a bistro chair, which is unusual for a Windsor."
5,"Nice, sturdy chairs",These chairs are sturdier than what came with our oak table 11 years ago. I am quite pleased with them. I am ordering another set so that I will have four.
1,Poor shipping methods,"I have been unable to respond to the problem I had with order earlier than I would have liked to I believe I sent an email to the effect that I did not order this item but did not get a reply. When I noticed that this order was placed I contacted your customer help and was told that I could refuse it since it was days when the order was sent and to late to contact the seller. Since that day they arrived at my door I have not heard from Amazon, I did search dinning room chairs but when saw the amount wanted for shipping I decided not to order them. I would appreciate it if you could rectify this matter and refund the amount charge to my credit card. I have not received a response to any queries to date."
1,I wish i had looked at the reviews!,I wish i would have looked at the reviews for these chairs. They are very uncomfortable. They are very small so unless you are very small they will hurt your butt.Do not buy!
4,Initial feedback,"The chairs arrived in good condition and seem sturdy. However, they seem small (size of base). The color matches the natural finish and seems very close to whats displayed in the product description. The packaging was minimal and therefore it is at risk of getting damaged during transit. The installation was minimal."
5,You won't find better for less,"These are actually real nice chairs; I was nervous due to the low price. The only draw back, and its minor, is that the chairs have no caps on the legs. But for $3.00 you can buy some."
4,A fine chair,"I really ought to give Amazon five stars for having this item available. The chairs are a good value. The only negative is that the seat might be a bit short. We are using them in our cottage and they work very well. Even with all the wear and tear of a vacation cottage, they should last 5 to 10 years."
5,Great chairs!,"My family is enjoying these wooden chairs. They're comfortable, sturdy, and they add to the decor at our kitchen table. They brighten the whole room."
2,one of our great critics at her less than great,"I have followed religiously book by book by Helen Vendler, both the scholar and the critic of contemporary poetry, and, much as it saddens me to say it, my feeling is that the last few book have lost a great deal of the passion and intellectual acuity that I had grown to expect from her. Perhaps this is a natural consequence of age, though perhaps not an inevitable consequence, as one of her heroes, W. B. Yeats, has shown."
4,Gramophone Classical Good CD Guide 2002,"Like many, I have gone through various guides -- Penguin Guide, Rough Guide, Classic FM Guide, etc. -- and ended up buying this guide. It is not as comprehensive as Penguin Guide and perhaps not as easily laid out as Classic FM or Rough Guide. In my opinion, it is more detailed in terms of the selection the authors have picked in their guide, although it is more partial to European and especially British production. My lessons learned trying to build a classical CD collection using these guides is to buy a few of the recommendations from each book (or you may already have them in your collection) and buy the book that comes up with the choices of your liking. You will find that many of the recommendations by the guides are in agreement as well as many that aren't."
3,more of the same,"I like using using these books for reference( I have several years editions of this), however, it's quite obvious to me that there really isn't all that much change in the reviews, from year to year. I have the 1997,98,99,00,01, and 02 editions, and the lack of change from year to year is striking. What a rip! In my humble opinion, the Penguin Guides are so much better (although they also repeat much info, there are so many more recordings reviewed). One may also want to check out the Third Ear book on Classical Music recordings."
3,Probably not the best,"While I have the utmost respect for the work Alfred Deller and his consort did in early music before it was really fashionable, I really can't bring muyself to enjoy this recording because of the extremely wobbly soprano in the 4 and 5-part masses. It just seems totally out of place. Much better are the recordings by the Tallis Scholars and the Cardinall's Musick, this latter being my personal favourite."
2,Humidifier died after one use,"Received a bum unit, I turned on the humidifier, went to bed and woke up with it off. tried restarting, unplugging and repositioning unit and it never turned back on.Had to return if or refund."
3,Worked well but died too soon,"I got this humidifier in winter 2004. I used it for my baby's room the entire season. When it was working it worked very well, quiet enough and I like the digital humidistat and the timer. Never use the remote control. It's useless. Then I left it for 3 weeks when I was gone for vacation. I came back it died:-("
1,Dont Be Fooled by the positive reviews.,"I have had this unit for about 5 weeks. The power just died I can't turn the unit on. I cleaned every week folowing instructions exactly. I started to smell a burning smell like other people. And it died just like other people. I can't return it to the store because the have a 30 day return policy. I'm not gonna sped $30 to have it repaired, cause that is more than the unit is worth. and I can't seem to find a decent humidifier. So don't be fooled by the positive reviews, it is awfull. I would give it negative stars if possible. Next I am gonna try and take the unit apart to see if I can fix it. And I will never buy this brand again."
1,HORRIBLE AND ON MY 2ND UNIT.,"The first one broke, i returned it to the company under the warranty. They sent me a new one, and this one lasted a couple of months and now, it won't turn on. Furthermore, the heating elements builds up all kind of hard minerals and it becomes caked on the heating unit. Same with my old unit. No way to remove, they claim using vinegar but that doesn't work. Stay away from these units. Besides, i don't think Honeywell is going to give me a 3rd replacement."
4,misleading advertising/listing,"Overall, I'm happy with it (been almost 2 weeks), but they bill it as ""3 Gallons"" but as the other reviewer said, it is not a 3 Gallon Tank, but 3 Gallon output per day. It also says it is a dishwasher safe tank, but actually it is the medicine cup that is dishwasher safe - the directions clearly state to ONLY clean it with bleach.I still like it, and it works well, but sometimes I think the humidity reading is inaccurate (on the low side). I know my apartment is really dry, but it often can't even get up to 30% humidity, yet it feels quite tropical in the room..."
4,Quiet and effective,"This is a nice unit. Best feature is completely quiet operation. Worst feature is that the tank is hard to hold while filling. If you have a small sink or an odd shaped tub that requires you to hold the tank while filling, there is no easy way to do it except to put your fingers inside the tank to grip the tank.This is my first warm mist unit. compared to cool mist units, this is a lot more maintenance work, a lot more scale builds up each week which needs to be cleaned up every week. Cool mist units you just add antibacteria solution into the tank, and throw away the filter every two months."
1,Honeywell is bad news.,"I purchased the Honeywell warm-mist humidifier in December 2004. The machine died after 20 days. We only ran it at night and it worked fine until it died. The warranty is for five years. However, it costs $10 for a repair service fee in addition to the cost of shipping it to Massachussetts. After all that I may as well buy another humidifier. This time another brand."
3,Hard water warning,"This humidifier worked just great the first year that I owned it. I didn't have any problem with the hygrometer like other people have reported; the tank is easy to fill and carry; the unit is very quiet. I only use it while I'm sleeping and I could get 8 hours on ""HI"" setting, which was perfect. PROBLEM: If you have hard water, you will only get 1 year out of this model. The buildup on the heating element & reservoir is VERY hard to clean, and I had to clean it every other day. Last year the coating on the heating element started to wear off, which resulted in contaminated water vapor and burning odor when water ran low. This is the 2nd time I've had this problem with a warm-mist unit, so I am going to try an ultrasonic this time around. Heating element + hard water = bad news."
1,Avoid like the Avian Flu,"It works like a dream for a short period of time. Then the heating element gets caked and the unit starts to spit and sputter. This happens even if it is cleaned every week. It would be nice if the heating element were made of stainless steel or some smooth metal that from which mineral build up could be removed. It has a 5 year limited warrenty but I can't believe that one could last more than one winter. I have had 2 of these units but neglected the first one which died very quickly. I've cleaned the second one constantly but it still has a build up on the heating element after 1 month. I don't know how Honeywell can still be selling this unit. But worse than that HOW COULD I BE DUMB ENOUOGH TO BUY A SECOND ONE? It would be a decent product if the heating element could be bought seperately to replace the caked ones. Do not buy, steal or accept as a gift, even if you live in a rainforest."
1,Not worth the trouble.....,"I brought one last winter, I used it about 2 times before I put it in my closet because I didn't like the display. It always showed the wrong humidity level. I decided to keep it as a emergency replacement. I was using the Duracraft\Honeywell HWM2030 non stop in the winter time for about 3 or 4 yrs and it finally gave out on me. So I started using this unit again and after 2 wks worth of use it stop working on me, it want even turn on, the digital display just blinks and makes noise. Needlees to say I be buying a new Duracraft HWM2030."
2,its' alright,it is alrite...it done the job. the price is ok for the job that it is doing. not sure if it really help my skin or the dry in the condo. but i do know that i have to refill it twice a day !! once in the morning and once at night....so good luck
1,Do not buy this because ---,"The hygrometer is not accurate and indicate very high in the beginning.The number came down as it is used to the real value.Considering the price, I thought I should accept this.But it broke two weeks after I bought.So, I returned it and purchased Air-O-Swiss 7135 instead.I only have the AOS 7135 for three days but it is muche better than HWM255."
2,Inaccurate humidistat,"On the plus side, the unit is easy to clean (I use filtered water, which minimizes mineral buildup). The humidistat, however, does not work properly, so that I find myself waking up drenched in sweat -- I have it set for 60%, but it will get up to 75% or more before it cuts off. Just a while ago, it was reading 45%, while it was actually 70% in the room, so the problem appears to be getting worse. I really don't appreciate having the choice of being kept awake by my dried-out sinuses, or being tortured with excess humidity, so I am shopping for another machine."
2,Poor product,"Poorly designed, and in general, bad quality. I purchased two from separate retailers, and both stopped working -- one after 6 months and the other after about a year. The small tank also meant I ran it overnight, and had to fill it up every morning. Would not purchase again."
4,This is a replacement,I appreciated Amazon sent the replacement in very short time.I like the unit and has used it many times.It worked great.The water container is easy to remove.The bottom tray is easy to unassemble and clean.I hope this one last.
1,Garbage,"My new Honeywell HWM 255 3-Gallon Warm Moisture Humidifier lasted for about 4 days. It didn't put out much ""HOT AIR"", but it did work. Then it stopped, the electrical parts would not come on. I was suffering from a cold front, with my central heat set at 72, the humidity in my home was 20 percent. I had hoped that the HWM255 would solve my problem. Because of a bleeding nose, sore throat, very dry skin, I came up with a solution that works great and didn't cost me a penny, and builds up the muscles in my hands. I was about to toss away a empty hand spray bottle of Febreze. I filled it with water and spray it into every room. I point it high and by the time the spray hits my carpet, it has almost evaporated. I even mix a little Febreze with the water and it makes my house smell good. Thank you Honeywell."
2,"Great when it works, did not last past 2 years!","When it worked, and I had this for just under 2 years, it was great, the steam was nice, I used it to steam up my bathroom and my face, but when it stopped working (I think the fuse popped), I was so disheartened. I really expected a nice Honeywell product to last longer. Will not buy this again. Two years not long enough!"
1,Failed after one year,"It worked fine the first year and functionally very easy to use.After I tried to use it this year, I get a clicking sound and the display screen flashes erratically.Good funtion, lousy quality."
2,This is NOT a 3 gallon humidifier,"Similar to another customer, I was fooled by the deceptive product description. I also find the controls to be inconsistent. My previous Honeywell humidifier was excellent but now the quality appears to be in decline."
5,"Does the job, & quite too!","We had never owned or used a humidifier, but this winter we decided to give it a try. Glad we did, and so far we feel that this humidifier was a good value as it's doing the trick!"
2,Your Grandmothers Tango,This album is good for what it is- and as the previous review states the sound is awesome for recordings from 1930-40's. I was looking for something a little more soulful. If you want 1930's -40's sounding tango.. then this CD will suit you just fine. Not the best tango out there.
3,Just right for the coffee table,"I was tempted by the online excerpt from the book, so you can imagine my disappointment that what i had read was pretty much it - no depth, no probing, no analysis. If you wish that Parade magazine had a type column then this is your dream come true. Peppy short bio-interviews drawing a few pithy comments and then on to a spashy but mostly pointless sprinkle of images.Not a serious read or look. Save your money."
4,Good Insight,"This isn't a ""How you can do it"" book, but rather a ""How they do it"" book, or perhaps even more precisely, ""Why they do it"".This book profiles 12 contemporary type designers and shows on a personal level, why each typographer chose to do what he/she does and how they approach their work. Earls does what few other have in giving us personal insight (though be it brief) into the lives, minds and personal influences of well-known, and not-so-well-known, contemporary typographers--like Zuzanna Licko, Matthew Carter and Johnathan Hoefler.A few people missing that I would like to have seen included are: Neville Brody, Sumner Stone, Elliot Earls and the group at House Industries.If you're interested in learning something behind the surface of today's typography design, this book does have something to offer with a decent selection of typographers and (very brief) samples of their work."
4,This is a better description,"This is not a review, there was just a lack of information on this product, specifically the dimensions and type of canvas. I found the following description at [...]The Nato style Rucksack is a beautiful repro of the original NATO style rucksack backpack. This backpack is an ideal size bag for touring around town or around the world. The Nato Rucksacks are made of a 22oz heavy duty canvas, with one large main compartment with a draw corded closure and storm flap with a adjustable double buckle closure. The inside of the Nato Rucksack also has a pocket with a velcro closure with an exterior front of front pouch pocket with strap closures and there are two outside side pockets with strap closures. The Nato backpack has fully adjustable shoulder straps straps and a carry handle on top. Size:20"" x 14"" X 9""And now that I have dimensions, I will go ahead and order this product and update my review with my own comments later."
3,Awesome canvas material but the hardware is lacking.,"Like the headline says, the bag itself is okay. There are only a few problems that you have to deal with for it to be usable. One. Every single one of the buckles that hold straps onto the pockets are on backwards. Two. When you flip them around and are able to use the buckles, there is a slight bend in the metal of each one that won't allow the metal lead of the straps to go through easily. I took a pair of pliers and straightened them easily since the metal was so pliable, Three. There are two missing buckles on the bottom of the bag. I am not the only one to notice this missing hardware."
4,poor shipping time,"ordered rucksack 12/6/12 - received 1/3/13; recipient did not receive in time for Christmas-disappointed in seller.On the other hand, construction is beautiful; may be difficult to get to things due to the more complex front closure, i.e. if trying to get books/homework out in a hurry for classconcerned with how to clean this product properly since made of canvas material?"
4,Pretty good bag,"It seems to be holding up pretty well. The straps look like they could break fairly easy, but so far, they have not."
5,Best mushroom flavored pasta,"First, a little background on me. I have been hunting wild mushrooms in the Colorado Rockies since about 2000, so I know what great porcini mushrooms taste like. That earthy umami, almost musty, smell and flavor that you can smell from your pores after eating them... nothing quite like it. Well, I first bought this pasta from a store in Fort Collins, CO that specialized in select olive oils and vinegars, and didn't really hold out much hope that it would be anything special, but boy was I wrong. Cooked this up to al dente perfection and tossed with mild black olives, a homemade pesto, and topped with parm. regg., and this was revelatory! That great earthy porcini smell and flavor rang true and at just the right level to blend well with the pesto and cheese notes. Well worth the cost and shipping. Loved this so much I will be trying other flavors like saffron and black olive linguini."
5,better than given credit for . . .,"I know sometimes you can get a lemon but some of the reviews seem a little harsh. We have always used hoover vacuums and they have always been great. This one is no exception. It has great attatchments, is easy to use and does a great job of picking up dirt and debri. My older son who is always trying to take things apart managed to take off some screws that we could not find. We emailed to company and within a few days had the replacement parts at no cost. We have been very happy and have no complaints at all about this vacuum."
1,I wish this vacuum never came into my life,"I acquired this vacuum in 06. It was a wedding gift that replaced my husband's vacuum from the 1970's. I started having problems with this machine in the first few uses. The belt breaks constantly. I keep a large supply on hand. The on and off button broke. I have to unplug it to turn it on or off. It is heavy and hard to maneuver. When not in the upright position, the attachments fall out. The handle part where you grip the vacuum? The cap on the end falls off.The good things, the good things...It does a good job of telling you if the floor is still dirty. The bag is easy to change.Other than that, I wish I had kept the one from the 70's. I'm SO ANGRY at this particular vacuum, I will NEVER buy another Hoover because I am so disgusted they let this one come into existence."
1,Don't waste your money on this,"I bought this vacuum after waiting over a year for a new vacuum, I was so exciting to use it. In the store I tested it out and it worked great. When I brought it home, it did not suck up anything such as hair or lint (we have cats). If you have animals - DON'T BUY THIS ONE. Infact to use it and have it work, you have to use the hand hose. This is not really a vacuum cleaner if it can't even pick up the basics."
2,My first and last Hoover,"I've had my Orek since 1998 without any problems. I bought the Hoover Windtunnel Ultra Self-Propelled (on the recommendation of my sister and sister-in-law) 2 years ago, and this is the third time it needs to be serviced. The first two times it was under warranty -- the first time was because the carpet-height tabs broke off (which I was then told happens frequently); and then because the vacuum wasn't picking up. Not sure how they fixed it -- it may have been a belt.Now the Embedded dirt light is not working -- it's staying on red/dirty. It may be a gimmick-type feature, but I'd prefer that it work.Maybe the Orek has lasted so long because there aren't so many features. In any case, it's dependable, easy to use and light weight. The Hoover Windtunnel is VERY heavy -- if you're not using the self-propelled feature.One thing I will say...when it works, it does seem to work well."
1,I will never buy another Hoover,"Hoover used to be made by Maytag, and had great reputation.I bought this machine and at first was so happy.But the snake like pathway soon proved to be the achille's hill.After 4 or 5 uses, it will be clogged up and couldn't suck anymore.Then the motor died after only a year, just outside of warranty.At the repair shop, there were tons of hoover vaccum with the same problem.I paid $100 for the replacement motor , and it died after a month.In San Jose, there used to be two official Hoover Repair Center, they are both gone.I took the machine to another shop, and the mechanic there showed he too has too many to count repairs of Hoover to do.I gave up at that point and bought a German SeboX4.That is the best vaccum."
1,Do NOT buy this vacuum!,"I couldn't afford a Dyson or an Oreck, so we did our research and found Hoover to be next on the list. I have a bad back, so we even sprung for the self-propel feature. I used the vauum ten times and the belt broke along with the motor. It was still under warranty, so I called Hoover Customer Service. Their service is terrible! It took them over a month to respond to my calls, letters, and e-mails. In the end, they still weren't helpful and we took the vacuum back to the store.It had decent sucking power and was relatively easy to use. The weight made it hard to manuever and the fact that it kept tipping over whenever I used the attachments really got on my nerves.In my opinion, Hoover is no longer a name of quality and I don't recommend them for ANYTHING!"
2,Nothing like my old Hoover.,After a year of owning and using this vacuum we are very dissappointed in it. We have not had any brake downs like others but it just does not seem well designed. The unit is EXTREMELY LOUD especially when I am using the hose. The units tips easy when using the hose. Where the belt is to drive the brushes it does not pick up dirt so you have to retrace that step every time. I also have a lot of trouble with it trying to eat thinner carpets and other things I am trying to clean. We also have noticed the design flaws other have pointed out here. None of these things were a problem with the old Hoover Spirit which was a wonderful machine. The Windtunnel Supreme does clean very well with the exception noted above. We cannot return ours at this point but I would suggest you could do much better.
1,Waste of Time and Money,"Bought the Hoover Windtunnel Supreme two years ago. It performed okay for the first month or so. But the need to stop and unclog the hose, at least two or three times before I finish vacuuming, buying replacement belts for the power head (at least ten belts have been replaced in two years- my husband is a mechanic and he has a difficult time installing them)and the bags. As long as you change the bag before it is half-full, the vacuum will suck (if it isn't clogged). Both my sister and mother have this vacuum as well- all of us are looking for new vacuums to buy."
1,do not buy this vacuum!,"I own this vacuum and every time I try to use the attachment hose (without stretching it further than it can reach) the vacuum tips over on top of me. I have contacted Hoover and they appoliges for the ""poor design"" but stated there was nothing more they could do."
2,Worked great--for the first year.,"I bought this vacuum in April of 2002, and it was unbelievable. It vacuumed wonderfully, restored the pile of my carpet, and the self-propelled feature was great. However, about a year later that feature disappeared (I admit I wasn't paying too much attention, but I did notice what a workout it was to push), and around Christmas, I realized that the vacuum simply wasn't picking anything up anymore. I took the whole blasted thing apart, cleaned the brush, checked the belt, poked through the hose with a coathanger, and didn't find anything. I couldn't afford to have it fixed, and judging from the reviews, that would've cost more than buying another vacuum anyway! The vacuum was nearly $300 when I bought it, which is a hell of a lot of money to spend on less than two years' worth of use. If that's going to be the case, then I think I'll stick to the throwaway models for under $100."
2,"heavy, hard to push, does not roll well when not vacuuming","The unit is heavy and hard to push around. When not vacuuming and locked in upright mode, it is hard to move. A plastic piece scraps against the carpet when you tilt it and try to move it. The hose attachment have good suction, but it's reach is limited and it's hard to not move the whole vacuum by accident when using the hose."
2,Already broken,"I have only had this vacuum a year, I'm not crazy about it. The attachments have to be used in conjuction with a tube with a flap on it, and the flap broke off, now if I want to use the attachments I have to block the hole with my hand or watch everything shoot back out. It also keeps tipping over on me. Othewise ok,"
4,Great vacuum,"I just bought this at sears for the same price, and i love it. The dirt sensors are cool, the light turns from red to green when you have picked up all the dirt in an area. Simple to assemble, i did it by myself. It picked up the pile on my carpet well too, and it has a hard floor setting which worked well too. The only drawback is the short length of the hose, but there are two wands included for reaching. All in all a good buy for the money."
1,My first and last Hoover,"I've had my Orek since 1998 without any problems. I bought the Hoover Windtunnel (on the recommendation of my sister and sister-in-law) 2 years ago, and this is the third time it needs to be serviced. The first two times it was under warranty -- the first time was because the carpet-height tabs broke off (which I was then told happens frequently); and then because the vacuum wasn't picking up. Not sure how they fixed it -- it may have been a belt.Now the Embedded dirt light is not working -- it's staying on red/dirty. It may be a gimmick-type feature, but I'd prefer that it work.Maybe the Orek has lasted so long because there aren't so many features. In any case, it's dependable, easy to use and light weight."
2,Might be better off with another vacuum - especially with pets!,"I have had this vacuum for a few years and wish I had spent my money on something a little more powerful. I do think the red/green clean light is somewhat useful when it is red, but turns green much too quickly when the carpet is not dust or pethair free yet. I have a cat with soft fur and this vacuum is practically useless at picking it up no matter how many times I go over it. I have to use the attachments to get a better job, but as others have mentioned, the whole vacuum tips over after very little extension and the parts come off the hose easily.After vacuuming the same spot minutes after the green light was on, and after I thought it could pick up no more dirt, I vacuumed with another vacuum that amazed me on what was still on the carpet. Yuck!!!!I am finally looking for a new one that will actually clean my carpet."
4,No mess No fuss!,"What a great little gadget! Once my pancake batter is mixed, I simply pour some into the pancake dispenser and dispense it onto the hot griddle. No messy drips and cleanup is quick because I give it a good rince and toss it upsidedown into the dishwasher!Only thing I would change would be to make it a bit bigger."
1,Small and inconvenent for the money...,"I purchased this hoping to make pouring the pancake batter easier. Because of the mechanism on the top, it is too difficult to put the batter in the dispenser and the dispenser itself is much smaller than I anticipated. I returned it. While I thought I needed a ""gadget"", I bought a big measuring cup. I can mix and pour in the measuring cup, and it is MUCH easier to clean..."
4,Works great with pancake batter,"The dispenser makes nearly perfectly round pancakes every time. The longer you hold the trigger, the bigger the pancake. Make sure you do not put anything chunky in the batter, as it will get clogged up in the dispenser."
4,Stainless Steel Pancake Dispenser,"This item is very good for the price. However I would have liked the feature of ""metering"" out the product so the pancakes would all be the same size. You have to guess when to let go of the valve to attempt to achieve this.Otherwise its great."
4,Good but not great,"The pancake dispenser is a good, solidly made product. It puts out consistently even amounts and even has base to set the dispenser on when you're not using it. Just don't use any batter with nuts or chocolate chips, anything chunky. The opening is not large enough."
1,Dispenser opening too narrow,"I bought this dispenser for my husband because he is a pancake fanatic. His favorite recipe is for buttermilk pancakes. The batter is really thick and the opening at the bottom of the dispenser is too narrow to let the batter through. So be cautious before buying the dispenser - if your batter is pretty runny, then it should work. I suppose this means your pancakes are really flat. However, if your batter is more like cake batter for thick and fluffy pancakes, then pass.I gave one star since we haven't tried another recipe yet. However, I just can't imagine making pancakes with such runny batter to get through the dispenser."
5,great breakfast utensil,We bought this for my oldest son who loves all different kinds of pancakes. He absolutely loves it. I guess I need to get one for our household as well.
4,Totally Cool Trading Cards,"For those of us straddling both the academic and popular culture worlds, these cards are perfect. I didn't know all the theorists, though, but that's ok. If a few more sets of these were available then actual trading COULD happen and it would be awesome. ""My Deleuze for your Cixous!!"""
2,"For the price paid, I could have got something better.","The phone is cute, but that is where it really ends. The phone claims to have speed dial, it does if you only want to call your voice mail. If you want to send a text msg you have to set up an internet profile, which I still have not done becuase even with the help of the owner booklet, is impossible. The last thing would be ringtones-I know most people like the abrasive ones, but I like just a beep. Guess what? This phone does not have it."
1,Defective Battery?,"I have always purchased either, Nokia, Motorola, or Siemens so I thought I'd give Sony a try. The bronze color really caught my attention. However, I was VERY disappointed with the product. I charge the phone completely and within 16 hours, I am on only 1 block of power. I will be returning the phone and getting a refund, which of course, further frustrates me. Furthermore, and although the color is pretty, it does not appear sturdy. I would have settled for the less-than-resistant phone, but the battery, that is impossible to settl for!"
3,Good for 1st time moms for 1st few weeks,This is a nice book for a first time mom in those very early weeks when she is probably very nervous and unsure and might want a neutral source to refer to instead of listening to all the advice of well-meaning friends & family. After the first few months I rarely looked at it aqain though.
3,Not really a journal,"This book should not be called a journal as there is very little space for writing or personalization. It is basically an academic child development textbook that has been broken down into daily reading segments. I found that the segments were very repetitive and not that precise (stating things like ""sometime between week 3 and week 15, your baby should be able to do...""). Overall, it was not that helpful for recording memories or learning the developmental stages of my baby's life."
3,A little repetitious,"After using and loving the Pregnancy journal, I am slightly disappointed in the First Year Journal. The same information is repeated on many of the days. My baby is now 3 1/2 months old and I find myself writing in the journal but not even bothering to read the published information most days. However, the spiral binding and hard cover are nice, and it will be a nice keepsake for my baby when she gets older."
5,Baby's First are to be remembered,"This book was the best sequel to The pregnancy journal. We loved writing down all our babies first's and all her accomplishments. We were thrilled to find out there was another book that followed call The Toddler Years. Now that book is coming to an end and we are looking for another one to follow for the Preschool Years. We loved the information, the journal and the spaces for toddler drawings and tracing of hands and feet. We have also started to keep the same journals for our second baby and look forward to reading them in years to come."
1,Wishing I had not bought this book,"I bought both this book and the toddler book to write my childs memories down. I started using it for both my kids and realized that there was very little space to write things down when I needed to. I ended up writing over the text which I just stopped reading because it was not helpful at all and unorganized and was covered much better in other developmental books. To add to the frustration, there are cutesy quotes on EVERY page, and when there was a break in the develpmental jargon, they filled the space up with huge pointless graphics that they did not have the courtesy to make light enough to write over! Why call this a journal at all? I am cutting out the pages I did write in and starting over with another Journal. Dont waste your money."
4,really cool,"this journal is really cool. i loved the pregnancy journal, i used that as soon as we knew we were pregnant and i loved the format! so when i heard there was a baby one, i was excited to get it! it is a great place to take notes on your baby as he grows. a 'normal' journal just doesnt work when you are a new mother! so this is a really great item!"
5,Baby's First Year Journal : A Day-To-Day Guide to Your Baby's Development During the First Twelve Months,Excellent resource for new parents. Easy to quickly record something your baby is doing and see if they are on target. I used this for my first child and frequently buy it for new moms.
5,vision mexico,Me parece un libro extremadamente objetivo y bien documentado que relata la dura realidad de un pais vecino al pais mas poderoso del mundo
4,"Excellent references for Architects, a must-have book","I found many great referenced data on designing work space for my clients' projects, and also our new office. Can't work without this one. Excellent."
4,Bad print quality,A valuable and a must have book...but print and paper quality is not worth...it is very much like as if phocopied and binded...Yagmur TOPRAKLI
4,Great Reference,"I'm a graduate design architect, and i've been looking for a design standards reference. I came across this book, i've never heard about it before, as i was more familiar with Time Saver. But i was surprised by how good this book is and how sufficient the information contained is for all stages of design.The Time Saver Book might be more comprehensive in some aspects and may also have more examples of different building types. But the price of this book is very good compared to the time saver, which costs much more. I definitely recommend this book..."
3,CRITICISM,"I have been told that there was a review that said that there were errors in the book. This is certainly so, I should know, I am the editor! No reference book as comprehensive as this will ever be perfect. However, if you, the customer, finds one of these, please tell me. My e-mail address is David_Adler@compuserve.com. Thank you."
2,If it wasn't for all the oil.....,"This set seems adequate and a great deal for the price... I mean how much value add can there be to a gauge pin set, right? However...The problem with this set is that the pins all come they're each individually wrapped in paper and covered in oil. I'm sure this protects the pins from rusting while sitting in storage, which I appreciate, but if you want to use any of the pins you'll have to get busy unwrapping and de-greasing. That's a big pain in the ass that I don't want to deal with. Additionally I want to use these to test holes in parts that I can't have covered in oil, so I have to be extra careful in cleaning them. This makes the $60 not look like such a good deal after all. =(don"
4,Hoover Widepath review,"This vacuum cleaner picks up everything! I have a yellow lab that sheds and after I've vacuumed you would never know I had a dog. The only problems I have with it are that it is LOUD. Hope you don't have any sleeping babies. And the onboard cleaning tools dont always stay onboard (minor detail, I know). But all in all, it's a good vacuum cleaner!"
5,absoutely love it,This is well made. Clean. Arrived ahead of schedule. Gave as a gift. its beautiful. Love IT!!Would recommend vendor
5,durable,I have had and used mine for years and wanted to share the health benefits with family. Especially useful and necessary for travel but also for leaving one's toothbrush out in the home bathroom.
1,Started off great...then tanked!,"This product started off great. Then, within about 4 weeks, it would only come on if you shook it a little. Replaced the batteries. Worked great for a couple days, then would only come on with a little shake. Changed batteries again but still would only work if shaken a little. Now, completely dead after just 10 weeks."
3,"Works well, but doesn't last","Good news, it works well for the first 11 months and it apparently kills the bacteria. I haven't got a cold or sore throat in the last year, so this may have helped. The bad news is that this unit doesn't last. After 11 months it started to require a hard shake to turn it on and then it finally died. I think the moisture from the toothbrush and the vapor particles from the residual toothpaste are corrosive to the electronic components."
1,Junk Product,"Used the travel sanitizer just 3 times and it stopped working. Unfortunately, I received it as a gift for Christmas and didn't use it until vacation in April so it was past the 90 day warranty. The battery compartment is too large so the batteries are not making good contact with each other. Tried expanding the spring inside, but the spring is rusted out, which is really weird since I wiped the toothbrush off with a towel before putting it in the holder. Don't Waste your Money."
2,"Good, but not for long.","The Violight travel toothbrush sanitizer works well. So there's no reason to give it a bad rating for the actual use of it and what you're buying it for. However I find it hard to use it when after only a couple of months the UV light stops turning on the way it should. And in an even shorter amount of time after that it just completely stops working. I got about three and a half months use out of this item before it completely gave out. Is it the batteries? No. Is it the bulb? Possibly, but that wouldn't make sense with a statement from Violight saying that it is a ""lifetime bulb."" Either way, it's ridiculous.Spending $30 on this item isn't a big deal to me in the slightest. But with it's shoddy design (which I'm not even going to mention) and even more pathetic lifespan it isn't worth a tenth of that."
4,This thing EATS batteries ....,"At the rate it's going, it'll use about 50/year. And then there's always the nagging question ... did I buy snake oil? I can't think of anything else I own where there's NO evidence to tell if it's REALLY doing what it claims it's doing! So the reason for 4 stars? Blind faith, optimism and the high tech box."
5,Great Item Violight Travel Toothbrush Sanitizer,THis is a great item. Excellent protection for toothbrush!
1,Think about it for just a minute. These gizmos are absolutely useless.,"Think about it for just a minute. These gizmos are absolutely useless.(1) Anything that gets on your toothbrush head was ALREADY in your mouth. Unless you think your houseguests are cleaning their shoe soles with your toothbrush while you aren't looking.(2) You are sitting a wet toothbrush head in this gizmo. Which means it is sitting in a puddle of water that is likely to mold/mildew. So you can put mold/mildew INTO your mouth (that was NOT in your mouth before).(3) The puddle of water is likely to (a) rust out the innards of this gizmo and (b) short-circuit the gizmo's electronics.(4) The American Dental Association says these gizmos have no proven beneficial health benefits[...]Given all that, it seems your money would be better spent betting ""Hard 8"" at the Craps table in Vegas."
2,Not so good,"I bought this to take to Iraq. I would have to echo the reviews that state the product quits working after a few weeks. After about a week, I had to change the batteries. After 2 weeks, I had to start shaking it to get the light to turn on. Now, I'm just waiting for it to quit working all together. I haven't become sick of anything yet, so in that light the product works. Other than that, if you have other means to sanitize your toothbrush, use those instead."
2,Didn't realize it was a disposable product,I bought this product and used it for about six weeks before it stopped working even with new batteries. I just saw a review from someone who said she was on her third one. I think I will look for something that isn't disposable. Seems like a waste to me.
1,Poor Product,The case is big and bulky. The Violight stopped working after two trips. Save your money.
4,Great product!,"I have the stand up version as well, so using batteries was something I was used to. I take one batt out when I'm not using it. Great sanitizer as billed!"
5,"Good Product, makes sense",Really good product for what it is needed for. I would recommend it to others.
1,Buyer Beware - Stops working within 3 months,"Take heed to the negative reviews. I ignored them and I regret it dearly. Do not buy this product!Long story short. I bought this in April of 2012 by July 2012 product would not come on. I changed the batteries. It worked for a few days and then would go dead on me. After a month of running out and buying new batteries, the unit finally stopped working all together.I never dropped this unit nor had it submerged in water. I would ALWAYS shake my toothbrush vigorously before I put it in the unit. Still, this thing died on me. What a waste of money and time!"
1,Don't waste your $$$,After purchasing VIO200 used the saniatizer only twice when the clasp on the container broke. The container will not stay closed.
3,high battery usage,this product requires battery change after 2.5 weeks -- that seemed high to me --otherwise I like the product
1,Garbage!,"I would give this zero stars... but cannot. This product arrived and I installed new batteries and the unit is dead. It's always great to buy a product and have it not work right out of the box. Amazon is great with returns and makes it really easy, the only bright spot with this transaction."
3,Better Products On The Market,"I just received this product for a holiday gift and while I am sure it will sanitize your toothbrush as promised, there are a couple of hiccups that should sway your purchasing this model.The worst problem is that there is no ""on/off"" switch, you simply shut the case and six minutes later the violight is done working. This is problematic when you wish to take out the toothbrush and close it for a later use, the light comes back on and you are left to either a. keep the case open or b. remove the batteries after each use.Second, it is not nearly as small as the picture would indicate, and thus perhaps not the best travel companion."
5,wow,"very moving movie, didn't think i'd like it at first, but i did very much so. bebe neuwirth is fantastic in this film, should've been up for an award for sure!"
5,Enjoyable product,"My car was broken into several months ago, so I decided to buy the wrap. It has worked so well; it is better than other steering wheel binders since it has an alarm on it.Much cheaper than other conventional car alarms. A little bulky but it does the job. I really think thieves think twice when they see the huge thig on the steering wheel and the lights for the alarm. I am really glad I got this product here at amazon.com"
4,Live in current U.S. Car theft capitol (Fresno Calif.).,"This is the 2nd Wrap I own. Easy to mount and dismount. Highly visible. Fairly certain to lead the piece of crap car thief to someone else's vehicle. Remote control on/off switch big/bulky and difficult to put on a key ring because of a small pass through hole. Also goes through batteries fast (if you turn it on for the flashing light and alarm). Best to get rechargable batteries, you'll save a bundle in the long run and be green."
4,Maybe it's just me.,"I bought this product to protect a VERY valuable cargo on a long trip. My experience was that the thing fit my steering wheel so tightly that it could in no way slip. There is a trick in tightening it using your right hand and locking with the key in your left. FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS. As for breaking it, the stainless steel parts are reinforced by spage age plastic that racing car suspensions are made from. OK, my units alarm would trigger when I just wiped the windshield. The alarm is not loud but good enough to distract a guy jimmying it. I had no worry that my car would be messed with when I was in paying for gas. This product makes the Club... look like a club. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is that the Wrap is large and clumsy to store. I will keep mine in the garage until I really need it, and then I WILL use it."
5,Kipling Child Backpack,"This is my second ""child"" backpack although I am so not a child I wanted something with good storage and not too big. I am 5""1. I use it mainly for long walks with both of my dogs, the storage compartments are really nice I am able to carry their water canteen, tennis balls,my cell phone and a few extras. And very comfortable to carry, even with some weight. I highly recommend this product"
5,Very cute,I have seen a lot of pig figurines as my Mom collects them and this is definitely one of the cuter ones. It is beautifully made and any pig figurine collector would love it. It arrived in a nice oval shaped box-perfect for gift giving. It probably measures about 3 inches in length and 2.5 inches in height.
3,Poor binding mars otherwise terrific book,"A beautiful book filled with beautiful pictures of beautiful (and bizarre) Japanese toys. What more could one ask for? Well, how about a book that stays in one piece for more than 30 minutes. After less than half an hour of gentle reading the wraparound cover became unglued from the rest of the book. I'll glue the cover back on and cross my fingers nothing else comes loose, but this is a hassle, and not the first time such a thing has happened with a Chronicle Book: my copy of Eric Kohler's ""In the Groove"" found itself ""In the Trash"" soon after both cover and pages came loose from the el-cheapo glue binding. Message to Chronicle Books: it's the 21st Century, and high time books be bound to last more than a day. Either have your current printer improve his binding, or get a new printer. And yes, I'd be willing to pay a little more for better binding. My rating: content = 5 stars, presentation = 1 star."
2,Not so crazy after all...,"I wanted to like this book, I really did. Those of you expecting an in-depth look at Japanese toys (namely vinyl figures and robot/robot-like things) won't find much here to chew on. It's a quick ten minute flip through, and then you'll probably throw it on a shelf and forget about it. The pictures are pretty but honestly, the toys chosen to be included here are rather boring. Not crazy at all. There's a miliion interesting toys out there, and I'm left scratching my head as to why the handful of examples included here were deemed ""interesting"" enough for inclusion. That being said, it's not even a good ""starter book"" for newbies as the toys shown fail to ignite much interest or awe beyond the occasional titter. It's not a bad book per se, but it is in NO WAY ""the"" book which fans of the genre have been waiting so long to see..."
5,Gorgeous windchime is a delight to both the ear and the eye!,I love this windchime. The sound of it in the wind is not overwhelming and loud but soft and very relaxing! The colors have not faded with exposure to the elements. The glass panels are of substantial thickness and not easily broken. I would buy this item again!!
5,"""Do Yourself A Favor...""","I remember the first time that I heard this cd. Wow! So lush, so alive, so dense with life. The arrangements so excited me that it took a few listenings to really ""hear"" Sarah. Now that could be interpreted as not being complimentary, but in this instance, it is. Then I really started to ""hear"" Sarah...<smile>. Has there ever really been a better overall singer? The air is thin, and the people are few at this altitude. Do yourself a favor, and get this and ""I Love Brazil."" After living with these for awhile, you too will be enveloped in a ""Brazilian Romance."""
4,Simple truths illustrated with a story!,"""I know It When I See It"" by John Guaspari provides simple truths about quality that are illustrated with a fable. These truths should be self evident but like a lot of truths in the business world self evident is not always understood and certainly not always applied.The following are some important takeaways from ""I Know It When I See It"".1. Prevention is better than inspection.2. ""Your customers are in a perfect position to tell you about quality, because that's all they're really buying. They are not buying a product. They're buying your assurances that they expectations for the product will be met.""This book can be read in less than twenty minutes. You could find fault with it's simplicity, but for the most part quality is simple. The discipline to follow the simple truths is where the challenge lies.Dr. James T. Brown PMP PE CSPAuthor, The Handbook of Program Management"
2,The War Between the Classes,"I think that the main topic of the book,""The War Between the Classes"" by Gloria D. Miklowitz,the differences between the various classes is an important theme,but Mrs Miklowitz wrote it too boring.In my view our teacher gave it to us,because it is easy to read.There aren't much difficult sentences or words.So it`s good for young pupils and for those who aren`t good in englisch.In some ways it is interesting,for example the various characters which change in the time.But on the other hand there is this love story like Romeo and Juliet where everybody know what would happen.But all in all I wouldn`t recommend it to other students,because in my opinion there are a lot of better books which handle with this problems."
1,Not That Good,"Though it may teach about racial prejudices, this book focuses too much on a love between two people. The girl in the book, Amy, obeys her boyfriend as though he is God. Even though she the author makes it seem as though she is getting her own life back, in the end she still does the same thing. What sort of story is this. It makes it look like women are inferior to men!"
4,The War Between the Classes,The author is trying to say that nothing good comes from prejudice against another person. It teaches how prejudices can effect the people who are being hurt by it. I would definitely recommend this book. I think that it is full of life lessons that everyone should be aware of. This book shows the hardships of different ethnicities and different social classes. It shows what it would be like to have someone you love be a different ethnicity. It also shows what it would be like to have someone you love in a different social class. I thought that it was a really good book. I think the people who would enjoy this book the most would be teens around the ages of 14 to about 17.
2,The War Between the Classes,"I think that this problem ""racial discrimination"" is very important but Ms Miklowitz wrote the novel ""The War Between the Classes"" in a very boring way.This novel isn't difficult to understand and there are also interesting ways but there are only a few.Because of this reasons I wouldn't recommend this book other students and I think there are books with the same issuses which are more interesting to read."
2,The war Between the Classes,"""The war between the classes"" is a book about racial and sexual discrimination.My opinion is that this novel is nothing else then a mixture of ""the wave"" and a great lovestory.Amy,a japanese girl,wants to be free from her parents and from a japanese tradition,but her father don't shows any empathy for her feelings.The second main charakter is Adam.He's anupper-class boy without any predjudices about people with other tradition or lifestyle.The rest of the book is-as i said before-a mixture of""the Wave"" and a romantic story with happy end."
2,The War BetweenTheClasses,"The book deals with racial and sexual discrimination.Amy and Adam,the main characters,play at school the color game ,which devide the class into different social classes.The minorities are the Oranges and the inferior color is Blue."
2,for pre-teens only,"I was made to read this book as a senior in high school, for all high school teachers reading this, please do not make 17 and 18 year olds read this. It is written for 10-13 year olds, and at our level this kind of book makes me cringe with irritation because of the level of writing. I and my peers just finished Hamlet for god's sakes and then we are made to read this. It is a good book for pre-teens, but for all you teachers, please teach this book to the age group it was meant for. I just wanted all teachers to know this. It is good for pre-teens but utterly annoying for higher level readers who read Ayn Rand for fun."
2,Could have been good,"this book was nothing more than a good idea warped into a boring love story and a preachy message. The whole idea of the color game was a very original idea, but the overemphasized love plot made the book seem almost trashy. The japenese parents were displayed very well, but the rest of the characters were predictible and one-sided. The end was predictable as well, and many of the good non-prejudice ideas the author was trying to write were buried underneath a phony plot and were exagerated. The book could have been good, but in the end, i was dying for it to be done. Sorry, just wasn't good enough."
2,A chore,Awkward positioning of attachments and short hose hampers cleaning effort. Very difficult finding replacement hepa filters!
4,What did my last vacuum do?,"We didn't know if we really needed a new vacuum cleaner, but we grew tired of buying replacement bags ( that we had to special order cause the vacuum was so old). After using our new Hoover for the first time we realized what we were missing. What had our old vacuum cleaner been picking up? It picked up so much more dirt than our old vacuum and you can tell when it needs to be emptied. A very good value for the price."
2,A Hoover disappointment,"We bought this vacuum after getting married and getting our new house. Although it picked up a lot of dirt (the thing was full after vacuuming our 2 bedroom apartment!), it was an absolute pain to empty. The filter was always dirty, and the canister was not easy to empty. There was always remaining residue, and we generally ended up getting the dirt everywhere.The kicker was that the belt broke, and we have only had the vacuum for seven months. We are planning on returning this one and getting a different, cheaper vacuum that is hopefully less trouble."
1,Needs repair after a year,"A little more than a year after I purchased this vacuum, it's eating the belts. I was offered the extended warranty by the salesperson, who commented, ""I've seen the repair rates on these."" Alas, I declined. As another reviewer has mentioned, this vacuum is always covered in dust. Given a choice now, I'd waste a bit of paper and buy a bag model. Finally, I regret not looking for a vacuum without a HEPA filter since it's another thing to clean and buy. I'm not so obsessed with what's in my carpet that I need one."
2,Not worth it for a Hoover,"Very surprised at how disappointed we are with this machine. After reading other reviews, I have the same exact complaints. Terrible on hard floors (spits dust and particles back out), horrendous to empty (be sure you are outside, it is truly a mess.) There is a layer of dirt/dust on the outside of the machine constantly (even after you empty and wipe it down, after the next vacuuming-it is filthy again). My real issue lies with the ""Hepa filter"" selling point of this machine, it actually causes MORE dirt and dust to release into the air than a ""Non-hepa"" filter machine, so whats the point? I expected this machine to be very good, not the best as I know Hoover has better models. But, I would take my old ""bag of dirt"" vacuum over this bagless model anyday. Save your money."
4,I really like it,"I bought mine last week and so far so good. I also have [another]bagless and the dirt clings around the filter in the canister I had to use a chop stick to get into the canister to clean it out, the Hoover I just take the top off and all the dirt falls into the garbage the mess from the Hoover is nothing compared to the [other one]. The only thing in comparing the two that I like about the [other one] better was that when I an going around furniture the Hoover does not turn as easily, except for that I like the Hoover alot better."
1,near worthless,"It's amazing that a company whose rep is based on it's vacuums would sell such a unit. When I had to go over the areas I vacuumed in order to pick up what was remaining on the floor, what use was it except for the possible dust that was found in the container? When approaching Hoover about this, their recommendation was to return the unit. So I did."
2,"No suction power, makes a mess","I've had this vacuum for over a year because I spent $200 on it, but I've had enough and will finally give it the boot. It's a mess to empty, a pain to clean the filter's 100 crevices. On a bare floor you can just see the dirt being pushed in front of the vac or coming out the back. I've held up the hose one inch from a single dog hair, it will not pick it up. On top of that it's heavy and loud."
1,Poor quality unlike Hoover~,We purchased this vacuum based on the performance in the store. We liked the idea of seeing what was being picked up. However we did notice in the store the display model was covered with a layer of dirt/dust. When we questioned wether this was normal we were assured it wasn't. Well lets say this was extremely common and we found our cleaner looking just like the display within a very short time. Because of it's power and suction we decided to live with it and wipe the cleaner down often. We also find that if you go down a small step while the cleaner is running it blows dust everywhere. The filter and the canister are disasterous to clean as well. It seems as though we handle dirt more with the bagless then we ever did with our previous cleaners. Unfortunatly this is one vacuum I'd never reccomend and regret purchasing it. Needless to say we are now looking for a less hassle cleaner vacuum.
1,A good idea if you only vacuum up marbles...,"This vacuum is awful. We recieved it as a wedding gift and have used it for a while. Bagless vacuums are a bad, bad idea. If you have pet hair or dust in your home it will all fly back out at you when you empty the canister.I've found that this vacuum does not adequately pick up pet hair, even when I go over the same spot many times. I'll be buying a new (bagged) vacuum very soon."
3,Not worth the money,You will be changing belts every month... and cleaning the dir tube every couple of months... + u will see the dirt .. yummy...It will pick up dirt very well though.... get will get stuck if u have carpet with lot of hair...
4,"Fun, original and hearty New Orleans blues...","What I love about this album is its eclecticism and its irresistable funkiness. From Maria Muldaur's crooning voice on ""Bayou Sunset"" to the smooth R&B sounds of ""New Lover"", this album delivers fully satisfying tunes that keep you guessing, while staying true to bluesy funk. Thanks to the everpresent, yet appropriately centerstaged or behind the scenes (front and center on ""Show Me Your Pretties"" in a frolicking raunchy Mardi Gras classic; more behind the scenes on tunes like ""New Lover"")talent of bandleader Rockin' Jake, this album is eminently listenable for all ages and crowds. Jake's harmonica is one of the best sounds in New Orleans blues these days, the golden thread running through this strong, multi-faceted album."
5,GREAT FOR BIRTHDAY GOODIE-BAGS,I gave these out as part of my 1 year old daughters birthday party goodiepags. They are not expensive - and they are a great alternative to candy and cheep little toys that are broken in a few days. . . . .
3,Long Term Psychodynamic Psychotherapy,The book is well written and helpful for any mental health professional even if we differ with some of the issues presented.
1,Dreadful,"Dreadful.Characters were 1 dimensional, ideas were lackluster, read as poor copy of the much better Demon Download books by Jack Yeovil/Kim Newman.Dull.Terrible.Dreadful."
1,"Unfortunately, I was just plain - Bored!","I liked the sound of this novel, but just couldn't get into the character, nor the world.I was simply lost. Do you have to play a stupid board or video game first? I just wanted, and expected, to have a solid reading experience.Didn't happen."
1,Poorly written and uninformative,"This piece of junk found its way to my garbage can not long after buying it. I've had great success with the ""For Dummies"" series in acquiring computer application knowledge, so figured that this book could replicate that success in a scientific field. That was not the case.Cartoon-based, this book is more properly called cartoonish. It explains genetics poorly, if at all, and makes over-generalizations, too simplistic analogies, and dull, plodding stabs at bringing this interesting field to light. Definitely a pass for any serious reader, dilettante, or the idly curious."
1,Do not waste your $$$!,"This book is filled with inaccuracies and oversimplifications; you will be dumber after reading it. I can't even say it's dated because the inaccurate content was well known information years before the publication date. I feel sorry for all of those, like myself, who were duped into buying this garbage. I feel even worse for those who rated it so highly. People, your knowledge of genetics is now WRONG!"
3,"Fun, but not doesn't cover more than the basics","I purchased this book to review the basics of genetics, mostly to be able to sound more knowledgeable than my pre-med significant other. I was very dissapointed to find that the book covered fundamentally the same material I remembered seeing as a freshman in high school 15 years ago. Not only has it not been updated to reflect the explosion in genetics, it basically covers the same fundametals one has gotten in a basic high school course. If you didn't understand it then, this book will help, otherwise it will just give you an interesting hour or two. I love Larry Gonick's other works (especially the History of the Universe series), but this one just doesn't measure up."
5,basic genetics,"this book is an excellent resource for someone teaching and reviewing basic genetics. Although it misses out on recent udates and findings, it still paints the basics in comical, very simple and straight forward approaches. My friend is taking her preliminary exam in Genetics and when i lent her this book to help her recap old courses, she couldn't be more pleased by the easiness, and freshness this book brought to her studies. I am currently teaching fundamental genetics and i made it clear to my students that this is the last resort for those ith no hope of understanding genetics.. it works..!"
5,A terrific book,"""The Cartoon Guide to Genetics"" is one of my favorite books. When I was told I had to co-author ""The Complete Idiot's Guide to Decoding Your Genes,"" Larry Gonick's book was one of the first ones that I picked up. It demystified genetics and made what could have been boring into an exciting, humorous subject. A real winner."
2,TOO basic,"Book was WAY too basic for the undergrad level. if you are in highschool, this should be very beneficial or doing intro biology. but other than that, its too basic in explaining. the only thing is goes into good amount of detail is DNA replication, transcription and translation."
5,Oops! You've done it!,"Two days ago, I thought I had a great idea. Now I see you've not just conceived the great idea, you've already executed it. GREAT! That leaves just one thing - to read your book/s!"
2,WHAT WAS I THINKING?!,"When I first read the reviews, I thought I'll try almost anything once. Talk about regret. I was amazed with the oral hygiene scene,the white plastic chairs in the overstretched intro were pretty scary. I need a lobotomy!"
3,Wishing this were a must-read book.,"The concept is good; the execution is not. Rich with lush full-color stills from the movies under review, the book is eye candy times ten. The problem comes with the synopses: they are often tepid and shallow. The odd typo (astronaut John Glenn is cited as ""John Glen"") and the repeated, puzzling collapse of ""no one"" into ""noone"" make for interesting reading. (Should English pop relic Peter Noone now be called ""Peter No one""?)Still, the films are divided into genres, making for interesting and quick comparisons, and the choices are intriquing, with a dash of foreign films thrown in where warranted. If you are a rabid movie fan, can get this at a good price on Amazon (and last I checked, you could), it might be worth a look."
4,Very good scale. Body fat indicator is soso.,"The body weight scale has been reliable and accurate. The scale itself is well-built, sturdy and attractive. The body-fat indicator is a bit erratic."
4,A great Resource to get your Service built fast,"A good book that is a valuable resource to quickly get your NT Service built. Good service control example code and explanations. Event Log examples and basic MSMQ examples. Example code needs to be modified to add MFC and CSocket support. If it had that, then I would have given it 5 stars."
5,Right on target!,"This book addresses all the issues related to such complex problems as NT Services. The author explains them in very great details, and makes you understand how all this works. The sample code works and you can use the classes from the book to start coding NT Services very fast. The author is very talented in explaining difficult concepts. Funny enough, this book has the best explanation on MSMQ, as well as apartments. As an alternative to the classes provided in this book, I recommend the CodeGuru NT Service C++ wizard written by Joerg Koenig. But even with a wizard, it is good to know how all this works."
4,"A ""Steptastic"" single!","I love this song! The original version is awesome, but this CD has two remixes of the title track! The W.I.P. mix leaves a lot to be desired, but the wickedly awesome Sleazesister's Anthem Mix is the best Steps remix-ever! Period. This song is like a virus, once it casts you in it's spell, you can't get rid of it, not that you would want to! Plus, the video really captures the song!"
4,Steps are aawesome!,"I think this cd was really excellent! For those of you that love all of Steps music, you will definately love this one. It has a great upbeat with just the beautiful arrangement of everyone's voices. All of the styles are good but my favorite and probably the most popular is the radio edit. It's too bad that steps aren't all that popular around the world."
3,Cat Scratch Fever,"There were no dimensions provided by the seller, so the item was larger than anticipated. I have to break it in half in order for it to fit into the available space."
4,Ken Le Huray,"Donna Leon's creation of Guido Brunetti detective of Venice is one of the great figures of the genre. His family and the city of Venice are equally realisic. ""A Noble Radiance"" is full of the corrupt and aristocratic background of that city. The interplay of characters in the story is first class."
4,"Consistent, intelligent mysteries","This is another of Donna Leon's wonderful Comissario Guido Brunetti mysteries set in Venice. While some of them are slightly better than others, each is a solid, pleasurable, intelligent read. And Guido is a ""best of breed"" police inspector with humor, a conscience, and frustration with the corruption of the ruling powers in and around Venice."
4,Seedy Venice,"I have grown to like the Leon books about crime in Venice a great deal. They are a pleasure to read. Nice pace, not too fast or slow."
3,Not the author's best but still absorbing,"I found some of the family relationships and background confusing at first, but once I'd sorted them out the story moved well enough. The ending was not as satisfying as most of the novels in this series but Brunetti and his family and the city they live in are always absorbing."
1,We miss you Anna Fields!,"Anna Fields (her real name was Kate Fleming) read the first six audio books in Donna Leon's excellent series. Her voices, her pacing, her inflections, made all of the characters -- male and female -- live for me. I learned recently that she died on December 14, 2006, when a flash flood trapped her in her Seattle studio. Guido Brunetti, Paola, Senorina Elletra, and the rest will never be the same. They are being voiced by a man with a British accent, who makes Italians sound like Cockneys. Do Italians pronounce it Loo-tenant or Left-tenant? It is Left for this new reader, and it is incredibly annoying. We miss you Anna! Rest in peace!Oh, the story Donna Leon writes in this installment is excellent. As always. Just get us a new reader!"
4,very good album,"This is the fourth Wings album, and third chart-topper, too. It is better than Wild Life or Red Rose Speedway, but not as good as Band On The Run. This one has 3 Top 40 hits, including the catchy chart-topper ""Listen To What The Man Said"" with saxophonist Tom Scott. The disc kicks off with ""Venus and Mars,"" which explodes into ""Rock Show."" This album is more varied than previous Wings albums, with the 30's-ish ""You Gave Me The Answer"", the mournful ""Love in Song"", and the bluesy ""Medicine Jar"" and ""Letting Go."" It has ""Magneto and Titanium Man"", which is about the former's comic books which Paul was reading. The album's only low point is ""Treat Her Gently/Lonely Old People,"" a mushy ballad that procedes the ""Crossroads"" Theme.(Which by the way is a British TV show's theme.) It may sound overproduced at parts, but is worth the time and money. The bonus tracks another to get excited over, but the album itself rocks."
3,Better than Plastic Ono Band,"I think McCartney was the better composer of the Beatles (but why does one always have to make a choice. Their post-Beatles work proves my poin, generally. However, I agree with most dissenters that Paul cuold be somewhat uneven in his output as well. This album is a case in point. Quite a few tracks would not sound out of place had Lennon played on hem on a Beatles album, but some are minor disasters.I wish McCartney wold take a little more risk on his solo albums. His life did not depend on commercial success, I think. Band on the run and Flaming Pie are the two essential McCartney albums, together with his 90's live albums."
2,Skip the DTS version,"I won't address the songs themselves, but this DTS version is a novelty item at best. The instruments come through as half bright and half muddy and the DTS recording engineer, no doubt named Todd or Dave, seemed to think it was funny to move the voices around from speaker to speaker to speaker in classic ""Hey, watch this; this is cool"" mode. Bad call, Ripley. I just hope the remastered CD sounds better than this. I would not buy it again."
3,Wings do Sgt.Peppers,"To me this is the concept album of the Wings era. Rock Show, a seventies song about performance like Sgt Pepper's opening track and You Gave Me The Answer, the vaudeville, When I'm 64. No where near as succinct as SPLHC Band but it is Macca at his grooviest."
2,Back to the bargain bin,"This was one of those albums you could get for [a low price] in the cut out section. After reading the reviews on Amazon, I thought I had missed out on a gem.WRONGFor a lousy [low price] I could have saved a small fortune.This was bargain material when it came out and now it is expensive. The 5.1 surround mix is at best, amateur.The music is surprisingly mediocre.This DTS surround recording only makes bad music more annoying.If you want to experience DTS music get almost anything else."
4,Try the live version...,"Surprisingly, most of the songs on this CD are also on the live CD ""Wings Over America"" and sound better live. Especially Venus and Mars and Rock Show. Those two were made to be played before and enthusiastic live audience. I don't go to rock concerts that much anymore. It seems that the raw energy isn't there like it was in the seventies when rock concerts ruled. We are so distracted by the hyer-pace of the fast life today, that we can't even sit down and listen to a CD in its entirety. Where did we go wrong? :-)This CD has a lot of genuine and very creative music on it. But for those who are neophytes, I would suggest ""Band On The Run"" or ""Ram"" two of McCartney's best albums with the Wings."
5,This CD is alright tonight!,"This was one of their #1 records.I will tell you why.""Venus and Mars/Rockshow"" is a hit and a rocker.""Love in song"" is a nice slow song.""You gave me the answer"" is a song dedicated to Fred Astaire. Another rocker is ""Magneto and Titanium Man"". Denny Laine sings ""Spirits of ancient Egypt"", another good. ""Medicine Jar"" is another rocker sung by lead guitarist, Jimmy McCulloch. That song is my favorite song beacause I love Jimmy McCulloch's music. ""Call me back again"" is a slow rocker. ""Listen to what the man said"" is a big hit. ""Treat her gently"" is a slow number featuring piano. Plus bonus tracks like ""Zoo Gang"",""Lunch Box/Odd Sods"" and ""My Carnival"".Buy this CD."
5,"""...Venus and Mars are alright tonight...""","This is one of Paul's greatest albums - at least the songs on there that he wrote himself. The album starts out great and keeps on going 'til you get to track 8 which is ""Spirits of Ancient Egypt"". The only part of this song that I like is when Paul and a few others harmonize on the chorus. I don't listen to ""Medicine Jar""...in my humble opinion it's not a very good song. ""Crossroads Theme"" is good. I have the gold version of this album which has the extra tracks on it (which, by accident, I ran over with the car after having it for only a few weeks...luckily the CD is OK and it was only the neat-o case that I busted...but I still walked away happy!).""Zoo Gang"" and Lunchbox/Odd Sox"" are good instrumentals. ""My Carnival"" is a great little song to listen to. If you're starting out a McCartney collection - DEFINETLY add this one to your collection - it's a must!! :)"
4,"Solid Follow-Up to ""Band on the Run""","""Venus and Mars"" finds Paul McCartney and Wings riding the crest of a phenomenal wave after their ""Band on the Run"" breakthrough. The 1975 album rocks harder than its predecessor, but is less cohesive due to the self-indulgence of ""Medicine Jar"" and ""Magneto and Titanium Man."" Nevertheless, McCartney and Wings deliver a rousing ""Rock Show,"" along with the dynamic ""Letting Go,"" a bluesy ""Call Me Back Again"" and the hit single ""Listen to What the Man Said."" In terms of Beatle nostalgia, ""You Gave Me the Answer"" harks back to the glory days of ""When I'm Sixty-Four."" Overall, ""Venus and Mars"" is far superior to the group's erratic 1976-79 studio recordings. The out-of-print CD version contains three memorable bonus tracks: the B-sides ""Lunch Box/Odd Sox,"" ""My Carnival"" and ""Zoo Gang"" (an instrumental theme to the short-lived British TV series)."
3,"Interesting premise, too juvenile for my tastes.","This would be a good book to give to a child about 10 years old to get them into science fiction. As an adult work, it falls short. I didn't find anything particularly remarkable about the book, and the characters all seemed very flat to me. I like Hogan's other works, but this one didn't leave me satisfied at all, as I'd guessed the surprise ending about a third of the way through the book. It compares to Heinlein's Podykane of Mars in terms of it's target audience, in my opinion."
5,This is one of James P. Hogan's best works.,"This novel is light reading that carries a nice and innocent story line and concludes with a beautiful ending. Marvelous introduction of secondary players in mechanical entities that serve as analysts of the main character, Taya. It was easy to get into and I wasn't able to put the book down until I finished it."
2,"boring, confusing and complicated","This book was pretty boring and confusing and complicated all jumbled together, in my opinion. I haven't finished the book yet but it's going to take me some time to because it's really weird- i think the author used too many big words. It didn't have much of a plot and no offense, but I can't say I found it too interesting. The only reason I'm reading it right now is because I have to do a science-fiction book report and it's due soon so I can't really get another book. As you can see, I'm not a big fan of science-fiction. I was reading it and I'd gotton into the middle of the of the third part, when I was like,""oh my god, I have no clue what the story is about!"" and so I ended up starting all over again from the beginning. Now I'm reading it and reading it very very s l o w because what Mr. Hogan had to say takes awhile to sink in. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone."
5,A book for every level of expertise!,"I marvel at people who can look at a shoebox, a stack of postage stamps, a roll of ribbon, a glue stick and see potential. I am not one of those people and that is why Memory Crafting is such a treasure! With this book someone as craft deficient as me can create beautiful boxes, pillows, pin cushions and even music boxes with my own two hands! Judi Kauffman offers inspiring ideas on how to individualize each project, not to mention exceptionally clear instructions, which is important for a total beginner like myself. In addition to the sheer usefulness of this book (now I won't panic when my niece and nephew visit and the rental movies run out!), I'd like to mention its incredible design. Stunning photographs show us the details that lift the projects from the level of mundane craft to homemade art, and the good-sized charts and diagrams are a welcome relief for middle-aged eyes. Buy this book for your friends, for your scout troop, for your church group. I did!"
2,this book was disappointing,"I was disappointed with this book because I did not get excited about any of the projects. Some projects were O.K., but most of them required me to get back online and order expessive supplies. I don't mind if a few projects require materials that are not easily obtained, but many if not most of the projects in this book required items that would need to be ordered.I counted about 60 projects,most of the others were variations of the 60 projects."
1,"Pretty, but not sterling.","These are wicked pretty, but not sterling. My ears were infected by these within a few hours...which only happens when they aren't real!"
5,power chewer toy,This is absolutely the best toy ever for our power chewing lab. We stuff it will treats and it keeps him busy until he is panting and worn out. So far it is still intact too. Great investment!
2,"High Hopes, but it didn't pull through","We had high hopes for the orka ball after the great reviews. Our Terrier mix is a ball lover to the extreme! This ball lasted a couple of weeks and then he was able to start chewing it apart near the hole. It's a wonderful ball because it's a slightly larger size than average which means it doesn't roll under the couch, and it is very light weight. It also bounces really well which Pete loved! Unfortunately, it didn't last long enough to get a good review from us, especially considering it was a pretty high priced dog toy. If you have an extreme chewer, I would look elsewhere!"
5,Eddie resurrected,"Rasputia is a mean, cruel and fat bitch. Mr. Wong is a rude, blunt, racist and cool asian; and Norbit is soft, naive, weak but brave in the end. This movie is good, and is really funny (The Latimores are wickedly comic!). Ha ha ha. No more to say. Good for Eddie Murphy.I think the people that put one star for this one, are fat people with no sense of humor."
3,pure fun,eddie murphy still has it.. he is a true comic master of disguise and norbit is a perfect springboard for his talents... do not expect too much in terms of plot and you will not be dissapointed.. simply a very funny movie with the character Rasputia (murphy) getting most of the laughs.. nothing wrong with a good laugh!
3,"Murphy's great,but the story needs something more","First of all,I can't believe Cuba Gooding played such a small stupid part in ""Norbit.""This great actors talent is so wasted in this Murhpy comedy.Eddie is Great as always taking on 3 roles,especially Rasputia.Some parts are very funny,I have never laughted so hard in my life,but Rasputia is too evil for a comedy,and Norbit is too much like Forest Gump."
3,"BETTER THAN I EXPECTED ! ,BUT NOT GREAT!","I have always liked Eddie Murphy even though he has had his share of bad movies. 'Norbit' is not his best movie nor is it his worst movie. I found myself liking this movie a little more as it went along. It's not great by any stretch but, it's not nearly as bad as I had heard. I guess my expectations were lowered and it allowed me to enjoy this for what it is. A dumb romantic comedy with some good performances. Once again Eddie plays multiple characters and the make-up by Rick Baker in incredible. I wouldn't buy it unless it was in a bargin bin, but if it's on the tube........?"
4,oscar material it is not...,"...it is more ""eddie murphy"" and we all know what that means. but, boy, did i enjoy the color feast this movie offers in hi-def! kudos to eddie for shooting a movie that looks stunning in hd format. does have a mediocre script but i'll buy it for its ""looks"". simply great!!!"
3,Really Wasn't That Bad...,"I liked this movie suprisingly. Actually the only charachter I DIDN'T like was Norbit. Everyone else was funny in their own way. Terry Crews was hilarious as usual and Rasputia set it off. I think Eddie got a bad rap for this film because it was no where near as bad as the reviews made it out to be. I laughed almost throughout the movie. You have to check out my other reviews to see that I'm not easily impressed. I don't regret buying this. I'll echo what someone else said, the movie could have done without Kat Williams and Eddie Griffin. Having them in the movie did absolutely nothing for the film. Cuba Gooding had a couple of funny moments also.Overall this was a good movie. I gae it a 3 because like I said I didn't like the charachter Norbit. I just can't imagine any black man who behaves this way. And I know some nerdy black guys!"
4,"Very, Very Funny!","I read somewhere that This movie was considered the worst movie of the year. Some people just don't get it! I don't just mean this movie, they don't get it period! My wife is a big fan of comedies so we go see just about anything that looks interesting. Some of her favorites are: Anchorman, Blades of Glory, Nacho Libre, Dodgeball, and now Norbit. We laughed so hard during this movie that we hardly ate our popcorn. Raspucia (I hope I spelled it right) is one of Eddie Murphy's best characters ever. There's a scene where she's scantily clad and washing a car with the song ""My milkshake brings all the boys to the yard"". I was laughing so hard, I was in tears. Anybody who doesn't think this movie is funny just doesn't have a sense of humor."
1,"If Eddie Murphy, a once great talent...","...keeps putting out crap like this, I predict his movie career will soon be referred to in the past tense. This is just awful, somewhere between a human acted cartoon and tripe. The first fifteen or so minutes have a couple of laughs, from there it goes straight downhill. This is so bad it's not even worth the time to watch it if you somehow acquired it for nothing. I always loved Eddie Murphy, and I know no one can hit a homerun every time out, but this just blows chunks, sucks, you fill in whatever appropriate phrase you'd like. Avoid it like a mother-in-law with a rent bill in her hand."
1,horrible movie.......NOTHING funny at all about it,"eddie murphy stooped way low when he made this movie....it has slapstick and silly scenes but NOTHING is memorable or even entertaining humor and leaves the person wondering if it will get funny later on, which NEVER happensresputia is also played by eddie murphy and that role is outrageous and derogatory of overweight people without being the slightest bit entertainingthe storyline in this movie is almost lacking and VERY predictable. When a love triangle appears, one may expect a jerry springer twist which actually might have salvaged the movie, but instead it only makes predictable and low brow humor leaving this movie way in the bottomhands down worst eddie murphy movie IMO"
1,sickening,"My stepsister wanted to see this movie for her birthday when it was first in theaters. My father dragged me along even though I asked if I could see Bridge to terabithia while they watched Norbit. I could tell from the trailer and commercials that it was going to be an unpleasant film. I have never seen anything more disturbing, more disgusting than this movie. The portrayal of obesse women is sickening. Most of the jokes in the film are horrifying. There is the dreadful scene where Rasputia attempts to run the neighbor's dog over, resulting with the dog being crippled. Rasputia also threatens to burn kate with acid. The movie is not funny but an ugly portrayal of society. The only good parts in the movie were Kate and Norbit playing wedding as kids and actually getting married as adults. Never watch this movie. There are so many better comedies out there. Do not even waste time renting it. YOu will regret it."
1,Sucks!!!!!,I recieved the movie but it does not play at all very dissapppinted. I have tried it n other dvd players and it keeps sayin bab disc. There is no scratches on the Cd itself. My children really wantd to watch Norbit.
1,this video sucked!,see the title of this review! #thatisall - I got the dvd in the mail (in a timely manner) put it into my dvd player and it would not play (side note - this was a BRAND NEW dvd player) all my other dvd's worked except for this one - do not buy from this buyer!!!!!! this is a warning!
2,Norbit movie,Eddie Murphy is very funny in almost anything he plays. This is another movie where he plays multiple characters. There were some funny lines but not enough to make me label this movie a comedy. Rubber chicken type humor which isn't my type. Disappointing to say the least and sometimes annoying.
4,what a talent,"eddie murphy is one the best talents of our time,this may not be his best work,like the nutty proffesor,but funny as hell,"
2,"Poor, lost, deluded Eddie",Leave it to Eddie Murphy to address a subject like domestic violence and take all the humor out of it. It's a shame he wasn't taken from us by a homicidal transvestite in the mid 80's so we could remember him as the comedic genius he was.
1,disappointed,"i love eddie murphy but this dvd definitely wasn't what i expected.i was disatisfied from the start.first of all no one should ever call any baby ugly,for seconds,a man could be sensitive without being a complete wuss,and third ,i felt that plus size women were made to look like domineering trash with bad taste in clothes.just because you are a plus size woman doesn't mean you can't be classy.ps not all of us are bullies either..."
4,Hilarious,"""Norbit"" its hilarious a must see film a little manless guy married to a women that is enough man for the both of them and everyone in the small town fights to keep her man from his long lost soul mate who only wants to better the homeles kids ITS A MUST SEE"
4,I laughed out loud!!,This was funny and it hit every stereotype hard.This is not one of Eddie Murphy's best films.But it's as entertaining as is bad to the bone.
3,Not one of Eddie's Best,I was looking forward to seeing Norbit as I'm an Eddie Murphy fan and the movie was suppose to be funny. Let me say that I was a little disappointed. This movie was not as funny as I thought it would be and certainly not one of Murphy's best.Rose DesRochersNorbit (Full Screen)
3,Norbit,"Weel, Eddie Murphy is a genius in playing few rolls in the same movie. Especially with a fat siut on. Altough the film had some good moments, it wasn't as funny as i fought it would be. But for Eddie's hard work Norbit deserves those 3 stars. Oh, and one last thing. I would really apreciate if someone from the managment would write what the special features have to offer. Please write about the special features to avery new movie you' ve got on your website. Thank you.Oh, and if I made some mistakes in maywriting, then sorry I'm polish.Mark"
5,Eddie Murphy is amazing.,"Eddie Murphy is an amazing actor. I played both character well, and it is super funny. I highly recommend the seller and the product."
2,Norbit,"I love Eddie Murphy in all his movies except Norbit, all I can say is it was just okay to be honest it is nothing to write about so there I said it."
4,Hilarious!,"Laughed non-stop! ""How you durin?!"" Eddie Murphy at his finest! If you love to laugh... Norbit is the movie! Go Norbit, its you birthday!"
3,Eddie Murphy Style!!!!,"When I first watched it, I didn't laugh very much. By the second or third time my boyfriend and I started randomly quoting lines from the movie and falling out!!!! Yes, Rasputia is beastly and mean-spirited, but I ended up buying this movie because at any point in the movie, there's something hilarious going on or being said. It's meant to be crass, folks. She's ghetto fabulous!"
2,This movie was bored!!!,"This movie was bored and I watched whole movie some misunderstand it. Also the story was bad and some scenes was fun, however it isn't good as other movies. Just I saw one time."
1,This movie stinks,"When I saw the previews for Norbit, I mentioned to my wife I might want to see it. She shook her head and told me to see it without her. I waited until it came out on video, spent the $.50 to rent it from the library, and watched it one evening by myself. As usual, my wife was correct. This movie stunk. It is not funny or interesting. The characters play to all the same stereotypes. I can't believe anyone thinks Eddie Murphy should spend countless hours in the makeup chair to play such idiotic roles. I couldn't get Norbit's annoying voice out of my head for two days. Don't waste your time or money on this horrible movie."
1,Terrible movie. Wish I could give it a -1000000000,Don't rent or buy this movie. I thought I have seen the worst but this is by far the lowest of the lowest crapp I have ever seen. It is true what they say about Oscar curse because of Cuba Gooding's acting role in this film. The movie is down right stupid. The storyline is corny and unreal. Terrible in every way. This is Eddie Murphy's worst. The good thing I can say is there would be no movie that can be worst than this film.
4,JUST A GOOD TIME..........,"Eddie Murphy stars many times over in this ribald comedy about a timid, backward, geeky orphan who grows up and marries his childhood protector--a loud, overbearing and overweight woman named Rasputia with an overblown opinion of herself. When Kate, Norbit's first love who grew up in the orphanage with him returns to town in an effort to save the town's orphanage, she has no idea that her fiancee has conspired with Rasputia's brothers to steal the orphanage from her in order to open a topless bar....meanwhile, the philandering Rasputia suspects Kate and Norbit of having an affair.Crude but funny and at times grossly stereotypical, Murphy displays his acting range once again by playing a variety of different characters. If you're looking for a good laugh and a whole lot of fun, this movie is the ticket.DYB"
1,A Disaster of the Highest Order,"Viewers must be starved for comedy to endure Eddie Murphy's wretched tour-de-farce. Makeup wizard Rick Baker is the real star of ""Norbit"" - allowing Murphy to portray a variety of characters with diminishing results. After his standout performance in ""Dreamgirls,"" it's appalling that Murphy (who co-wrote this fiasco) would squander his talents in such a grotesque fashion. Furthermore, he doesn't need elaborate makeup to showcase his versatility. Skip this comic nightmare and revisit Murphy's brilliant work on ""Saturday Night Live."""
4,lot's of laugh,had some real funny parts not one of Eddie Murphy best but still lots of laughter.. enjoyed it have to watch it a couple time so you catch what was missed the first time ...
3,Funny,"Luv norbit, very funny movie. Eddie Murphy does it again with his ability to portray several people in a film. Awesome!"
1,Review purchases,I could not play it on my dvd player even though I have HDTV. I need a regular version please.
2,Norbit's wife copied from another comic,Am I the only one who thinks Rashfusha is a rip-off of Shirley Q. Liquor? And the girlfriend is trying to be a black Ally McBeal?
1,Norbit review,"When I ordered this item, I did not realize that it is not playable on anything but a HD DVD player. Which no one has. I can't even use it."
1,Norbit,I received the DVD and it will not work. An error screen continues to show up. I believe the DVD is blank. I would like a new DVD sent that works. Totally ripped off.
5,Norbit,It was the funniest movie ever I want to watch it over and over again. You have got to see this movie it is really fantastic. It came exactly 2 weeks after I had ordered it.
1,Did anyone actually think this would be a good movie?,"Honestly. You could tell just from the previews it was going to be just god awful. Ooh, what a brilliant plot: a dorky nerd has a dominating fat girlfriend, and the movie will be about his attempt to liberate himself from her clutches. You can predict every fat black woman stereotype a minute before it actually occurs on screen. And as for those who are wowwed by the whole multiple-character thing Murphy does, it's really not that novel of an idea. He's done it many times before, and really it's not that impressive. The man's an actor, he should be able to play different characters! It's kind of the definition of his job.More reminiscent of ""Pluto Nash"" than any of Eddie Murphy's good movies, Norbit is a dismal failure that I am embarrassed to have seen. There is no reason to see movie. Poke your eyes out with a sharp stick rather than view this dull, cliche, tired train wreck."
1,a complete let down,"i really wanted to like this movie but...............im sorry, this was not a good movie at all!eddie murphy was more funny in dreamgirls then this terrible garbage!i mean,how many times do we all want to keep seeing him in fat suits!"
3,Norbit (bluray),"This movie did not recieve great reviews from the box office, however, if you enjoy movies such as ""Little Man"" then you will love this comedy. Eddie Murphy is hysterical as he was in the, ""Nutty Professor"". I enjoy this movie every time I watch it."
3,How YOU donin? Kinda cute,"Eddie Murphy, after years of floundering back and forth between a failed action movie and singing career, came back with a formula that worked for him - a remake with extreme special effects make up. He discovered this with Coming To America, came back with the Nutty Professor, and attempted to do it again with Norbit. The previous efforts were funnier, but this was a good time without so many fart jokes.Eddie Murphy plays three main characters in this movie, a broad comedy about a nerdy, nervous orphan named Norbit. He wants to do good things in the world, combating with his shrew of a wife, Rasputina, and her family of brother, the town heavies. THey are secretly plotting to tear down the orphanage where Norbit grew up and build a strip club. It goes into a series of screwball comedy antics and fat jokes with the special make up. It's raunchy, not for little kids by any means, but a good time."
1,"Weak Movie, Not Very Funny!",How can a movie where Eddie Murphy plays all of the main roles not be funny? Ask the producers of this movie! Norbit is the story of a loser orphan (eddie murphy) who is bullied into marrying a fat african american lady (eddie murphy). The marriage is one of convenience and when Norbit reunites with his childhood love chaos ensues. You would think this would be a funny movie but they do not pull it off well at all. Its very obvious where the laughs are supposed to be but the comedy is forced and just isn't very funny. The movie isn't as charming as the 'Nutty Professor' and isnt as funny as 'Coming To America.' This is a movie you can definetly skip on your to-watch list.
1,EDDIGOTASTIC!!!,"Not funny, just a regular poorly scripted, crunch them out hollywood film staring 90% of the cast of Eddie Murphy. Oh, how I miss the days of Beverly Hills Cop and Coming to America.Only worth watching was cameo of Marlon Wayans.Two Thumbs way down."
4,Great book. But you may need something newer.,"This book it's a must have. Really interesting most of the things it contains, other are rather basic.I felt I was reading a rather old book. It'd better talk about new J2EE technologies. Great book anyway."
1,way to small,"although great for its price, this necklace is meant for a child, not an adult. Go with something else."
5,Here's a track list,"1. Wait And Bleed (Terry Date Mix) 2. Spit It Out (Overcaffinated Hyper Version) 3. (sic) (Molt-Injected Mix) The Wait And Bleed remix can also be found on the Scream 3 soundtrack. The Spit It Out version here is the demo version, with way cooler vocals and guitar chords. The (sic) remix isn't really a remix, mostly just dummed-down vocals and a drum intro at the beginning, but (sic) is a great song, so it's all good. All-in-all, this is a great single."
4,Slipknot does it again!,"It's not easy living off the same 14 songs. Ask Slipknot. Since November '99, they have been making remixes and live versions of their prized tracks. Well, this particular remix is solely for the collector and those who want ""more of the same"" and fear Slipknot will change their style when the new LP is released, like the Insane Clown Posse have done.I'm both!"
1,How do they sing with those oversized sishkabob heads?,LOL!Nirvana pwnts them and their not even metal.Alternative >>> Crappy Metal
4,jess's review,"this book was the best! everytime sabrina travels through time its cool. with dragons, knights and magic it seemed so real!!!"
3,Not impressed,"I am probably the only one that was not impressed by the performance of this product. Perhaps it just doesnt work on my carpet which is Stainmaster Dupont Ultralife (small berber-type style). It did clean up 'traffic areas' but did not get out some spots I had here and there. My carpet is 4 years old and needed some touch ups. The stair tool feature got the dirt out, but still shows traffic patterns and when the carpet dried, it felt crunchy. I tried it on ceramic and it did not clean the grout as claimed by others. Perhaps I need to pretreat it. It does not say if I can use this on laminate floors, but I tried it anyway and that DID work. It's very heavy and very LOUD. I am going to keep it however and will use it on upholstery and in my car. Overall, performance not as great as I thought."
2,Plan on getting it servced,"I purchased this product hoping to keep our near-white carpet maintained. It worked for a while. The problem was that that dirt and hair (that the vacuum cleaner missed) would clog the machine in multiple locations, some of which could be disassembled and cleaned by the consumer. Thankfully, we now have hardwoods. I would recommend researching area dealers to find out if these can be professionally serviced (cleaned out) by someone in your area. I can't even detect where all the gunk lies that causes the carpet cleaner to stop sucking up the water it discharges."
5,Better than a rental,"I absolutely love this cleaner. Having 2 dogs, 3 kids (including twin 3-year-old boys) and lots of entertaining, my off-white carpets get dirty pretty often. This machine is amazing. It has removed not only dirt, but blood, juice, mud, accident stains from the dogs (both, if you know what I mean)...My two gripes about it is that the receiving tank is small. For every fill up of the fill tank, you have to dump the receiving tank twice. If you can afford an extra tank, go for it (or if you know someone who has the same machine, borrow the tank). It makes the job go faster without having to run to dump it every so often. The other complaint--the upholstery cleaner part isn't the best so I use a hand held cleaning machine for that purpose."
4,Great cleaner,The only problem I had with my cleaner was the hose getting a hole in it. If you are careful to not stress it I would imagine it wouldn't break as quickly but I fear it will still break eventually as I have talked to a few other owners and they have all had the same problem. It is the best cleaner I have found. After mine broke I bought a bissell and have been very dissatisfied. I will be buying a hoover this time! It's got great suction and good cleaning power brushes.
5,Pleasantly Surprised,"This is the first carpet steamer I've owned. I considered purchasing a Bissell but was turned off by the low ratings in the reviews. After lots of comparisons, I chose this Hoover. I've only used it once so far, but it seems a great value for the money.I cannot believe the amount of CRUD it removed from the carpet!!! The waste water was absolutely appalling but proof that it did a great job. In fact, it did a better job than ANY cleaners I've rented from the hardware store or anyone I've hired. The suction is good and the floors dried much faster than I anticipated, for which my cat is also thankful :) I can't wait to try it on the upholstery.I wish the tanks were bigger, but they are so easy to attach/detach that it's not a big deal. And bigger tanks = added weight. I think the switch for the brush speed could have been made a little beefier, but I can overlook that since I'm impressed with the overall performance.You can't go wrong with this one!"
5,Awesome cleaning machine!!,"This model works great. From spills, to cleaning furniture. This machine can do it all and is very easy to learn how to use. My grandpa even bought one. I recommend this machine to anyone that wants clean carpets and wants something easy to learn to use."
4,"Great Carpet Cleaner, but Heavy",Great carpet cleaner.. used mine only a few times and my carpet is starting to look newer. One bad thing is that it's quite heavy with the water in it.. so be careful using the attatchment on the stairs. Other than that.. its easy to fill and empty water tanks. And the hoover cleaning solution leaves the room smelling fresh and sneeze-free (from allergens).
1,Save your money,"Although Hoover promotes this as being one of the best,don't be fooled. Made almost entirely of plastic, one can't even look at it without it breaking or falling apart. Used my three times and can say that I regret spending all that money for such a piece of junk. Can't get Hoover to take care of it and they make you wait on the phone(no 800 customer service number)forever. I'm going to purchase another carpet cleaner, it appears, but not from Hoover. Want to get taken to the cleaners? Buy from Hoover."
5,"Our Finest Day: D-Day, June 6, 1944","Our Finest Day: D-Day, June 6, 1944A friend lent me a copy of this rather short book before I decided to order two copies, one for another friend and one for myself. It's unique, as it includes reproductions of letters, a map, The New York Times front page announcing the invasion, directions for arming (or disarming!) a hand grenade, etc. I'm pleased I have it. The seller packaging was very good, as was the condition of the book."
5,Timely book for those who want to communicate better,"Storytelling in business is a subject that's been popping up in the business media, so this book is timely. Evelyn Clark makes a strong case for the importance of using stories if you're a leader who wants to get your point across. She demonstrates her point by telling stories about a lot of well-known companies and explaining how they use stories and why they believe in it. It's an easy book to read because each chapter is about a different company, so you can read just one at a time and come back to it several days or weeks later without losing the train of thought. The appendices include a checklist for evaluating your entire communication program and templates for developing your own stories so you can put the lessons to work. There's also data on several studies that confirm the value of storytelling in the workplace. I highly recommend Around the Corporate Campfire if you want other people to listen to you and remember what you said!"
3,Helpful but not sufficeint .,This book contains questions and answers only. No explaination for answers is given. I found this book useful to get idea about the kind of questions that will be asked in the FPGEE. I recommend that you combine this book with Comprehensive Pharmacy Review.
3,Good to use with Comprehensive pharmacy review,It's definitely helpful but only after you've read the essential reference books. It may not offer any explanations but going through it will give the student preparing for FPGEE a chance to test adequacy of knowledge.
3,one of the best books,"one of the best books for the FPGEE , contains hundreds of questions , which is subdivided in categories , it practise you on the real exam , I think every one must have this book for the FPGEE"
3,SICK,This book does have a very sexy girl in it but she gets raped in a very violent way. If you like watching women get raped then you will love this book. It also has alot of demons in it with a sexual connotation. The artist does know how to draw a womens body but the story line is rather sick and morbid with Druuna having sexual adventures with monsters. A very sick book. I would say the only thing good about it is that the artist knows how to draw a women.
1,Works Awesome...for a month or so.,"I had high hopes for this machine, especially considering the price. If ""you get what you pay for"" then you're paying about $200 more than you should. After a month or so the brush-belt will slip and burn up the pump assembly. I changed mine myself for about $40. After a few more months it wont properly dispense cleaning fluid. It's now sitting in a landfill somewhere.Dont get it. Find something else or just use the rentals."
1,Highly prone to failure,"We purchased one of these units a couple years ago now. We used it all of 5 times over the last 2 years and it broke down 3 of those 5 times. Two of those breakdowns required us to go out and rent a unit to finish the job.The main problem with them is the cheap plastic parts used for the beater bar mechanism. This is the major mechanical work area and is subject to stress, heat and friction that is simply incompatible with plastic parts.The very first time we used it, the plastic gear that meshes with the belt stripped and it had to be replaced (under the warranty fortunately). The 3rd time we used it, the belt broke and we replaced it ourselves with the included spare. The 5th and last time we used it, the swing arm that holds the beater bar melted and welded itself to the beater bar. Both had to be replaced. This is a 60% failure rate! So I highly advise you look elsewhere for a carpet cleaner. I wouldn't recommend this thing to anyone."
1,Don't waste your money or time...go with the Hoover!,"We bought the Bissell ProHeat thinking it would be great. The first problem is the tank in tank storage. The seal on the bottom broke within the first month we had it. After contacting Bissell they informed me that I could buy a new tank for $17. I bought that and it was leaking after 2 months. Not to mention that the tank is hard to empty and get fully clean. There was always dirt and junk left in the tank!! About that time I started noticing that the machine was leaving pieces of black plastic on the carpet. The machine was chewing up it's own gears and not doing a thing for my carpet. We have white carpet, a naughty dog, and a one year old child so we are very dependant on our steam cleaner. We ditched the Bissell and purchased a Hoover. I am more than pleased with the new machine. It is easy to use, easy to clean, stays clean, and gets our carpet cleaner than the Bissell ProHeat ever did. I would never consider a Bissell product again!"
1,Works great until cheap plastic parts break,"I was thrilled with this machine for about 10 uses, - it cleans great and the carpet was almost completely dry when I was finished. Today, after vacuuming the whole house and moving furniture in preparation for carpet cleaning, I discovered that a chintzy little plastic part that holds the belt that drives the brush broke. You can't replace just that part, even though it is easily removed. The entire machine has to be disassembled to replace the entire pump assembly! Bissell says it has to go to a service center to get the work done. That is 1.5 hours away from me! I talked to the service center, and they will sell me the parts for $40, but assured me that disasembling the entire machine will drive me crazy. The service center's advice was never buy a Bissell, buy a Hoover instead! That is what I plan to do, because this machine is full of other plastic parts just waiting to break."
1,flimsy drive gear on brush,The drive gear for the brush is very small and plastic. The outside rim snapped off after 8 uses. There doesn't seem to be any way to replace the gear myself.
3,Flimsy - Don't move it like a vacuum.,"The plastic parts don't hold up very well when it is loaded with water. The lock in the hinge was the first to break when I tried to tilt it with a full dirty water tank. Then the suction lip broke off when get caught at a corner. The internal hose connecting the motor and the dirty water tank broke the next. The 90 degree range of movement is a little too much for such a tiny section of hose.It appears to me the designers of the steamvac do not use it much themselves. The upright vacuum format, while convenient, is not the best format for a steamvac that can be 50+ pounds when loaded."
1,Same as the rest..works when it works,In the shop twice and now broke again for the last time. Won't pump water. Owned it one year and ready to give Bissell the finger. Buyer beware.
3,does a good job,I am on my second bissell pro heat cleaner. The first one lasted about 6 months before something went wrong but I loved what a great job the steamer did I exchanged it for the exact same one. I have now had the second one approximately 6 months and am having problems again with the machine. I am debating on trying one more time.
2,More trouble than helpful,"I bought this machine in hopes of being able to clean my carpets without the hassle of renting a machine or paying someone to clean my carpets. What I got was a machine that completed two rooms, then quit working. By the time, I would have paid for the labor and the parts to repair it, the cost of the machine would have doubled. I'm giving it to a friend that likes to tinker. Maybe he will have better luck with it. I could have had my whole house cleaned twice by a professional for the price of repairing the machine. However, when the machine did work, it did an excellent job. For the kind of money you are paying for a machine, it should be dependable for a much longer period of time. In the future, I will cross the Bissell name off of my shopping list."
1,Very Fragile!,The brush is very sensitive to dog hair. I paid $70 to have the unit repaired and was able to use it two times before the brush broke due to dog hair...
1,love it new hate it used,"the best new after 6 or more uses it stars to fail. Bissell must have people put in rave reviews because i have met 4 people in 4 different places who had the same experience i had. Bissell will only stall, they know it is bad, but would rather ROB the consumer. 200$ you throw away, run from Bissell"
2,Wonderful until it stopped working,"I bought one unit and loved it. The ease of use, cleaning capability, and compact storage (I'd had a model that had hoses and hookups all over the place before) were huge pluses.After a year the pump stopped working. I haven't had it repaired, yet, so I don't know how much that's going to set me back.In the meantime, I bought another, thinking the first was just a lemon. I got it in February, and used it last evening for awhile, and tried to finish the job I started today, and it, too, seems to have something wrong with the pump.I am extremely disappointed."
1,I agree with the other reviews - not reliable!,"I agree with many of the other reviews -- when this machine works, it does the job fairly well. However, it is not well-built and mine failed just after the warranty ran out, after only 4 uses. Repair is $50 per hour in our area and I don't want to invest more in a machine that I think is not well-engineered or well-made. Consumer Reports rates the Hoover ahead of the Bissell, but just slightly. I'm not sure they have perfected this technology!"
3,My experience,"Just a few problems so far, but cleans well on average....I find that it doesn't remove most actual stains per say, but it does make the overall appearance of the carpet look much better.With 2 dogs, I found that pet hair accumulates underneath the roller brush, and you have to remove a mat of wet nasty dog hair after a small section of carpet (yes I vacuumed beforehand). If you don't remove the wet hair, it prevents the nozzles from spraying properly.Also, my SMARTMIX dial doesn't work anymore. Whether or not the soap bottle is in the machine or not, it still dispenses only water....so there must be a clog somewhere....in the meantime, I have just removed the soap bottle and pre-mix my solution in the tank."
3,Something new breaks every time I use it,Purchased product 1 year ago and used it three times since. Each time I used it something broke. Rotating brush broke so machine cannot be pushed on carpet. Pickup of clean hot water stopped working. Foot pad to tilt and untilt unit disengaged inside of unit. I will never buy a bissell again.
2,Did OK then Broke,"I originally purchased this machine to keep my new home carpet looking new. We do not have any pets nor do we wear our shoes in the house, but I do live in an area where there is a lot of dust.The Bissell Pro-Tech did an ok job except it left the floor wet and the unit leaked on my tile floor while I was picking up all the cruddy material that it left on my carpet. It has been about a year and my carpets still looks new but the machine has given out-one of the small plastic attachments inside that switches from floor to tools broke off leaving the machine useless. I am now looking to replace it with one of the Hoover cleaner-lots of neighbors have them and their carpets look almost as good as mine except they wear their shoes in the house."
1,Good Idea ruined by cheap Plastic parts,"The first time I used the machine it was GREAT. Then the splastic sprocket that rolls the roller brush broke. Under warranty, no problem. Drove 60 miles to have it fixed, picked it up the following week. Once again, it worked great for the next three uses. Then the same plastic part broke again. No longer under warranty. I think the people who are giving this machine good reviews haven't owned it long enough for the plastic to wear out. Bissell could have a great machine if they wouldn't use such cheap parts. They might find people are willing to pay the higher price for a dependable machine."
5,This carpet cleaner works miracles,"I normally don't enter reviews for products I have purchased, but after using this machine I had to respond. My carpets have been professionally cleaned for years, but this has become quite expensive. I decided to try the cleaning myself, and after careful investigation I decided the Bissell machine was the one I would try. And wow did it work! My husband couldn't believe how clean the carpets have become. And with the convenience of having this in my own home, I can clean any time I want. I would recommend this product to anyone!"
4,"Well, I do like this cleaner.","I have have this cleaner and it has worked great for me! It cleaned my VERY DIRTY CARPETS (2 toddlers, pets and a husband! :-) ) to almost a profesional clean! I found it easy to operate and the attachments easy to use as well. Reguardless of what the other people have said, It is really easy to fill the water and cleaning fluid. Perhaps they should make sure they are operating it right?The one complaint I have is that if you take off the attachments really fast, and IMMIDIATELY after use, it does drip a little water.I would recommend for future owners, read the ENTIRE MANUAL prior to plugging it in! Make sure you are using it right!!I love this and will recommed!"
1,Steamer won't spray,"I used the unit one time and yes, it did a beautiful job. But a year later it wouldn't spray. I contacted the support and we did everything to fix it. Finally we had to take it to a professional repair shop and $60 later it worked beautifully again. Several months later when I went to use it again, same thing.I've gotten 2 good uses out of it."
2,Good on Cleaning - Short on Durability,"I'll keep this short and sweet:While the unit did a good job cleaning, after three years of fickle operation it's on its way to the carpet cleaner graveyard. It started with leaks from the detergent take, progressed into a cracked plastic housing such that the handle wouldn't stand on its own, and ended with multiple plastic bits on the carpet suction end breaking so as to make it basically unusable. I'm disappointed it only lasted 3 years with maybe 5-6 major usages per year. I also had bad (durability) experience w/Bissell steam mop, so looks like I'm changing brands. . ."
2,"After replacing my Hoover for this today, I am returning this Bissel tomorrow.","Unfortunately, my Hoover died after 13 months and I replaced it with this today. The sample cleaner in the box had spilled out and that was my first negative when preparing to use this. It appears to clean the carpet well but for some reason about 4 minutes into the cleaning it makes this vibrating noise. If I press the nozzle to release the soap solution it will stop for awhile but will come back again. This may just happen to be a lemon and others may not do this.The tank in tank is not a good design. It is very difficult to clean even with the kitchen sink sprayer. I feel like it has to be filled with water more than other cleaners. You also have to empty the waste water more. The parts are all plastic and appear will be broken in the future.I gave this 2 stars because it does clean well but may not last long. Also, the scotch guard feature is a positive."
2,flimsy plastic parts make this a poor investment,"I've had this machine for about two years now. Although it does an exellent job at cleaning carpets and stairs, parts began to break recently. The service center where I took it told me that this Bissell machine (and Bissell machines in general) are poorly designed and do not hold up well over time. My machine is no exception. His recommendation? Spend the extra 80 dollars and get the Royal carpet machine. Similar design--critical parts are metal and overall are easier to fix."
2,It worked for awhile,"I am typing this review after just having burried my Bissell. Had I written it closer to the time of purchase, the rating would have been higher. Alas, I have fallen into the category of ""it worked for awhile."" For two years I was satisfied with this carpet cleaner. Admittedly, I never loved it. It is very heavy. While you are cleaning a single room that is fine, but if you have to move it up stairs or pick it up to move it around, it is burdensome. Anyway, after two years of ""it's better than a rental and I don't have to call somebody"" it stopped working. It no longer sprays. I tried all of the troubleshooting suggestions before taking the thing apart and it's doomed. I really hoped I would have gotten more than two years of service from it and my back is killing me."
1,NOT WORTH IT!!!,"This is probably the most worthless purchase I've made in my life. I was unimpressed with it from the start. The Rug Doctor machines that you can rent at the grocery store are far better. This machine can only get light dirt off the carpet. To get a real stain out you have to use the attachment and scrub. And forget about using the spinning attachment, it all show. You would have better results with a squirt gun and a pin wheel. I've had numerous problems with it from band breaking to the water bladder collapsing. Currently my machine isn't working. It stopped spraying. If I sound bitter it's because this is the second Bissell I've owned that broke after only three months of light use. DON'T MAKE MY MISTAKE."
5,Carpet cleaner,This product is very easy to use and does a great job cleaning the carpet. It also cleans hard floors and furniture. I really enjoy using it.
1,Poor quality unit,I used this unit twice and now it does not dispense any shampoo nor watee. when it worked it did clean the carpet but only worked twice. It is too expensive capret cleaning if you have to repair or replace the unit after using two times. The design is poor and so is the quality of this cleaner. I will not buy any carpet cleaner from this company. My rating for both quality and design is zero no stars.
1,Bissell needs to go back to the drawing board,"I Bought my first one a couple of years ago, had it in shop right away,at last complained to bissell, they sent me a new one(believe it was refurbished) Well it started leaking, not spraying, then all of a sudden it smelled burned rubber, Yep the teeth on the roller were gone and the belts were breaking, since it is attatched to a pump, The fix it man said that is $40.00 labor $80. I will pick it up and probably use it only for cleaning my car or furniture since the rug attatchment is dead, I am looking at a Hoover Duo. consumers say it is the best..it is more expensive but when You have dogs..you need it..The Rug Doctor is still the best on market but out of my price range. Good Luck to All"
1,Bad Purchase,"I used this 3 times before the brush roller broke. I attempted to get factory service however bissel would not warranty the brush roller, even though I owned it for only a couple months. I have had this product for about 18 months now and it has broken again.I would not buy another Bissel."
1,Wouldn't recommend it,The construction is terrible. It broke 3 times within the warranty and is now broken again. I will not purchase another Bissell product.
5,Awesome!,"This is the best I've ever had.. I've had mine over 5 years and us it every month if not more. I have two small kids and two cats and a messy husband. Well worth it! The house we now live in has Burber carpet and there were unknown stains all over the carpet when we bought the house. Surprisingly, this carpet cleaner got them all out. My Bissell keeps going and going! I'm dreading the day it dies. I've still never had it SERVICED or needed to replace a belt. The only thing I've replaced was the water container due to the movers smashing it.I will say for those who might have problems with the sprayer, always remove the water container and solution container and keep them seperate from the machine or let them dry before putting them back in the machine.I highly recommed Bissell to everyone and I've already turned 4 of my friends on to it."
1,dont buy the 3 disk edition,"this is horribly compressed, as i expected, but also there is a horrible distortion at the bottom of the image almost every time theres a fast cut from one scene to the next. its a bunch of white lines that ive never seen at the bottom of anything commercially produced. oh well netflix has the larger box set for rent...guess ill just have to copy those to make up for my horrid regrettable purchase.also this defect shows up on my PC and DVD player...so im pretty sure its not my hardware generating it."
5,"Yes, bad ending...","Great series.I played the Sega Dreamcast spin off and was fasinated by the story elements I read from a link on the main menu. Then I checked out the series was very impressed.For those of you who dislike the ending, know that the story was supposed to continue as an animated series but was never made. The manga is almost word-for-word identical to the animated series and goes well past the ending from this boxed set. If you didn't like how it ended, check out the manga."
5,I love this radio!,This is a great little shortwave radio. I enjoy being able to hear broadcasts from the whole world. I even took it on a trip to Mexico and it picked up stations there. Amazing radio. I highly reccomend it. I doubt you'll do better for the price.
5,"Very nice, silky, smells great","perfect for a moment of personal pampering and relaxation. very silky, works wonderfully. Is lovely on my very dry hands"
1,Great Tracks/Lousey Quality,"I was really excited about this 80's music DVD. It has some great tracks on it (how often do you find Scritti Pollitti videos?!?!), but the video quality is pretty bad. It looks like a 10th generation dupe of a VHS tape, pretty disappointing. :("
3,Worth it!,"Andras Schiff here shows us the lively and interesting side of Haydn's piano sonatas which are generally somewhat boring when played by others. Haydn's music greatly resembles Mozart's (sonatas) and Schiff manages to bring out that Mozart-like quality in this record. However Haydn's sonatas, while they each are quite different can sometimes be quite monotonous when Schiff tries to make them bigger than what they are. They are simple music really designed for students and relaxing music. When interpreted with a ""Beethoven-like"" quality they really can be destroyed."
5,Tanning Mounting Mammals Birds Reptiles Fish,"A complete, illustrated guide to skinning, tanning, mounting, and displaying large and small mammals, birds, reptiles, and fishMcFall takes you through every step of the taxidermic process, beginning in the field with proper methods of collecting and caring for specimens. Following chapters cover skinning and mounting birds; skinning and mounting small mammals; skinning game heads and large mammals; tanning animal skins; modeling and mold making; making manikins and ear liners; mounting game heads, antlers and feet; mounting large animals, making fur rugs; and making artificial teeth, tongues and eyes.The difficult task of stuffing and mounting fish becomes, by the McFall's method, both easy and rewarding. Other chapters include Reptiles and Amphibians, Preparing specimens for scientific study and on making natural habitat groups. More than 150 drawings and photographs illustrate this clear, step-by-step handbook."
3,Somewhat Useful,"I bought this book to help me write comedic material. In this regard it was somewhat helpful. Ray lists the four different kinds of comedy, which include comedy of superiority and comedy of recognition. Another useful point he makes is that humor must always have a target. If you don't mind the crude writing (Ray continually refers to his ""Pyramid of Comedy,"" a description of which is nowhere to be found) and the sloppy spelling, this book may be of service."
4,4 down 5 to go,Everyone has settled nicely into the sitcom by now. Even though a lot of the gags are continually repeated it still makes you laugh. That is the ongoing strength of ELR. Disfunctional families in the USA are not that much different to those in Australia
4,Would have been 5 Stars if......,"This set was hilarious. especially the ""sex talk"" episode. I had watched this a few nights prior to buying this set and laughed so hard I was crying, and was so pleasantly surprised to see it on this season...it is not a waste of money, but I do believe moviemakers should rethink the widescreen thing for an at home movie/tv show set. I see that season 5 is in widescreen too.... Boo hoo."
4,Another great season for ELR,This was right up with the standard set in the first three seasons - very enjoyable to the last episode
4,Raymond,"If you like the TV show, it is just wonderful. A lot of great highlights. Fun to have on hand."
5,ONE OF THE BEST SEASONS OF ONE OF THE BEST TV SHOWS EVER,"This is probably the best season of ELR along with #6 or, as I once heard Ray Romano call it, the Sargeant Pepper season. There are more classics per disc in season 4 than per season on later years such as ""Bad Moon Rising"", ""The Tenth Anniversary"" (Raymond's face when he realizes he erased the wedding video is a clasic!), ""The Christmas Picture"" (hilarious), ""Robert's Divorce"" (underrated and one of my favorite episodes) as well as the one where Robert gets gored by a bull in the ""upper tigh"". Just to name a few !"
5,Hilarious!!!,"This show is just plain hilarious, I cannot stop laughing. I just finished season #3. I cannot wait til season #4 is released. Keep em coming folks, your doing a great job with the releases."
3,Classis Xanth,"I just finished reading Question Quest, and as a Xanth fan myself, it has everything a fan would expect. However, much of what endears Xanth to the reader has been overdone and overused. It is interesting, however, to see the land from the point of view of Xanth's grumpiest Magician, and much of the history of Xanth is explained, including the origins of a bit character or two. Unfortunately, the thought process of the main character is painfully similar to the thought processes of every other main character in the other Xanth novels. Expect the same emotions, fears, and thoughts as you've seen from Dor, Bink, or any of the others. Not bad, but not unique, another addition to the 'trilogies' of Xanth."

3,Decent,"I thought that this book was decent, but it was also extremely tedious. It was nice to hear Humphrey's side of the story, but the book went on for way too long. I really wouldn't reccommend it too strongly."
3,"Cute necklace, but was sent gold instead of silver","Nice necklace, but I was sent gold instead of silver. Also, shipping costs are way too high for such a small inexpensive item."

4,This is a good tool,I bought this chuck to use on my leg it's a little larger than I thought it would be but it works very well and well made
1,Apparently I need Blackberry for Idiots...,"If this is for dummies, then I need the one for idiots! Seriously! This is not a book for beginners. (I'm still looking for that one, I'll keep you posted) It reminds me of the software books written by people who are so knowledgeable about the subject that they've lost their ability to ""break it down"" for the common folk. Hard to find some of the most basic information. Very, very frustrating and disappointing. If you're new to the berry - don't start here."
1,this is not for dummies,"Yikes...when I say I am a dummy, I mean I am a DUMMY! This book presumes that you have a lot of knowledge about Blackberry. On page 25, they are already telling you what the shortcuts are. How about telling me first how to text, look at my voicemail etc.?!? My old phone was so easy. please pretend I am a NEOPHYTE."
4,Worth the read,"This book is worth the read, for those interested in knowing a bitmore about these intelligent PDA's ... not only a specific model (Curve orother) but also about other ones.The info is well laid out, and is comprehensive in all aspects ....yet not such details to be boring. It's a middle-of-the-road guide,so don't expect any ""hacks"" to be listed time after time in this work."
5,Excellent,"Product received in excellent condition, as described. However, I failed to specify the Blackberry for Dummies I needed required a volume describing the touch screen edition. This was the only exception omitted in this volume. I have r3eturned it for credit. Thank you,Phil Crenshaw"
3,Not as good as Bartimaeus,"Overall the story was interesting, but it felt a bit rushed and was strictly a children's story. I had previously read the Bartimaeus Trilogy, and loved them, so my expectations were high. I found the end very disappointing. There was no mystery, everything seemed so final and back to normal."
3,ok,"This was one of a stack of books I read a few months ago, and it was a bit odd after reading all three Bartimaeus books.It just wasn't a terribly interesting story. The characters took major calamity in the family with little more than a blink, and the fact that the little brother of the family began exhibiting ""evil"" tendencies warranted suspicion of drug use."
4,Good Book!,"Author: Jonathan StroudPublisher: Random House Books for ChildrenPlace of Publication: New YorkCopyright Date: 1999An evil is unleashed when a cross is dug up while Michael is asleep on a lush green hill in the book Buried Fire. When he wakes up he realizes that the world looks red and black. Later, he learns he has had the four gifts of the dragon bestowed upon him, but he's not the only one! The other ones offer him great power.Now he has a choice: help his family or bring the evil dragon up on a field in England. The conflict in this book is good vs. evil and you know, like in many other books, good triumphs over evil. I give this book stars because of the, suspense and adventure. Read to find out if Michael will save the world or if he will destroy the human civilization! It all happens in Buried Fire where Michael McIntyre goes from a shy little boy to a man with mystical powers so read quickly!"
3,Decent read,"This book turned out to be about average. I found myself quite interested in the subject matter, and interested to learn about the mystery behind the ""special powers"" given to the main character. However, I felt like much of the story was never fully developed.I like all of Stroud's original concepts and ideas, but the book falls short because there just isn't enough depth to it. It's 330 pages, and the text seems large. I am not a fast reader, yet I got through the book in a few days.Overall, it was good enough to hold my interest and not make me feel like I had wasted the time or money. It's a decent read, but it doesn't come close to the Bartimaeus Trilogy. If you've just read that and your foaming at the mouth for more, unfortunately this isn't quite it, but it will at least keep you entertained for a little while."
1,"Not Exactly, Stroud...","Before this book, I read the Bartimaeus trilogy, which was an AMAZING group of books. I was excited, and found this- another book by my currently favorite author! How bad could it be?!Answer: AWFUL.I'm a person who loves almost all books. But this one has hardly a redeeming quality... the plot is frivolous and unorgiginal, the writing doesn't have Stroud's normal spark of humor and excitement, and the characters are flat and stereotypical. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS BOOK. Unless it's a gift for your least favorite uncle. If it is, make him suffer through it by all means. But don't wish this awful book on yourself or a loved one."
2,"Early Stroud book, writing is less refined","I enjoyed Jonathan Stroud's ""Bartameus Trilogy"" and bought this book because it was from the same author. This is one of Stroud's earliest books and I found his style to be much less refined and articulate. ""Buried Fire"" was not a gripping and exciting a story, and not one of my better reads."
3,Nothing but talk,"Don't expect this DVD to have any cool fight scenes. It pretty much has to do only with Yusuke talking to the first Spirit Detective, Kuroko. The First 2 episodes were basically Yusuke's time spent with Kuroko. Kuwabara and Kayko popped up a few times but only a few. Basically, some minions of one of the Kings wanted to make Yusuke the new leader so they want him to go to the Demon Realm to train. The last episode was the best out of all of them since Yusuke FINALLY confessed his love for Kayko. Also, Hiei and Kurama finally appear with strange messages from 2 of the other kings of Makai too."
3,A yuyu that wasn't to good!(by Kasem M. Abdullah),"the 1st episode & last episode sucked. the 2nd was O.K. Ireally think this yuyu DVD wasn't to good.13+ for bad language,achohol use, & mild violenceP.S. check my & my little brother(Joey) reviews"
4,Three?,I actually didn't realize that this was three controls! Oh well.I do really like the feel and responsiveness of the control. Works well.
4,Works with MythTV/Mythbuntu,"I use this remote control throughout my house with my current Mythbuntu setup. Well, I did add a Linux sticker to it. :)The only way it would be better is if MythTV had setup all of the buttons correctly. But, I'm pretty sure that the software will allow the programming of buttons. And the buttons that do work are all of the commands that I need."
1,TERRIBLE QLTY,DRAWS DO NOT CLOSE TERRIBLE QUALITY DO NOT BUY. I AM USING THIS IN MY OFFICE BUT DRAWS DON'T CLOSE I DO NOT RECOMMEND ANYONE TO BUY THIS.
1,President,Pretty flimsy metal; easy to assemble; well packaged;fits nicely under desk;in the initial information dimensions were not givenbut it worked out well since I wanted one to go under my desk.
3,Screws do not fit the holes in order to make this a mobile file cabinet,"Casters very difficult to install. The screws do not fit ! The front caster could not be installed at all, since the screws sent did not fit the holes! Could have been made so that the mobile file cabinet is actually able to be mobile!"
2,Not so great...,"This metal file cabinet looks great, but the bottom drawer does not work properly. You have to re-aligned every time you open it in order to close. Not a good construction. If I was aware of this, I wouldn't have bought it."
1,"Not worth the $, Cheap, Flimsy","I purchased this because I only needed one large drawer for filing in my home office and thought this would be perfect. Plus the two top drawers would help with my office organization. The cabinet was put together easily, the wheels just needed to be attached but I couldn't get the screws to go in all the way so the wheels aren't sturdy and I ended up just removing them.After I had my files put in the drawer, the drawers wouldn't close all the way. I removed the files, the drawers shut fine. Files back in, they wouldn't close. I found that if I lifted the drawer and then pushed down while I was closing it, it shut! Although this shouldn't be that difficult! Now the drawers open at random times... lovely.Also the lock feature is great, except it doesn't lock properly (or unlock properly). Not sure how it unlocked the top and bottom drawer but not the middle drawer.In conclusion, pass on this cabinet. It's NOT worth the $100+ that they charge."
5,Linklater knows that small towns can suck.,"I rented this movie for two reasons: the first being that I was stood up by a friend on a Saturday night and wanted something to calm my anger; and secondly, it looked good. I must say, from start to finish, this is a wonderfully directed movie. The performances that Richard Linklater got out of these actors was astounding. Out of all of them, I think that Goivanni Ribisi gave one of his all-time best (even compared to Saving Private Ryan, which I think was his finest dramatic moment).Everything about the movie screams teen-angst, from the theft of a lawn-knome, to one of the many anti-MTV sentiments.I gave this movie 5 stars because I was tired and ornery when I put it in, and by the end I couldn't fall asleep if I had wanted to."
3,Teen Angst,"I saw this movie in a sunday at 2 A.M. and I think it`s a nice hour to watch it. ""Suburbia"" is one of those movies that captures well the state of loneliness and melancholy that the late-teens/ young adults feel when they enter a world with limited perspectives and an uncertain future. Yep, it`s the everyday world we all live in. The director Richard Linklater innovates a bit (again) as he prefers to center all the plot action in a single night, developing some key moments for his characters. The teens portrayed here seem a bit stereotyped in the beginning but they slowly change during the movie. The dialogue and camera-work are realistic and the acting usually competent. However, it`s a bit slow at parts and the overall atmosphere is not for everyone. But for those who try it, it`s still a good indie-movie with something to say about today`s youth."
5,Vun-der-full!,"I love this movie. Giovanni Ribisi is a wonderful actor, and he is obviously on the way to big things. If you've seen him in any of his 'big' movies, check this one out- he's at his best."
1,Let me tell you about the worst movie ever.,"For the love of GOD!!! the others who reviewed this movie must have something majorly wrong with their brains. This was the worst movie I HAVE EVER SEEN!!!!! and I have seen alot. Please, everyone who reads this: buy this movie and publicly burn it. Do it for humanity!!"
1,"Waste of time and money, even to rent it","This is for pre-pubescent teens. Very dull story line. No point. Worlds apart from the brilliant punk classic 'Suburbia' released in 1983, directed by Penelope Spheeris."
5,Great movie,"I really enjoyed Suburbia when I watched it for my first time a few years ago, in the middle of a night. It has a nice style and mood, and the soundtrack is exellent. The director Linklater has done a great work here, I think."
2,This book is not for WinForm developers,"The Patterns that the GoF are all applicable to WinForms, but this book assumes all web developing in its examples. I bought the book because I am a .NET WinForms developer so I if you are a web developer this book may help you, but it didn't do it for me.I found the original GoF book, ""Head First Design Patterns"", even ""Design Patterns for Dummies"" better than this book. Also, it is unfortunate that .NET developers have to resort to these books and do not have a definitive Patterns book in any .NET language. The ""Design Patterns in C#"" is OK but that book has questions placed in there on nearly every page asking you to do something that isn't covered yet in the book which is bothersome..NET developers would do well to stay away from this book even if you are a patterns lover."
3,Just not what you expect,"There's some good stuff in this book, but it isn't a dedicated patterns book, if you ask me. On top of that there's just too much crap in the form of extremely poor editing resulting in typos on every second page and the code listings are very poor; well the content is half decent but agian the formatting clutters the big picture."
3,Good content. Non-existent editing.,"THE GOOD: The patterns in this book are very good. Useful, informative, and well explained. The author really seems to know his stuff and convey it well.THE NO SO GOOD: Too much time is spent inadequately introducing concepts that the reader should just be sent to another book for. Ironically the author realizes this and says so before he goes forward with his useless introductory material.THE BAD: It appears that I am the first person to read this book since it was completed. It is probably among the five most poorly edited software books I have ever seen. Simply read the fist 10 pages and you will find at least one non-sensical sentence per page. Sometimes this is as simple as an extra verb or the accidental use of ""it"" when the author meant ""is"". Other times the entire thought becomes indecipherable in the middle of a line."
2,How-To book not a 'Patterns' book,This more of a how-to book than a patterns book. The author tries hard to make this a patterns book but its not. Its not a bad book.. just not what I expected from it.
1,Motor burned out and caught fire on first use.,"After reading all the reviews posted here I was excited to give this machine a try. I had only used about two thirds of a gallon of clean water solution when the motor started to smoke. Before I could hit the off switch with my foot sparks flew out, then a small flame, and finally puffs of black smoke out each side of the machine.Needless to say it's going back in the box and being returned.To Hoover's credit the water in the dirty water bucket was quite dirty so it was getting dirt up before it blew up.I also tried calling customer service and had a hard time getting through. They were not very helpful and suggested I take this brand new machine into an authorized service agent. No thanks."
2,This steamvac stinks,"I am very frustrated with this steamvac and am about to throw it out the window. We did a lot of research before we purchased it and so many people said it was great. We've had it for three years. The first few times we used it we had success but then the passageway starts getting all clogged with hair/debris and CANNOT be cleaned without extreme effort of taking the screws out, etc., etc. Now it has so little suction that it is virtually useless. It is also NOT a steam vac - We have to heat our water up and put it in and even then, it does not remain hot enough by the time it exits the vac to the floor - the water is cool. I want to warn potential buyers.- Kris Day"
2,Lots of stains on my carpeting,"This carpet cleaner has worked well the first couple times but since then does next to nothing except get the floor wet. Even when attempting to clean a fresh stain, I can't get the stain out with this. I have had better luck with my little handheld dirt devil. Its not easy to clean this thing out either so its probably just clogged. Additionally, I have to heat the water up before putting in there because it comes out cold. Even with hot water added, its still NOT steam as the name would imply. Unfortunately this is the only one I have ever owned (aside from the handheld) so can't recommend a better one. This one does seem to do well with just picking up a bit of dirt and probably a few allergens that are lying in the carpet."
5,Tough and Durable,Rubbermaid uises the best plastic in the business in their brute line. They take a beating even in cold weather without cracking and last much longer than their competitors. A little more cost but well worth it.
3,Brute Container,The picture was misleading. The container did not come with a lid. I had to order a lid separately.The container is well made.
4,happy,these are just as described. good quality. They were delivered in a timely manner also.I would recommend to anyone that is looking for a good strong bucket w/o lid.
2,Arrived quickly and in good packaging.,But I didn't realize it was a record. The original ad was not clear. I don't own a record player and the person I bought it for as a gift doesn't either. I thought it was a cd. But the product was sent in a well-protected package. It was sent in good time. I got it pretty quickly. I am sure the music is good because my relative loves Ann Murray but we couldn't listen to it. I just wish it was clearer that it was a record because it doesn't do me much good if it is not a cd. oh well.
2,Anne's foray into late 80's pop...,"This was Anne Murray's venture into the pop music arena in 1987/88. Earlier in the decade, she scored a top 10 hit with ""Now and Forever (You and Me)"". While the song marked a clear departure from her mellow, country-infused sound, it made Anne look like she was doing a parody of herself. Anyone remember the video for this song?There she is, in an elevator with a guy (supposedly a love interest) who is clearly half her age. As if that wasn't strange enough, Anne's wearing a fur coat with a leather mini skirt underneath, pumps and spiked hair! Who was she trying to be? Tina Turner?The style and image makeover clearly didn't work and surely didn't last. After this album, Anne went to recording AC music with her next album, ""As I Am"". The songs on the Harmony album aren't bad - just a little inconsistent with what you'd expect from Anne Murray."
1,Defective after Defective,I'm sure that anyone that gets the parts not defective will like the product. The trays are nailed together with super small nails. The pieces of a shelf fell apart in the packaging so I had to order a replacement shelf. The replacement part came after three weeks and I started to take the rest of the parts out of the box. Everything looked good. I assembled the unit per the instructions. Then I got the knife holder part of the instructions and I could not find the holes they told me to screw it into. I couldn't find the holes because the factory assembled the top of the table backwards! The knife holes are on the outside of the table (away from the handle). From the picture you can clearly see that is going to be a problem. At this point I will most likely have this thing for a month partially assembled. Truly disappointed.
2,broken?,Splintered wood on top shelf and wood is detaching from the middle shelf. Sending it back is going to be such a hassle to repackage and I was so excited to set it up too. help?
4,Very nice cart!,Easy to assemble. The wood is smooth with a nice grain to it. I really like the knife block on the end. An excellent buy.
4,Functional,I live in a smalll apartment with no kitchen room at all. So this product fits perfectly for my needs.
5,Sturdy Cart Gets Me Organized,"It is a sturdy cart, and it is an attractive cart. I have been able to get more organized in my kitchen because I bought this item. The wheels are not as smooth as I would like, but they work as long as I am careful."
5,Better construction than expected,"After moving into a smaller apartment, I found myself in need of a small microwave stand. I searched around at several retail stores, but couldn't find anything that didn't seem super cheap and unstable around this price point. Long story short, this particular cart is much, much better quality than the other carts I've looked at in this price range. It looks great, seems very stable, and was easy to assemble by myself. Can't ask for much more for $100. The bottom slats did have some minor separation (only held together with three small nails on each side), but nothing some wood glue couldn't fix. Overall I was pleasantly surprised by the quality."
5,Highly Recommend,Effortless assembly !Very sturdy and arrived as advertised.Was exactly what I have been looking for at half the price of what I found locally.I'm already planning on ordering another one to further expand my kitchen space and storage.
3,Ok bang for the buck,"The cart was reasonably priced at $99. Easy to assemble and pretty sturdy. One problem is that they screwed in the rails to the underside of the tabletop at the factory and didnt screw them in straight. SO, the cutting board doesn't slide in and out easily on the rails. A minor problem. But I'd say have some additional short wood screws set aside just in case. Still, everything was pretty solid on this produt. A message to Winsome: Improve your QA over there in Thailand!! 3.5 out of 5 stars."
4,Great kitchen addition,"The cart is a very useful addition to my kitchen and just what I was looking for. I use it for additional counter space for a toaster oven and for other storage. Assembly was definitely a two-person job. The screw heads were not standard for use with a Philips or regular screwdriver. A ""very small"" tool was provided but made assembly difficult. Overall I love it and it was a good value."
3,"Attractive, but kinda fragile and not so functional","Well, I am keeping it because it looks nice and was easy to put together, but there are a few problems with it. first, the wood is kind of fragile. I will not be able to put anything heavy on the shelves, certainly not my microwave, for fear they will break. Also, there is no way the paper towel holder will fulfill its intended function. It does not come apart. How am I supposed to get a paper towel roll onto it? I think it is going to have to be a regular towel holder instead, but it's a stunningly awful design flaw."
4,Good bargain,Bought this cart to use for a microwave stand. Went together in about a half hour and is very stable. Only complaint is I wish it would have a bigger knife rack. As it is designed it can only hold three large knives. Other than that it works great for it's purpose.
1,Poorly pre-assembled,"I ordered this cart after doing some customer review searches. It looked good and had decent reviews. I was disappointed when I opened the box (which was in good shape, no tears or bent in corners) to find the middle rack 'broken'. It was packed with the cutting board on top, then cardboard, followed by the middle rack and then more cardboard, and the other shelf. It was packed well but the rack was poorly assembled. Winsome had used wood glue and tiny, almost worthless nails to hold the wooden slats to the end support boards, which had come unglued/separated. I question whether the shelf would be able to support anything heavy, such as pots and pans, if this is the way it was constructed. I would not recommend this product if you are going to be using it to hold plates/pots/anything heavy as it may just snap. I'll be returning this, assuming they are going to pay for shipping and refund my money."
2,A survey of milling - not a how-to book,"I was expecting a hands-on tutorial on the use of a vertical milling machine. Instead all I got was a nice novel complete with detailed photographs of the author's accomplishments. He is accomplished, he just doesn't tell us how he did any of it!"
4,"Very Nice, though a bit fragile",I purchased this in the brown; had to re-order twice because the first two didn't survive shipping.But it is a very pretty serving plate - I love the large size and the color. I subsequently purchased several other complementary pieces in this same style and color!
5,Excellent!,"There is nothing else to say. If you want to know the ""real"", please read this book and others that are similar."
4,Excellent!,Just a collection of informative vignettes detailing the Brothers and Sisters contributions to the creation of the Old West. Yet another piece of the historical African puzzle that everyone (but especially Blacks) need to become aware of.
4,POLITICAL WRITER SCORES WELL WITH EXCELLENT BUSH BIOGRAPHY,"Elizabeth Mitchell, ironically a political writer for George magazine, has done very well in the writing of her first published book, a biography of popular Texas governor George W. Bush, the 2000 presidential election frontrunner. Maintaining an adequately neutral position in the process, Mitchell has penned an entertaining bio that resonates with the boundless energy and competitive fire that have come to be associated with Governor George W. Bush. An informative and worthwhile look at possibly the next to serve us as President of the United States."
1,Stop! Read this...,"We purchased the Bissell carpet cleaner approximately 2 years ago. This was the biggest mistake we have ever done!The leaky tank, the poor or absent suction, the cap that you can't tighten without stipping on the solution tank, the self destructing brushes, oh, and how about the problematic trigger that would sometimes spray the cleaning solution on the carpet or NOT and one more, the vaccuum hose cracks.During the first year we had it, we drove approximately 20 miles to the nearest repair shop THREE times for repairs under warranty. Ended up spending another $[money]in repairs after the brushes self destructed when the machine was just 18 months old.We finally put it out with the garbage last week and we will be purchasing a Hoover SteamVac.Oh, and it may sound like we've used it a lot, but we haven't at all. This machine probably had a life of about 5 hours total cleaning time!"
2,Not so good.,"We bought this machine about a year ago. We liked the features. We were pleased with its first couple of performances, and then it began to fall apart. We aren't hard on appliances, but the hose apparatus never did stay in its holder. The hand tool quit working the fourth time we used it. The bottom front, made of clear plastic, simply broke and fell off today, requiring a duct tape fix to finish the job. It's darn fragile for such a mighty-looking machine. I'm online to buy another shampooer. I'm staying away from this brand."
1,heater failed after very little use,we have used less than four gallons of cleaning solution and always used the bissell products. the machine failed to dispense fluid. we took it to the listed repair shop and they stated the heater and a line were stopped up with some sticky solution and they ask if we had used some other products which we had not and had always followed the instructioins. it woud cost $100. to repair we told them to dumpster it. we would never purchase any bissell products again.
1,Stop! don't buy this product,"Bought it, used it once, next time I pulled it out of the closet it didn't work, no spray from the bottom. Went to the authorized repair man, he told me I bought the worst machine Bissell ever made. He wanted to charge me $85.00 to repair the heater. I figured I would cut my loses and not get it repaired. Glad i read the other reviews it seems like others had the same problem.Regarding the attachments. be careful if you have the attachments stored on the back incorrectly the sprayer button gets pushed and it sprays everywhere. Yes the sprayer on the attachments work. Stay away from this machine"
5,Give the designer a HUG!,"We've had this wonderful appliance for just over a year, and I have to say I love it more each time I use it, which is why I felt compelled to write a review. If you're contemplating the purchase of a carpet cleaner - this is the one. I know it's the only one with a built-in water heater, which is a big plus, but for me the ease of use via the simple brilliance of the design is what makes it unbeatable. I particularly loathe cleaning appliances that require excess ""fiddling"" to operate, refill, etc, and have endured some doozies of carpet cleaners in the past (you know, the ""use them once and put them away in the closet forever"" type). The Bissell Proheat is fast, wonderfully easy to use, and very effective. You couldn't want anything more from a carpet cleaner."
2,Great Features. Cheap Manufacturing.,"I bought this machine because I have always owned Bissell products. I started to clean my carpets with it and it stopped dispensing the cleaner after about 30 minutes of use. I called Bissell who sent me a new dispenser, and that one never worked at all. I took the machine back to retailer and will not buy another Bissell again. Bissell wanted to keep sending me parts rather than have me take back my machine, lousy service. Also, I had to keep filling the bladder with water, it would use a ton of water on a very small amount of carpet."
2,Below Average,"Pros -- It delivers a lot of water/cleaner- It has a built-in cleaning tool- Has a large storage tankCons -- Terrible suction. Carpet is always left soaking wet- Terrible suction. Water collects in the hose when using the tool further reducing the suction.- Terrible suction. The suction is, simply put, terrible.- storage tank is difficult to clean."
1,Recall Item,"I have hade the same problems as eveyone else, heater plugged up.I finally got to fixing it and will see how it does. Funny how its a discontinued model but they still on the shelf at walmart."
2,Go with the Hoover Steam Vac instead. . .,"I bought this to replace my old Hoover Steam Vac. Big mistake. It is not as sturdy as the Hoover. The latch that keeps the unit in the upright position broke after using only once. The machine leaks water from the tank when first starting it, as well as when you stop it and turn it off. It did have good suction for picking up water, but this machine only had suction when you pulled it towards you (the Hoover's suction works when both pushing and pulling the machine.) The Bissell's heating feature for the water is a nice option, however the ""tank-in-tank"" is awkward to use and I had to empty it more often than I did with the Hoover. Additionally, the hard floor attachment is flimsy and almost worthless--it kept falling off and eventually the rubber squeege came off. Needless to say I returned it and purchased a new Hoover. If you want something that is more ""user friendly"" and well built--go with the Hoover."
2,Cleans great . . . but quits spraying on third use,"This machine worked very nice the first two times I used it. Then, like so many other customers, my unit quit spaying. Sure enough, I took mine apart like those before me, and the heater was plugged up with lime and calcium. Terrible design flaw. Rather than attempting to fix it, I bypassed the heater with a piece of my own tubing. It works great now, minus the ""extra-hot"" water. If you buy this, use ONLY distilled water in the one gallon tank. The manufacturer should have thought of this. One nice thing I will say about the 1699. . . it IS powerful and picks up a lot of deep down dirt."
1,Avoid this product!,"Nothing but trouble...We've used the cleaner a total of probably 10 times and had it to the repair shop 3 times. When you design a product that, by its nature, is only used 3 times a year (maximum) your warranty period should be longer than the one offered. We had the same problems as all of the other negative reviews - Brush wouldn't spin, foot pedal for the handle tilt broke, hand tools wouldn't spray, leaked all over the place. I will never buy another bissell product after my experiences with this one. Consider yourself warned."
1,Unhappy,"I have to take it to have it repaired everytime I use it.It works great, when it works.I was told to run a whole tank of water thru it to make sure the water lines stayed clean for the next use but it didn't help.The very first time I used it the belt broke within 5 minutes. I have had nothing but trouble with it. Very disappointed!"
1,Bad machine,"I wouldn't buy this machine if I were you. I like so many others have had the same problem, after one shampooing, it doesn't spray. I think a recall from Bissell is in order!!!!! If this keeps up, they will go out of business."
3,Loved it...but...,"I purchased this bag as a gift. It's a beautiful, sturdy bag. Within a month, however, the clasp broke, so he is unable to clasp it shut. That was disappointing, in part because otherwise he loves the bag so much!"
5,Awesome,"This case is awesome:Very spaceous2 turning wheel locks (you can choose to use it or not no big deal)ProfessionalPrivate zip compartment for your valuablesI bought this due to being a public notary/loan signing agent and the requirement is that we must keep our commission seal lock at all times unless we are using it.A little bit bigger then a regular messenger bag but I love the room for all my papers and notes.Do not fear of the work ""Doctor's Bag"" it's just the name how it opens very nice.The way that it opens it's like a folding lawn chair it stays open and will not close on you. VERY CONVENIENT DO NOT HESITATE BUY IT BUY IT."
4,Great bag for the job,"""Great bag, big bag, and good quality for the price in a short. Looks professional and has a great feel. The lock mechanism as mentioned in past feedbacks is not the best but can be overlooked as the price and quality of the bag is very nice. I would give it a 4 1/2 if it was possible."""
5,a good bag,"This briefcase is well constructed and designed. So many bags try to be too much, with too many useless little pockets and zippers and not enough function as an actual breifcase. This one has just enough storage and each compartment is roomy enough. The price is a fair, too. You's have to spend 300+ to get something even close to this quality. Buy one and be satisfied"
5,The music on this album is the s@?t!!!!!!!!!!!,"The music on this album is amazing...Wes borland's riffs are very interesting and creative. Except for the parts where Fred does his usual stupid things to ruin the song example (yelling limp bizkit! or yea or the many other annoying things he tends to do) even his parts, on a select few songs, are well written. But this book is a great buy because Wes's riffs are great!"
5,Great vacuum at this price,"I used couple of similarly priced vacuums over the last 5 years and this one is to keep until it lasts. I've been using it for almost 3 years now and had not a single problem.Pros1. Less Sound2. Adjusts automatically very well when you move from hard floors to carpeted areas.3. Detachable Canister is very light and is so convenient to carry around stairs and to clean blinds, etc.4. White color makes it look pleasant and neat and the filter system is a plus.Cons1. Very Very Very very hard to buy replacement bags and filters in stores like Walmart, Target, Kmart,etc.I loaded on bags from amazon just to make sure I will not have problem finding them in future. Same with filters."
4,One Missing Perhaps?,"The Jones girls were a great soulful dance/pop outfit from the early eighties and many of their best tracks are featured here. However what happened to ""You Can't Have My Love"" which is a better song than three quarters of the tracks on this compilation? Oh well, looks like I will have to be content with my old vinyl 12"" copy! ;o)"
4,One of PIR's most overlooked acts gets an anthology.,"Their sucesses were mostly on the urban R&B charts, but The Jones Girls were one of PIR's best acts. These girls cold really sing and their ""At Peace With Woman"" and ""Get As Much Love As You Can"" albums were among the best of their time. This CD has alltheir big hits as well as Shirley's #1 1986 solo hit ""Do You Get Enough Love?""."
1,Doesn't even deal with bankruptcy!,"This tape does not begin to address one topic you see on the video box in the photo. What a total rip-off. It's a poor quality early 90s half an hour how-to video that only shows actors in non-bankruptcy cases. It preaches how you are supposed to tell the truth, make sure you understand the question, give short answers, blah blah - common sense stuff like that. It does not even go into bankruptcy."
2,Not What I Expected,The jump rope is okay. It wasn't what I expected. First the battery will run out fast since the LCD never turns off. I just got this rope so I don't know how long the battery actually lasts but if it never turns off so I suppose it will be dead soon. Second the rope tangles easily. The jelly-ish rope has to be laid out and put books on to make it straight and not tangle. I put books on it and it still tangles on one spot. Third when setting your weight for the counter it starts around 50 and goes up to 360. If you skip your weight you have to press it about 200 times. The numbers only go one way... once it hits 360 then it starts back at 50. I haven't tried to adjust the rope to my size (I've only had it for a day) so I'm not sure if it works easy or not. The plus side is that it counts the number of times you spin the rope and calories you are burning. It's not the best. A regular rope would be better.
5,7-Keto,"I like Bronson vitamins, a friend recommended it to me to check the products they have. This is one of them that I found helpful to my health.,"
1,Very disappointing,"There is virtually nothing here that can't be found in the included help and tutorials of FS2002. The only redeeming feature are the ""adventures"" in the back, but even then, how many times can you fly from Nantucket to Provincetown? And where is the single resource for all of the ILS frequencies that are available in this terrific software?"
2,The book was not what I expected,"I purchased this book expecting it to give me a lot of information on flying all of the aircraft that were available. In particular, I was looking for detailed information on how to master the Boing aircraft so that I could create a proper flight plan that included climb and descent information that I could then execute in a realistic simulation of a commercial flight. However, I found the book contained very little information that was beneficial to me in this area. A significant portion of the book is spent covering topics already covered in the FS2002 documentation. Very little information is given on how to really use the flight planner and navigation log. Overall, I am disappointed with this book and am still looking for one that will really teach me how to master the heavies."
2,Not an extended manual for Flight Simulator 2002,"While this book offers advice on the many items related to flying in general, it is not necessarily very specific for FS2002 (it does use examples of the planes offered in 2002 though). For any experienced flight simmer, it is contains pretty routine information and talks more in generalities than specifics. I was looking more for an ""extended manual"" which would offer specific examples how to use each of the features offered with FS2002. For example, ATC, which is virtually left out of this book entirely. Also, there is no index for looking up a quick reference and no keyboard command reference. For my purposes, I was very disappointed in its content. In my opinion, this is NOT an ""extended manual"" as I've seen it advertised on some web sites, nor is it a ""how to"" book for FS2002 and unfortunately, that is exactly what I was looking for when I bought this book."
1,Encyclopedia of useless trivia,"This book was put together by a researcher who has no feel for FS2002. It is cold, dry and dull! Sure, all the information is here--but it seems to have been written by a technical writer whose boss told him to get something, ANYTHING, in print that will fill 200+ pages ASAP--or else!Don't buy this book. It gives you LOTS of information, but little of it will help you enjoy the game. The writer merely grabbed technical information from flight manuals etc. so that Sybex and MS could try to syphon a bucket-load more money out of your pockets. FS2002 is fantastic..this book isn't!"
1,Can I give this book zero stars?,"Everything the other reviewers say is true. This book is a major letdown. Everything in it amounts to 'filler' material, with nothing of substance. It does look like it was put together in a weekend."
4,The game is for young kids!,"The game is easy, I agree with the review below as far as that goes but thats about all I agree with them on. Its for young kids, it supposed to be easy!! Its a fun game with average graphics that are certainly not poor. My daughter loves the game, shes 8yrs old and I have to ""make"" her get off the computer because once she starts playing it she wont stop. Being a distributor of childrens software my little one has played them all and it takes a great title for her to stay interested. This is one of those titles. Ive never wrote a review on Amazon but after reading the last review I wanted to stick up for a good game and the publisher."
1,worst game EVER,"I HATE THIS GAME. i love the movie and the gamecube vesion but this is low.for one thing the color is is bad when you use a 98another thing, it will go sooo slow you will fall a sleep(really)one more thing! the games are soo stupid and easy. if you buy this game and not like it because its easy and the games are stupid then i have news flash YOU WILL BE THANKING ME I WARNED YOU. im glad they took my moms money back!what did you say???? you said you want examples!!!! OKAY ILL GIVE YOU EXAMPLES! one game you have to put the stupid objets in there shadows! another one???? okay! you have to collect some stupid things then your done! one more but thats it!!!! you have to serve lunch by clicking on what needs to go there! EASY. IF YOU WANT A GAME THEN DONT GET THIS!"
3,Forget the text as a guide; good for beginning level only,"I really looked forward to using this set after having heard some of the other good reviews on here. I was a bit disappointed. First, the book is entirely too poorly organized for easy use. There are two sets of pages, apparently, with scattered ""Practica"" and ""Resumen"" sections,and it's impossible to tell to where the author directs you. Second, the tapes seem pretty short on each side. Perhaps it's because there is a lot of pausing. Third, too many typos. Fourth, Luis, the native speaker on the tapes reminds me of a servant, being told what to say here and there. Granted, there has to be direction... it just seems a bit strained and Luis doesn't seem to enjoy himself at all. Good for beginners and people who want sentence-type knowledge without a lot of substance."
4,Eerily Accurate,"This book is an eye opening portrayal of the way young men in fraternities act and decision make. It doesn't pull any punches. All the familiar archetypes are illustrated, many of whom you would certainly not want your daughters to date. Fortunately, as in the real world, there are characters who provide a sane counter balance. I won't tell you which side comes out on top though.Reading this book will definitely make you remember those times you felt you were swimming against the tide or perhaps those times you went along with the crowd and wish you hadn't."
3,Alexander,"This book was very basic, but easy to follow. It was used in the classroom as an introduction to the life of Alexander the Great. The students were able to follow the story and wanted to learn more based on the brief discriptions of the places introduced in the story. I would recommend this book for a basic introduction to the life of Alexander the Great."
2,"Don't get this if you're interested in computation, and don't get it if you aren't.","This is a rather bland novel interspersed with a very rudimentary introduction to computer science, starting with the basic operation of semiconductors and working up to operating systems, applications, and AI, all at a very superficial and occasionally inaccurate level."
1,"Third Eye Blind, Deaf, and Dumb","What a pleasure it was to watch this single (and the ""band"" responsible for it) die an ignoble death on the charts. From the ambulance-siren ""riff"" to the limp-wristed ""rapping"" near the end, this song is a plague start to finish. Luckily, America didn't buy it."
5,Buy it just to keep the fun going.,I got this for my son's Wii sytem and it works very well. Buy one for your Wii and keep the fun rolling.
2,I just had to have this....,was looking for a particular song and found it on here so I am happy :)Rick
2,A very self righteous look at the F&I War,"The author clearly has done his research and ""digging"" when it comes to the facts. Then how come he is so bitter? Jennings spends too much time not only disputing almost every other book about the French and Indian War, but also ""wrestling to the ground"" any thesis in opposition to his own! He comes off sounding bitter, cranky and unattractive. His glosses over the military aspects of the war as if these details are beneath the serious historian--why? It was a war after all! It is not a bad reference book but as far as read-don't bother."
3,Good reference but not a good read,"Unfortunately the book comes across as extremely cranky. Yes, cranky. The author's tone is self righteous, fussy and cranky, and he looks down his nose at all things military in a distaining way. As if the French and Indian War could be interpreted without the military aspect! For a much better read, try Fred Anderson's ""Crucible of War,"" just published."
2,Not as described and not described clearly,"Just ordered and received this camera and I'm not happy.Despite the ""Technical Details"" bullet point: ""Runs on EIA scanning system and includes 12-volt DC power supply"" it did NOT come with a power supply. Instead it came with a cable one might wire to a power supply- useless without buying additional equipment, which I would have done, had the description been accurate.Further, the camera is BLACK AND WHITE. In retrospect, I can see that the B/W at the end of the the serial number-esque title ""SPECO CVC-57PH/HR B/W"" probably stands for Black and White. But seriously, in the entire 5 paragraph description, this is _not_ mentioned! In the technical details list it is _not_ mentioned. There are many variations of this camera that look very similar to one another. Some I have purchased previously, which were in color. I would expect the Black and White specification to be more clearly and prominently displayed on this model."
4,Nice surprise,"This book turned out to be a lot better, and funnier, than I expected. A giant telepathic alien cabbage worm (dunno what the artist who did the cover with the earthworm on it was thinking) crashes to Earth. It just so happens that it is the future and humans have become comically conservative to the extreme. After a little alien preaching/influence the main chars end up in outer space aboard a cargo/cruise ship and in the clutches of space pirates. Its a brisk fast-paced amusing read and its length of 191 pgs. suits it perfectly."
3,So-so vacuum,"I bought this vacuum based on Consumer Report's study and the reviews on Amazon. The filtration system seems to be quite good but I am very disappointed at how hard it is to push around. The rear wheels just do not move easily, even after lubricating with graphite. It is noisier than my (upper end) Eureka and not any lighter in weight."
1,...,"This vacuum is heavy and very noisy. On board tools are awkward to use, and incomplete. Replacement bags are outrageously expensive. Would not recommend this machine at any price."
5,You need a skimmer!,"I cannot claim experience with a wide array of skimmers (spiders), so I can't really say how this one compares to the competition. It is attractive, comfortable, and seems durable. But just having this tool has made life in the kitchen much happier. I used to use a slotted spoon to fish ravioli and similar objects our of water or oil, and this skimmer is so much more pleasant. Its larger size makes the process go much faster, and the food drains very well.I've been buying a lot of kitchen stuff lately, and for some reason this inexpensive little tool is one of the most satisfying."
5,Architecture as Anthropology!,"Fascinating tour of homes, with most of the really rewarding images revealing the indigenous styles of homes across the globe, including the iglu, the long house, dung hovels, and dozens of other styles that incorporate the folk wisdom of humans across the centuries. The modernist austerities were the least interesting, even more boring than castles from the Hapsburgs. Some of the contemporary puzzle pieces were striking, and each page repaid the time invested pouring over the details captured. I wish that they would double page load, and show a representative interior of each exterior captured here."
3,"Too small, only one photo per house, not very useful","This is a small book on all kinds of houses all over the world. It has one page per house, with a small text presenting the history and background and one photo. It is not very useful for me as the info is too short and generic, the photos do not explain very much. Sometimes it is about some eccentric house sometimes it is about some typical kind of housing. I expected more explanatory info on how they are built or at least some floorplans."
4,nice book,"it was one of my favourites until i got the phaidon atlas of contemporary architecture but this book is also a good one. 500 houses over the world. quick guide to have information around the world.ayse gokbakan yildiz, architect"
5,Not for the Faint-hearted!,"Because I said Forever is not written for the faint-hearted! This book is written for the woman who truly wants God's will in her life more than she wants her own. Reading it will give you a fresh vision of what it looks like when you choose to trust God.Deb's insights have come from applying these truths in her own life. Through perseverance and dependence on God she models what it means to say forever. Her road was not easy. Her journey was long. Her commitment was found in continually seeking God as the answer to her needs and in doing so she was not disappointed.If you are a woman who finds herself trapped in an seemingly hopeless marriage, then this book is a must read. If you are a woman who has begun to take your marriage for granted, you too should read this!This book challenged me to reconsider how I demonstrate my love and respect to my husband of 35+ years.""Because I Said Forever"" should be in every church library."
5,"Wonderful, this book helped save my mariage.","As I read this book I was able to learn how to be true to my beliefs as a christian woman and still assert myself. The things I learned from this book enabled me to be my own best friend and advocate. My husband has changed measurably in his behavior toward me. We both continue to improve. One of he best things I learned about in this book was setting boundries, and enforceing them. I am no longer tossed about by emotional garbage but can step back and see clearly whats happening. Then I can make a rational decision on how to respond to him."
1,Save your money,I expected that these would be fullscreen video similar to what came with the concert DVD of Fallen. This video quality is worse then whats available on most web sites.
3,Speedy Delivery But...,"This item was delivered very quickly, but when I bought it, it was tagged as a ""new"" item, and it was not new when I received it. It was opened and used, although it was in excellent condition."
4,Ride for the Roses - kindle edition,I really enjoyed this book. Ms. Kingston keeps your attention throughout the book. I really enjoy sweet historical romanes. I will be reading more of her books.
3,A Bit of a Disappointment,"I'd read great reviews of this book, so I was really looking forward to it. Unfortunately, it was a real letdown. The ""hero"" spends the entire time denying he cares for the heroine, who, in turn, sleeps with this guy who she knows has no honorable intentions toward her. In fact, the narration constantly stresses how the hero is ""hard hearted Harry"", the guy who will always love 'em and leave 'em. I didn't see these two falling in love. There was just physical attraction, sex, and then the requisite HEA ending, though it made no sense. The rating should be more like 2 1/2 stars - it could have been a lot better."
3,a bit disappointing,"Being a huge fan of Sumi Jo, I was a little disappointed in this album. She's been recorded wrong again, so that her high notes sound screechy. The best recording of Sumi Jo was on her ""Bel Canto"" album. Also, I have a problem with the choice of songs. The best on the album are Ophelie's mad scene and Catherine's aria from ""L'Etoile du Nord;"" other than that one, they're all either pretty standard or else forgettable. And why does ANYBODY ever chop the second verse off of Ophelie's mad scene?! It's not as if they needed to conserve space--the album is pretty short actually."
5,Awesome watch,My husband got this watch for Father's Day and loves it! The dial always glows becasue it dosen't rely on a flouresence glow powered by light which fades after a few hours leaving your watch face dark. This one actually never fades so you can read it all the time.
5,Exactly what I was looking for,"I have owned a number of ""sports"" watches in the past, to include several versions of the G-Shock and Oakley brands. All have had their problems, most notably that they require substantial studying of the manual to learn all the functions. If what you want is a high quality no-frills sports timepiece that can take a beating, the Luminox is it. The tritium markers at the hours glow brightly at night without having to search for a button. And a great look to it as well."
1,DO NOT BUY A LUMINOX.,"I have had this watch for a year and a half. It has never worked for more than a few months in a row. It literally has fallen to pieces. I have never brought the watch under a substantial amount of water (only a swimming pool), nor subjected it to any other kind of significant stress. I would advise against purchasing any Luminox watch."
1,More than a bit of a letdown,"Whoever is responsible for publishing this book has no idea whatsoever regarding genealogy/family history, and in particular in an Irish setting. The amount of incorrect spelling and unreferenced information is a disgrace. This type of publication should be banned."
2,Poor Woody,"It was 1971, the pit of the Dreadful Decade (1965-75), and Woody Herman was afraid of being thought ""out of it."" So he enlisted Rock guitarist Michael Bloomfield to augment his band, hoping that the kids would dig it. The result is a disaster, perhaps the worst recording Woody ever made. there are a few good cuts; Alan Broadbent was just coming into his own. Ed Soph is on drums. But that isn't enough to save this turkey. And Woody sings--way too much.Forget this one. Woody came to his senses in a couple of years, and had one of his greatest bands, which you can hear in Thundering Herd, on Fantasy."
2,A brief look at Scorsese's 1976 film,"This is a very short book that summarizes the plot of Taxi Driver. The author adds a handful of ideas along the way, ranging from the obvious (Travis Bickle is a borderline personality) to the questionable (when buying guns, he's choosing from a wide range of penises). It helps that the author is a woman. Her take on the violence and sexuality of the story is slightly different from the other (male) reviews I have read. However, there's so little here that is new, it's not worth buying. This would be better as a chapter in a larger book."
2,A flawed examination,I felt that many of the ideas 'behind' Taxi Driver postulated here were rather far-fetched to the point of being ludicrous. I can't elaborate as it's been years since I've read it.
3,"Yup, it's a single","It's a good little single to listen to, but there are only three tracks on it so one can't really get into it for long."
2,Silly,"The book held my attention for the most part, but ultimately I found the actions of the main characters to be unbelieveable. Read it only if you wish to keep up with the Doc Adams series."
2,average but works,"Nelly&Tim Mcgraw's voices blend really well on this cut. if you will, call this the updated ""On My Own"" the track that Patti Labelle&Michael Mcdonald did back in 1986."
1,What Nelly fan wants to listen to Tim McGraw...,"...and what Tim McGraw fan wants to listen to Nelly?The answer is: none. Give the artists credit for trying something different on here, especially Nelly since he always seems to be stuck in a rut of making generic hip-pop, but this song just doesn't work. At this point, you have to wonder what Nelly thinks he's doing, since he's not trying to boost his rap credibility, and (oh my god) Chingy is involved in some sort of wack beef with him. Not to mention KRS-one (an emcee worth about 999,999,999,999 Chingy's) is still on Nelly's case. It's only a matter of time before Nelly will need to look for a day-job now."
3,NOT GLUTEN FREE!!,"It was suggested that I try artichoke pasta in my search for gluten-free yet whole grain pasta. This may very be a FABULOUS pasta but I will never know because it is not gluten free. I must have ordered the wrong one I was having trouble finding any artichoke pastas that did not come in a 10 pound box, it is hard to commit to 10 pounds of pasta since so many gluten free varieties are nasty tasting!"
4,keep on spce truckin',"Nebula keeps right on track with this new e.p. I especially like the song ""Humbucker"". Featuring drummer Reuben Romano on vocals for a nice twist. The live version of ""Full Throttle"" is amazing. If you have been following Nebula, you won't be disappointed. If you've never heard Nebula, do yourself a favor and check them out."
5,Super Convenient,"This was the best purchase I have made in a long time. It works so much better than I had expected. I have two young kids (4 years, 7 months) and a Golden Retriever, so you can imagine how many spills take place at my house. The Turbo Brush really works great on muddy paw prints and spilled juice. I also use it to clean all the accidents that happen in my car. It is very easy to use (just add cleaning solution to the clean water and you're ready to go). It also heats the water/cleaning solution for better cleaning. This is a must have for everyone with kids or pets. I have owned other brands of cleaners before, but from here on out - I am a Bissell Buyer!"
2,I would not buy it again,"The brush works pretty well but the vaccum is weak. However, my main problem is that the sprayer stopped working after about 6 months.When I researched for possible solutions, I found that other users (from epinion reviews) had similiar problems with Bissell cleaners. Apparently the spraying units are poorly designed which means that the users need to run clean water through the sprayer after every use so that the cleaning fluids do not gum up the spraying mechanism. This information is not on the manual and was apparently given by a service repair technian.The repair cost is about what this unit costs new.I really wish that I did my research before I bought this unit as it's now useless."
2,Leaky,"Yep, it's a leaker. Listen, I take care of my appliances. You know how some folks just use something and then toss it aside till next time? I rinse out the hose, rinse out the tanks... wipe down the machine... you get the picture.This thing leaks. Not always, but regularly. And then you have that mess to clean up.Poorly designed.Look elsewhere."
5,An Amazing Product,"This deep cleaner has been a godsend on more than one occasion. It has never failed to remove a stain. Using Bissell cleaning formula, this thing pulled a grape juice stain out of white berber carpet. A+ in my book."
4,Bissell 17251,"I read the reviews on this after I purchased this machine. I think it does a terrific job for it's size. Although I haven't been able to suck all the water that I put down, it came very close, I just had to put a little more elbow grease into it. For it's size the suction is not bad. The dirty tank did leak,ONLY because there was dog hair and gunk trapped in hole which was an easy fix by pulling out the hair."
1,Great product until I tried to use it,"Poor design, the tanks don't stay in place, they are held to the body with a small plastic piece that breaks (often), I ordered several replacement tanks (can't replace just the piece) just to have the same problems. I'd suggest the Hoover or a spray bottle and a wet/dry vac."
5,Perfect for small spills and the like,"Being a pet owner and having small children in my house, I am all too familiar with the need of needing a shampooer but not wanting to lug around the whole machine. This is a handy invention that I use often. It is small enough to move around the house, but does a very adequate job of cleaning. Best of all it doesn't really require special cleaning products for its use."
1,Have it and hate it,"I bought this because between the babies and the cat I was always spot cleaning. The sprayer seems to only fuction occasionally, the dirty water tank drips and makes for more clean up, and if you use it to clean up pet messes it takes on an odor no matter how many times you wash the dirty water tank. The cleaner has a chemical smell and doesn't always get the spots out. I don't think I'll ever purchase Bissell products again."
2,Wish I'd saved the money,"I'm definately not impressed. I wish I'd invested in the Hoover upright steam cleaner with powered hand attachment. I bought this for cleaning my car, but went back to soapy water, rag, and shop vac. It just does not have the power. Delivers cleaning solution in clumps, then does not have enough suction to adequately remove water. Left light colored upholstry with (dirty) water marks.p.s. Just bought the Hoover, what an improvement!"
5,A Pet Owners Dream,"With a new puppy running around, and the housebreaking taking longer than planned, this Little Green is saving my carpets (and my sanity). I've even used it to clean some ""accidents"" that happened in the car. It's so convenient and easy to use. I especially like the Turbobrush (it works great on stairs). I also like the fact that it heats the water/cleaning solution for more effective cleaning. This is a must have for every pet owner. I don't know what I'd do without it."
1,Save your money....,"I have a 2 year old and thought this product would be wonderful for all the little mishaps that happen. I wish I had saved my money. The first one I purchased didn't work right out of the box. The water just came pouring out of the handle til the thing was empty. I returned it and got another one. This one worked, but it leaks and the sprayer gets clogged everytie I use the thing. I have already had to contact warrenty department twice on this item. They were helpful, but still frustrating. What sickens me is that I purchased this item to replace the Bissell Spot Cleaner I had previously purchased and had to stop using because it leaked so badly. I think I have learned not to purchase another Bissell priduct again."
3,Starts off great...,"I have just finished reading this book. It thought it started off great. the first chapter had me pumped up and ready to rock! But as I got into the book more, I lost that intensity, mostly due to the very dated content of the book. It focuses on data available in 2001. In my opinion, too much has changed since then to make this a great book. It has historical value and a wider-than-average geographical appeal, but many of the examples are outdated (some of the GREAT companies used as examples, don't even exist anymore). This book needs an update badly."
4,The two faces of evolution...,"The politic of supernaturalists versus naturalists is humorously tackled in this engaging documentary. No matter what side of this argument you are on, the interesting thing is that new scientific knowledge generally succeeds in corroding supernatural concepts as time goes by, and that is inspite of the fact that politics generally dominate educational systems and religion continues to dominate domestic upbringing."
5,Poignant take on controversy,I enjoyed this a great deal as a film that helps defuse the hostility factor in an otherwise inflammatory controversy.
5,A humor survey of cultural controversies in the evolution vs. intelligent design debate,"A humor survey of cultural controversies in the evolution vs. intelligent design debate, A FLOCK OF DODOS comes from a filmmaker and evolutionary biologist who makes fun of jargon, science, and religion alike. Viewers who can appreciate a quirky, different view of evolutionary theory will find this outrageously funny - and will pick it as an item of choice in any film lending library handling either science or humor titles at the general interest viewing level.Diane C. DonovanCalifornia Bookwatch"
4,Nice and relaxing,I did very much enjoy this selection it was good for the soul. Sanctuary was a great escape for the mind and body.
5,Music to quiet your soul,I purchased this CD to use for meditation and for use during yoga. I actually have found myself pulling it off the shelf to listen to just for the heck of it. The music is beautiful and moving. Wonderful to help someone center themselves and gain some perspective. Peaceful and haunting melodies filled with just enough of the unexpect to keep the listener interested. Perfect for meditation and yoga.
1,Unfortunately I read this,"I have been a Java developer, teacher, and mentor for over 5 years now. I not at all impressed with this book. I review books for clients and for internal use. If you want a good book on Java please say away from this. I have a strong suspicion that this guy came from RPG or COBOL. He demonstrates a lack of understanding of OO technologies (maybe this was done on purpose to get more procedural programmers to buy). There are many other books on the market that are better suited for learning Eclipse and Java."
3,Very very elementary stuff,"I liked the simple approach that is easy to follow and understand. Sometimes it even goes down to elemtary school level and you will run through the pages. However, I was really disappointed because it didn't cover any web application elements. The sample used in the book just displays the results in the IDE window."
4,A gentle introduction to IDEs,"This book is friendly and easy going, and as it happens I'm a big fan of friendly and easy going tech books :). If you're new to Java and new to IDEs, this will be a great book for you. The book takes you through the basic functions of the Eclipse IDE at a very leisurely pace. You can almost see the ""Don't Panic"" buttons attached to each page.If you're an old hand at IDEs then this book will probably not go into enough depth for you. The book is not a detailed reference to Eclipse, and given its mission, that's a good thing. Using this book, the beginning reader can really nail down the basics without getting lost in a sea of options.My only concern with this book is whether it's priced correctly. It seems that this publisher may be more familiar publishing books in constrained vertical niches. The pricing of this book doesn't seem consistent with other technical books in more horizontal markets like Java.In summary, a great beginner's book, if a little pricey."
5,Flora's Freedom Flight,It's about time that this jewel was released on CD. This was Flora's freedom flight in the USA and it contains the distinct bass signature of master Alphonso Johnson. This recording was there to help define the Fusion era and it contains the best elements of that period. The title track will stick in your mind for days. Flora is at her best chasing wordless vocals. Her voice is still pure bliss to hear. A great addition for lovers of Chick Corea's earlier RTF and Weather Report. Enjoy!
5,Still a great buy!,"I purchased this many years ago when vinyl was the only game in town. Nothing's been lost in translation, this is still a wonderful musical feat. Love Flora Purim - every aspect of her music is magical."
4,Much like the artist herself...,"...this album has aged well. I like it much more now than when it was released. And speaking of released, this is her comeback album after doing time at Terminal Island. So as you might expect, it's particularly joyous and free; two adjectives often associated with Flora. Although it has a much different feel, it shares with Wayne Shorter's ""Native Dancer"" Americans and Brazilians working together wonderfully. Hermeto Pascoal is dynamite here."
1,Worst Amazon purchase ever,"Shocked was I to find this safety triangle was PAPER! It has masking tape (on the public-view side) holding the reflective border on the interior triangle. It would flap in the wind. It would immediately be destroyed if in the rain. It is utterly useless. Even if I figure a way to affix it to something rigid, I don't know how to weatherproof it. Did I say worthless?"
1,Do not let the cheap price fool you.,"This unit died within 4 months of installation. It states marine quality enclosed in a housing. The boards might be coated, but the terminal for the wiring harness is not. A pin corroded for the accessory power wire and broke off. Jensen (ASA Electronics) would not honor warranty. Do not waste your money on the attractive price. I have replaced with a quality Kenwood that is certified IPX5."
1,This power cord FRIED my laptop.,"I used this power cord for about a month or two before I started noticing that my laptop was acting funny and it was slowly not charging, also turning off randomly and making funny noises.I took it into Geek Squad and they immedietely thought it was my power cord.They measured the amount of power coming out of the power cord and it was so much power that it FRIED my whole motherboard on my laptop and now my laptop is NO GOOD.It's broken and it has not been able to be turned on since then.They said they were suprised I could even turn it on at all with how much power was going through it.It would have been nice to know that Dell does not authorize third party power cords or else I wouldn't be in this situation.Do not buy this cord."
3,Something different...,"These are not the typical Caesar salad croutons, but nevertheless, still very tasty.The ingredients:- Not overly salted so the herbs really contribute to the flavor.- The amount of garlic is OK, so your loved ones do not have to eat these croutons along with you to bear your presence :-)- No dubious ""natural"" flavors were used.- The package states ""Product of Israel"", so the herbs really seem to come from a Mediterranean climate.- The size of the croutons is on the smaller side so they can readily absorb the dressing. Very important for me, since I am usually a little bit in a hurry when I prepare my meals.On the obvious downside is the long transportation distance from the manufacturer to the US, which is usually a bit disturbing for consumers of organic products. I also couldn't find a ""Best before..."" info on the package.Overall still a nice crouton variety."
2,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED,"Edward & Sons Organic Croutons, Italian Herbs, 5.25-Ounce Packs (Pack of 6)Knowing that I have to watch my calories I have been eating nothing but low cal foods for quite a while. Part of my diet consists of big salads and low fat Progresso soups. I wanted something extra that I could add to a salad and/or a soup. I decided to try these. They are extremely salty and aside from that have no other taste. I would not re order these again. I do admit that I do not care for salty foods but if salt is used the taste of it should not be so overwhelming. Some foods are understandably noted for being salty, anchovies, pretzels etc. I do eat pretzels and like them as long as I don't feel as if I put several tablespoons of salt in my mouth. I do not taste any of the herbs that I expected in a product which claims to have as one of it's ingredients Italian herbs."
2,Bissel Vacuum Bags,These bags are a good buy here at Amazon although the bags are way overpriced by Bissel. You get the best bargain in a very good vacuum then you pay through the nose for the bags. Plus the bags are very difficult to find in general department stores ...
5,But I'm not a crafter...,"and I bought this book anyway and I'm glad I did. My wife and I took a vacation in Mexico last summer and we've been trying to think of what to do with all the souvenirs. This book has so many ideas like the shadowbox table, which we plan to make. The only reason we haven't is because we can't stop looking at the pictures and reading the memoir pieces. I never realized crafting could be so purposeful and meaningful, the author really expresses that in her writing. So maybe I'll become a crafter afterall..."
5,Crafty Chica's Art de la Soul,I loved this book. I found the projects both diverse and interesting. Many craft book projects end up looking junky but these projects are works of art. This is one of my favorite craft books of my entire library.
3,A bit too chatty,"Okay, I was ready to love this book. I'd been to Kathy's website and I do like most of the crafts. However, it is long on personal dialogue and week on technical ""how to"" instructions. I still can't get the glass slide charm bracelet to work. Heck...I can't even cut the slides. So...I can't recomend this book."
4,Crafty,"I like this book too. You do not necessarily have to follow her instructions, it gives you an idea to adapt to your way of crafting, decorating. You can adapt all projects to suit your needs. I will try as many projects as I can."
5,Better than Grandma's and gluten-free,This gluten-free pie crust is easy to make and has excellent flavor. Don't tell granny I like this one better than hers! Just remember to pre-bake for a few mintues before filling--as you have to for most gluten-free pies.
5,Excelent Item,"In 1995 I convinced my boss (several jobs ago) to buy me one of these. When I changed jobs they told me I could keep it. I have taken it with me to each of my new jobs since and I still love it. Every few months I open it up and clean the sensors, rollers and ball and it is good as new. I even had a soda flood on my desk years ago and it got inside the case. When I opened it up I had no problem cleaning the entire thing. They never should have stopped making this."
5,Best book about modern jet fighter pilot,I have different language version of this great. Strongly recommand it to anyone who is interested in learning the way a modern jet fighter pilot lives and works.
4,Lots of info about being a Navy pilot but dull in spots,"Oddly, the book starts to flounder when the Gulf War begins - the ""war stories"" he tells are actually quite uneventful. The best parts of the book are when he describes the people he works with on the ship. He does a good job of bringing these people to life, and telling about his difficulties dealing with the higher-ups onboard and their intimidating leadership styles. That was very honest of him, but he didn't reveal much about why he decided to leave the Navy and go into business just a few years later. Overall, it's a good book. I recommend Bogeys and Bandits as the best Navy pilot book."
4,I was hooked on the very first page of the book.,"A spellbinding autobiography of a Navy pilot's experiences during the Gulf War. It was an eye openning account for me (I'm in the USAF) of the difficulties of aircraft carrier based operations. Although there is little discussion of Gulf War military strategy, this is a very easy reading, engrossing story that will keep you so spellbound, you will not be able to put it down."
3,Mostly Interesting.,"When not distracted, Baldwin delivers an honestly written and interesting account of his experience as a naval aviator during the gulf war. His stories of the missions flown are both interesting and thrilling. The problem, in my eyes, is that it seems like he spends half the book telling us all how amazingly wonderful his then girlfriend, now wife, is. Certainly the connection to home and family are an integral part of any miltary story, but he takes it way too far. He crows on and on about how this girl is the most beautiful, wonderful, greatest thing on the planet. I have no doubt she is, but I was trying to read a book about Naval Aviation."
2,could have been 4 or 5 stars,"Almost all harmonica books these days include a CD; this one doesn't and so becomes a below average product. Everything in the Mel Bay/Phil Duncan ""Complete"" series are of the same mediocre ilk as this book. They might have even offered a ""with CD"" or ""without CD"" option if keeping the cost down was the issue."
4,Good looking costume - if the money is right,"My 4yo boy wore this for Halloween and liked it even more than his previously cherished Batman costume. It's simple and only two pieces (the belt is separate). One of the lightning bolts on the headpiece partially detached, but that was easily fixed, and such is expected for these cheap costumes made in China. But with a red t-shirt on underneath (the back is open almost like a hospital gown, just not down to the butt) there was no discomfort. I thought it looked great on him and he certainly had no complaints! Very easy and fun costume."
2,Uncomfortable costume; not worth the money,"My son was very excited to be Flash Gordon this year and we could only find the costume online. Unfortunately, the muscle chest piece is very stiff,the neck opening is too tight and the legs are very long. The costume is ill-fitting and uncomfortable. My 7 yr old is avg size (50 inches tall 55 lbs and wears a size 6-7). We ordered the Medium and we are going to have to modify the costume so he can wear it more than 30 min. Not worth the money."
3,flash costume,"My son was so excited to get this costume. The sizing seems right on (I thought it might run small so I bought the next size up and it's way too big). It's going to be hard to wash this with the fake muscles. They are made out of some sort of styrofoam material, not stuffing. The belt is pretty flimsy, but the rest of the costume seems to be pretty well make."
5,chicken soup for sisters,I was bawling by the third story in the first chapter! This book is a real tear jerker.Another great chicken soup book in the series.A must to share between sisters and friends. There is a chapter dedicated to brothers as well. I would have to say this is probably the best chicken soup book i have read by far!!!
3,"For everyone, but not all of it","In the beginning, I felt the authors knew absolutely nothing about sisterhood, but as I read on, I came to appreciate having a sister of my own. Though some of the stories made me feel totally alienated from my sister, others made me wish I was closer to her. There were stories I could relate to and stories that I couldn't relate to, which is, I feel, how most readers will find this collection of stories to be for them as well. There is even a section for sisters who don't share the same blood and genes, and I feel that probably everyone would find at least a few stories they could relate to and like."
5,Best chicken soup I've ever had !,"As one of three sisters, this book brought tears of joy and laughter. Wonderful heartfelt stories that all sisters will enjoy. Take your time reading it to fully take part in each story and take note of how each story makes you feel. I learned alot about myself and my sisters while reading this book. A must have in any women's library."
2,Not Original Tracks,"The product has a lot to offer in terms of the number and variety of tracks it has, but after listening to them, I prefer the original recordings."
2,They're Not What They Used To Be,"Here's the bottom line: this is a good, rare edition to a Pepper fan's collection. The two live jams look as if they're a enticing draw but they're not that great. Apparently over the years, the Peppers lost the edge from their musical capabilities. Practicularly Flea who seems as if he traded his bass skills for better songwriting skills. The jams turn out weak and drawn out, but the remaining two songs are obviously a plus. These guys have done better...and they should start wearing more socks on their balls."
4,cartooning for kids,"While I happen to sell books on Amazon, I don't review too many of them. This book warrants a mention, IMHO.It seems like a great book to get started w/chapters include1- Materials & tracing techniques2- ""From head to toe"" - Body types and facial expressions3- ""Dressing your character""- clothes and character props4- ""Creating a cast of characters""- putting it all together.5- ""Cartoonifying objects and animals""6- ""Special effects and tricks of the trade""- creating cartoon sounds, movements, textures and speech7- ""Drawing a cartoon scene""- 10 easy steps to great cartoons fromrough to finish.This book looks like a great one, for those who are motivated to try and draw cartoons.Happy cartooning!books-from-mk"
3,omg! this isnt that good,okay the cover looks awsome the box it comes in is pretty cool i was so excited to put this in ym dvd player. and guess what it sucks! the lighting is terrible you can hardly see the band and it flashes all over the place the music is ok but you can t here the guys vocals really and its a dissapointment what a waste of money! buy death-live in la and iron maiden rock in rio for a good metal dvd
5,Maiden live in concert -awesome!!!,I rate this blu-ray 6 stars. Top quality video and top quality audio. Excellent editing. Less then half the price of a concert ticket and one I will watch 100 times. One of the best concert blu-rays out there PERIOD. A must have in any collection.
5,scream for me costa rica!!,"This is the best dvd (blue ray) concert from iron maiden, audio, sound, performance all is 100% perfect!!!"
5,Good DVD,"Love Maiden. This video is amazing on Blu-ray. Just like being there. I just saw Maiden play at the AT&T center San Antonio Texas the later part of 2012 and this video is like a reshowing of this concert. Concerts are over so fast, it is nice to be able to see them in action any time you like with the DVD and Blu-ray quality is the best. I highly recommend it. I am now looking forward to viewing the book that goes along with this."
5,Essential for Maiden fans !!!,"Amazing !!!Everytime when I watch the Show or the Documentary, I really understand what means the fan's passion, and for heavy metal there's no boundaries. Great Documentary and the Live performances too !!!Essential for Maiden fans !!!"
3,Lloyd Bartlett's tale is particularly compelling.,A must read for those who don't understand what psychotic delusion is.
3,How would you like to show off?Have you every shown off?,Have you every shown off? Well this girl name veronica does not like school so she shows offso her teacher can call her parents so she can go home instead of being in school. Veronica went back to school and got suspended for showing off. Veronica went back to school three days later and two days after that she got expelled.Veronica the show off it is a good book because it teaches you something that can not get you in trouble with your friends. Veronica shows off all the time. If you showed off like she did you would get what she got in trouble.It was a good book because it made me want to read more because it was funny and had intrusting words in it. It has a lot of pages and all of them had a big word on each page. That is what helps you in school you can use most of them words in school.
5,Great Live Album! Next best thing to being there!,This is the next best thing to being there. A great live set - reflecting JLL current stage show. If you are looking for a recent concert CD for your collection this is great. If you just want the hits or one JLL album take one of the Greatest Hits package. One for the JLL collector rather than the occasional listener.
5,WOW,"Sister Marie is awesome. Sounds like an angel singing in the orginal tones of the Christian Church. She sings the ""Axion Estin"" and ""Agni Pathi"" excellent! She really knows what she is doing with the Byzantine Orthodox hymns! This is a must for all people that love spiritual music! MUST BUY :o)"
4,Diffculty Decoding,"I recently completed the above named book and am still in the dark on decoding the Hieroglyphics. However,I did come away with how complex the ancient Egyptians were. I will once again tackle the book and probably walk away with the basic fundamentals of Hieroglyphics. I recently visited the Metropolitan Museum in New York City and they had an exhibit on Ancient Egypt, and to my surprise, I was able to decipher a small portion of the hieroglyphics."
4,Neat little book,"Sure this isn't an in-depth textbook on hieroglyphics, but it is a neat little book that's is probably one of the finest introductions for someone who doesn't want to study for years, but just wants a good general overview of how the Egyptian language works. I recommend it."
5,RED SHADOWS is nail-bitingly suspenseful!,"Yvonne Navarro's latest book, RED SHADOWS, is her best novel yet, adding to an already excellent body of work. Her characters' lives become part of the reader's, with the reader suffering with every loss and rejoicing with every hope as if their own. Along with the vivid characterization, there is more than enough action to issue this warning: Don't start reading this book just before bedtime if you plan on getting any sleep! Somehow, Ms. Navarro found a scientifically plausible way to stop the rotation of the Earth. (According to Dr. Ellen Stofan at NASA, as seen on TLC, one theory explaining Venus' retrograde rotation was a huge asteroid impact!) While exploring the ramifications of one face of the Earth always facing the Sun, Ms. Navarro weaves in some mysterious mutations and a nail-bitingly suspenseful plot, making RED SHADOWS a truly good read and a great follow-up to FINAL IMPACT!"
3,acceptable version,"short acceptable version of aristotle.i think it needs more information but to get an ideaof who aristotle was, it was ok without having to read 500 pages"
3,Nothing Special...But Not a Bad Gift,"Despite what some reviews say, if you want to simply project the clock on the ceiling in a bedroom - this works fine. The biggest complaint I have is the atomic clock won't work for me. The outside weather temp. is usually off by about a handful of degrees, but it's an interesting feature to have on a clock. Overall, this clock is worth the money and a fun thing to have for the person who loves gadgets."
4,An excellent instrument,This was the ideal instrument for us. We like to walk in the early morning - when the temperature outside is above 40 degrees! The projected time and temperature tell us whether we need to get out of bed - or can sleep in a little longer. The weather forecasting feature is also useful - and at least as accurate as the TV forecasts!
1,disappointed,I am very disappointd with this product. The write up says that it shold last for 45 minutes but after about 15 minutes it starts to run low. Not worth the price I paid
1,Not enough power,"After plugging this trimmer in, and giving it more than 24 hours to charge, I attempted to use it. It does not have enough power to cut through much of anything. I sent it back which means paying return postage. I dont recommend this trimmer. Better to get gas powered."
1,Can't Recommend This,"I am deeply disappointed in this product, and cannot recommend it.I am careful to recharge it for 24 hours, as the instruction manual indicates. The problem is that the trimmer only functions for 10- to 15-minutes, not even enough time to trim along my driveway. In order to finish the job, including the area around the patio, I must allow three days. By then it is almost time to mow again.This was a waste of my money."
2,You get what you pay for,Don't buy this product. I have a very small front yard and after a full 24 hour charge I only get 20 minutes of juice. Very disappointed.
2,Toro Trimmer,The handle pieces do not fit together firmly. Sometimes won't work due to the pieces not being connected. Was thinking about using duck tape to keep the pieces together. Any suggestions welcomed.
1,makes my hand ache-hard to keep trimmer on,"This trimmer works okay, but you have to push in the start button with your thumb, then hold it constantly while you pull the trigger with the rest of your fingers. I.e., the ""on button"" must be pressed in all the time or the thing shuts off. My hand started aching in just a couple minutes, so I have returned it for a refund.I am female, but not a wimp. In the past, I've owned a gas trimmer and another larger electric trimmer, and never had this problem. I have a Toro gas mower and just love the thing, so I was hopeful about this Toro product. If they could make the button stay in the on position when you want, it would be okay."
1,"Poorly balanced, weak","I bought this item so I could weed eat when my husband wasn't home to start our huge, heavy gas weed eater. I had high expectations based on other reviews. I was so excited! I plugged it in, unplugged it when the handy charger light turned green, and waited for day light. Then I actually used it. It pretty much beat my grass into submission, rather than trimming it. Don't use with St. Augustine for sure. Then after using for about 10 minutes, my back ached to the point I had to quit using it. It is poorly balanced and/or made for people under 5' tall. I can use our giant gasoline unit for EVER without causing back pain because it is well balanced. Super disappointed, returning item."
2,gift for wife,"My wife wanted a light trimmer re replace a 4 year old Toro. I think this one is a little ""weaker"" than the previous. It makes a small task a little larger. Good weight for her light trimming. Satisfied with Amazon experience, as usual."
3,Small Cordless String Trimmer - Toro 51467 8-inch,"Received the trimmer and tried to assemble according to the instructions but couldn't get the top and bottom shafts to completely come together. Got help for this one person job and we still couldn't connect the two shafts. Sent it back and received a replacement. Same problem with the replacement. However, it runs and I will try it outside when the weather warms up and hope it stays together."
3,Great for small jobs,"This trimmer is fine for a small yard and for small jobs. You cannot do any edging with this product. Also, if you have an arthritis in your hands this is not the trimmer for you. Very hard to maintain holding the 2 buttons down. I will use for in between touch ups, not the entire yard."
3,Toro,"I've always loved Toro products, they were a mainstay in the yard tools in my family. However, I recently purchased this weedeater, and I am not particularly happy with it. It is hard to get the line to feed, and the trimmer keeps spitting out line before it's even used. Plus, the line keeps pulling back into the trimmer and getting stuck, and the center is nearly impossible to take off to re-feed the line. I also don't like that I can only get about 30 minutes of usage before I have to recharge it for several hours! Overall, it trims well, but the product is definitely not my favorite."
1,Horrible waste of money,"I read the reviews and couldn't wait to get this product. Yesterday it came. I plugged in the charger and looked forward to cleaning up the light grass that i can't reach with my mower in my small yard.Finally this morning it was ready. I worked for less than 20 minutes and had to recharge. Hours later it was ready to go again. It worked for 5 minutes, maybe less. I charged again. This time it worked for less than two minutes. I rate it POS and will be sending it back. This Toro is Bull."
2,no access to changing battery,ran fine as long as it was plugged in. battery doesn't hold a charge so now it decorates my garage wall
2,OK only for small areas,"Just received it. Tried it twice..It only has a single line comming out of it.My property is aprox 4000 sq ft sod in Florida.It does Ok for regular grass around trees, steps, etc...BUT THATS IT..PERIOD...Charge holds 15-20 min. for small yard.YES its not GAS, BUT weighs same... Hope this helps..."
2,Electric Trimmers are not for any substantial job,"The rating I gave is not necessarily just for the Toro cordless trimmer, but for battery powered trimmers in general. I have always been used to using gas powered trimmers, which are able to tear through foliage. The cordless trimmers are for jobs that wont take more than 15 minutes and consists of light trimming. I have used this product twice and both times the battery charge died before I was done and it was on a full charge both times. However, when it was working it did a decent job of cutting through the grass. In hindsight I would have rather forked over the money for a gas powered trimmer to save from the aggravation of the weakness of the trimmer and the battery."
4,Cord keeps breaking and won't advance,----Update ---- I had the cutting cord wrapped in the wrong direction on the spool so it appears to be working correctly now. I'm keeping my fingers crossed. -------This is my second one of this model and the first one was great. I had it around 4-5 years and accidentally left it out in the garage in freezing temps and it killed the battery. On this one the cord keeps breaking off and when I tap down it won't advance the cord by itself whatsoever - so whenever I use it I end up taking the trimming head apart like 3 times to get it to work - very frustrating! Any suggestions appreciated.
3,Short battery life,"I only used this trimmer less than 15 minutes on and off and the battery was dead. I wouldn't purchase this product again. It's good for quick trimming, cannot to be used for a ""whole"" yard of trimming. This was even after the initial charging for over a day."
2,Better options out there,"I bought this model in 2010 to replace an older cordless 10"" B&D; trimmer. When I couldn't find the replacement battery, it was time to buy a new trimmer. On the plus side, it will trim light grass fairly well, but that's about it. The shaft is too short, so you have to stoop a little to use it. I'm average height (5'10""), so anyone over 5'7"" will likely find it too short. Also, the guard kept coming off every time I barely bumped into something. Tried various things, nothing worked. I have a fairly large lot with several trees, so this just didn't work for me. I'm on Amazon at this time looking for a new trimmer.This is fine if a) you're on the short side, and b) you have a small lawn with few items you might bump into. Otherwise, your money is better spent on a better cordless or a corded trimmer."
1,battery is no good,The battery only last less than 10 minutes after one month. I followed the instruction to charge the battery every time after usage. This tool becomes useless if you have a medium size yard to work with.
3,toro electric trimmer 51467 8 inch 12 volt cordless,The gaurd around the trim line will not stay on. My Mom and I both got one of these trimmers. My husband had to put a hose clamp around the shield where it hooks onto the trimmer to clamp the shield on tight to keep it in place.
2,Never worked properly/a real lemon,"I've had this product before and liked it, but this one is a lemon. The trimming cord never fed correctly, the shield pops off; I have to stop and re-tread repeatedly. Giving it too many chances, I missed my return date by a few days."
2,Not the greatest...,"I owned this product for a just little over one year and it already stopped holding its charge. When it did work, it was a huge strain on your arms for such a small trimmer. I have had gas trimmers that were easier to hold."
1,Cheap,"This is a cheap product, that's why it's made with poor quality features. The battery doesn't hold enough power and won't last you 20 minutes of continuous use, so basically it's useless under normal circumstances. I wanted to save money, but I ended up with a cheap useless product. Next time I need one I'll spend the money and get something good."
1,Horrible quality...unsafe!,"Very disappointed with the quality of this product...Toro used to be a name for quality products, but it's obvious that they have sold their name to be used on cheap junk.The safety release broke the first time I used it (!!!), so I have to be super careful around the trigger. The whole thing feels chinzy like it was made in a communist era factory in China. :(I would return it, but the shipping back to Amazon would be half as much as I paid for it!"
1,Not a good choice,"I have owned two other older Toro String Trimmers but the latest model imported from China is of unusually poor quality. Those who have experience with other string trimmers including Toro are likely to be quite disappointed with this one. It is advertised as a plastic 'snap-together' with no tools design.....true enough but not mentioned is the unusual vibration causing the unit to 'snap-apart' while in use. As a battery powered unit that is about as noisy as a gas powered model but lots more vibration with a fall apart in use design that trims poorly. It took less than 5 minutes to decide this would be going back.Save your time, money and frustration, -look for other models."
4,I like it.,"This is a nice, solid product for the money. The first time I used it I made the mistake of letting the line get too short and it withdrew into the spool causing a problem, but I quickly learned how to correct it. Nice trimmer!"
1,too many things to go wrong: buy a CORDED or gas model,"First the string didn't release when tapping as hoped. Then the 2nd spool wouldn't even feed out by hand, you have to unscrew it and unwind it every time it needs more string. The spring that goes with the spool gets lost, too, making this necessary.Then if you don't keep it charging, or the ac/dc charger wire gets cut and the trimmer doesn't get charge, it won't recharge. So you then have to replace the charger (if cut) for $30 and/or the lead acid battery (old technology and makes item heavier), for $??Just get a corded model or gas powered."
4,Toro Cordless Electric Trimmer 8 inch 12-Volt,Mostly pleased with the trimmer. A little heavier than I want and not as long lasting as I had hoped (maybe I'm just slow) but overall I'm pleased.
5,Electric Trimmer,iT WAS A GIFT FOR MY DAUGHTER AND SHE LOVES IT...The last time I checked with her she was very pleased withthe trimmer. and used it throughout the summer.
1,Can not be charged,The battery could not be charged. I charged it twice (overnight) and the light turned green very soon. Trimmer can not be used. Very bad experience.
2,Poor Battery Life,I purchased this Toro Weedeater LESS than a year ago. No battery charge at all. Probably used less than 15 times. Save your money and buy a better quality one. I will.
2,"It's handy, but kinda wimpy","If you have a small yard and just need something to tidy up the occaisonal weed, this will work. I grabbed it to use to wack fast-growing weeds between weekly trims (our HOA is horrible and would fine me if I didn't) while I try different herbicides to see if I can permanently kill them.It's a little too short-handled for comfort. I am 5'8"" and have to stoop a bit to use it, which is uncomfortable after about 10-15 minutes.It is wimpy and I think I could hear the bigger weeds laughing at it. It gets them - but takes a couple of passes, and it's pretty fussy at eating cord."
3,Cordless Trimmer,"I purchased this trimmer after years of dragging cords around behind an electric trimmer. I really like the cordless feature and the fact that this new trimmer can be plugged in after each use and remain plugged in until I need it. The battery doesn't have to be completely discharged to be ready to re-charge. However, this trimmer doesn't seem to have as much cutting power as my old trimmer. Tough grasses and weeds require repeated passes to cut completely. I wish I had paid the extra money and purchased the higher voltage model of this brand. I think I would be more satisfied with the higher power."
3,More NoisyThan Expected,"Easy to assemble. Holds a charge long enough to do what I need done in my small yard. Very convenient since I'm not not having to deal with dragging a long cord around the yard. The 8"" cut is less productive than my old 14"" weed trimmer, requiring more passes to get the job done, and it does not cut tougher weeds as easily. It is noisier than I expected---much more so than my old corded trimmer."
4,Works,"We wanted a starter trimmer; this fit the bill. It was cheap, wasn't too complicated, and did its job. Perhaps a big heavy but small and not bulky. Contrary to what others thought, the battery lasted long enough for 2-3 mowing cycles (we trim only around the edge of our rock landscaping and deck, so probably wasn't much). I'd buy this again in a heartbeat."
2,Disappointing,Trims pretty well but runs out of power within about 10 minutes - I can't get my whole yard finished in one day. It takes another day to charge - disappointed.
1,Would not recharge,Purchased to take care of the trimming on my one acre lawn. Assembled it and charged it according to directions. It worked fine the first day when I used it till the charge ran out in about 45 minutes. Plugged it back in to recharge it and after two days it still was not charged. I assume there was a defect in the wiring somewhere but was unable to disassemble it to look. Packed it back up and returned it for a refund. Amazon was very timely on the refund.
1,Absolute JUNK,"This trimmer is the worst Toro product I've had to date. This is my second Toro trimmer but this one is a night-mare to hold a button on the side and another on top of the handle AND actually use it as a trimmer. Cannot be ""tipped"" to trim borders while holding all these buttons. Chews up the grass. Going to take some ""down home"" engineering to by-pass these obsticles. It is real noisy and vibrates badly when it gets going (local Toro dealer says it ""sounds about normal""). Battery lasts only about 30 min (not the 45 min. it is supposed to last). Thank goodness I also bought a TroyBilt gas trimmer. The gas one is easier to use and not that much louder either.Shop around before you waste your money on this Toro. Toro's on-line customer service was in no hurry to give a (poor) response. They would really rather not be bothered after the sale."
2,Cheap step down from previous model,"Before I ordered this trimmer I owned the previous model, 51460. It lasted over five years before the rechargeable battery died. For the price I thought this was a great trimmer, so I ordered this more recent model. What a disappointment. The new model has a plastic shield that snaps on (in the previous model, the shield was integrated into the main casing - much more stable). Within about 15 minutes of use the shield was ripped off by the cutting wire - the plastic connector clips were snapped, making the trimmer useless. I have no idea why, but the wire frequently retracts into the spool, so it has to be opened and reassembled every few minutes. If not for the low price I would've given 1 star."
5,No problems,"I use this to trim two small yards, and I can finish both without losing any power. I recharge it after I'm done each time, so I dont know how long it will last, but I would think it would be plenty of charge for most yards. I am very happy with this trimmer. Considering how much cheaper it is then most cordless trimmers I have looked at, you cant go wrong."
4,Toro cordless trimmer,This little trimmer is lightweight and holds a charge for quite awhile!! And very reasonably priced.
3,Good for the price,"This is ok for a small yard and grass only. The battery will last quite awhile. The only problem is when you tap it to extend the line the line guard falls off when the line strikes the cutter. I use it without the guard because I always wear sunglasses for a little protection, also it is a lot quiter without the guard, the noise is pretty high with the guard on. In short it will get me through the season which is all I wanted. Update July 31st 2012: After replacing the line with a good quality replacement I am now extremely happy with the product. I recommend a star shaped line of medium break strength-what a difference!"
4,Great little tool.,"This is a great trimmer, but you will need the two batteries. I have to change the battery half way through each time. But it does have great power and it's not too heavy."
1,Battery Life is Horrible,The product will only work at decent power for about 10 minutes after just a month of use. Each time you charge the battery it last a shorter period of time.
1,Very Bad electrical connection between pieces,"Bought this from the Home Depot as it was light and cordless, charged it fully. 30 seconds into trimming the thing stops. Apparently, the two-prong connection between the top and bottom piece keeps disconnecting , as the lower piece slides down due to poor design/manufacturing. I figured it's a defective item and go exchange it for another one. Same exact issue -- the electrical connection between the two pieces is HORRIBLE, so either you have to force the two pieces together as you use this (bent over awkwardly and VERY unsafe) or... Well, I have returned this to the Home Depot and am NEVER getting another product by Toro."
4,Pretty Good for Cordless,"I purchased this product in the summer of '07 from Toro as a refurbished product. Since it was refurbed it was about half the price as it is here. Considering this is a rechargeable cordless product I think it is pretty darn good. It doesn't quite have the power to cut thruogh thicker weeds but works great for the grass the mower can't get. I have decent sized yard with a few trees and flower beds to trim around and this thing doesn't seem to want to run out of juice. My average use is about 20 minutes or so and it hasn't died during use yet. In fact I only charge it about every 2-3 uses. I have no complaints about this trimmer and would have given it 5 stars if it could go through thicker weeds, but I guess that can be expected with a cordless electric trimmer."
4,Toro edger...,"First of all, I bought this at Home Depot for $39.99. It's great for light work. I can't handle a heavy trimmer, and I think this is the lightest one out there. I had a corded Black and Decker, and the cord never wanted to stay attached, and even when it did, after about a year, the connection was bad/loose. Definitely not worth the aggravation. I much prefer the Toro. For thicker weeds, listen to the other reviews. This one won't cut it- (literally), but overall, for what I need it for, I'm very happy with it. It's quick and easy to pull out and use. Charge lasts about 45 minutes."
3,OK for small yards,"I purchased this trimmer to replace an old cordless Toro that finally gave out after 10 years. This trimmer is a big improvement over the old by being lighter in weight and well balanced. I'm disappointed by the short operating time and by the long recharge time. Even with a relatively small yard it loses power before I'm done with the whole yard, and the recharge time is long, about 24 hours. The cutting swath is very small but it works fine for trimming grass the lawn mower misses, especially around trees, fences, and foundations."
2,Too short for tall people,"I purchased the trimmer, charged it and went out to trim the grass. After ten minutes I had to stop because of a back spasm. The trimmer is about 1/2 the length of normal trimmers requiring a tall user to bend over trim the grass. I read another review, after receiving the trimmer, stating it was okay for a 5'-4"" person but probably not for a taller person. I am 6'-2"" and am too tall to comfortably use the trimmer. I sent it back."
2,Avoid like the plague!,"Okay, I'm not happy about writing a mean-spirited review, but Toro should ashamed of themselves for foisting this POS on the public.What's wrong with it? It's weak, so weak I could hear weeds mocking it -- and me -- as I came at them with this thing. Sure, if you stay with it, and hack away, the weeds eventually go down, but it takes for ever to do even a small job.Next, when you run out line, it's a pain reloading it. I kept thinking to myself ""it's 2012 -- they haven't figured out how to make this easier yet""?All in all, I'm VERY disappointed with this thing and caution anyone with a yard bigger than a postage stamp to steer way away from it."
1,Piece of....,"I am so angry. All set to do the trimming and within 30 seconds...no string. So, I took it apart, rewound the line, threaded it through and put it back together, which is very awkward and difficult to do in the first place. Got it all together and started again...20 seconds later...no line. What the? I guess nothing is easy. If anyone has a suggestion....If not I suggest a different brand.Update...went back re-wound and threaded a third time. This time it worked."
1,Absolutely awful,"This item is worthless. The first time it was used, it had to be charged again half way thru the weed cutting in my yard, which is a small yard. Each time the charge lasted less and less. Trying to use it for only the FOURTH time, it will not charge at all. You get what you pay for. Spend some more money and buy something else. This is a waste of money."
1,TERRIBLE,This product literally only lasted 1 minute and I'm being generous with that estimate. I promptly returned it. I will not be buying another Toro product.
3,Okay for small yards,"I've used it three times now and my preliminary thoughts are as follows:PROS: Rechargeable, battery has enough power for smaller lawns. Run time is adequate. Not too heavy or bulky.CONS: To me the biggest disadvantage is the 8"" length of the trimmer. It can't ""reach"" far enough. You have to put it very close to the item being trimmed for it to be effective. To edge the grass next to the driveway requires placing the bump feed head on the concrete to get the string close enough.I would choose another trimmer next time but it's not bad for small areas."
4,Ear candy with an attitude!,"Warning: This music will stick in your head! The Yo-Yo's combine great pop hooks and harmonies with driving guitars and drums. They have the pop sensibility of bands like 'The Smithereens' and 'Cheap Trick', plus they throw in some 'Ramones' influence to liven it up a bit.Several of the cuts are worthy of Top-40 status. ""Time of your life"" and ""Head over heals"" each have the requirements to be played by Casey Casum himself.Some have labeled them 'punk', but this disk has a lot to offer pop and rock fans as well. It may be a bit formulated, but it's a great formula!"
4,Punk + Rock + PowerPop = Yo-Yo's,"I bought this CD because I thought it was supposed to be punk. It's punk and then some. There's definitely a heavy rock flavor and some great ""poppy"" elements. I was listening to the disc and my wife asked if it was Cheap Trick. I took this as a compliment. I can also hear some echos of an 80's rock band called The Unforgiven. Basically, this disc rocks. Crank it loud in your car and sing along!"
1,How to become a corp. programmer - 20 years ago,"I'm almost angry at how bad this book is. Most of the advice is dated from mainframe days, and the rest is just wrong and following it will get you fired. Chapters tend to be short (3-4 pages) and consist mostly of stories from his friends, which aren't always developed past the telling of the story.There are a few good takeaways. Mainly, if you're going to be a corporate programmer, it's important that you know the company's business processes, instead of just focusing on building technical skills. Make your boss look good. For everything else, using common sense is a better guide than following the advice in this book."
2,"To the World's Best SF Author: Larry, this is a ripoff!","Dear Larry Niven: I have been a science fiction fan my entire life, and consider you the best SF writer ever, better and more imaginative than greats like Asimov, Bradbury, Clark, or Heinlein. I own every one of your books, except this one, including all the Known Space and Man-Kzin Wars.I think ""The Best of All Possible Wars"" is a rip-off, however, as every single story has been published elsewhere. I understand that you like to repackage stories, and I don't blame you, but every book should have at least something new!I hope you will take kindly this friendly admonition from yourmost loyal fan. To all others: you should buy all his other books; they are great reading!"
5,Not the usual Compay Segundo,"This was an expensive buy but when I saw the play list I knew I had to have it. I already own everything I could find by Compay Segundo and BVSC and I instantly knew this was different music. There are only a few repeats of songs I already have and the ""new"" stuff is fantastic. El Faro"
3,very traditional,This album is a great introduction to traditional sega music and gives an interesting perpective of the Mauritian lifestyle... I personally really enjoy this CD. I just wish the sound quality was a little better though.
1,Frustrating,"I took a chance and ordered two because my bullet kicked the bucket, but I couldn't even get into it. It's supposed to snap apart so one can put the battery in, but no matter how hard I tried, I could not get it open."
3,It's cheap,"It's cheap, and it works, but it's not very powerful, the plastic is not very strong, and it takes a while for my g/f to finish with this one, if at all, it is quieter then some other vibes though which is nice, but if you have a bit more cash get a better vibe, or a rubber dong."
3,What I was wanting for right now.,"It's cheep, cheaply made, will probably quit working soon. I bought it because it was cheep though so I don't mind. I would probably buy another."
2,Sesame Seeds,"I was happy to find that Amazon had sesame seeds, which are not easly found in my remote part of Texas. I bought three orders, they were reasonanably priced and came in 5 days. I planned to freeze the bags to use throughout the year. I was disappointed to find worms and webs in several of the packages. so I called to see about returning these contaminated ones and send them back. You replaced the six or so bags and they came quickly but three of those also contained worms. (this is not unusual, seeds do get worms and weavels) So this time, I just dumped the bad bags out for the wild turkeys to enjoy. I am still happy with the service Amazon provided and the attempt to take care of the problem. I have enough good seeds to last several months and am happy to have found a source. Thanks, Rita"
1,1 pair means one not two,one pair of hoop steps means one step not two. If you want a pair you must order 2 pair. Bad advertisment.
2,Where to get a replacement pen ?,"I bought this product 6 months ago. Unfortunately, I lost 1 pen. Lately, I had a problem with the note pad. Everything seems to work but all my notes doesn't appear on the electronic files. I wanted to change the cell in the electromagnetic pen, but there is no identification on the cell so even if I wanted to change the cell, I couldn't.So, I decided to purchase a replacement pen. After 2h of search on the WEB, I found nowhere to purchase it. So I end up with an electronic pad that is not working"
2,Great idea but not-so-good quality,"I love this idea. I hesitated to pay for a $100 notebook at first, but with Amazon return policy, I decided to give it a try. It worked well for the 1st 2 week I used. Too bad, after that, the black pen stopped working. Then I was afraid what was gonna happen next. the red pen ? the board ? So I returned it. Good for me."
3,P Comes Through For The Famlies,"If you liked Ice Cube's Are We There Yet then you should enjoy Uncle P, it is a good family movie and good for all ages but really good for kids. Picture quality was pretty good for a Master P movie also!!!!"
5,Uncle P review,"This was a great item. The sender sent it in a timely manner. I'm glad to have found this DVD in Amazon.com. It's good to know that so far, when I needed to look for a particular item, I can usually find it on Amazon. Thank you Amazon and my husband thanks you as well for having the DVD he's been looking for."
2,Kounkou runs out of steam,The CD starts nicely but then Kounkou appears to run out of steam towards the end. It becomes monotonously repetative with the same beats and chants being repeated over and over again song after song to the extent that the whole CD ends up sounding like a series of Jean Claude Van Damme movies. I would recommend other Kounkou works like 'Ras' and '380 Volts' instead of this one.
1,GSC76 - Stay away from,"Product didn't work out of the box, spent 90 minutes with IOGear support, no help on getting the problem fixed. I'm going with a better KVM, returned to Amazon for a refund, stay away!"
1,Lousy,"The description made it sound like self installation would not be a hassle, in the description it lead me to believe that it is compatible for 1997 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo. None of that has proven to be true and it is still in the box because anyone that knows how to put it on wants my arms and legs for it. A good way to throw your money away."
3,Great product Cheap Hardware.,"the steps themselves are great and the design pretty good alo, but the hardware they include is absolute crap. Its cheap stainless bolts that break very easily, the type of stuff you can pay .10 apiece for at the hardware store. I would recommend going tot eh hardware store and buying hardened bolts. For the bolts the go through the truck body itself. I would also suggest getting longer ones so you can place a piece of steel behind the lip to reinforce it. Makes the steps almost immovable."
1,Junk or NO Quality Control?,I got it working once over a short distance with the help of a null modem cable. And that was the only time I got data over it. These devices and my routers both automatically sense the wiring on the ethernet connection. I have to wonder if there is trouble negotiating between them since the indication lights on the devices seem to say that they are working. It was simpler to run 200 ft of wire.
3,EZ or Not Home Networking,"Well, it worked sometimes, it requires frequent reconnections, and sometimes will just stop during transmission for no evident reason. I understood that common AC wiring was necessary, but even with very close proximity rooms and wiring, it still was balky. When it worked, it was relatively fast, although not as fast as hard wired CAT6 runs, of course. We finally just adapted the Linksys wireless router, access point and linksys USB wireless devices on two computers and they are all happy campers, without the pluggy thingie. It's a great idea, and may work for some installations, but if you really want high speed and reliability, this is not likely a best solution for you."
1,Dead on arrival,Ordered two batteries. Neither one would accept charge. I sent them back for refund and after a reminder email got my money back (inluding shipping costs). I did however have to pay to ship the batteries back to the seller.I wonder what they will do with the dead batteries I sent them. Probably will try to sell them again.
5,v262 battery,"battery fine&quick servicei want to get off this servey and order a another partif your service was,iwould tell you help"
5,Amazon / A1 Accessories did me good,"Ordered replacement battery. Price was great, fast shipping.Battery is perfect replacement part and is working very well.Good company to buy from.Ordered through Amazon, but A1 Accessories is the vendor.This has been a good purchasing experience."
4,Good battery,The battery arrived in a timely manner and fit my phone perfectly. Since it was new it considerably lengthened the time my phone would hold a charge. I'm very pleased with both the battery and the supplier.
5,Motorola Battery,"I bought this battery to replace the original battery from my Motorola V551 cell phone. I waited this long to write the review to ensure that the battery was good and last at least 3 months. And it did. The shipment of the battery to me was quick and earlier than the date that they promised. Packaging was simple. Since the battery was an exact model replacement, it worked fine for me and charges properly for the past 3 months."
4,Motorola Cell Battery,This is an exact replacement for the battery my phone uses. I have been using it for a couple of months now and I really think it holds a charge better than my original battery did when it was new. The only negative is I expected to get this under the free shipping but didn't for some reason. Make sure you read the fine print.
1,"Arrived quickly, but didn't work","The item I ordered arrived promptly (especially considering it went overseas to an APO address), but when I put it in my phone I got an ""incompatible battery"" message. It was identical in every way to the original battery that came with my phone, so I'm not sure what the problem was. When I e-mailed to inquire about exchanging it for another battery in the hope that it was just a quirk with the one they sent, the response was that I could return it for a refund. Considering the postage required to sent it back would probably be more than I paid for the battery, I didn't bother. Buy at your own risk with the knowledge that the battery you receive may be exactly what you need, but still not work."
1,Crapped out too soon =(,"Well, I popped this battery into my V635 and fully charged it. I was hopefully but 2 days later, it is already giving me problems. My phone keeps powering off when there is still some charge in it. And now the battery is already drained and not working correctly even when I've got it hooked up to the charger. Fooey!"
1,You get what you pay for ...,"At this price ordered two ... shipping tripled the bill. But at $15 total thought I had a deal still. Took two weeks to arrive. When they did arrive, they were not only dead - but neither battery would accept a charge. Now they want me to spend the time and money to send them back. They have used up enough of my time and money. I'll find another resource."
2,Poor life,"I was hoping this would be a good spare battery, but compared with the original the life was very short."
5,Exactly as advertised,"I got this cell phone battery for my wife's phone. It was exactly the right battery, the price was right, and it was shipped/received quickly."
4,Motorola SNN 5683 cell phone battery,Arrived quick. Appeared new.Charge lasts about two full days then starts to drain.Would purchase again.
4,Long Life!,"No problems at all with the order & delivery of the battery. It lasts longer than the original battery when it was new. I was suprised that the battery is thicker than the original, so it makes the back of the phone stick out just a bit. I have not found that to be a problem though - the phone still fits just fine in my purse cell phone compartment and in my jeans pocket. It's much nicer to have the battery last for 4 days instead of 4 or 5 hours like my old one!"
5,Good condition for using,This bettary is good for my old Motorola E680i. I don't think that will be working so.
5,Cellular phone battery,I decided to try a new battery before buying a new phone and very glad I did. The battery works like new and the delivery was right on time.I am very satisfied with the product and service.Thank you.
4,Decent replacement for 8 bucks delivered cost....,"This item is probably older, sat on the shelf, but it has worked very well for us, remember that with these batteries, the longest life will be held by them if you charge them for 24hrs the FIRST CHARGE, leave the charger hooked up even though it will say fully charged....very important for long battery life!!!- tried and trued idea, came from NOkia rep). then the first few cycles drain them down almost all the way(not all the way) and recharge them fully. battery life is good, and we are living a 'normal' life again with the battery giving the phone life for 2-4 days at a time depending on how much it is used for talking and/or bluetooth usage. decent product for 3 bucks and then 5 dollars S/H! if u need one, get it."
1,"BATTERY IS USELESS, AND PROBABLY NOT NEW",This battery does not hold a charge for more than two hours. I can only assume that it was used before I received it. I have a three-year-old battery that holds its charge much longer than the one I purchased from this seller.
5,cell phone battery,"have been using this battery for about 1 month with no problems, holds a charge, charges with no problems, if it lasts it will be a great deal for the price."
4,OEM Replacement,Battery is the same as the original Motorola that came with the phone. The talk time is no longer or shorter than the original. A good replacement for your phone
5,Thank you for inspiring little girls!,"My daughter learned about Amelia Earhart at school. I was surprised when my daughter came home one day and was so excited to tell me about what she had learned about Amelia. She said, ""mom, did you know Amelia Earhart was a pioneer?"" I said ""yes, she was."" Then she went on to tell me about Amelia's accomplishments. I knew I had to get anything Amelia Earhart for her birthday. After searching online, this was the only place I could find an Amelia Earhart doll. I know my daughter is going to love her."
5,Doll Collector,As an avid doll collector I think this doll was a great buy for the money! This is the second doll I have purchased from this company!
5,Truly exciting and fascinating read.,This book is one of my favorites by this author and I really hope there will be more to come. The Blackhawk /Sinclair series are a truly read worthy series .
4,The Train Stopped Here,"Gustafson and Serpico have published two books on the depots of the ATSF in California. This is volume 2 and covers the Valley Division which is the area from Barstow through Bakersfield to Oakland. More than 300 photos, illustrations, and maps document depots, towers, and freight depots. Floor plans and elevation drawings are included for some depots. Modelers of various eras will find something here for them. Hardback, 240 pages."
3,The dissecting and displaying of thoughts and emotions.,"Elizabeth Jane Howard's career as a novelist has been long and distinguished. Her autobiography is due to be published in 2002. ""The Long View"" is one of her early novels, dating from 1956.The author adopts an unusual construction for her narrative. It might be called chronology in reverse. Instead of tracing the development of a relationship between husband and wife over a period of twenty-four years, Miss Howard begins in the present and reverts, stage by stage, to the time of the first meeting.No novelist known to me is as skilled as Miss Howard at dissecting and displaying the myriad flickerings and quiverings of people's thought and emotions in dialogue with themselves and in interaction with each other. Admiration of this skill is more likely to command your attention in this book than are the appeals of suspense, plot development and setting."
4,"Entertaining, but Little More Than That","If you're looking for a quick read (that mirrors those notorious chick-flicks), look no further. Lulu wasn't a bad book, it just was a little over-clich√©d in some parts. I didn't feel like I got very much from it...it was like watching a TV show.However, it reminded me of the Georgia Nicholson series, always a plus. It was a good laugh, but nothing worth buying or reading more than once. Definitely a good book to relax with."
2,I guess I found her unlikable,"I nearly put this book down after three chapters because I didn't really care that the self-centered, shallow main character lost her purse. And I'm annoyed with books where the kids are so much smarter than the adults in their lives - teachers, hotel workers, police detectives, etc. And the parents are virtually non-existent in the lives of their children. Those are cop-out cliches to allow the main character free reign to do as she pleases and solve a mystery that adults aren't able to.But I finished it, so I guess that says something. I was curious to see if the author could believably have this not-terribly intelligent girl solve a mystery. In my opinion this didn't really pass the believability test, but that's just me. I see plenty of people enjoyed the book, and that there are sequels, so maybe this is just not my thing."
5,a smart fun read,"What a wonderfuly quirky little book! It is the small things that made this book for me, the plot had its twists and turns and the overall story was imaginative and well thought out but my favorite parts were the small, seemingly insignifigant character traits that made the characters have real depth. Lulu's cowboy boots and fringe, Daisy's obnoxious mother and all the idepth descriptions of Halo City's funkiest establisments made the whole thing come to life. A hoot from begining to end. I cant wait for the next one!"
4,An unfinished story,"Written in 1966, the book recounts a grueling winter trapping in the Yukon wilderness in 1945 with her husband. For 8 months they had only the company of each other and their dogs. Its a real survival story by an intrepid woman but left me wondering what happened subsequently. I haven't been able to find further information about the author and the book jacket only has information about the co-author!"
3,Doesn't Last too Long,"This nail polish wears off very quickly.It doesn't peel off, which I think is a good thing, but it does just wear off smoothly.Also, it does not have a lot of shine to it.It is alright, but not for people who don't have the time for daily touch-ups.There are many nail polishes that wear much, much longer, for this reason I can't recommend this product."
4,A good sampling of early work by the leading Brazilian singe,"I enjoyed both albums thoroughly and they are from very early in her career, 3rd and 4th on her discography. So it is good to see where she started, especially when you know her later work. It is also a sampling of songs by other respected Brazilian artists. There are some unique arrangements as well, including a medley that includes a theme from BLACK ORPHEUS, the famous 1959 film. I recommend Maria for anyone who is interested in Brazilian music."
4,Quality cutting,"Been after one of these knives for a while. Very impressed. Smooth cutting style, very comfortable for me being a left hander - great one can choose the left hand version, compliments my knife collection very well."
4,Over 70 minutes of relaxing African compositions,"An album featuring a host of male and female vocalists, headed by Bozi Boziana, who compliment the guitars of Nene Tshiaku and Bello Bongo. The tracks are mellow and full of expansive vocal harmonies, which gradually build until the guitars take over for the finale (see track 4 ""Fifi Kibomdo""). Track 5 ""Tu es Pour Moi"" has a slower latin rhythm, and French lyrics, that glide effortlessly and inexorably towards the subtle but exquisite guitar line that joins the fray half way through..."
5,"Use with Iphone, works great!","These fill gap left by Apple not having earbuds that do what I want--like holding button down which gives volume and voice control, etc.. In general, I find these easier to use."
4,No Articles For Illustrators,"This book is a must have for anyone serious about entering or continuing in this market. It contains all the most up-to-date submission information direct from the publishers themselves. My only complaint, and its a big one, is that they seemed to forget about us illustrators when compiling the articles. How disappointing. It's tough enough for us that the Society of Children's Book Writers and Illustrators requires us to pay the same membership fees and conference fees while dedicating only a fraction of their offerings (workshops and articles in newsletters) to the illustrators. Now Reader's Digest Books (the publisher of this book) is following suit."
5,Great buy.,Took five minutes to cut the wire and attach pins. Make sure to have a small precision screwdriver set. Pins are skinny enough to fit through binding post slot.
2,Written in typical Fred McClement style...,"Which is to say long on drama, and somewhat short on and loose with actual facts. I've read three of his books on air safety now, and find all of them very lacking. Rather than retype my views, I will refer interested readers to read my review of ""Anvil of the Gods,"" also by McClement, as the same issues pervade his other works as well."
2,Too much salt!,"Way too much salt...the only other thing I could taste over the salt was the whole wheat flour. The buckwheat flavor is totally overwhelmed, like eating salty whole wheat pancakes."
3,Decent mix but gritty,"I made pancakes with this mix and they were fine at first, but my hand mixing resulted in a few balls of mix inside the pancake."
3,angel59,"Nice package, tastes o.k. Needs a little sweetner, like Splend or Stevia. It would probably make better waffles due to consistency. It is very good for you. This company has a wide variety of products."
3,I really liked the book It was like Liz and Amy were sisters,Amy's house burned down so while her parents look for a new house Amy will live in Elisabeth house. Really cool HUh! But evry time Amy tells the story she would exagerate the story more.
5,Awesome Mustang Book!,"Pat Covert's newest book, Ford Mustang 1964-1/2 to 1973, is a must-have for your collection. Some of the most beautiful Mustang photos I've ever seen grace its pages, and unlike any other Mustang book I've seen, Pat's book has the original color option sheets for each model year of the first generation. If you're a Mustang fan, I guarantee you'll like it!"
1,"Wow Disappointed No Mechanical Information, Over Priced","Save your money there are better books out there on old Mustangs that actually give some detail and pictures of Mechanical stuff. This book focuses on the exterior body, trim, and interior and for the most part ignores every thing else. For under $25, I could have got all of the information provided in this book and more."
5,Hellacious...,"On some levels, classical Tom, on others, deranged parapalegic Tom with rabies inside of a burning mortuary... if you're not already a fan of Waits, I'd sniff out something more accessible then ween your way into this piece, but it has some of his most stunningly raw music, and a few shining lyrical tracks--the folky epic Sins of My Father most notably."
5,Amazing,"I haven't even gotten into the lyrics yet, just the sound. And it is like an abstract painting: something to which you respond emotionally. Tom Waits nails it. It's blues, it's salsa, it's heavy metal, all mixed together, with that undeniable voice muttering nearly incomprehensible lyrics to this impossible music.This is one of those very rare truly brilliant achievements in music that are usually ignored and rarely found. Just get it; sit down and listen, and be prepared to be reduced to tears. It is that profoundly moving."
5,"Expressive, Funky: Waits","Waits is like no other -- this album is solid from start to finish. It is like night becoming daylight. Polished, yet never brags as such. It has a foreign sort of freedom and open road bass lines --Larry Taylor and Les Claypool compliment Waits' voice and song writing. (The flip book corners in the lyric booklet make you yearn for Tom et al to play live in your neighborhood.) For those of you who like early Waits, you will like this album, and a new generation may grab onto to this release and discover what fans of Waits' know and love him for."
3,Conjuring up spirits?,"Real Gone is definitely a layered, challenging listen.In many songs Tom's voice was mixed a little too low for my tastes.Tom is all about the songwriting...so not hearing the words defeats the purpose!My favorite tune is ""Make it Rain"" - a straight ahead blues, with vocals clear and strong. ""Don't Go into that Barn"" sounds like Tom is taken over by the spirit of Howling Wolf. Another strong cut is the Latin tinged ""Hoist That Rag.""The North Mississippi hypnotic style grooves ( R.L. Burnside) seem to be a strong influence (or maybe coincidence) in my opinion.If you're a Tom fan, this is a ""must own."""
1,Odd and Sad,"I have been a Tom Waits fan for over 25 years. I have bought every album he ever put out, and each had moments of genius which made the unlistenable slop worthwhile. This one, however, is pathetic. The musical backdrop to his screeching non-voice is even more annoying than the voice is. It is poorly recorded and the lyrics are like something from Eminem. I did not understand the motivation for the elaborate embossed quad-fold packaging until I heard what was inside.....nothing. Question: is his voice really that bad, or is this some sort of ""hipster thing""? Never again will I throw my money at this guy. Odd and sad. He was special once."
3,Tom Waits Tells a Lie,"""You can't deny / The other side / Don't want to die / Any more than we do""? This wishful thinking is sadly outdated. To the contrary, the other side's denial is a matter of public record. Recall the al-Qaeda tape boasting after the Madrid bombing: ""You love life, we love death."" I expected more honesty from Tom Waits."
4,Shovelin' snow and rakin' leaves,"Many of the tracks here are noisy, clanking, disturbing affairs -- like white-knuckle rides on a rickety old roller coaster that are exhillerating but you kind of want to end. On these cuts, Waits sounds like a cross between Captain Beefheart and Screamin' Jay Hawkins (""DON'T GO INTO THAT BARN, YEAH!"").But then there are other tunes in which stories are being told so well that the music is almost unnecessary (as on ""How's It Gonna End"" and ""Circus"").The song that grabs me the most, though, is ""Day After Tomorrow,"" in which a weary (and somewhat indifferent) soldier sings of getting home to the Midwest ""on the day after tomorrow."" My favorite line: ""What I miss you won't believe -- Shovelin' snow and rakin' leaves."""
4,not for melodic souls,"There are only two kinds of people in the world: those who like Tom Waits and those who do not. Among those who like him, there are two sub-groups: those who like everything that he does, and those who think that the old stuff is better.I am not sure the old stuff is better. His music has evolved over the years and it's hard to compare the new stuff with the old one. But the old stuff was easier to listen to. The old songs were much more melodic (melodious?). Somewhere in the 1980s Tom Waits' music got much harder to listen to. I read somewhere (unless i totally made it up) that he said that he's trying to reproduce the noise that he has in his head. It's often like the sound of metallic chains. TW's voice got much rougher too. Sometimes it seems the he's roaring. This is the kind of sounds you'd expect to hear in Dante's inferno.So if you're inetersted in how TW's music is developing, you might actually like this Real Gone. But this record is not for melodic souls."
3,not for everyone,"waits fans the buck stops here this is waits at the height of his experimental powers. this album has the power to take you places you have never been before. but, for most it is just a wall of incoherent noise. i suggest listening to it in advance. at the very least put ""make it rain"" on your ipod"
5,SUPERLATIVE!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Tom Waits really suprised me with this one. Turntable scratching, laying down beats of his own voice, and not a piano to be found. 100% genius. Many people do not have a taste for Waits' music, but if you do, there is no way to describe how this album sounds with a good pair of headphones, a cold glass of good Scotch, and a fine smoke(of whatever you choose). If you can, pick up this album on LP to fully absorb the quirky BeefHeartesque sound. If you like singing to Creed outloud in your car, this album is not for you. But if you don't and want to expirence a true avant-guarde artists' latest creation, then this lo-fi, jumbled mess of brilliance falls nothing short of amazing."
4,Takes a few listens...but it's worth the effort.,"I'm not a huge Waits fan, but I did enjoy Mule Variations and am absolutely addicted to Nighthawks at the Diner. This album takes some getting used to, and you gotta be in a certain kind of pensive and relaxed state of mind to really hear it all. If your tastes go off the beaten path without being unlistenable, this is a good Cd to check out.Has anyone else noticed that the track listing on the back of the CD is totally off?"
5,Tom Waits at his finest.,"This is by far my favorite Tom Waits album. Just Tom being Tom. Mule Variations, Blood Money, Goin' Out West; all fantastic but this one takes the cake for me."
2,Tom Imitates Life,"In someone else's nightmare Tom awoke and screamed and screamed and screamed. He felt helpless. ""Feed The Beast With More Product,"" Tom thought. No avail. But because he had never bitten the hand, the beast fed Tom and the public seemed satisfied. Now they are both well fed and fat. Tom, get out of my nightmare, Real Gone!"
1,Grating,"One long, painful primal scream of an album. Repetitive and tuneless with ugly lyrics. Instead, buy ""The Early Years, Vol.2"" for Waits's glorious writing and unique voice."
4,Dirtiest Waits record ever!,"This is Waits ""all stripped down,"" literally. If I remember correctly, he recorded some of the beats on this CD in his bathroom. How much more primitive can you get? That's what makes this such a powerful record. Tom packed away the piano and proved that he doesn't need those ivory keys to compose something poignant (""Day After Tomorrow"") or something that will raise your blood pressure several levels (""Hoist That Rag""). The only reason I gave this CD four stars is because I still hold ""Bone Machine,"" ""Blood Money"" and ""Mule Variations"" higher on my list.I agree with other reviewers when they say this isn't for first-time listeners. Check out ""Closing Time"" and ""The Heart of Saturday Night,"" both great albums. When you want to get a bit darker and a little more adventurous, ""Real Gone"" will be waiting for you."
4,Love it.,"True to the spirit of this album, I have a few completely different kinds of comments to make:I summed it up to a friend this way: Parts of it sound like a very good band managing to keep impossible tunes together in a semi trailer while driving along a really, really bumpy road.At first listen, I didn't know what was going on. I still found myself wanting to hear it again. So here I am listening to it for the nth time. I wish I could say that these concoctions are ""catchy"", but that's not the word at all. They sort of just... stick to you.This album is also proof that Tom Waits has some serious soul."
3,give it a chance - it WILL grow on you,"At first listen, only three of the tracks grabbed me (hoist #2, green grass #11, day after tomorrow #15) and by the second listen I'd moved my rating from one star to three. So that's where I am now...it could move even higher. This recording definitely improves with repeated listening.I wouldn't have believed it but I gave it the chance and it's true.So this is a discordant and clangy, percussive sound, little if any piano, but some tracks have some guitar I liked a lot. Closing Time is my favorite Tom Waits album, but it's not fair to compare this to that. They are thirty years apart I think and almost opposite. Real Gone might sound Real Strange but keep listening."
5,Roughly Brilliant.......,"Waits continues to conjugate images from the best writings of southern gothics such as Rick Bragg,Cormac McCarthy and ""Don't Go Into That Barn"" and ""Sins Of My Father"" are worth their weight in gold and strong arguments for owning ""Real Gone"".For the folks who have never heard any of Wait's well documented legacy, ""Real Gone"" is not a good starting point,only because to appreciate his art one needs to understand where this musical journey began and how it's taken shape and form in 2004.Amazingly creative and deeply insightfull, ""Real Gone"" represents the artist in full bloom."
4,...,"You have to be in the right mood for ""Real Gone."" Because this cd is as raw and as rough as it gets. Waits smoked a few more cigarettes and drank a few more shots of whiskey before recording this album... his voice has become even rougher (if that's even possible.)There are a handful of throw-away tracks that don't go anywhere... but most of these songs are well writen and delightfully fit into the overall Waits cannon.The elimination of the piano threatens to leave these songs hanging, however, in a delicate balance act Waits manages to keep them from tipping over. His vision is as explosive as ever, even when a song falls flat."
2,"Only ""Rag"" rings true","""Hoist that Rag"" is the only real gem on here, and it may be worth the price of the album--but it's not easy to listen to. Most of the rest compares unfavorably to his earlier work: think Swordfish Trombones+Bone Machine, both of which were better than Real Gone. Other tracks worth a listen: Sins of my father, green grass, make it rain, day after tomorrow. Sins gets a passing grade, but the others actually get predictable and boring. It's like Tom thinks he can just whip out the Waits formula and get a song. I think it worked better when he used to write in a hole in the ground or hold his umbrella upside down to catch the songs."
1,Practically DOA. Junk!,"This machine is nice on paper, and nice for the first few weeks, but mine died (won't power up at all) on the first day of the third week. While it was working, the screen would flicker if the brightness was turned below halfway. Disassembling the unit to wipe the hard drive, I find the design is abysmal. There is no reinforcement inside the case; any time you pick up the machine, you're flexing the motherboard.Now I'm out an extra $40 to ship this piece of junk to Averatec for repair and - IF I'M LUCKY - I will be without a laptop for 7 business days. Other reports I've been reading say it could be months.Buy a machine that was designed by experts and has actual product support, i.e. NOT THIS ONE!"
2,Averatec AV370-EH1,"Short and Sweet. Out of the box on day one. Dead CPU fan on day three. Back to the store on day four.POOR Quality! Neat little machine, but POOR Quality.P.S.. The DVD drive sounds like a Tecumseh Lawn Mowing engine running w/o a muffler."
2,Great Machine if .....,"You have an external fan to spare. It was lightweight and did everything I asked of it. The wi-fi was weak but I bought a Lynksis card for it.Then after two months the fan went out. After that it would overheat in a heartbeat. Using an external fan I was able to keep it cool enough to take all MyDocuments off it.Customer service was prompt and courteous. The gave me an RMA to return the machine at my expense.As I bought the machine at Sams Club I returned it and they gave me my money back with no hastle.When it worked, I loved it...When it died I was sad. A fond memory of a relationship gone sour.I'm going to try Dell."
1,Dont buy averatec,"Whatever you do... Don't buy averatec. After 3 months the motherboard died. It's now been over a month sitting in their warranty shop and every time I call for a status update I get a different story... ""oh, the parts are in, and it should ship within a day"" --- two days later ""the parts aren't in yet""DONT BUY AVERATEC!"
1,"Here today,gone tomorrow","Got the laptop on Thu.Turned it on Friday,CPU fan failed in a few hours,called tech support,their suggestion;return it to amazon!packed it up Friday, got return authorization and took it to the UPS Store on Saturday.I'm 69 and still haven't learned;""YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR""Ordered an HP DV1000 from HP today.GVC"
2,caused stomach upset,taste was fine but caused stomach upset to I couldn't continue to use it...disappointed in the product because the taste was good
1,What's the rush guys? Got to save on studio time?,"The potential is definitely there but these excellent musicians seem to be racing through every song. I can understand that with Octopus' Garden or Maxwell's Silver Hammer but not with songs from the heart like Something or Here Comes The Sun Perhaps they should get some soul first or limit themselves to children's sing-a-long albums? Take a listen, then like me, don't buy it."
2,I was looking forward to this?,"As one that couldn't stand NBA Ballers, I thought I would give this game a try.Pros:create a ballerNice graphicsCons:Defense? If you are a fan of Pheonix Sun basketball, you will love this gameThe announcer needs to learn ENGLISHThe whole ""I-Ball Trick Stick"" is horrible and will have you sreaming as you're stuck on the second side game that is required before you can advance on And 1 tourThat stupid mic trick that allows you to score 4 points with one shotStupid Watch This Trick that you can't stop despite the fact that you can still move your player. You can't even block!You can not choose who you want to face in other game modes unless you are playing two player.Guess which game I'll be trading for NBA Live 2007 or WWE Smackdown vs Raw 2007 this fall?"
1,Worst disappointment ever.,"Speaking as a die-hard And 1 fan, this game was a major disappointment. Within the first five minutes of playing, I knew this game was one of the hugest busts in video game history.Pros:......Cons:Horrible gameplay graphicsImpossible to score in a five on five gameDefense doesn't work against even the easiest of opponentsMusic sucks, of courseThe whole ""I-Ball Trick Stick"" junk is horrible; doesn't help at allShooting is too toughRunning around is choppy; almost unrealisticWhen dunking, hands don't even touch the rimThe players can't make layupsAll in all, this game sucks. I am sad to say so, for I enjoy the And 1 franchise. My suggestion: Don't even rent. Go buy NBA Live 06 or March Madness 06 for a much enjoyable basketball experience.Better luck next time, And 1."
2,Lacking on most games and especailly this Bull s**t game,"Ok let me break itdown for you. The Game isn't all thatb great, infact it sucks on ice, but the only reason i am giving this game fear grade is because of the year. Really you really can't blame them that made this game. The Fact Is 2006 is one of the worst years. there just throwing all the game at your face and they arent really that great. we see about 90% of games and movies arent doing that good. so my suchest is wait to 2007 when the PS3 and the wii comes out. I Promise you that year want disoponte. So dont buy every thing in 06, wait till 07. Dont waiste your money"
4,"Modeling of Business Systems in the ""real world""","Agile modeling is about the latest approach to the modeling of Business Information Systems. This book focuses on the Agile method and also describes how to incorporate the strong points of UML. The book will be an aid to ""survive"" in the jungle of developing modern BI Systems. There are IT decision makers that are not aware of Agile, since Agile is a mind shift, be careful how you introduce the new ideas to these decision makers. The book is for the IT professional (all levels), who wants to be in the forefront of software development. If you are in the ""nuts and bolts"" of systems development, do yourself a favour and look also at ""Agile Database Techniques"", by the same author."
2,Spend your money elsewhere,"Although I do believe that Mr. Ambler knows his stuff, I'm thinking he should consider changing his last name to Rambler!This book could probably convey the same ideas in a white paper, and would take the reader a lot less time to get through.Unfortunately, most of the book states common sense ideas (like only write documentation if somebody is going to read it, or think before you use your fancy CASE tool when drawing a diagram) but takes dozens of pages to explain them.Look to books by Martin Fowler instead - they have a lot more meat!"
2,Pretty useless,Not much information other than what you can read on his website. I was looking for something much more prescriptive in terms of how to model in an agile way and how to communicate the model.
2,So many words - so little to say!,"Although this is a painfully repetitive book, the author does have a few interesting things to say. However, most of it is common sense, and if you've been modeling for any length of time you are likely to be familiar with this stuff.The worst point about this book is that it doesn't discuss Model Driven Architecture (MDA). This is the latest initiative from OMG, and the future of UML. In fact, agile modeling practice seems to run counter to MDA in several important areas. In light of MDA, agile modeling seems to be quite a bad idea!I think Scott Ambler doesn't do himself (or his readers) any favours by stretching out what is really a very lightweight topic to fill such a large book."
2,Chico mendes-Not worth it!,I could not get into the book at all. I found the start quite interesting but in the end Chico was killed which made it a very upsetting book for me. I like happy endings. Long may we honour Chico Mendes.
5,My MAN watch,"VERY COOL. BOTH CLASSIC AND MODERN, MATURE YET FUN.WORKS BOTH FOR DRESS AND CASUAL.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."
1,"Slow, lack of documentation, poor product","Ever see that deal that appears too good to be true? This is one of them. If you only want to hook one camera up to it, it seems to almost produce 1 fps.Don't even try 2, 3, or 4 cameras. Using 4 camera inputs brings the frame rate to 10 to 12 seconds until it locks up.Documentation is not available.Oh yeah, forgot to add. It looks nothing like the picture.Run...Run away from this product"
1,x-guard usb 2.0 review,"The product pictured does not match what I received. However, it does have the same name. I ended up returning the product due to poor performace. With just one camera hooked up the picture was choppy with poor frame rates. More than one camera rendered it nearly unusable."
2,inconsitent,"I think a portable device to check one's breath is a great idea, however, as it turned out Tanita HC201 Breath Checker will give very different results (from No Odor to Slight Odor to Moderate Odor to Strong Odor) depending on how hard you exhale, how wide you open your mouth, the exact position of the device and even on the position of your tongue. This makes the device essentially useless. The reason I gave it 2 stars is because it's a ""cool idea"". Hope they will improve it, e.g. make it into a whistle-shaped device, and normalize against the amount of air going through it or something."
1,Something stinks!,This product is supposed to quantify the odor of your breath and let you know if it stinks...but it's actually the breath detector itself that stinks!We attempted a repeatability study and found the unit to give inconsistent results even though the tests were performed within minutes of each other. Save your money and buy a good toothbrush!
4,Lost in Space....,"Continued from Morbus Gravis I, Druuna meets the ancient ""Lewis"" and learns the secrets of the ""city"" and the ""upper level"". Alerted to the threat of impending danger, Druuna returns to the city she knows, guided my Lewis, where she is entailed once again in a web of lust and danger. As the city moves and shifts around her, will Druuna ever be able to reach her goal or contact Lewis again? Can she face and escape the ""lower levels""?Once again, Serpieri creates a fantastic story that more-or-less closes the arc begun in Morbus Gravis I. His artwork continues to get better. We meet many new characters as well as revisit important ones from Morbus I, anyone interested in ""Druuna"", should get these two great volumes."
2,Arab bashing?,"I was enjoying this book a lot--Gilchrist is a fine writer--and then suddenly, in the chapter titled ""On the Problem of Turbulence"" (pages 52-83 in the hardcover edition) the author launches into a session of gratuitous bashing of Arabs and Moslems. I am a trained reader, and I reread this section several times looking for irony or some other reason for this, to me, offensive section, and I could find no explanation for it. It ruined the book for me. I wonder what the author was thinking?"
1,Extremely Low Lighting,"I bought these to try them. And thought I would eventually replace all the cords in each village house, but even with batteries, the light is very dim and did not last through the holidays in the village. I will not use them again. I will stick with the cord and light bulb ones."
5,Great customer service,First one was defective and company sent out a second one right away. I have had one in the past and it looks so cool.
1,BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD,"After 1 year of service: The letters are glued on plastic, they start to fall off within 2 months. It would be better if the letters were epoxy filled. The chrome finish has held out very well. Bottom line- not worth it."
4,"Very nice style and examples, but annoying omissions...","This book is extremely well written, is set at a beginning-to-intermediate level, is attractively presented, and has historical footnotes thrown in as interesting diversions. It does a great job at illustrating fundamental ideas, such as the difference between lumped and distributed circuit analysis, where a diagram of a resistor and waves with various wavelengths are used to make the point. However, it is annoying that he does not cover oblique incidence of waves (only normal) or dielectric waveguides or antennas. He placed that in a 2nd electromagnetic waves book. This might make sense for a two year sequence in a university. However, his lack of inclusion of these topics make it hard to recommend the book as complete. It is more like volume 1 of a 2 set volume."
3,A book with faults and limitations,"The biggest disappointment about this book is the use of the same r throughout the book for the distance to the z-axis in the cylindrical coordinate system and for the distance to the origin. This is not only confusing but also can lead to wrong results. The advantage of discussing transmission lines (a third of the book) before electromagnetic fields is debatable. The electromagnetics part covers only waves at normal incidence and rudimentary treatment of parallel-plate and coaxial lines. No rectangular or circular waveguides, or antenna systems, or other engineering applications are discussed. Why then is the title ""Engineering Elecrtromagnetics?"" The authors' presentation and the book format are, in general, good."
3,Good product but a little pricy,"I used this for a few months to give it a fair chance but wasn't seeing any difference, expecially for the price. I came across a new product line from watching a Dr. Oz show called Paulas Choice and have been using that line for several months now and have acually had some compliments on my skin. It's more affordable and the products are high in quality antioxidants. Hope this helps!"
5,Squeaky Clean,"I love this mouse and the color makes me happy, but best of all I've just discovered how hardy it is. Not that I recommend this, but the USB receiver part of my set just came back from a tour of duty in the washing machine and tumble dryer...and worked! I was pleasantly surprised, to say the least."
5,Ninivaggi (Florida),Wonderful notebook mouse. Easy to install and easy to use. Love the color. Highly recommended.
4,Good,The mouse runs preety good.The only problem is that the receiver is of bigger sze.If it is possible to reduce down the size or get it inbuilt inside the mouse that would be excelent.
5,SENIOR TO THE CELESTINEPROPHECY,A DEEPLY METAPHYSICAL NARRATION THAN WILL TRANSFORM ANY CONSCIOUSNESS THAT IS READY TO DIVE INTO THE DEPTH OF HUMAN EXISTENCE
4,the best way to complete Luigi's first adventure,"The luigi's mansion prima guide by Brian Stratton is very well organized and contains every secret of the game.It's divided in four sections: one pro each Area of the mansion;it describes every potrait ghosts and the way to suck it up. Every boo is revealed. At last there are very nice 3D maps of the various floors of the house.If want to complete at the 100% the game,I suggest you this book without doubts"
2,A GUIDE FOR LUIGI'S MANSION???!!!!,Why would you need a guide for Luigi's Mansion. It's not that hard of a game. Trust me. It is a great game. but u don't need to waste 15$ on a guide? if you really need it u can get it for free on the internet. Go to videogames.com. The only reason I give it 2 stars instead of a big ZERO is because of the MAPS AND THE PICS you can hang in your room if you are a Luigi Freak!!!
3,Good descriptions of shows past and present at the time,"Overall I felt that the descriptions should have been longer, but they were in depth of actual experiences of people on game shows. For example when it talks about The Price Is Right, Maxine Fabe describes one lady's actual experience on the show. The lady wins her pricing game and the showcase. The prizes include a living room group, $1000, and a new car. Also I felt that there should have been more pictures, but overall I gained some insightful informatio"
2,"Nice Pictures, but English is very poor!","I was given this book as a gift for my birthday. I was very exited, because I was born in the beautiful country of Ecuador and had travelled the same area that the book dipicted. The cover is very nice, it grabs your attention right away. As soon as I started the book I realized that it was in English and Spanish. I was very disapointed that the English portion was written very poorly; like it was done by someone who was not fluent in the language. I believe that if you are going to publish a book and charge so much money for it, it should at least make sense when you read it. I do say that the Spanish portion was fine, but I pity the poor English only reader who buys this book. All of this said, if you are looking for a nice book of postcard fotos, this is the book for you."
5,good buy,"I bought this exact cage about 12 years ago. It has 3/8"" wire spacing and it is perfect for multiple parakeets. I keep 4 parakeets in it and clip the big door open daily so they can fly around and play on the big flat top. I put a bunch of toys up there and they delight in throwing them off. The large door makes it easy to change out toys or catch a bird. The big door has a safety rod that drops in and securely latches. The only drawback is the horizontally ridged plastic perches that come with it, the birds feet slip on them so I replaced them with various sized dowels and birch branches.The plastic bottom on my cage is finally starting to get brittle and cracked, so its duct taped together for now. I am thrilled to find this on Amazon and will be purchasing another one. I hope it lasts as long as the last one."
1,Never again,"I received this item in abominable condition with perches shredded, cage walls warped and the clips to hold the cage levels together snapped off. Since thepackaging was in such good shape we determined that this item has sat out ona shelf for some time and certainly was not inspected before being shipped.I intended this as a birthday gift for my Grandson, and since his birthday is on Monday and we have no way to purchase another large cage before then I have twofamily members who are trying to ""jury rig"" this together so he can put his birds in it temporarily. I am outraged that an item in this condition was sent out.No, I would NOT recommend purchasing anything from this company at all."
1,Not That Great,"I was very disapointed with this soundtrack. The rap and rock songs seem to have nothing to do with the actual X-Men show. Another thing-why are explicit songs on a soundtrack for a KIDS show? The overall best part of the soundtrack was the interviews with Stan Lee. Personally, I don't think this soundtrack is worth your money. If you want a good soundtrack having to do with X-Men, then consider the soundtracks for the first and second X-Men movie. They are very good and capture what X-Men is really about."
2,Piss Poor Arrangment Of A Soundtrack,"First... What the Hell were they thinking when they lined up the tracks on this album?Second... What the Hell Does N!ggaz & Gatz got to do with the X-Men? Someone needs to buss a cap in the @ss of the person who allowed this crap to be put on the soundtrack. Were they that hard up for filler tracks?I admit there are a few descent tracks on the album including the music score and the Interviews... of course... but the album in general needs to be re-released with some tracks dropped altogether, they just don't fit!"
5,FASCINATING!,"Part of the Bachelors & Babies series.Wonderful characters with Lieutenant Commander Pete ""Mac"" Mckenna and the lady he left behind Rachel Grant. His son, P.J., Peter James, whom he has not met and Rachel's friend, Chloe, a firey, fiesty, artsy person who is in love with Rachel's boyfriend.Don't pass this up and you will enjoy all the time it takes to read it. Recommended with a --M."
4,Good Story,I love Navy Seals! This is a good story and doesn't require a huge investment of time to read it. I was able to read it in one evening. The characters are interesting and from the beginning I was rooting for Mac. The author does a good job of pulling you into the story. I would recommend this to all my reading friends.
3,it's okay,"it's okay,he talks in circles and allot about himself i do not or would not tell anybody about it,just an opinion"
3,"some good songs, but I expected some merengue on this album","I am a fan of Melina Leon, but why are all our merengueras starting to sing ballads and pop. We love them for their merengue. I mean they can have 1 or 2 ballads, but their is not 1 single merengue song on this album. I did find some good songs on here. Si Tu Te Vas is probably the best song on this album. It has a nice beat to it. The other good ones are Quiero Ser Tuya,Encadenado, and Demasiado.Hopefully she will have some merengue on her next album."
5,A Gorgeous collection of Spicy Stories from the golden days of yore!,"Hot Pulp! features 7 Complete Spicy Stories, a section of photographic art studies and a beautiful section of gorgeous pulp covers, all from such Spicy magazines as Tattle Tales, French Capers, La Paree, Saucy Stories, Bedtime Stories, Stage and Screen Stories and Gay Parisienne! All from the fabulous 1930s, the era when pulps were golden."
4,Gettysburg: This Hallowed Ground,"Gettysburg: This Hallowed Ground, by Kent Gramm and Chris Heisey, is a short book of poetry and photography centering on the battlefield at Gettysburg, site of one of the most pivotal battles of the War Between the States. Each page is filled with pictures that leap out at you and words that tug at the heart, combining to create an experience almost as meaningful as it must be to actually visit that now sacred place. As one reads, a sense of history flows from the pages to the mind, describing the place so incredibly well that, at times, one can almost hear the gun- and cannon fire - as well as the screams - and smell the powder. Mr. Gramm and Mr. Heisey have created a wonderful memorial to that field and the men who fought, bled and died there with this book."
4,looks great!,"I'm using this bag to go to the gym and it's the perfect size. I can carry all I need, a towel, shoes, etc. The only problem is the fact that there's no shoulder pad on the strap. Other then that as very good purchase."
4,Great bag,"This bag is a great little bag. Really well made and super compact. As long as you don't need to put much in it, it's a perfect gym bag.I was hoping to fit a full sized basketball and size 12 basketball shoes in it. Even though that all surprisingly fit, it was too cramped and made the bag bulgy. I ended up returning it and getting a Ogio Gymbo Duffel Bag, which work much better for my needs."
5,Perfect For Swim Class,"I purchased this item originally for use at the gym but now I'm using it for my swim class and I love that it can fit two full sized towels, a change of clothes, a small makeup case and toiletry bag, as well as a water bottle and my flip flops. Plus there's still room to spare. I love the IPod pocket with the audio port. This bag doesn't have any inside pockets but I always wrap my wet clothes up in plastic bags and everything works out fine. I also love that this bag is pink and doesn't look like a man's bag. I'm very happy with my purchase."
5,bag it,a great bag at a great price .. not too large nor too small; holds a change of clothes and shoes w/o any difficulty
3,not a big deal,This bag is just a sack with a zipper. It has one small outside pocket but none inside. It has no structure. If you are looking for a nylon bag-sack with a zipper it will be fine but don't get too excited about it. I will give it away soon and buy something else that has some rigidity and compartments. I don't mind if it is 8 oz heavier.
3,Softer than anticipated,"I ordered this bag expecting it to be somewhat study so that it would keep it's shape. I don't like swirling my hand around inside trying to find items. But it is a soft bag without even a light plastic insert to provide stability to the bottom. Anything of weight causes the bag to collapse upon itself when you pick it up. The only pocket is on the side. Other than heavy material and durable zippers, I did not find this bag to offer anything more than much cheaper bags."
5,HAPPY CAMPER I LOVE THIS BAG,I AM VERY HAPPY WITH MY PURCHASE. LOTS OF ROOM FOR EVERYTHING I NEED IT FOR AND THEN SOME.
3,Useful,I have not really feelings on this item. It served the need and the pricing was bad.I guess that okay
3,Decent size but it smells...,"The size of this bag is exactly what I wanted. I just needed to be able to fit a pair of shoes and my work out clothes. Like another reviewer mentioned, the smell of this bag is pretty awful. I have sprayed it with fabreeze and aired it out outside but the smell is still pretty strong. I'm hoping that while I use the bag the smell will subside."
5,"Delightful, spirited renaissance Christmas program.","This is a delightful, spirited renaissance Christmas program. The instrumental ensemble of strings, lute, cittern, recorder, etc. plays in the style of the Baltimore Consort. Vocalist Sandra Simon has a sweeter voice than the Baltimore Consort's singer -- she sounds like an angel. Highly recommended."
4,"Fast, Good graphics, Quiet, but some system crashes","I put this card in a new AMD dual core system. It is the card you want if you do a lot of graphics work, video conversion, etc., because the card has everything you need built right in including the TV tuner. It comes with connectors for everything that you might want to hook up to it (TV, Radio, Video camera, etc.). The one glaring exception is that the unit comes without a DVI connector for CRT monitors. Why include all the other stuff and leave out a $2.00 part that many of us will have to have?For the most part the card works well, and graphics are fast enough for everything I do. One problem that I have had is that the card and/or software associated with the card causes occasional system hang-ups and crashes. I suspect a conflict with something else on my system, but have so far been unable to localize the problem."
2,Trouble from the start,"Unfortunately for me my card did not work at all and had to be RMA'd for repair or replacement. Then when I did get a working card back, I'm still having difficulties with the software installations; although that is partly due to my running WinXP Pro x64 Ed. I wouldn't discourage buying one if you are still running a 32-bit version of Windows, but as of right now they only appear to have the basic drivers for x64."
2,Is this the right size ??,"The Dimensions for Product# 1065549 on the Amazon site say 21 x 14 x 5. The actual size, as stated on the pan, are 16-1/8"" x 11-1/8"" x 3-5/8"". This is a little smaller than I expected. I am wondering if Bakers Secret makes a bigger pan (which I was hoping to get)..at any rate, the Amazon Site is in error in regards to its published dimensions."
5,great product at a remarkably low price,"This is a terrific pan for almost anything. I love the quality, the fact that it is non stick, it washes and cleans easily, I use it all of the time. It is of a heavier weight that is not found in most stores, so I know it will last me a long time, and what a great price too. You will not go wrong with this pan. I love it."
3,Roaster pan.,"This pan is a good size and weight, but I didn't realize it has ridges on the bottom, which was not made clear in the product description. If you are cooking meat, the ridges can cause the meat to brown unevenly."
5,About the Hardcover Edition...,"A handsome and comprehensive book: hardcover, cloth over boards with a sewn binding, released with dustjacket.216 pp on quality stock, 2.75 pounds.

5,A must before taking the trip to Peru!!!!!!,"I wish I had purchased this book before my trip to Peru. You could say I went ""cold turkey""!!! After coming back I purchased the book and what I read I lived!!! Most of it was what I had experienced!! Luckily I had my Peruvian friend with me or else I would have been lost big time. I recommend anyone one to learn what is out there to read for any country before traveling outside of USA...Very helpful."
1,"incomplete, disorganized information","i always use Lonely Planet guides when planning a trip (mexico, costa rica, hawaii, germany so far) and love them. i tried Lets Go for peru but was very disappointed. i found the information incomplete, occasionally inaccurate and definitely disorganized. by the end of the ten day trip, my three friends and i were all complaining about the book. i will definitely buy a Lonely Planet guide for my next trip!"
3,"Ok, BUT","The directions are not for a child. So the beginning steps are somewhat difficult. trimming and decorating were easy, but the felt will soon be stretched to an unrecognizable shape."
5,Great Kitchen Cookware,This pan is great for making risotto among other things. This size and shape is hard to find in retail stores.
5,Lodge Enamel Casserole,This is a beautiful graduated blue color. It is heavy and a good heat conductor.
4,Not bad for the price,"For what i paid for it, this isn't bad, but i have an enamel cast iron dutch oven from Le Cruset which is much better. The enamel is thicker and when i burn something in it, it comes off. When i burned something in the Lodge, it left a permanent(and growing)brown spot where some of the shine of the enamel is gone and things stick to that spot even more now. If i absolutely couldn't save up for another Le Cruset, i'd buy another one of these in the future."
2,Defective after few uses,"We were elated with the price but after a few uses, a bubble appeared in the enamel cooking surface which cracked. We requested a replacement and hope we do not have the same issue with it."
4,A Beginning... but some Flaws,"This book is a start to finding some excellent books written by women. And the synopses of the 500 books were well-written and quite enticing. However, some of the selections seemed arbitrary. Though the authors make no claims of being all-inclusive (which they couldn't be, anyway), it seemed too much like the books were chosen on the authors' personal opinions alone. (See Booklist's review above.)"
3,A guide.,"I disagree with the opinion that, in order to appreciate this book, you need to be female as has been asserted. In fact, if fewer people felt this way, books authored by women would probably circulate with greater force and efficiency. Now, although I found some titles listed in this book to be based more in personal preference, I do agree that many of them are, as stated, great. Not, in all cases, award-winning or critically acclaimed. But that wasn't the point of the book. I found it helpful to search for a title by using the topic index. In general, the book is helpful and can be used as a guide or a springboard. It shouldn't become a bible of women's literature."
3,A good start to a reading list,"This book does a great job bringing your attention to lesser-known works. However, I have a few problems. First, the organization (by themes, rather than title or author) makes it hard to find titles without resorting to the index. Also, it is limiting to list only one book per author, and the attempt to include diverse authors leads to the omission of such greats as Lorrie Moore. It's worth owning, but shouldn't be regarded as a last word."
5,quality work,"Thank God that someone out there cares about work by and about half the world's population! Not only is this an astonishingly extensive listing, but I have also actually taken the time to track down and read several of the suggested books, to discover, to my eternal delight, that women really do write top-quality stuff! This reference could be the starting point for a real challenge to the phallo-santified ""Canon""..."
1,"A MESSAGE TO ERICA BAUERNMEISTER, THE AUTHOR OF THIS BOOK","Erica, sorry to let you know that in the near future you will learn that one of your chosen females in 500 GREAT BOOKS BY WOMAN does not deserve to be mentioned. I refer to Jean Sasson who happens to be a hoax author. Sassons PRINCESS book you mentioned, as well as the following two books about this Princess are a con. Sassons living, breathing Saudi Arabian Prince-friend does not exist now, nor ever did exist. This princess happens to be a figment of Jean Sasson's wild imagination.Until the expose will be made public, In the meantime you might like to GOOGLE: THE PRINCESS SULTANA HOAX"
4,"Well alright, Big Bub","As a Today and a Big Bub fan, I had to buy this CD. It was a gamble that was worth taking. ""Turn the Lights On"" adds a new dimension to love songs and I will add this to my repertoire along with Teddy's ""Turn off the lights"". Big Bub's voice is awesome and a musical instrument. The crime would be for this album to go by unnoticed and not purchased, it is definitely money worth spending; music connosieurs would have deprived themselves by not purchasing and truly appreciating Big Bub's talent. The only complaint that I have is that enough information about the paricipating artists who collaborated to make this wonderful piece of art."
3,its okay! he still has it going on!,"big bub is a very good singer. but im a bit surprised that his past history with former group today was not mentioned! for future references, can you please locate the group ""today""? i know that it is out of print, but i would like some info.thanks"
5,No Rinse Shampoo,"Although I ordered the the shampoo caps, what was delivered was a case of No Rinse Shampoo. I did not return it as I was indeed of something for my bed fast mother. I am very pleased with the shampoo and am sure I would be with the caps also."
5,Better than expected,These surprised me. I use them when i can't get my mom in the shower & her hair comes out like its been washed in the shower
2,Grateful Dead Muzak,"OK, I really, really, really tried to like this. Really. I mean, these guys are gods in the world of improvisational music.But ""Jazz is Dead"" is the name of this band, and the music is just that...dead, lifeless, uninspired. It's like these guys never listened to bootlegs; they've just copied studio Dead, and you know what that is like.Flawless musicianship, great mixing and perfect engineering do not a good album make. If you like the energy of moe. or Uncle Sammy or String Cheese Incident, you'll be disappointed with this album."
4,Come on amazon...,I am a major fan of jazz is dead and everything that herring has been a part of and i was happy to buy this mp3 version of the cd. but i was pretty bummed out when i found out that Eyes of the World is actually Weather Report I. So i just bought Weather Report I twice. It'd be nice if you could fix that for future customers.
3,Unlocking the Animal Mind,"I agree with Dr. McMillan's theories as I have observed first hand much of what he says in his book. I applaud his attempt at educating people to the fact that animals do have feelings which should be acknowledged, respected, and addressed along with their physical needs. Overall, I found the book interesting reading, though it was somewhat repetitious. The stories and his encounters as a veterinarian, however, kept my interest, and I feel better informed for improving the quality of life of my pets and rescue animals. That was my intention. I do recommend the book for anyone who sincerely wants to better understand the animal world."
3,"Eh, It's ok","This book is interesting and the author makes his point that animals have feelings with science, logic and life experiance. However, I agree with others when they say that the book was repeatative. If you read the intro and ch. 4 you've you can put the book down because the other chapter's don't say anything differant."
1,Very Disappointed!,"I bought the Weldwood Contact Cement to glue a pretty perfume bottle cap and it did absolutely nothing. It did not work as the product stated and the perfume cap is made from plastic, which Weldwood Contact Cement stated it was designed for."
2,good product poor shipping,This is very good glue but it came via the post office and now that they fly all small packages the lids had been pushed up by the low air pressure and leaked on the 2 that I had purchased. I do not think there is any way around this but strapping tape over the lid might help. Try to find it locally if you can.
2,What's the Big Deal?,"Yes, it's nice to have a 28 mm lens on an auto-everything camera, but other than that, I don't really understand what the big deal (the raves of other reviewers) is with this camera. The pictures are not any sharper than with my Olympus Stylus Zoom, the exposures are not that great under many conditions, it is very difficult -- if not impossible -- to stop the zoom where you want to in the middle of its range, and -- worst of all for me -- the camera comes pre-set with a printable (wrong) date, that unless you reset or erase it will ruin all of your photos!! I stupidly took this camera on vacation without testing it first and shot eleven rolls of film with it. I sure wish I had taken my Olympus instead."
1,Overpriced and underwhelmed,"Bought this camera a few months back and retunred it after a few rolls. Indoor pics are horrible compared to my old Pentax PS, and the camera is uncomfortable to operate. Why on earth did the put a viewfinder on the edge? Don't waste your money on this camera. Go with Pentax or Olympus for PS cameras."
4,A Good Shooter,"The Kyocera / Yashica T4 Zoom is a well-made, handsome and very compact zoom film camera. The lens has above-average sharpness and photos taken with this camera show little or no vignetting, a problem typical of these cameras. The camera is very easy to use and, although its small size makes for tiny controls, it's not hard to use. Color saturation is very good and contrast isn't bad, but photos may be overall a bit dark because of the slow lens speeds. My only complaint is that, at wide-angle settings, the flash isn't very powerful, but it's acceptable at close-up range. This camera probably won't take photos that are as sharp as those taken by a single focal length camera (like the Olympus Stylus Epic with an f2.8 lens -- sharper than the original T4? Maybe!), but for a zoom camera it produces quality results."
1,This is a CHILD sized rocking chair.,"I made the mistake of thinking this was an adult sized rocking chair. The website does not make it crystal clear that this is a child sized chair. When I tried to return the chair, Baby Age and its manufacture Giftmark gave me the run around about the entire return process, who would be taking it back, etc. They are asking for a 50% restocking fee (a bit outrageous?). I would not recommend buying from this company unless you are ABSOLUTELY sure of what you are getting."
2,An unfortunate sequel to a hilarous book,"Having spent a lot of time travelling in Eastern Europe, South East Asia, and several newly liberalized, ex-communist countries, I greatly enjoyed ""Molvania"" and was looking forward to something similar with Phaic Tan. Molvania was hilarous because, though greatly exaggerated, everything (almost everything) had a grain of truth. Unfortunately the same can not be said of Phaic Tan. Whereas Molvania was witty and clever, Phaic Tan is, with few exceptions, just silly. Most of the entries are absurdities that could be made up about any place in the world. Most people who have been to the parts of the world referred to -- Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos -- will have true stories to report that are far more funny than the entries in this book."
4,Another great travel guide!,"I didn't like this one quite as much as Molvania, but it's still good humor. It may just be that some of the quirks discussed in this book are not as familiar to me as the post-Communist land of Molvania..."
4,Great,Sutton does a great job describing all the liquid rocket engines through out history. His chapters on the individual companies in the US and throughout the world are an excellent resource. I've learned a lot reading this book. Everyone interested or working in the liquid rocket engine business should buy this book.
4,All the rockets you wanted to ask about,"Whew!There is a lot to read here. Sutton is one of the father figures of rocket propulsion expositions, and when a man with his personal engagement in the development tells the story, well, there is a lot to tell. As an European I feel faintly disturbed by the parallell usage of the ancient feet-inches-pounds measurements along with the metric system, but then, concerning the developments in the US, that is a part of the scenery.The greatest drawback with a book like this, is the sheer physical weight. It makes for ""heavy reading"" in bed, although, it semms to lack a common failing with bedside books, that is, lulling the reader to sleep and then hitting his nose to re-awake him. I put Sutton down mhen my mental harddisc reach overload condition, but as eagerly, i go for more the next day.Simply a MUST for an armchair astronaut alongside the more wellknown Sutton ""Elements""."
3,Not my first choice for a long-term crate,"This crate was featured as a gold box special recently, a day after I had ordered a more expensive portable crate from Amazon. I decided to order this one as well and decide which one I would keep.This crate would probably be fine in the smaller sizes, but in the large size I ordered for my growing retriever pup, I noticed that the top sagged quite a bit which reduced the headroom. As this would be used on a nearly daily basis in my car, I decided to send this one back and keep the more expensive, sturdier crate that I had initially ordered (even though it was almost twice as expensive).For an occasional use or for smaller pets, I'm sure that this would be just fine. If you are looking for a more permanent home for your pet, keep looking!"
1,Puppy simply pushes door open.,"Our 3 month old Brit puts his paw against the door and breaks the zipper connection to get out. Took him about 1 hour to figure it out. For leaving it open it works great for traveling with it closed or if you need to temp. keep him in it, forget it."
2,"Not sturdy, have to return it","I agree with other reviewers, this item is not well made, not stable. Especially, the top part waffling, couldn't stay up nicely. I would not recommend this product to anyone. I had to return this after one day."
3,Liked the map on the book,"This book was a good introduction to Alhambra Palace in Granada, Spain. It had the map of the palace and explanation of each room and was small enough to carry in my bag. Since you won't get anything at Alhambra itself (unless you get the tour guide or audio guide), you will need some kind of reference to help you navigate around. The place is HUGE! The writing itself was bit boring and my eyes glazed over most of the book, but it is an interesting starting point if you are thinking of visiting Alhambra. How much of this palace is original? Who cares? The place is AMAZING! I highly recommend a visit to this palace if you are in Southern Spain. (If you are thinking of visiting, you need to book in advance. The tickets get sold out very, VERY, fast -- especially the daytime visits.)"
1,Don't rely on this book for research purposes!,"Page one, paragraph one has two glaring errors. First, there are indeed figurative paintings in the Alhambra. They are painted on leather decorating the ceilings of the recesses in the Hall of Kings. Second, Columbus did not present his plan to cross the Atlantic to Ferdinand and Isabella at the Alhambra but at Santa Fe, their encampment several miles outside of Granada.I didn't bother to read further. This book promised to be worthless."
4,Very helpful when visiting the sick and house bound,This book is a very helpful tool in my Ministry of the sick and home bound. It is small and easily slips into my bible for use with nursing home patients. I would reccomend for any new Minister of sick.
5,A fine score,"I agree with the other two reviews as to the singing. It's uniformly excellent. Flavio is from the same period in the 1720s as Giulio Cesare and Tamerlano, with equivalently fine music. I listened to the whole opera today on the big stereo in our home and was reminded anew of what a beautiful recording this is--it had been a long time since I last listened to it. The acoustic is natural and moderately reverberant, sort of what you would hear in an acoustically good theater without an audience. I often feel that many recent historically informed baroque recordings suffer from excessive speed for speed's sake and ugly sounds from the strings. Jacobs gets beautiful sounds from his baroque band. Don't me wrong, a few fast arias are really fast and dramatic as they should be, but Jacobs doesn't make a fetish of speed.I have not heard other recordings of Flavio but can recommend this one wholeheartedly. If you like Handel and baroque opera, you should very much enjoy this."
3,Good quality prep bowls but hard to read the inside measure.,"Bought these for my mom for Christmas, and they're really good quality. Each bowl has a full and a 1/2 measure marked on the inside of the bowl - unfortunately (and this may just be the chocolate color) the 1/2 measure line is difficult to see.Still like them for their quality, but mainly just use them at the full level, or measure things into them."
5,I'd buy it again,"Product is perfect when you're busy at work and want to grab a serving of nuts out of a larger bag or container, or if you want to measure out the right amount of yogurt quickly and get back to work. They are nice enough looking that you can use them as bowls and eat right out of them, as I do with my yogurt, nut and peanut butter snacks."
4,positivley informative,Methadone is obviously the most succesfull form of treatment available today hopefully this book will shed some light on a subject that many people do not understand that being adiction relapse and recovery.
5,Another Great Book by a Great Author,"This is the third book I've read by Mark Hitchcock and as usual, it's a great book. The author has a gift of being able to explain the details in a short, consise way. Excellent reading for those who don't want a lot of details but want a clear explanation."
1,typical fare from this one-trick pony,"I've always thought that a well-versed Bible scholar and minister should be able to speak on a number of topics, but Rev. Hitchcock sticks to the same old stock formula that made his other books sell. One-dimensional and appealing to literal-minded Christians only, this entry into the Signs of the Times series will simply make the anxious reader even more anxious about today's world. Are we living in troubled times? Definitely. Is it the end of the world? Nobody can truly say.(If it WERE, these authors would give these books away free, as there would be no reason or opportunity to use money during the Second Coming.) For real answers about end times, find a level-headed minister in your own community and save your money."
1,Contains PGPR,Hershey's chocolate contains PGPR (Polyglycerol Polyricinoleate) which is derived from castor beans. The chemical weapon ricin is made from castor beans too. I'd rather eat real chocolate!
5,"Amazing Value, Great Taste","I don't always eat candy, but when I do, I eat Kit Kat. These have always been my favorite candy bar and this value is just superb. I can't resist buying a couple of these a year (especially around Halloween) and delving into them!! Depending on what seller you buy from, they might taste not as 'fresh', so read the sellers feedback."
3,can't take-along very far,"this castle is not intended for younger kids, it doesn't stay together at hinges very well. overall child had fun playing with it."
2,Not at all sturdy,"We bought this castle last year for our four-year old's ""Santa"" gift. After carefully assembling and only a few short minutes of play, it completely fell apart. My son was entertained very briefly trying to rebuild the castle, but quickly lost interest as the corners came apart, and chains holding the drawbridge broke over and over. This year he's asked Santa for another Castle - ""one made of wood that the elves did a better job with!"""
5,WOW!!!!,These are 2 of my all time favorite movies. Now I have them both in one case. How great is that. A must buy. 2 Thumbs up.
4,These movies bring back memories...,"Can't Hardly Wait and The New Guy were geared for teenagers whenever I was in high school. They take me back to my high school days, and that's the main reason I purchased them. They're definitely fun to watch, and it's also fun to watch actors when they were young and still learning :)"
2,Poor quality,"Worked well for 3 months. Then fell apart. The steel part that goes into your USB drive fell off. Poor quality. I believe Kingston is a tier-2 company in terms of quality, hence the low price."
1,Reached Capacity after 24 MB,"Everything has been working fine until six months and 24mb storage bites later, my Kingston 512MB DataTraveler says it's full every time I try to store Word documents. Mind you, it says I have 488 MB remaining so you can imagine how frustrating this experience is. I'll have to buy another flash drive, maybe a SanDisk.Update: I subsequently bought a 512MB PNY Attache flash drive and it got overloaded at the same point so apparently the capacity ""512"" doesn't match up with my iMac's definition."
3,"Seems to be working, Pills are too big.","I've used Pycnolgenol products before. The Linus Pauling brand that stopped being sold -- unfortunately.This is the closet formula I could find to the Linus Pauling brand.I've used this product now for about 3 weeks and it seems to have brought back the mental focus and recall that I was getting with the Linus Pauling brand.The only downside is the pills are way to BIG!! I wish they were smaller.I had to get a pill crusher that splits them into fours and then I crush them, and swallow them down with orange juice. This is really inconvenient , but this is what I'm stuck with so far. If I can find a formula that is right with smaller pills I'll switch."
4,source natural pycnogenol complex tablets,"I liked the product, but like to know where the pycnogenol are manufactured. In the first batch many were broken.Source Natural pycnogenol complex"
3,pycnogenol,"Won't be re-ordering. Don't see any results using this product and with prices going up on everything else, I'll be saving my money by not ordering again."
2,hard for me to take,"Kind of hard to take, my stomach sucks. I need to get capsules not tablets next time. These will last a long time cause hard for me to take."
2,good coffee....few bugs,The beans have a tendancy to hang up in the hopper and I constantly have to open the hopper and manually push the beans down the hole. For the money this thing cost...a major inconvienence!
1,Long term reliability issues,"Unfortunately, like a 1970's Alpha Romeo, good looks and great performance don't add up to a hill of (coffee) beans over the long run when reliability is taken into account.My first machine was dead on arrival with the fateful ""Ventilate"" issues seen by other purchasers. The second machine, which although shipped and sold by Amazon was manufactured 18 months prior to my purchase (Jan 2007). This started to give trouble after about 14 months with the boiler leaking steam and flooding the counter-top which, given the claims of a stainless steal ""durable"" boiler was risible. This, coupled with the fact that the brewunit has jammed three times (requiring a trip to the local repair shop) means that 18 months in to the purchase I've spent over $650 in maintenance fees. For 2-3 cups of coffee per day, a trip to Starbucks begins to look cheap!"
3,Jack,The content is good... Book is very over priced... It is a simple compilation pasted into a document from the writings of Ellen G. White.
4,"The Ripper of Storyville, Edward D Hoch","This book contains 14 short stories originally written for mystery magazines about gunfighter/detective, Ben Snow, who is continually mistaken for the late Billy the Kid. Each story has a mysterious twist and is usually set in a historical background. Some stories approach being great ""impossible"" mysteries, but end disappointingly. Others are simply good short mysteries."
3,immortal spoof,"If you are an avid fan of Trigun(TM) you will find this manga series so simmilar it isnt funny, although the author of this manga tries to be creative it still reads pretty similar to the manga Trigun(TM) and Trigun Maximum (TM)"
4,Art vs. story,"Immortal Rain is definitely worth checking out. I can't say much for the story and dialogue - they're a patchwork of cliches you'll undoubtedly recognize from other mangas and animes. But the artwork is BEAUTIFUL. I keep buying them just for that. Even old people, people without ideal body types, are somehow beautiful in these books. And the emotions come through so subtly and with such poignancy.... At least pick it up and look at it in the store. You'll be impressed."
4,Not bad for my first manga book,"As it was my first manga book, I have nothing to compare it to. But overall, it was an extremely good read. It has the perfect combination of humor, fantasy, and action. It's confusing to read at first with unannounced flashbacks every so often but it gets easier to read. After this one I will definitely be reading more."
5,Great book to read,I am in Iraq and recieving packages usually takes slow but I was surprised this novel came in so soon. Great shipping speed and at a reasonable price.I just like to say Immortal Rain was a good read. I'm not a huge manga fan but I do like the occasional novel and Immortal Rain was just plan and simple awesome. It takes an interesting view on immortality and I plan on finishing the series as I can.
5,Like this sweetener,"I have replaced all sugars with this and I love it. It's most like maple sirup but less harsh. I would like to have a large tub type container instead of these little bottles since they do tend to leak during shipping and I use quite a bit of it. I don't bake a lot but in Soymilk, cereal and pancakes this is excellent! And it makes the best chocolate soymilk!"
4,Raw Blue Agave,This is an exceptional sweetener. It sweetens and does not interfere with the taste of the food. It is concentrated and can be used in hot teas and coffees and when cooking food. I have used it to make pies and cobblers. The only problem is that it is expensive!
4,Good agave,This product was a little thinner than the last brand I bought but the overall flavor is nice.
5,Great product,"This is quality agave nectar with a wonderful taste. Buying it through Amazon saves us money as the individual bottles are much more expensive at the grocery or health food store. With my husband being diabetic and me being hypoglycemic, I am thankful to have found the agave for tea, hot or cold cereal, and baking desserts since it keeps our blood sugar stabalized."
3,Better value elsewhere,"The old saying buyer beware comes to mind as i review this product. while the sweetner itself is a good product, it does not represent the best value for the money. Pay attention to the miniscule contents of each bottle (11.75oz) which when you do the math, its a lot cheaper to buy the Domino 23.5oz at Wal Mart for $6.99 ($5.99 with the $1 coupon on the Domino Web page.) I would not recommend at the price."
4,"Classic Nissan, typical keychain","Nothing special about this key chain other than the fact that the logo piece is hooked to the key chain with metal, so it won't wear out with wear. Otherwise, a typical key chain."
2,not for me,"I work in an accounting office and at age 66 it is sometimes difficult to keep my focus. I had hoped this would help, but for me, didn't do much. Back to the drawing board."
3,Current Enada NADH is Not the Same as One Made by Vitamin Shoppe Years Ago,"No matter what company makes Enada NADH now, there is only a little boost of energy when I take two 5mg pills. When Vitamin Shoppe actually made Enada NADH it was a REAL boost of energy. About 10 years ago for some reason, VS stopped making this and I haven't been able to find any that compare. I wonder if our fine FDA has anything to do with this (?).This is definitely better than nothing and does give a little boost of energy."
2,"not very strong, not as thorough as my Park was","Five minutes out of the box and it's broken.A spring in the upper part pushes down into the lower part. This causes assembly to slip while I'm closing the locking mechanism. Very little force applied...and an important piece of plastic shears off. Now I can't lock it closed, but need to hold it together with one hand.Doesn't seem to clean the sides of chain as well as my Park did, but maybe that is because this chain was really dirty. Does better job cleaning the pins than my Park did.The red hinge is supposed to sit on derailleur, so you don't have to hold the box. This doesn't work too well with an Ultegra derailleur; red part falls off, box opens, fluid spills.Doubt I'll be using this a second time...disassembling a chain for overnight soak is so much easier and more thorough."
1,A waste of time and money,"I commute about 40 miles weekly, so I thought this would be a great way to keep my chain clean. It's not. The construction is flimsy and cheap. It didn't seem to work very well at all. My chain remained filthy even after running it through the chain machine. The whole contraption then fell apart and spilled degreaser all over the place. You'd be better off to get an old tooth brush and a bottle of spray degreaser and scrub your chain that way. The brush included with this kit would be good for that, except that the bristles get stuck in the gears and pull out of the brush. The lube is good, but you can buy that seperately -- do it. Don't waste your $ on the whole kit."
1,Broken Already,"Upon the first use of this device I had trouble keeping the top part attached to the bottom. When I looked closely at the top portion I noticed that one of the plastic locking pins had broken off, along with a small portion of the plastic case. I have not found the pin that broke off, so it might have been broken at the factory. I certainly did not over stress the device. Also, some of the degreasing fluid had leaked into the package even though the bottle was ""sealed."" Whether it broke during shipping, at the factory, or while I used it, the plastic used in this device seems not to be strong enough for the task. It did an O.K. job of cleaning the chain, but I had to hold the top to keep it closed due to the broken pin. If the plastic case was ""beefed up"" a bit it might be worth the $38 I paid. As it is, I am disappointed."
4,"DVD-""Old Time"" Movie-BEau Geste","Many ""moons"" ago I saw this in college and loved it. So finally, I bought it some 30 years later. Still great movie with Gary Cooper."
5,Classic with something for everyone,"The really is the ""classic"" movie of all time. It shows more love and torment than any other movie I have every seen.Unconditional love...It shows if pushed you would steal to support your family....you would take the blame for things you believe people you love did to save them....you would risk your life to safe your familyOn the flip side, you are shown.....jealousy, greed, crueltyA Movie with Love, Mystery, Comedy, and Adventure.....what could top it!This is the one movie I can't wait for on DVD!!!!!!!!!!"
3,NOT COLOR,"The description says:Format: Color, Dolby, DVD, Full Screen, NTSC, Original recording remastered, Silent, Subtitlednote, this is not a colorized movie - its just black and white!"
2,Old classic boy story,"The basic story is well compiled and it forms a classic boy story. It has a nice plot and it is a bit tragic but also portraits manly virtues as they were understood 50 or 100 years ago.The film follows the book very well, but cannot make it a living story. The only thing that rescues the film is that the original story was so good. What upsets me the most is that the bad guys does not seem very bad and the good guys are too good.But it is a classic story."
1,Beau Geste,"The item advertised was for a colour DVD version of Beau Geste, however due to either a packing error or error in advertising a black and white version was supplied. As I already have a B&W copy I would not have ordered another. I'm very disappointed in having wasted my money and will be reluctant to rely on details advertised in future. Geoff"
4,A Serious Drama!,"First of all I would like to say that this movie is not funny or meant to be funny as one customer stated in their review. I don't want viewers to get confused and miss out on a serious drama portrayed quite well by Glover and Goldberg. I have seen this movie a few times, and I myself never even thought about the roles they played in The Color Purple, which incidently was also a serious drama. For anyone to think otherwise, they simply have a closed mind, and really missed the point. This is a ""must see"". A story that is very common, because so many people ""Forget where they came from."""
3,Actually 3 1/2,"I agree this was not a comedy. The story of the black man that makes it far enough to where he is suspicious of other blacks living on his block was interesting. He actually set a house on fire so a black neighbor wouldn't buy it. I really enjoyed the curious white women also. The grocery store scenes were also quite interesting.Towards the end when Glovers daughter had the blond hair and the contacts, I was saying damn, look how far things have gone. Wonder what daddy would have thought. As for the end, I wonder, did Mable ever tell Ruth what happened with the house. I liked the movie but have seen better ones with a similar plot."
1,So Sorry...,"Yes, I'm afraid I can't agree with any of the reviews above, except that they are all right in saying that this movie certainly is not at all funny. (The only funny thing, in fact, is Whoopi Goldberg's absurd glasses.) This movie is a real snore. It doesn't start anywhere, and it doesn't go anywhere. It's too long and it pieces together all kinds of different scenes without any kind of rationale. The idea of the cost of upward mobility is interesting, but the execution is flawed, and I can understand why more people haven't heard of this movie."
3,Extraordinary beginning but loses steam...,"I'd enjoyed Dancing Bear and after about 50-75 pages of Mexican Tree Duck was ready to annoint Crumley the most audacious talent on the crime-writing scene. The early chapters introduce a cast of characters so promising that it only makes my disappointment with the rest of the book that much more keen. Essentially, the story dissipates into an uninvolving and sometimes confusing tale of drugs, guns, and money."
1,Who would think Crumley was any good?,"I absolutely loved two of Crumley's works: The Last Good Kiss and Dancing Bear.Something went wrong on this outing. Shugrue lost his personality (he had lots of depth in The Last Good Kiss), the plot grew Byzantine, the villians were cartoonish and way over the top, as was the climax.Bordersnakes is a little better. Skip this book!"
1,An Awful Book,"I hate to say this, but I had a hard time with this Crumley book -- too much coke, too many Vietnam references, and too many undeveloped characters to be as solid as ""The Last Good Kiss."""
4,Helps with last minute breakouts,This product does help with last minute breakouts in combination with the face wash...great product will definitely purchase this product again.
5,Great Product - Not Overly Harsh,"This is a great product for minor blemish flare-ups, especially because it is not overly harsh or drying. It works quickly and I recommend it. Shipment was prompt."
5,Loved this movie as a kid!,"I was so happy to see this was on DVD now. My husband bought it for me for Christmas and we watched it right away. Still as good as I remember, basic early 90's movie :)"
3,New Transfer,"This is a new, widescreen, official studio release of the movie. But the reviews here go back a few years. Keep that in mind when you read negative reviews about the quality of the transfer of this film to DVD. Those reviews are NOT for this newly released DVD, so they can be safely ignored.I gave this only 3 stars for the quality of the film itself, not for the quality of the DVD. The movie is OK for its target audience, and while it has positive qualities, it isn't a great film."
2,Not as pictured,I was hoping for the special edition item as pictured and it was not. Not worth the time and expense to return.
5,fun,I am glad I found this film on DVD because it was a walk down memory lane. I would recommend this film to anyone who enjoys family adventure films.
3,Best for monarch butterfly fans,"While this is an interesting book about the migration of monarch butterflies, it's a little dry for those of us who are just curious. Author intrudes self into story at some points."
3,Boring for non-devotees,"I suppose if you are extremely interested in monarch butterflies you will find this book fascinating. I must admit I read only 100 pages. I enjoyed the beginning, when Halpern traveled to Mexico, but after page 100 the book was too academic, filled with the points of view of various monarch afficionados. Pretty dull stuff. I didn't think the writing was all that great, either. I suppose it was an academic success, but it didn't draw me in to the adventure."
1,Caught in the Mystery of Why Anyone Should Care,"I had read this book for school, and by the first page I knew it was going to be a painful experience. The first fifty pages weren't so bad, after that, everything went downhill. I was never less interested in butterflies in my life. At first, the topic of the story was clear- going to a convention in Mexico about saving the monarchs. After that, nothing made sense- the storyline no longer had any real point. The author jumped around from date to date in no particular order. At one point, I wasn't sure if continuing the book would get me any further than I was before I strarted. Unless you have an extreme love of monarch butterflies and being extremely bored and confused, do not buy this book."
3,It's O SCALE,"This is more of an FYI. I know, you need to read everything before you buy. I did not and it is in the description of this product. But, be careful - I searched for HO scale airports and this one came up. It is an O scale. I think probably everything else about it is great. Came on time, parts look complete but wrong size."
5,Precision Work,"I have needed very small metal files (mini rasps) in a variety of shapes for precison work on jewelery and I purchased the Commando Precision File. It has made my work so much better and easier. For greater control, I use the files without the handle, but the handle and chuck work very well. I like having all the files together in a small container. You will too."
1,Tip broke off on plastic!,The file tip snapped off while filing a plastic doll's nose hole! The file is new and it was the first time I used that specific tip. Thankfully I can still return for a refund. What a disappointment to receive trash. Now I have to ship back and wait for a refund. :-(
1,"Don't buy this sound card, a waste of money","Can't adjust Treble or Bass, way worse than the sound blaster 16 that I had 10 years ago. Even worse than onboard audio! Not even worth 1 star but that's the only option."
1,Amazon's price is too high,"My one-star rating is for Amazon's pricing of this item. As of this writing, Amazon's price is $36.99 and the ""list price"" is $49.99. According to Fujifilm, however, the list price is $19.99.I questioned Amazon's customer service about the price. Amazon's response did not address the fact that Amazon's price is higher than the manufacturer's list price. This quote summarizes the message I received: ""I am sorry to inform you that we cannot be responsible for prices posted without our permission on other web sites."""
3,Where's the leather?,"I expected a leather case instead its a nylon or polyester material with synthetic leather coping,very disappointing for the price"
4,provides in-depth understanding of body systems and effects.,"This book is simple for the layman to understand. Provides good detail into how the body reacts to wounds, infection, loss of blood etc. Educates the reader to understand the body systems which makes proper treatment understandable and predictable. No more trying to memorize what to do for this injury or that."
3,Good information but dated,This is a good resource for someone just beginning in learning about systems theory and interventions for the price. This book can be purchased new for much cheaper than modern textbooks and used for cheaper than most books in general. The information is a good beginning resource as long as the reader understands some of the concepts and perspectives are dated and have changed over time.
4,Excellent Book,"This book builds upon much of Richo's earlier work, and is a helpful tool in navigating life's problems."
3,Why so negative? Here's the flipside!,"How about believing the same things - but from a POSITIVE perspective instead??? See below!1. Every ending is really just a the start of a new beginning.2. Sometimes things take an unexpected turn for the better!3. Life is sometimes fair...sometimes confusing!4. Pain is a part of life, but only one part of life.5. Most people are loving and loyal most of the time.He really should have titled this book - 5 negative thing that will prove why accepting the negative does not bring positive change or happiness. A simple book - a mistaken perspective.Should be re-titled as 5 things about life that are sometimes good things and sometimes disappointing.But isn't that what LIFE is?"
1,Just List The Five Things,"This book was such a gigantic waste of time. He lists the Five Things in the first few pages--that was enough right there. Boom, over--these are the five things. Period. He then went on and spun the ""Things"" into such a mush of self-help blather that I just went to sleep. It was repetitive and boring. A four-year-old would have been more enlightening. This book was a deadly snooze. Blah."
3,Not what I was hoping for,"I bought this book because it has a great premise: There are 5 things you cannot change and you have to learn to accept them as they are and live with them. The five things are: 1. Everything ends and changes, 2. Things do not always go as planned, 3. Life is not always fair, 4. Pain is part of life and 5. People are not loving and loyal all the time. I wanted to learn more about the psychology behind dealing with these issues. Unfortunately, the psychological aspects are glanced over and the main thrust behind the book is gaining mindfulness through a religion of your choice. I have no problem with that point of view, it's just not what I was expecting when I bought the book."
4,Good!,"This is a good book, carefully researched and relevant to many spheres of everyday life. I found it very valuable."
4,A god choice,Good recording. In fine condition. Enjoying this pice. My nephew sang this with his school choir and I didn't get to hear him. This was a nice alternative.
2,Useless without the extension arm,Purchased the suction cup mount for my car and it is useless without the extension arm that this one does not have. The photos showed the product with the arm and it is not included.
3,This Mount NEEDS extention Arm!!!!,"I try to keep these things short and sweet.Positives:Mount is durable sticks to the car glass like glue.I was only able to use the mount out side of the car and at 40 miles p/hr no issues and pretty good video.Negatives:I purchased this mount for inside the car and with out the extention arm, I cannot use the mount with any of my cameras. (I have 3 different cameras and tried it in 2 cars)Called Panavise and I was told to buy the extention arm total cost with shipping $17.00 almost what I paid for the mount it self. I can't help but feel ripped off.Please be aware when buying you def. need the extention arm for this mount to be funtionable inside the car. I would give it 5 stars if I was actually able to mount it inside my car.(Waiting Patiently for the Extention Arm)"
2,Does not work with Flip video,"This mount does not work with a Flip video on the windshield. The angle of the windshield is such that the arm is too short and the top of the flip video hits the windshield so that it is angled up.It would work on the back window of a pickup. The image quality when mounted on a back window is good if the arm is vertical. It is very poor with A LOT of vibration if it is mounted with the arm horizontal.Perhaps another type of camera would work, but do not get this if you are using a flip video on the windshield"
5,Great value,I ordered 2 of these for taking videos when I race (New England Hillclimb Association). I use one on my windshield and the other I will put outside the car with a tether. I have found that if you attach it correctly and mount it to stable surfaces the video quality is usually good. I would buy these again.
3,Difficult to attach suction cup properly and lever is flimsy,"This was attractively priced. Unfortunately, I think the design is not the best compared to other brands. To properly attach the suction cup securely, you have to push the round portion in the middle firmly (hard) and then flip a lever attached to the suction cup. The lever feels very flimsy, however, and it flexes considerably as it is being flipped to the hold position. In my previous review, I had not figured out how to work this so it didn't hold very well."
2,Buy the Delkin Devices DDMOUNT-SUCTION Fat Gecko Double Knuckle Dual Suction Cup Camera Mount instead.,This mount is not of great use for anything more than a small surveillance camera. Buy the Delkin Devices DDMOUNT-SUCTION Fat Gecko Double Knuckle Dual Suction Cup Camera Mount instead if you are looking to mount a video camera.
4,"Great, but didn't have extended arm","As you probably have read in other reviews, you are hit or miss in terms of the necessary extension to use bottom mount cameras on your windshield with this thing. I had a race event coming up so I shotgunned and ordered this mount overnight from Amazon. Mine unfortunately did NOT come with the extension. I ended up mounting it on my side window as opposed to windshield (or rear hatch glass). Other than the lack of the extension, this thing is a stud. Very little vibration and no noise are transmitted through this mount. It functioned flawlessly for me and stuck to EVERY surface. Mine was exposed to intense (INTENSE) heat and strong acceleration but didn't budge the whole day. I didn't move or re-secure it once. I got more than I expected from this mount. I'm very happy."
5,Great mount,"This is really a great mount. It's VERY secure. I use it to mount a digital camera to record my autocross races, and it holds with no problem -- even with the quick starts, turns, and stops. It seems the extension arm mentioned in some of the other reviews is hit or miss though, as mine didn't come with it. It would have been helpful, but I'm not going to complain about not getting something extra for free."
5,Panavise 809 CCTV Camera Window Mount,I found that the window mount worked pefectly. I used it to take video pictures of an airplane cockpit instrument panel and front seat pilots. The camera was mounted on a side window.
2,could be better,Too shaky to be used with a camera. I bought real suction cup mounts that are 1 piece and have no give at all.
1,Useless as it comes from Amazon,"I bought this for mounting my Kodak Zi6 video camera, however it's pretty much useless as is. The slope of the windshield prevents the camera from being mounted upright. I have to hang the camera upside down and then rotate the video in editing software, which causes it to look like I'm driving on the left side of the road (the wrong side here in the U.S.). I have a Ford Edge, which would have a pretty standard windshield slope I'd think. Apparently there's an extension arm that is needed, but it's not included with the mount and there's no mention of this from Amazon.If you have a camera with a connector on the top, then this might be ok, but if you're planning on mounting a standard handheld camera, which normally would connect on the bottom, then you're out of luck.The product is well made, but the issue of needing an extension arm for many cameras is irritating (especially since I couldn't even find the extension on the Panavise website)."
4,Great product once you have the extension,"This mount is really solid, it will hold to a windshield very well. The only problem, the reason I gave it 4 stars, is that it can't be used with a camcorder like the Kodak Zi6 without the extension. You won't find the extension on amazon or on Panavise's website. You have to call customer service 1-800-759-7535 and they will send you one completely free of charge. They told me that they have plans to include the extension with the product so if you didn't get it, just give them a call."
3,DCR-HC96 Wont fit.. nice product though..well made,"well made but the smaller camcorders dont have enough height to ""see/view"" over the suction mount.."
3,Try Pedco Clamp,"My friend told me to go with the Pedco Clamp for use in my car . He said to mount it to the visor with my camera upside down(yes , you'll have to reverse the images on your computer)but this should dampen out the heavy vibrations that is a common complaint with windshield mounts. I'll let you know how it works after my 1st months trial period ."
1,Where is it made?,"This does work for what I bought it for but my problem with it is that the box clearly states ""Made In The USA Sold Worldwide"", but on the bottom of the suction cup it says ""Made In China"". I try to buy products made in the USA and I don't mind paying more for them, but when the box says made in the USA and the item has made in china on it something is wrong."
5,Panavise Camera Mount,"For your money, the Panavise Suction-Cup Window Mount is the best you can buy. The mount has a tremendous hold on the windshield. It rotates to most any position desired. And there is very little vibration and movement of the camera once it is attached to the mount. Quality merchandise and a good buy."
2,Arm to short for windshield,"The device is nice but the swivel arm is to short to put and video camera on it and still aim through the windshield. If you plan to use it elsewhere, it will work fine. I was very disappointed but after a little creativity and a trip to Home Depot, I got it to work by mounting a tile on the dash and the mount on the tile."
3,Needs to attach from the top,"This product serves its purpose but not for the standard camcorder user. This is designed to attach to a recording device from the top of the device and not the bottom. No matter how I twisted and turned this device it was unusable.However, the parts are interchangeable with the Sunpak ClampPod Pro Clamping Tripod.[...]The two resulted in some very use-able configuations for both dash and window mounting of a standard camcorder."
4,"Not perfect, but good enough","Despite tightening the thumb wheel after attaching my small camera to the mounting screw, the camera will still swivel around the screw. The suction cup works well and overall quality is very good, but I am concerned with the longevity of the rivet on the suction cup puller lever."
4,"Good product, but.....","This is a very well engineered product but I thought it would work with any camcorder or camera that has a tripod mount hole. Wrong. It will only work with cameras that have the threaded hole on the top of the camera. Most cameras/camcorders I have seen have the hole on the bottom. In desparation, I mounted my camera upside down, and found software to rotate the captured videos to right side up. I noticed later that the feature description states that the mount is for CCTV cameras. All that said, I used the mount for my camera mounted in my car's windshield when I did laps at a racetrack and it worked perfectly. Except that I had to purchase QuickTime Pro software in order to view the video right side up."
3,Good quality but has limitations...,"Purchased 2 of these to mount security cameras. Suction cup holds really well and mount itself is of above-average quality. Only objection is that which other purchasers noted was the shortness of the ""extension arm"" - it's too short for most use. Others commented that they contacted Panavise and recieved a free extension arm but that freebee is no more. Plan on laying out another $18-$20 bucks to include shipping, which is what Panavise is charging for the 3"" extension arm (which you'll probably need). That said, I have to deduct 2 stars for value. By the time you're done, you're probably paying 2x that which Amazon sells the unit itself for. If you can get by without the extension arm, you'll be fine and very happy with this mount."
2,the arm is too short for car's front window screen!!,"I'm a petrol-head, and I like to record my driving, so I have purchesed this to record my-self driving, and once I recieved it I discovered that it does not work on new model cars, because all new cars have a very slope front window screen, so when you wanna put it on the front window you will not have any room for the camera unless you have the extension arm or put the camera up-side-down (which means you need an editing software to rotate the video), other than that it works fine.but if the main reason you will buy this product to fix on a car's front window screen get the extension arm or get one with a longer arm, you can actually see in the product pictures that all the pictures of front window mount have the extension arm."
4,Works just fine.,I used this to mount a video camera to my motorcycle helmet. If you are going to do the same I suggest you use a lanyard incase the suction cup comes loose. I am pleased with the quality of the mount and how well the suction cup stays in place while baring the weight of my camera.
3,Needs extension arm,Works very well except it needs an extension arm. I've tried several camcorders and point and shoot cameras in my car with this mount. Both have to be inverted because the sloping windshield blocks them from being mounted upright. Vibration only became a problem only when using a heavy camcorder.
1,Product not as pictured,"The product received it not as pictured. The arm is not telescopic. Meaning if you attach this to your windshield, your camcorder will not fit to video the view ahead. Also it would not adhere to the windshield."
5,"Awesome, same thing as the Sony one for the Action Cam but cheaper",10$ cheaper than the Sony equivalent re-brand and works solid.Has withheld 100+ MPH wind with no problems.Would recommend!
4,Great Product,"For the Price you cant beat this mount. Would like to have the 3"" extension but works great. Suction cup sticks to any hard surface. I need it for a Television show that I produce and it works great. Thanks! Will tape a video review this month with Item in use."
5,Don't kill 'em all !!,"We have snakes. Lots of them. But rather than ""kill 'em all and let God sort 'em out"", as my husband prefers, I take this book with me during ourdoor activities and literally look up the snake I'm looking at. The photos are extremely helpful, limited only by my own perceptual problems---for example, Texas brown snakes look like rat snakes look like copperheads to me, even in the pictures. But the majority of the snakes in Texas and in the book do NOT deserve to die...life imprisonment, maybe...this is a very comforting book to own."
5,A Field Guide to Texas Snakes,"The book is very detailed, the graphics are true to life in color. Even the enviroment where the reptiles were photographed is common to their habitit. The procedure for identification is darn near fool proof if followed carefully.I do feel that the price was very high through the dealer that sent it The price on the bar code is $21.95 I paid $60.00 something. If you need it get it, worth it suggest you shop around. Don H. Eustace Texas"
3,"Works fine, no instructions","There's not much to say about a battery charger. It charges batteries, and this one does its job just fine. The only problem is that it came without any instruction manual to explain what the different colored lights mean."
4,JVC AA-VF8,The unit light comes on green. If I put a battery in the light stays green. I know the battery is discharged. When I put it in my JVC camera the battery indicator is in the red. If I leave the battery in overnight and put it back on the camera there is no change on the battery level indicator. It still needs charging. Is there a reset that I'm missing? Is my charger defective?Update 2012-10-09:I found the problem with the charger.The wire contacts were not elevated enough to contact the battery. I hooked a fine tweezer under each wire and lifted it slightly. Now the wires make contact with the battery contacts and the charger works fine.
1,Stay away of Dollar store quality product,"Out of the box this charger did not work. The charger metallic conectors +, -, C and T totally dissapeared inside the charger case upon attaching the battery. This item is misleading buyers by carrying the JVC name; there is no quality in this product. I have read others review before placing my order ... but what I got is a crappy item like you find in Dollar stores. I am 10 years customer of amazon.com and this is my first mistake. I was ripped off by $58.31. I totally regret buying this. Cannot recommend even to my enemies."
5,Best Purchase,"Go for it,Its the best you will get for an expensive investment. Otherwise you will constantly need your camcorder to charge the battery & reduce the life of camcorder"
1,Horrible!!,"I have been a Mcafee user for the past five years. Decided to purchase this product based on past experience. Once I installed it, the problems began. Email took at least 10 min. to open up and my computer's performance became nonexistant. Uninstalled it and everything was normal again. Reinstalled it - same problems. Decided to go to McAfee's website to see if there was a patch or something. Nothing at first and then went further into the online forums. Then I realized that myself and about 5,000 other people are having this same problem right now. Check it out for yourself. Trust me - there's better ways to waste 50 bucks."
3,McAfee Total Protection 2007,Total protection is to tight for an average family. It became very frustrating and required us to turn off many of the items.
1,Uninstallable: Absymal Tech Support - $3 per minute phone support,"I purchased Mcafee Total Protection last week and after five hours of ""live"" chat tech support(two minutes minumum between responses), I was still unable to get this software to install. First they blamed it on an earlier version of Mcafee, then it was a CA etrust virus program, then it was my earlier version of Mcafee again. They have no clue. Even worse, phone-in tech support costs $3 per minute!!! I was then refered to email tech support, but they won't answer my emails. This product was free after rebates, but I still had to return it. I felt like they should pay me after the headaches this cost me."
2,Privacy Service & Spamkiller Installation Disables All Browsers & Email Programs for accessing the internet.,"Warning: I Installed Mcafee Total Protection 2007 on my Windows XP Pro Edition SP2 PC. I then was unable to connect to the internet. It disabled all my browsers (IE, Netscape, & Secure IE) & also disabled MS Outlook from accessing the internet.When I uninstalled McAfee Spamkiller and McAfee Privacy Service, I again had internet access.When I Installed Either Component after that I lost my internet connection again.I spent hours with McAfee support online free tech support but haven't been able to use these 2 components yet.Good luck if you buy this product."
1,"DON'T BUY, Save your $$","Their software came with my Dell computer. I wasn't happy with the service. Now every year at this time they charge my credit card. Their customer support is TERRIBLE, I've had to call in multiple times each year to get them to refund my money (each call was about 20-30mins), and they continue to bill me. I haven't figured out a way to get my credit # out of their system to avoid these charges in the future.VERY FRUSTRATING. I am livid that I have spent so much time on this, and that they contiue to bill me. I think their poor service is by design so that it's more painful to go through the work of a refund than just accepting the charges for a product I haven't used in 3yrs."
1,doesn't support all of vista,"On their box it says that to download the vista installer, visit this link. You go there and download and it doesn't support any 64 bit version of vista. Buyer beware, they aren't telling you the full systems supported. If you contact their customer service, they'll say, it's coming soon. The boxes with the stickers were printed in April, so soon to them means months at least 4+ months away. horrible service. i'm going to get their competitor's software."
1,Huge delays in opening Microsoft Applications,"After I installed McAfee Total Protection 2007, it took more than 20 minutes to open every Word document or Excel spreadsheet or Powerpoint slide. This was very much frustrating. McAfee Total Protection 2007 slows down other applications and I have uninstalled this product finally."
2,Warning on Update Service,"The anti-virus product came with my Dell. I signed up for the updates that are needed for the virus scan to work. It seemed to work fine. But after a while, I was tired of the pop up's telling me that I should upgrade to another product.I deleted this program from my computer. But I am still being charged 39.95/year for the automatic subscription service. Last month I spent about half an hour finding the correct number and calling customer service. But today I received another e-mail today informing me that I would be charged again. I just do not have time to deal with this issue every month.Like AOL they might have a great product, but their marketing efforts will eventually make you sorry you bought it."
2,Calling all worthy sea dawgs!,This was a fabulously written and very imformative book. Very rarely do you see books of this nature. So much imformation! Historically accurate portrayal of privateers. Fabulous! This book is truly sea-worthy! A must have.
5,I Love T-Boz,"I've been a fan of TLC since I was small, I never read this book until just now and I'm 20. I'm a poet/writer myself, and although the poems aren't that great, but I think the construction of the book is very creative and I feel it puts us a little deeper into her life, which is great for any fan. The essay section is probably one of the best parts about this book. Overall, as a dedicated fan, I think it was well worth the amount I paid. T-Boz is my favorite member of TLC, and it's nice to feel more close to one of my favorite musicians, and it also influenced me to work on my own personal book, which I've been thinking about for years. I think this was a good buy, and anyone who is a TLC fan should get it."
5,Thoughts by Tionne Watkins,i highly reccomend this book of poetry and gave it the highest ranking.it was clear and honest. i identified with a lot of what she said especially about being sick and was very touched by the essays she wrote. i think it was wonderful that she let you get to know a little about her . also being a huge tlc fan i've always wanted an opportunity to get some insight on any of them.
4,Great book!,"I thought that for the most part, the poetry was really good. Some of the poems I didn't care for, but I like T-Boz and I always have. I think that it's great for her to want to give back to her fans her own personal thoughts. It 's amazing to think that even with all the money and the fame she still has lots of problems to overcome, just like us average people do."
1,Awful!,"I don't understand how anyone could possibly think that this book is a meaningful collection of poetry. In short, it is garbage. It consists of the mose illiterate, saccharine, poorly crafted poetry I have ever seen. What angers me most about this collection is its implications on other poets. While poets struggle to get published, dealing with rejection after rejection, all T-Boz has to do is vomit some words on a page and it gets published. I wish I could give this collection of dung piles a negative rating."
5,Very thoughtful and inspirational!!!!,"I enjoyed tionne's book of poetry and essays...as i was sitting reading her book i knew that she had to go through a lot of trials and tribulations to get where she is emotionally and spiritually. i'm glad that i picked up this book and read it. i feel so great now knowing that im not the only one who is going through hard times dealing with death, weight, insecurities with how i look and act, etc etc...and that life is too short. live life to the fullest and worry about tomorrow when and/or if it gets here later.thanks tionne for your words of wisdom. tboz has a beautiful voice inside and out. :)"
5,Knife,"After so many years using a ""right-handed"" knife I finally fould this one and it is so much more comfortable for me. I now enjoy cutting meats and veggies as it's so much faster/easier."
5,Great product - hard to find and Amazon had it,"Left-handed knives can be tough to find. Kudos to Amazon for carrying this product, and at a great price. With this addition my Shun collection is complete (at least for now - I think Shun builds the best knives in the world)."
5,World's Best Chef's Knife,"I have a set which I received as a wedding gift, and love the quality and how the knife handles. I bought this left-handed version for my mother-in-law, and she's in love, too. German knives can't hold a candle to this model."
1,Hidden Agenda at work,"Cole, a known anti-American radical, has outlined a dangerous proposal based on fabricated instances of government abuses. The Constitution is very clear about citizen/non-citizens. If he wants non-citizens to share the same rights as citizens, then he should support initiatives to topple dictatorships, or at least, trade up in them."
5,"Good, Hot Writing","Editor Paul Willis has done an excellent job with this, his first collection of erotic writing.Of course, the very theme of the book; the concept of the ""sex buddy"", is something that is fairly unique to the gay community yet at the same time very prurient and exciting. Let's face it, sometimes relationships get in the way of the hot sex we all used to have in the beginning, and isn't it better to have someone who knows what you like, that you know how to pleasure, but you don't have to deal with all of the relationship nonsense that goes with it?For a first time editor, Willis has gathered some incredibly formidible names--Felice Picano, Greg Herren, Jameson Currier, M. Christian, Jay Quinn--in addition to some of the top gay writers of erotica today. This gives the book not only some hot and heavy content, but also a degree of literary merit that is usually conspicuously absent from these books.Can't wait for his next one!"
2,Non competitive Britten recording.,"While Previn has made some outstanding recordings of 20th century british music (Holst's ""Planets"", Walton's Sym. no. 1 & Vaughan-Williams symphonies) this is certainly not one of them. The Spring symphony movements are not performed attaca as indicated in the score, but are separated by pauses which are rather annoying. The performance is perfunctory setting it well outside of the competition from Hickox & LSO, Britten's own recording and a recent one from Gardiner. The Sea Interludes omit the vital Passacaglia. I would not recommend ANY recording of the Sea Interludes without this final movement."
5,Dog,Purchased this book as a gift for a 2-yer-old grand daughter. It is a delight to her (and to grandpa!).
2,Product Has Changed,"Been purchasing this product for years. I have enjoyed it's dark color and molasses like taste. I opened a new shipment this morning and immediately noticed that the color of the produce has changed. Instead of the usual dark amber color, the sugar is almost blond. Upon tasting it I found that along with the loss of color it has also lost much of it's unique taste. It's almost like using white sugar. I think this will be the LAST order from this supplier for me."
5,The Great Chris Christian,It holds up so well. He's a very talented singer and song writer. I enjoyed it when it came out decades ago. Terrific to still find it uplifting and of value.
4,Airplane companion,I've read all of the Charlie Parker Mysteries so far. Nice booksto take with you traveling. It's a quick read and nice to follow up on the adventures of Drake and Charlie.
4,Connie Shelton Books,"I am in the process of reading the entire Charlie Parker series. Thus far I am enjoying the books. I often find that the plots are predictable. Often I find that Connie is encumbered with too many details for insignificant events such as the clothes someone is wearing, geography or food. Nevertheless, I feel like part of the family."
3,First time for this author,This is the first book I have read by this author. Was pleasantly surprised to find it was more mystery than romance. It kept my interest and moved along to a good ending.
3,"plenty of sauce, but a little undercooked","Kelly Joe's got the vibe going on this release. Loose, funky moods abound. Great guitar playing as usual. However, his songs have grown over time to include long, intricate narratives. As much as I love his outstanding guitar playing (I'm a lap-style player myself), on this album it seems the two elements are fighting for space. I appreciate the enthusiasm and fun that comes through as Kelly Joe and his accompanyists jam out, but perhaps next time he might craft the songs to better support his wonderful stories."
3,OH NO! not at all what I expected,"Technically the music is very good. Kelly Joe Phelps I believe is incapable of anything less than virtuosity of voice and instrument. However, he does not play any of the wonderful slide guitar of his previous, cutting edge, delicious past three CD's. The liner notes state that the musicians got to together for the first time and recorded the album in three days. Well it shows. I believe that they were able to create a purpousful and deliberate ""feel"" but what I felt was the the music retreated to the category of background music in a loud smokey bar. The CD still has a rough edge and a raw emotional feel but gone is the soulful, tasty guitar/ slide guitar that I find so compelling. Bottom line there are a couple of great tunes on the album but overall not much to sink you teeth into. Kelly Joe please break out your slide and stomp your feet by your bad self."
3,Promising premise that does not deliver,"Tempted to advance-order this title by a full spread ad in PW several months ago, I expected a polished medical thriller, but was disappointed to read a too-long soap opera about a wealthy Nobel prize-winning do-gooder who justifies mass-murder because her adopted son was killed in an African ""ethnic cleansing"" war. Unfortunately, none of the characters incite the reader to care much about them, and the longer you read, the less you care. Had the book been shorter and the self-examinations of the characters been fewer, the story could have been more entertaining. As it is, I can only say that Artemis as a threat let me down."
4,Don't Take It Too Seriously!,"A fast read. It shouldn't be taken too seriously. That a Nobel Prize winner purposely unleashes a plague, and is apparently unaware of the law of unintended consequences is certainly not realistic. That she is obsessed with the position of women in the world and thinks that a single act can have some effect . . sorry, but no. But it is a page turner and is a good read for the beach or on a long flight."
3,The End Justifies the Means,"If an author's job is to get his reader to react, then Mr. Kyle has been extremely successful. There are two stories here. One, of incredible terrorism, that gets you into the book and two of ""the end justifies the means"" that gets your blood boiling. It is the latter that made me want to throw my computer(I had the e-book version) against the wall, because I disagree with the idea of negotiating at the point of a gun. In any case, it was an ejoyable read, which is what one wants out of a good book."
1,Not what it appears,"I have taken a recent interest in reading thrilling books about viruses, infectious diseases, etc. This book, when I read the back cover, sounded like a great plot that I had never seen before. However, once I started to read it the plot immediately went downhill. After the first few chapters the virus disappeared and did not come back until the very end of the book. All the chapters in between were about the political attack on the government and the FBI trying to hunt down the person behind the virus release. It really was a bit ridiculous. If you want a more thrilling read be sure to pick up Deadly Exposure!"
5,Book of misogyny,"This book makes monsters out of brilliant woman and exalts less brilliant man. This author wrote a book which feeds hatred towards women. Just switch the two main characters and make Tory a man. What will you get? A story which reflects the real life! Women in real life are killed by men. Women killing women is highly unrealistic! Why I gave it five stars? Execution of the story: brilliant! But the author should update his knowledge on the topic ""Violence against women""!"
3,"Great Beginning, Mediocre From Then On...","I LOVE medical thrillers. The nastier the virus the better and this one was pretty nasty, especially at first.Unfortunately, I didn't really like any of the characters in the book all that much. Found them hard to warm up too, which affected whether I cared if they lived or died.The first reviewer below (from Florida)felt EXACTLY as I did about this book and that review really sums up how I feel. Check it out."
1,"Worst book ever, almost","The back of this book made me think it would be a good read, and it seemed that might be the case, then the real story started. expecting a fast paced story I got a lot of politicts that never really amounted to anything. If the main character would have been smart he would have helped the FBI from the begining. The characters in the story were stupid, they didnt make you want to like them, they were arogant with themselves. I wasted 6 bucks on this book. The forced love affair by a few of the main characters still eludes me. Garbage."
1,It sucks,"This book started out as a interesting read but about halfway thru it became self absorbed with bashing the establilshment and pushing the tree hugger liberal good, normal society bad agenda. The FBI was vilanized and the morally bankrupt Tory was held up as an far sighted idealist that was always right. Yuk! I threw it in the trash, sorry if I steped on toes but this book is rank."
3,Not what I expected,"I have no doubt that Warren ""Bing"" Evans is a true hero, but I didn't find his story of love nor war was adequately told. The details on each were very superficial and weak. I credit the authors with this, not the man they wrote about. Unfortunate."
1,Lasted one day!,My husband bought this for our goldendoodle. He loved it and even slept with it between his paws but the next morning chewed the squeeky part out and left bits of plastic onthe floor everywhere. I need an indestrucible squeeky toy like this!
1,Wrong size,Either we received the wrong part or they cannot measure as these donuts are only 4 inches in diameter not 6 inches as advertised.
5,Japanese hair oil,I have never used hair oil before except when at the hair salon. I was in Japan and decided to try this to control my frizz. It's is wonderful!!
4,good for keeping away greys,"i donno how it does it but whenever i use this i have less greys.. so i'm using it as a natural product to keep my hair dark..(i am asia, and my hair started to grey in my late 20s and being a health nut i'm reluctant to use chemical dyes) this does not keep all greys away. but controls it with acceptable results.. so it's good alternative to using chemical hair dyes."
4,I love it !,I use this oil for my hair and skin care. I read about this oil is better than Olive oil.
4,Great for Skin and Hair but too Expensive.,I've used this on my skin and hair and it works great. This is not 100% pure as it contains some sort of light fragrance. I found a 100% pure bottle of Camellia oil much much cheaper [...]
3,THE BEST -- Just love it!,"I didn't have to wait a long time for the Camellia oil, it came very quickly and the product exceeds what i expected. I will be ordering again."
3,look good but finish is not great quality,"Paint chipped when installing and brackets are a little flimsy when stepping on them, hopefully they will hold up after continued use"
1,BAD PRODUCT-DO NOT BUY-DOES NOT WORK,I FIRST RAN THE CD DISK AND THEN PLUG INTO UNIT. IT DID NOT WORK. THAT WAS $30 DOWN THE TUBE.
4,It works!,"This adapter is pretty small like a regular thumb/jump/flash-drive. Roughly 2 1/4"" x 1"" x 1/4"" including the usb end. It is currently working with my belkin wireless router and is really covenient considering I didn't want to open my cpu and install any hardware. The software could have been better though, it looks almost user-unfriendly, but it really have all the basic necessities used to configure the adapter. A newbie may be turned off by the software but as long as you can read, and know what to configure, you should be OK! No problems so far!"
2,"Horrible Software, Doesn't install","The Iogear does not install properly - I tried installing this on three different computers, and it wouldn't instal AT ALL on two of them. On the third computer is works, but only with minimal usage. It makes the computer slow down drastically and even freeze. The software itself also isn't very good, but I do recognize that the software on these are generally poor, so this doesn't only hold for Iogear. Regardless, this product was a waste of time and doesn't work well at all."
3,Wireless networking adapter from I/O gear,"While the product works great, the installation was horrific. It is not microsoft certified. This caused major problems. It took me an hour to get it all set up and running. Now i have to turn off the software that came with the product to get it to work. But it does it's job."
1,IOGEAR Wi-Fi 54g USB Adapter,"I am very disappointed about this wireless adapter. Very difficult to make it work on my computer. After hours of talking to the IOGEAR tech support and my my moderm maker of AT&T;, and still not able to make it work.Kai"
4,Works plug and play with Linux,"Great product. Works out-of-the-box without any configuration in Ubuntu 10.10, 11.04 and Mint 10 Julia. Just plug it in, boot up and BOOM! you're online. It might not receive signal quite as well as other dongles/ wireless cards I've used but that doesn't really matter for me. It works and the ease of use easily makes up for this. I'm sure it also works out of the box in other debian-based distros."
3,Worked great but now glitchy,"I got this and it has worked well, started running really really hot no matter what I was doing. Loses connection at times, especially if I power off the computer at night and getting reconnected is a pain.Might try another brand. Have only had a couple months. Maybe it's getting tired but seems too soon to be misbehaving. :^("
2,Low signal level,The SW installation went find. Need to reboot after driver installed and then device is recognized.I use several computers in my family room with my wireless hub upstairs. All get full strength except this one. This one gives me one bar low quality all the time and disconnects for 10-20 seconds once every fifteen minutes or so.
5,Works great!,"Works great... a little tricky on the initial set up for the WEP, but works everytime..."
5,Great find!,"I have owned this device for 4 months now. I was nervious when I ordered this. I had used many different usb wireless cards. Linksys, Netgear, Verizon, and SMC. In comparison, this is better. I got the device installed the drivers and it worked. I've had to reload my computer a few times and lost the CD. I went to the company website, entered the product on the drivers page and the drivers downloaded. I have used this on XP and Vista and it worked fine on both. No hastle. It gets a strong signal every time. My linksys and Net gear used to overheat after about 2 hours. They would shut off for a few minutes and I would have to unplug it. This has never done that to me. For the price, this is a quality product."
4,Insightful,Moe Norman was a man that few people really knew and the author tells the story of those around him that knew him best. He was an outsider but was one of the best ball strikers in history who never really made it to the top because of his social anxiety. Shows the other side of the coin of a sport that one rarely ever sees.
3,Wasn't into this Champion CD,"This 3rd or 4th release from Eric Champion was a little disappointing when I first received it. There are a couple of catchy tracks, mainly the title track and Rainbow Jam. But this album was progressively darker and more preachy than his earlier CD's.I don't know if anyone else will even be looking for this one anymore, since Eric seemed to fall out of mainstream contemporary christian music."
1,I'm an optimist...but the pitcher is still half-empty,"Leaked after a few weeks... the worst part is, PUR said it's not covered under warranty because it's a ""wear and tear"" item. It sits on the counter, I have no idea what wear and tear that causes on the internal gasket. They kept me going in circles and after the 30 day satisfaction guarantee expired, they then told me I could have returned it within the first 30 days but now it's too late. For a product based on the razor/razor-blade business model (I'm sure the real money for them is made from the filters, not the pitchers), this is a horrible way for them to deal with the situation. Oh, and I had another one crack by itself due to temperature differences (it was in the fridge). When it works, the water is great, but it needs to stay contained in the container."
1,limited value,purchased 3/21/04 29.99put in use 06/12/04started to leak 01/19/05not a happy consumer .leaks @ bottom seamwill call pur an see what they'll do ?was very careful an not abused . just used for coffee brewing water4
2,3rd Pur Pitcher....3rd Leaking Pitcher,Great Water! That is why it got a 2...otherwise it would have receive a 0.I DO love the look of that pitcher...but every one I have seen leaks after just a month or two...it leaks from the bottom seal and that is what makes it worthless. I thought that I could just replace it and get a new one and it would be ok...it did the same thing....3 times in a row...good thing I only paid for it once. I have a friend that replaced hers after the same issue and her second one did the same thing. I gave up on this and looking for another picture.ATTN PUR Company!!!! Fix the leaking issue and I will come running back to buy a new one.
2,Happened to me too,I got this pitcher about 5 months ago and sure enough I ran into the same leaking problems like everyone else. I should have checked up on this pitcher before the purchase from Target. Good thing my mom bought it and not me.
1,Leaks,"I love water filters, this perhaps is my third, first was a Brita, gave to family member years ago and it is still in use, went on to faucet style but prefer pitchers, then to this Ultra. This pitcher leaks, I suspect it is the style, leak is not big-time, but pitcher will have to be replaced wayyyy too soon in a household where there is no rough treatment of kitchen items. I am NOT happy.Elaine"
1,TERRIBLE,"Not only did I order a book in ""good"" condition, and it came in ""awful"" condition....I ordered a hardcover, and it was a paperback! I have given this company two chances and they have failed miserably both times! Terrible Liars."
4,Jammin,"I must admit this is probably the best cd I have heard this year. The different artist on the album is great. It has all the good artist out today. Now with the R$B mix I truly enjoy Brian Mcknight, but Case is running in a tight second. Now with the hip hop scene my boy Jay Z has that one locked down, but my girl Eve isn't playing either. Anyone with knowledge of music should enjoy this cd. I hope the movie is just as good."
1,Really Lame,What Happen to the days of Curtis Mayfield Soundtracks?when a Soundtrack made sense.the Lead-off track the Janet Jackson Doesn't Really Matter is a Poor Mya Rip off of the Rugrats Take Me There.it's Janet's Worst Song Ever.The THong Re-Mix is pure Record Label Greed.Leave well enough alone.JAy-Z should Retire.unlike the first Nutty Professor Soundtrack this one comes out Weak.
5,This is DEFINITELY THE BEST SDTK OF 2000!,"This soundtrack is phenomenal! Not only does Janet shine with ""Doesn't really matter"", but the soundtrack gracefully mixes r&b and rap on one cd and it really works. Not only that but it introduces a few new artists with excellent songs. One of the best songs on the soundtrack is #9 ""No you didn't say"" by new artist Kandice Love. While the entire sdtk is great, the standouts are #1,3,4,5,8,9,11,14,& 15. Get this album!"
5,Marvelous Read,"Everyone who loves history or just likes a good story will enjoy this book. Dr. Van Sant has created a broad collective report of the Japanese settlers that is built upon the stories of individuals. Overall, it is insightful, informative, educational, and entertaining. A fascinating book on an often ignored topic.George Robbins"
2,The synopsis in the back is the entire book,"The book is fine, but it in the back is a boiled down synopsis, about 5 pages, that suffices for the entire book. The rest of the book doesn't really add that much. The material here is good, but is available by reading a few white papers and faq's on the web. I didn't dislike the book, I just wish I hadn't spent the money."
1,This is not the textbook.,"We thought we had ordered the textbook, Microeconomics: Principles, Problems, and Policies by McConnell and Brue. This book however is Selected Material from Microeconomics. The Table of Contents is the same as the textbook, so this is really confusing. Be sure you get what you want."
3,Nice,A couple of the lids are extremely loose and there are some bubbles in the glass. Otherwise they are nice.
4,Grizzly with a red paint job?,"Compare the specs/photos between this one and the Grizzly models under $300 (i.e. G0491) -- I'd bet a fair amount that this drill press is manufactured in the same factory (in China of course).This is definitely not a high end machine, but overall I'm pleased with what I got for just over $200. It took about an hour to set up -- no assembly instructions are provided, but you can figure it out by looking at the schematic. It runs fine and gets all the drilling jobs done in my home shop.Would definitely recommend the Mountain for those who want a decent drill press without spending a whole lot."
1,Minimalistic,"The guide never goes further than ""This type beats this type"", which anyone who has ever played pokemon after 1998 knows by common sense. it's useless, minimalistic, and only worth the money if you for some reason like to collect pokemon stadium guides."
5,Perfect!,"I didn't realize how much of my hair was sitting in the trap until we had to replace some plumbing. My husband found a hairball the size of a small animal in the pipes. I decided that I shouldn't let that happen again so I ordered this strainer. It works great for hair. It's amazing how much hair you don't realize you're loosing until it shows up in the basket.I usually take this out to drain the tub after a bath. It slows the draining down a good bit. It's still worth the trade off, though."
5,Fabulous Blanket,I started purchasing the Peacock Alley All Seasons Blanket 12 years ago. I have 4 I use on my beds and they are fantastic! They hold up well and are a perfect all-season weight. I purchased an additonal one recently to use on a new sofa fed. I like the natural color.
4,Fits at&t Tilt,"This case is not as elegant as some leather cases you can find, and it looks bulkier than the leather cases. However, it has more pockets to let you store more stuff, and the Bluetooth headset holder is a plus. Its belt clip is very secured.Please note that NiteIze also makes a version of Clip Case Plus for PDAs/Smartphones. That version is too big for the at&t; Tilt. This one is almost perfect for the Tilt/HTC Kaiser.This magnet version is better than the velcro one."
3,Memories fade,Is this what we all fell in love with when our college friends wore it? Wow memories fade. Its not as good as the memories.
3,THE ELITE 'S BY BARBRA COLE,"REVEWED BY SCOTTY THOMPSON LAS VEGAS NV, THERE ARE TWO ELITES, A HISTORY OF THE RHODESIAN SAS AND HER COMPANION THE ELETE PICTORIAL. BOTH ARE UNQUESTIONALY THE BEST ON THE WAR IN RHODESIA.BOTH INDESPENSABLE!! NO COLD WAR LIBIRARY SHOULD BE WITH OUT BOTH!! DO NOT READ ONE WITHOUT THE OTHER!! BARBRA COLE IS WALKING LIVING HISTORY! THEY WILL MAKE YOU CRY. THERE IS ONLY ONE C TROOP! SEMPER FI ""AT THE GOING DOWN OF THE SUN AND IN THE MORNING, WE WILL NOT FORGET THEM, WE WILL NOT FORGET THEM"""
3,The Author Has an Annoying Writing Style,"The author begins many paragraphs with an incomprehensible sentence, but does usually recover with great ""for examples"". Even after reading the book and feeling comfortable with the material, I went back to read some of those incomprehensible sentences and still found them incomprehensible.This isn't an easy read."
4,Always on my desk,"I found this book a comprehensive guide to the last version of UML language.The value of the book is in the clear and plain language used to introduce the UML features, as well as in the integration with topics like MDA (Model Driven Architecture), analysis, development methodologies.The MDA chapter resembles too much the stuff published on the OMG website, and results too abstract in comparison with the rest of the book.Be careful at the different reading levels allowed by this text: sometimes tiny annotations masks relevant topics!I always have this book on my desk, and I use it as a reference often."
5,Great background,I used to listen to my parent's LP of Shankar's Three Ragas. I'm psyched to have it again... it's great to listen to while I'm working or crafting.
4,my first time,this is my first shankar purchase and it is very worth it. this presents three different styles and sounds great. the audio quality is good. very much worth the price if you want to take a chance with this music.
3,In Memory of Pandit Ravi Shankar,Pandit Ravi Shankar who passed away recently prompted me to order The Ravi Shankar Collection: Three Ragas. After listening I felt that may be thgis was for the Western listeners to be introduced to Sitar. I would like to go a bit deeper.
4,Long overdue reissue on CD,"This is Ravi Shankar's first LP, recorded in 1956, and serves as a fine introduction to his music and Indian classical in general.I bought a used vinyl copy of this album in the early 90s, and had been looking for a CD issue ever since. Finally, in 2000, Angel Records has digitally remastered and reissued this album. Track two, Raga Ahir Bhairav, is my favorite Indian classical music piece. I would have bought this disc for that track alone.Don't let the short track list fool you into thinking this is a short album; this CD clocks in at 54:55.The sound quality of this remaster is quite good, considering the age of the master tapes, though there are a few places where one channel drops out briefly. I rarely notice these moments, and even when I do they don't detract from the quality of the music. The sound is certainly much better than my old vinyl LP!"
3,"Baby, you're the ginchiest!","This is a ridiculously short CD featuring songs from the early 1960s sung by TV stars. All of these songs were hits, with the exception of Dwayne Hickman's song. As for the quality of the songs, well, Ricky Nelson's is great. The rest of the songs range in quality from pretty good to terrible. Here is the complete track listing:1. Hello Mary Lou - Ricky Nelson2. Johnny Angel - Shelly Fabares3. Cindy's Birthday - Johnny Crawford4. Kookie, Kookie (Lend Me Your Comb) - Edd ""Kookie"" Byrnes5. Sixteen Reasons - Connie Stevens6. My Dad - Paul Petersen7. Theme From Dr. Kildare - Richard Chamberlain8. Teach Me Tonight - George Maharis9. I Pass Your House - Dwayne Hickman"
1,Color Boredom Spinner,"I bought this as a Black Friday special and if I had paid more than the $10 for it, I would have definitely RETURNED it. Prepare to be letdown! Vivid colors shown on box do not exist and the spinner doesn't rotate nearly fast enough even with fresh batteries. All our finished projects basically looked the same - not at all what appears on box. I'd be curious too as to where you could find refill paper and ""magic ink"" for this and what it costs b/c it only comes with a few sheets of paper. Both my kids forgot about this dud of a toy within minutes of opening it on Xmas day."
1,refills non-existent,"This product worked ok but for $27 it is not worth the money. It is neater than the spin art of the 70's but you have no choice of color as you did when you were dripping actual paint -- it comes with paper already colored for you and the clear liquid exposes the colors already there. It's still messy, the liquid is a gel-goo that gets everywhere, and it spews black goo into the sides of the unit. The refills cost $7 and I have been searching for a year and cannot find them anywhere except online (with $6 shipping charge). The funky different papers they advertise cannot be found anywhere, not even online. Plus, to get the paper to fit in the unit you have to fold it -- huh? That's kind of dumb, it should have been manufactured to fit, the way the old spin art used to. If you want spin art, buy a spin art, because this unit is terrible. Don't waste your money."
4,Pleased,"I recently bought this fun art toy and played with it last night. It was a lot of fun for myself, my boyfriend, and his 11 year old son. We were immediately addicted to playing with it and experimenting with markers, explosion drops, and our own supplies. Originally I purchased this product for my church for a preschool party we're having, but I'm going to have to keep this one for myself. It is easy to go through the paper quickly, but any paper could be used. Same goes for paints. Just water down some poster paint and you're good to go. Make sure you purchase 3 C batteries and you're good to go. I just hope the motor has a long life."
1,Worst Toy I bought This Christmas!,"In my opinion this is an overpriced junk toy/craft set. The brilliant colors on the package are certainly NOT what you get when you use the spinner. In fact, the finished product is a small piece of black paper with very pitiful, pale, nondescript blotches of color. I bought two sets for my two grandkids, and the LED lights did not work on one of them. The kids were very disappointed. When the adults tried the sets, the results were the same.Could not believe the complete lack of quality coming from a company like Crayola."
3,solution refills not necessary,"Even though I am not thoroughly impressed with this product, my kids (ages 5 and 6) seem to think it is fun enough. We used up the solution very quickly, so we tried using drops of water instead. IT WORKS! I know there is something other than water in the solution because it takes more water than solution to get the picture to work. But it DOES indeed work with water."
1,very poor quality,My boys got the crayola spinner for christmas and have only used it twice. This toy was not thought out at all. It seems that the company was in such a hurry to get the spinner on the market that they didn't take the time to make sure it worked properly. We were very upset that couldn't get the results pictured on the box. The lights stopped working after 15 minutes and the batteries didn't last much longer. Don't waste your money on this product. Stick with the origional color wonder books and paper.
2,Didn't make me smile,"This product was a flop, it did not excite my daugher after the first painting. We could not get the swirl to corporate, regardless of the amount of drops added. I would not purchase again for anyone.Crayola Color Explosion Designer"
1,Don't waste your money on another worthless toy,"My 6 year old son saw this on tv and thought he had to have it. He got it for his birthday, he literally opened it put in batteries and played around with it for 25 minutes trying to get it to do something, then asked for my help, it just didn't do anything, you drip a liquid on the paper and it shows some color thats already on the paper and whirls messy oil around the inside, he said, ""oh lets take this back."" So that is what we did, get a couple notepads and markers would be way better than this. It looks nothing like the commercials on tv, sadly this is just another toy that wastes parents time and money."
1,I'm Done with Crayola,"Crayola has disappointed my son several times over his 7 years, but this does it. There's no pretty colors...we only got one pattern of paper with one color design. Small amount of paper, and not much solution. Just cheap and now I'm convinced not to buy Crayola again, their products have become so low quality. I'll just stick to the crayons."
2,not worth the $$$..NOT air tight,"I think the description is misleading...there is nothing air tight about these canisters. They are regular canisters, their lids fit in a ridge in the top of the canister, but it's not snug enough to have the air tight effect. I bought it for coffee beans and that is why I am so disappointed. Another thing, you see in the picture that there is a round steel part counter to the nob of the cover..you screw the nobs to it...well I received one that does not belong to this set and its screw did not match either. I improvised something to keep them since I hate the hassle of returning. I gave it 2 stars (for me it's not even worth 1 star) because if you are not looking for an air tight canisters...you might want to try it, they have a classic look and their sizes are functional. Hope this helped."
3,Sprayer Feels and Looks Cheap!,All of the parts are quality and heavy-duty EXCEPT the sprayer. It feels and looks like plastic with the same finish but does work well.
3,Nice Faucet but Quality Issues,Bought this faucet and returned it since the finish had sharp bumps in it that you could feel when you rubbed your hand over the faucet. Cleaning with a paper towel would actually rip the paper towel. I contacted Kohler but they wouldn't stand behind the product. I was VERY disappointed in Kohler's lack of response on this. It was clearly a plating defect but they did not want to help. I could not wait for the returns process to get a replacement so I had to purchase another one elsewhere that also had this defect but to a much lesser extent. Once installed it's a very nice faucet. Feels meaty and looks great. Too bad the lack of manufacturer backing of their product tarnished an otherwise nice faucet.
2,Homeowner,"Upon recieving the Kohler sink faucet it only contained three parts, the spray was not included. The box had no return address and the enclosed information also did not have a return address. I had to go to a local retailer and find an additional sprayer that would go with the set.Usually using computer mail order items are easier to get however, this was very complicated."
5,Freakin nice,"If you have any interest in artist that truly reestablish the concepts that every aspects of our lives are Art, then you must look at this book. Tom Friedman is F**k**g nuts, you won't be disappointed."
1,a joke,"Tom Friedman's work is laughably bad. Every piece in the book is a contrived and inhibited gimick. The artist tries too hard to please his audience, & in my opinion pleases no one. Tom Friedman is an insult to the art world, and to the intelligence of anyone who lays eyes on his work."
5,From a Grandmother's point of view,This program is totally interactive. My grandson -- who is two and a half and has a two and a half year old's attention span spent 25 to 30 minutes at a time playing with the shapes and bubble castle. A wonderful experience
5,Excellent learning package for up to age 3.,"My son received Reader Rabbit Toddler as a gift and we are sold on it's ability to help him learn while having fun. He loves to do all of the tasks and is learning colors, shapes and a host of other skills. The true test of a software program is the willingness to buy the next level - we are doing just that by upgrading to the Preschool program."
5,Fantastic and engaging software for young minds,"I'm impressed with the variety and level of activities the Reader Rabbit programs offer. I have a four-year old who is constantly finding new things with the Preschool software, and my three-year old is actively engaged with the Toddler software. Getting it as a bundle saved a bundle! Both kids like watching what the other is doing. They sing along with the songs and can't wait until they can play on the computer. This is much better software than we've had previous experiences with. I'd whole-heartedly recommend it to anyone thinking of purchasing children's educational software."
3,A great Berlioz conductor in low gear,"Davis had a long tenure in Bavaria and made a lot of recordings for RCA during that period. But he was often slack and uninvolving in his music-maing, to the point that one wondered why he stayed on. Now that he is back with the London Sym., Davis sounds much more his old self, though he still lapses into fits of sleepwalking.This collection of Berlioz overtures is careful and detailed, and in very good sound. But who cares? Without fire and passion Berlioz simply isn't Berlioz. Go back to Davis's ealaier CD of overtures on Philips, dating from the Sixties and Seventies when he was younger and much more energetic. This collection is second-best at best."
1,This doesn't fit,"Bought a 40"" Bravia and this which should fit to 42"", there is no way it will fit this TV"
3,"Write in haste, repent at leisure.","This book has a few merits. It does advance several of the earlier Destroyer novels' plot lines. It does contain some humorous scenes. It is unfortunately marred by poor editing (frequent spelling errors, some sentences that are unfathomable). The novel's tone throughout is that of a hurried effort.I can still recommend it to those who have followed the series from the beginning, but, it would not be a good introduction for a first time reader."
5,Tim Somheil proved he could do it!,"After seeing some promise but inconsistency from Tim's Destroyer books, I was hesitant to pick up the last Gold Eagle Destroyer novel. Fortuneately some of the guys in the aggressor_series group at yahoo suggested getting this one.I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The characters were well-written and the plot was interesting and moved rapidly. Even the dialogue and interaction was in character this time out.Anyone who is a fan of the series (especially the older books) should pick this up. I seriously believe you'll love it."
3,Elememtary level publication,I was looking for a much more advanced Taxonomy guide. This is more suited for 5th or 6th graders. At least I did not waste much money on it. No complaints against the seller - other than the low lwvel on the book should have been stated.
2,"""Linux"" support is a SAD JOKE.","Linux support (sic) consists of a Makefile and driver source code specific to an ANCIENT (March 2004) Linux kernel (2.4) for Red Hat Linux versions 7.3, 8, and 9. These are absolutely obsolete. It may run on Windows, but any mention of Linux needs to be either removed or severely qualified."
3,The page does not tell us the size of the product,"This site describes a product that has an excellent reputation from users that I know. However, it does not tell us the size that is being sold. How many feet is in this roll? How many square feet are being purchased. This is important information."
4,SQ FT for 563437,150 SQ FT. Go to the preen website and check out the three different sizes listed and check the product code 563437[...]
1,I wish I had spent my amazon credit on anything else,"I had a small Amazon credit and when I was switching apartments, I really needed to restock a few basic items. I thought it would cost-effective to use a small balance on a relatively expensive but much-needed spatula.This might have been the worst spatula I've ever interacted with. Granted, the competitive set is only 4-5 spatulas total, but I was shocked at how quickly it melted and discolored. It's definitely not heatproof and I threw it away after the first two uses. This might be good for something cold (like...a pan of jello?) but for anyone who uses spatulas for cooking, this is not the answer."
3,Forgotten Romance,"La Vienta left me a little cold on this one. Jazzmenco and Night Dance were better.Nonetheless was happy to add this disc to my collection.It is pleasant to listen to but lacks the warmth and drive of their two previous endeavours. Perhaps I expected to much from a title such as this. Forgotten Romance is suppose to take the listener to a time in his or her life that was special.In my humble opinion it fell somewhat short of the mark.No doubt others will find the album right on for their memories.I eagerly await La Vientas next release. I am a fan of these artist,as well as Acoustic Alchemy."
5,Classic French weds international cuisine!,"Susan Herrmann Loomis' COOKING AT HOME ON RUE TATIN (0060758171, $24.95) comes from a cookbook author and pro chef who surveys French home cooking. Classic French techniques and dishes meld with international cuisine in a title which also takes the busy cook into account. From a simple Braised Fennel and Chicken with Artichoke to Leek and Bacon Quiche and Mackerel with Dandelion Greens, this is packed with innovations and basics alike."
5,Now this is one good sharpener,"I sure wish I could find this locally as the price with shipping is a bit high. However, it is a great sharpener for crayons, which is what I was looking for. My grandchildren really enjoy using it and it made super points on the crayons."
1,Look for another book .....,I found this author to give very few tips for the cost of his book or DVD. His instructiuon are confusing.
4,An Excellent Position Specific Baseball Instructional Program!,"An excellent program that shows drills that are very practical plus some key techniques and tips.For instance, showing the catcher exactly how far to set up behind the batter.Also fielding bunts in front of home plate and how to catch foul pops. Plus much more!What is interesting about this program is that catchers will learn the positionand be able to continuously use this program as a resource as they continueto play the catching position.

1,more like de-still ed life of shit,it is jazzy boom bazzy kind kind oif caxzzy flwin like mowin the lawn till dawn or till the cow you own come back to your home word!
1,Argh!!!,"Personally i'm no fan of the shoe, but giving it a horn? They just went too far now! I was horning my shoe when that piece of junk shattered and shards of it hit me in the face, and my foot, $2000 surgery, plastic poisoning appearantly melting plastic only makes it worse, this reviewer gives shoe horns a big thumbs down."
5,Carnivora,Serpieri is the best! One of the few erotic comics with taste and artistic sense. And incredibly horny ofcourse. It's a pity that the publisher pushes Serpieri to censorship. It shouldn't have to be incomplete and seperately collected in an uncensored album like druuna X and X2. A little more broadmindedness of the publisher would be nice.
3,Science fiction w/ gratuitous nudity,"meh. It's science fiction, with a plot typical of the early 70's. The nudity is entirely gratuitous and does not advance the plot nor is it particularly erotic. The artwork is nice."
4,500 murder cases from a to z,"The most sensational murders and murderers of the last 150 years are gathered in this book. This is a kind of encyclopedia that gives a short explanation for every murder case, filled with photographs, drawings and sketches. Not only cases from the United States and Europe, but from all around the world. All cases are alphabetized from a to z, which wasn't such a great idea. But at the end of the book there is a bibliography of about a thousand true crime books. A great work of reference for every true crime fan!"
5,Great karate movie at a bargain price!!,"Purchased one for my nephew who is a karate aficionado and he really enjoyed the movie. It is a low cost movie region free, which doesn't affect us any.We have seen similar titles at a much greater price, so we were happy to save the money and get a movie that is a cult classic!Great karate movie at a bargain price!"
3,Indie retelling of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre,"This film was not groundbreaking in originality. It, like many other films of its type, is simply a reimagining of the story of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.However, this film is worth watching. The story of ""BROTHER"" with his metal teeth and hunger for flesh is horrifying. His brothers are fiercly devoted to family and dedicated to keeping Brother safe and well fed. The actor portraying Jones, Parrish Randall, does an excellent job - giving his body and sanity to the character. Jimmy Hazzard perfectly complements him as his insane brother.The gore f/x are great - covered in blood and dripping with gore. The cinematography is beautiful and the lighting is perfect.If you enjoyed Texas Chainsaw Massacre, you must see this film."
1,I don't buy products that are advertised by SPAMMING,"I have never tried this product, and I never will. In fact I will never buy any product by this company for the simple reason that the only way I have ever heard of them is because I just received their spam."
5,Breathless!!,"WOW. That's all I have to say. I could not believe he did not achieve any type of fame until ""Book Thief""! This book is just as touching. This whole Wolfe family moved me and made me cheer for them. He depicts what a family is all about - none of the materialistic things, but the support and love. Amazing, amazing. As in his other books, don't let the ""young adult"" categorization turn you off!!"
5,Fabulous,"My first introduction to MZ and I devoured everything after. FRW is still his best work. I picked it up and didn't put it down until I was done. Can't say that with his other stuff. ( except GTG )Colorful characters,unique voice, realistic plot and high emotion makes this an unforgettable keeper."
2,Glucomannan,I also saw this on Dr. Oz. I have been taking if for about a week now and for some reason...fiber has an opposite affect on me. I won't be buying this product again. If anyone can tell me why this happened...I'd like to know.
2,Warning,"WARNING: If you had any type of bariatric surgery (gastric bypass, banding, etc.) or any other procedure regarding your stomach or digestive system, you should definitely check with your doctor before taking this product. This product expands when digested, which can be detrimental to your health."
1,DID NOTHING,"I was truly excited for this product to work, did nothing. It was the equivalent of taking saw dust pills, which is a possibility of what is actually in it. Oh well, time to try something else."
4,Diet pills,So far so good. Saw this product mentioned on Dr. Oz as best diet pills of 2010. Giving it a try.
2,No difference,"I have not seen or felt any thing different since I started this supplement. I watched the Dr. Oz show regarding this products and that is why I purchased it. Wasting money on supplements for better health can sometimes really be a waste of money. Basically, eating correctly and a little exercise would probably accomplish more. In these tough economic time (financially) be very careful how you spend your money. Walking is free and much more enjoyable."
1,Didn't work for me and also caused me stomach problems,"I'm afraid I did not get a good result from trying this product, Nature's Way Glucomannan in 180 Vcaps. I did not experience any weight loss, and after about a month I started having stomach problems. Once I quit taking the Glucommanan, the symptoms went away, though it did take a couple of weeks before I felt normal once again. Because of this, I cannot really recommend this product to anyone."
3,Worked but hurt stomach,"Mixed reviews on this. The good-- absolutely worked as described. I read enough about it to take a small dose and become acclimated to it. Absolutely worked as described in so far as making me feel full and totally reduced how much I ate. The BAD-- wicked bad stomach pains (like appendicitis pains) after taking this for a few days. I never took a full dose so don't think that's it and maybe ended up taking 2 a day total (1 in the morning, 1 in afternoon) and to be doubled over nearly crying in pain is not cool. I might try it again later... but as it is, I stopped taking after a week and sure enough, the pain went away so very likely the pills. I'd give this 5 stars for working... but only the 3 because of the severity of the stomach pain."
2,Not impressed,"I am a big fan of Dr.Oz and have tried a few of the supplements etc that he has recommended on his show, this being one of them. I was disappointed in the results. To be honest, I don't need to lose weight, I am a personal trainer and a female bodybuilder but I do like to test products that may benefit my clients. Can 't say I was impressed by this product. The only thing I got was digestive upset. Very disappointed."
2,Warning- Nature's Way Increased The Size Of The Capsule,"I have been taking Nature's Way Glucommannan before meals for several months and the Glucomannan itself has been fantastic. It has helped control my appetite and lose weight, and my LDL cholesterol dropped significantly after I started taking it.However, Nature's Way just increased the size of the capsule from a ""0"" to a ""00"" size. It has the same dosage as before, it's just in a much larger capsule that I found significantly harder to swallow.Because of the increase in capsule size I am going to try Soloray brand Glucomannan, which Soloray's customer service tells me is in the ""0"" size capsule that Nature's Way used to be. I hope Nature's Way switches back to the original capsule size."
1,nature's bounty glucomannan,this product did not make me feel full at all!! it is great as far as fiber but had a terrible side effect of making you have gas all day!!!

3,A little disappointed,"I only took two capsules instead of the recommended dosage of three, and woke up in the middle of the night with horrible diarrhea. Maybe my stomach is just too sensitive. I might give it another try, but I definitely expected this product to be more gentle."
1,Did nothing,I noticed no difference in my appetite or how I felt in general. Followed recommended guidelines on bottle and nothing. Save your money.
2,No change noticed,I've been taking this for a month along with raspberry ketone and green coffee bean and haven't really noticed any difference in appetite or weight loss. I already have a 1200 cal/day diet and some exercise. I can't say that this has facilitated my weight loss goals at all.
4,Nice pots but picture is a bit deceiving,"This is a very nice set of cookware. However, I was disappointed because I thought the lids were glass. They are stainless steel. Well made, but I would have preferred glass lids. The photo of the set is deceiving, because the lids look like glass. Still a good deal for the money."
2,Not as good as others on the subject,"This book seemed outdated and doom and gloom. I didn't care for how it was written, or how it made me feel like my sex life was over, my soft skin was over, and I would shrivel up and age quicker because I was having a hysterectomy. What a crock! The Essential Guide to Hysterectomyby Lauren F. Streicher is a MUCH better book. Save your money and buy that one instead!"
2,Disappointed,"I think this book is probably appropriate for women who have little or no choice but to have a hysterectomy, because the book could help give them a positive approach and lots of information on what they might face. But if you are seeking alternatives, this book won't give you much information. It is a book which is very positive and supportive about this procedure (dare I say slanted?) and should be of benefit mainly to patients seeking this treatment. Many studies are briefly cited in the chapter bibliography notes, but in very little detail, so there is the frustrating sensation that this book is only the tip of an iceberg of information for the woman who really wants to be fully informed.My feeling is I wish that I had not bought it becuase it offered very little new, beneficial information for me."
3,"A good attempt, but misses medically","This is a good attempt to explain the medical aspects of hysterectomy, but is clearly written by non-physicians who don't quite understand many medical aspects of the procedure. Some of the information is confusing, some is out dated, and some is just wrong. As a gynecologist, I routinely read what's out there. This is not a book I would recommend to my patients. Books that are more medically accurate are Wallach's book ( boring) and Streicher's book(very engaging)."
5,Absolutely Indespensible!!,I found this book to be an easily read straight forward book about hysterectomy. It starts out with a basic biology lesson on the female anatomy which some people may not need but others will. It is laid out in a way that it can be either read from front to back or you can look at the sections that apply to your case. I am facing a hysterectomy in 9 days and this book has helped me to make several decisions as well as helping to come up with questions I didn't even know I needed the answers for regarding life both before and after surgery. If you are looking for alternatives this is not the book for you. If you are looking for answers about the fine points of hysterectomy and life after hysterectomy this is a wonderful resource. It has helped to ease a lot of the anxiety that I have been experiencing purely by filling in the spaces in my knowledge of hysterectomy. It even covers sex after hysterectomy! A hard topic to find in any book!
5,Loved this workout! Fun and effective!,"This workout is easily one of the best water workouts I've ever tried. The instructions are so helpful! I know what to do even when I'm not looking at the screen, which is really nice when you're outside and the tv is a little further away. And the workout itself is such a good workout! Very effective while still being really fun! I highly recommend this dvd to anyone who is looking for a really fun, well made, effective water workout."
5,"Awesome ruler, terrible shipping price","I bought this ruler for guitar setup and I am extremely happy with its performance.CONSTRUCTION:The ruler is a bit flexible, but it is a very strong and quality ruler. It has crisp, clear, and accurate markings with imperial on one side and metric on the other. I just wish it had markings on the back of the ruler as sometimes it is a pain having to read it when setting up different parts of the guitar.PACKAGING:It arrived well packaged and was in perfect conditionPRICE:At $6.80 it is a steal, but with 6.94 for shipping that is a little steep. It would be just as easy to throw it in an envelope and mail it, it is compact and not heavy.CONCLUSION:I'd recommend this product, especially for guitar setup. I keep it in my case with my tuner, capo, and strings."
1,Not accurate!,"This ruler is just not accurate! I wouldn't order this from here, you don't always get what you pay for."
2,Stupid,"It would probably work well if you had the keg sitting on the floor and drank it quickly, because it goes by temperature. Inside my kegorator it always reads full. I should have known better."
3,"Temp reads well, amount of beer not so much",Strip reads temp well but doesn't read amount of beer remaining in keg. I have used this on three kegs and same result. Granted I have only used it on five gallong kegs (small keg) but they are the same height as a standard keg.
1,Keg thermometer,"I purchased one for me and one for my brother as a stocking stuffer. Although I have not tried mine yet, my brother tells me that the thermometer strip does not adhere to the keg because of the ridges in the keg. He tells me he can't use it."
1,Useless,It won't stick to the keg. I waited for weeks to get the keg and try it and what a disapointment!
